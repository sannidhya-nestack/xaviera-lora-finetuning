[Verse]
In the city on a Friday night
Headin' to the joint
Everything's a vibe
Checkin' out the menu
Makin' our picks
Papa's pizza party
Gonna get our fix

Got the mozzarella oozin' and the crust so thin
Sizzle in the oven
The smell draws us in
Pepperoni
Mushrooms
And a whole lotta cheese
Papa's pizza party
Bring me to my knees

[Verse 2]
Tables filled with laughter
Kids dancin' on their chairs
The music playing loud
Everybody's got no cares
Slices flyin' in the air
Hands reachin' for a bite
Papa's pizza party
We're livin' it up all night
