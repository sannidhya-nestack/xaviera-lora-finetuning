I Miss you 
Dig you 
Love You
Mean it 
Bye 
Ya Kiss Me 
Diss Me 
Who the hell am I? 
I met you 
Let you 
Now I don't know why 
Miss you 
Dig you 
Love You
Mean it 
Bye Bye Bye

I guess I should have known
You'd break me to the bone 
Slick Talker 
Cock Blocker 
going down stage 5 stalker 
You do what please 
Yo slim shady sleeze 
I won't be chasing 
Just erasing 
Gotta bounce
Time be wasting 

(Instrumental)

Love you Mean it 
Love You Mean it 


I Miss you 
Dig you 
Love You
Mean it 
Bye 
Ya Kiss Me 
Diss Me 
Who the hell am I? 
I met you 
Let you 
Now I don't know why 
Miss you 
Dig you 
Love You
Mean it 
Bye Bye Bye


I'm stronger than you think 
Be gone before you blink 
Straight Shooter 
Love Polluter  
Never be your hotel loser 
You just miss the point
So roll another joint 
You keep trying 
justifying 
Gotta bounce 
I be flying 

(Instrumental)

Love you Mean it 
Love You Mean it 

I Miss you 
Dig you 
Love You
Mean it 
Bye 
Ya Kiss Me 
Diss Me 
Who the hell am I? 
I met you 
Let you 
Now I don't know why 
Miss you 
Dig you 
Love You
Mean it 
Bye Bye Bye
