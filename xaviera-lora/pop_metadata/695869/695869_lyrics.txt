I hear you calling out from the darkness (x3)
I'm coming back from the dead

Verse 1 - A-Lo

I need you but you already know that you're picture perfect, kodak
Every time I'm down and out I think about you and I feel better, prozac
Look girl I don't need a whole lot in this world as long as I got you
Cuz my lungs don't work without you, it's true

Chorus - Skye Holland

I need you to breathe
Bring me back to life
My heart needs ya to beat
Save me from the light, don't let me flatline

Verse 2 - A-Lo

You brought me back to life, Frankenstein
You energize me, I just keep going on and on, Alkaline
I feel untouchable, on top of the world when I got you
My heart don't work without you it's true

Chorus - Skye Holland

I need you to breathe
Bring me back to life
My heart needs ya to beat
Save me from the light, don't let me flatline

Bridge - Skye Holland

I hear you calling out from the darkness 
I'm coming back from the dead (x2)

I need you to breathe (x2)

Chorus - Skye Holland

I need you to breathe
Bring me back to life
My heart needs ya to beat
Save me from the light, don't let me flatline
