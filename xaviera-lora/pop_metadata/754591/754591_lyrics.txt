It's been four lovely hours since we've met.
You caught my eye at the bar and we haven't left yet.
The wine and the beer are speaking for me.
I'm not sure if you got to know me at all.

If you got to know me at all. 4x

When the night is over,
Though it feels like forever,
And we're getting sober,
Will we still be together?
Will we still be together?

She's like maybe we will, let's have one more drink.
Then we'll see what the night will bring.
Next thing I know, XOXO.
Suddenly I see my S.O, S.O.

Did you get to know me at all?

When the night is over,
Though it feels like forever,
And we're getting sober,
Will we still be together?
Will we still be together?
