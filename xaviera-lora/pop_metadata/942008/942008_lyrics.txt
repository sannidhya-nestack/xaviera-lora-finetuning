VERSE
We keep talking at each other
In one ear and out another
Always fail to connect
Spitting out words that hurt me
I know you like fighting dirty                                                       
All your fear and pain I just reflect

PRECHORUS
I know that you’re my poison but I take you anyway
I’m addicted to the ache I get from the things you say
My friends all think I’m crazy for holding on this way
Two dancers in the flames

CHORUS
We’re playing with matches
That’s a bad bad habit
One spark and we ignite
And burn down to ashes
We’re playing with matches
That’s a bad bad habit
One spark and we ignite
And burn down to ashes
Baby, I’m fire…You’re gasoline
Baby, I’m fire…You’re gasoline

VERSE
Why do I find it so enticing
This battlefield so exciting
When every time, the pain is worse
Caught up in this endless warzone
But we can’t leave each other alone
Is this love, or is this just a curse?

PRECHORUS
I know that you’re my poison 
And the venom runs so deep 
I’m addicted to each part of you
Without you I can’t sleep  
I know that this is crazy
But this life I choose to keep  
It’s such a foolish game 

REPEAT CHORUS 

BRIDGE
Oh oh oh oh…Ah ah ah ah…Ah ah ah ah oh…
Oh oh oh oh…Oh oh oh oh…Ah ah ah ah…Ah ah ah ah …Oh!

REPEAT CHORUS
