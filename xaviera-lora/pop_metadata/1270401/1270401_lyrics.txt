[Verse]
In the night so dark and deep
I see you when I sleep
Sparkling like a dream
You're my midnight beam

[Verse 2]
Lost in the crowd we sway
Music takes us away
No words left to say
Dance until light of day

[Chorus]
Guessing your star
So close yet so far
You shine without a scar
Who you are

[Verse 3]
Eyes that never lie
Glance up at the sky
Constellations fly
In your arms I'll try

[Verse 4]
Heartbeat echoing clear
Holding on when you're near
Whisper in my ear
Our wish will appear

[Chorus]
Guessing your star
So close yet so far
You shine without a scar
Who you are
