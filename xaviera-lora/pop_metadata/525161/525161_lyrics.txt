Switch left to right
you keep flippin’
ya change ya mind
ya change ya mind
no can't be that hard
this decision is
black and white
girl make up ya mind
you're the kinda girl
who's always right
day and night
I’m done
sittin' tight
im lookin' for a girl
who doesn't fight
every night
and it's like
you come and go
I'm through with this sideshow
I never know
you walk the line too slow
girl everyday
