We have both gone our separate ways
While everyone around still acts like nothing's changed
you went to the left
I went to the right
At a four way stop we both said goodbye

We, we're too tired to fight
We're too tired to try
We just can't get it right
But, we made it out alive

You me and everyone else
We take it for granted and notice what is left hurt, Pain, and all the in between
It's times like these that make you see all the little things

We, we're too tired to fight
We're too tired to try
We just can't get it right
But, we made it out alive
