“Imaginary You" 
Lyrics: Cal Francis DiFalco 
Music: John Lawrence Schick

We left my little umbrella in that tiny restaurant 
And when it started pouring you were oh so nonchalant 
And later on that evening as we cuddled by the fire 
I couldn’t help but feel oh so utterly inspired 

When we’re holding hands, I'm so free that I can fly 
And when you look at me, with that look in your eyes 
I just can’t help but feel that life is oh so grand 
Oh it feels so good that it’s hard to understand 

Yes it’s magic and it’s tragic yet emphatically true 
I can’t fall out of love with that imaginary you 
And still I know that someday, I’m certain,
We will meet in that Italian restaurant or somewhere on the street 

I love the way you tell me that I can do no wrong 
And how you’re always smiling when I write another song 
And sometimes when I catch you with that alluring little smile 
I dream that I am captured as we’re walking down the aisle 

Yes it’s magic and it’s tragic yet emphatically true 
I can’t fall out of love with that imaginary you 
And still I know that someday, I'm certain
We will meet in that Italian restaurant or somewhere on the street 

I can’t fall out of love with that imaginary you.
