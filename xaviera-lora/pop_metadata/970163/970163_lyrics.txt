I could have given you the best of me
But I guess that I was holding back
Fell in love so young so hopelessly
But you gave me time to deal with that
I guess I"ll never get to know for sure
What would have happened if I let you in and gave you more
But honestly I'm happy that you found her
Maybe you two can get it right
I'm looking at you through her eyes

I can't help but wonder if
She makes you dance to dumb songs like I did
Can't help but wonder if 
She runs her fingers through you hair like I did
Can't help but see you two
With your stupid white picket fence
Your American dream nonsense
Can't help but wonder if 
She fell in love with you like I did

I've had enough time to get over it
But why do I still see you in my dreams
I finally pulled tight and you let go of me
How did we get to lose everything
You didn't have to let it go that far
I don't even know who you are

I can't help but wonder if
She makes you dance to dumb songs like I did
Can't help but wonder if 
She runs her fingers through you hair like I did
Can't help but see you two
With your stupid white picket fence
Your American dream nonsense
Can't help but wonder if 
She fell in love with you like I did

I did yes i did
Fell in love with you yes I did
Bet you'd remember it
Every little moment I did
I did yes I did
I knew this would have happened I did

I can't help but wonder if
She makes you dance to dumb songs like I did
Can't help but wonder if 
She runs her fingers through you hair like I did
Can't help but see the truth
She may love you now
But I did
