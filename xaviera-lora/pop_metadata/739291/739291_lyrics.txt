I know this love is for real
I hope this love is for real
I know this love is for real

I can't stop this feeling, of insecurity
and i need to be close, wherever you will be
'cause living has no meaning, has no aim, when love cannot be found
'cause no-thing really matters. When you are not around
it's like a town without a sound

Can you feel it, i'm your man 3x
Can you feel it, i'm your man 3x

Touch the sky, yes we can
Reach the sky, Oh yes we can
Touch the sky, Yes we can
we'll reach the sky, just you and i
Touch the sky, yes we can
Reach the sky, Oh yes we can
Touch the sky, Yes we can
All you gotta know is, 
I'm your man

I know this love is for real
I hope this love is for real
I know this love is for real

Apologising softly, for whispering your name
Love can be fun but, for sure it's not a game
and all we need is purpose and a reason, for what it's all about
But does, it even matter, when you are not around
Like a town without a sound

I know this love is for real
I hope this love is for real
I know this love is for real

Can you feel it, i'm your man 3x
Can you feel it, i'm your man 3x
Yeah!
