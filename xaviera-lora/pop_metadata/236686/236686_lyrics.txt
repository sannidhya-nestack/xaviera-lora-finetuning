I hate horrible, I love beautiful

And I will let you know, beauty covers from head to toe

It’s shining everywhere you may go

 

Shining in my hair, shining everywhere

Shining in the sky, shining at the birds that fly

Shining from the sun, shining to everyone

But they don’t notice that it’s shining in my hair, shining everywhere

Shining in the sky, it’s shining oh so high

Shining from the sun, it’s shining to everyone

 

Peaking autumn colors and cold white winters into

Blooming spring flowers with rain falling down, now everything has changed

Summer has come, the seasons have gone around

 

Shining in my hair, shinning everywhere

Shining in the sky, shining at the birds that fly

Shining from the sun, shining to everyone

But they don’t notice that it’s shining in my hair, shining everywhere

Shining in the sky, shining oh so high

Shining from the sun, it’s shining to everyone

 

Shining in my hair, shining everywhere

Shining oh so high, shining oh so high

Shining, shining to everyone
