(Verse 1)
Fallen leaves, soft and slow
Whispers in the air, don’t let go
Golden light, fades too soon
I write these words for you

(Chorus)
Autumn poems, quiet and free
Every line, it’s you I see
In the rustling trees, in the cold breeze
You’re the warmth inside of me

(Verse 2)
Raindrops tap the windowpane
I trace your name again and again
The world is calm, in shades of grey
But your love colors my day

(Chorus)
Autumn poems, quiet and free
Every line, it’s you I see
In the rustling trees, in the cold breeze
You’re the warmth inside of me

(Outro)
These words, they fall like autumn rain
Soft and steady, calling your name
