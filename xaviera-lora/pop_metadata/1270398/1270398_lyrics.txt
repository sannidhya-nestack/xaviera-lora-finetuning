[Verse]
Feel the wind it's calling
Whispers through the trees
Nature's voice is falling
Sway with the breeze

[Verse 2]
Sunshine on my shoulder
Birds are flying free
Life feels so much bolder
Sway with the breeze

[Chorus]
Sway sway with the breeze
Let your worries ease
Sway sway with the breeze
Feel the moment freeze

[Verse 3]
Stars come out at nighttime
Moonlight on the seas
Rhythms of a lifetime
Sway with the breeze

[Verse 4]
Memories we're making
Laughter on our knees
Hearts are never breaking
Sway with the breeze

[Chorus]
Sway sway with the breeze
Let your worries ease
Sway sway with the breeze
Feel the moment freeze
