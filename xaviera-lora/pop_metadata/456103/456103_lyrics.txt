That's the spirit

Intro:
Your small brown almond eyes... (Woho) 
Your small brown almond eyes
Your small brown almond you've got everything that I want (Woho) 
Your small brown almond eyes... (Woho) 
Your small brown almond eyes (Woho- Woho) 
Your small brown almond you've got everything that I want 

Verse:
Step over to me boy, 
And grab yourself a drink,
It's not that kind of big thing,
Girl you make me think

Anything goes you say,
At least that's what your eyes tell,
You're so damn good lookin' in your black dress,
You're so damn good lookin' in your black dress, black dress
You're so damn good lookin' in your black dress, (Dadabdadabda)
You're so damn good lookin' in your black dress, black dress

Refrain x2:
(That's the spirit) That is the spirit, (That's the spirit)
We're just moving around turn it upside down feeling free 
(That's the spirit) That is the spirit, (That's the spirit)
There's a new sound in town, lifts you off the ground, yeah yeah..

Step over to me boy, 
And grab yourself a drink,
It's not that kind of big thing,
Girl you make me think

Anything goes you say,
At least that's what your eyes tell,
You're so damn good lookin' in your black dress,
I'm under your spell

You're so damn good lookin' in your black dress,
You're so damn good lookin' in your black dress, black dress

Your small brown almond eyes
Your small brown almond eyes
Your small brown almond you've got everything that I want (Woho) 
Your small brown almond eyes (Woho) 

You're so damn good lookin' in your black dress,
Black dress, black dress, black dress, ….

Your're so damn...
Good lookin' in your black dress,
Black dress, black dress, black dress, …
