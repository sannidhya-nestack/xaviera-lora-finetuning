LITTLE GIRL IN THE BIG WORLD


Another night of despair
I sit and pray for my child somewhere out there

She’s a little girl in the big world
Hope she’s warm and well

I wish she’d write or just call
To ease my mind, it’s so hard when you don’t know

She’s a little girl in the big world
Just a little girl

I know we had our problems for some time
I ignored the warnings, oh so blind
To lose the only real love of mine

A child alone on the streets
I’m so afraid of the stories we all read            

She’s a little girl in the big world
Hope she’s warm and well

I know we had our problems for some time
I ignored the warnings, oh so blind
To lose the only real love of mine

If I close my eyes there’s a way
Not giving up till’ the day she’s back to stay

She’s a little girl in the big world
Hope she’s warm and well
She’s a little girl in a big world
Just a little girl
She’s a little girl in the big world
I hope she’s warm and well
