Such a simple thing
In the open rain
Hand in hand
No need to explain

[Verse 2]
Under clouds so gray
Lighting up the night
Eyes so bright
Our hearts take flight

[Chorus]
Catching raindrops with you
Splashing dreams come true
Lost in our own blue
Just me and you

[Verse 3]
Laughing through the storm
Dancing on our own
Nothing else around
Just the unknown

[Bridge]
Every drop a beat
Every step so sweet
We're endless in the rain
Nothing feels the same

[Chorus]
Catching raindrops with you
Splashing dreams come true
Lost in our own blue
Just me and you
