So you think you will figure it all out
and in time stop running
i'm no man of wisdom
still, here's what I've come to believe
Live for the moment
Nothing will come out of waiting
Seize your existence and believe
it is now in this very moment you are alive
so I see you've got the future all lined up
living life for tomorrow
but time waits for no man
you are what you make out of today
