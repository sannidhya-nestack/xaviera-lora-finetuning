You rule my head you rule my heart
I knew you were right from the start
When you came and said hello
I made my excuses to go
Like a schoolboy running scared
After leaving the love note
I was so unaware

Only you, only you can do that to me
Take me in then make it a tragedy
Shaking up my world
And I just can’t let go      
Only you, only you can play a waiting game
Lead me on, it feels like blasphemy
In another world
You’d be my only girl, only you

You’re cool as ice you made me freeze
I really thought I could believe
Then you dropped in your bombshell
That you were in love with a belle
How could I measure up?
To a girl with size 4 feet
I would never be enough

Only you, only you can do that to me
Take me in then make it a tragedy
Shaking up my world
And I just can’t let go      
Only you, only can act up that way
Lead me on, it feels like blasphemy
In another world
You’d be my only girl, only you

Now I see you in the crowd
And you look so good with her, I don’t feel so down

Only you, only you can do that to me
Take me in then make it a tragedy
Shaking up my world
And I just can’t let go      
Only you, only you can play a waiting game
Lead me on, it feels like blasphemy
In another world
You’d be my only girl
Only you
