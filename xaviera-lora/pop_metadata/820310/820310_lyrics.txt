Tear drops falling on the backstreets a stereo plays solitaire 
Expensive boots on others feet you know the boys on the corner don`t care 
And Debbie takes a walk down Bond Street to buy herself a new dress 
And the kids in the secret places trying hard to clean up the mess 
And the night comes in on the city and the punters roll out like ants 
For those stuck at home such a pity 
For the people on the town come to dance 
They come to dance 

And the light shines bright down main street to a place somewhere out of view 
Behind the bar there`s a secret entrance where secret brothers rendezvous 
And Jackie hires a car for the weekend to feel the warm soft wind in her hair 
And the kids in the secret places fall back tired into the chair 
And the night comes in on Piccadilly from the Kings Road to Sloane Square 
And Suzie says to Johnny don`t be silly there`s nothing going on out there 
They come to dance 
Sidcup Hill, I`d be there still
