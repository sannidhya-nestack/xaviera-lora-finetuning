I miss u              ©2010 Music and lyrics by Stefanie Kammerman

When I’m with u
I watch the clock
Ticking down, knowing that I only got
So little time with u
I miss u
Days, seem like forever
It just doesn’t taste the same
Without u, 
I miss u

It’s just like, mercury’s in retrograde
Doesn’t work it’s not feeling so okay
For a while, we’re just living in the moment
U and I, we get, just a little closer
I, I, I 
Miss u
I, I, I, I, 
Miss u
I, I, I, I, 
I miss u

When I’m with u
We’re stuck together
We’re connected, Krazy glue
Still stuck on you
I kissed u
Hey, can’t smell the flowers 
When your not around today
So far away,
I miss u

It’s just like, mercury’s in retrograde
Doesn’t work it’s not feeling so okay
For a while, we’re just living in the moment
U and I, we get, just a little closer
I, I, I 
Miss u
I, I, I, I, 
Miss u
I, I, I, I, 
I miss u

Reggae

Somehow I don’t know what to say
Anything you want baby that’s ok
Just know I’m around the way
Gonna keep you in my heart girl know that
Still it ain't the same when I’m gone
You know you wondering what’s going on
Can’t say if its right, or its wrong 
Cause I need you with me girl you gotta know that
Cause everything I have going on without you
And everything I have ever did wrong I never meant to
To understand what I mean when I say that I just can’t walk away from this love
Cause I know everything will be fine
Baby girl if we just take time
Right now it’s the way that it is
Im'a say goodbye tonight

Hey, can’t smell the flowers 
When your not around today
So far away,
I miss u

It’s just like, mercury’s in retrograde
Doesn’t work it’s not feeling so okay
For a while, we’re just living in the moment
U and I, we get, just a little closer
I, I, I 
Miss u
I, I, I, I, 
Miss u
I, I, I, I, 
I miss u
