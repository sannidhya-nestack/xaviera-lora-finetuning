Verse 1
Lost and roaming like a stray into the night.
Can’t you see my strength is crumbling?
Shake me until I wake up,
stop me drowning in self doubt.
Take me to a lake of fire
where I can wash you away.

Verse 2
Got to get myself a little anarchy,
a little time away from myself and me.
Your love is battery acid and Evian water,
what happens now to daddy’s little girl?

CHORUS
You’re in my head, churning over what was said.
Don’t I handle this well?
You see through me like water. 
I’m on bad time with everyone.  
As far as I can tell.

Verse 3
Burning mind to a steady beat that aches.
The fields grow bigger but I still stand tall.
Shiver in the shadow of you,
unspoken words choke on the air.
Surrounding me in claustrophobia,
Oh Woah and numbness.
We’re at the stage where you really don’t care
do you?

Chorus

Tell me why,
tell me why.

I can’t please you, can’t please myself.
I can’t please you, can’t please myself.
I can’t please you and I can’t please nobody else.

Nobody else,
nobody else,
nobody else.
