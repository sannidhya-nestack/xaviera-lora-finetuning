You took the light off everyone,
Remember when you swallowed the sun
Oh what a way to waste a day
 
Do you remember when we were young?
Teen spirit was everyone's
Do you remember when we were young?
Teen spirit, it always won
 
Nostalgia is my radio
A winter's war, bereaved by summer sun
Oh what a way to waste a day
Let's waste the days
 
Do you remember when we were young?
Teen spirit was everyone's
 
FEARS FEARS FEARS FEARS
Go tell the wolves that you're here
Go tell them your deepest darkest fears
Tell them your fire is gone
Tell them you're tired they've won
            FEARS
Do you remember when we were young?
Teen spirit was everyone's
Do you remember when we were young?
Teen spirit, it always won
