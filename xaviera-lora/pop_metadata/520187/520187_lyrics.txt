Butterfly
Written by Eric Baines

She wakes to the ocean, from a box beside her bed
She pours herself coffee, takes some pills to clear her head
She tries to remember what she meant to do instead
Of being alone, with the weight of the world
On her shoulders

She dreams that she can fly and knows all the reasons why
With the lessons she’s learned she’ll get by
And she knows she’s breaking soon from the walls of her cocoon
Spread your wings and fly

She packs up her children sends them off to start they’re day
Her greatest creations, these four lives that she has made
A great consolation, for the life she had to trade
All of her plans, sit in a box
On her shelf

She dreams that she can fly and knows all the reasons why
With the lessons she’s learned she’ll get by
And she knows she’s breaking soon from the walls of her cocoon
Spread your wings and fly

Butterfly, Butterfly, Fly

She’s trying on colors, picking wings so she can fly
She’s searching for answers but they’re all inside her mind

She dreams that she can fly and knows all the reasons why
With the lessons she’s learned she’ll get by
And she knows she breaking soon from the walls of her cocoon
Spread your wings and fly
