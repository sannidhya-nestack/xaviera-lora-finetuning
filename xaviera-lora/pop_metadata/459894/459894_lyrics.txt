Chromosomes    


I’ll pick up your chromosomes, one by one
I’ll draw shapes and circles all around
Just to make you them mine, just to make you mine

I’ll play with your DNA any day
I’ll paint in blue and throw some orange in
It’ll be a new day, same as yesterday



Bombs falling on 
The streets of London,
Even though you’re far away, we’re gonna be OK


I’ll float along your bloodstream if you let me in
I’ll love every drop, beg you not to stop
Please don’t look away, for today is the day

I’ll walk along your genes all night long
I’ll make them look fine and pretend it’s alright
We might be washed away, but tonight you should stay


Bridge: 
Do you remember the month of December
The voice in the hall, the sound of the whole scheme of life
And us, hiding.


Trains passing by
Moons dancing high
Even though you’re far away we’re gonna be like
