[Verse]
Colors paint my mind
In shades I never find
Dancing through the night
In bursts of vibrant light

[Verse 2]
Ideas spark and glow
A river starts to flow
Capturing the hues
In everything I do

[Chorus]
Shades of creativity living in my soul
Making something out of nothing
It's the way I roll
Feeling every heartbeat
Letting stories unfold

[Verse 3]
Brush strokes on the page
Breaking from the cage
Letting go of fears
Music in my ears

[Verse 4]
Patterns come alive
In every twist and dive
Creating worlds anew
In red and green and blue

[Chorus]
Shades of creativity living in my soul
Making something out of nothing
It's the way I roll
Feeling every heartbeat
Letting stories unfold
