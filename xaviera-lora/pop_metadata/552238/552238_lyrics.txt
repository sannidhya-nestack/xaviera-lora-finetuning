When I met you
You were not that kind
Self-conceited
Too self-satisfied

We were opposites in every way
In every kind of way
Ain’t it funny how life can change
In a single day

Now here we are baby
Laze about love
When you touch me sweet and softly
I know I’m in luck
And now the rain is falling, 
it’s cold outside, my darling
So won’t you stay here tonight

I was biased
‘bout your kind of men
I even judged you
Before I knew your name

O there was no similarity
In our ways of life
Ain’t it funny that the first sight
Isn’t always right

Now here we are baby
Laze about love
When you touch me sweet and softly
I know I’m in luck
And now the rain is falling, 
it’s cold outside, my darling
So won’t you stay here tonight

It took us so long to see what
Everyone already knew
No matter how different we may seem
I belong to you
Yes I do

Now here we are baby
Laze about love
When you touch me sweet and softly
I know I’m in luck
And now the rain is falling, 
it’s cold outside, my darling
So won’t you stay here tonight
