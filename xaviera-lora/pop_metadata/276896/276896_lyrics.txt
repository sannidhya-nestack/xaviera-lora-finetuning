DEEP BREATH

I tried a million different ways
But I can’t make you stay
I moved the Heavens and the Earth to be with you
But I can’t stop your world, from drifting away
I keep paying the price and counting the cost
Of fighting this war that I’ve already lost

I will take a deep breath
I will close my eyes
And let you walk away, let you walk away
I will take a deep breath
Try not to let my feelings show
I will be strong
I won’t let my feelings show

I spoke a million different words
But I can’t make you hear (you never listen)
I’ve given a hundred and one reasons to you
But the message just gets lost
And all the meaning disappears
I’m hanging up the gloves and throwing this fight
I know that I can’t win, its an aimless plight

CHORUS

I could make a fool of myself time after time
Keep hiding from the fact
It’s the end of the line
Maybe I can change the world
But I couldn’t change your heart
Maybe I should wait for a miracle
But the time would tear me apart
Tear me apart

CHORUS
