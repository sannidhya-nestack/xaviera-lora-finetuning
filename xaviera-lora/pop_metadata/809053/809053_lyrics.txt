I’m under attack, caught up in your fire
It breaks my heart to watch the only thing I believed expire
And you took everything I had
And nothing that you said ever meant a thing
And every vow that you made
Has been abused and betrayed
I’m giving up, I’m giving up

Cause I never could have known
That the good times were on loan
Then you’d make me pay

Will you break me today, deny me my life?
Take away my whole world with just one strike?
With a raise of your hand my will falls apart
You’re breaking me down, down, down
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down. 

I understand it is the only way you know how
If you’d only put your fists down, the healing could begin now
So many times you could have shown
How as a man you have grown, but you turned away

And you’ll break me today, deny me my life
Take away my whole world with just one strike?
With a raise of your hand my will falls apart
You’re breaking me down, down, down
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down. 

This time it’s one too many 
And I’m not going to take this anymore
And although you’ve held me down
It’s time I turn this back around

So I’m making a stand to take back my life
Escaping your world of fear and lies
As they take you away with my blood on your hands
I’ve broken you down, down down
Broken you down.
