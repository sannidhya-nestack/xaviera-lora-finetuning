It's such a simple thing
Yet it's so profound
How the world stands still
Yet it's spinning round
It's such a simple thing
Yet I can't explain
How I feel the sun
Yet I see the rain

In oak-scented rooms
In doorways and halls
They speak of the oceans dividing us all
They say it's harder to change things together
Than do it alone

It's such a simple thing
Yet it stays the same
Could we share our love
Could we share the blame?
It's such a simple thing
Yet it's so profound
How the worls stands still
How it's spinning round

And I'm teaching my children
It's not out of reach
And they help me to practice the things that I preach
For it's harder to change forever
And change them alone

In parks that are closed
Down long country lanes
In scenes by the wayside that constantly change 
The leaves that are falling 
Are starting to cover the ground
Oh, but this isn't Autumn
My heart isn't cold
This isn't the way we're supposed to grow old
And now it seems harder to go back
Wherever we've been

It's such a simple thing 
And yet it's so profound
How my world stands still
And yet it's spinning round.
