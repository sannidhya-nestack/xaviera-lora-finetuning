Otherwise Existence- Suchitra Lata

Just a road, that I see, I want to take
Quite far, it seems, I want to leave
Full of stars, trees, flowers, in which I hide
In the land of my birth

Far away from life that I know
Far away from the noise of the grey city
Far far away, 
otherwise existence

It's a road that I love, where I renew myself
It's a place where I forget who I am
Full of otherwise existence, to get away
For, therre, you can find yourself

Far away from life that I know
Far away from the noise of the grey city
Far far away, 
otherwise existence
