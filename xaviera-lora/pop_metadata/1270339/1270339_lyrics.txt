[Verse]
Morning light so sweet
Dancing in the street
Every heartbeat new
Chasing skies of blue

[Verse 2]
Laughter fills the air
No room for despair
Dreams we’re gonna chase
Find our happy place

[Chorus]
Oh the spice of life
In the day and night
Every moment bright
Oh the spice of life

[Verse 3]
Colors fill the sky
Life it passes by
Holding hands we go
Let the feelings flow

[Bridge]
Take the highs the lows
That's the way it goes
In this dance we find
Magic intertwined

[Chorus]
Oh the spice of life
In the day and night
Every moment bright
Oh the spice of life
