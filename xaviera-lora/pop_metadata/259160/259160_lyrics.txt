My Motor  

I have made up my mind about my life
I'm gonna be a rock star before I die

Oh, no
Please don't try to stop me
A hot V-12 engine ready to hit the street

My motor is running
My motor is running 

Take me to where I want to be
Take me to where I got to be

Sometimes the road is rough and hard
And sometimes you could only move so far 
(You could only move so far) 

But my tank is filled with hopes and dreams
So I keep on rolling 'till I find my capital "P"
('Till I find my capital "P")

My motor is running 
My motor is running

Take me to where I want to be
Take me to where I got to be 

Movin' movin', movin'
Movin', movin', movin'

Do I see the light 
Do I see the light

My motor is running
My motor is running 

Take me to where I want to be
Take me to where I got to be
(Where I got to be, yeah, yeah)

My motor is running
(Uh, huh, yeah, yeah)
My motor is running
(Uh, huh, yeah, yeah) 
It's gonna take me to where I want to be
(It's gonna take me, yeah, it's gonna take me)
It's gonna take me to where I got to be
