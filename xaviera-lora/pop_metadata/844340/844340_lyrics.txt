it's so hard sometimes
to glue us together
you crack, fall apart
depending on the weather

so don't touch
i'd like it too much

it's so cold at night
by myself when we fight
I toss and I turn
restless for salvation

i'm goin' crazy
anticipatin'  
hatin' waitin'
for your call again

don't touch- i'd like it too much
please stop- you're far too much
to take- i'm on my knees
you're nothin' but trouble

 it's so hard to say no
to move on to let go
and stick to my guns
one touch I come undone

the sky is fallin'
the earth shakin'
I just can't seem to
get you off my mind

seein' is believin'
words are deceivin'
trustin' you ain't easy
cause your sayin' this
doin' that

don't touch- i'd like it too much
please stop- you're far too much
to take- i'm on my knees
you're nothin' but trouble




seein' is beleivin'
words are deceivin'
lovin' you ain't easy
cause your playin' games
all the time

don't touch
please stop
don't touch
please stop

don't touch- i'd like it too much
please stop- you're far too much
to take- i'm on my knees
you're nothin' but trouble

don't touch- i'd like it too much
please stop- you're far too much
to take- i'm on my knees
you're nothin' but trouble

i'm a horny devil
i'm a horny devil
and you're nothin' but trouble
