V1
DAY AFTER DAY… I DREAM ABOUT YOU. I GET LOST IN THE CLOUDS
AND I MELT WHEN YOU MOVE.
WHEN I THINK ABOUT YOU MY BREATH STARTS TO RACE
AND A RAINBOW OF COLORS DANCE ON MY FACE.

PC
BUT NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY; I CAN’T GET YOU TO CATCH MY EYES.

CHORUS
AM I INVISIBLE?   JUST LIKE THE AIR?
A BREATH ON THE WINDOW, THAT SOON DISAPPEARS?
MY HEART SILENTLY STOPS, CUZ I’D GIVE UP ALL THAT I’VE GOT
FOR YOUR LOVE.    AM I INVISIBLE?

V2
YOU FLOAT NEXT TO ME LIKE A RIVER OF WIND,
AND I AM FROZEN BY THE WARMTH OF YOUR SKIN
BUT YOU LOOK THROUGH ME LIKE I AM A GHOST,
JUST PART OF THE SCENE THAT YOU DON’T NOTICE

PC
CUZ   MY SMILE DOESN’T GET YOU TO STAY I CAN’ T GET YOU TO LOOK MY WAY.

CHORUS

BRIDGE

THEN ONE DAY BY CHANCE WE ARE BOTH EYE TO EYE,
YOU START TO SMILE AND I START TO FLY,
BUT MY TEARS FALL WHEN I SEE YOUR NOT SMILING AT ME…


MY HEART SILENTLY STOPS, CUZ I’D GIVE UP ALL THAT I’VE GOT, FOR YOUR LOVE!

CHORUS
AM I INVISIBLE, NOTHING BUT AIR.
A BREATH ON THE WINDOW, THAT JUST DISAPPEARS
MY HEART SILENTLY STOPS,
CUZ I’D GIVE UP ALL THAT I’VE GOT. BUT I AM INVISIBLE
