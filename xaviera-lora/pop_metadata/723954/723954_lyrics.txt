I see you here
See you there
Everywhere

Lost in your eyes
Feel your sighs
In the night

Oh, stranger won’t you play?
Oh, baby all the way

(chorus)
When you’re gone
I am weak
Feeling high
When you speak
Stranger won’t you play with me
You’re so hot
Can’t you tell
That I’m under your spell
Stranger won’t you play with me
Play with me

You in my head
In my bed
Don’t forget

More, give me more
Don’t you hide
In the night

Oh, stranger won’t you play?
Oh, baby all the way

(chorus)
When you’re gone
I am weak
Feeling high
When you speak
Stranger won’t you play with me
You’re so hot
Can’t you tell
That I’m under your spell
Stranger won’t you play with me

Stranger
Danger
Whenever you’re in
Whenever you’re out
Feel me
Heal me now

Out in the cold
When you go
Don’t go

(chorus)
When you’re gone
I am weak
Feeling high
When you speak
Stranger won’t you play with me
You’re so hot
Can’t you tell
That I’m under your spell
Stranger won’t you play with me

When you’re gone
I am weak
Feeling high
When you speak
Stranger won’t you play with me
You’re so hot
Can’t you tell
That I’m under your spell
Stranger won’t you play with me
Play with me
