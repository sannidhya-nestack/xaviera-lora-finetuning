Don’t Sugarcoat It
by Lori Kelley/Jeremy Michael

When ever you call me
I don’t really know what
Kind of a story you’ll be laying down

Are you gonna save me
Forever damn me
How can you stand there watching me drown

Pre Chorus
Ya got me boy
But you don’t get to keep me guessing, no 

Chorus
Sugar, don’t sugarcoat it
I just wanna know if
Ya gonna let me down
Ya gonna let me down
Cruelly or easy does it
I just wanna know if
Ya gonna let me down
Sugar, don’t sugarcoat it

How can I reach you
When I never touch you
Taking the journey into your soul

What can I give you
When you don’t show me the cards 
In your hand ‘cause you always fold

Ya got me boy
But you don’t get to keep me guessing, no 

Chorus
Sugar, don’t sugarcoat it
I just wanna know if
Ya gonna let me down
Ya gonna let me down
Cruelly or easy does it
I just wanna know if
Ya gonna let me down
Sugar, don’t sugarcoat it

Bridge
Words dripping with honey
Don’t mean a thing
I want ya to get to the sting
