WINTER BLUE
©2010 Littlewood, Corrigan


Need to fly away get out of this city
Gotta find me in a place where the sun shines on me
Girl’s bronzing the sands, maybe someone in my hands
I should be there

I’m winter blue
The grey and the wind cuts through
And I need something new
The cold and the rain can’t use
I’m down on my self
Guess I’ve got the real winter blues

High above the sky the jets fly by me
All it takes to be up there is just some money
Girl’s bronzing the sands, maybe someone in my hands
Far away there

I’m winter blue
The grey and the wind cuts through
And I need something new
The cold and the rain can’t use
I’m down on my self
Guess I got the real winter blues

Know the streets as far as means will take me
Somewhere far away the sun can find me

Girl’s bronzing the sands, no more winter on my hands
I should be there

I’m winter blue
The grey and the wind cuts through
And I need something new
The cold and the rain can’t use

Oh I’m winter blue
The grey and the wind cuts through
And I need something new
The cold and the rain can’t use
I’m down on my self
Guess I got the real winter blues
I need somewhere else, got only this feeling to lose
I’m down on my self
Guess I got the real winter blues
