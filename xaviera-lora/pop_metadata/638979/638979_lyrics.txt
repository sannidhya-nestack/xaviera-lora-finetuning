BOURBON STREET

Taking a ride down Bourbon Street
Crowds pushin’ and shovin’
In the city heat
There’s a sense of excitement
Watch it come alive
In Technicolor neon
An explosion of light

Dixieland, blues, Creole rhythm fills the air
Sights and the sounds you just won’t find anywhere
Doors open wide, anything your heart desires
Bars and the strip clubs, where temptation lights the fire

The fun never stops on Bourbon Street   
Beer at 4 dollars
Flowing like a stream
Hurricane cocktail
Pat O’Briens, feel the mood     
Down from Canal Street, Esplanade Avenue

Dixieland, blues, Creole rhythm fills the air
Sights and the sounds you just won’t find anywhere
Doors open wide in the heart of New Orleans
Coming alive down Bourbon Street

Dixieland, blues, Creole rhythm fills the air
