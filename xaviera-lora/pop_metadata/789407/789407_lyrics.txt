Long time in this elder land
Those liers everywhere
Great voice and stupid minds
In famous lullabies
The land that has no mountains

Big river don’t denny
Your blessed  touch of life
Lead all your sons to hell
This is your cursed spell
The land that has no mountains
Raise her voice to you

Uh uh uh uh
Tonight
Tonight
Say hello to my sky
Tonight
Tonight


It’s been a long time in the bottom  of big river town of mine 
Say you can never never never never leave the smell behind
I never wanna say 
To anyone
I just have to prove to me
That something happens with this piece of land and those who were born at the sea

The land that has no mountains
Raise her voice to you

Uh...
Tonight
Tonight
Say hello to my sky
Tonight
Tonight

SOLO

The land that has no mountains
Raise her voice to you

Uh..
Tonight
Tonight
Say hello to my sky
Tonight
Tonight
Say hello to my sky
Tonight
tonight
