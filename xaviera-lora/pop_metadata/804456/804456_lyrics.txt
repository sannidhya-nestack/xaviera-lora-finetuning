Yes you talk the talk, 
But you don't really walk the walk. 
In this world full of fakes, 
You fit right in. 
Lifes been maybe not so well 
But you are lazy but oh well. 

You know you have something, 
coming your way. 
One day I will stand up to you. 
And have Revenge. 
Revenge. 
All I really want, 
Is my revenge, 
Revenge 
All I really want 
Is my revenge. 

Yes you speak the words
but you really mean them.
Walk on egg shells around you
Because you're moody too. 
Lifes been maybe hard on you
But you've got one person to blame
And that's you. 

You know you have something, 
coming your way. 
One day I will stand up to you. 
And have Revenge. 
Revenge. 
All I really want, 
Is my revenge, 
Revenge 
All I really want 

Its not that I'm saying that 
You could-a, would-a, should-a
It's not that I'm saying you're 
this top notch guy. 
It's not that I'm saying 
that you never lied to me, 
you did. 
Revenge 

You know you have something, 
coming your way. 
One day I will stand up to you. 
And have Revenge. 
Revenge. 
All I really want, 
Is my revenge, 
Revenge 
All I really want 

I'm gonna be stupid, 
I'm gonna be mean. 
I'm gonna be everything 
In between. 
I'm gonna say "no really"
I'm gonna sing loud and be proud 
Revenge. 
I'm gonna be everything 
that you didn't want for me. 

Revenge, Revenge, Revenge…..
