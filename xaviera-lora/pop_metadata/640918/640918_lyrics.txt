I walked outside today
the rain was freezing cold
the sky was dark
and the clouds were heavy
I picked up a leaf
A single golden leaf
With coral running through
heres the beauty 
that life provides
heres the wonder
that life provides
I held my baby today
his body was so warm
his pale grey eyes
well there just like his fathers
He reached out his hand
reached for my love
my heart just overflowed
heres the beauty
that life provides
heres the wonder
that life provides
I prayed for healing today
my friends been fading away
i send her light 
and i just kept sending
she called me on the phone
the sound of her voice
stronger than before
Heres the beauty
that life provides
heres the wonder
that life provides
Heres the beauty
Heres the wonder
I can feel the compassion
and I know theres a power life provides
Oh life provides
