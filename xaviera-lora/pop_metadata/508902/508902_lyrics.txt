This is the ending no one thinks about
I hope this letter lets me sort it out while there’s still time
I might be gone but you’re still here – blue eyes, gold hair and no fear
Don’t you let the fire burn out in your heart

Now you go girl, you go girl
Live long and marry right
May you be strong – move on - love with all your might
And I owe you, I owe you
For every smile, every tear, every moment you were near
Love again but please don’t take his hand and watch the sun set on Oak Island

Everyone said they’ll keep an eye on you
Whether or not you really want them to – they've got your back
Remember long drives to the beach in the wintertime – 
love as pure as the Carolina sunshine
Wrapping my arms around you as we sat on the sand
My sun will set before long
I know you’ll struggle to hold on
Darkness will give way to a new dawn

Now you go girl, you go girl
Live long and marry right
May you be strong – move on - love with all your might
And I owe you, I owe you
For every smile, every tear, every moment you were near
Love again but please don’t take his hand and watch the sun set on Oak Island

Take this letter once you've read it and light a match
You'll be running blind if you're always looking back
Take this letter once you've read it and light a match

And go girl, just go girl
Live long and marry right
May you be strong – move on - and live a brilliant life
And I owe you, I owe you
For every smile, every tear, every whisper in my ear
Love again but please don’t take his hand and watch the sun set on Oak Island
