Woo hoo! the pleasures of a conversation
That I ain't trying to have
I am running to the nearest place that's far from you
I have heard it all from you
I got enough to last

It would make me happy 
To see you save it for me
Sometimes I want to be known
Sometimes I need to be lone

And I will tell you to save it for me
And I will say this sarcastically 

Save me some of that what you have for me 
I'll be there I promise I promise
Save it for me why don't you
Leave what you got at the table
I'll pick it up later

Rushing through obstacles dodging poles
Sometimes people feed me lines I can't digest
So I will just say in jest
Save me some of that what you got
I'l get on top of it once you stop a bit
Stressing lying trying tying me up there
I don't think that you're aware

Watch me jump to my feet 
I see you heading for me
You've got a story to tell
You're much too close I can smell

So I will tell you to save it for me
And I will say this sarcastically 

(Yeah yeah sure sure I want to hear all of that and much more)

If you watch me stay here and listen
Watch me glisten my eyes will glaze over
While you talk days over
This loud ass music
You realize I'm on my way
Somewhere else away from you

Ooo Yeah yeah sure sure I want to hear all of that and much much more

Save me some of that what you have for me 
I'll be there I promise I promise
Save it for me why don't you
Leave what you got at the table
I'll pick it up later

But really though it's silly though
I don't know why I feel it so
I just do

Save me some of that what you have for me 

I'll be there I promise I promise
Save it for me why don't you
Leave what you got at the table
I'll pick it up later

Save me some of that what you have for me (x3)
