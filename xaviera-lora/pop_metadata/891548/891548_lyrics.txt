A DVD of Pinnochio, 
a green T-shirt from Tokyo. 
Two of many souvenirs, 
I got from you through several years. 

The TV from our living room, 
a scarf with some remains of your perfume. 
A picture where I used to see, 
the future of a family. 

But somehow, somehow
things didn't work out the way it should. 
Somehow, somehow, 
this is all I´ve got. 
They say that I should throw you away, 
cause this is where it stops. 
But I am putting you away now in a Cardboard Box. 

The most important thing I´ll take. 
Is knowledge that may one day cure this ace. 
Though you will never give me something new, 
I did enjoy being good to you.

Though things will never be the same, 
I keep a little box with your name.
