Fearsome night and the moon is full,
The wolf howls from the clifftop shores,
Wind is silent bitter still,
Grass is cold with icy claws,
And the mist, the mist rolls in.

Ancient times are beating strong,
Natures blood like ocean waves,
Souls not lost but have past on,
Footprints in the sand we pave,
And the mist, the mist rolls in.

Powerful mist you are clouded in mystery,
Dancing in swirls you are hiding identity,
Blanket worlds like the cloak of the angels,
Take me away to the land where the mists are from.
