Who knows why the magnet brought me here
All the lights turned up green and the skies became all clear
All I see are smiling faces everywhere
And the sound of the crowd puts a beautiful buzz in the air
Today we may have been wound up too tight
but all that gets unraveled tonight
tonight

Oh this is the night our spirits get set free
Oh this feels so right and I believe
Oh this is the night our spirits get set free
Oh this feels so right and I believe
This will be THE GREATEST NIGHT IN HISTORY
This will be THE GREATEST NIGHT IN HISTORY

So lets adjust our altitudes and lift our glasses to the moon it's time to steal the show
This isn't just another night lets raise the bar until we're far up in the ozone
We're riding this night like there might be no tomorrow
And nothing can put the brakes on us tonight
tonight

Oh this is the night our spirits get set free
Oh this feels so right and I believe
Oh this is the night our spirits get set free
Oh this feels so right and I believe
This will be THE GREATEST NIGHT IN HISTORY
This will be THE GREATEST NIGHT IN HISTORY
This will be THE GREATEST NIGHT IN HISTORY
(Let's lift our glasses high, living like there's no tomorrow night)
This will be THE GREATEST NIGHT IN HISTORY
(Let's set our spirits free, up up up up up into the ozone tonight)
This will be THE GREATEST NIGHT IN HISTORY
(Let's lift our glasses high, living like there's no tomorrow night)
This will be THE GREATEST NIGHT IN HISTORY
(Let's set our spirits free, up up up up up into the ozone tonight)
