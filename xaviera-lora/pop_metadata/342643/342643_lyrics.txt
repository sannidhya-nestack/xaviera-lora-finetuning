Guess I've finally bottomed out
There's nowhere left to run
Kinda feels like staring down
The barrel of a loaded gun

No more second chances
My horizons getting bleak
My bridges are in ashes and
My inner strength is weak

I believe in something
But I don't know what it is
Never much on miracles
But I never needed one like this

The only life I'll ever live
Has been more take than it's been give
As the thread I'm hanging by
Unravels right before my eyes

I cry
I cry
I cry
I cry

Walking straight off of a cliff
Every single day
Just assume it's a mistake
If it ever goes my way

Haunted by this running joke
That I call my life
Knowing just what I've become
Cuts me like a knife

I believe in something
But I don't know what it is
Never much on miracles
But I never needed one like this

The only life I'll ever live
Has been more take than it's been give
As the thread I'm hanging by
Unravels right before my eyes
