Dream your dream tonight, let the colours fly
Hang on to your love untill morning light
Live your fantasy, your very own
A vision to ignite this new breaking dawn
Racing through your sole, sweet galaxy
a miracle of thoughts and discovery
Lift your heart and mind, and watch it grow
yes you can achieve, the unachievable
All you need: Illumination
All you need: is Elevation
All you need: is Destination
All you need: is Celebration
All you need: Imagination
"uhuhuh.. all need is imagination"
