verse 1:
What I crave is a guiding force
Someone keeping my dreams on course
And going the distance like a champion racehorse
Silently bra-a-ave 

verse 2:
What I crave is a selfmade man 
Who is not afraid to dirty his hands
And who was born to please  the woman I am
At the end of a long long day 

chorus:
That's what I cra-a-a-a-ave yeah what I crave what I crave
That's what I cra-a-a-a-ave every day every day

bridge section:
I seek devotion as deep as the ocean
As wide as the universe
Yes I'm waiting with arms wide open
¬For someone to end my search

verse3:
What I crave is a heavenly place
Together we'll soar through time and space 
With a bond so strong no one can erase
Our emotional tidal wave whoa oh oh oh
