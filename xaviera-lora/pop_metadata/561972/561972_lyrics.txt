Differences

Verse:
Finds comfort in another glass of wine
Closes her eyes and dreams away
With clouded mind she spends some time
It's all the same as yesterday

Chorus:
Over now well it's over now
Differences separate our ways
Over now it's all over now
Differences seems far away today

Verse:
Sleeps tight at day while he's away
She dreams she's falling once again
Regrets the words she had to say
Can't figure out what's wrong with men

Chorus:
Over now well it's over now
Differences separate our ways
Over now it's all over now
Differences seems far away today 

Bridge:
Why else would we end it?

Chorus:
Over now well it's over now
Differences separate our ways
Over now it's all over now
Differences seems far away today
