Building an empire on the sun
Personal palace from everyone
No doors to keep you from returning
Your footsteps are the path I take

I stood here once before I found you
The center of another day

Watching the earth revolve around me
Static trance and drifting slow
A memory of my only lover
No equilibrium, no control

I stood here once before I found you
The center of another day

Building an empire on the sun
Personal palace from everyone

I stood here once before I found you
The center of another day
The sacrament that sends me flying
My empire on the sun away
