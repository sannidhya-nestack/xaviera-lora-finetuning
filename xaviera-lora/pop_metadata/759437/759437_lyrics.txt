The town in evening,
 Lights are launched...
The smells like from
 A cutted grass...
I'm running from place which curses watched
But diving in the life to pass.


Night. The moonlight trembles in the water,
I'm searching for luck many of moon years!
The extremely brightened fires of slaughter
In water that cannot make me dry from tears.


I want to discover,
 Where river streams,
Who follows it in 
A cool blue,
I want to discover, where are star beams
Who will discover secret view?
