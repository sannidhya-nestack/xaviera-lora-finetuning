VERSE 1
LA DA DA 
I GOT, DIRTY CLOTHES, ON THE FLOOR. A KIT CAT CLOCK HANGS ON MY WALL
SOMETIMES MY HAIR IS RED, OR STYLED IN DREADS
I LIKE TO WEAR SNEAKERS WITH MY SUNDAY BEST. 
PC
YOU MAY TEASE ME WHEN I SING OFF KEY
AND WHEN I’M DANCING TO A HIP HOP BEAT
THAT DON’T BOTHER ME CUZ 
CHORUS 1
THAT’S JUST WHO I AM! WHAT YOU SEE, IS WHAT YOU GET
THAT’S JUST WHO I AM! I KNOW I’M CRAZY; CAN’T CHANGE ME BABY  
I’M NOBODY ELSE BUT ME…JUST WHO I AM.
LA DA DA, DA DA DA
V2
I’M NOT A GOURMET CHEF, I MUST CONFESS
I LIKE CHEESY CHIPS ON MY TUNA FISH 
I GOT A NEW TATTOO, SAYS, “I LOVE ME TOO”
AND I ALWAYS FEEL HAPPY WHEN I HEAR THE BLUES
PC2
YOU ROLL YOUR EYES WHEN I MAKE FUNNY FACES
AND WHEN I SKIP AROUND IN PUBLIC PLACES
THAT DON’T BOTHER ME CUZ
 CHORUS
BRIDGE
I DON’T TRY FOR PERFECTION. NOT AFRAID OF YOUR REJECTION
YOUR WORDS WON’T GET IT MY WAY! OH OH CUZ
LAST CHORUS
THAT’S JUST WHO I AM
WHAT YOU SEE, IS WHAT YOU GET
THAT’S JUST WHO I AM
 I KNOW I’M CRAZY; CAN’T CHANGE ME BABY
I’M NOBODY ELSE BUT ME I’LL BE NOBODY ELSE BUT JUST WHO I AM!
