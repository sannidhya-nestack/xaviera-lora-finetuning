PARTY PEOPLE


Like a ticking bomb
Ready to explode
Need to take a chill                                                        
Let the pressure go                             

Like a sheet of glass
Far from shatterproof
Don’t wanna see you break
Lose the attitude

Can’t deny, can’t deny
You’re stepping closer to the heat
Can’t deny, can’t deny
You should be moving next to me                   

Hands up in the air
Come and join the party people
Feel it disappear
When you’re with the party people

Watch the tension leave                     
When the beat arrives
Emotional release
Rollercoaster ride

Now the party rocks
Bassline hits the floor
Like a shooting star
You’re brighter than before   

Can’t deny, can’t deny
You’re finally moving from the edge
Can’t deny, can’t deny
This feeling going through your head

Hands up in the air
Come and join the party people
Feel it disappear
When you’re with the party people
Hands up in the air
Come and join the party people
Feel it disappear
When you’re with the party people

Hands up in the air
Come and join the party people
Feel it disappear
When you’re with the party people
Hands up in the air
Come and join the party people
Feel it disappear
When you’re with the party people


Yeah eh
Join the party and everything’s alright
Yeah eh
Join the party and everything’s alright
(Hands up in the air)
Yeah eh
Join the party and everything’s alright
(Hands up in the air)
Yeah eh
Join the party and everything’s alright
