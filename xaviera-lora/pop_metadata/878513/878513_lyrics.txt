That's life

A young boy learns quick how to make things go his way,
learns all about them and the things they say,
becomes a man and his heart turns cold, but that's just the beginning... 
He grows obsessed with the things he has and hasnt had
and the line blurrs between happy and sad,
he takes a pill to change his will and numb his head.  Is there anyone winning?
   That 's life thats the way it goes, it moves so fast sometimes I know
Just like the movies filled with highs and lows, sit back enjoy the show
ahh ahh
A young girl dreams and prays for things to get better,
she wants to see the world but her mom wont let her,
moms afraid she'll lose her innocent heart, but the world is waiting...
this magic age the world is still full of wonder and
nothing can break the spell she's under, 
so she packs her bags and leaves her mom in tears, worried and waiting...
    that's life just one big mystery, it burns in you and it burns in me
just like the old man said before he died, sit back enjoy the ride...
ahh ahh ahh
Seems like there's too much to care about,
seems like there's too much to fight about,
and just when you think you've got it all figured out, that's when everything changes
   That's life that's the way it goes, it moves so fast sometimes I know,
just like the movies filled with highs and lows, sit back enjoy the show....
