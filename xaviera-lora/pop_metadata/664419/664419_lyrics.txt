I'm not a toy that you can break
I'm not a toy that you can shake
I'm not a toy, i'm not a toy

I'm not a man that you can call
I'm not a man, no not at all
I'm not a man, i'm not a man

I'm just a boy who hates to wake
I'm just a boy who loves to shake
I'm just a boy, i'm just a boy

Your just a girl who loves to fuck
Your just a girl i wanna pluck
Your just a girl, your just a girl

I'm just a boy, your just a girl
We're just two lovers in a world
It's just love, it's just love

love, love, love

I'm not a killer on the run
I'm not up for a lot of fun
I'm not the man of your dreams

I'm not a thief on the loose
I'm not the guy you wanna shoot
I'm just a boy, i'm just a boy

I won't save you in the night
I'll run away when there's a fight
I'm just a boy, i'm just a boy

Cos there's a lot of things i'm not
Oh maybe baby you forgot
To look at me and not your mind
