Sittin here, doing fine, playing my music all the time.
The sun is shining almost every day, but I'm too scared to walk your way.
My head is bobbing, my heart is throbbing, I don't know if I can take this anymnore.
I want to look into your eyes, feel time slip and slide, I want to hold your hand and let you know I'm your man..
(chorus)
Ba bo ba ba de ba da bo do,...
I just want to spend some time with you, have you listen to my rhyme.
I want to do the little things that make you smile all the time, feel so free now baby, I want to make you mine.
want to, need to, spend some time with you
want to, need to, spend some time with you
(chorus)
Ba ba.....
talking bout you, talking bout me,
in the sunshine, yeah..
I know that I can make you so happy
and I know that you make me so free
There's no hurry,
I don't want you to worry.
I'll be right here, all the time..
want to, need to, spend some time with you
want to, need to, spend some time with you..
(chorus)
Ba ba da bo....
