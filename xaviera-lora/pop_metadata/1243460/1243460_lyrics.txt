[Verse]
Running wild
Can't slow down
Every day feels like a battleground
Clock keeps ticking
Gotta keep moving
No time to rest
No time for losing

[Verse 2]
Phone keeps ringing
Messages explode
Too many demands
Too much to decode
Meetings and deadlines
They never end
Drowning in a to-do list that won't bend

[Chorus]
Busy
Busy as a bee
Buzzing 'round so tirelessly
Got no time to unwind
Gotta keep the grind
But sometimes I just need to find
Some peace of mind

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Running wild
Can't slow down
Every day feels like a battleground
Clock keeps ticking
Gotta keep moving
No time to rest
No time for losing
