I’D GIVE ANYTHING
SOONER OR LATER I GOTTA GO HOME
AND SLEEP IN OUR OLD PLACE ALL ALONE
I TRASHED EVERY PICTURE THAT YOU LEFT BEHIND
BUT YOU CLING LIKE A GHOST IN THE CORNER OF MY EYE
WANNA SCRAPE YOU OFF MY SKIN
BURN THE MEMORY OF YOUR KISS
Chorus   I’D GIVE ANYTHING FOR YOU TO LOVE ME
BUT YOU DON’T
I’D GIVE ANYTHING FOR YOU TO COME BACK
BUT YOU WON’T
WISH I COULD LET YOU GO
I MET A GIRL AND SHE HAD IT ALL
ANYONE ELSE WOULD’VE COME ON REAL STRONG
HARD AS I TRIED I COULD NOT CATCH THE MOOD
CAUSE SHE’S JUST A GIRL AND SHE ISN’T YOU
I WANNA SCRAPE YOU OFF MY SKIN
BUT THE WOUND GOES FURTHER IN
Chorus     I’D GIVE ANYTHING FOR YOU TO LOVE ME
BUT YOU DON’T
I’D GIVE ANYTHING FOR YOU TO COME BACK
BUT YOU WON’T
WISH I COULD LET YOU GO
bridge
WITH SOME TIME AND WITH SPACE
I’LL FORGET, FORGET YOUR FACE
SO I’VE HEARD, SO THEY SAY
Chorus
I’D GIVE ANYTHING FOR YOU TO LOVE ME
BUT YOU DON’T
I’D GIVE ANYTHING FOR YOU TO COME BACK
BUT YOU WON’T
WISH I COULD LET YOU, SO HARD TO LET YOU GO
