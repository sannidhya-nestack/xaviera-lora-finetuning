[Verse]
Bright lights shining everywhere
We were on a dare
Meeting eyes without a care
Feeling love
Fair and square

[Verse 2]
Running through the city streets
Dancing to the beats
Hand in hand our hearts compete
Life and love
Fair and square

[Chorus]
Fair and square
You and me
As wild as we can be
Fair and square
Can’t you see
We're bound eternally

[Verse 3]
Underneath the starry sky
Dreams soar up so high
Holding tight and never shy
You and I
Fair and square

[Bridge]
Every moment feels so right
In the day and night
No regrets
No need to fight
In this glow
Fair and square

[Chorus]
Fair and square
You and me
As wild as we can be
Fair and square
Can’t you see
We're bound eternally
