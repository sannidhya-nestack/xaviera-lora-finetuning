It's just another night
Wanna go for a ride
Only I can do it right for you

You wanna come inside
Don't make this harder
You gotta give me more

I don't wanna be
Your one night lady
I heard you been around
So tell me

Who loving you now
Who loving you now
Tell me baby where you've been lately
Who loving you now
Who loving you now
Tell me baby where you've been lately

Didn't mean to get so deep
Guess I don't
Really know me

You know I feel your heat
Right next to me
It just gets to me

You're all I'm looking for
You're all I'm looking for

Who loving you now
Who loving you now
Tell me baby where you've been lately
Who loving you now
Who loving you now
Tell me baby where you've been lately
