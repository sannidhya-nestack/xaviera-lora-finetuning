Win The Fight

Verse 1

If it’s needed to be then I’ll be wrong
Cuz all these words and all these songs
Don’t mean a damn thing if I don’t get to be with you
Cuz baby you’re mine and I can’t stand the thought of you
Being someone elses man, won’t give up on us

Pre Chorus

I, I just wanna see your smile
I just wanna touch the sky
I just want us to fly
And I, I don’t wanna ever go
Go away far from you, no-no

Chorus

I don’t care if you’re wrong
Doesn’t matter who’s right
Cuz I’ll be damned if I lose you
I need you in my life
I’d rather be wrong
Than alone and be right
And as long as you’re happy 
I’ll let you win the fight

Verse 2

If it’s real to me then this is love
I could feel the beat in every song
Doesn’t matter at all if I don’t get to be with you
Cuz baby your eyes they shine like a star to me
Leading me to your heart

Pre Chorus

I, I just wanna see your smile
I just wanna touch the sky
I just want us to fly
And I, I don’t wanna ever go
Go away far from you, no-no

Chorus

I don’t care if you’re wrong
Doesn’t matter who’s right
Cuz I’ll be damned if I lose you
I need you in my life
I’d rather be wrong
Than alone and be right
And as long as you’re happy 
I’ll let you win the fight

Bridge

I don’t care if you’re wrong
Doesn’t matter who’s right
Cuz I’ll be damned if I lose you
I need you in my life
I’d rather be wrong
Than alone and be right
And as long as you’re happy 
I’ll let you win the fight (x2)

Chorus

I don’t care if you’re wrong
Doesn’t matter who’s right
Cuz I’ll be damned if I lose you
I need you in my life
I’d rather be wrong
Than alone and be right
And as long as you’re happy 
I’ll let you win the fight
