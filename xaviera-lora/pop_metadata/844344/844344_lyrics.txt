if you keep waitin'
for the other shoe to drop
you gonna keep getting'
what you got
if you keep spinnin'
round and round
you're never gonna really
touch the ground 

no one knows about tomorrow
no one knows what it will bring

I know it gets hard
sometimes I know it ain't easy
you get knocked down
to the ground bruised and dirty
get on up
shake it off, move on, believe me
it ain't perfect
but you're worth it

if you keep runnin'
all the time
you're never gonna see the signs
if you keep forcin' everything
you're never gonna let
loves roots dig in

no one knows about tomorrow
no one knows what it will bring

I know it gets hard
sometimes I know it ain't easy
you get knocked down
to the ground bruised and dirty
get on up
shake it off, move on, believe me
it ain't perfect
but you're worth it

it's not perfect, but ain't it worth it
i'm not perfect, but ain't it worth it
you're not perfect, but ain't it worth it
we're not perfect, but ain't it worth it

this love is perfect
