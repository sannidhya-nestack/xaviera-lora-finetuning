INVINCIBLE 
Ani Neradilkova/Cliff Turner
Cracked lips in dry winter winds
I lived with chills  in my heart
Patched up by safety pins
Im So glad that’s now in the past

CH
When I’m next to you 
I'm invincible
When I’m next to you 
I'm invincible

V2
We kiss like eskimos
I feel your breath on my neck
Night sky glows indigo
We watch the moon as it sets
When I’m next to you
I'm invincible
When I’m next to you, I'm invincible

Chorus
A late September afternoon
I saw you walking to the early rising moon 
You’re clothes were styled by the wind 
I watched you watch me soak you in 
Now I can  do anything
We kiss Like Eskimos, we kiss like Eskimos
