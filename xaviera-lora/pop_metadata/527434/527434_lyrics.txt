words freeze
as they leave my lips
still my heart beats
in my fingertips

cause when the cold collides
with the blaze inside
i don't hide
i feel alive

I hi hi hi
love to lose myself in life
cause it feels all right
and I hi hi hi
don't need no savior
to unwind
cause i feel aligned
and i hi hi hi
i'm drowning deeper
and I hi hi
would die to feel
alive

if my mind's deceit
my heart won't drift
And if i face defeat
i embrace it as a gift

cause when the world collides
with the pain inside
i don't hide
i feel alive

I hi hi hi
gonna dig in deeper into life
it's all right
and I hi hi hi
don't need no savior
to unwind
cause i feel aligned
and i hi hi hi
i'm drowning deeper
and I hi hi
would die to feel
alive

Love to lose myself
Makes me feel all right
Don’t need no savior now
Drowning deeper

and i hi hi hi
i'm drowning deeper
and I hi hi
would die to feel
alive

I hi hi hi
gonna dig in deeper into life
it's all right
and I hi hi hi
don't need no savior
to unwind
cause i feel aligned
and i hi hi hi
i'm drowning deeper
and I hi hi
would die to feel
alive
