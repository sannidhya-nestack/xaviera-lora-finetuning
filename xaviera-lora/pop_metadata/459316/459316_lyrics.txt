FIGHTING
Written by Andy littlewood


I’m coming up
I’ve never felt so tough
Won’t let you carry on with your fun
I’m getting out
I don’t want you around
I’ve finally seen the light
I was so blind

But now I’m ready to go
I’m taking over this show
You see I’m standing my ground
So no more putting me down
They’ll be a knockout tonight
I’ll meet you at the ringside
You know I’m never, ever, ever gonna hide

CHORUS
I’ll come up fighting
It’s so exciting
Just start me up
You know, you know, you know, you know I’ll be on top
I’ll come up fighting
A bolt of lightening
I’ll never stop
You know, you know, you know, you know I’ll be on top 
I’ll be on top

Oh Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

I’m feeling good and not misunderstood
I’m gonna take it all and watch you fall
I’m breaking free
I’m free from this disease
You’ll hear it on the news
It’s coming soon

And now I’m ready inside
It took a very long time
I’m rising up from the ground
So no more hanging around
And when the going gets tough
I’m staying right where I should
You know I never, ever, ever felt this good

REPEAT CHORUS


I’m the champion of the world
I’m the winner of this show
I’ll come up fighting
I’ll come up fighting

REPEAT CHORUS  (x2)

I’ll be on top
I’ll be on top
