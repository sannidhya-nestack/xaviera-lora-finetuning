Backseat filled hand upon the wheel * Northbound drive, I never felt more alive, more alive * Late night trips to Walmart, ride them kid skateboards down aisles * We were strange in the best way * With my ADD bestie now don't you forget me * The beauty of crazy comes out * (Chorus) You make me wanna shout! * It's so easy to let it out * and it's okay for me to be me 'cause you make it allowed * You make me shout!* You're my anchor without a doubt * and there's just some people that you can't do without * So come and make me shout! * So come and make me shout! So come and make me * Girls night in on v-day * We watched the stupidest movie ever made * We laughed for days * And joked about the boys that were never men just stupid boys * Three musketeers is all I need right here * With my meggles you dangle from starlight * You just might let beautiful crazy come out * (Chorus) * You make me wanna shout like I've never done before * I just wanna shout ooh ooh ooh yeah, you make me wanna * (Chorus) * So come and make me shout * Let the beauty of crazy come out....
