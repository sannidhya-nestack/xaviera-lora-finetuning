you find yourself just reading all the headlines
never diggin' to deep for a cause
vcrs, car phones on credit cards and golf in your spare time
don't bring me down 'cause the war don't exist in my town

don't box yourself, don't box yourself
don't box yourself all the way in

you find yourself with your head down on the subway
your walkman's on and you're buried in some magazine
avoiding their eyes, afraid of your lies
that's what some say
don't bring me down cause the war might exist in my town

CHORUS

now don't get me wrong I ain't some kind of saint sent from heaven
as a matter of fact I probably descend from hell
if you look around we're all self-servingly driven
but I get brought down 'cause the war sure exists in my town

CHORUS
