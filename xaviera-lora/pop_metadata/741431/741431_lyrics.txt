Cut my wings and drown me
I'm so sorry you found me
Why can't you tell me I'm beautiful?
This is an endless story 
Just one that fell before me
Our love is lost and I can't forget

The pain that you put me through
The way that you said you knew
That we would always be one 
I try to run from the truth 
But I'm addicted to you 
And I just can't go on 

If I fly I fall 
My world seems so small
And now I'm stuck with only memories
Right now I walk alone
No one to call my own 
My heart feels so broken
So broken, so broken, so broken

Every time I try to move on
I come back and then you're gone
And I get stuck along this road 
I'm moving slow
Last night was so tough, I 
Had to sleep without you 
I've been loving you for so long
Every thought in my head's about you 
Our love is more than a lie
You're always on my mind
But when are you going to realize 
That every time I try I get left behind
I must slip your mind 
Every feeling I find is broken because 

If I fly I fall 
My world seems so small
And now I'm stuck with only memories
Right now I walk alone
No one to call my own 
My heart feels so broken
So broken, so broken, so broken

This love's got me so broken 
Heart fell with no emotion
I thought you loved me for who I was 
You held me in your arms
Every moment was ours
If I could I would take it all back because

If I fly I fall 
My world seems so small
And now I'm stuck with only memories
Right now I walk alone
No one to call my own 
My heart feels so broken
So broken, so broken, so broken
