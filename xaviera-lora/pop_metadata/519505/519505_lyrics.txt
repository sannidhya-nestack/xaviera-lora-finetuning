Verse 1
day and night
black and white
i am the wind
i am the moonlight
o- o-
oceans won't
won't sink my boat
cuz i make the waves
i make the world float

(lead-in)
oh oh oh oh no
windows
closin
closin
no control
pushin
on my throat
i thought
i was more
somethin ain't right
somethin ain't right
i should be

Chorus
stronger than all of this
no fee-ar
danger
danger
nothin stops me
nothin stops me
i can't explain away
these tee-ars
breakin
breakin
no one told me
no one told me

Verse 2
watch the cloud
it's darker now
and when it rains
can't stop the shower
but I
push on through
it's what i do
so drunk on the love
drunk on the power

Bridge
why can't
I see
the changes
in front of me
understand
don't understand
this ain't the plan
this ain't the plan
now its no longer
in my hands
no
no
no I'm

Chorus
