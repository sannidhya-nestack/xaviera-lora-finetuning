it’s your turn shuffle and deal
a good hand is ever so rare
so play your poor hand well

today is a game of chance
take part in happenstance
take heart and play like hell

when ya lay down your cards
play like hell
let down your guard
and play, and play, and play

some may not play fair
don't despair don’t sweat the small stuff
you can always call their bluff

cause when you play by the rules
when it's your turn you'll be the one to beat
no need to cheat

when you lay down your card
play like hell
let down your guard
and play….just play

cause life's a fine, fine game
and it's a fine, fine time
to ante-up, call the trump, shuffle and deal
play and play
if nothing else play for fun
play, play
