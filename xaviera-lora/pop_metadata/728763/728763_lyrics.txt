He'll try to be what you want
In a million places
One push and he'll spring right back
While pulling new faces

Elastic man with elastic plans and lesson learned
Soul returned, unopened
Stretchy mouth for the stretchy truth
Spine removed, unbroken

He'll try to be who you want
Do the best that he's able
Be the head of the restaurant
Or a crumb at your table

Elastic man with elastic fans who'll come and go
Ebb and flow, forsaken
Bouncy groove made for bouncy mood
Vision skewed and shaken

Everything to everyone
Bending over backwards
Pin him down? (It can't be done)
His mind's made up and undone too
He's stretched so thin, he's quite see-through
All the lies are coming true
Yeah, no!
No, yeah!

Scat Vocal:
Sticky sweet
Bitter pill
No he won't
Yes he will
Hype it up
Kill the buzz
Says he can
Never does

Elastic man with elastic hands for big applause
Slamming doors, once open
Bendy pen for the bendy rules
Bendy fools have spoken

Everything to everyone but you
