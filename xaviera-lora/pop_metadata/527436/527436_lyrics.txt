Everybody wants a place in the sun
Well i don’t know
Can’t take the heat, it will burn ya up

Everybody wants to dance till the dawn
But nobody knows
Who runs the town when the sun comes up

Everybody wants to sing their own song
Well don't they know
That the world ain’t big enough
But you can listen to the one ya love

Ah ah
Imma be the joker and the queen
Ah ah
Imma be like china in smithereens
Ah ah
I was born to love the beauty in life's irony
Ah ah
Imma be a rose in a frozen field
Ah ah
Cuz imma love the beauty in life's irony


Everybody wants to be number one
Don’t it just sound dumb
Cuz number two is havin' all the fun

Everybody wants to rule the world
But it sounds absurd
Cuz the ones who tried have been badly hurt
Remember love ain't no dirty word
Ah ah
Imma be the joker and the queen
Ah ah
Imma be like china in smithereens
Ah ah
I was born to love the beauty in life's irony
Ah ah
Imma be a rose in a frozen field
Ah ah
Cuz imma love the beauty in life's irony


Ah ah
We can be the joker and the queen
Ah ah
We can be like china in smithereens
Ah ah
We were born to love the beauty in life's irony
Ah ah
We can be roses in frozen fields
Ah ah
We're gonna love the beauty in life's irony
