[Verse]
Words are flowing from my heart
Feelings shining like a spark
In the night sky we're a star
Speaking love near or far

[Verse 2]
Eyes connect a silent vow
No need for words here and now
In each heartbeat we're allowed
Speaking love through the crowd

[Chorus]
Speaking love keep it simple
Every beat like an echo
From the soul and the rhythm
Speaking love through the echoes

[Verse 3]
Hands touch whispers in between
In this moment we're a dream
In this dance no in-between
Speaking love it's our theme

[Bridge]
Every night and every day
In our hearts it’s here to stay
No words needed it's okay
Speaking love come what may

[Chorus]
Speaking love keep it simple
Every beat like an echo
From the soul and the rhythm
Speaking love through the echoes
