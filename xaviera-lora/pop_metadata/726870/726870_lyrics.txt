Verse 1:
Meet me on the beach baby
Kiss me on the white sand
Tell me you a freak baby
That's the way I like that
You don't gotta do to much
As long you kiss and touch
Don't tell me you don't like the sun
This beach is where we have fun

Chorus:
Lets have fun in the sun
Lets have fun in the sun
Lets have fun in the sun
Lets have fun in the sun

Verse 2:
You know you to much some time
You always be on my mind
Girl you always showing off
Blowin kisses at me, your lips look so soft
Lets get in the water baby lets get wet
Let have a weekend that we both wont forget
Don't act like you can't dance a lil bit
Grab you by your hands and watch you do your step

Chorus

Bridge:
Oooh You Tannin
Oooh You tannin Babe
You don't need that
You bad You Bad
I'm just giving my feedback
my feedback my feedback
come on lets go!

Chorus x2
