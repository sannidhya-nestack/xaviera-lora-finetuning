Is it far too kind
Or easier to bring myself to this?
But if I should stay
If I should stay, will I wonder what I'll miss?

Everything she does, she drives me crazy
Everything she does, she captivates me 
And now I can not forgive
I will not forget

The walls cave in, the sky falls down
And my world stands still and she falls to the ground
And all that's good
And all we are will shatter like glass
When she falls to the ground

Everything she does, she drives me crazy
Everything she does, she captivates me 
And now I can not forgive
I will not forget

Everything's gone wrong
And it's always down to you
Don't tell me why it's always been this way
Falling down

Everything she does, she drives me crazy
Everything she does, she captivates me 
And now I can not forgive
I will not forget
No I will not forget
