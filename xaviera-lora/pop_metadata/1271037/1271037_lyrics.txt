[Verse]
Woke up in the morning light
Thinking 'bout you all night
You're my daily delight
Coffee to my appetite

[Verse 2]
When I'm feeling kinda low
You pick me up you make me glow
With every sip my heart will show
My love for you it starts to flow

[Chorus]
Just like coffee in my cup
You keep me warm you lift me up
Every drop makes me feel loved
Just like coffee from above

[Bridge]
You're my morning you're my noon
You're my night when stars are strewn
Sugar sweet in every tune
Love's a melody we croon

[Verse 3]
Through the sugar and the cream
You and I we're like a dream
Hand in hand we're quite the team
Just like coffee sweet it seems

[Chorus]
Just like coffee in my cup
You keep me warm you lift me up
Every drop makes me feel loved
Just like coffee from above
