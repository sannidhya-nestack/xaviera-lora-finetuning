look at that...look at that
huddle round a stop sign
waiting on a green light talking in the  meantime 
dressed to the nines 
like cherries on a vine 
like bubble gum snapping
yap yap yaping….
ain't nothing happening happening

Nah 

Girls talk about girls
Boys talk about girls
Men talk about girls
Women talk about money 

Money

look at you…look at you 
hotter than a match head 
thinking you can talk ted 
wonder what the chick said 
caught in a spin 
that hole that you in 
you keep on tripping, 
flipping, 
sippin 
and doing it again 

Yah

Girls talk about boys
Boys talk about girls
Men talk about women
Women talk about money 

Money
 

Can't be your description of women that's fiction
If I got to go that will that will be my decision
I'll take care of me and the world that i live in alone


(Instrumental) 


Girls talk about boys
Boys talk about girls
Men talk about women
Women talk about money 

Money 

I gonna get me some 
Follow me watch it come 
I gonna get me some 
Follow me watch it come 


Girls talk about boys
Boys talk about girls
Men talk about women
Women talk about money 

Money 

You know it honey 

So..Where’s my money?
