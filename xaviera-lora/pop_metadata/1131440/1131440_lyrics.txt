I Can't Wait
Taylor / D'Sa

I like us hanging out
we're having tons of fun
something good is going down
and we've barely just begun

ch:
 I can't wait--it's getting better by the moment
 Feels so great--we've got it all and we both know it
 holding hands, don't need plans
 we're riding high, we're on a roll 
 Trusting fate, let's celebrate,
 oh oh oh, I can't wait

we could lounge around at home
or party under neon lights         
you can fly me to the moon
everyday and every night

ch:

br:
even when I'm sleeping
I keep on make-believing,
dreaming 'bout being close to you...ooh

Ch:
 I can't wait--it's getting better by the moment
 Feels so great--we've got it all and we both know it
 holding hands, don't need plans
 we're riding high, we're on a roll          
 Trusting fate, let's celebrate,
 oh oh oh, I can't wait
