You left graffiti on the edge of my heart
You made it easy now it's far too hard
Your turning candles into dynamite
I'm drawing shadows in the morning light

You tune the strings inside my mind
A mental melody so hard to find
You took the colours and you turned them gold
You took my words underlined them in bold

You turned a dead son into a man
And now it seems i'm doing all i can 
Cos this world don't feel like (home without you)

I'm turning pillows in my homemade grave
I'm shooting windows not to misbehave
I Killed the king on a chopping board
I'm cutting knives cos they feel ignored

I'm reading pages in a coffee bean
And now i'm sipping on a magazine
I'm going left on a circular saw
I'm scoring goals but i don't know the score

I'm making shapes with the memory foam
I'm placing bets on a semitone
