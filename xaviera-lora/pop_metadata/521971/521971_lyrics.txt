It’s a summer’s day somewhere in July
I had a swim today and I’ve been wondering why
When I felt satisfied, missing the signs,
When I felt reassured, nothing to hide
You take in my summertime blue
I am here falling for you

On a summer’s day somewhere near the pool
Your eyes are twinkling and the water’s cool 
In my head is adventure, though still in doubt
My heart’s watering down, come in and find out
Take in my summertime blue
I am here falling for you

Take in my summertime blue
I am here falling for you

It’s a summer’s day the late afternoon,
I had a drink and it must all be over soon
Oh my heart is beating, something to hide
I hate men competing but my hands are tied
Take in my summertime blue
I am here falling for you
