[Verse]
Blue rivers flow gently
Sunlight in my eyes
Dancing shadows play
Under clear blue skies

[Verse 2]
Soft whispers in the breeze
Nature's sweet embrace
Memories in the trees
Time slows its pace

[Chorus]
Blue rivers and you
Dreams come alive
Hand in hand we move
A love we can't deny

[Verse 3]
Golden fields we roam
Endless days of light
Laughter in our home
Stars shine so bright

[Bridge]
In your eyes I see
A world so true
Lost in harmony
With rivers blue

[Chorus]
Blue rivers and you
Dreams come alive
Hand in hand we move
A love we can't deny
