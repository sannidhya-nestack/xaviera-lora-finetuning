"Two Hearts Bleed"


I’d drive a million miles tonight,
To simply find and touch your skin;
You’re all I’ve ever known that’s right,
And I’ve been places no one’s been…
You’re a light in this deep darkness,
That surrounds me hoping I’ll give in;
But you’re the diamond that I miss,
And I won’t stop until you're found again.

CHORUS
When I find you
I will hold you
I will love you through an endless dream;
When together
We'll remember
That alone our two hearts bleed...
Alone our two hearts bleed. 

That horizon in the distance,
Calls to me and whispers you're still there;
In the quiet of this instance,
All I feel is me buried in your hair…
All the quiet nights await us,
And leaves us nothing left to dare;
Now I’m driving with just one wish,
Let me fall into your arms and breathe your air.

CHORUS
When I find you
I will hold you
I will love you through an endless dream;
When together
We’ll remember
That alone our two hearts bleed...

[BRIDGE]
There’s no detour,
There’s no red light,
No, there is nothing stopping me;
You’re what I’m for,
Through this midnight –
You’re all I want to see…

CHORUS  (2x)
When I find you
I will hold you
I will love you through an endless dream;
When together
We’ll remember
That alone our two hearts bleed...
Alone our two hearts bleed...
Alone our two hearts bleed.
