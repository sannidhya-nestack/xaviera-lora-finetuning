This is the day
This is the moment
Let’s come together 
And lift our voices
Hold back nothing
Speak up loud
This is our moment in time

Hey! What are you doing all alone?
We’ll never solve-this-on-our-own 

We gotta’
stand up, stand up never gonna let them take us down today
Gotta keep our head up, head up cuz you know they only want it their own way
Better never give up give up, cuz you know they’re gonna fight us all the way
And when you feel that you can’t go on…
Got to stand up cuz today’s a new day

This has been
A long time comin’
Keepin’ silent when
There’s somethin’ to say
They’ll only listen when
They can’t ignore us
We stand together…
They can’t push us away

Hey! What are you doing all alone?
We’ll never solve-this-on-our-own…

CHORUS

Two steps forward, no steps back
Keep It Up – Keep It Up… and lift those hands
Never give up, give in, let go, let’s get started
I feel you rising… I see you, see you
