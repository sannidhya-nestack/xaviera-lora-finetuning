[Verse]
Paisley dreams around me
Colors swirl day and night
See the patterns floating high
Underneath the starry sky

[Verse 2]
Magic in our hands we hold
Whisper softly secrets told
Walk along this winding road
Bright designs our hearts unfold

[Chorus]
Paisley me into your life
Paint your world with shades so bright
Together we can dance in light
In this dream we take our flight

[Verse 3]
Laughter echoes through the air
In this moment nothing rare
Paisley love beyond compare
You and I a perfect pair

[Chorus]
Paisley me into your life
Paint your world with shades so bright
Together we can dance in light
In this dream we take our flight

[Bridge]
Hold my hand don't let it go
Feel the waves of colors flow
In this tapestry we sew
Watch our love forever grow
