Lyrics
When it started out it was nothing at all 
You were kind of startling 
Angled and withdrawn
Looking for a map of the world or a song 
I don’t know 

Suddenly I’m losing my head in a rush 
Everything is highly defined and I’m fucking up 
You can see me running alone in the street 
Will you though 

I can see the bright lights glowing 
The alarm starts going 
And I think I’ve made a terrible mistake 
But we’re all dying anyway 
Even if it kills me 
Even if I don’t recover 
I would rather be killed by a lover 
I can see the bright lights 

Something isn’t working I can’t find the words 
Summertime adrenaline left me an afterburn 
Looking for a map of the world or a song 
I don’t know 

Swimming in and out of a chemical sleep 
Doubled over trying to drown in my bed sheets 
You can see me running alone in the street 
Will you though 

Someday when you see me 
I’ll be remote controlled 
Call my name 
I’ll wave and say hello
