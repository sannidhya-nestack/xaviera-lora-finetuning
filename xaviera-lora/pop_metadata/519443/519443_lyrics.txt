life is short and sweet 
like a butterfly 
born to break free 
life is but a dream 
fire can be warm 
the colors can be bright 
but even the sunshine burns 

i am a flower i am a rose 
out of the ground i’m gonna grow 
i’m gonna bloom 
cuz i am a bird on top of the world 
i am more than just a little girl 
i’m gonna fly cause i wanna know what i’m made of 

i am everything 
nothing what i seem 
more than who i am only what i bring  weather’s getting cold rain making snow but even the cold can burn
