Verse:

She don't ask me questions
She don't worry about my past
I tell her I'm a three-time loser
She'll change the subject fast
What's on her mind is the love we find
Each and every day
She wants the man I turned out to be
Not the man I was along the way 

Chorus:

She don't care about the what I was
She's crazy 'bout the who I am
All that matters is the here and now
Not the why and the where and the when
Yesterday is dead and gone
She wants me to be her man
She don't care about the what I was
She's crazy 'bout the who I am

Verse:

I used to hang around with the devil
Lot of drinkin' and a-carryin' on
Every night with a different stranger
Raisin' hell until dawn
But the day we met I swore I'd forget
The good time ladies and the wine
She's the only woman believes in me
I would be a fool to ever leave her behind 

Chorus

Bridge

What's on her mind is the love we find
Each and every day
She wants the man I turned out to be
Not the man I was along the way

Chorus
