Got a feeling
There's something real about this love
My head is reeling
IN a most unusual way
The blue skies never looked so blue
But I'm no blue today
I've got a feeling
And I like feeling this way

The birds are singing
Right outside of my window
And it's bringing
A feeling that's making my day
'Cause when I hear those birds just singing
Feels like Summer's here to stay
I've got a feeling
And I like feeling this way

I've had some painful yesterdays
Some loves that never bloomed
Gonna push those memories aside
Gonna make some more room

Sweet romance is rolling down my avenue
A new chance.....gonna embrace a new day
And nothing's going to stop me now
Here I come now, come what may
I've got a feeling
And I like feeling this way
