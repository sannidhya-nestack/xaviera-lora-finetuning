You didn't know, because you didn't want to: those things i thought were true. And all I kept was the hardwood stain that your baggage left. I'm free of your insecurities, are you? 

I am falling up and you can't bring me down.
I still hear your voice, calling me somehow.
Way up here there's one last thing I need, 
and I'm calling all the cars to bring you back to me.

I'm free from your gravity. 
You breathe: I can't feel your breeze from here.

I am falling up and you can't bring me down.

I got the letter that you left on my doorstep bring you back from my past tense
take back the watches that you bought when I said I needed more time (not more clocks).
I needed space to breathe
I never meant for you to leave
