Yeeehh!!!

I was on to eliminated any of your mistakes
All of the big rocks put it on my way did´t cause me to forsake
Just one little thing 
remains me on the day,and the pain and the pieces that I mean that
I never belive that the sun is made them real

All the plans that I had made 
finaly became real
so many years without any change 
to me it was no big deal

The summer is sunny day
and the peace that I meet I never belive that the sun is made them wheel


The time has come to say goodbye
And to leave you all behind
The time has come to say goodbye
And leave you all behind

My heart belongs to you 
My love allways be true 

My heart belongs to you 
My love allways be true 

Yeeehh!!!
