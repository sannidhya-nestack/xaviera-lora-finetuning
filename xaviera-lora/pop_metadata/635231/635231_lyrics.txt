You Make Me Sing

(verse 1)
You, you make me sing... about happy things and
You make my heart ring... I feel just like a
spoonful of joy, I twirl like a toy, 
rushing with sunshine, lifting my voice
You just make me want to sing

(verse 2)
I, I’m taken in.. I feel warm and toasty
I just love it when.. you got this way of     
Bringing me up, smoothing me out,
rounding my edges, trashing the rut
You just make me want to sing

(bridge)
I see you here beside me
It’s better than before
You sail me straight to happy
With so much more in store
I can’t contain this stirring urge of singing  (doo…)

(verse 3)
You, you make me sing...like daydream-inspired
Blue fresh morning wind.. each whisper of you
floats ‘round my mind, drifts out of time, 
bounces through heaven ‘cause you’re so divine
You just make me want to sing

(repeat bridge)
