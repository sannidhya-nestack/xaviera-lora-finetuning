Everywhere I see Your eyes, shining on me 
Your love stretching out a path for me
Everywhere I feel Your smile lingering on me
Your Grace covering a life for me
Chorus
Everywhere around me
Everything around me
Every flower, every breath, every tree, every life

Everywhere I look, I see your face
Everywhere I turn reflections of You
Every sound is music from Your mind
The sunlight is Your warmth around me

Chorus

Bridge
Without You, I can't breathe, Without YouI can't be, Without You there's nothing,
Without You, there's no me
