The Calm


Follow the river down from the stream
Over the mountains and into the sea                             
I want to go, oh where that river flows
Let me go

I see an angel speading her wings                         
Perfect and graceful, the aura she brings                           
I want to fly oh where the angels fly                                  
Let’s go tonight 

The calm after the storm
Makes me want to
The calm after the storm
Helps me break through
The calm after the storm
That moment when fantasy rules

Capture the image
A black and white film
A celluloid classic
Both haunting and chilled
I want to be oh in that 40’s dream              
Of a movie scene         

The calm after the storm
Makes me want to
The calm after the storm
Helps me break through
The calm after the storm
A feeling too good to be true

The calm after the storm
Makes me want to
The calm after the storm
Helps me break through
The calm after the storm
Makes me want to
The calm after the storm
That moment when fantasy rules

A feeling too good to be true
