You must think I'm broken now,
about all the things we spoke about.
The fact that we did is not your way out.

You must talk bout how I feel,
And what it means when i sigh.
Well truth be told, I'm doing alright.

And if I don't I'll never let you see
What it does to me and how it feels to me.
I keep my feet right on the ground,
You shut me down.

I'm shut down, let's reboot now.
I think I'm ready 'cause I'm feeling real good now.
I got stuff to do, school and everything,
I hope I don't crash or anything.

You must think it's over now,
That everything's all sorted out.
If that's what you think, then knock yourself out.

If I wanna tell you how I feel,
Only these words can come out of me:
Well truth be told, Im doing alright.

And if I don't I'll never let you see
What it does to me and how it feels to me.
I keep my feet right on the ground,
You shut me down.

I'm shut down, let's reboot now.
I think I'm ready 'cause I'm feeling real good now.
I got stuff to do, school and everything,
I hope I don't crash or anything.
