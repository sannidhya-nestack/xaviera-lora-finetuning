Let's play a little game. 
You'll be a prince and I'll be a princess. 
Boy, just don't be too lame.
I'm gonna make you play or I'm breaking all the glass. 

We are nasty in our souls. 
You're a scary clown and I'm a spooky doll.
Darling, would you be that kind? 
Promise me that you will catch me when I fall. 

Being dressed with lace, and black nails. My warm embrace was never enough for your own game.

Why did you bring roses to that other girl? 
She doesn't belong to our magic world. 
Why did you stare at that other girl?
She doesn't belong to our magic world.
Why did you bring roses to that other girl?
