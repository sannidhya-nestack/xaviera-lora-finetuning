It’s a good day
It’s a good life
But you're walking around with your head down

It’s a good life 
It’s a good day
Get ready to go and you will be on your way

Better let go
Negative flow
Dile adiós

Say it again
Do it and win
Everything and you will be on your way

Go have fun don’t be scared, just live a little
Feel your heart flame, burn, when you live a little, live a little

It’s a good yeah
When you shout out
Still your head is stuck in a grey cloud

When you shout out
It’s a good yeah 
Get ready to go and you will be on your way

Better let go
Negative flow
Dile adiós

Say it again
Do it and win
Everything and you will be on your way

Feel your heart flame, burn, when you live a little
Go have fun don’t be scared, just live a little, live a little

You know it’s a good life
So don’t go waste it
Stop a second cause I know you can taste it
Tell me what you wanna
Do and then we’re gonna
Make it happen cos nothing can replace it
Don’t need no million to have, have a good time
All that you need is some fun to have a good life
Summer party
Move your body
Shake-a-shake-it to the beat everybody

It’s a good day
It’s a good life
But you're walking around with your head down

It’s a good life 
It’s a good day
Get ready to go and you will be on your way

Better let go
Negative flow
Dile adiós

Say it again
Do it and win
Everything and you will be on your way

Better let go
Negative flow
Dile adiós, oh 

Go have fun don’t be scared just live a little
Go have fun don’t be scared just live a little
Go have fun don’t be scared just live a little
