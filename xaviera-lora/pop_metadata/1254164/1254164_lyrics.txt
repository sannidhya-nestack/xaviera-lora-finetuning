LYRICS FOR DRIVING THROUGH TEARS
Words and Music by Lee Johnson

[Intro]
Driving through tears
Driving through tears
It feels like I haven't
Seen you for years
Driving through tears
Driving through tears

[Verse 1]
Picture yourself 
In a car downtown
With neon lights 
And concrete skies 
Someone calls you
Your heartrate is slowing 
A voice that's filled with goodbyes 
Streetlights flash 
You're holding tight 
Trying to make it to his side 
Look for the love 
That's just out of sight 
But he's gone

[Chorus]
Driving through tears
Driving through tears
It feels like I haven't
Seen you for years
Driving through tears
Driving through tears

[Verse 2]
Follow the road 
To the place where we met 
Where we laughed
And danced until dawn 
But now it's a shrine 
To the love we had left 
And memories 
Of what is now gone 
Cars pass by
But I'm standing still 
Wishing I could bring 
Him back to life 
My heart is breaking
But I love him still 
And he's gone

[Chorus]
Driving through tears
Driving through tears
It feels like I haven't
Seen you for years
Driving through tears
Driving through tears

[Bridge]
I drive on
Through the night 
And the rain 
And the pain
Thinking of the love 
That we shared 
Memories like diamonds 
That shine so very bright 
I really could have sworn 
That he cared
Time after time 
I imagine that he's there
But reality sets in quickly
And it hits me again,
It hits me very hard again
That he's gone

Chorus]
Driving through tears
Driving through tears
It feels like I haven't
Seen you for years
Driving through tears
Driving through tears

[Outro]
