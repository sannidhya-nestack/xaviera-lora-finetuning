[Verse]
Sunshine in the morning
Coffee cup and yawning
Every day is new
When I’m with you

[Verse 2]
Dancing in the sunlight
Never a dark night
Smiling through and through
All because of you

[Chorus]
Loving you is like
A sunny day’s delight
Every moment feels so right
Oh loving you is like

[Verse 3]
Walking in a rainbow
Feelings that just overflow
Every color bright
In your light

[Verse 4]
Butterflies and dreams
Laughter in our seams
Holding you so tight
Feels so right

[Chorus]
Loving you is like
A sunny day’s delight
Every moment feels so right
Oh loving you is like
