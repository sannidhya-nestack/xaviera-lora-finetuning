You, me, coffee and the sunshine
Honey, I love our journey
years of you and me
My dear, we made it through these years
And we’ve built our dream

Open, my eyes are open
Ready for another new day
I’m sure, yeah baby I’m sure
We’ll be going on our way

PRE.Are you cooking?
I love when you do it
I love starting the day like this
Are you smiling
I love when you do it
I love starting the day like this


HOOK: You,me, coffee and sunshine
Isn’t it marvellous?
You,me, coffee and the sunshine
It’s all about us

Problems, we are used to solve them
They change like the weather
Worried? No I’m not worried
We’ll face’em together

PRE.Are you laughin?
I love when you do it
I love starting the day like this
Are you wishing?
I love when you do it
I love starting the day like this


H: You,me, coffee and sunshine
Isn’t it marvellous?
You,me, coffee and the sunshine
Love is all about us

Every day is a amazing
Every new day is all I am waiting
