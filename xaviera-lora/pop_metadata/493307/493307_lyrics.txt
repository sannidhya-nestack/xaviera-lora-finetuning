There are those who think I'm a man on a mission
A man with a vision or two
There are those who would laugh at my fear of decision
I think it's funny too

And I've been a lot of places
And I have seen a lot things
And I wonder why I know nothing

If I don't open up enough
Twist the knife deep in my gut
Lucky loser loves to fail
I'm on the edge so push me in
pain and pleasure breaks the skin
I'm happy here beyond the pale
On my bed of nails

There are those who think I'm a man of ambition
A slave to a master plan
There are those who view me with doubt and suspicion
An I quite understand
'cause I've been a lot of places 
And I have seen a lot of things
And I wonder why I know nothing
And I've known a lot of people 
And I did a lot of things
And I made them cry and all for nothing

If I don't open up enough
Twist the knife deep in my gut
Lucky loser loves to fail
I'm on the edge so push me in
pain and pleasure breaks the skin
I'm happy here beyond the pale
On my bed of nails

(Whatcha gonna do when the sun goes down?
Whatcha gonna do when the nighttime comes around?
Here it goes again
Here we go again
Here it comes...)

Happiness is the best revenge
