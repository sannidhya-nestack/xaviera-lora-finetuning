Tired of being alone, alone in the dark
Light, my light again, the blame cannot be gone
I needed this girl to stay in my life, but I lost her
How can she not be the one for me and I the one for

You, ooh, just dream that you put your arms around me
Ooh, just dream that you put your arms around me

Now I’m weak, and now I’m lost
and now I’ve cried and cried, I, I’ve woken up 
Why do I have to write the words that belong to this song
We could have been together, forever we’ll be holding on
Yeah Doesn’t even matter, doesn’t even care

Oh, oh, just dream that you put your arms around me
Oh, oh, just dream that you put your arms around me

Around me, around me, around me

Around me, oh, just dream that you put your arms around me
Oh oh, just dream that you put your arms around me

See the fields of flowers, birds up in the sky, when I dream of you
Let’s fly away, with me

If there was a medicine for this hurt, I gave it to you
So once your heart is broken, you won’t get what I’m going through
You won’t get what I’m going through, I love you
