I was wrong to say
I wouldn’t change a thing cause
In the story of our lives
The best of times
Through colored glass

And if you should call
It’s no trouble, no trouble at all
I’ll take out the sound
Back where we begun again

Put it on the right track, get it right back
A message from my heart it’s too loud to stay apart
So put it on the right track, steal it right back
It’s high time now

Time goes on 
enough to let me move on past 
But every little now & then 
it creeps on back 
to shade my smile

I’m here once again
But I’m deep & I’m feelin’ a pain
So who takes the fall 
that covers it all again

Put it on the right track, get it right back
A message from my heart it’s too loud to stay apart
So put it on the right track, steal it right back
It’s high time now
