[Verse]
Woke up in the morning light
Sunshine makes everything right
Got no worries in my sight
Feels like it's gonna be bright

[Verse 2]
Walking down the busy street
Smiling at everyone I meet
Feel the rhythm in my feet
Lucky days just can't be beat

[Chorus]
Luckily luckily feeling so free
Everything's falling in place for me
Luckily luckily can't you see
Life's a dream as sweet as can be

[Bridge]
Dancing in the afternoon glow
Where this path leads I don't know
But happily I will go
With this happy heart that I tow

[Verse 3]
Stars are sparkling in the sky
Night arrives I don’t ask why
Grateful for the days gone by
Luck is smiling I feel fine

[Chorus]
Luckily luckily feeling so free
Everything's falling in place for me
Luckily luckily can't you see
Life's a dream as sweet as can be
