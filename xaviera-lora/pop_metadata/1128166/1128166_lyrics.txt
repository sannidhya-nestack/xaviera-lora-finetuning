Baby, what you done to me
Sorrow like my heart has never known
You awakened a long forgotten part of me
And you ran off and left me alone
The poets speak of those who loved and lost
Are somehow better than those who never loved at all
I'm no poet but baby when I weigh the cost
Soaring high was just not worth the fall
Once upon a time my dreams were untethered
There was no place my heart couldn't go
Now I am lost and my spirit is weathered
I just don't know how to let go
(Instrumental interlude)
Baby
What you done to me
In the wee hours
I walk the lonely streets
And the shadows
Stretch out like a lonely sea
In such darkness
I can't find my feet
And the whiskey barely helps to ease the pain
As the sad songs pour into my soul
The echoes of a lover's loss, the sad refrain
Play out in this bottomless hole
(Musical interlude)
