Verse 1
One last talk is all that I can do
I got no right answer left for you
No more blank pages left to write on 
I keep on circling back to you

Cause night after night after night we’re fighting
We got nothing left to do
I draw a line that I won’t step over
Cause I don’t need you that bad

Chorus 1
And I’ll be loving you
For the last time
Giving up tonight
I’ll be gone

I won’t stay to fight
I won’t even try
This we can’t rewrite
(cause) I’ll be gone

Verse 2

Do you remember when we talked on the phone
Late at night I just knew that you’re weren’t alone 
But at the same time I was gone hanging loose
with a girl that I knew from before

We already knew what we know now 
I just drew faster in our mexican stand off
cause don’t want you that bad

Chorus 2
And I’ll be loving you
For the last time
Giving up tonight
I’ll be gone

I won’t stay to fight
I won’t even try
This we can’t rewrite
(cause) I’ll be gone

Bridge

Chorus 3
And I’ll be loving you
For the last time
Giving up tonight
I’ll be gone

I won’t stay to fight
I won’t even try
This we can’t rewrite
(cause) I’ll be gone
