1. The city is all muddled like a badly written haiku
Jumbled like the traffic, buzzing with images of you

The lights stream by like an urban artist's palette
Shimmering mirages of the dreams I had of you

Refrain
As I walk by the 9th street station
I see your reflection in the glass moon
As I walk by   the 9th Street station
Your shadow eclipses me and swallows me whole


2. The river's twisting and turning like a lost kite in the sky
Fluttering and cut up with the memory boats of you

The people rush by, enter and exit like it's just a play
Intense and complex like  Shakespeare wrote on you

3. The trains ride up and down, hardly caring about me or you
Twisting and turning like knitting needles around my woollen mind

The stations drift by like ghosts and  silver smokescreens
Flickering and burning neon signs of my life
