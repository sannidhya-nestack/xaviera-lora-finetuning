I want to know you

Want to feel how fast my heartv would beat if you were close to me

I want to show you

Want to let you loose inside my brain to see if you'd run or stay


I can't seem to look away

I'm hypnotized by you

I'm hanging on to what you say

I'm hypnotized by you


No one on this world that I'd rather spend this day with, it's you


Loving you is so easy

Loving you is so easy


I can't seem to look away

I'm hypnotized by you

I'm hanging on to what you say

I'm hypnotized by you
