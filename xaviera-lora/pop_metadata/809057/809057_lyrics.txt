I've been looking at you and hoping that you would look my way
I've been telephoning, not knowing, quite what to say
Here I go - to put my heart on the line
Never know - that we were two of a kind

And when I fell for you
That you would fall for me too

I've fallen for you and all the little things you do
I'm tingling through and through at every thought of you
I want to show you everyday just how this has come true
Cause I've fallen for you

Now that we're together forever, you gotta know it's true
That nothing whatsoever could ever take me away from you
You and I - it is amazing how things can change within a
Blink of an eye - when you told me that you were hoping

That when you fell for me that I would fall for you too

I've fallen for you and all the little things you do
I'm tingling through and through at every thought of you
I want to show you everyday just how this has come true
Cause I've fallen for you

Fallen, fallen for you, fallen, fall...
Fallen, fallen for you, fall...

When I fell for you
You fell for me too

I've fallen for you and all the little things you do
I'm tingling through and through at every thought of you
I want to show you everyday just how this has come true
Cause I've fallen 
I've fallen 
I've fallen for you
