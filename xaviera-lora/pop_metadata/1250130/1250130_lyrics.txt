[Verse]
Every time I see your face
Heartbeats start to race
Tiny sparks in the night
Shining moments feel so right

[Verse 2]
Whispered words in the dark
They light a little spark
Holding hands under stars
No matter where we are

[Chorus]
Sweet somethings in my ear
You make my world so clear
Sweet somethings hold me tight
You're my glowing light

[Verse 3]
Morning coffee side by side
Love with nowhere to hide
Gentle touch feels so pure
In your arms I feel secure

[Bridge]
Together we found the key
Love's sweet symphony
With you here by my side
Our spirits collide

[Chorus]
Sweet somethings in my ear
You make my world so clear
Sweet somethings hold me tight
You're my glowing light
