Verse 1:
You are my desire
To rise above the sky
In touch down to them
Give them something to hold onto
Give them something to hold onto
No matter where I go
No matter what I do
No matter what road it always leads to you
Smokey days and restless nights 
Is all I need to spark the fire in your eyes
In your eyes

Chorus:
Turn your words to light
As we find our way back home
Let us seek what must be found
But tell me where do we go
Where do we go from here

Verse 2:
I’m feeling alive when the music is on
The world will teach me to die but it’s to soon to be gone, so I choose to be strong
But as the hate is seeping inside it’s the use of a song 
That keeps the truth alive to prove my mind would never do me wrong
Truly lost to forever be great so together we say
Never the day will we turn away from the heavenly gate
And better escapes and troubles that our affection creates
As destiny for me to stumble, I’m humble but I’m asking, is this a test of my faith
This mess that I face has a weird way of working itself
Encourage the help, in this dark world, is burning in hell
Finding success means learning to fail, feeling brain dead
Working my cells, my life’s behind bars, words from a jail
Breaking out letting the built up emotion free
Hopelessly stuck in this box, the rhythm holds the key
Now that my spirit chose to see the holy ghost in me
I’m sweeping up the shattered wishes of these broken dreams

Chorus:
Turn your words to light
As we find our way back home
Let us seek what must be found
But tell me where do we go
Where do we go from here


Bridge:
As we drift and slip into
A luminous world that fades your faith
A battleground of love and graves with names
Gather ‘round and watch them tame your flame
We don’t wish to go so we fly above
Over this war and see we’re lost
Sail the skies, stay brave and wise
Until our hearts are one

Chorus:
Turn your words to light
As we find our way back home
Let us seek what must be found
But tell me where do we go
Where do we go from here

Chorus:
Turn your words to light
As we find our way back home
Let us seek what must be found
But tell me where do we go
Where do we go from here
