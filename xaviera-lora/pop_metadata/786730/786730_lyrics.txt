Lyrics
Verse 1:
I can float, like devastation.
I can vanish, in the leaves.
Leave the broad constellations,
For the endless underseas.

Pre Chorus:
Roses in the graveyard, roses in the garden.
Scattered in the black, deleted scenes.
I've been writing pages, no one ever reads.
Oooh, pop dreams.

Chorus:
Oooh, I've been writing pop dreams. Oooh...

Verse 2:
I can speak, to the silence,
Play a singular refrain.
And I pull back the curtain,
But the view remains the same.
