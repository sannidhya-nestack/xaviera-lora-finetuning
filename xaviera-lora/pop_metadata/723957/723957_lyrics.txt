Stuck in a replay
Floating away
Keep us alive, keep me inside
There is no letting go
Baby find me again
Baby find me again

Our chain is breaking
I don’t know where to begin
Why am I here, beggin’ to win
I am not letting go
Baby find me again
I’ll be right here waiting
Baby find me again

(chorus)
Don't let us take a fall
Don't close another door
We used to have it all
But we don’t anymore
Oh baby, I won’t turn away
It’s gonna be ok and
We will be fine
We are not over

I’m holding your hand
Fighting you back in my life
No one to blame, no where to hide
Without you I’m dying
Baby find me again
You gotta keep trying
Baby find me again

(chorus)
Don't let us take a fall
Don't close another door
We used to have it all
But we don’t anymore
Oh baby, I won’t turn away
It’s gonna be ok and
We will be fine
We are not over
We will be fine
We are not over

Life is on hold right now
Waiting for a sign
Don’t you remember I am yours and you are mine

Don't let us take a fall
Don't close another door
We used to have it all
But we don’t anymore
Baby find me again
I am right here waiting…

(chorus)
Don't let us take a fall
Don't close another door
We used to have it all
But we don’t anymore

Don't let us take a fall
Don't close another door
We used to have it all
But we don’t anymore

Oh baby, I won’t turn away
It’s gonna be ok and
We will be fine
We are not over
We will be fine
We are not over

Won’t turn away
It’s gonna be ok and
We will be fine
We are not over
We will be fine
We are not over

Baby find me again
