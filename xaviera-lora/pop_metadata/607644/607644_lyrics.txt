Survive, survive, survive· Alive, alive, alive· Amidst rotting and rust, and leaves and dust· Your grace and your haunting· While you laugh, your belly is burning· With your beasts and your spear· Your darkening fear· Invites these thoughts with their swords· With their swords· I don’t quite know what it is I see· Man, you look different· You’ve got some strange, strange, strange· Energy· We are old film props from cowboy towns· So convincing but fragile and thin· You stand so tall with your shoulders pulled back· You are so well composed my dear, old friend· Won’t you forgive me? I did not know· With your beasts and your spear· Your darkening fear· Invites these thoughts with their swords· With their swords· I don’t quite know what it is I see· Man, you look different you’ve got some strange, strange, strange,· Energy· Deep down, down, down into your sea· Deep down, down, down into your sea· Survive, survive, survive· Alive, alive, alive· Survive, survive, survive· With your beasts and your spear· Your darkening fear· Invites these thoughts with their swords· With their swords· I don’t quite know what it is I see· Man, you look different you’ve got some· strange, strange, strange· Energy
