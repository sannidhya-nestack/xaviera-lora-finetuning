I saw you walking by
round 3 pm at the height of ashbury street
It was the beginning of spring
And i was wondering why My heart just skipped a beat
My hands started trembling, my feet couldn’t move
And i was losing my cool
My legs started shaking, my eyes were glued
And all that because of you


You set me on fire
Feels Like the sun’s burning down on me
You can take me higher
If i’m falling at your feet

you’re shining down
On my skin
A sweet sin
Feels like the middle of june

You set me on fire
Like no one else could do

it’s not the first time
i’ve seen you before but i’m shyer than i seem
everytime i try
to make a move it’s so much harder than i’ve forseen
My hands start trembling, my feet cannot move
And i am losing my cool
My legs start shaking, my eyes are glued
And all that because of you

You set me on fire
Feels Like the sun’s burning down on me
You can take me higher
If i’m falling at your feet

you’re shining down
On my skin
A sweet sin
Feels like the middle of june

You set me on fire
Like no one else could do


Got my eyes wide open
My heart could be broken
But i’m reaching out to you
Feels like a token
Cause no one has spoken
But i’m reaching out to you
