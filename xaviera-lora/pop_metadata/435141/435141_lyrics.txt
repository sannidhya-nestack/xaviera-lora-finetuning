(she's going into the house)
 
i wish i was small in my sins
i wish that i made very soft angel sighs
i wish i was small in my sins
i wish that i had very large angel eyes
 
10:45      10:45
 
i wish i could stay the hands of fear
i wish that i could calm the beast inside my head
i wish i could allay the hands of fear
i wish that i could stop the color of this red
i want the morning sliding up between my toes
dancing in her yellow velvet robe, oh
 
10:45 you're still alive
10:45 i can still cry

i wish i was small in my sins
i wish that i made very soft angel sighs
i wish i was small in my sins
i wish that i had very large angel eyes
i want the morning sliding up between my toes
 
dancing in her yellow velvet robe
  
10:45 you're still alive
10:45 i can still cry
