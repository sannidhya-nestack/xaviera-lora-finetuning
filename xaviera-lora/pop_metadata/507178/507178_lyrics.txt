EVE

Eve life is nice
Hung so delicate on a string
That is tide inside to an artery from your heart
That supplies no surprise
The now faltering fool I am
Just a boy save a man from the uncertainty of your doubt
Cause I can’t pretend

Oh how I absolutely adore you Eve

Eve believe when I say
That this isn't about your age
With a sigh you imply
You are questioning my intent
And I shunt defend

Oh how I absolutely adore you Eve
So positively adore you Eve

Eve When I say to you
That we never should be apart
Is there doubt in your head instead
Did you know I cannot comprehend

How much I live to adore you Eve
Positively adore you Eve

They say when you love a woman try to let it show
I'm not willing to pay you for a debt I do not owe oh oh

Eve life is so nice
Hung precarious on a string
Take a swing for love could bring you
Fine out how I long to adore you Eve

Absolutely adore you Eve
Positively adore you Eve
Did I say I adore you
