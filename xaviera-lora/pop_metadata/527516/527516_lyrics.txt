Can’t get you out of my head
Out of my head
So tired but I’ll sleep when I’m dead
Sleep when I’m dead
Bipolar thoughts are breezing through my brain unsaid
On an endorphin collision ahead

Try to remember what you said
Oh what you said
My belly button tingles instead
So I won’t forget
That my heart and head speak a different dialect
Like friendly fire in my bed

Ohow ow
Won’t you give me just a spoiler alert
Ohow ow
Cause I need to know if your casual flirt
Will make my heart feel disturbed
Ohow ow
I’m just beggin’ for a spoiler alert
If I could only knew I’ll get hurt
From a preview out of your shirt
I wouldn’t feel freakingly frantic, over romantic, melodramatic, psychopathic by you

It’s not the script that I read
In case we’d met
Impulsive actions are not my best bet
Hasn’t helped me yet
If the “girl meets a boy” scene would be so complex
I wouldn’t audition for that

But you didn’t seem to feel this threat
Didn’t make you sweat
We looked like Angelina and Brad
blond and brunette
The sparkle in your eyes gave me a fever in this dumbstruck duet
Or was it fire and forget?

Ohow ow
Won’t you give me just a spoiler alert
Ohow ow
Cause I need to know if your casual flirt
Will make my heart feel disturbed
Ohow ow
I’m just beggin for a spoiler alert
If I could only knew I’ll get hurt
From a preview out of your shirt
I wouldn’t feel freakingly frantic, over romantic, melodramatic, psychopathic by you

If I could read your mind all right
I wouldn’t act un cool
If I could read the signs all right
I won’t feel like a fool
If I knew how to place my bet on your number of this roulette
I wouldn’t feel freakingly frantic, over romantic, melodramatic, psychopathic from you

Ohow ow
Won’t you give me just a spoiler alert
Ohow ow
Cause I need to know if your casual flirt
Will make my heart feel disturbed
Ohow ow
Won’t you give me just a spoiler alert
Ohow ow
