I was walking, down a lonely street, not looking ahead of me
As I passed the corner I saw you standing there, you were a million miles away, your
 mind swimming with the stars that day

I won’t fall apart for you
No, it’s the one thing I just wouldn’t do
I won’t fall apart for you
Each day I get stronger
Do you, Do you miss me too?

I remember the fire in your eyes,  Spoken “oh I remember baby”
the way your stare pierced through me
No words can express the way I feel inside, 
I’ve moved on, but your heart still calls to me

I won’t fall apart for you
No, it’s the one thing I just wouldn’t do
I won’t fall apart for you
Each day I get stronger
Do you, Do you miss me too?

Oh, I won’t fall apart for you
No, it’s the one thing I just wouldn’t do
I won’t fall apart for you
Each day I get stronger
Do you, Do you miss me too?

Spoken –“Do You Miss Me Baby? Cause I miss you”
Do you miss me?
