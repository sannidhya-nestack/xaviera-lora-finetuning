As I take a knee, I can hardly breathe
Hope it's the scene you pictured in your dreams
I can see it clear through my happy tears
Just like the sun, you're golden
Shine like a chandelier

My heart
Everything
Let it start
With this ring
Never part
I'm gonna bring
You home forever
With this ring

I can feel you smile as you walk the aisle
The way you wear your white so sugar wild
Today's the day that I get to say
My 24 karat promise heard ‘cross the Milky Way

(Chorus)

It’s a perfect match, on a magic day
I’ve waited all my life just to see the face
of my angel, my sweet twist of fate

I will sing to you when we're 92
And you'll still be the only girl in the room
You got my heart...

(Chorus)
