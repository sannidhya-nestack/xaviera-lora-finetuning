Chasing rainbows
Will you walk with me this time
At the crossroads
Of the worlds of yours and mine

There are dreams that end and dreams that last forever
And it’s hard to know the one thing from another

Chorus:
It's not black and it's not white
It's not left and it's not right
Here I am
On foreign land
At the crossroads
This is what life is all about
But it burns from the inside out
Here we are
So close but far
Chasing Rainbows

Far from home
Don't wanna walk this world alone
Hearing echoes
From a destiny unknown

Sometimes love's the best, sometimes the worst thing ever
Sometimes I'm high, sometimes my head is under water

Chorus.
