EMILY REI

V1
Emily sings all the right words
Shifting and flailing
Man she don’t hang around
Her boys on guitar
Always in her heart
There ain’t no sound like that around
Not in this town!

CHORUS 1
Round your hometown
Round and now
I could be the only thing
That remains in your heart
Oh-whoa-oh Emily Rei
Oh-oh-whoa Emily Rei!

V2
Down to the pier
Hand-in-hand we’re
Trailing the colour only the past could provide
Over the shore
The sunset is sure
To fade the icon in her eyes
Make her feel fine!

CHORUS 2
Round your hometown
Round and now
I could be the only thing
That remains in your heart
Oh-whoa-oh Emily Rei

BRIDGE
Why do you feel
The need to conform?
You could still bloom 
How come nobody told you?

CHORUS 3 (AS BEFORE)
