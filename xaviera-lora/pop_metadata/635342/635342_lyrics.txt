Verse 1
The sun never sets in the summer time
Making waves with the love that binds
The world can see subtle love I find
Breaking down, so hard I try

Chorus
Won't you be mine
Won't you be mine
Won't you be mine
Won't you be mine

Verse 2
Will never regret,    summer love is blind
Until you see that my heart is right
Giving you more, hours passing by
In this fight so hard I try


Chorus
Won't you be mine
Won't you be mine
Won't you be mine
Won't you be mine
