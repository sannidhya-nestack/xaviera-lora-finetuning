TRUTH BE TOLD

Tell me the truth
About the bird that cannot fly
Tell me the truth
About the seed that grew too much
Tell me the truth
About you about her
Tell me the truth
Tell me

Where is the fire?
Where is the beast?
Where is the fire?
Where is the beast?

Tell me the truth
About that broken wrist
Tell me the truth
About that open door

Where is the fire?
Where is the beast?
Where is the fire?
Where is the beast?
