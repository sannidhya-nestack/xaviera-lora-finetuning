CARNIVAL

I fly on the trapeze
The rush puts me at ease
I could slip off the bar
But I feel just like a star
Fairy floss, pastel pink
Never anytime to stop and think
In the end it's soft and sweet
A fleeting life, yet complete 

Fortune teller tell me that I'm fortunate
Strong man make me strong
The lights are too bright at this carnival
But I feel like I belong
		
The glamour and disguise
Will gloss over the lies
Because they'll never know
What goes on behind the show
Acrobats, trampolines
Gypsy ladies dance with tambourines
All we know is what we see
Perception is reality

Fortune teller tell me that I'm fortunate
Strong man make me strong
The lights are too bright at this carnival
But I feel like I belong 
I'm high up on the wire
Above the crowds and hoops of fire
I can fly and forget
I don't need a safety net
Curtain call, final bow
Say goodbye, that's all for now
I can't wait to board that train
There's no constant, only change

Fortune teller tell me that I'm fortunate
Strong man make me strong
The lights are too bright at this carnival
And the crowds can be tough at the carnival
But i feel so alive at the carnival
It's the place where i belong
