Never Say Goodbye

I never thought I’d fall in love at first sight
That was for dreamers on a starry night.
My heart told me, when I looked into your eyes,
We’d never say, “Goodbye.”

When we’re alone and you reach for my hand,
That loving gesture means you understand.
There’s no treasure like being with you
We’ll never say, “Goodbye.” 

Chorus:
If time should try to end our romance,
It wouldn’t have a chance.
You’ll be here, in my heart;
We’ll never be apart.

Sometimes it seems we’re living in a dream,
Moments passing in a rushing stream,
If I could have one fantasy to fill,
I’d make time stand still.

Repeat Chorus:

If I knew this would be our last day,
There’s nothing more I would need to say,
To keep the memory of our love alive;
We’ll never say, “Goodbye.”
We’ll never say, “Goodbye.”
