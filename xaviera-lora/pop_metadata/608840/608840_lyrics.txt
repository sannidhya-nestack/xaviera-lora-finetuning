It was never easy for me.
I was too complicated, over speculated.
Why couldn’t I let things go?
It was never a breeze for you.
You were too regulated, over calculated.
Why didn’t you let things go?

One step closer to the moment
Before I broke your heart
And you tore everything apart.
Move me nearer, stop the motion.
What we had is gone
And everything we know is wrong.

I’m tired of always working 
To not be confused or somewhat abused.
Why did I have to let things go?
You’re always rearranging,
Making sure that you’re not used or 
Slightly amused, why did you let things go?
