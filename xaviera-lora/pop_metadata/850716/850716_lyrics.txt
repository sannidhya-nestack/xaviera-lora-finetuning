When the world acts crazy
Is when I need you the most
When everything gets so busy
And I can barely move my toes
I know it's time to unwind
Leave my wars and worries outside
Plug it in, turn it on
Turn it up, sing-a-long

When the subway gets crowded
And I'm on my way home
It's like my body's surrounded
It's a cue to find my phone
Cause it's time to unwind
Leave the noise and the talking outside
Plug it in, turn it on
Turn it up, sing-a-long

I close my eyes
I'm feeling good
My favorite song plays
And again, I am hooked

"I didn't know I could feel that way
When you kissed me the other day
Suddenly it was a fairytale, oh oh
Made a wish to a shooting star
Now look at us, look at where we are
Livin’ life, like a fairyrtale, oh oh"
Plug it in, turn it on
Plug it in, turn it on, oh oh

When my mind’s unhappy
For reasons I don’t know
I really need something catchy
To get me back into my zone
I know it's time to unwind
Be alone, leave the bad things outside
Plug it in, turn it on
Turn it up, sing-a-long

I close my eyes
I'm feeling good
My favorite song plays
And again, I am hooked

"I didn't know I could feel that way
When you kissed me the other day
Suddenly it was a fairytale, oh oh
Made a wish to a shooting star
Now look at us, look at where we are
Livin’ life, like a fairyrtale, oh oh"
Plug it in, turn it on
Plug it in, turn it on, oh
Plug it in, turn it on
Plug it in, turn it on, oh oh

When a day turns bad
When I’m feeling sad
When it’s all too much
The worst I’ve had

I close my eyes
I'm feeling good
My favorite song plays
And again, I am cured

"I didn't know I could feel that way
When you kissed me the other day
Suddenly it was a fairytale, oh oh
Made a wish to a shooting star
Now look at us, look at where we are
Livin’ life, like a fairyrtale, oh oh"

“Made a wish to a shooting star
Now look at us, look at where we are
Livin’ life, like a fairyrtale, oh oh"
Plug it in, turn it on, oh oh
Plug it in, turn it on
Plug it in, turn it on, oh oh
Plug it in, turn it on
Plug it in, turn it on, oh oh

Plug it in, turn it on
Plug it in, turn it on, oh oh oh
