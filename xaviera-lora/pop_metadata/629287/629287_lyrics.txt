PLEASE

Walk up north
Cross ice and rocks
Cure yourself with stitches made of leaves
Rearrange your point of view
Put yourself back together
Your melted heart
Yeah it's you
Yeah it's me
Yeah it's you
Yeah it's me
Sleep in a comfortable bed
Feel as safe as you can possibly be
But please
Be nice to me
Please be my secret

Tell me your name
Introduce yourself
There's nothing more to say
A meaningful happiness
A delightful oblivion
A meaningful happiness
A delightful oblivion
But please be nice to me
Please be my secret
Meet me late at night
Let's cover ourselves fith fog
Let's hide beneath our words
Meet me late at night
Let's please ourselves with kindness
and gentle toughts...
