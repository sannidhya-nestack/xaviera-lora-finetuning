Everyone Else Is Away

Street are empty 
No one is home
They're in the Hamptons
And I'm all alone
Cause I can't afford a fancy holiday
But the city is mine
Everyone else is away

Traffic flows 
There are places to park
There are no vendors 
Selling their art
And I am in the spotlight
Walking along Broadway
The city is mine
Everyone else is away

Up, down
My feet are rooted underground
East, west
My hempispheres rest beneath the sun and moon
While I sing my tune

The mayor's tired
He left me the key
So come on baby
Come along with me
You can be a star
I'll make you king for a day
The city is mine
Everyone else is away
The city is mine
Everyone else is away
