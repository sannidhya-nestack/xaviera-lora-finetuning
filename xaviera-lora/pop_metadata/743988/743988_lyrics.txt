Oh ooh oh oh 
Got my sunglasses on 
Got my sunglasses on 

Verse 
We started out so right 
B-Blazin hot with kisses 
Temperature was on the rise 
We had it like this 
We had it like this 
I Gave you all my sunshine 
And all the clouds went missin 
Yeah they say that love is blind 
We had it like this 
We had it like this 

Pre 
Then you went and messed it all up 
Guess what I'm done 
Now go get your stuff 
Now you wishin I was the one 
Too bad so sad 
Cuz I'm moving on 

[:: CHORUS::] 
And now that we're done I'll be looking up 
Got my sunglasses on 
Got my sunglasses on 
Days looking brighter since I've been so gone 
Got my sunglasses on 
Got my sunglasses on 

Verse 2 
Coulda been real good 
Like whoa some kinda perfect 
It was cool but it went cold 
Ya got it all wrong 
Ya got it all wrong 
Now I got me a new look 
Rockin shades cuz I'm worth it 
Yeah my future's so bright letting go 
Cuz I got it like that 
I got it like that 

Pre 
Then you went and messed it all up 
Guess what I'm done 
Now go get your stuff now 
Now you wishin I was the one 
Too bad so sad 
Cuz I'm movin on 

[:: CHORUS::] 
And now that we're done I'll be looking up 
Got my sunglasses on 
Got my sunglasses on 
Days looking brighter since I've been so gone 
Got my sunglasses on 
Got my sunglasses on
