THAT PLACE
By Troy Kline and Stephen Rice

Girl take my hand lead me to that place we know 
Where all the world fades away 
Do you recall that place we used to go?
Oh how I wish we could stay

 We were two lovers in paradise That time I do adore
 I'm wanting that some more 'Cause life is such a bore 
Maybe tomorrow we can run away and leave all this behind 
This world is so confined and we need to unwind 

So Girl let's go back to that place we used to go
Where all the world fades away
 Please take me back to that place we used to know 
Oh how I long for that day.
