Mother taught me how to fish with my bare hands,
Whilst brother chops the wood in the square,
My father builds the ships from the forest lowlands,
The fire burns high up in the air,

I'm just waiting for the day when Great Odin says no,
He says Valhalla's not the place for you,
And when Freya walks my way and she stares into my soul,
She says young lady you've got work to do,

I'm made with bone and lust and love,
I'm strong like stone but I move like a dove,
I'm fast like dogs but I fight like the bear,
When I go into her meadow you can meet me there.

I will wear a cloak of burning feathers,
As fast as falcons they will be,
My chariot is strong and it moves like rivers,
No mountain top will try and stop me,
