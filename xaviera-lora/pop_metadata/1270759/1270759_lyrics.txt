[Verse]
I saw your face on my phone screen
A pixelated dream so keen
In digital lands we roam
In cybernetic homes

[Verse 2]
We share emojis like a code
Feelings lost on the upload
Messages blink in the blue
Connections made through and through

[Chorus]
Internetted you and me
Binary love sets us free
Internetted heart so true
WIFI signals straight to you

[Verse 3]
Virtual hugs feel the same
Love in hashtags with your name
Your posts light up my day
In this cybernetic play

[Bridge]
Scrolling through your life online
In your status I find some signs
Profile pictures change like tides
But our link it never hides

[Chorus]
Internetted you and me
Binary love sets us free
Internetted heart so true
WIFI signals straight to you
