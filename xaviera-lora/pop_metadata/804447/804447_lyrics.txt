You're a caveman 
In a nice suit 
When you're angry 
You look so cute 
Gotta nice car 
And a nice voice 
But my friends say you're a bad choice. 
They don't know you 
what you're good at 
With your home slice, 
in your love shack. 
Yeah we party 
And take it farther 
Cuz no one else could party harder. 

You make it hurt 
But still I can't stop. 
You make it work 
And make it so hot. 
You make me feel 
what I should not 

You're the best bad 
 best bad 
You're the best bad idea that I got., that I got. 

You pull me back 
Like a sling shot 
Then I fly 
Until I get caught 
Between your eyes 
I hit the jack pot 

You're the best bad 
 best bad 
You're the best bad idea that I got., that I got. 

You're a time bomb 
About to blow up 
Til you do dude 
Ya Better show up 
Cuz you're go to  
wants her me time  
Every hour better be mine
Cuz your game needs a little frosting 
Get your checkbook 
Cuz it be costing 
A little chump change 
A little cash down 
then you'll hear me sing my sweet sound 

You make it hurt 
But still I can't stop. 
You make it work 
And make it so hot. 
You make me feel 
what I should not 

You're the best bad 
 best bad 
 best bad idea that I got.

You pull me back 
Like a sling shot 
Then I fly 
Until I get caught 
Between your eyes 
I hit the jack pot 

You're the best bad 
 best bad 
Best bad idea that I got

You make it hurt 
But still I can't stop. 
You make it work 
And make it so hot. 
You make me feel 
what I should not 

You're the best bad 
 best bad 
You're the best bad idea that I got., that I got. 

You pull me back 
Like a sling shot 
Then I fly 
Until I get caught 
Between your eyes 
I hit the jack pot 

You're the best bad 
Best Bad 
Best Bad idea that I got.
