There was a time in history 
Your next meal was a mystery 
If you were lucky you might catch a fish 
But we have Amazon now 
No need for brains or brawn now 
Your wish list to your door in just one click 

Pointless productivity 
I sit behind a screen 
My fingers span the inches 
In a blaze of inactivity 
Captivity 
For hours every day 
I dare to call it work 

Relentless innovation 
Requires concentration 
To thrive in this knowledge economy 
My digital creations 
Have no physical manifestation 
I deal in intellectual property 

Our avatars 
In silhouette 
Addicted to 
The internet 
We type and type 
But never sweat 

Our bellies stuffed 
Perpetually 
Defining sloth 
And gluttony 
We die too soon 
But live like kings 

For now let's just enjoy it 
No reason to avoid it 
Who needs an extra gear to coast downhill? 
Succumb, my couch potato 
Adopt my humble credo 
And watch the world revolve while we sit still 

Pointless productivity 
I sit behind a screen 
My fingers span the inches 
In a blaze of inactivity 
Creativity 
I exercise my mind 
And laugh to call it work.
