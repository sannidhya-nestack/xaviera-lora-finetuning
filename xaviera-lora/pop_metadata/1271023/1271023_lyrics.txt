[Verse]
Raindrops on my window
Can't stop the world below
Life just moves so slow
But we grow

[Verse 2]
Sun hides behind the grey
Storms come but they don't stay
Hold tight and find your way
Day by day

[Chorus]
Rain's never in vain
Washing off the pain
We can start again
Together

[Verse 3]
Feel the thunder roll
Let it stir your soul
Every heart's a goal
Make it whole

[Bridge]
Dancing in the puddles
Lost in all life's muddles
Bursting all the bubbles
No more troubles

[Chorus]
Rain's never in vain
Washing off the pain
We can start again
Together
