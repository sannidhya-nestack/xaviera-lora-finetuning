Are these the words you've waited for, stumbling from my mouth?  I never thought I would hold this in so long, breaking every rule I've made.  Breaking down my day by day.

I'm in too deep. I didn't mean to tear you down. I know it's pointless here by now. I cut you off and hoped someday you would understand.  I couldn't wait to feel alive.  I thought I found us in your eyes.  We were so close but lost, we never had a plan.

I roped the moon and pulled it in for you.  Like you, it's cold as hell.  We were so reckless like your roommate's old acoustic.  We were never quite in tune.  You were always too damn loud.

It was the last time I'll come to my senses, the last time I'll stray from these plans. It was the last time I'll come to my senses, the last time I'll stray from these plans.  You were the last I came to my senses, the last time I strayed from these plans. All of the city was backed in the corner pushing themselves to the top. So was I.
