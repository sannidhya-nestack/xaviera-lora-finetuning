WHAT IF

He will feed you with reasonable thought
He will cuddle with you as if you meant a lot
What if a dark cloud wouldn't get you lost
What if you twist your foot in a hole
But if feels like being softly hold
You will look through your fingers
Not to let the light shine
He will catch you if you accidentally fall
He will kindly reward you with a call
Ask yourself would a change would that be
The landscape is passing by
You banged your head you screamed and cried
You felt finally high
The landscape is passing by
You banged your head you screamed and cried
You felt finally high
Everything started with a fall
Everything started with a fall
