I'm all alone, I'm on my own,
I'm all alone, I'm on my own,
I'm trying to find my way back home,
I'm all alone, I'm on my own,

There's a paradise in our hearts we can't touch with our hands,
try to grasp it, it falls like you're clutching the sand,
close your eyes, capture the thought, delve into a land,
where our souls soar the heavens and our hearts understand,
the essence of man, the reason we have these wings that flap but don't lift us up from the land,
there must be a plan, there's a reason, I know,
to bestow us with wings when we're still stuck here below,
stuck in the snow like a truck with a load
that groans under the weight that won't leave it alone,
a goldfish overgrown, gave the sea for a bowl,
on your own but still unwilling to be overthrown,
dont let go, though the truth's loud in your ears,
you ignore your mountain of fear, it's drowned out by beer,
you cheer but crave home as the years disappear,
not dying, not flying, just a fountain of tears.

There's something on my mind,
something I can't describe,
something I'm trying to find,
one the inside,
but it's not there.

I want much more than 'nice', a life within limit,
a life that's predictable from start to finish,
a life that's bounded by boundaries binding your image,
where visions and dreams drop down, die, drown, diminish,
I want much more than a generation of whiners,
minors who sing their songs solo in minor,
a generation of ever-empty hearts holed at the base,
whose flow of life can be traced from spoons for a coffee grinder,
I want much more than the American Dream,
though the ideal seems ideal please believe if it were deemed enough,
there wouldn't be so many broken hearts, souls, households and families,
I want more than a skeleton in a red summer dress,
chasing what is already taken by something less,
I want more than scarlet scars on blood red, this bloodshed
that we call love, if it is, I'm sick of love then.

There's something on my mind,
something I can't describe,
something I'm trying to find,
one the inside,
but it's not there.

I'm lost on the road, but I know,
that you are watching out,
but my cross, it grows old,
and I'm fallin down,

I've lost all control, now you're cold,
I'm desperately in doubt,
what's the cost of my soul?
it's calling out,

I've lost all control, now you're cold,
I'm desperately in doubt,
what's the cost of my soul?
it's calling out!

I'm all alone, I'm on my own,
I'm all alone, I'm on my own,
I'm trying to find my way back home,
I'm all alone, I'm on my own,
