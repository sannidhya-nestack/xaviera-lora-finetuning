SMOKE FILLED AIR

Nothings going on tonight
Dark shadows cut through the light
There you are
Sitting over there in the smoke filled air

You always come here alone
Right about half past nine
Scotch on the rocks
And take your place reserved for you

CHORUS
You could be just a guy 
but theres a sight Ive yet to see
Are you washing your hands
Are you washing them clean
What do you do
Where do you go 
When you are not here
Sitting over there in the smoke filled air 

Nothings going on tonight
Your face is all I see through the night
Your standing there alone
Your intention is unknown

CHORUS
You could be just a guy 
but theres a sight Ive yet to see
Are you washing your hands
Are you washing them clean
What do you do
Where do you go 
When you are not here
Sitting over there in the smoke filled air
