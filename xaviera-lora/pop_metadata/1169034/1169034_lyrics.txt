STRONGER BECAUSE OF YOU


VERSE 1

Lookin’ back on a million memories made
Can’t help but smile at our Beautiful yesterdays
Not even time could take that away

CHORUS

Who knows where this road will lead
But as long as you’re here with me
I ‘m gonna face it - I’m gonna make it
Knowing you’ll be there too
I can hold on longer
I know I’m Stronger 
Stronger because of you

VERSE 2

Should my sky fall - you’ll pick me up again
There’s no forever - you won’t be welcome in
Wherever I’m goin - wherever been

BRIDGE 
The laughter - the tears - through the trials and the years
Through the heartaches we've endured - love lives on forevermore
