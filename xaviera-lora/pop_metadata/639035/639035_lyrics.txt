Promised Land


I can see that times are changing
And I know it’s in our hands                              
Looking for a destination
Destination is the promised land

All around these walls are crumbling
Every day we hide our tears
People want to find an answer
And the answer is plain and clear

Oh Oh 
I’m still a believer
Oh Oh 
Yes I am
Oh Oh 
I’ll keep on reaching for that promised land

I can feel there’s trouble coming
Find a way, don’t light the fuse
This is real, so no more playing
I’ll be fighting to break on through

Many roads have led to nowhere                        
All those dreams and wasted plans                 
Looking for some inspiration
Inspiration in the promised land

Oh Oh 
I’m a believer
Oh Oh 
Yes I am
Oh Oh 
I’ll keep on searching for that promised land 
For that promised land

Oh Oh 
I’m still a believer
Oh Oh 
Yes I am
Oh Oh 
I’ll keep on reaching for that promised land
Find the promised land
Find that promised land
