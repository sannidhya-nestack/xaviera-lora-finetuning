Things From The Past


I gotta keep on moving
yeah i'll keep on moving
i'll try, to understand all my feelings

well im regretting the misunderstandings 
and im,growing up while i learn

and the answers are clear to me
so as long as we cant, share the same ground

no i won't forget
all that we've been through now i 
see so clearly, so as long as we're friends
we won't see each other anymore

different phases are we wasting our words away
for a worthless case, but life
taught me to believe in everything i feel
no i, i can´t take the risk

i know
and the answers are clear to me
yeah i know that we can't, share the same ground

'cause i won't turn back
to all that we've been through now i 
see so clearly, so as long as we're friends
we won't see each other anymore

i'll forget i believe 
that i am healing deep inside you'll say
you´re so closed, there's no meaning
and there's nothing you can do

'cause i won't turn back
to all that we've been through now i'm 
letting go, so as long as we're friends
we won't see each other anymore
