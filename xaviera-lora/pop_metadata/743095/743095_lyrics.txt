Flatline 

I hear you calling out from the darkness (x3)
I'm coming back from the dead

Walking down the street you live 
Taking the chance you will be home
It's been so long since our last kiss
Can't do this on my own

I need you to breathe 
Bring me back to life
My heart needs you to beat 
Save me from the light
Don't let me flatline

Don't let me flatline (x2)

I've been so reckless with hearts
All I cared about was my own 
I would die to get back the sparks
I'll never let you go

I need you to breathe 
Bring me back to life
My heart needs you to beat 
Save me from the light
Don't let me flatline

Don't let me flatline (x2)

I hear you calling out from the darkness
I'm coming back from the dead (x2) 

I need you to breathe (x2)

I need you to breathe
Bring me back to life
My heart needs you to beat 
Save me from the light
Don't let me flatline

Don't let me flatline (x2)
