You and Me

Baby it's just you and me out on the dance floor
Feels like I'm flying, I'm higher, I want more
Baby it's just you and me and I want to go now 
So for one night, you're all mine, let's make it loud

So tell me you don't want to see how it goes down 
Baby pull me close and get my feet up off the ground 
I don't need no drama, I need you baby 
Just you and me

I just need you for one night
Just this one night
Can you be my fantasy cause baby it ain't hard to see 
Your eyes, to see your eyes
Baby you've been tempting me and all I need is one night
One night, one night woah

Baby it's just you and me, this is our moment
See the fire in your eyes, this is real, no disguise
Just you and me when nobody's watching
So baby come on, they're playing our song

So tell me you don't want to see how it goes down 
Baby pull me close and get my feet up off the ground 
I don't need no drama, I need you baby 
Just you and me

I just need you for one night
Just this one night
Can you be my fantasy cause baby it ain't hard to see 
Your eyes, to see your eyes
Baby you've been tempting me and all I need is one night
One night, one night woah

You and me and
You and me and 
You and me and
Out on the dance floor 
You and me and 
You and me and
You and me and 

So tell me you don't want to see how it goes down 
Baby pull me close and get my feet up off the ground 
I don't need no drama, I need you baby 
Just you and me

I just need you for one night
Just this one night
Can you be my fantasy cause baby it ain't hard to see 
Your eyes, to see your eyes
Baby you've been tempting me and all I need is one night

Just this one night
Can you be my fantasy cause baby it ain't hard to see
Your eyes, to see you eyes 
Baby you've been tempting me and all I need is one night
One night, one night, one night
