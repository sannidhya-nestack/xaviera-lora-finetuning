Blind, When you’re on my mind 
you can see the signs 
it ain’t hard to find one 
I tend to close my eyes 
and I’m paralyzed 
conversation dies 
so now you know I love you so 
and I got this ache 
I might break over 
how I never talk to you 
and you never even knew my name 
and it rains and it rains down 

Hook:
Some day when the lights fade 
and the nights make 
all the hearts break 
you will be with me 
you will come to see 
you can’t stand to be 
without me never doubt me 
I’m your one love one love 
quote me someday you’ll see 
I’m your one love one love baby baby 

Vs. 2
Now I can feel the pain 
I can see your face 
and I just need a taste 
don’t know where I’m goin wrong 
why won’t you come along 
know it could take a long time 
Now you know now you know 
that I love you so love you 
and I got this ache 
I might break over 
how I never talk to you 
and you never even knew my name 
and it rains and it rains down 

Hook:
Some day when the lights fade 
and the nights make 
all the hearts break 
you will be with me 
you will come to see 
you can’t stand to be
 without me never doubt me 
I’m your one love one love 
quote me someday you’ll see 
I’m your one love one love
 baby baby
