I watch you in the rain
hiding by the bench
by the house where we stayed
You know i'm still there
you know i'm watching

you know what love is
it's just like air, just like the air you breathe

A basic necessity


i search for signs in the night
hiding by the bed
where I held on to be kissed
You know I'm still there
You know I love you

kiss me and we'll go away
bound by my nothingness
kill me so i can remain
bound by my own sadness


I watch you walking to the train
thinking i'm all done now
by the flower shop 
You see me behind the window
just a nod behind the shadow


you know what love is
it's just like the soul, the soul that you've been keeping

A basic necessity

I whisper through the day
the night it's a song of love
by my wandering soul
you might leave today
but i'm stuck beyond life
