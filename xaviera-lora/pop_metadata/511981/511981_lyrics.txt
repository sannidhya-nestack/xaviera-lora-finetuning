Can I 
Hold you 
Once more 
Once more

Can I
Touch you 
Once more
Once more

Can I taste your lips
With my fingertips, can I...
Can I taste your lips...

I will 
Love you
Always, 
Always
And I will 
Be with you
Always
Always... 

Can I 
Tell you 
Once more 
Once more

How you've changed me
How your love has made me
Someone 
Better than I was before

I'm who I want to be 		
I'm where I want to be	
With you I want to be

I will 
Love you
Always, 
Always
And I will 
Be with you
Always
Always... 

There’s so much that I long to say
But nothing that I have to say
Compares with what I’m about to say
To you love, you love

I will 
Love you
Always, 
Always
And I will 
Be with you
Always
Always...
