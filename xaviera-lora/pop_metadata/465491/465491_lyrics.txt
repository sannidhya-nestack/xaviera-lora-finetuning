A breezy morning bathed in pastel light
The fluffy clouds race home and it's like

The love kite's taking us far into the sky
The love kite's flying us high up in the sky

A rain drenched window in the afternoon
Washline clothes flapping cheerfully 

The love kite's taking us far into the sky
The love kite's flying us high up in the sky

Warm tones of sunset and it's twilight
Birds race home to bed and it's like

The love kite's taking us far into the sky
The love kite's flying us high up in the sky

Stars under the blanket of night
A dream tumbling in lazy flight

The love kite's taking us far into the sky
The love kite's flying us high up in the sky
