[Verse]
Morning sun rise anew
Plans we make just us two
Days ahead we will do
Every dream coming true

[Verse 2]
Side by side hand in hand
Build a life understand
Moments we’ve carefully planned
On this solid love we stand

[Chorus]
Life plans with you oh it's bright
Loving you feels so right
Every day every night
Life plans take flight

[Verse 3]
Laugh and cry just the same
In this love is no shame
Playing life like a game
We’ve got the winner's name

[Bridge]
Forever us forevermore
Every step we’ll explore
Heart to heart like before
Life full never a bore

[Chorus]
Life plans with you oh it's bright
Loving you feels so right
Every day every night
Life plans take flight
