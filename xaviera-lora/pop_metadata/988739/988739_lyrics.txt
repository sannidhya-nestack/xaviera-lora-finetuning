Verse:
Mixin’ my own drinks
Keep it strong, try not to think
Wearing that dress that I know you like cause....

Pre-C:
I only came here to see if I would see you
I ended up in a state I didn’t mean to
Waking up in the morning dizzy, I’m hungover

Chorus:
Was I saying things that aren’t true
Was I doing things I shouldn’t do 
Was I doing it all, doing it all
Cause I’m mad at you
Was I drinking enough for two
Was I dancing with some other dude
Was I doing it all, doing it all
Cause I’m mad at you
Yeah, I’m mad at you 

Verse 2: 
Your name on my phone
Asking if I made it home
I didn’t think before I told you

Pre-C2:
I only went there to see if I would see you
I ended up in a state I didn’t mean to
I woke up in the morning and you never came over 

Chorus:
Was I saying things that aren’t true
Was I doing things I shouldn’t do 
Was I doing it all, doing it all
Cause I’m mad at you
Was I drinking enough for two
Was I dancing with some other dude
Was I doing it all, doing it all
Cause I’m mad at you
Yeah, I’m mad at you 

Bridge:
And I’m sorry I get caught up in the stupid things 
I only went there to see if I would see you
I ended up in a state I didn’t mean to....

Last Chorus:
Say things that aren’t true
Or do things I shouldn’t do
I was doing it all, doing it all
Cause I was mad at you
Was I drinking enough for two
Was I dancing with some other dude
I was doing it all, doing it all
Cause I was mad at you
Just mad at you
