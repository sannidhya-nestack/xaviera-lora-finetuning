Alive in Your Love

  I was drifting out at sea 
When you took a hold of me
 Pulled me onto solid ground
  Looking up into your face  
My heart began to race 
Love would never let me drown  

Chorus
 I could breathe you in 
Never give you up
 Be my oxygen 
Alive in your love  

Ever since I've been with you
 Days are bright, skies are blue 
Feel a sweetness everywhere  
Every night you hold me close 
Giving me another dose of  what I need to live, more than air  

Chorus
 I could breathe you in
 Never give you up 
Be my oxygen 
Alive in your love

  Bridge 
When life says no, love says yes
 And I will always do my best 
To make you laugh and smile that smile 
The one that makes me loose my breath  

Chorus 
I could breathe you in
 Never give you up
 Be my oxygen
 Alive in your love
