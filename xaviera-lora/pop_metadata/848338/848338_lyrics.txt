SOMEWHERE NEAR YOU

Couplet 1:			I don't need phonecalls
				I don't need reasons tonight
				why I should go home

				I don't need planning
				I don't need logic, cause I
				know it never shows…
	
Pre-chorus:		where I wanna go, wanna go now
				where I wanna be, wanna be now
				'Cause I wanna stay, wanna stay now
				somewhere near you

Couplet 2:			I don't need something 
				to make me believe that it's wrong
				what we're doing now

				I don't need someone or anyone
				pointing at me 
				when I hide in crowd

Pre-chorus:		Cause I wanna go, wanna go now
				where I wanna be, wanna be now
				Yes I wanna stay, wanna stay now
				without judgement sticking around you for the night

Bridge:			now should we find ourselves spinning backwards
				choosing a right kind of wrong
				should we give up for age really matters 
				while empty numbers are dumb
				no I do not expect no answers
				and I don't need no reasons why
				I sincerely need no understanding, 
				cause tonight we're drifting away from time. 

Chorus/Outro:		I don't wanna know, wanna know now
				where I gotta go gotta go now
				cause I wanna stay wanna stay now
				somewhere near you.
