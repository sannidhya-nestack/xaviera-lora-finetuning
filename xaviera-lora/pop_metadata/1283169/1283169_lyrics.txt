She has a perfect smile and it's honest
She goes the extra mile and it's obvious
She doesn't need to fake it for an audience
And girls like her don't come around very often
It's not hard to think that she could be the one
That I've prayed for since I was young
As we get closer, it's obvious to us
So I pray for all that's to come
Dear God, help me be the man
Who loves and protects her
I pray that I will give my life
To faithfully serve her
I never imagined I could be so blessed
With all of her affection
I probably don't deserve
She's the greatest person I have ever known
Thank you God for all that you have done
She has the greatest laugh and it's contagious
She always walks by faith and is blameless
And in the face of fear, she's courageous
It's not hard to think that she could be the one
That I've prayed for since I was young
As we get closer, it's obvious to us
So I pray for all that's to come
Dear God, help me be the man
Who loves and protects her
I pray that I will give my life
To faithfully serve her
I never imagined I could be so blessed
With all of her affection
I probably don't deserve
She's the greatest person I have ever known
Thank you God for all that you have done
My bride, you are more than enough
My love, I'll give you all my trust
My bride, you are more than enough
My love, I'll give you all my trust
Dear God, help me be the man
Who loves and protects her
I pray that I will give my life
To faithfully serve her
I never imagined I could be so blessed
With all of her affection
I probably don't deserve
She's the greatest person I have ever known
Thank you God for all that you have done
I never imagined I could be so blessed
With all of your affection
I probably don't deserve
You're the greatest person I have ever known
