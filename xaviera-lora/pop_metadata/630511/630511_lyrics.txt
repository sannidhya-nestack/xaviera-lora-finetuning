I’ve Cried A Little (Café Bleu Mix)


Since you went away
Oh I’ve cried a little
Guess I’ve cried a lot

And I work to hide the pain                           
Yeah eh, I try a little
Guess I try a lot

Every day, every night
Every day, every night I keep fighting through
But thing’s don’t improve

There’s something missing in my life
It’s all because, because of you

When I hear our song
Oh I smile a little
Guess I smile a lot

All those good times in the sun
Baby we laughed a little
Yes we laughed a lot

Every beat of my heart
Every beat of my heart beats in double time
For a love that’s died

It’s clouding everything I do
It’s all because, because of you

Every day, every night
Every day, every night I keep fighting through
But thing’s don’t improve

There’s something missing in my life
It’s all because, because of you
It’s all because, because of you
