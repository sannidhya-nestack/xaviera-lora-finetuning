BECOMING ONE  
© Anna Neradilkova, Anikiko 

Three hours til the sun comes up
Another sleepless night
Will I make it through another day 
Walking the tight rope to my dreams

I gotta find a way to open the gates 
And call sweet angels to communicate
To tell dark demons that keep me awake 
To stop calling my name


PC
I close my eyes let sweet angels sing 
Drown out the shadows I’ve been sleeping in  

I dream of becoming one with these worlds
I dream of becoming one x2

A dripping tap swallows the gap
My only friend
Sweet Music paves a narrow escape 
Through the starless nights

I've been watching shadows dance on my walls
Relieved, they fade as the new sun calls
Chimes pirouette in the breeze
That’s when the rainbows tip toe in
 
If listen close an keep real still
Maybe they‘ll show me 
I don’t need no pill
 
CH

There’s a place where worlds collide
You can touch your dreams
Sparks in your heart ignite
Angels take demons by the hands 
Till they sway in there own sweet romance
Painting rainbows and laughing
