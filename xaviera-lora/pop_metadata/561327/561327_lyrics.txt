A million questions I asked myself today
I tried to find a reason to make you stay
I couldn't seem to find the words
I thought that I needed to say
Or maybe I just didn't want to take the time
To think about it today

      Take my heart, take my soul
      Lock them up and take control
      Take a deep breath, turn around & look at me
      Could I be the man of all your dreams?
      The man of all your dreams

Now I'm not sure how I feel inside
Are you the one or would you break my pride?
I've never ever been so lost
I've never been so confused
Or maybe I am worried what you would say
If I told you this today

      I'll take your heart, take your soul
      Lock them up and take control
      I'll take a deep breath turn around & look at you
      Could you be the girl of all my dreams?
      The girl of all my dreams
