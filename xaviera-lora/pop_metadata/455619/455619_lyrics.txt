I Dream About You  
   
Verse 1
I  got brain freeze slo-motion, can’t get you out of my mind
I wanna tell you but the words are so hard to find 
I got a little secret I cannot  keep 
I love you even in my sleep
 	
Chorus
And dream about you
Am I dreaming the impossible dream?
When I dream about you
‘Cos there’s no way a dream like you 
Could ever come true 

Verse 2 
Now it’s a variation on an old theme,
I love you, you don’t even see me 
I’m a  birthday ballon ready to burst on your scene  
Jut pop me, cos’ all I ever get to do is

Chorus
Dream about you
Beautiful dreamer I see you and me
When I  dream about you
When I close my eyes I dream about how sweet it could be

Bridge
I  play make believe a little
When you dream of love
I’m in the middle of it all
I stretch the story twist and spin it
If only for another minute

Chorus

I can Dream about you
Hurry Mr Sandman bring me my dream
I dream about you
Fiction’s not always as strange as it seems

So I dream about you, ‘cos I’m a dreamer
I’m still dreaming about you
‘Cos sometimes dreams do come true
