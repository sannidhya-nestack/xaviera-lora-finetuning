Who is it, who is it in
Why did you do it, what is it to it
Maybe I blew it
Who is it, who is it in
Why did you do it, Maybe I blew it
what is it to it

Frozen people all around
They summoned me
I’ll have no memories, I’ll wonder who you’ll be 
They’ve got their eyes on you

Who is it, who is it in
Why did you do it, what is it to it
Maybe I blew it
Who is it, who is it in
Why did you do it, Maybe I blew it
what is it to it
