Try to pretend I care and listen to what she says. 
I wanna go even though we just got here. 
Feel like I waste her time, feel like I´m wasting mine. 
It ain't her fault I know, but shes just not her. 

What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for? 
Waiting for that final day, but it doesn't work that way.
 What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for? 
Guess it doesn't work that way. 

There comes a time, there comes a day.
 Everythings fine, all is OK. It's not today, but I´m on my way. 
Never enough, keep moving on. 
Don't know how much, don't know how long. 
It's not today, but I´m on my way. 

Everyone says move on, everyone says she's gone. 
I don't want to hear but they keep on talking. 
Taking it day by day, try not to drift away. 
I'll get there one day so I´ll keep on walking

What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for?
Keys and boxes everywhere. Didn't plan to end up here. 
What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for? 
Didn't plan to end up here. 

There comes a time, there comes a day. 
Everythings fine, all is OK. 
It's not today, but I´m on my way. 
Never enough, keep moving on. 
Don't know how much, don't know how long. 
It's not today, but I´m on my way.
