Sailing high seas through the storm
My ship wrecked on the shore
So lost here alone
So lost here alone
I'm a castaway

I had a girl back home
Now I sleep alone
I took for granted the life
that we made

I complicated
A simple love song
Was a king but
Threw it all away
I can't feel
Anything's that's real

Sailing high seas through the storm
My ship wrecked on the shore
So lost here alone
So lost here alone
I'm a castaway

No mans an island
But im surviving
Just holding on
To the love that we had
Gotta get back to you
Girl im going mad
Take a chance give me faith
I will show you
How I feel you are all that's real

Sailing high seas through the storm
My ship wrecked on the shore
So lost here alone
So lost here alone
I'm a castaway
I'm a castaway
I'm a castaway
Castaway
You feel like a storm
The rage and then the calm Sailing high seas through the storm
My ship wrecked on the shore
So lost here alone
So lost here alone
I'm a castaway
