girl you walked right into my life 
it was dark then you were my light 
and right away a brighter day it came now you're ripping my heart out 
I died when you walked out walked out the door 

I need you more and girl I just can't be without you 
can't see without you can't breathe without you 
What am I supposed to do baby I'm flipping out I'm going crazy 
I don't know what to do I cannot go without you baby 
you are my one and only lady I won't find no one like you all my life 
I was searching for you and now you're gone what do I do
