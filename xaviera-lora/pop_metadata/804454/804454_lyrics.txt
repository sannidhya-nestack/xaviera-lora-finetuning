We going out to get it 
Here's a heads up 
We untouchable. 
So down with lights off 
But we got the beat on
We gonna drop it low. 
Do you wanna know a secret 
But can you keep it 
keep to yourself. 
Don't let nobody creep it 
Baby just bleep it 
tell no one else 

We are freaking BRIGHT hot 
Us ladies know what we got 
Roll it once 
Roll it twice  
You might just hit the jack pot 

We don't care for the day 
We just blow it away. 
We living for the night fall, 
Last call, 
that's all. 
In our neighboorhood
We don't care for the change (cha-change)
We just doing our thing (Our thing) 
We looking out to get some, 
get dumb, 
we numb. 
In our neighborhood. 
in our neighborhood. 

We cruising on the main street 
Like you know me.  
We unstoppable. 
Raise it for the homies
who really know me 
fill it up some more 

We are freaking BRIGHT hot 
Us ladies know what we got 
Roll it once 
Roll it twice  
You might just hit the jack pot 

We don't care for the day 
We just blow it away. 
We living for the night fall, 
Last call, 
that's all. 
In our neighboorhood
We don't care for the change (cha-change)
We just doing our thing (Our thing) 
We looking out to get some, 
get dumb, 
we numb. 
In our neighborhood. 
in our neighborhood.
