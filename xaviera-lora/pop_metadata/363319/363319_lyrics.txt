Ain't it funny how it all becomes clear
sometimes it happens, you can see the snow is falling
and then I slip into my cloudy daydream
and i don't have control 'cos you got a hold on me

Chorus:
and now I'm spending all my thinking time
don't wanna go back to my day to day
a hush has fallen like a curtain opens up a scene
and your my beatiful distraction

I can picture you in my mind
just need to sit there while the music's playing in my eyes
no rhyme or reason, it can come at anytime
I hope I've got enough to keep you by my side

Chorus
Verse 1
