Every day’s a struggle
When you’re on the downslide
Getting into trouble is a way of life
All the time you’re fighting
And you want to escape
Just about surviving, need to find your way

Light and darkness
You’re somewhere in between Getting restless
Something to believe

You’re falling and calling
You’re hanging in mid air
Try to stay strong; keep flying on a wing and a prayer
You’re waiting and taking small steps, not getting there
Now your time has come, keep flying on a wing and a prayer

Every day’s a battle when you take a wrong turn 
Running up that steep hill, seems you never learn 
Still believing things will work out right
Strongest feeling, looking down the line

You’re falling and calling, still hanging in mid air
Try to stay strong; keep flying on a wing and a prayer
You’re waiting and taking small steps, not getting there
Now your time has come, keep flying on a wing and a prayer 
Your time has come, keep flying on a wing and a prayer 
Your time has come, flying on a wing and a prayer
A wing and a prayer
