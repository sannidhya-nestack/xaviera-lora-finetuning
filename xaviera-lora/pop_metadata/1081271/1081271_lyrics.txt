The road’s long or so it seems
Every mile’s full of internet memes
I look out of the window breeze full of dreams
Never wish to be away it hurts my soul seams


It’s sunny where you are
The clouds just make the light flower
It’s sunny where you are
The rains just make the rainbow fuller

The dirive’s never ending or so I feel
Every toll gate takes such a deal
Of time when all I need is you, that’s what’s real
I need to soak up the sunshine and heal

Being patient was not my way
Tapping my fingers on the tray
I just say come what may
I”m headed into your zone and day
