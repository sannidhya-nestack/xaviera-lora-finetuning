Getaway
© Penny Towers Wilber



I want a Hayride
Not a high rise
I want to fly high with you
in the country side
where we can hide.

I want a spring day
Not a subway
I want a snow storm in june
in the countryside
I need a sleigh ride.

(We'll getaway)
The heart of the city
(We'll play)
is colder than ice
(We will stay)
Here in the country
it's cold but it's nice

To see a sunrise on the mountain side
feel the wind blowing in your face
A getaway where we can play
I want a hay ride I need a sleigh ride
in the country side.
