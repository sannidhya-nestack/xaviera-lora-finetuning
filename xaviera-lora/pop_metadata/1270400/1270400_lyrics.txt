[Verse]
Streetlights shining bright
City comes alive tonight
Whispers in the cool air
Every moment feels so rare

[Verse 2]
Sneaking through the dark
Hearts racing like a spark
Mystery around us swirlin'
Feels like the world is twirlin'

[Chorus]
Meet you after hours babe
Where dreams never fade
In the shadows we unite
Lost in electric light

[Verse 3]
Time stands still with you
No secrets just the truth
Every step a heartbeat
Midnight love feels so sweet

[Bridge]
In this night so deep
Promises we keep
Hold me close don't let go
Under stars our love will grow

[Chorus]
Meet you after hours babe
Where dreams never fade
In the shadows we unite
Lost in electric light
