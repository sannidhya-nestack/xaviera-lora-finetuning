Verse:

A woman's on the corner looking quiet forlorn
You stop to offer help as her jacket's rather worn
You think you know her as you look into her face
A troubled soul, you're familiar with her case
You get your wallet out, squinting in the sun
When you can see again, you're looking down a gun

Verse:

You spot him standing there tall dark and cool
He shows you some white powder, and says meet me by the pool
Why not just try it, fit into the group
Your mind's on fire, will it throw you for a loop
You never do this, it's a one time caprice
But just as you take over, he says he's the police

Chorus:

Wouldn't you know it, it's happened again
Wouldn't you know it, I thought we were friends
Wouldn't you know it, I played it just so
Wouldn't you know it, I just had to go

Bridge:

I't all around you, it's going to get worse
Your timing's dreadful, it seems so perverse
Life is so maddening, you try to break free
But wouldn't you know it, it happening to me

Verse:

It's always out there hanging like a presence
Screwing up your tempo, feeling like a menace
My timing is dreadful it's so perverse
But it always stays with me just like I've been cursed
Wouldn't you know it, it's happened to me
Wouldn't you know it, I can't break free

Chorus Out
