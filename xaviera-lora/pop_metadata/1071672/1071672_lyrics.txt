VERSE
Pulled the collar up against my neck
See you here in every breath
Showing me a warmer place to be
I’ve been walking for a lifetime
And with all the things I’ve seen
You’re still the one I’m after
When I’m following my dreams

CHORUS
I may be gone a little while 
But I’ll always come back to you
Even when my thoughts are running wild 
They always come back to you

VERSE 2
Keep a fire burning, keep the faith my darling
Keep an eye out for some kind of sign
‘cause when I finish all this business
then with God as my witness
you’ll get what you’ve been wishing for
and you’ll get it right on time

CHORUS
I may be gone a little while 
But I’ll always come back to you
Even when my thoughts are running wild 
They always come back to you
And you know it’s coming true
I’ll always come back to you

BRIDGE
When that lonesome whistle blows
And my soul is wearing thin
These old walking shoes
Always know the way
Back to you

CHORUS
I may be gone a little while 
But I’ll always come back to you
Even when my thoughts are running wild 
They always come back to you
And you know this much is true
I’ll always come back to you
