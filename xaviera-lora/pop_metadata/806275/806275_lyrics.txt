It's Hot 
Like Cherry Pie in the morning 
Make me laugh 
never ever boring
Just be real 
Cuz your smiles fake 
And it will lead to your heart-break. 
You're into me 
And I am into you 
But don't get cocky or you'll be the fool 
Too Cool for school, 
Don't be a Tool, 
Cuz I want you like I'm 13
gonna make a scene   

I heart you 
I heart you 
I <3 You 
I heart you 
I heart you 
I <3 You 
XOXO Baby

Its not, 
Like things were back in the day 
And don't get it twisted if I call you my Bae
Love Me 
Hate Me 
I'll drive you crazy 
Cuz I'm that boss chic baby 
I like this 
And you like that 
Treat me like a queen 
Or I'll talk fact 
Not smack 
Get on a track 
cuz it's time for our come back 

I heart you 
I heart you 
I <3 You 
I heart you 
I heart you 
I <3 You
