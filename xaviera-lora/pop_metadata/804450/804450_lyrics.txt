I feel the dawn of what's to be 
I feel my heart skip a beat 
Oh no 
Look around of what was mine 
I look at you dead between the eyes 
Did you do this to me
Did I do this to myself 

It's all insane the lengths you'll play 
to give a name to your cold blooded game
Or Am I to blame I let you stay 
I gave a name to your cold blooded game 

I feel the dawn of what's to be I feel like I'm lost at sea I can't believe what you have done
I turned my back on what was mine 
To you this was justified
Just a pawn in your game 
You feel alive when I'm about to die
You stole and keep stealing me now 
It was all in vain

It's all insane the lengths you'll play 
to give a name to your cold blooded game
Or Am I to blame I let you stay 
I gave a name to your cold blooded game 

The countdown started its 123-1234 
The countdowns started to open to 
Walk out that door 
Or I won't survive 
I won't live to tell your lies 
I better open my eyes this is the time 

It's all insane the lengths you'll play 
to give a name to your cold blooded game
Or Am I to blame I let you stay 
I gave a name to your cold blooded game 

Its a cold-blooded game
Its a cold-blooded game 
its love
