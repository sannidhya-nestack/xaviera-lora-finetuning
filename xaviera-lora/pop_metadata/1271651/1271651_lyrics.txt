[Verse]
City lights below me
As we soar up high
Touching dreams and catching stars
In the endless sky

[Verse 2]
Clouds are dancing close now
They whisper your name
In this fleeting moment
Everything's the same

[Chorus]
Window seat takes me far
To where the heart belongs
Journey on with open eyes
Singing silent songs

[Verse 3]
Sunrise paints the morning
With a golden hue
Colors weave a tapestry
Of our skies in view

[Bridge]
Up above the worries fade
Troubles left behind
In this world of endless blue
Peace is what we find

[Verse 4]
Landing lights are closer
City waking up
Memories and dreams we've shared
Filling up our cup
