[Verse]
Sky so blue so bright
We ride the waves tonight
Stars like diamonds high
Your hand in mine we fly

[Verse 2]
Ocean's gentle sway
We dance in night and day
Laugh and drift away
In dreams we always play

[Chorus]
Dream surfing with you
Under skies so new
Dream surfing all night
Everything feels right

[Verse 3]
Moonlight guides us there
Floating through the air
In this world so fair
Forever lost no care

[Verse 4]
Endless sea of dreams
Nothing's as it seems
In your eyes it gleams
We sail on golden streams

[Chorus]
Dream surfing with you
Under skies so new
Dream surfing all night
Everything feels right
