When I'm standing near you I can't get my words out 
Like I fear you, being in your shadow 
How you magnetise.. 
While you're lighting fires 
While you're lighting fires 
While you're lighting fires 

All the pictures that I had inside my head 
Lie undeveloped like a roll of film lies 
Undiscovered... 
While you're lighting fires 
While you're lighting fires 
While you're lighting fires
When I'm standing near you I can't get my words out 
Like I fear you, being in your shadow 
How you magnetise.. 
While you're lighting fires
