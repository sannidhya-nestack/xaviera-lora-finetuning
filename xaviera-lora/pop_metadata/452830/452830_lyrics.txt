When you’re lost in space
with no place to land
you see in every face
a friend who’ll understand
but behind that warm, sunny atmosphere
was the coldest place
where it all came clear:
There is poison
beneath the purest ground
It makes me feel
like a rocket slowing down

You can’t get away
You can just pretend
you’re not getting pulled
into the wheels again
If you lose your faith
to a dead-end track
will you waste your life
trying to get it back?
There’s no decisions to be made
when you play it safe and sound
I can look brand new
but I’ll feel like a rocket slowing down
I got to fly for a while
in a sky so blue
I got to make you smile
and though I wanted to
I could not touch down,
and now I drift in space
but I can’t seem to home in 
on a different face.
          
What I had was gone
before I had the time to turn around
and now I feel 
like a rocket slowing down
