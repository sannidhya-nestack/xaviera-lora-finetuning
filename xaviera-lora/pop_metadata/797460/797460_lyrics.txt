Verse 1

Breaking out of these chains
I feel you running through my veins
Silhouettes painted on the floor
Stepping on roses by the door

Pre Chorus

It’s getting hard to breathe 
Now your controlling me
One touch is ecstasy every time
I feel it rushing in
I feel you on my skin
I don’t know where you been

Chorus

We could do this all day
I’m coming for ya
So come on baby press play
I know you want it
I could do this all day
I’m coming for ya
So come on baby press play
I know you want it

Verse 2

Breaking out of these heels
The way you making me feel
Shadows written on the wall
And I’ve been waiting so long

Pre Chorus

It’s getting hard to breathe 
Now your controlling me
One touch is ecstasy every time
I feel it rushing in
I feel you on my skin
I don’t know where you been

Chorus

We could do this all day
I’m coming for ya
So come on baby press play
I know you want it
I could do this all day
I’m coming for ya
So come on baby press play
I know you want it

Bridge

I can give you everything you need
I’ll be with you until the sun burns out
I can give you everything you need
So come on baby just press play

Chorus

We could do this all day
I’m coming for ya
So come on baby press play
I know you want it
I could do this all day
I’m coming for ya
So come on baby press play
I know you want it
