I would run all the way to you
Across the land that no man’s crossed to
Take it back to 1950
Just to say we’re smoking healthy

I’m taking your photograph and the memory of this place
If you can’t feel my love then I’ll try another day
Singing oh oh oh oh oh, Singing oh oh oh
I will go
Let me go
I swear I’ll go
All the way for you

I’d buy a car that we can ride in
And fly away like oh grease lightning
Take a train to your favourite diner
And you can hold my hand, If you wanna

I’m taking your photograph and the memory of this place
If you can’t feel my love then I’ll try another day
Singing oh oh oh oh oh, Singing oh oh oh
I will go
Let me go, I swear I’ll go
All the way for you
I will go
Let me go, I swear I’ll go
All the way for you

All the way for you
(Mmm Yeah)

La la la la, La la la la, La la la la

I’m taking your photograph and the memory of this place
If you can’t feel my love then I’ll try another day
Singing oh oh oh oh oh, Singing oh oh oh
I will go
Let me go, I swear I’ll go
All the way for you
I will go
Let me go, I swear I’ll go
All the way for you
