Some days a simple song
Is nothing but a song
A melody with words that entertain

But a song can be much more
When it makes you whole
And it feels like it's a little piece of soul  

Chorus:
Baby when you're down
I'll give you the words
And a melody to cry on
Can't do no harm to hear my harmonies
Let me write you a song

I know that you are tired
Of the same old tunes
It seems that only minor scales can come along

Impossible to dance
To the soundtrack of your life
No lullabies on earth can help you get to sleep at night 

Chorus:

Lay your worries down
On the strings of my guitar
Let the keys of my piano 
Play what's on your mind 

Chorus:
