I FELT THAT I KNEW YOU
THE MINUTE I SET MY EYES ON YOU
I SAW THAT YOU KNEW ME
THE MOMENT YOU LOOKED ACROSS THE ROOM

IT WAS THE DAY THAT I MET YOU
I CAN RECALL THE SKY WAS BLUE
IT WAS THE DAY THAT I FOUND YOU
HOW DID YOU KNOW MY HEART WAS TRUE

HEAVEN'S ABOVE
AND HERE IN MY HEART
THEN THIS IS LOVE
YOU'RE DEEP IN MY HEART

WALK UP AND DOWN ALL OVER THIS TOWN
FIGURING OUT WHAT'S BRINGING ME DOWN
IF YOU WERE HERE I'D PROBABLY SAY
NOTHING TO LOSE LET'S PLAY ALL THE WAY

HEAVEN'S ABOVE
AND HERE IN MY HEART
THEN THIS IS LOVE
YOU'RE DEEP IN MY HEART
DEEP IN MY HEART

IT WAS THE DAY THAT I MET YOU
I CAN RECALL THE SKY WAS BLUE
IT WAS THE DAY THAT I FOUND YOU
HOW DID YOU KNOW MY HEART WAS TRUE

HEAVEN'S ABOVE
AND HERE IN MY HEART
THEN THIS IS LOVE
YOU'RE DEEP IN MY HEART
DEEP IN MY HEART
YOU'RE DEEP IN MY HEART
