It never worked out fine
I watched it fall away
It slipped right through my fingers
As I heard you say

We're still the same
You know I feel the stillness
Feel the stillness now
With all the days we learn
We're always one
We're always one somehow

You said "never let me go"
You said "never let me go"
You said "never let me go"
You said "never let me go"

Just when you think it's done
It comes right back at you
And you can't find the light
They said will guide you through

We're still the same
You say that i can hear your voice
I hear your voice
It's no good answer
If this is not your choice
It's not your choice

You said "never let me go"
You said "never let me go"
You said "never let me go"
You said "never let me go"

Remember then
In the lines on my face
Would you know me now?
Not here in my place?

You said "never let me go"
You said "never let me go"
You said "never let me go"
You said "never let me go"
