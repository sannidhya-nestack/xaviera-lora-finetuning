Sunny Day

Take the back road through the valley to your sunny day
She will be with you tonight under clearer skies

Does she thrill you, honey fill you 'till you're feeling fine
While you try her on for size, I'll be standing by

Take the back road through the valley where you'll find your sunny day
She will be with you tonight under clearer skies
I can outrun the rain, til I see you again
I can outrun the rain

She can touch you but it's only temporary high
Her emotions paper-thin will only tear in time

Take the back road through the valley where you'll find your sunny day
She will be with you tonight under clearer skies
I can outrun the rain, til I see you again
I can outrun the rain

Take the back road through the valley where you'll find your sunny day
She will be with you tonight under clearer skies

I can outrun the rain
I can outrun the rain
