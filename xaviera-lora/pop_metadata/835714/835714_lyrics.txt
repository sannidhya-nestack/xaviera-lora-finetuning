Friday Morning Sunrise                             

It’s a bold new day
It all snaps in place
And I’ll pop this world wide open for me
It’s crazy
No matter what they say
I’m gonna make my way
Gonna bend my fate up, carrying me
They’ll see
I’ve logged some miles and covered ground
Paid my dues and now I... feel like a

(Chorus)
Friday morning sunrise
The good days just ahead
I feel this warm light shining from me 
And I’ll make everything brightest yet

(Verse 2)
Got some rough plans made
But it’s come what may
Gonna jump on board to whatever hits me
We’ll see 
Gonna hold my light
Through any haters’ spite
And I’ll stack this deck up purposefully 
To a tee
I’ve got some skills and know-how down
And I’m wide open now and I..  feel like a     
               
(Repeat chorus)

(Bridge)
Nothing’s stopping me from rising
Higher, higher, higher
Come with me
Be free, completely
