Brother 
   
Verse:
Can I, steal a moment of your time
Could I, lend your ears just for a song
I Know, I am just a fool who sings
Songs of little importance to your

Booked up life you live alone
And I can't help you roll this stone
I just sing this song and time rolls by
I dream away and learn from live

Chorus:
Now, brother, brother, brother, brother
Where did you go

Verse:
We are, on this journey you and I
We are, both a little peculiar but who ain't
We gave up much now here we are
So completely lost but oh, so free

Chorus:
Brother, brother, brother, brother
Where are we now

Verse:
Now I keep, a lot of wonderings inside
Cause I've, learned that thoughts like these I have to hide
And now that I sit here alone, on my own
I have patience to wait

Chorus:
Father, father....
Why am I here
Why am I me
