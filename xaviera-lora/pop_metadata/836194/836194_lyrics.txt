OH YOU’RE SUCH A FIND
SO ELECTRICAL SO IMPECCABLE
YOU’RE ONE OF A KIND
SO COLLECTIBLE SO DELECTABLE
I’M SO GLAD THAT YOU’RE MINE
I’M HAVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE

PLEASE DON’T GO AWAY
YOU’RE SO MISSABLE YOU’RE SO KISSABLE
HEY I’M HERE TO STAY
THIS IS SERIOUS I’M DELIRIOUS
BABY WHAT CAN I SAY
COME OUT AND PLAY…

I DO LOVE YOU I DO
AND I KNOW THIS TIME THIS LOVE OF MINE IS TRUE
OH PLEASE SAY YOU DO TOO
CAUSE I DO LOVE YOU I DO

HEAR THOSE TRUMPETS SOUND
SUCH A MELODY SOMETHING'S TELLING ME
YOU MUST BE AROUND
SUCH INTENSITY EVERY SENSE IN ME
SAYS HEY LOOK WHAT I’VE FOUND
DON’T LET ME DOWN…
