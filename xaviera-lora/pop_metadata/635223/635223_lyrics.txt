It’s a Breeze               

Drop your worries, pick up on this fine
Stream of love we’re riding on
Don’t believe those silly rumors life is a chore
I’m tellin’ ya, just
5, 4, 3, 2  count it down with me
We’ll blast off and next you’ll see
What’s behind us shrink and disappear out of view

(CHORUS)
Come on, let’s
Breeze, breeze down this highway
Speed up this ride now
No trial’s too strong
To drag us down we’ll
Breeze, breeze down this highway
We’ve got more inside us
This life isn’t done
We got it, it’s a breeze

(verse 2)
Windows down, we’re flying by
And this fresh air smells like paradise
And we’ve got our destination right, we’re all clear
So now just
Sing with me, now don’t be shy
We got great tunes on, and turned up high
 and our hearts stocked full with all supplies we could need
come on, let’s…
(Repeat chorus)

(bridge)
Right now, in this moment
I feel something growing
Strong good vibes are flowing out all around
This, here, now and after
Let’s keep up the laughter
Let’s relive this chapter time and again..

 (repeat chorus)
