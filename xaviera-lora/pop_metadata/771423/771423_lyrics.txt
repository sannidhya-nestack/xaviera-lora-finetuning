It hit me like a hurricane
And now you're in the fast lane
You know it's never been the same
Since the day you were gone

And baby i'll wait for you
I've been there for you so i'll be there for you

Used to love it when we danced like that
The way that you move you got me feelin' like that
Give me a chance and i would take you back
So we could move on, and on, and on

So come on baby here's the plan
You're gonna find another man
When you remember my name, We'll go back to the days
L-O-V-E doesn't mean a thing without you

And baby i'll wait for you
I've been there for you so i'll be there for you

Used to love it when we danced like that
The way that you move you got me feelin' like that
Give me a chance and i would take you back
So we could move on, and on, and on

Used to love it when we danced like that
The way that you move you got me feelin' like that
Give me a chance and i would take you back
So we could move on, and on, and on

Maybe we can run away
Maybe in another life
Maybe we can fly away
But only if you hold me tight

Used to love it when we danced like that
The way that you move you got me feelin' like that
Give me a chance and i would take you back
So we could move on, and on, and on

Used to love it when we danced like that
The way that you move you got me feelin' like that
Give me a chance and i would take you back
So we could move on, and on, and on
(and on, and on, and on, and on, and on...)
