Heya Heya Heya Heya Hey

Crow Maiden Day

Stone by stone this wall must build,
Step by step we walk up hill,

Heya heya heya hey yeah
Crow maiden day
Heya heya heya hey yeah

Sticks and bones my hands are worn and old,
Hearing whispers of their fortunes told,
With the will of flame we drag the men,
Up the cliffs and down again,
Their crow inside starts to grow.

Heya heya heya hey yeah
Crow maiden day
Heya heya heya hey yeah
Heya heya heya hey yeah
Crow maiden day
Heya heya heya hey yeah

Stone by stone this world must build,
Step by step we walk up hills,

Heya heya heya hey yeah
Heya heya heya hey yeah
Heya heya heya hey yeah
Crow maiden day
Heya heya heya hey yeah

On crow maiden day.
