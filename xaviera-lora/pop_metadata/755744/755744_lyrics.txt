LOVE TAKES HOSTAGES

Don’t be cruel, don’t be mean
But don’t be sweet and wonderful
Be alright, be OK so it’s 
Easy to leave when youTake it away.
I am only protecting
Cause I am sick of investing 

I’m scared, that road’s paved in fear
I’m not going that way, maybe next year (never)
You might be perfect for me
But hold it back baby,  
I’m not ready

When you smile, I start to feel
Cover up and  don’t be so real
Tone it down, make mistakes
Tie your to love an anchor then swim  far away
I am drowning in pity
You are not gonna save me

I’m scared, that road’s paved in fear
I’m not going that way, maybe next year (never)
You might be perfect for me
But hold it back baby, I’m not ready 
Cause I won’t be let down again
I’m ready to let go, just tell me when
And you might be perfect for me
That’s why you should let goI’m not ready
I’m not ready
