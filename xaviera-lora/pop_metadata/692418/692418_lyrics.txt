Pushing sand through our toes
Let’s watch the sun dip low
Tidewaters wash real slow

Taking my hand down the street
Toasting beer cans in the heat
Moon shines so bright; we can turn off the lights

Let this night last forever
Let the world stand still
Don’t let me wake up cause it’s morning
I’m not ready for forever to end

Sails glide through the grass 
Nothin’ like down home country class
Where blue-eyed winks and keylime drinks
Cover history, in sweet low country

Let this night last forever
Let the world stand still
Don’t let me wake up cause it’s morning
I’m not ready for forever to end

Right Here, tonight, is like the 4th of July
Especially when we’re making love in the moonlight 

Let this night last forever
Let the world stand still
Don’t let me wake up cause it’s morning
I’m not ready for forever to end
