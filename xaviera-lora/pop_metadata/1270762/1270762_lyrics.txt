[Verse]
If only I could fly
Touch the sky so high
Break the chains tonight
Feel the world so bright

[Verse 2]
If only dreams came true
Every wish so new
I'd dance the whole night through
Chasing stars with you

[Chorus]
If only if only
You were right her today
I'd hold you I'd hold you
Together mostly

[Verse 3]
If only time would stop
Up to the mountain top
With you I'd run non-stop
No need for a clock

[Verse 4]
If only we were free
Like waves in the sea
Together you and me
Forever we would be

[Chorus]
If only if only
You were here today
I'd hold you I'd hold you
Together mostly
