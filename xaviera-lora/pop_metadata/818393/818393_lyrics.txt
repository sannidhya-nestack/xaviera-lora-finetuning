Why do you tell me to fly?
When wings where never what you gave me!
And why, when i open up my eyes,
Do I see that you can never safe me?

I tried to change the way i feel
and everything that’s real ….. about me.
But you lied to   including yourself
made me believe i’m just another weed under the trees

Let me grow till i can reach the sunlight!
Let me go so i can find my way
Let me out of this place so that i can retrace the old lines
that i drew in my cover up days 

Take the blame
take the lid from the box that contains you old ways
Take my hand
let me show you
How you feel isn’t really the same.
When you’re stuck in a freeze frame. 

Every time you tell me who i am
You’re messing with my head
You build me and you break me down
pick me up from the bottom to the top
make me ready for the drop
But i’m not gonna fall this time around

Let me climb and stumble in my own way
let me feel what it’s like to be ok
on my own even if the road is dark and alone
I will be free from my cover up days

Take the blame
take the lid from the box that contains you old ways
Take my hand
let me show you
How you feel isn’t really the same.
When you’re stuck in a freeze frame. 

Take a picture for me baby.
Take a picture and lean back.
Do you think that i’m content now?
Always waving the white flag.
Take a picture for me maybe
I will guess what’s on you’re mind.
The dimension all invades
I can’t seem to get it right!
