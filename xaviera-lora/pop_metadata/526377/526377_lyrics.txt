Into the Night

You're so sultry, so enticing, won't you take a look at me
Mercury's rising, that's not surpising, you're not like any man I've seen
I feel the heartbeat within my soul,
Call out to you so you know you're not alone, 
If your desire for love should grow
I can take you where you want to go

Into the Night, Into the Night love, love
Into the Night, Into the Night love, love
Into the Night, Into the Night love, love
Into the Night, Tnto the Night love, love

Let's get closer, want you near me, say you'll come away with me
I never get enough of the sweetness in you touch, so take my hand we'll slip in to the night
Don't tell me if I'm dreamin, this love that I believe in, is heaven every minute I'm with you
I can feel the love in your kiss, hey baby listen to this. I wanna hold you all through the night

Into the Night, Into the Night love, love
Into the Night, Into the Night love, love
Into the Night, Into the Night love, love
Into the Night, Tnto the Night love, love


I want to hold you, I want to please you, I want to touch you, I want to heal you
I'm gonna take you, into the night
I want to touch you, I want to please you, I'm gonna take you, I want to tease you
I'm want to hold you all through the night, love
