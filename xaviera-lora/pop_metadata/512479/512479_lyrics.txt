You know you can’t have me
But I see your gaze
You touch me with your eyes
In so many ways
 I try to approach you, but you vanish yet again
Don’t keep doing this to me

 
You’re the shadow on the wall
You keep haunting my dreams
I can’t take much more
Everything is not what it seems
Will you just disappear
Or just walk through the door
Goodbye phantom
	 
 
You go places
Where you know I will be
Tormenting just to see
That you’re looking at me	
I try to approach you, but you vanish yet again
Don’t keep doing this to me


You’re the shadow on the wall
You keep haunting my dreams
I can’t take much more
Everything is not what it seems
Will you just disappear
Or just walk through the door

Your presence is all around your all I can see oh I can't sleep
Its tearing me up inside but i won't burn down no I won't be drowned
i won't fall no i won't fall 

You’re the shadow on the wall
You keep haunting my dreams
I can’t take much more
Everything is not what it seems
Will you just disappear
Or just walk through the door
Goodbye phantom
