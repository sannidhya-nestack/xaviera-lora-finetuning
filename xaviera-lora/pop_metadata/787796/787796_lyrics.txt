The world is bigger than me bigger than I'll ever be,
I don't think I'll ever see what's right in front of me.

I hate how much we have changed, everything has rearrange,
I want exactly the same, can we go back again?

Will Everything Work Out?
I Guess I'll Never Know.

YOU'RE TURNING ME INSIDE OUT,
UPSIDE DOWN, ROUND AND ROUND,
CAN ANYONE HEAR ME NOW,
I'M INSIDE OUT,
SHOUT IT ALOUD, FEET OFF THE GROUND,
I'M NEVER COMING DOWN.

I don't know what I will do, my world is broken in two,
I feel like I never knew, It's all because of you.

This is the way it will be, this is how life is for me,
I hope that one day I'll see what's right in front of me.

I Know That It Will Work Out,
I've Never Been So Sure.

WHEN MY EMOTIONS ARE TALKING TO ME THIS IS WHAT THEY SAY,
KEEP YOUR HEAD UP STAY STRONG AND YOU'LL BE ALL THAT YOU CAN BE.
