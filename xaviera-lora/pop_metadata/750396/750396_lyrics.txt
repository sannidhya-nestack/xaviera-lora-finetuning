For A Lifetime  

I thought I could breathe underwater with you 
Now our love is drowning I'm broken in two 

I don't want to wait another life 
Baby this is fate you and I 
I just want to take another dive 
One last time 

Take me back to where it started 
And lay me down, be my harness 
The night will last for a lifetime 
And our stars will guide us back home 

Guide us back home 
Guide us back home 

I thought I could walk through the fire for you 
Now my heart is burning I can't see this through 

I don't want to wait another life 
Baby this is fate you and I 
I just want to take another dive 
One last time 

Take me back to where it started 
And lay me down, be my harness 
The night will last for a lifetime 
And our stars will guide us back home 
 
Guide us back home
Guide us back home 

Take my hand and don't let go 
Guide us, guide us, guide us home (x2)

Take me back to where it started 
And lay me down, be my harness 
The night will last for a lifetime 
And our stars will guide us back home 

Guide us back home 
Guide us back home
