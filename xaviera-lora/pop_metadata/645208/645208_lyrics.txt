Biding time in a hurricane’s eye
In a hurricane’s eye I’m hiding out
From a whimsical dream 
and a picture unreal in its scenery
probing blindly for sturdy firm grounds
a succorable sound to lean upon
while a constant alarm makes my senses disarm
into shield mode
Make me fly
sky out to everywhere
let me scrutinize the wonders of the well
make me fly
sky out to everyone
and to everywhere
talking loud in a gutsy tone is how
I’d be making my proudness suffocate
when you’re never uptight and got everything right
it is easy
spinning around in oblivious times
every warning sign drows in irony
in a quest for relief 
by the eminent deed of a lifetime
