Don’t you ever

Don’t you ever dare to come around
Don’t you ever dare to make a sound
Cause I’ve been watching and look what I have found
You and your ladies sleeping around!


I’m sleeping next to you
Every single night
But boy there’s no way
It don’t feel right

You’re avoiding me,
and run away,
well you keep running
but your lies will stay!


Don’t you ever dare to come around
Don’t you ever dare to make a sound
Cause I’ve been watching and look what I have found
You and your ladies sleeping around!


You didn’t even have
the guts to tell,
Me the truth,
does that word ring a bell?

Spare me your lies,
keep your defence, I’m out!
Your ruthless lies,
They scream too loud!


Don’t you ever dare to come around
Don’t you ever dare to make a sound
Cause I’ve been watching and look what I have found
You and your ladies sleeping around!

Oh boy,
You must have lost your mind!
Why else
Would you be so blind?
You gave everything away?
And lost a woman like me?!


Don’t you ever dare to come around
Don’t you ever dare to make a sound
Cause I’ve been watching and look what I have found
You and your ladies sleeping around!!!
