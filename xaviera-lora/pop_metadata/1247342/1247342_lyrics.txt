[Verse 1:]
Every time we fight the tears start to fall
You say you're alright but I see it all
In your eyes a river of unshed pain
Your waterworks start in the pouring rain

[Chorus:]
Your waterworks falling down
Tears and heartaches all around
In the storm where we both drown
Your waterworks without a sound

[Verse 2:]
Late at night in silence the emotions flow
Words left unspoken but I always know
Underneath the surface where the hurt resides
Your waterworks reveal the pain you hide

[Chorus:]
Your waterworks falling down
Tears and heartaches all around
In the storm where we both drown
Your waterworks without a sound

[Verse 3:]
Trying to hold you close but the distance grows
Every tear that falls in the river flows
Wishing I could take all your pain away
Your waterworks keep pouring night and day

[Chorus:]
Your waterworks falling down
Tears and heartaches all around
In the storm where we both drown
Your waterworks without a sound

[Verse 4:]
As the dawn approaches drying all the tears
Hope begins to rise chasing all the fears
In the light of morning love will find its way
Your waterworks will end and we’ll be okay

[Chorus:]
Your waterworks falling down
Tears and heartaches all around
In the storm where we both drown
Your waterworks without a sound

[Outro:]
In the quiet of your eyes
Where the storm of sorrow lies
Finding peace in love profound
Your waterworks no longer found
