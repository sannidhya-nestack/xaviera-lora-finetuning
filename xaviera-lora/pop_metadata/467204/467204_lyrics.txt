Set my beauty free


Verse 1:
Need no sanctity, don’t put me down,
Need none to protect me, I’ve been around
My destiny-- is up to me, so just...

Chorus:
Let me be
Let me be me
Just let me be 
Let me be free

Verse 2:
I don’t think like you, you say I’m proud
I’m my own person, I scream it aloud            
All that I dream-- is up to me.

CHORUS

Bridge:
Everything has changed, yet it all stays the same
Call it by a different name.  I wanna change the rules of the game, yeah

Verse 3:
My sense of self is strong, don’t patronize
I have honor and courage, I will not be denied 
I’ll do things my way--no matter what you say…

Double Chorus
