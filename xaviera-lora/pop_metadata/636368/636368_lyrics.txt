What's Next

Lyrics by Kristi McKeever


I hide behind
The naked truth
When we are together
I live in fear
But dare to dream
This can last forever

Hold me above
The shaky ground
When the storm attacks
Then bury your heart
In my open arms
If we fall thru the cracks

What's next
My lost and lonely lover
What's next
Will there be another
Day or night of discovery
As the sun shines and settles down
Can we
Can we
What's next

We catch our breath
And whisper secrets
Already spoken
We hold on for love
In a ring of fire
Echoes can’t be broken

What's next
My lost and lonely lover
What's next
Will there be another
Day or night of discovery
As the sun shines and settles down
Can we
Can we
What's next

If we follow the trail of our fleeting light
We can catch it before it disappears in the night
