MAGIC WORDS

The moon  
Lights up your face 
I hold my breath 
Feel an urgency inside
To wake you up 
And tell you  
All the things, left unsaid, for too long

The words hang heavy in my mouth 
Like rain can't fall without a cloud 
I don’t have the strength to pour them out

I wana tell you 
Your the one I talk to in my dreams
I wana tell you
These magic words 
I’m wanting you to hear


Then I hear you 
Talking in your sleep  
And I wonder 
Is it me 
You are talking to
So I turn 
A round to take a look 
But your eye s are closed 
While your lips were moving


You say the words left in my mouth 
Like rain they fall n break the drought
Some how you have the strength to pour them out

Tumbling round my barricade
Breaking through the walls Id made
Washing all my silly fears away


You double my pleasure 
And you halve my troubles
I can't wait for everyday
That we start with cuddles
