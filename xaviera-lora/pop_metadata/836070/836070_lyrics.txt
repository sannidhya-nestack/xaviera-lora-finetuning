(Chorus)
Baby your're lyin' to me again, baby you're lyin' about everything
Don't you know I can't trust a word you say, yeah baby you're throwin' it all away
Baby your're lyin' to me again, baby you're lyin' about where you've been, Don't you know I can't trust a word you say, yeah baby you're throwin' our love away, throwin' our love away

You're goin' out on me, breakin' all of the promises you didn't mean, Then you come crawlin' back to see if I didn't notice you were gone
You're goin' out on me, and I've tried to forgive and pretend I didn't see, but there no goin' back when you won't even own what you've done

(Chorus)

I gave you everything I got, I was hot, loved you a lot, was patient, thoughtful and kind like I was taught, never fought, 'till you got caught!
But you got some endless need inside you keep tryin' to hide, it's takin' you for a ride, takin' over your life, I'll never be your wife!
It's like you got a big hole in your soul you can't fill, a need you keep tryin' to feed, but you don't need me, get some therapy!

You'll have to find somebody else, who doesn't care about herself, but I got too much goin' on so it's time that you were gone
Yeah you'll have to find somebody new who's even more messed up than you, I've got a lot more self respect than back when we first met

(Chorus)
