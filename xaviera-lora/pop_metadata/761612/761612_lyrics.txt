I want to feel that bass drop 
i'm going in i'm about that life
when the clock hits 2 i'm ready to move and your just my type
give me the night and i make take two
under the lights i want to see you move
after bar going down around 2 and I got something to prove
better hold you girl tight
when i'm on the scene and i'm lifted up
started with a bottle and we mixed it up
baby this your jam and we turned it up
them 808's bumping and we are cutting it loose
cracking them cans we are breaking those rules
hell of a night that's a thing that we do
living for one but i'm drinking for two

Girl you crazy
and when i say crazy I think you are amazing
all your girlfriends are bar hoping and shopping at forever 21 but you were born in the 80's
want to come back to my place its a castle actually that's just a lie see i do what I can to get by
so how do I spend my condos kind of small but there is room for princess
And I got friends girl you can bring like 3 friends make this after party last all weekend
cameras cheesing sleeping eating take a little nap after that repeating 
Oh so fly (so fly) and if we fall in love oh me oh my 
together we can live long and love life
I don't love you yet but I love you tonight Mike Less

You know we go hard right in the scene
falling in love then I'm breaking it clean
breaking it clean you know what I mean
I'm making it fun I'm making a scene
shorty look good you know I might hit
give her the night and take her off my list
talk about a list the kid makes hits
man I'm trying to keep ladies of both my wrists like this
Get up Get up
this for the girls in the line to get lit up
this for the guys who are buying that liquor
act like tonight you aren't throwing that up
me and Chris we don't make songs
we make hits so this is a hit list 
for all the ladies
playing our stuff when they are running their business
can I get a witness
