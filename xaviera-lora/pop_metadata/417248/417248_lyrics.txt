Vs   Well you think I can’t get by – well I do, I do
     We both stood face to face and said – I do, and I did
     It’s a long dark road we’ve traveled down – to where we used to be  
     I found that’s not the way that love was meant to be
       Well I thought that I could trust you - and I did, yes I did
       Guess you played me for the fool – you did, yes you did
       All that I once gave to you – Is killing me inside                                       
       That’s not the kind of love to last through all of time 

Ch  I will try every road that one day may take me to wherever he may be
    ‘Till I feel in my heart it’s true, I’ll keep asking if this is you
     If it’s you, It will be how love was meant to be

Vs   Well I dreamt of love forever – and I did, and I do
     For the worse and for the better – I did, and I do
   There’s one dream in life I’ve waited for – that’s what you were to me
   I’ve learned that’s not the way that love was meant to be

Ch   I will try every road that one day may take me to wherever he may be
    ‘Till I feel in my heart it’s true, I’ll keep asking if this is you
     If it’s you, It will be how love was meant to be

Instrumental

Prechorus   The  strength that I have counted on has never come from you
            You don’t think I have the faith inside, I do

Bridge  I must go on now, knowing somewhere, somehow……ohhhh

Chorus out
     I will try every road that one day may take me to wherever he may be
    ‘Till I feel in my heart it’s true, I’ll keep asking if this is you
     If it’s you, It will be how love was meant to be
                  It will be how love was meant to be
