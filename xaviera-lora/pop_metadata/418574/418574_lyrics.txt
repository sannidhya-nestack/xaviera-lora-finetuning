NO MORE

I know you wish me well
You took all my remembrance 
Remainder of nonsensical relation
I know, your promises were copied
From best seller romance 
And it’s poor consolation
And I, everyday I buy all your favourite food 
See, I’m still waiting

Over the moon you’ll wait for me
Over the sea you’ll need me no more
Lying in my arms I’ll see you
Holding my breath I’ll see you no more
You’ll never be with me again

I know what all they say
I know that I’ll be better 
But however hard I try to understand
Why did you have to leave me? 
I don’t see why you can’t remain with me
And I, everyday I ask – is she good-looking?
Are they having fun?
