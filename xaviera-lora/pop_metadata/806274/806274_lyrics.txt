In the morning 
Boy it feels so right. 
Thinking 'bout you, 
cuz I've stayed up all night. 
Wondering if you
feel the way I do
It's so brand new. 

But Oh, 
Something don't feel right. 
Don't say so, 
Rather be the last to know, 
Don't be the last to know. 

Feels like I'm 
Caught in the crowd 
And my guards coming down 
Along with my hair 
Oh baby it's not fair
I try to say no 
But it just comes out as 
Oh Baby you're driving me crazy. 
I'm caught in a scene 
from a Lady Gaga song
I want your bad romance 
Baby just dance. 
Lets play a game 
a foolish love game
And I'll put on my Poker Face tonight. 
Tonight feels right 
Not tonight. 

When you kiss me
Boy it feels so right 
But your intentions 
will keep me up all night. 
Wondering if you 
feel the way I do. 
I'm so confused 

But Oh, 
Something don't feel right. 
Don't say so, 
Don't wanna hear I told you so, 
Yeah I told you so. 

Feels like I'm 
Caught in the crowd 
And my guards coming down 
Along with my hair 
Oh baby it's not fair
I try to say no 
But it just comes out as 
Oh Baby you're driving me crazy. 
I'm caught in a scene 
from a Lady Gaga song
I want your bad romance 
Baby just dance. 
Lets play a game 
a foolish love game
And I'll put on my Poker Face tonight. 
Tonight feels right 
Not tonight. 

Attraction is there 
But emotions aren't clear. 
I'm all over you
You're all over me
I try to pretend 
put up my best defense 
I'm all over you
You're all over me
How can I resist you now…

Feels like I'm 
Caught in the crowd 
And my guards coming down 
Along with my hair 
Oh baby it's not fair
I try to say no 
But it just comes out as 
Oh Baby you're driving me crazy. 
I'm caught in a scene 
from a Lady Gaga song
I want your bad romance 
Baby just dance. 
Lets play a game 
a foolish love game
And I'll put on my Poker Face tonight. 
Tonight feels right 
Not tonight.
