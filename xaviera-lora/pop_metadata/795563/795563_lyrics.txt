i'm overpowered
cuz you're under my skin
like runnin'naked 
while being dressed in bliss

overpowered 
gonna let you win
underneath these thick walls
resistance is thin

i'm overacting
my heart is thrilled
while i'm under fire
you might just shoot to kill

In a paradise lost
winner takes all
don't run 
we struck gold

the deeper we might fall
in a higher love 
we won't run
we struck gold

kissed by the sun
we'll unfold
won't run
we struck gold
we'll come undone
cuz we found love

these undercurrents
of being overjoyed
had me shocked and stunned
but turned me on

it's not overrated
to have a heart that sings
it'll dance on a wire
for a love that kills

In a paradise lost
winner takes all
don't run 
we struck gold

the deeper we might fall
on a higher love 
don't run
we struck gold

kissed by the sun
we'll unfold
won't run
we struck gold
we'll come undone
cuz we found love

overdoing
the things we've done
makes us understand
we struck gold

with finding love
we're stayin' high
with finding love
we saved our lives

In a paradise lost
winner takes all
don't run 
we struck gold

the deeper we might fall
on a higher love 
don't run
we struck gold

kissed by the sun
we'll unfold
won't run
we struck gold
we'll come undone
cuz we found love
