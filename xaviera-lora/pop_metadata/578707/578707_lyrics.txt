I'm under attack,
dazed and all consumed

'bout to crack
cuz i think you're filthy cute

diving into deep
diving into deep 
feels like i'm diving into deep,
disarmed and drunk on you

'guess all my flaws
laying bare like an open book

they make you smile
like a kid with a rubics cube

flying without wings
flying without wings
feels i am flying without wings
and free fallin’ for you

Lost my breath
from how you turn me on
found a damn fine mess
i ain't running from

fire as you will
fire as you will
come on fire as you will
and please shoot to kill
 
if i would die in your arms 
paradise were bittersweet

if i would die in your arms 
paradise were bittersweet

i'd be damned if it's for real
cuz Heaven would be Hell to me

you could be my iron lung
my life support
i’d stay forever young
with no beating heart

if i would die in your arms 
i’ll have the time of my life cuz it’s sealed
by you

you’re a wildfire 
a burning love in jeans

i’m being burned alive
should be soaked in sunscreen

gonna let it go
gonna let it go
i'm gonna let it go 
till you'll make me scream

Lost my breath
from how you turn me on
found a damn fine mess
i ain't running from

you may fire as you will
fire as you will
come on fire as you will
and just shoot to kill

if i would die in your arms 
paradise were bittersweet

i'd be damned if it's for real
cuz Heaven would be Hell to me

you could be my iron lung
my life support
i’d stay forever young
with no beating heart

if i would die in your arms 
i’ll have the time of my life cuz it’s sealed
by you
by you
 
if i would die in your arms 
thank God for irony

if i would die in your arms 
paradise were bittersweet

i'd be damned if it's for real
cuz Heaven would be Hell to me

you could be my iron lung
my life support
i’d stay forever young
with no beating heart

if i would die in your arms 
i’ll have the time of my life cuz it’s sealed
by you
