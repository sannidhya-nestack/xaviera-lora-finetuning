Trumpet Playin’ Man

Last night down on Becker Street
Where all those hungry wolves and evening ladies meet
I saw you slip out of your car 
And make your way to our favorite bar

I heard the cats that play on Wednesday night
And I began to see the light

As we danced to the music
Caught your glances oh so sly
Saw you peek into the corner
From the corner of my eye
Now I know it was all part of the plan
You had a thing for that Trumpet Playin' Man

Remember how it used to be?
I played that sweet guitar
And your eyes shone for me
Now you trade those steely things
The wind has changed
To brass and horny things

I'll drink scotch whiskey to the Deacon Blues
And you can live the life you choose

But don't you lose my number
Keep it tucked inside your coat
Never know just when that trumpet
Might produce a sour note
His whole routine may be a Royal Scam
Babe, beware now of that Trumpet Playin' Man

He's the king of scammy scoundrels
A dishonest Dr. Wu
We both know that Katy Lies
But he does too

So don't you lose my number
Keep it tucked inside your coat
Never know just when that trumpet
Might produce a sour note
His whole routine may be a Royal Scam
Babe, beware now of that Trumpet Playin' Man
