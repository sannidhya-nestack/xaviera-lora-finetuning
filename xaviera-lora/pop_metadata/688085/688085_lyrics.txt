I saw his face on a billboard
I took his place for a little while
But you said I don't have the drive

I can't replace a better man
I cannot give you all he can
And you said I don't have the life

Cos I live on a tightrope
In a house made out of string
I can't give you anything

I sleep in between the lines
Trying to keep up the lie
That I'm anything more than 
A fool for you

I'm a fool for you
Tangled in dizzy streets
I'm a fool for you
And I don't care if it matter
I'm a fool for you
Lost in between the sheets
I'm a fool for you
Now nothing really matters

I saw his face on a billboard
And for a while I saw my own
Made it look so very easy

I'm too tired
Too cold
Look too young
Feel too old
Feel too small
To ever be more

Cos I live on a tightrope
In a house made out of string
I can't give you anything

I sleep in between the lines
Trying to keep up the lie
That I'm anything more than 
A fool for you

I'm a fool for you
Tangled in dizzy streets
I'm a fool for you
And I don't care if it matter
I'm a fool for you
Lost in between the sheets
I'm a fool for you
Now nothing really matters

anymore, anymore, anymore
