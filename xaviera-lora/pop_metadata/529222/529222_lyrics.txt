The Play Button- Suchitra Lata

Verse1
Why does it feel like deja vu
Yet why does it hurt like never before
You seem to be a stranger now
Yet I've known you so many lives before
Why does it seem so old and timeless
but I met you only yesterday
Why does the move look so new
When I've danced a 100 times before

Chorus
The play button's on but the images  rewind
The play button's on  but  the pictures unwind
A still life study

Verse2
Why does it feel like the same rain
yet it smells so fresh today
A new sun sets every evening
Yet the horizon has not changed
When I look in the mirror I see
not just my face but so many ghosts
Behind my shoulder stands a line
smeared with reality and my mind

Chorus
The play button's on but the images  rewind
The play button's on  but  the pictures unwind
A still life study

Bridge
There might be pauses but I shall be
forever holding  your hand, my love
