[Verse]
Throw a coin in the wishing well
Close my eyes and make a spell
Hope that dreams come true tonight
Under stars so clear so bright

[Verse 2]
Echoes whisper dreams will tell
Shining through this magic shell
Heartbeats racing in the dark
Chasing dreams a tiny spark

[Chorus]
Wishing well oh can you hear
All my hopes and all my fears
Grant my wish oh hold me tight
In the silence of the night

[Verse 3]
Moonlight dances on the stream
In this moment life’s a dream
Wishing in this quiet place
Hope is written on my face

[Chorus]
Wishing well oh can you hear
All my hopes and all my fears
Grant my wish oh hold me tight
In the silence of the night

[Verse 4]
Hear the whispers soft and low
Feel the magic start to grow
Wishing well oh guide the way
Bring me to a brand new day
