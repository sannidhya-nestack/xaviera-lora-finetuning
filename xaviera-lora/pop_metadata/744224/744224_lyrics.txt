How did you end up here?
Your looking so confused
Whoever told you this was something you might lose

I see you sitting there
You've simply lost your way
You know the sun is going to shine again on you someday

Cause it's a long way back 
to where you come from
Gonna see yourself shinin in the sun and
it's time to look ahead 
to where your going everything will be just fine

You know I love you
You know you love you to
Let's change this color scheme from screaming red to bright blue

Cause ti's a long way back
to where you come from
gonna see yourself shining in the sun and
it's time to look ahead to where your going
everything will be just fine

Feeling jaded
Complicated
Trying so hard
To rise above

And it's a long way back
to where you come from 
gonna see yourself shining in the sun and
it's time to look ahead to where 
your going everything will be just fine

And it's a long way back
to where you come from 
Going to see yourself
shining in the sun and
it's time to look ahead 
to where your going everything will be just fine
You gotta free your heart and shine
