I've been home all alone, just waiting for you
See you found new love, so lonely without you
Girl you know the night is cold, I stay long nights in
Now I'm on my own, I can't make it alone
Oh girl, come and stay
Put your arms around me hey like you used to do
Let's start a new love now
Come on home girl if you still can come
As soon as you can cause someone's still waiting for you
As soon as you can cause someone's still waiting for you
As soon as you can cause someone's still waiting for you
As soon as you can cause someone's still waiting for you
