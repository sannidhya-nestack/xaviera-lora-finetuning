Полный билетик играю с тобой
Затем взлетая, светятся в невиненье
Не тронутся рукой, свободы большой
Светится она не зная, сожалению
Live me to see
On itra krasad zhivitsy
I zeleni, yarki, alkanoy
Anani adenoka
Voskud ye bryzye
Dikiye takana
Tepniye frity
It's been years since I've seen someone so sick and dead
I've been trying to hide from this instinct of human behavior
But now I realize I'm sick because I'm bored of
What is good and what is not, what's the facts?
I'm sick because I can't get enough, get up and sing along
Sick because I can't get enough, get up and sing along
So here I am again, if it's a thousand years, I'll be here to face the world tonight
