See how the fruit fly flies, the fruit fly flies, the fruit fly flies
See how she'll touch the sky, she'll touch the sky, she'll touch the sky
See how all living beings are one
Just like a choir, we all sing the same song
The same song, oh
See how the fruit fly flies
The fruit fly flies
The fruit fly flies
See how she makes me smile
She makes me smile
She makes me smile
See how nothing will ever fade away
See how there's no reason to be afraid now
See how our living beings are one
Just like her choir
We all sing the same song
The same song, oh
See how the fruit fly flies
The fruit fly flies
The fruit fly flies
See how she'll touch the sky
She'll touch the sky
She'll touch the sky
