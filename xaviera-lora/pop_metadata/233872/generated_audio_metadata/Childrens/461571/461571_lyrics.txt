Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack jump out with a candlestick
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack
Jack's bread could eat no fat
His wife could eat no lean
And so between them both you see
They lick the platter clean
Jack's bread could eat no fat
His wife could eat no lean
And so between them both you see
They lick the platter clean
Come on now
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack jumped over the candlestick
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack jumped over the candlestick
I said Jack Spratt could eat no fat
His wife could eat no lean
And so between them both you see
They licked the bladder clean
Come on now
Ooh, let me see you now
Jack Sprat could eat no fat
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack jump over the candlestick
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack
Jack Sprat could eat no fat
His wife could eat no lean
And so between them both you see
They lick the platter clean
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack jump over the candlestick
Jack Sprat could eat no fat, his wife could eat no lean
And so between them both you see they lick the platter clean
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack jump over the candlestick
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack jump over the candlestick
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack jump over the candlestick
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack jump over the candlestick
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack jump over the candlestick
Jack's bright, could he know?
Fat and his white, could he know?
Lean and soul between them both
You see they lick the platter clean
