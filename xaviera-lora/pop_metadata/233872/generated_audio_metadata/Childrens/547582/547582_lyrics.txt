Little red caboose behind the train, train, train, train, train, train, train
Little red caboose, chug, chug, chug
Little red caboose, chug, chug, chug
Little red caboose behind the train, train, train, train
Smokestack on his back, back, back, back
Coming down the track, track, track, track
Little red caboose behind the train
Little red caboose, chug, chug, chug
Little red caboose, chug, chug chug
Little red caboose behind the train, train, train, train
Coming round the bend, bend, bend, bend
Hanging round the end, end, end, end
Little red caboose behind the train
And when you hear that whistle, you feel just like a king
And when you hear that bell ring, it makes you wanna sing about them
Little red caboose, chug, chug, chug
Little red caboose, chug, chug chug
Little red caboose behind the train, train, train, train
Smokestack on his back, back, back, back
Coming down the track, track, track, track
Little red caboose behind the train (Turn around, turn around ding dong)
Riding down the track just singing a song
I see a train coming down the track
Little red caboose waiting back
Little red caboose chug chug chug
Little red caboose chug chug chug
Little red caboose behind the train train train train
Smokestack on his back back back back
Coming down the track track track track
Little red caboose behind the train
Little red caboose chug chug chug
Little red caboose chug chug chug
Little red caboose behind the train train train train
Smoke stack on his back back back back
Coming down the track track track track
Little red caboose behind the train
And when I get the notion to ride a train so grand
I never wanna sit down, I always wanna stand aboard
The little red caboose, chug, chug, chug
Little red caboose, chug, chug, chug
Little red caboose behind the train, train, train, train
Smoke stack on his back, back, back, back
Coming down the track, track, track, track
Little red caboose behind the train
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, get it going
Riding down the track, just singing a song
I see a train coming down the track
Little red caboose, waiting back
Little red caboose, chug-chug-chug
Little red caboose, chug-chug chug
Little red caboose behind the train, train, train, train
Smoke stack on his back, back, back, back
Coming down the track, track, track, track
Little red caboose behind the train
Little red caboose, chug, chug, chug
Little red caboose, chug, chug chug
Little red caboose behind the train, train, train, train
Coming round the bend, bend, bend, bend
Hanging round the end, end, end, end
Little red caboose behind the train
The freighters are so handsome they brighten up the track
But nothing is so handsome as the one that's in the back
I love the little red caboose, chug, chug, chug
Little red caboose, chug, chug chug
Little red caboose behind the train, train, train, train
Smoke smack on his back, back, back, back
Coming down the track, track, track, track
Little red caboose behind the train
Little red caboose behind the train
Chugga-chugga ding-dong
Riding on the track just singing a song
I see a train coming down the track
Little red caboose weighing back
Chugga-chugga ding-dong
Riding on the track just singing a song
I see the train coming down the track
Little red caboose behind the train, train, train, train, train, train, little red caboose behind the train, oooh
