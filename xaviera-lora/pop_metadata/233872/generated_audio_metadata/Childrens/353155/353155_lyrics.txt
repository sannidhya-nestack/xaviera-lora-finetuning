When I'm playing in my room
I'm watching Space Ghost cartoons
And I get hungry pretty soon
But please don't bring me yogurt and a spoon
I like chocolate milk
And I like cinnamon toast
But I like chocolate milk
I like french fries the most
And I think ice cream's cool
And you know candy rules, yeah
But I like french fries the most
French fries in the hurt that mine knows
Gimme those french fried potatoes
I like'em
French fried potatoes
When I'm hungry late at night
When I get hungry in the day
If you ask me what I'd like
Well here is what I'd say
I like chocolate milk and I like cinnamon toast
But I like french fries the most
And I think ice cream's cool
And you know candy rules, yeah
But I like French fries the most
French fries bigger than my nose
Give me those French fried potatoes
I like'em
French fried potatoes
