We've got the day to roam and play
No grown up rules along the way
The sun is bright, the sky is new
We feel alive, me and you
Oh, can't you feel the heartbeat race?
We're dancing free in time and space
This melody lifts us so high
We'll never let this moment pass by
Oh, we're painting rainbows on the street
Skipping in trainers feeling the beat
Side by side with every friend
A world of wonder that never ends
Hold tight to every dream
It's brighter than it seems
Together we rise in harmony
Where laughter is the key
Oh can't you feel the heartbeat race
We're dancing free in time and space
This melody lifts us so high
We'll never let this moment pass by
We'll catch the stars in our open hands
Write our stories in shining sands
From silly jokes to fearless tries
We hold the magic in our eyes
Oh, can't you feel the heartbeat race?
We're dancing free in time and space
This melody lifts us so high
We'll never let this moment pass by
We wave goodbye, we're in strife
Embrace the wonder of our young life
Singing loud, hearts all aglow
Those tunes are home wherever we go
