Have you ever thought about being an astronaut?
I think it would be wonderful fun to zoom around in a rocket in outer space.
Then, if you're real lucky, maybe you could find a little alien. Widgeewadgee!
I'm sitting in my rocket
I'm gonna go to Mars
I'm sitting in my rocket
I'm gonna go see stars
So beep beep beep out of my way here I go
Hey hey hey I'm gonna go way up high
In my rocket I will fly
So beep beep beep out of my way here I go
Hey hey hey I'm gonna go way up high
In my rocket I will fly
So mama don't you call me
Daddy don't you fret
Mama don't you worry
My feet they won't get wet
I'll be real careful
Way out there in space
I'll brush my teeth and comb my hair
And I will wash my face
So beep beep beep out of my way here I go
Hey hey hey I'm gonna go way up high in my rocket
I will fly
So beep beep beep out of my way here I go
Hey hey hey I'm gonna go way up high in my rocket
I will fly
