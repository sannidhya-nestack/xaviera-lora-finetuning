Hey let's go off to the playground
All our friends will be there too
Hey let's go it's time to play now
Fun for me and you
My favorite thing is the merry-go-round
It spins fast, hang on tight
I like the slide and the monkey bars
And the tire to swing that goes so high
Hey let's go off to the playground
One for me and you
Hey let's go down to the beach
Villes and castles by the sea
Hey let's go it's gonna be
Fun for you and me
Boat on a swimsuit pack a lunch
Mom's in the car and ready to roll
The sun is shining the waves are small
I hope the water's not too cold
Hey let's go down to the beach
Fun for you and me
Hey, let's go up in my treehouse
Climb the ladder, don't look down
Hey, let's go up in the tree top
Fawn above the ground
We'll make new friends when the birds stop by
To chirp in the branches far above
If we see an ass, be real quiet
We don't want to wake the baby birds up
Hey let's go up in my treehouse
Fun above the ground
Hey let's go to the treehouse
Playground and beach
Fun for you and me
Hey let's go
