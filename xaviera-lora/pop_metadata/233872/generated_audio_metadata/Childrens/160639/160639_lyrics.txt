Find a sparrow, take her home, mend her broken wing
Take your sister in your arms and teach her everything
Put a penny in the old man's hat, kiss your mama's hand
Wipe the baby's tears away, give what you can, give what you can
Put a penny in the old man's hat, kiss your mama's hand
Wipe the baby's tears away
Give what you can, give what you can
Find someone who's feeling blue
Sing them a sweet refrain
Take your sister, show her how to ride the happy train (yeah, we have it like that)
Put a penny in the old man's hat (put a penny in the hat)
Kiss your mama's hand (kiss your mama's hand)
