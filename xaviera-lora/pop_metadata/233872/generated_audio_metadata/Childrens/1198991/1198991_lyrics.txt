"Où est ma croissant de chocolat?" asked the girl named Claudette
"Ma jolie fille, what do you mean? You haven't found it yet?"
"No, Mama, I looked and looked, so choc, rocher"
"And now I need to take a rest, I've looked for it all day"
Come back, my little croissant
Where are you hidden? Where have you gone?
Come back, my little croissant
Please come home soon and don't be gone long
Ma jolie fille, how could you lose your croissant de chocolat?
Maybe it's in the kitchen in my favorite cooking pot?
No, maman, I looked and looked à travers l'océan terri.
I think my croissant has run away and is hiding far from me.
Come back.
My little croissant
Where are you hidden? Where have you gone?
Come back, my little croissant
Please come home soon and don't be gone long
Come back, my little croissant
Where have you run? Oh where have you gone?
Come back, my little croissant
I need a snack and you are bonbon
