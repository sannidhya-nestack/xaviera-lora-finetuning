You say hippo, I say papatimus
You say pancakes, I like a malatimus
Hippopotamus, pancake-a-lotimus
I walka walka walka and I stop stop stop
Hey look at me, I'm talking to you
Maybe I look a little small like Mr. Magoo
But I got something to say, make me wanna shout
I tell you how it is, what I'm talking about
I got a cool band-aid'cause I got a little bruise
Snap time is a-coming, gonna drink a little juice
Mama dropped me off, gonna play with my friends
Then mommy come right back, she come back again
Fifi, filia-oh
Fifi, filia-oh-oh-oh-oh
Free fire, filial, strummin' on the old banjo
You say hippo, I say hippopotamus
You say pancakes, I like a melodamous
Hippopotamus, pancake-a-lot-a-mus
I walk her, walk her, walk her and I stop, stop, stop
I got shoes light up when I jump and jump and wriggle
Got a tooth right here, does a wiggle wiggle wiggle
When that tooth falls out, gonna go under my pillow
Then that fairy's gonna come, gonna make that fairy giggle
Let me show you this, let me tell you that
I got a new yappy puppy, got a furry kitty cat
When my mama's so busy, my daddy's at his job
Me, I'm silly chillin' with my homie SpongeBob
Fee-fi-fiddle-ee-i-oh
Fee-fi-fiddle-ee-i-oh oh oh oh
Free fire, fillet-o, strummin' on the old banjo
You say hippopotamus, I say popotamus
You say pancakes, I like a melodamous
Hippopotamus, pancake-a-lotamus
I walk her, walk her, walk her and I stop, stop and stop
Did you see my mama's tummy?
Gettin' strangely bigger, you know what they told me
Gonna have a baby sister, gonna give her a toy
Gonna love her a lot, maybe she'll be a boy or a baby robot
It seeped, the sea spider went up the water spout
Down came the rain and it washed the spider out
Sun come out, chased away the rain
Spider crawled right up, right up the spout again
Fee-fi-fee-li-a-oh
Fee-fi-fee-li-a-oh-oh-oh-oh
Fifa, filiao, strummin' on the old banjo
You say hippo, I say hippopotamus
You say pancakes, I like'em allotomous
Hippopotamus, pancakes allotomous
I walk her, walk her, walk her and I stop, stop, stop
I walk her, walk her, walk her and it's stop, stop, stop
I walk her, walk her, walk her and it's stop, stop, stop
