Broccoli came from Italy
And it's packed full of vitamin C
It looks just like a tiny tree
Let's eat some broccoli
Although it's green it can be purple too
The Romans ate it and so can you
It's nice on its own or in a stew
So let's all munch and chew
Stir fry it or steam it, lots of ways to eat it
Boil it in a big fat pot
Roast it in the oven, share it with your cousin
This vegetable we like a lot
Broccoli tastes good to me
But it's a funny word, I'm sure you agree
It's from the Italian for "ahm, you see?"
That veg called broccoli (ciao, amico!)
Broccoli makes your bones grow strong
It's good for our hearts, so deserves this song
But just make sure it isn't cooked too long
If it's mushy, then that is wrong
Still fry it or steam it, lots of ways to eat it
Boil it in a big fat pot
Roasted in the oven, eat the florets'cause we love them
Have them hot or have them hot
Broccoli came from Italy
And it's packed full of vitamin C
It looks just like a tiny tree
Let's eat some broccoli
Let's eat some broccoli
Let's eat some broccoli
