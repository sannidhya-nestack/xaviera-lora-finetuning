I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
What Patty can possibly do
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
What Patty can possibly do
She can help out a friend
Write letters to send
Make things with paper and glue
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
What Patty can possibly do
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
What Molly can possibly do
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
What Molly can possibly do
She can play with the blocks
Or draw things with chalk
Count to a hundred and two
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
What Molly can possibly do
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
What Courtney can possibly do
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
What Courtney can possibly do
She can dance'round the floor, line up by the door
Paint pictures of gold, green and blue
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
What Courtney can possibly do
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
What you can possibly do
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
What you can possibly do
Play music and sing
You could do anything
Everything there is to do
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
What you can possibly do
