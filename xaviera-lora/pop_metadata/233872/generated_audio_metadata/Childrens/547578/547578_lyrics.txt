Lightbug, lightbug, funny little lightbug
Glowing in the dark in my room tonight
Lightbug, lightbug, funny little lightbug
Flying'round the dark with your pale blue light
No one sees you but me
When I wake up in my dreams
You sing a song that I like to sing
Makes me wanna laugh out loud
Light bug, light bug, funny little light bug
Glowing in the dark in my room tonight
Light bug, light bug, funny little light bug
Flying'round the dark with your pale blue light
When mom and dad are asleep
That's when you come to me
And where we'll go is a mystery
I can't wait'til I close my eyes
Light, light, lightbug, fly, lightbug
Glow in the dark in my room tonight
Light, light, lightbug, fly, lightbug
Flying round the dark with your pale blue light
I touch your wing and fly
Round the world just you and I
Before the sun opens up his eyes
I'm safe back in my bed just in time
Lightbug, lightbug, funny, funny lightbug
Glowing in the dark in my room tonight
Lightbug, lightbug, funny, funny lightbug
Flying round the dark with your pale blue light
