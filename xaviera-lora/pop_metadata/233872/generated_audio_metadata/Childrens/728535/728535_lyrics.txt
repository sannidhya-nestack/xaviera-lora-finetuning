Do your ears hang high? Do they reach up to the sky?
Do they droop when they're wet? Do they stiffen when they're dry?
Can you listen to your neighbor with the minimum of labor?
Do your ears hang high?
Do your ears flip flop
Can you use them for a mop
Are they stringy at the bottom
Are they curly at the top
Can you use them for a swatter
Can they soak a lot of water
Do your ears flip flop
Do your ears hang out? Can you wiggle them about?
Can you flip them up and down as you're flying around the town?
Do you like hip-hop or do you like to rock?
Do your ears hang out?
Hey hey
Yeah yeah
Alright
Yup
