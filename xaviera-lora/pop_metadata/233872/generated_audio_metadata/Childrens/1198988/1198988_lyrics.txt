The big bear used to swear he had trouble falling asleep,
but then he learned a simple trick to help him go down deep.
He starts his bedtime ritual by brushing his big bear teeth.
Then he washes his big bear fur before he slides into his clean bed sheets.
He pats his big bear pillow to make it soft and pretends it's a cloud.
He lowers his big bear voice to be very quiet instead of loud.
He gently crawls into his big bear bed and lays his furry body down.
He makes sure he has a smile on his face instead of a sour frown.
He breathes in a deep big bear breath and lets out a big bear sigh.
He wraps himself in his big bear blanket with his peaceful paws at his side.
And then when his ritual is all complete, and his big bear worries are gone, he finally relaxes deeply and lets out his big bear yawn.
Goodnight big bear, goodnight little bear, goodnight to the baby bears too.
Goodnight big bear, goodnight little bear, I am so very proud of you.
