Sometimes they're hairy with fangs to bite, that's true
Claws to capture other critters too
A sting is fiddled from some of them, it's just what they do
Their eyes are bulging as they slither on the ground
They look like aliens, a new world has been found
Antenna reach for the sky as they fly around and round
You can't judge a bug by its cover
You've got to understand one another
You can't judge a bug by its cover
There's more inside
They seem so strange when we see their outer side
Even sometimes scary makes you wanna run and hide
Underneath they live and breathe and laugh and cry
That's why
You can't judge a bug by its cover
We've got to understand one another
You can't judge a bug by its cover
There's more inside
Nature, part of nature's song
Let's all sing along
You can't judge a bug by its cover
We've got to understand one another
You can't judge a bug by its cover
There's more inside
Oh, you can't judge a bug by its cover
We've got to understand one another
You can't judge a bug by its cover
There's more inside, that's why
