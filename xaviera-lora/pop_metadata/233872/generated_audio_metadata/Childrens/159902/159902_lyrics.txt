I've got trouble, I've got big trouble
I'm sitting in my house on Willow Street
And I love this house and I love this street
A prettier house you'll never meet
And I like where I am
Yes, I like where I am
And that's why I've got trouble
But I'm just kinda, you know, sittin' just messin' around with Mimi's kitten
That's Mimi over there in the little red chair
She's usually got food in her hair
And she's only three so it's really not fair
she's got a kitten and I don't
And I'm six
Well anyway, I'm sitting with a kitten and a piece of string
Just listening to my mama sing
La la, la la, la la, la la, and I like where I am
I'm sitting around and a truck pulls up and it's really big
It's red and big with two big men
The really big men who say
Hi son can we come in please
Two men as big and strong as trees
They make me feel all wobbly knees
They say, "Hi, son" and that means me
And that means I've got trouble
They say, "Hey, son, it's moving day"
That's right, it's moving day
They're gonna pick us up and take us away
And I think, although I dare not say
Oh why don't you just go away
Take your truck and take your trouble
And move somebody else
'Cause I like my room and I like my school
And we live real close to a swimming pool
My best friend lives around the block
Why move to a place called Little Rock anyway?
And the two big men they kinda chuckle at me with a ho ho ho and a he he he
And mama takes me on her knee and sings a gentle song to me
And rocks me back and forth
And we watch those men walk back and forth with a ho ho ho and a he he he
My tears drop down on mama's knee
La la (la la)
They pack all our stuff in their truck
Look there goes Mimi's rubber duck
And my new mitt
And all of Mama's music books
Look Dad's pajamas
Everything goes they say with glee
With a ho ho ho and a he he he
And I know I've got trouble
'Cause I like my room and I like my school
And we live real close to the swimming pool
My best friend lives around the block
Why move to a place called Little Rock?
Anyway
But we did
Just like that
And guess what?
What?
Do you know what?
What?
We moved to a place called Little Rock
And my new friend lives just up the block
And he has got a swimming pool
My room's okay and somewhere's cool
And I got my own kitten
And I still think of Willow Street
The memory is very sweet
I'll always love where I was born
But when I wake up in the morning
I like where I am
Do the ho-ho-ho-hee-hee-hee
I like where I am
