Speed, bonny boat, like a bird on the wing
Onward the sailors cry
Carry the lad that's born to be king
Over the sea to sky
Loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar
Thunder claps rend the air
Baffled are foes, stand by the shore
Follow they will
Will not dare speed bonnie boats like a bird on the wing
Or would the sailors cry?
Carry the lad that's born to be king over the sea to sky
Though the waves leap
Softly, softly sleep
Ocean's a royal bed
Wrapped in the deep
Flora will keep
Watch by your weary head
Speed, bonny bones
Like a bird on the wing
Onward the sailors cry
Carry the land that's born to be king Over the sea to sky
Many still land fought on that day While the Claymore could wield
When the night came, silently lay
Dead in Culloden's field
Speeds bonnie boats like a bird on the wing
Onward the sailors cry
Carry the lad that's born to be king
Over the sea to sky
Burned all their homes, exile and death
Scattered the loyal men
Yet her the sword, cool in the sheath
Charlie will come again
Speeds bonnie bones like a bird on the wing
Onward the sailors cry
Carry the lad that's born to be king Over the sea to sky
Carry the lad that's born to be king Over the sea to sky
