Horses trot by the wooden gate
Cows all munch, they just can't wait
Sheep bleat softly in the grass
Donkeys bray as we watch them pass
Clap your hands and tip your hat
Sing along with dog and cat
Roll with laughter in the hay
Farmyard friends are here to stay
Farmyard fun, oh can't you see
All these critters dancing free
Farmyard fun, let voices ring
Watch us skip and twirl and sing
Ducklings waddle by the pond
Piglets roll where mud's upon
Gentle goats nibble the weeds
All around bright laughter leads
Clap your hands and tip your hats
Sing along with dog and cat
Roll with laughter in the hay
Farmyard friends are here to stay
In the breeze we twirl around
Hooves and feathers fill the ground
Joyful hearts in perfect tune
Every moment feels brand new
Farmyard fun, oh can't you see
All these critters dancing free
Farmyard fun, let voices ring
Watch us skip and swirl and sing
Now it's time to wave goodbye
Silly smiles we can't deny (we can't deny)
Carry on with cheerful play
Find our joy, lights up our day
