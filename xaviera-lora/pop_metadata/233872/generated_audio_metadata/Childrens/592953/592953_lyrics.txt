Tiny creature, how strange you look
A big large head, long legs that hook
Tales told of you in the deep
Where darkness hides, green grass leaves
Wish you could talk to me at night
Wish you could come up when it's light
Oh tiny creature you've given me hope
Not everyone feels like they're alone
The more I watch I'm digging those moves
Flowing through water with your own little groove
I hear music that calls your name
Mr. Octopus, oceans will never be the same
Wish you could talk to me at night
Wish you could come up where it's light
Oh tiny creature, you've given me hope
Not everyone feels like they're alone
Wish you could talk to me at night
Wish you could come up where it's light
Oh tiny creature, you've given me hope
Not everyone feels like they're alone
Wish you could talk to me at night
Wish you could come up where it's light
Oh tiny creature, you've given me hope
Not everyone feels like they're alone
Wish you could talk to me at night
Wish you could come up where it's light
Oh tiny creature, you've given me hope
Not everyone feels like they're alone
