Hey, let's pretend that our hands are cars and we're gonna take'em to the car wash
I've got a sporty red car, what kind of car do you have?
Now we can't roll up our car windows, but we can roll up our sleeves
Let's start our engines and drive our hands into the water
I'm gonna wash, wash, wash
Wash my hands, I'm gonna wash, wash, wash and get'em clean
I'm gonna wash, wash, wash, wash my hands
I'm gonna wash, wash, wash and get them clean
Ooh watch out! Here comes the soap! Just like in the car wash!
Gee look at all the bubbles sliding down our cars
I'm gonna soap, soap, soap, soap my hands
I'm gonna soap, soap, soap and get'em clean
I'm gonna soap, soap, soap, soap my hands
I'm gonna soap, soap, soap and get them clean
Okay, just like on your parent's car
We've gotta get the soap off
So here comes the rinse cycle
Don't get sprayed
I'm gonna rinse, rinse, rinse
Rinse my hands
I'm gonna rinse, rinse, rinse and get'em clean
I'm gonna rinse, rinse, rinse, rinse my hands
I'm gonna rinse, rinse, rinse and get them clean
I'm gonna dry, dry, dry, dry my hands
I'm gonna dry, dry, dry and now we're done
