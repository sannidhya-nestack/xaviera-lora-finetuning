Rain rain go away come again another day
Rain rain go away come again another day
Pitter patter pitter patter pitter patter pitter patter
I hear thunder, I hear thunder
Hark don't you, hark don't you
Pitter patter raindrops, pitter patter raindrops
I'm wet through, so are you
I see blue skies, I see blue skies
Way up high
Way up high
Hurry up the sunshine
Hurry up the sunshine
We'll soon dry
We'll soon dry
I hear thunder
I hear thunder
It's about to rain, come again another day
I'm wet through, come again another day
