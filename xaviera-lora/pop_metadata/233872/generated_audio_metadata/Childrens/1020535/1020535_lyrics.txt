Five little monkeys jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head
So mama called the doctor and the doctor said
No more monkeys jumping on the bed
All little monkeys jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head
So Mama called the doctor and the doctor said
No more monkeys jumping on the bed
Three little monkeys jumping on the bed
One little fan bumped his head
So Mama called the doctor and the doctor said
No more monkeys jumping on the bed
Two little monkeys jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head
The mama called the doctor and the doctor said
No more monkeys jumping on the bed
One little monkey jumping on the bed
Two fell off and bumped his head
So mama called the doctor and the doctor said
No more monkeys jumping on the beds
There is a monkey a-strumpin' on the bed
And fell off and bumped his head
To my back what the doctor and the doctor said
But there's monkeys back in bed
