"Lost, a Calico kitten," the newspaper said, "with a cluster of stripes on the top of her head, spots of white on her stomach and white on her chest. Please return her to 17 Prospect Park West."
It was quiet where Lucy and Eleanor sat, while they waited for someone to bring back their cat.
On the shelf in the pantry, to add to the pity, were cat food, a dish, and a saucer marked Kitty.
"This isn't the first cat to pick up and leave," said their mother.
"Don't carry your heart on your sleeve. All cats like to wander, all cats like to roam,
But sooner or later they're sure to come home."
But the two little girls were as sad as before,
Until suddenly somebody knocked at the door.
"How'd it do?" said a gentleman, doffing his hat. "Would you folks be the party that's missing the cat?"
In a hamper of straw, in a small furry heap, Was a calico kitten all curled up asleep.
Lucy's voice sounded faint and a little bit flat.
"I'm so sorry," she said, "but that isn't my cat."
"What's the difference?" he asked her.
"You'll soon want another, and this little kitty cat can't find her mother."
While Lucy was thinking of what she should say,
He had put down the basket and gone on his way.
In his place were five strangers, each doffing his hat,
And each one of them holding a calico cat.
"Half a dozen," her mother cried, "merciful heavens!
They'll have all our household at sixes and sevens!
That's six times the trouble and six times the cost!
And not one of them looks like the kitten we lost !"
While her mother protested and worried and quivered,
Another collection of cats was delivered.
"More kittens !" she cried, "keep them out of the way!
Or whatever will Harriet H. have to say?"
