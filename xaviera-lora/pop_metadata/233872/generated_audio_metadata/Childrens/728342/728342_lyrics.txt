I've been working on the railroad all the live long day
I've been working on the railroad just to pass the time away
Can't you hear the whistle blowing
Rise up early in the morning
Can't you hear the captain shouting
Donna blow your horn
Dinah won't you blow
Dinah won't you blow
Dinah won't you blow your horn
Dinah won't you blow
Dinah won't you blow
Dinah won't you blow your horn
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Someone's in the kitchen I know
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Strummin' on the old banjo
Fee-fi-fiddly-hi-ho
Fee-fi-fiddly-hiho
Fee-fi-fiddly-hi-ho
Strummin' on the old banjo
I've been workin' on the railroad
All the lives long day
I've been workin' on the railroad
Just to pass the time away
Can't you hear the whistle blowin'?
Rise up early in the morning
Can't you hear the captain shouting
Donna blow your horn
Donna won't you blow
Donna won't you blow
Donna won't you blow your horn
Donna won't you blow
Donna won't you blow
Donna won't you blow your horn
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Someone's in the kitchen I know
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Strummin' on the old banjo
Fee-fah-fiddly-ah-oh
Fee-fah-fiddly-yah-oh
Fee-fah-fiddly-yah-oh
Strummin' on the old banjo
I've been working on the railroad all the live long day
I've been working on the railroad just to pass the time away
Can't you hear the whistle blowin'
Rise up early in the morning
Can't you hear the captain shoutin'
Donna blow your horn
