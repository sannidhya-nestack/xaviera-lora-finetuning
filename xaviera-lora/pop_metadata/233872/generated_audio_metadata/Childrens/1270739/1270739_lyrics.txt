Sights and sounds of the sea
I hear you calling me
Sadly I had to go
Oh how I miss you so
Don't know how long it has been
It seems an eternity
Nothing means more to me than the sights and sounds of the sea
Waves crash onto the shore, whoosh, splash
Sounds I adore
Small crustaceous peeps at my hood
Know if I could be with you I would
And if I had some wings
I'd fly to you and stay forever
Oh, I'd never leave the sights and sounds of the sea
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Waves crash onto the shore
Whoosh, splash, sounds I adore
Small crustaceous beeps of my hood
Know if I could be with you I would
And if I had some wings
I fly to you and say
Forever, oh, I never leave
Freeman, I just don't agree
Though nothing is more dear to me than the sights and sounds
Sights and sounds
Sights and sounds
Of the sea
