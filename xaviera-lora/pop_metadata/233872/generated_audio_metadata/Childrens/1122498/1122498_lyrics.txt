Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wish you weren't so far
If I could, I'd learn to fly
And go and see you in the sky
Little star, shine so bright
That the world may see your light
Little star, my delight
You're welcome every night
Unlike other stars I see
You will always speak to me
And this is what I hear you say
Come on out, let's go play
Little star, shine so bright
That the world may see your light
Little star, my delight
You're welcome every night
You're the only star I know
Oh, smile upon the earth below
And that is why I think it's true
That you know me and I know you
Little star, shine so bright
That the world may see your light
Little star, my delight
You're welcome every night
Little star, shine so bright
That the world may see your light
Little star, my delight
You're welcome every night
You're welcome every night
You're welcome every night
