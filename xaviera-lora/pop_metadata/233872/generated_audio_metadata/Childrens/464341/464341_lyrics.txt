I can't find my room, it used to be there
I searched the whole house but it's not anywhere
The door's still standing where it always did
But the rest of my room is lost or it's hid
I can't find my room
I can't find my room
Oh sure there is something wedged in the door
A pile of trash from the ceiling to floor
I recognize the sock in one of my shirts
And my football stuck under mountains of dirt
But I can't find my room
I can't find my room
Find my room, he can't find it, no he can't find it
He can't find it, no he can't find it
I can't find my room, it used to be there
I searched the whole house but it's not anywhere
The door is still standing where it always did
But the rest of my room is lost or it's hidden
I can't find my room
I can't find my room
He can't find it, no he can't find it
He can't find it, no he can't find it
He can't find it, no he can't find it
He can't find it, no he can't find it
He can't find it, no, he can't find it (he can't find his own)
He can't find it, no, he can find it (he can't find his own)
He can't find it, no, he can find it (he can't find his own)
He can't find it, no, he can find it (he can't find his own)
He can't find it, no, he can find it
