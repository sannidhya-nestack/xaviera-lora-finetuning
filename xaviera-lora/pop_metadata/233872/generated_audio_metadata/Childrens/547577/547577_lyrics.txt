Take that night train to Memphis
Take that night train to Memphis
And when you arrive at the station
I'll be right there to meet you
I'll be right there to greet you
So don't turn down my invitation
Have a great day on the railway
Climb aboard we're going for a ride
Oh you'll never be the same
Once you ride aboard a train
You'll be singing kids love trains forevermore
Oh, you'll never be the same
Once you ride aboard a train
You'll be singing kids love trains forever more
