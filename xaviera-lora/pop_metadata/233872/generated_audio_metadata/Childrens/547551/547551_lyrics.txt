One little elephant went out to play
Out on a spider's web one day
He really had such enormous fun
That he called for another little elephant to come
Oh, two little elephants went out to play
Out on a spider's web one day
They really had such enormous fun
That they called for another little elephant to come
Wow, three elephants!
Three little elephants went out to play
Out on a spider's web one day
They really had such enormous fun
That they called for another little elephant to come
Gosh, now there's four
Four little elephants went out to play
Out hunting spiders web one day
They really had such enormous fun
That they called for another little elephant to come
That's a lot of elephants
Five little elephants didn't want to play
Out on a spider's web all day
One little elephant said goodnight
And they all watched till he was out of sight
See you later dude
Four little elephants didn't want to play
Out on a spider's web all day
One little elephant said goodnight
And they all watched'til he was out of sight
Three little elephants didn't want to play
Out on a spider's web all day
One little elephant said goodnight
And they all watched till he was out of sight
Hey where's everybody going anyway?
Two little elephants didn't wanna play
Out on a spider's web all day
One little elephant said goodnight
And they all watched till he was out of sight
Well I guess it's just me left now heh
Yop yop yop yop
One little elephant didn't want to play
Out on the spider's web all day
This little elephant said goodnight
And the spider watched'til he was out of sight
Boop boop boop boop boop boop
Do do do do do do do do
Oh, see you later, spider. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
