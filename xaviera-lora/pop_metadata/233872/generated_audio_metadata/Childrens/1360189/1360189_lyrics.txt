Oh, I feel it in my knees, can you?
Let the silly squiggles start to shine, prove
On your soft slippery shoes I'm feeling kinda twisty
Jelly bean jitters zip zap through my toes and fingers
I'm tickled by the twirling tap, the table tap, the air
Every part's a puzzle piece, popping with a giggle
Fey you twizzle and twizzle to the tippy top tree
Or swizzle and swerve with the breezy bumblebee
This is my wiggle parade
Hands high in fizzy flow
Bounce, bend, sway and leap
Everybody's got a wiggle to show
Silly spaghetti, jumping jam
Bounce the banana away
Bubbly buzzing cheeks and chin
Dizzier by the day
Scooter scoots in circles
Slipper slip and glide
Hey hop with me forever
No need to hide
Can you do the noodles and doodles with knees
Or swizzle and swerve with bubble bee breeze
This is my wiggle parade
Hands high in fizzy fluff
Bounce then sway and leap
Everybody's got a wiggle to show (go with me now)
Wobbly, wibble, whirly, wham, wiggly wonderwall
If you're feeling fluttery, come join and have a ball
Wild delight, wave your wobbles dance through the night
Crowns bend, sway and leap
Show off your wiggle, no need for sleep
Carry wiggle and giggle, walk around
Five bouncy boys to shake the sound
With your pony, your twinkle, feel the spin all around
