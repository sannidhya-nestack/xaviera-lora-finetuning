We build a tiny track on the living room floor
Chugging round the sofa always wanting more
Bright colored wagons line up with the cheer
All aboard for fun no worries here
Little toy train oh little toy train
Rolling round and round never feeling pain
Little toy train oh little toy train
Bringing happy smiles again and again
We wear conductor hats feeling extra proud
Huffing like engines our whistles ring loud
Through every hallway
We travel with glee
Adventure is ours
For all to see
Keep this joy inside
Shining day by day
Choo choo dreams and laughter
Lighting up our way
We pass our teddy friends
Waving as we go
Imagination sparks with each gentle blow
Every beep and toot
Echoes far and clear
In our playful world
Magic is near
Little toy train, oh little toy train
Rolling round and round never feeling plain
Little toy train, oh little toy train
Bringing happy smiles again and again
Little toy train
Stay close and true
Chugging in our hearts the whole day through
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Little toy train, stay close and true
Chugging in our hearts the whole day through
