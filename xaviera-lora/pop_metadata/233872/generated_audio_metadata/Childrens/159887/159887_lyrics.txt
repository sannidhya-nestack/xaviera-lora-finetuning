I dreamed I went to Egypt in a pink wheelbarrow
I danced across the desert with a very friendly pharaoh
And then I floated skyward and I chatted with the sphinx
Then I lay down in the sand and grabbed my forty winks
Ooh la la, la la la, ooh la la, la la la
I dreamed my little bedroom had a garden for a rug
Which featured every single type of common garden bug
And it sprouted tons of roses in lots of kinds of paints
Oh man
You know I really love those forty wings singing
La la la la la la la la la la la la
Do do do do do do do do do do
I dreamed I went to Charlie's store to buy some rubber bands
And Charlie was a centipede with fifty pairs of hands
And he washed them before bedtime in fifty tiny sinks
He put on his nightcap and laid down for forty weeks singing
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
I dreamed I was a very famous champion ice skater
My skating partner was a green and handsome alligator
We skated beautiful duets on lots of lovely rinks
And after every pas de deux
We both got forty weeks singing
Na-na-na-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
I dreamed my children went to bed and slept all through the night
And I went in to watch them and it was a lovely sight
