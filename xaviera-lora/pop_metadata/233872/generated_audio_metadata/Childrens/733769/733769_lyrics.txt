Sweet dreams, little blue eyes
Sleep long and sleep tight
The sandman will be by
To kiss you goodnight
Old friends are waiting for you and your teddy
Soon you'll be heading
To the land of sweet dreams
You'll climb marshmallow mountains
And candy cane trees
Sail a gingerbread robot
Down a buttermilk stream
Play with little boy Blue
And dance with Bo Peep
So sleep little blue eyes and dream sweet dreams
You'll climb marshmallow mountains and candy cane trees
Sail a gingerbread rowboat down a buttermilk stream
Play with little boy
And dance with old people
So sleep little blue eyes and dream sweet dreams
So sleep little blue eyes
Little blue eyes sweet dreams
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
