Tooty, caboosey, tooty, tooty, the caboosey
I'm Tooty Caboosey, I'm an engineer
I drive a choo-choo train to there from here
Before I take a trip, I look at the caboose
To see if the hitches are coming loose
Pardon me kids, but did I mention
I never et to chickety check the engine
I yell all aboard the Santa Fe
Gotta push on out of the station and start my day
Tutti Kabboussi, he's driving the train
Delivers the freight through the sun, snow and rain
Inspecting his train before he goes on his way
He's making many stops today
Choo-choo, choo-boogie and a clickety-clack
Here comes a train coming down the track
Steaming and streaming on down the line
She's a clean machine and she's looking fine
Gonna keep on moving so I'll be on time
Gotta make it to Topeka by a quarter to nine
So climb on board, I can't wait
Gotta move on down the line and deliver the freight
Tutti Kabboussi, he's driving a train
Delivers the freight through the sun, snow and rain
He drives his train across the state
And he is never late
Tutti Kabboussi, Tutti Kabboussi
Two raffin' by the farm and the sky's still blue
The rooster he's a-sayin' cock-a-doodle-doo
Horses in the farmhouse eatin' their hay
The chickens in the barn layin' eggs all day
Mr. Piggy he's rollin' in the mud
The cows are in the pasture chewin' their cud
Old Yellow's in the doghouse barkin' up a storm
Old Palmer Jones in the field fertilizin' corn
Tootie
He's driving a train, delivers the freight through the sun, snow and rain
Waving to the animals passing Jones' farm
You can hear the chickens clucking from inside the barn
Tooty, caboosey, driving a train
T-R-A-I-N are the letters
Take a ride with Tootie
Nothing could be better
I've been working on the railroad
The live long day
On the edges of Topeka and Santa Fe
Been an engineer for most of my life
Every night they come home to my kids and my wife
Kids are in their basements
Playing a game
They're building a route for their electric train
I ask them when they grow up
Just what they want to be
Basic an engineer
Just like me
Tooty Caboosey, he's driving a train
Delivers the freight through the sun, snow and rain
When his kids are grown up, they'll know just what they'll do
They're gonna be like Tooty Caboose, oh yeah
They're gonna be like Tooty Caboose
