Dinosaur's big, roar loud, roar, there'll be no crowd
Tongue tied, let's roar, roar, dinosaurs galore
Dinosaur's big, roar loud, dinos hearing dinos crowd
Tongue tied, let's explore
Worker, we want more!
Worker, stop around!
Worker, they don't sound!
Worker, let's all play!
Worker, every day!
Dinosaurs, swish and sway
Stopping feet, coming out and play
Dinosaurs dancing, having fun
Rolling under the pressure
With T-Rex, you are so loud
Stegosaurus, standing proud
Charizard, three big horns
Dinosaurs, all shapes and forms
Shark, stop around
Let's all play, work, girl, everyday
Dino tails, fish and play
Stomping feet, come out and play
Dinos dancing, having fun
Rolling under the bright sun
Empty racks, roar so loud
Stegosaurus, standing proud
Triceratops, three big horns
Dinosaurs, all shapes and forms
Barker, stop around
Barker, bring your sound
Barker
Let's all play, war, girl, every day
Dinosaurs swish and sway
Scorpions eat, come out and play
Dinosaurs dancing, having fun
Rolling under the pressure
Girl, stop around
Worker, they don't sell
Worker, let's all play
Worker, everyday
Dino tails swish and sway
Stomping feet come out and play
Dinos dancing having fun
Roaring under the bright sun
