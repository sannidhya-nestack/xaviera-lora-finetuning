There's a girl who I know
Got a zebra in her shoe
She got a tiger in her pocket
She's like a little zoo
There's a lion in her lap
And a blue fish in her blouse
Keeps a cobra in her car
And you should see what's in her house
Sing hey now
Listen now sing what I say
Keep a tiger in your pocket
Have a happy day
When I visit my friend
The gorilla gets the door
He smiles and takes my hat and coat
But I know he wants more
Her elephants are elegant
And they do the jungle dance
She got leopards in all kinds of spots
And ants in her plants
Sing hey now
Listen now
Sing what I say
Keep a tiger in your pocket, have a happy day
Once her life was easy, just a goldfish in her purse
Then a monkey, then a cat, now the situation's worse
She has so many animals in every hat and shoe
Once she was just a little girl, but now she's a little zoo
Sing hey now, listen now, sing what I say
Keep the tagger in your pocket, have a happy day
Sing hey now, listen now, sing what I say
Keep the tagger in your pocket, have a happy day
(Crying)
