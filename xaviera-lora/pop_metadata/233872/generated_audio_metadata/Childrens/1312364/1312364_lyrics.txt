We all know we have to clean our mess after we play
But we can make it fun if we can play a dancing game
All we need to do is find a very happy sound
We can pick up all our toys while we just dance around like this
Like this
We need to straighten up our room before we go to school
It isn't right to leave a mess for someone else to do
All we need to do is find a very happy sound
We'll make it neat and tidy while we just dance around like this
Like this
Like this
Cleaning up is not so bad
We can have fun and we can laugh
When we still have songs and we can dance
And put our things away
Like this (like this)
Like this (like this)
