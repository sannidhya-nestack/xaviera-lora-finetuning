Being a rubber ball has its ups and downs
But it's really very easy to turn around and frown
Just hit the floor and off the wall and then you twirl and spin
And pretty soon your frown begins to turn into a grin
You just bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
You just bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, you just bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, you just bounce bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, you just bounce
Oh it can get silly, mostly it's just fun
When you're a rubber ball, the party's just begun
Sure you might get dizzy, chasing us around
But don't you try to follow us, with both feet on the ground
You just bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce bounce bounce you just bounce bounce bounce
Bounce bounce bounce you just bounce bounce bounce
Bounce bounce bounce you just bounce bounce bounce
Bounce bounce bounce you just bounce
Catch your breath, seekers on, only bouncing counts
Grab your hat, here we go, everybody bounce
You just bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
You just bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
You just bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
You just bounce
Everybody bounce
Yeah, you gotta bounce
Ooh, you gotta bounce
Yeah, you gotta bounce
Ooh, yeah, you gotta bounce
Yeah, you gotta bounce
