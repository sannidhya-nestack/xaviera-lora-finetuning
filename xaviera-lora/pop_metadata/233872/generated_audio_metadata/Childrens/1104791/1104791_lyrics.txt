Harry the dinosaur sat on the kitchen floor
He wouldn't go out and play
He didn't sleep last night, he's just not feeling right
So he sat feeling dismayed
I asked him, "Have you got trouble?"
He didn't have much to say
He opened his mouth and pointed within
And groaned in a meaningful way
Oh! I knew just what to do
I made a phone call
The dentist said come straight away
Harry got in the car
Though it was not so far
He wouldn't walk it today
The chair for Harry was ready
The dentist looked once and said, "Oh"
In no time at all he whipped out his drill
Harry, that tooth's got to go, oh
Harry the dinosaur sat on the kitchen floor
Eating a big bale of hay
He's smiling as you can see
Happy as he can be
Without a toothache today
He's smiling as you can see
Happy as he can be
Without a toothache today
Hooray
