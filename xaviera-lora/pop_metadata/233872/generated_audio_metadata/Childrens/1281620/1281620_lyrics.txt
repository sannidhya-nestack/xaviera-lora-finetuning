Shiver me timbers, hearty mates
And ye wanna be candidates
To be a pirate strong and true
There's something first, something ye must do
So let's all sing a perfect pirate song
A catchy tune for us to sing along
Come join our crew, the best to be among
Listen closely, then things can't go wrong
Weigh the anchor, hoist the sails
Tell tall tales that never fails
Scrub the deck and do some chores
Afore ye make a pirate life be yours
So let's all sing a perfect pirate song
A catchy tune for us to sing along
Come join our crew, the best to be among
Listen closely, then things can't go wrong
Fly your flag, sing yo ho ho

Raise your cutlass, then say "arrr"
Then you're pirate, you'll go very far
