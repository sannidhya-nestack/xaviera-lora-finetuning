There was a little bunny with a powderpuff tail
Whipped as he hopped and he'd fill every pail
Right to the top with candies galore
And then he'd take some eggs and he'd do a little more
A hippity hop, a hippity hop
The powderpuff bunny he would not stop
A hippity hop, a hippity hop
All around the world he went bop bop bop
Some eggs were pink, some eggs were green
Some were every colour you'd ever seen
The Powderpuff Bunny hit everyone
He just wouldn't stop'til his job was done
A hippity hop, a hippity hop
The Powderpuff Bunny, he wouldn't stop
A hippity hop, a hippity hop
All around the world he went bop bop bop
Every place he went he was quiet as a mouse
Passing Easter goodies out at every single house
Then as he was leaving he would hop around and say
Goodbye kids and Happy Easter Day
A hippity hop, a hippity hop
The Pada Pup Bunny he would not stop
A hippity hop, a hippity hop
All around the world he went bop bop bop
A hippity hop, a hippity hop
The butter puff bunny, he wouldn't stop
A hippity hop, a hippity hop
All around the world he went bop bop bop
All around the world he went bop de bop bop
It's so exciting when Easter time is here
I hope you kids are ready
Because here comes Peter Cottontail
