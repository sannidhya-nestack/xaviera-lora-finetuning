This, this, this, this is the house that Jack built
This, this, this, this, this is the house that Jack built
This, this, this is the farmer sowing his corn
That kept the cock that crowed in the morn
That waked the priest all shaven and shorn
That married the man all tattered and torn
K-k-k-kissed the maiden all forlorn
That milked the cow with a crumpled horn
That tossed the dog that worried the cat
K-k-k-killed the rat that ate the malt
That lay in the house, the house that Jack built
This, this, this, this, this is the house that Jack built
This, this, this, this, this, this is the house that Jack built
This, this, this is the farmer sowing his corn
That kept the cock that crowed in the morn
That wake the priest all shaven and shorn
That married the man all tattered and torn
K-k-k-k is the maiden all forlorn
That milked the cow with the crumpled thorn
That tossed the dog that worried the cat
K-k-k-k killed the rat that ate the malt
That lay in the house, the house that Jack built
The house that Jack built
The house that Jack built
