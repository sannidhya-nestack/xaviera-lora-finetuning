Hush little baby don't you cry
Daddy's gonna sing you a lullaby
My love for you is beyond the sky
I'm gonna teach my baby bird to fly
Little fingers little toes
I look at you, you're all aglow
Baby, you're my heart, heart
Baby, you're my heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh yeah, yeah
Sweetest little bundle of joy
You'll always be my baby boy
I still can't believe you're mine
I love you'til the end of time, yeah
Little fingers, little toes
I look at you, you're all aglow
Baby, you're my eyes, eyes
Baby, you're my eyes
Oh, sweet dreams, my angel go to sleep
The whole world's sitting at your feet, yeah
You and I, building castles in the sky
Watch you spread your wings and fly
'Cause baby you're my heart, heart, baby you're my heart
Oh baby boy you're my heart
I'm gonna watch you fly beyond the sky
