Tonight, sweet thoughts fill my heart
Watching my child asleep in the dark
In our house that we built with love
I offer this prayer to heaven above
Bless the child in all of us
Help us to see the truth
If the world was like a sleeping child
It'd be a better place to wake up to
Sweet dreams, my little one
The angels are with you until morning comes
In this room, the promise of peace
Lifts my heart up as I fall to my knees
Bless the child in all of us
Help us to see the truth
If the world was like a sleeping child
It'd be a better place to wake up to
Sleep on, my precious child
You are the hope of a world that's gone wild
In your eyes, the secret unfolds
In my eyes, you'll never grow old
Bless the child in all of us
Help us to see the truth
If the world was like a sleeping child
It'd be a better place to wake up to
If the world was like a sleeping child
It'd be a better place to wake up to
