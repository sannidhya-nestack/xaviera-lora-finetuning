When angels dance, the flowers sing up, up to the sun
Meadow grass green growing glistens
And grasshoppers stopping there hopping all listen
When angels dance, clouds graze like lambs in blue fields of sky
Love falls in tumbling showers
And bumblebees gather sweet rainbows from flowers
When angels dance, a moon full of hugs
Sails upon the night
Tears fly away on silvery wings
And smiles grow laughter like gardens in spring
Oh, happy dance
