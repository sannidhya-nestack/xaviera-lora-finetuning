Sometimes I feel a little wiggly
Like my legs have ants inside
I want to move, I want to wiggle
Can't sit still though I've tried
So what do I do when I'm giggly and squirm?
I'll find a way to bounce so my body can turn
Jump like jelly beans
Wobble and wiggle free
Mama says let's settle down
But my knees say not today
I tap my toes and swing my arms
Let my giggles lead the way
Don't have to go far
You can bounce on the spot
When you feel the fuzzies
Give jumping a shot
(Feel the fuzzies, give jumping a shot)
Jump like jelly beans
Womble and wiggle free
Everybody up, let's reach so high
Wave your hands, pretend to fly
Swish down low like beans in a jar
Hop back up just where you are
Jump like jelly beans, wobble and wiggle free
If you ever feel too wiggly, just remember what you've seen (yummy)
Bouncing together, happy and free, let's jump and be jelly beans
