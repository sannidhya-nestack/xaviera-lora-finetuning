We roam the city side by side
Confidence our guiding tide
Voices bright with joyful flow
Everywhere we choose to go
Laughter rising in the air
Sparking hope we want to share
Standing bold with every stride
Shining strong from deep inside
Hot fire vibes let them glow
Hearts on fire let it show
We stand tall, we're all aligned
High five us, we're intertwined
Lend the glow of evening calls
We reflect in mirrored halls
Trusting steps that never stray
Finding light in every way
Echoes of our silly jokes
Linking all our happy folks
Every smile we can't conceal
Keeps our spirit bright and real
Time cast in the spark we feel
Bound by faith in what is real
Each new note we hold so dear
Fills the sky with boundless cheer
Oh, we won't let go
Oh, let our spirits show
High five vibes, we all belong
United in this timeless song
Carry hope wherever we roam
High five vibes, we're intertwined
