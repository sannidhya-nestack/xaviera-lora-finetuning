It wasn't long ago
I never thought I could feel this way
I never thought I could feel this way again
Don't ask me why
I can feel this good'cause
I'm not really sure if it's above
Let it be understood that
I don't want the cure
Since the world is out of reach
The sun is up and the wind is away
The sun is up and the wind is away with me
Don't ask me why
I can feel it's good'cause
I'm not really sure
If it's the bug
Let it be understood that
I don't want the cure
Sing me a song, bring it along
Just put a smile on my face now darling
Sing me a song, bring it along
Just put a smile on my face now darling
I didn't have a plan
I could've laughed and it would've been clear
I could've laughed and it would've been clear to you
Don't ask me why I can feel this good'cause
I'm not really sure if it's a bug
Let it be understood that
I don't want the cure
Sing me a song, bring it along
Just put a smile on my face now darling
Sing me a song, bring it along
Just put a smile on my face now darling
Smile
