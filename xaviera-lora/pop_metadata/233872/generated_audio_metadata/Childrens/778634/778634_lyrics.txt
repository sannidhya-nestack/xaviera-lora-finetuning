My name is Voyenul, I like to bark at things
I bark at things that crawl and things that flap their wings
I've got a friend that quacks and one that likes to crow
Oh, do you think you can guess the friend's a beau
I've got a friend that swings and hangs from big brass rings
One with great big eyes who rubs his feet to sing
Another one who lives down in the earth
When I want to see him I just dig the dirt
I live on a farm with the chickens and the pigs
I make the chickens fly when I try to dance a jig
I like surprising the cows but they never seem to care
Every time I chase my tail I don't get anywhere
My name is Bo, you know I like to bark at things
I bark at things that crawl and things that flap their wings
I have a friend that quacks and one that likes to crow
Oh, oh, oh
Do you think you can guess
The friends of Bo
Oh, the friends of Bo
The friends of Bo
The friends of Bo
Oh, the friends of Bo
