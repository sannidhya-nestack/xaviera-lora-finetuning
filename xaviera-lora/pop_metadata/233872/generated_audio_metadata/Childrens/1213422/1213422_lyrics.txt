Yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho
Yo-ho, yo-ho, yo -ho, yo-ho, yo-ho
Yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho
We search for the buried treasure for which all of us would die
And follow the path of the treasure map from the ghost of Captain Bly
But we must await'til pieces of eight fulfill our heart's desire
If there ain't no hitch
Then we'll be rich and we can then retire
Yo-ho, yo-ho, buried treasure
Yo-ho, buried treasure
Yo-ho, buried treasure
Let's follow the moon as we shall be soon
The owners of star-lit gold
In the hills to the west there's a buried chest
Or at least is what we're told
Full of gems and of runes and pieces of aid
At last the trail is found
We're on the track, there's no turning back
There's treasure underground
Your home, your home, buried treasure, your home
Buried treasure, your whole buried treasure
We'll plod, plod, plod'til we nod, nod, nod off into our dig, dig sleep
And sing, sing, sing for a jewel ring, oh one which we can keep
We'll dig, dig, dig'til we jig, jig, jig at the sight of precious golden bars
Then we'll fight, fight, fight throughout the night'til we get what should be ours
Yo-ho, yo-ho, merry treasure
Yo-ho, merry treasure
Yo-ho, merry treasure
