I am a bear, I travel with the circus
On my honor I'm a guy that you can sure trust
You really needn't worry'cause I'm just a fuzzy furry circus bear
I am a bear, sometimes I wear a tutu
I'm aware that this is something to get used to
But dancing ballerina bears have got to have something to wear on stage
I put my paws in the air
And try to dance a pirouette
The trainer brings the children near
So my fur they can pet
Oh gosh
After dressing, dancing, petting
I am sure that you can bet
I'm a hungry circus bear
And my tummy is aware
That it's supper time
Oh, I like supper time
I am a circus bear
You may have seen some others
They were probably my sisters and my brothers
There are cousins, aunts and uncles
There are dozens, there are trunkfuls of us bears
There's a lot
I am a bear
And while I dance to and fro
There is something very special that you should know
We like to keep you happy, clapping, laughing all throughout the circus show
I put my paws in the air
And try to dance a pirouette
Try to dance with me
The trainer brings the children near
So my fur they can pet
Well it feels good
After dressing, dancing, petting
I am sure that you can bet
And my tummy is aware
It's gotta be supper time
I sure like my job here at the circus
But I get awful hungry
Sometimes I can work up an appetite just putting my tutu on
It's kinda small and I'm kinda big
Makes me hungry
I like all the kids petting me
Come to think of it, that can make me hungry too
Oh gosh
