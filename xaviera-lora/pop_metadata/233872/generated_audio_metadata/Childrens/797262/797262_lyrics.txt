I have seen the Pacific
Been to Florida and Holland
I'm a clown while in Mexico
But there's a place that's always calling
There are unicorns, there are dragons too
But they're the sociable kind
See turtles and colorful urchins
Like beauty inside of your mind
So much candy, it's all very fancy
Castles covered in snow
You can go there too, there's something just for you
In California Rainbow
There's a train to Vancouver
There are temples in Kyoto
I've seen caves in Kentucky
And that place I love to go
There are unicorns, there are dragons too
But they're the sociable kind
Sea turtles and colorful urchins
Like beauty inside of your mind
So much candy, it's all very fancy
Castles covered in snow
You can go there too, there's something just for you
In California
Rainbow!
South America, North America
Beautiful people all over Africa
Antarctica, Europe and India
Wonderful Asia and Oceania
South America, North America (they're my unicorns, they're my dragons)
Beautiful people all over Africa (to a perfect ship show-off)
Sea turtles and you're full of jams like you do
It's out of your mind
So much candy, it's all very fancy
Castles that are very small
You can go there too, there's something just for you
In California Rainbow
