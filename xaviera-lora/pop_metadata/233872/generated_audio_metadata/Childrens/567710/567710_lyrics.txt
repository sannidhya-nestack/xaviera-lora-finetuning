Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Rough day, rough
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Man of that rough
Rough day, day
Max my dog
He sleeps all day
Just like a log
And when he wants to play, yeah
He knows all he's got to do is say, "Rough"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I've had a rough day, rough
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Man, I've had a rough, rough day
We watch TV
He loves to sit right next to me
And when I make myself a snack
He says, "Make sure to bring back enough"
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I've had a rough day rough
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Well, I've had a rough day too
But when I come home and you're so glad to see me
You help make life a little bit easier
Ooh yes you do
And when I come home and you're so glad to see me
You help make life a little bit easier, rough
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I've had a rough day, rough
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Man of an ruff, ruff, ruff
I've had a ruff, I've had a ruff
I've had a ruff, I've had ruff
I've had a ruff, I've had ruff
I've had a ruff, I've had rough
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Ipad rough, Ipad rough, day rough, day
