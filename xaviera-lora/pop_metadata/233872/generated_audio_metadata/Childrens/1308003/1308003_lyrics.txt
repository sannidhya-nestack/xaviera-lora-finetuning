We gather in the kitchen with a green surprise
Marching side by side it's quite a sight for eyes
Crunchy and courageous they lead the way
Setting off the rhythm for a silly array
Pickle parade, shout it loud
Funny little friends that gather in a crowd
Pickle parade, hip parade
Wobble to the beat as they march all day
Drums made out of boxes give a quirky sound
While pickles in formation wiggle up and down
We clap and we stomp to the wacky tune
In our veggie carnival beneath the afternoon
Hold on to this flavor
Let the laughter stay
Pickles on a mission
Brightening our day
Pickle parade
Shout it loud
Funny little friends that gather in a crowd
Pickle parade, hip hooray
Wobble to the beat as they march all day
We wave little flags in a swirling breeze
Cheering on the heroes of our munchies
A tangy celebration in every single bite
Our pickle parade glowing with delight
Pickle parade, shout it loud
Funny little friends that gather in a crowd
Pickle parade, hip parade
Wobble to the beat as we march all day
Pickle parade, we'll join again
Green and gleeful, leading us to grin
