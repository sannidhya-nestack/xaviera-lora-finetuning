Beautiful night, stars are shining brightly
I can see the moon up in the sky
Close your eyes, rest your weary heads
Go to sleep, little one
Goodnight
Hush now, little one, drift away
May this moment bring peace where you lay
Wrapped in love and warmth divine
This is my dreamer's lullaby
Candles flicker, shadows on the wall
Fire crackling, hear the bedtime call
Sounds have come from passersby
Go to sleep now, close your eyes
Hush now, little one, drift away
May this moment bring peace where you lay
Wrapped in love and warmth divine
This is my dreamer's lullaby
Little one, I see the light in your eyes
It's almost blinding me
Go to sleep, don't you cry
The moon is always by your side
Hush now, little one, drift away
May this moment bring peace where you lay
Wrapped in love and warmth divine
This is my dreamers lullaby
