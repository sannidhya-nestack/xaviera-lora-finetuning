The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching one by one, hurrah hurrah
The ants go marching one by one, the little one stops to suck his thumb
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, boom boom boom
The ants go marching two by two, hurrah hurrah
The ants go marching two by two, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching two by two, the little one stops to tie her shoe
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, boom boom boom
The ants go marching three by three, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching three by three, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching three by three
The little one stops to climb a tree
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, boom boom boom
The ants go marching four by four, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching four by four, hurrah
Hurrah
The ants go marching four by four, the little one stops to shut the door
And they all go marching down to the ground to get out of the way
Boom, boom, boom
The ants go marching five by five, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching five by five, hurrah
Hurrah
The ants go marching five by five, the little one stops to take a dive
And they all go marching, and they all go marching
And they all go marching down to ground
To get out of the way, boom boom boom
