Tick-tock, turn back the clock, in flim and for a spell
Tick-tock, I'm flim and rock, and I have secrets to tell
Long, long, long before the day that you were born
I would look at the bay, but sad was I each morning
Lonely, lonely was I for I needed a friend
Someone who would play with me and make me smile again
Tick-tock, turn back the clock and blimmin' for a spell
Tick-tock, I'm blimmin' rough and I have secrets to tell
One day, after a storm, on the beach I saw
Glares, quarks, and wampanoag, some friends for me I thought
Hey there, you over there, it's hugely pleased I said
But slowly they went away when the tide came in
Tick-tock, turned back the clock, in Plymouth for a spell
Tick-tock, I'm Plymouth Rock and I have secrets to tell
Tick-tock, turned back the clock in Plymouth for a spell
Tick-tock, I'm Plymouth Rock and I have secrets to tell
Children, do listen well for I have secrets to tell
