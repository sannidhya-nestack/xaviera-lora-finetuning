We gather round the table wide
Shoulder to shoulder, side by side
Voices mingle in cozy light
Warmth that makes our hearts feel right
Hey, hey, let's cheer, let's sing
Bound by love in everything
Hands linked tight, we stand as one
Sharing smiles until we're done
Hey, hey, let's cheer, let's sing
Family joys forever ring
Jokes passed on through every year
Memories cherished kept so near
No matter how the seasons flow
This closeness is all we know
Come in close and join the tune
Every laugh can lift the room
We carry stories through each day
Guided by caring in every way
Hearts so bright we set the tone
Never facing life alone
Hey, hey, let's cheer, let's sing
Bound by love in everything
Hands linked tight, we stand as one
Sharing smiles until we're done
Hey, hey, let's cheer, let's sing
Family joys forever ring
As laughter fades into the night
We hold this bond so warm and bright
