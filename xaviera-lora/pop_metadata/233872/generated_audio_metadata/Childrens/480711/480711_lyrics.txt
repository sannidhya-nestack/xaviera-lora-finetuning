Just like the animals down at the zoo
We're all different, me and you
Just like the animals down at the zoo
We're all different, me and you
Stand up if you like blue, stand up if you like pink
Hold your nose and make a face if you have stinky feet
Rub your tummy if you like pizza, I like mac and cheese
Raise your hand if you like pepper, it only makes me sneeze
Ah, ah, ah, ching! It's okay
Just like the animals down at the zoo
We're all different, me and you
Just like the animals down at the zoo
We're all different, me and you
Jump once if you are short
Jump two times if you're tall
Shake your body if you have a pet
Or don't have one at all
Look left for playing outside
Look right for staying in
Even though we're all different
We can still be friends
I'll say it again
Just like the animals down at the zoo
We're all different, me and you
Just like the animals down at the zoo
We're all different, me and you
