Sometimes I see you standing over there
We both pretend that we don't care
Wiggly toes, big silly stare
Is it time?
I take a step you take one too
What happens now what will we do
Why not dance why not spin
Can you laugh will you grin
Is this the secret? Is this the chance?
Why not dance? Why not dance?
You make a face, I cross my eyes
We trade our silly sneaky high five
Jumping sideways, bouncing knees
Is it time? (Is it time? Is it time? Is it time?)
Hop and sway, roll and slide
What if I (What if I)
Just don't hide
Why not dance? Why not spin?
Can you laugh? Will you grin?
Is this the secret? Is this the chance?
Why not dance? Why not dance?
What if friends don't always agree?
We can make up our own kinda party
Stomping, twirling, making noise
Girls and boys, girls and boys
Why not dance? Why not spin?
Can you laugh? Will you grin?
Is this the secret? Is this the chance? Why not dance? Why not dance?
So if you're near don't just stand still Let's wiggle and giggle we always will
