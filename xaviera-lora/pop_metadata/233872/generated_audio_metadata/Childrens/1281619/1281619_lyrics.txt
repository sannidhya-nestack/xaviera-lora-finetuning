Now six years have passed since the treasure was found
The booty has founded this town
Our home where us pirates can live safe and sound
We're the captain of treasured renown
All hail our sports sparkling ocean king
All hail our best buccaneer
All hail the man we're adoring
Let's all sing his name and live here with good cheer
So Barnabas, Bligh and Rowena were wed
By Boston Bill Wiles out at sea
They now have three children all lovely it's said
Completing the Bligh family
All hail our swashbuckling ocean king
All hail our brave buccaneer
All hail the man we're adoring
Let's all sing his name and reveal with good cheer
We all love our town that blind names stow away
The safest of havens there be (oh yeah)
No coast guards nearby, no strict laws to obey
We're all free to conduct piracy
All hail our swashbuckling ocean king
All hail our big parker dear
All hail the man we're adoring
Let's all sing his name and revere with good cheer
Kind Bill the Good Bolson is now the town mayor
He likes to keep people on board
He's tasked with a job that he thinks only fair
Giving good Captain Bly his award
All hail, our swashbuckling ocean king
All hail, our rogue of the year
All hail, the man we're adoring
Let's all sing his name and reveal with good cheer
All hail, House Watch, the King, Ocean King
All hail, the pirate of the year
All hail, the man we're adoring
Let's all sing his name and reveal with good cheer
All hail, the most lovable rogue of the year
