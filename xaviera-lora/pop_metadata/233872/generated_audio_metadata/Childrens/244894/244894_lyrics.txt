The world keeps turning round and round
Different voices, different sounds
In all the places and all of the towns
The world keeps turning round
The world keeps turning round
Listen to the voices
Tell me what you hear
Chinese, Swahili, Russian and Spanish
All ringing in your ears
The world keeps turning round and round
Different voices, different sounds
All the places and all of the towns
The world keeps turning round
The world keeps turning around
Look at all the faces
There's no two alike
Different races and colours
Red, yellow, black and white
Mmm, turn, turn
Never stops
Dust keeps going
Oh the world keeps turning round
The world keeps turning around
Tokyo to London
New York to Timbuktu
So many towns and cities
They're home to me and you
The world keeps turning round and round
Different voices, different sounds
All the places and all of the towns
The world keeps turning round
The world keeps turning round
Round and round and round and round and round and round she goes
Mm-hmm, never stops
The world keeps turning round
The world keeps turning round
