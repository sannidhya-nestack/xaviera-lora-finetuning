In a cottage in a wood
A little old man at the window stood
Saw a rabbit running by
And knocking at the door
Help me, help me, help! he said
Before the farmer shoots me dead
Come little rabbit, come with me
Happy we shall be
In a cottage in a wood
A little old man at the window stood
Saw a rabbit running by
And knocking at the door
Help me, help me, help! he said
Before the farmer shoots me dead
Come little rabbit, come with me
Happy we shall be
