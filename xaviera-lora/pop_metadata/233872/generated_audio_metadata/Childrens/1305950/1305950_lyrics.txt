Lick little puppy, wiggle nose
Tiny paws, how fast he goes
Hops around the yard in glee
Tumbling round so wild and free
Clap your hands, bark along
Puppy prances to our song
Giggle, laugh, skip in line
Everyone's feeling mighty fine
Puppy bounce, puppy bounce
Playful weeks we all announce
Swish your tail, sniff around
Puppy bounce with joyful sound
Woof, woof
Tiny bark, so pure and sweet
Chasing leaves, his daily treat
Nose to ground, a silly show
Tug my trouser with a gentle toe
Clap your hands, bark along
Puppy prances to our song
Giggle laugh
Skip in line, everyone's feeling mighty fine
When Puppy yawns with a little cry
I scoop him up as he draws nigh
Then watch him bounce into more play
He'll chase about all through the day
Puppy bounce, Puppy bounce
Playfully we all announce
Swish your tail, sniff around
Puppy bounce with joyful sound
Woof! Woof!
Little puppy heart so true
We love your wiggle through and through
Bark goodbye but come back soon
Your happy bounce lights up this tune
