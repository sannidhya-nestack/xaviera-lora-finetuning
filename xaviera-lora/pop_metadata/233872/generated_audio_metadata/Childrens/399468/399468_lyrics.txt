I've got beauty and poison grace
I'm the perfect princess to live in this place
I've got style, I'm what he'll adore
Exactly what this prince has been looking for
Pick me and I'll bring you joy
Together we'll have a girl and a boy
Pick me, I'm perfect for you
Don't look any further for my love will do
My dress is expensive, the most in the land
I only wear shoes that sport a name brand
My hair is done by the fairies at night
My friend dies a friend that had lunch with Snow White
Pick me and I'll bring you joy
Together we'll laugh
Of a girl and a boy
Beg me
I'm perfect for you
Don't look any further
For my love will do
Beg me
Please beg me
Beg me
Respect me
