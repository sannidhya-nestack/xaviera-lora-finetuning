The way you are beyond compare
I'd follow you most everywhere
Away we go
I love you so
When you are sad I'll make you smile
For you I'll go the extra mile
I adore you so I'll never go
La la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la
So happy just to be with you
La la la la la, la la la la, La, La, La, La
I'm gonna be so true
Long as the earth spins round that sound
You'll always be my treasured one
Of a kind
So glad you're mine
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Sleep
Don't ever go away
If you leave my heart would break
Cause I adore you so
Don't ever go
