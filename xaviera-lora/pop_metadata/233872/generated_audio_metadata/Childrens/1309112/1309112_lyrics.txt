I wake up, stretch, put my sneakers on
Step outside, the sun is shining strong
I take a little step, then I jump so high
Whoa, did I just touch the sky?
Left foot, right foot, spin around
At every step I take, lifts off the ground
Titty tap, a slide, a groove
I think my shoes have magic moves
There's magic in my shoes
Every step makes me dance somehow
Jump up, shake, twist left and right
These magic shoes feel out of sight
Walking through town with a little beat
My feet are moving, can't stop the heat
Skip to the left, hop to the right
These shoes keep grooving day and night
Left foot, right foot, spin around
Every step I take lifts off the ground
Tippity tap, a slide, a groove
I think my shoes have magic moves
There's magic in my shoes, oh wow
Every step makes me dance somehow
Jump up, shake, twist left and right
These magic shoes feel out of sight
What if I moonwalk?
What if I glide?
What if I jump and touch the sky?
No stopping now, can't slow down
These magic shoes are all around
There's magic in my shoes, oh wow
Every step makes me dance somehow
Jump up, shake, twist left and right
These magic shoes feel out of sight
Stampety tap, swish and slide
Magic shoes take me on a ride
(laughing)
