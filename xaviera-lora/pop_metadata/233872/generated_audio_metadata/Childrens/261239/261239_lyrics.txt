Suppertime around our place seems to be a daily fight
With parents on one side, kids on the other, it's not a pretty sight
It's not a question of psychology, giving bribes or being nice
So if you don't want food on the floor and wall, better listen to some advice
Give me ice creams, hot dogs and Kraft dinner, food that can't be beat
Beans and peas, no thank you please
Give me something good to eat
Give me ice cream, hot dogs and crab dinners
Morning, noon and night
Broccoli and spinach are a waste of time
vegetables I just don't like
There seems to be a problem with the menu
It's a little out of date
Too much food that's good for you with no regard for taste
Parents are so obvious when they pretend to eat my food
And go, "Mm-mm, yummy, it's good for you"
They must think I'm a fool
Give me ice creams, hot dogs and crap dinners
Food that can't be beat
Beans and peas, no thank you
Please give me something good to eat
Give me ice cream, hot dogs, and crab dinner Morning, noon, and night
Broccoli and spinach are a waste of time'Cause vegetables I just don't like
Give me ice cream, hot dogs and Kraft dinners
Food that can't be beat
Beans and peas, no thank you please
Give me something good to eat
Give me ice cream, hot dogs and Kraft dinners
Morning, noon and night
Broccoli and spinach are a waste of time
vegetables I just don't like
Broccoli and spinach are a waste of time
vegetables I just don't like
