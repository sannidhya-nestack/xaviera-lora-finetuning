Hey everybody, it's time to rock and roll (yeah)
Should I change and try to fit in or be true to myself so I can begin
To discover the person in me, not who others expect me to be
Peer pressure, peer pressure
My friends like rude noises, say it's cool to be crude
But sometimes I'm just not in the mood
I wear the name brands like all of the rest
But there are times I don't care how I'm dressed
Peer pressure
Peer pressure
Hey, don't just sit and listen to the CD
Get up, dance, yes you, and be yourself
Let's go!
Freeze! Freeze! Freeze!
Told ya!
I like hip-hop like all my friends do
Listen to oldies as well as the new
I'm not a puppet to pull by the string
Got my own feelings'bout so many things
Peer pressure, peer pressure
Sometimes I won't do things that my friends do
The choices I make they might not approve
I won't change who I am to try and fit in
If I'm not my real self then they weren't my true friends
Peer pressure
Peer pressure
It's time for the peer pressure polka
Come on now
Just kidding
Let's do the Macarena
He's not kidding
Peer pressure
Hear the pressure
Hear the pressure
Hear the pressure
Oh that was so much fun
