I got a great big problem, my mother calls me in
I got a big dilemma'cause I wanna hang with my friends
What should I do? What should I do?
I got the "I don't wanna go" and when my mother calls me home blues
My mother doesn't realize I want to stay out and play
She can't understand I've been working in school all day
There's so much to do
So much to do
I got the I don't wanna going when my mother calls me home blues
I got to shoot some hoops, ride my bike today
Mama don't you see, I gotta air out and play
My day is filled with spelling, walking single file
Don't wanna practice writing, and homework ain't my style
Mom what should I do?
I got the I don't wanna go in
You're driving me crazy
Stop bugging me to come home blues
Mom, dinner's ready!
Come on mom, just five more minutes
Your dinner's getting cold
I want to finish this game
I know my mother loves me
I'm part of the family
I must remember there is someone else beside me
There's someone who cares
My mom's always there
Maybe I'll et about the "I don't wanna go in when my mother calls me home" blues
Maybe I'll et about the "I don't wanna go in when my mother calls me home" blues
Here I come, Mom
