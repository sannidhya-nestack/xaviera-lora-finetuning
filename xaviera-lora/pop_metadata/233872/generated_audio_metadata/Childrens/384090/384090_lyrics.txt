When I close my eyes, you'll still be here
In my heart, my soul, my love
It's my time, you know
For I must go
Sleepy angels are calling me home
Sleepy angels are singing
A sweet lullaby
The bright warm sun shines the light of my life
So goodbye
My love, yes I must go
Sleepy angels are calling me home
So goodbye my love
Yes I must go
Sleepy angels will carry me home
Sleepy angels
Will carry me home
