Just close your eyes
I'll turn out the light
Rest your angel eyes
And soon you will rise
Hush now don't you cry
Daddy's by your side
Seeking you shall find
The dreams of your life
I am near you
I will sing you a song
I will hear you
If you wait for the dawn
I will hold you
If the monster arrives
I will love you
All your life
Lullaby
As we share our life
The years will go by
And you will grow up fast
Right before my eyes
When you choose your path
I'll be right behind
I am near you
I will sing you song
I will hear you
If you wait for the dawn
I will hold you
If the monster arrives
I will love you
All your life
Lullaby
