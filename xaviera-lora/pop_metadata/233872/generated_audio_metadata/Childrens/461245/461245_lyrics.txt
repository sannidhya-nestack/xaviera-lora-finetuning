Hush little baby don't say a word
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
If that mockingbird don't sing
Daddy's gonna buy you a diamond ring
If that diamond ring don't shine
Surely gonna break this heart of mine
For that mock, mockingbird
Mockingbird
For that mock
Mockingbird
Mockingbird
Mockingbird
Ooh
Mockingbird
And when that mockingbird took wing
It flew into most everything
It broke the lamp, the vase, the clock
When mom finds out she's gonna be in shock
I guess I should have locked him in
I should have bought a cage for him
For that mockingbird
Mockingbird
For that mock
Mockingbird
Mockingbird
Mockingbird
Ooh
Mockingbird
Mockingbird
In my heart
Hush little baby don't say a word
I'm pretty sure mom hasn't heard
We'll clean the rug we'll sweep the floor
We'll shoo that bird right through the door
When mom comes in we'll act like nerds
And blame it on that mockingbird
On that mock mockingbird
Mockingbird, I'm a mock, mockingbird, mockingbird
Ooh, mockingbird, ooh, mockingbird, yeah, yeah
Mockingbird
Mockingbird
Mockingbird
