Sleep my child and peace attend thee all through the night
God in angels, God will send thee
All through the night
Soft and drowsy hours are creeping
Hill and dale in slumber sleeping
I, my loving vigil keeping
All through the night
Sleep my child and peace attend thee all through the night
In my arms my warmth I'll give thee
All through the night
Watch the moon, the shadows dancing
Ponies on the wall up rancing
Wishing these sweet dreams long lasting
All through the night
All through the night
All through the night
