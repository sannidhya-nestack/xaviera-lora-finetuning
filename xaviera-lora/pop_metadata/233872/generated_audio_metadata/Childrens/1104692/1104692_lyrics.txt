I am a motorboat, splashing through the waves
Zooming through the water, just how a boat behaves
I'm just a little boat, one day when I get big
I'll carry lots of people with a captain on my bridge
I'm just a little boat, but you might be surprised
I'll make some mighty waves right before your eyes
I'll give you a tip
You know it won't be long
I'll grow into a great big ship who's really really strong
I am a motorboat in black and gold and green
I am the fastest boat that you have ever seen
I'll zoom around the islands then drop you at the shore
Though you're waving me goodbye, you'll soon be back for more
I'm just a little boat, but you might be surprised
I'll make some mighty waves right before your eyes
I'll give you a tip, you know it won't be long
I'll grow into a great big ship who's really really strong
I've got lots of life belts and I love to play
There's room for lots of children, we'll soon be on our way
We'll whiz out to the lighthouse, then over to the pier
If you live by the water, I could see your house from here
I'm just a little boat, but you might be surprised
I'll make some mighty waves right before your eyes
I'll give you a tip
You know it won't be long
I'll grow into a great big ship who's really really strong
I am a motor boat
Splashing through the waves
Zooming through the water
Just how a boat behaves
I'm just a little boat
One day when I get big
I'll carry lots of people with a captain on my bridge
I'll carry lots of people with a captain on my bridge
I'll carry lots of people with a captain on my bridge
