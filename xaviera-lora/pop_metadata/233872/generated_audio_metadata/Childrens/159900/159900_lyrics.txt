Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo-oo-oo-oo, pop, pop, pop
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo-oo-oo-oo, pop pop pop
Willie was a six year old boy on the block
He was a beepin' and a poppin' since he learned to walk
He liked to do what every other young boy does
And he thought that that was all there was
Then Willie met the drums and when he gets the beat
Up and down the street you'd hear the tapping of feet
when a boy meets the drums and he starts to play
You can hear the neighborhood say
You go, go!
And he played those drums'til the neighborhood girls and boys were singing "Dig that noise"
He played those drums'til all the neighborhood girls and boys were singing "Take it to the maximum"
Willie said his mama, "Will you ever stop? You know that, Mama, when you bop, you gotta bop ten drops"
So little Willie keeps drummin' day in and day out
You can hear the whole neighborhood shout, "You go, go !"
He played those drums till the neighborhood girls and boys were singing "Dig That Noise"
Played those drums till the neighborhood girls and boys were saying "Take it to the maximum"
Willie grew old but he never did stop because you know that when you pop you gotta pop'til you drop
My little Willie keeps drumming'cause he always will
The neighbors they be shouting it still "You go go !"
You the man!
Do do do do do do do do do do do do
