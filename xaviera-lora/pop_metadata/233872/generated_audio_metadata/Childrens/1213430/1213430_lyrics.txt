Come sail your ship and take a trip on the big blue briny waves
And for your pleasure, but at your leisure, search for the treasure caves
Near Staghorn Crag you shall fly your flag, so we'll see the skull and crossbones
Here you'll hear the moans and groans from the locker of Davy Jones
From the locker of Davy Jones
All aboard!
All aboard for the pirate ships in hover! All aboard! All aboard! She's a sailin' condor! All aboard! All aboard! For the pirate ships in hover! She'll sail away through skies of grey with a pirate's cutlass drawl! With a pirate's cutlass drawl!
Now without fail take down your sail and keep your boat afloat
But don't take flight until the night and you spike up and blithe the cutthroat
He'll give you a sign as a stroke of nine to smuggle your wine ashore
And if a ghost guard's there don't despair
be a pirate in disguise for sure
be a pirate in disguise for sure (all aboard)
All aboard for the pirate ships in hover
All aboard, all aboard
She's a sailin' down the door
All aboard, all aboard
For the pirate ships in hover
She'll sail away through skies of grey
With a pirate's cutlass claw
With a pirate's cutlass claw
Captain Blackbird's indeed too swigging rum or at least some other kind of drink
And if you walk the plank use a self-toothed thank you's no pity for those who sink
But we'll still go forth, head toward the north and plunder what comes by
we're the crew who never rue and never wonder why
No never wonder why all aboard
All aboard for the pirate ships in hover
All aboard, all aboard, she's a sailin' come the dawn
All aboard, all aboard for the pirate ships in hover
She'll sail away through skies of grey with a pirate's compass strong
With a pirate's compass strong
