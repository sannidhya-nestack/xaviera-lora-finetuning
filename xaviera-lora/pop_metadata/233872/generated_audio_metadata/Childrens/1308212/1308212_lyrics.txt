Oh, in a land of stomps and roars, T-Rex leads the conga line
Colored lights bounce off the floors, everyone is feeling fine
We sway to tribal rhythms, thumping like the ancient past
Groove and hit the dinosaurs, this party's built to last
Let's groove, let's groove on the cretaceous floor
Bounce to the beat, gotta move some more
Vinyl feet stomping all night strong
Feel the rhythm where we all belong
Triceratops twirls around, velociraptors hum along
Pterodactyls wings astound, chiming in with a joyful song
Rex raps in funky measures
The cave's alive tonight
The disco ball illuminates
Shining bold and bright
Brontosaurus bops in time
Grooving with a gentle grace
We jump, we spin so electrified
In this Jurassic place
Every scale and claw unites
Fueling our cosmic vibe
In this wild prehistoric jam
We find a world so alive
Whoa, whoa, let your dino heart run free
Whoa, feel that mighty energy together we roar, unstoppable force
Dinosaur disco, that's our course
Dinosaur disco in your mind
Blazing forward and unconfined
The roars and rhythms never go
Take that groove wherever you go
Dinosaur, just so loud and clear
It's still stomping on when we disappear
Triteratops twirls around, velociraptors hum along
Pterodactyl's wings astound, chiming in with a joyful song
Rex raps in funky measures, the cave's alive tonight
The disco ball illuminates, shining bold and bright
Brontosaurus bops in time
Groovin' with a gentle grace
We jump, we spin so electrified
In this Jurassic place
Every scale and claw unites
Fuelin' our cosmic vibe
In this wild prehistoric jam
We find a world so alive
Woah, let your dino heart run free
Woah, we feel that mighty energy together we roar
Unstoppable force, force
Dinosaur disco that's our course
Dinosaur disco in your mind
Blazing forward and unconfined
The roars and rhythms never go
Take that groove wherever you go
Dinosaur disco loud and clear
Still stomping on when we disappear
