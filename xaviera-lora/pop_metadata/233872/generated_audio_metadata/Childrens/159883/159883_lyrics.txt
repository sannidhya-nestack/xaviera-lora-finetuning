He's cunning as a card trick
He's bold as a bear
He's happy as a half-brek
Whose hats are all there
He's busy as a ball game
He's tricky as a toy
He's fast as a fire truck
He's my little boy
She's warm as a wigwam
She's calm as a cloud
She's friendly as a foghorn
Sometimes she gets loud
She's nice as a night light
And cute as a curve
She's kind as a kyte tail
She's my little girl
They're sweet as a swing set, they're solid as stones
Delirious as dogs who just found fifteen bones
They're happy as a handshake, my children, my two
Come let me tell you how much I love you, ooh, I love you
