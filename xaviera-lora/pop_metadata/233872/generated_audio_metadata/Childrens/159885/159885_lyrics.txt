A tinker, a tailor, a soldier, a sailor
A tinker, a tailor, a soldier, sailor
A tinker or a tailor
You will be what you will be
Oh but darling just remember
You can always come to me
A tinker, a tailor, a soldier, a sailor
A tinker, a tailor, a soldier, sailor darling
When you are older
What you will do
Oh but one day
You can be sure of
I will always love you
And when someday
When you are far from here
And troubled in your sleep
Just call on me
I will be there for you
That's a promise I will keep
A thinker, a tailor, a soldier, a sailor
A thinker, a tailor, a soldier, sailor
A soldier, maybe a sailor
What you will be
Oh, darling, wherever you go
You can count on me, nothing could be better
A tailor, a soldier, a sailor, a tinker, a tailor, a soldier, a sailor, a tinker, a tailor, a soldier, a sailor
A tinker, a tailor, a soldier, a sailor, a tinker, a tailor, a soldier, a sailor, a tinker
