In a cozy corner with teddy friends around
We pour pretend tea, a soft and playful sound
Cups in a circle, treats made of air
Smiles so bright we have joy to spare
Teddy bear tea party, oh what fun we share
Teddy bear tea party, giggles fill the air
Teddy bear tea party, there's love everywhere
Sipping from our tea cups without a care
We clink our tiny cups, gently making a toast
Imagining flavors the best we can boast
Teddy bows politely, we pass, we delight
Every sip brings wonder in our snug invite
Hold these moments near
Safe in little hearts
When we share our laughter
Magic never parts
Teddy bear tea party, oh what fun we share
Teddy bear tea party, giggles fill the air
Teddy bear tea party, there's love everywhere
Sipping from our tea cups without a care
Teddy bear tea party
Treasured from the start
In this joyful gathering
We'd play with all our heart plain
Little toy train
Oh little toy train
Bringing happy smiles again and again
Hmm
Teddy bear tea party, oh what fun we share
Teddy bear tea party, giggles fill the air
