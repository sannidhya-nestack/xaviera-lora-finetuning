Thank the Lord, thank the Lord for this large rock
We can all go ashore without getting wet socks
We set our sights on America
It's a miracle we made it this far
We brave the cold, the wind and rain
And England is from where we came
Now there's only one thing left to do
To give credit where credit is due
Thank the Lord, thank the Lord for this large rock
We can all go ashore without getting wet socks
Thank the Lord, thank the Lord for this large rock
We can all go ashore without getting wet socks
We can all go ashore without getting wet socks
Now there's only one thing left to do
To give credit where credit is due
Thank the Lord, thank the Lord for this large rock
We can all go ashore without getting wet socks
Thank the Lord, thank the Lord for this large rock
We can all go ashore without getting wet socks
We can all go ashore without getting wet socks
