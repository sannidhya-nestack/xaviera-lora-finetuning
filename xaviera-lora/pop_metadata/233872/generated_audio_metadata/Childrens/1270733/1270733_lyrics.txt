Madame Crap, Madame Crap, teach me how to dance like that
Madame Crap, Madame Crap, teach me how to dance like that
I'm in awe, yes it's true, wish that I could dance like you
If I could dance like that, I would show my mom and dad
Teach me how, Madam Crab, please
Madam Crab, Madam Crab, teach me how to dance like that
Madam Crab, Madam Crab, teach me how to dance like that
Madam Crab
Madam Crab, you're so cool, maybe you should start a school
When the school day is through, we'll be dancing just like you
I'll be tops in your class,'cause I'll learn your moves so fast
I can just see it now, madam if you teach me how
Folks will come from miles around, France
Madam Crabbe, madam Crabbe, teach me how to dance like that
Madame Crab, Madame Crab, teach me how to dance like that
Madame Crab, Madame Crab
