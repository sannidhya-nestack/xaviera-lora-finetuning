I went to the animal fair
The birds and the bees were there
The big baboon by the light of the moon
Was combing his auburn hair
The monkey fell out of his bunk
And slid down the elephant's trunk
The elephant sneezed and fell on his knees
And whoop he came of the monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey
I went to the animal fair
The birds and the bees were there
The big baboon by the light of the moon
Was combing his auburn hair
The monkey fell out of his bunk
And slid down the elephant's trunk
The elephant sneezed and fell on his knees
And what became of the monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey
I went to the animal fair
The birds and the bees were there
The big baboon by the light of the moon
Was combing his auburn hair
The monkey fell out of his bunk
And slid down the elephant's trunk
The elephant sneezed and fell on his knees
And whoop he came of the monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey
I went to the animal fair
The birds and the bees were there
The big baboon by the light of the moon
Was combing his auburn hair
The monkey fell out of his bunk
And slid down the elephant's trunk
The elephant sneezed and fell on his knees
And what became of the monkey?
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey
