Goosey goosey gander, whither shall I wander
Upstairs and downstairs and in my lady's chamber
There I met an old man, would not say his prayers
I took him by the left leg and threw him down the stairs
Goosey goosey gander, whither shall I wander?
Upstairs and downstairs and in my lady's chamber
There I met an old man who would not say his prayers
I took him by the left leg and threw him down the stairs
