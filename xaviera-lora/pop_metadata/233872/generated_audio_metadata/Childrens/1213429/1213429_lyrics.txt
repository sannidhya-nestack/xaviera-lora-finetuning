When the boatswain's caught a-napping and the sails they are a-flapping
And our boat be drifting off and off away
We call for our captain loudly and salute him oh so proudly
When once again he goes and saves the day (saves the day)
Brave is he
Golden Everdaring brings us all along to enjoy the lovely view
We know what it's like when he wants to go a-roving
He's leader of us all, you know, and we're his mockly crew
And we're his mockly crew
When the ship runs out of rum and we're feeling mighty glum
There'll be naught so fraught till we dock into port
Yet'tis our only duty to but skirmish for our booty
Then we sail away before we air get caught (air get caught)
Brave is he, bold and ever daring
Brings us all along to enjoy the lovely view
We know what it's like when he wants to go a-roving
He's the hero, a song he'll do and with his mockly crew
And with his mockly crew
When there ain't so much as a carrot
We're as sick as a pirate's parrot
We're so hungry that we don't know what to do
We're at risk of getting scurvy
But our captain thinks us worthy
he boils his socks and makes a tasty stew
Tasty stew, brave is he
Bold and ever daring
Brings us all along
To enjoy the lovely view
We know what it's like
When he wants to go a-roving
He's the erotic song, you know
And we is hotly crewed
And we is hotly crewed
If we falls into the drink and before we starts to sink
He might spy a shiver of sharks come swimming by
And our captain dives right in with his cutlass knee this chin
To the rescue before he even starts to think (starts to think)
Brave is he, bold and ever daring
Brings his soul along to enjoy the lovely view
We know what it's like when he wants to go a-rolling
He's here around us all you know and we're his mucky crew
His mucky, mucky crew
