Well my daddy likes to eat that spicy food
And the way he shoves it down it sure looks real good
The way he shoves it down
He pours that hot sauce on
And eats till it's all gone
He says don't take a bite but I think I could
And I said, "Hi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi"
I ate Dad's hot sauce
And I drank tons of water, but it doesn't seem enough
And I said, "Hi-yi-yii-yi-yi-yi-yi"
I ate Dad's hot sauce
Who knew (who knew) that a burning mouth (it's so hot) could be so rough
Now my teeth are clenched
My eyes are filling with tears
And there's this awful ringing in my ears
(Ringing in my ears)
My forehead's filled with sweat
And I haven't breathed just yet
I'm worried my breath will burn anything here
And I said, "Hi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi, I eat Dad's hot sauce"
And I drank tons of water, but it doesn't seem enough
And I said, "Hi-yi-yi, yi-yi-yi-yi-yi, I ate Dad's hot sauce"
Who knew (who knew?) (that's me)
A burning mouth (it's so hot) could be so rough?
Well, my buddy, he's asking me, "Is anything wrong?"
(Is there anything wrong?)
And I remember the tricks he played on me all along
(Oh, what a nasty thing to do)
So I shake my sore head no, and give him a hot taco
And listen,'cause soon he'll be singing this very same song
And he'll say, "Hi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi
I eat Dad's hot sauce"
And I drank tons of water
But it doesn't seem enough
And he'll say, "Hi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi
I eat Dad's hot sauce"
Who knew (who knew) (that's me)
A burning mouth (it's so hot to me) could be so rough
Who knew a burning mouth could be so rough
