Hey kids, can you turn on your imaginations for just a minute? What if there really were little aliens that flew around in outer space? Do you think they would have fun zooming by the planets in their spaceship? Do you think they would be friendly? Do you think they could talk? My friend, Theodore Noring, heard some aliens say "Widgey Wodgey." What do you think that means?
There's four little aliens flying all around
Zipping through the universe, never can be found
They're soaring through the Milky Way, roaring past the sun
Those four little aliens are always on the run
Zooming all around, the spaceship seems to hop
the aliens are dancing the galactic hop-bop
Woojibaji, woojibaji, woojibaji, woojibaji, woojibiji, woojibiji
A-bop-bop-di-bop-bop-di-bap-di-bap-bop
They're spinning round Saturn, sliding down its rings
They're blowing through Neptune, it's fun to have a fling
Dodging round asteroids, it's one exciting strip
Now buzzing in outer space, a real thrilling trip
Catch a playin' with the planets
Bumpin' off the moon
Streakin' through the stars
Stingin' this whole tune
Boogy-wogy, boogy-wogy, boogy-wogy
Boogy-wogy, boogy-wogy, boogy-wogy
A-bop-bop-de-bop-bop-de-bop-de-bop-bop
There's Tweezer, he's skinny, loves to goof around
There's Beezer, he's funny, likes dancing up and down
There's Snooze, he's sleepy, always wants a nap
There's Lop, he's the pilot, real good with a map
Those four little aliens having lots of fun (Wah wah)
They're bumping through outer space, jive high when day is done
Woojoo wajoo, woojoo wajoo
Woo-jee-wa-jee, woo-jee-wa-jee
Woo-jee-wa-jee, woo-jee-wa-jee
A bop, bop, dee-bop, bop, dee-bop, dee-bop, bop
Woo-jee-wa-jee, woo-jee-wa-jee
Woo-jee-wa-jee, woo-jee-wa-jee
Woo-jee-wa-jee, woo-jee-wa-jee
A bop, bop, dee-bop, bop, dee-bop, dee-bop, bop
Yeah
