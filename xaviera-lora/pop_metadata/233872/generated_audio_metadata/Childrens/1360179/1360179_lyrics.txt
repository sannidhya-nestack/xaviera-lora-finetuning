Oh I, I try to put my's on fast
That foot first then the right at last
But oops my toe is stuck what do I do?
I, wait though I squiggle and I call out to
If I won't find your water shoe
I try again tap tap on the floor
Maybe if I twist maybe a little more
Stuck in my shoes
What a silly way to start the day
Stuck in my shoes
Where my foot come out and play
Shake it, move it, everyone can try
We all get a little bit sometimes
I ask my friends, can you lend a hand?
They hop and giggle, join my silly band
We sing and dance, we laugh and spin
Even when I'm stuck, fun always wins
Let's make a shoe parade, hooray hooray!
Left, right, stomp and shuffle
Wiggle, jiggle, quicker, fuffle
Stuck in my shoes
What a silly little scene, let's party
Stuck in my shoe, love will come out and play
Shake it, move it, everyone can try
We all get a little stuck sometimes
Oh-oh-oh
Your jacket zips low
If your backpack's hard to throw
If your hat's all crooked and that's okay
We're all learning every day
Stuck in my shoes
What a silly way to start the day
Stuck in my shoes (shoes)
Will my foot come out and play (come out and play)
Shake it, move it, everyone can try
We all get a little stuck sometimes
Stuck in my shoes, that's okay
We'll get moving anyway
