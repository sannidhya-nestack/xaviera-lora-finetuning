All you children, you gather around me, now you come over here, you listen to this
Oh yes
There's a story I want to tell you
Itsy bitsy spider
Be climbing so high, so high, so high
Oh yes
Gather round children, get a little closer to me, listen to my story
You'll be singing along with me very soon
The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Up come the sun and dried up all of the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider climbed up the spout again
Itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout
Down come the rain and washed the spider out
Up come the sun and dried up all of the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider climbed up the spout again
The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Up come the sun and dried up all the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider climbed up the spout again
Itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout
Down come the rain and washed the spider out
Up come the sun
And dried up all of the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider
Climbed up the spout again
Now you children, you show me how to be a spider
