Tomatoes, can you see them grow?
Shooting up fast from the seeds we sow
Tomatoes, everyone should know
There's so many meals in which they go
Well I'll tell you something that I know is true
That the first tomatoes came from Peru
But now they grow in lots of places
And where it's colder they grow in greenhouses
The biggest tomato fight in the world
Takes part each year in a tank or bunno
And the heaviest tomato that ever grew
Was the size of a baby kangaroo
Tomatoes, can you see them grow?
Shooting up fast from the seeds we sow
Tomatoes, everyone should know
There's so many meals in which they go
Tomatoes are tasty and I'll tell you a fact
They are good for our hearts, help keep us intact
And something I thought was the strangest of all
Is that they're classed as a fruit, not a vegetable (vegetable)
Tomatoes, tomatoes
Can you see them grow?
Ooh, tomatoes
Can you see them grow?
