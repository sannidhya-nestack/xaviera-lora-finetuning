Oh, this starry night I'm floating'bove my bed like a feather, like a feather
Oh, this starry night I'm floating'bove my bed like a feather, like a feather
Through my window I see the fireflies in the grass
Through my window I hear the china bird on the hill
Through my window I see the dog asleep in the hay
Through my window I hear you singing out from the house
And oh, this starry night I'm floating'bout my bed like a feather, like a feather
Oh, this starry night I'm floating'bout my bed like a feather, like a feather
Through my window I see a sister watching the moon
Through my window I hear a church bell ringing the time
Through my window I see shadows dance on the house
Through my window I hear mama's sweet lullaby
And oh, this starry night I'm floating'bout my bed like feathers, like feathers
Oh, this starry night I'm floating'bout bed like feathers, like feathers
Oh, this starry night I'm floating by my bed like feathers, like feathers
Oh, this starry night I'm floating by bed like feathers, like feathers, like feathers
