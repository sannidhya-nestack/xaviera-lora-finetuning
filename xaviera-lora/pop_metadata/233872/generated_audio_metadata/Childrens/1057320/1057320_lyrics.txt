Hey Mark, what's for tea?
If you're cooking roast potatoes I'll have two or three
Each day on our planet you know that
A billion different people will eat potato
Uh-huh
Mashed, boiled, roasted or fried
There's so many ways to cook'em, which ones have you tried?
Sometimes we call them a pod
They can grow in lots of places straight out of the mud
Everybody like check check
Everybody like mash mash
Everybody like roast yeah
Everybody like check check
Everybody like mash mash
Everybody like roast
Everybody like check check
Everybody like roast
Let's go, a carb, light, pasta or rice
They give you energy and it tastes so nice
Chips are yummy it's true
But if you have too many they're not healthy for you
In'95 something strange took place
They took a potato and they grew it in space
To reach this kind of fame
The potato must be king of the vegetable game
Everybody like checks, everybody like mash
Everybody like roast, everybody like checks
Everybody like mash, everybody like roast
Everybody like checks, everybody like roast
