I went outside without a hat
But I'm not sick because of that
I'm half dead
Cause mama's mad they making chicken soup
If you had the table space
You could stop the human race
All it takes is just one taste of homemade chicken soup
We were sliding in the snow
Then I couldn't feel my toes
And now all day I blow my nose and eat more chicken soup
Rabbits huddle in their hole
But I'm lucky I am told
To try and eat another bowl of yummy chicken soup
From now on I'll wear my hat, scarf and boots and all of that
If only I could feed the cat my bowl of chicken soup
We were sliding in the snow
Then I couldn't feel my toes
Now all day I blow my nose
And eat more chicken soup
Rabbits huddle in the hold
But I'm lucky, I am told
To try and eat another bowl
Of yummy chicken soup
From now on I'll wear my hat
Scarf and boots and all of that
If only I could feed the cat my bowl of chicken soup
