I walk into the room
I see you waving, dancing, tossing hair
I want to know, I want to see
What's hiding, hiding, what could it be?
Is it fuzzy? Is it flat? Is it stripey?
Is it spotted? Is it white or is it skinny?
I keep wondering and so many things
What's under your hat? What's under your hat?
Tell me, tell me, please explain that
What's under your hat? (ha ha ha ha)
What's under your hat?
Could you show me? Could you show me?
I giggle and guess twirl around
Maybe it's squishy, maybe it makes a sound
I jump in place, I clap my hands
I want to imagine, I want to understand
Is it chewy? Is it sweet?
Can it wiggle? Can it leap?
Is it colorful? Is it neat?
So many things that I'd love to meet
What's under your hat? What's under your hat?
Tell me, tell me, please explain that
What's under your hat?
Would you show me? Could you show me?
Maybe it's something silly
Maybe it's something small
Maybe it's a tiny critter
Or maybe nothing at all
Let me guess, let me see
Will you laugh and play with me?
What's under your hat today?
What's under your hat today? (woof, woof, woof)
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
