Your dreams wait for you as you lay down in bed
Resting your body, you're resting your head
Magical places where wishes come true
Let yourself drift far away
Your dreams wait for you
Your dreams wait for you as you fall into sleep
Float down the stream as you slumber so deep
You'll soon reach the castle, it's almost in view
Pass through the gates and you're there
Your dreams wait for you
Tell the king all you've hoped for
Tell the queen why you're there
Your dreams wait for you as you start to awake
Night turns to day as the dawn starts to break
As you arise to a morning that's new
As long as you live every day
Your dreams wait for you
Your dreams wait for you
Your dreams wait for you
