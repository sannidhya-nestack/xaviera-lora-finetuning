We line up in the backyard, gears all set to spin
Metal elbows clicking, bright lights flashing thin
Wheels roll on the grass, and circuits start to hum
This wacky clanky showdown has finally begun
Funky Robot Race
Beep beep on the go
Zipping through the mayhem with a techno glow
Funky robot race watch those pivots flow
Bolt by bolt we'll carry on the show
We swerve around the sprinkler in a zig zag style
Slipping on the puddles but laughing all the while
Arms flailing, beeps wailing, never miss a beat
Our silly metal shuffle puts magic on repeat
Hold that silly spark inside, keep your circuits bright
When the race is over, we'll still beam with delight
Funky robot lace, beep beep on the go
Zipping through the mayhem with the techno glow
Spunky Robot Race, watch those pivots flow
Bolt by bolt, we'll carry on the show
The finish line is nearing
Fans cheer from the side
We rev up extra power
Hearts brimming with pride
Sparks fly at the tape
With a final whirring roar
Our friendship soars higher than it ever did before
Zipping through the mayhem with a techno glow
Funky robot race, watch those pivots blow
Bolt by bolt we'll carry on the show
Funky robot race
Our circuits won't et
In every spark of fun
We're the best roads yet
