Miss Molly had a dolly who was sick, sick, sick
So she called for the doctor to come quick, quick, quick
The doctor came with a bag and a hat
And knocked on the door with a rat-a-tat-tat
She looked at the dolly and she shook her head
And she said, "Miss Molly, put her straight to bed"
She wrote on the paper for a pill, pill, pill
I'll be back in the morning with the bill, bill, bill
