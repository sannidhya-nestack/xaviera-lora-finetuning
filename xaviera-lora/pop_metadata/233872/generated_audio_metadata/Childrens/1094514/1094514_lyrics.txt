Mommy, can't I hear a story?
Won't you tuck me in tonight?
Stories make it easier when you turn on the light
Once upon a time there was a little bear
He had two older sisters who curled his hair
Mommy please another story
Before you tuck me in tonight
Stories make it easier
When you turn out the light
The bear with his new hair
Climbed up the tallest tree
He took a look around him
And saw a monkey mommy
Please another story
Before you tuck me in tonight
Stories make it easier
When you turn out the light
The bear and his new friend
They swung from tree to tree
And when they found a beehive
They ate some honey
Mommy, thank you for the stories
I'll have pleasant dreams tonight
Stories make it easier when you turn out the light
Stories make it easier when you turn out the light
