Out in the deep ocean many sharks you will find
Some of them are nasty and some of them are kind
There are big ones and small ones and blue ones and grey
As long as it's just fish on their menu today
Look out for sharks in the big toothy sharks in the
Hungry great sharks in the sea
The scariest, the mightiest big shark who may bite
Is undoubtedly the one that they call the great white
Look out for the fin that sticks up in the air
And don't dare go swimming nearby for a swim
Great white sharks, great white sharks
They are so very real
Always looking out for a quick easy meal
Great white sharks, great white sharks
They'll scare you to death
Or if not they might kill you with a fishy bad breath
Look out for the sharks in the
Big toothy sharks in the
Hungry great sharks in the sea
