Shoo, shoo, my papa, shoo, shoo
The dog woke up from his nap and he said
I don't wanna chase a cat today
And he stretched the little sugar's head and he said
I don't wanna chase a cat today
I don't know why I ever chased that cat
I must've been nuts acting crazy like that
Today I'm gonna put on a different hat
I'm not gonna chase a cat today (I'm not gonna chase a cat today)
Shoo shoo
Pup pup pup
Shoo shoo
Well the cat said now that you mention it
I don't wanna chase a mouse today
I'm tired of the running and the scratching
I don't wanna chase a mouse today
In fact I never really liked chasing mice
I frankly never thought it was all that nice
Today I'm gonna let'em run past me twice
I'm not gonna chase a mouse today
Now the mouse when he heard what was going on said I don't want to chase a lady today
And he liked it, and he liked the idea
I don't want to chase a lady today (I don't want to chase a lady today)
I hate to see her running around the place
Jumping on chairs getting red in the face
I think I'll stop following the human race
And I'm not gonna chase a lady today (I'm not gonna chase a lady today)
The lady whooped when she heard the good news
She powdered and popped and put on her new shoes
She said, "Let's have a party today, shoop"
She said, "Let's have a party today shoop"
Now please shake hands for goodness sake or let's shake
Pause or whatever you shake
And we'll bring down some juice and cut up some cakes
Because nobody's chasing nobody
Nobody's chasing nobody
Nobody's chasing nobody
Nobody's chasing nobody today
Everybody think she's a chick
Oh, I love a party (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo) (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo) (shoo, shoo) (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo) (shoo) (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo) (shoo) (shoo) (shoo) (shoo) (shoo) (shoo) (shoo) (shoo) (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo) (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo) (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo) (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo) (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo) (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo) (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo) (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo) (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo) (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo) (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo) (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo) (shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo)
