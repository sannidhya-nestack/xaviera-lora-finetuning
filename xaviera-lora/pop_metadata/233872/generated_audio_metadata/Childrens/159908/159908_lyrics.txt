And on the sunny side of your street
There's a house I see
The door is open big and wide
Looks like a smile to me
No matter what kind of day you're having
No matter what kind of trouble you're in
Come into this happy house
You will discover the grin within
when you come into this happy house
Goodness takes your hat
Laughter takes you by the hair
Says that my friend is that
Now come into the kitchen meet the top banana be a couch potato get a piece of the pie
Do the cakewalk mashed potatoes peppermint twist because everybody's swinging
You'll wanna know why
Come into this happy house goodness takes your hand
Laughter takes you by the hand and that my friend is bad
There's a piano in the parlor
You can tickle the ivories
If the walls get taller they would surely sing
You can turn the tables
You can cut a rug
See the light hit the ceiling
Hear the raptors ring
Come into this happy house
Goodness takes your hat
Laughter takes you by the hand
And that my friend is that
Nora's in the house (yes ma'am)
Anna's in the house (yes ma'am)
James is in the house (yes ma'am)
Brianna's in the house (yes ma'am)
Katie's in the house (uh-huh)
Willie's in the house (uh-huh)
Lizzie's in the house (uh-huh)
G e is in the house (oh yeah)
Everyone who's anyone and everybody's cousin
Is in this house, this happy house
So come on stay awhile
Knock your socks off
Gotta be in your bonnet
Put on a different hat
And you can lose your shirt
Or you can keep your shirt on
You can dress to the nines
Or dress like that
Come into this happy house
Goodness takes your hand
Laughter takes you by the hand
And that my friend is that
Cause when you come into this happy house
Goodness takes your hand
Lefty takes you by the hands and that my friend is that
