I'm just a little girl, I'm just a little girl
A wise old owl lived in an oak
The more that he saw, the less that he spoke
The less that he spoke, the more that he heard
Why aren't we all like that wise old bird?
A wise old owl lived in an oak
The more that he saw, the less that he spoke
The less that he spoke, the more that he heard
Why aren't we all like that wise old bird
A wise old owl, lived in an oak
The more that he saw, the less that he spoke
The less that he spoke, the more that he heard
Why aren't we all like that, wise old bird
A wise old owl lived in an oak
The more that he saw, the less that he spoke
The less that he spoke, the more that he heard
Why aren't we all like that wise old bird
