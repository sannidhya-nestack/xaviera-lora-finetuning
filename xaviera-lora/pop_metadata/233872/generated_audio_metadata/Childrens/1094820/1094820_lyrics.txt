Temperature is three degrees
And isn't gonna budge
Mama's in the kitchen
Making February fudge
Half a dollar snowflakes
I've fallen fast and hard
The lump out in the driveway
Used to be the family car
The radio is playing
Our number one hit song
No school, all school Portland, Maine
And ninety miles beyond
And the news is spread like wildfire
Through the house from kid to kid
They call off school today
Yes they did
They did
It's the kind of day you dream about
December straight through March
Mom is in the kitchen
Making February fudge
It's the kind of day you dream about
December straight through March
Mamas in the kitchen making February fudge
