Have you ever done a polka before?
It's lots of fun and pretty easy
Follow me and let's polka together
Happy children let's hold hands
Make a circle big and grand
Go round and round and round and round
It's the preschool polka
Skip your tiny little feet
To the bouncy polka beat
First go left
Then go right
Smiling faces, what a sight
Happy children, let's hold hands
Make a circle big and grand
Go round and round and round and round
It's the preschool polka
Now let's go the other way
Slide your feet and then I'll say
Hip hip hip
Hip hooray
Make them hear you far away
Happy children let's hold hands
Make a circle big and grand
Go round and round and round and round
It's the preschool polka
Come on kids follow me
Step in the middle reach up high
You pretend to touch the sky
Clap your hands
One two three
Step back out now follow me
Happy children let's hold hands
Make a circle big and grand
Go round and round and round and round
It's the preschool polka
Happy children let's hold hands
Make a circle big and grand
Go round and round and round and round
It's the preschool polka
It's the preschool polka
