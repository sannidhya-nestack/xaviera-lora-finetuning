We gather in the living room ready for the play
Slip on silly socks to chase our cares away
Faces made of buttons that wiggle with each grin
This zany puppet party is set to begin
Silly sock puppet show illusions come alive
Every silly joke helps our laughter thrive
Silly sock puppet show, bright voices everywhere
Join our puppet story full of wacky flare
We shuffle hands together
Each friend takes a part
A zebra stripe or polka dot
Can spark a brand new start
Colorful creations
Bring giggles in a row
In sock-tastic mischief
Watch the magic flow
Hold to this moment
Let imaginations grow
Sock by sock we find the fun that only we can
Silly sock puppet show, illusions come alive
Every silly joke helps our laughter thrive
Silly sock puppet show, bright voices everywhere
Join our puppet story full of wacky flair
Puppet show, we'll do it all again
Playful socks and smiling hearts, our show will never end
Silly sock, puppet show, we'll do it all again
With playful socks and smiling hearts, our show will never end, end
