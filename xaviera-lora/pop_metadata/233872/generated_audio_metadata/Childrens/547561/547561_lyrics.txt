The long day is over
The moonlight is glowing
The birds are sleeping
The night wind is singing
The world turns easy
The children are sleeping
And mom and dad are talking
And the old dog is barking
Children are praying
That sweet dreams are waiting
As mother kisses them goodnight
As daddy's turning out the lights
The night grows quiet
The house is silent
The stars shine softly
And the night wind is calling
