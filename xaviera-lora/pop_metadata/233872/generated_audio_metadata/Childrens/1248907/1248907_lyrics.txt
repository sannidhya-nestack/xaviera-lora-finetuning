Gather around, my shipmates heed the call
I'll teach you the ways of the way of claw
Through shadows removed, silent as the breeze
Rise daylight sailors, masters of the sea
The way of claw, the ancient might
Fluffy warriors in the moonlight
The way of claw, the claw so sharp
Cats on the ship go unseen
To hide you must be patient
To strike you must be swift
From crows nest to the hull
We roam forever free
Masters of the ship
This is our legacy
The way of war
The ancient might
Fluffy warriors
In the moonlit night
We are core
With claws so sharp
Cats on the ship go unseen
To hunt you must be patient
To strike you must be swift
From crow's nest to the hold
We roam forever free
Masters of the ship
This is our legacy
The way of core
The ancient might
Clumsy warriors
In the moonlight night
The way of core
With claws so sharp
Cats on the ship
Go on a sting
A cat strategy, the subtlety's clear
Walk in silence, no need to show fear
Know yourself and know your prey
In a hundred battles, your path will stay
He slipped as the wind in your attack
Elusive as shadows, never look back
In every pause strike, precision found
Victory in silence without a sound
Away aboard the ancient might
Fluffy warriors in the moonlight night
Away aboard with castles sharp
Cats on the ship go unseen
