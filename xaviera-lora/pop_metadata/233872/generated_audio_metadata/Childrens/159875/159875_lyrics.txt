Run and chase the brown dog, he really doesn't mind
If it were raining cats and dogs, he might be hard to find
Ding dong, ding dong dog
Run and chase the brown dog, he isn't what he seems
See him in the park today, you'll see him in your dreams
Ding
Ding dong, ding dong dog
Run and chase the brown dog
You know he likes to run
When it's raining cats and dogs
The dogs have all the fun
Ding dong, ding dong dog
Run and chase the brown dog
And teach him how to sing
He could learn this silly song
And sing it for the king
Singing ding dong, ding dong dog
Ding dong, ding dong
Run and chase the brown dog, he really doesn't mind
If there's a raining cats and dogs, he might be hiding fine
Run and chase the brown dog, he really doesn' mind
If there's a raining cats and dogs, he really doesn't mind
Run and chase the brown dog, he really doesn "t mind
If there's a raining cats and dogs, he might be hiding fine
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong dog
What a taste of brown dog, he really doesn't mind
If it were random cats and dogs, he might be hard to find
