Sun up, sun down, another day as the world turns round
Sun up, sun down, the moon lifts up as the sun goes down
The sun peaks up and lights the sky, the clouds are slowly floating by
The sun goes down and the moon appears, the stars are tiny blinking big
The sun peaks up and lights the sky
The clouds are slowly as the water turns white
The sun goes down and the moon appears
The stars are up as the sun goes down
When tomorrow becomes today
Today becomes a yesterday
It's confusing you might say
But it's the start of another day
Sun up, sun down, another day as the world turns round
Sun up, sun down, the moon lifts up as the sun goes down
Sun peeks up and lights the sky, the clouds are slowly floating by
The sun goes down and the moon appears, the stars are tiny blinking here
The sun peaks up and lights the sky
The clouds are slow as the world turns by
The sun goes down and the moon appears
The stars are set as the sun goes down
Twenty-four hours in a day
For some you sleep, some you play
One week has just seven days
It starts Monday and ends Sunday
Sun up, sun down, another day as the world turns round
Sun up, sun down, the moon lifts up as the sun goes down
The sun peaks up and lights the sky, the clouds are slowly floating by
The sun goes down and the moon appears, the stars are tiny blinking me
Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Sunday, Thursday, Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday, Thursday, Sunday, Thursday, Sunday, Thursday
Monday comes by as the sun goes down
Sun up
Sun down
Son of a...
