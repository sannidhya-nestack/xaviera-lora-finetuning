A mother loves her family
And so it should always be
I pine for my poor missing daughters
But can't join the rescued sea
Sing for the ones you love
Sing and let it be known
Keep'em close to your heart
Then you'll never be apart
And they'll all come safely home
I pray to prevent all my fears
The crew be the bravest of souls
I'll wipe away all of my tears
And hope that no doomsday bell tolls
So sing for the ones you love
Sing and let it be known
The time is right to et the fight
And they'll all come safely home
