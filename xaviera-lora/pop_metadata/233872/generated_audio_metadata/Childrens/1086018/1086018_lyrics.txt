It's no crime to be so shy
Why make fun when I hide
Shouldn't matter if I'm quiet inside
Jeepers, creepers, seepers, can we all be friends?
I said jeepers, creepers, seepers, can we all be friends?
Why can't we all? Why can't we all? Why can't we all be friends?
Why can't we all, why can't we all, why can't we all be friends
Friends don't care about size
Gigantic or pint size
Like to play and have fun, not into pushing others down
Jeepers, creepers, seepers, can we all be friends?
I said jeepers, creepers, seepers, can't we all be friends?
Why can't we all? Why can't we all? Why can't we all be friends?
Why can't we all, why can't we all, why can't we all be friends?
I like all kinds of creatures
Some laugh a lot, some complain a lot
Those features make them special creatures
