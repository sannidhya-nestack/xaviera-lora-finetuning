The sun is bright and yellow
The sky is oh so blue
Mix them up into a cup
And everything turns green
Elizabeth loves red
I like blue instead
Mix them up into a cup
And everything turns purple
I see a yellow duck
By Jamie's big red truck
Mix them up into a cup and everything turns orange
Here's the thing that I have found
When you mix them all around
Everything turns a lovely shade of brown
The sun is bright and yellow
The sky is oh so blue
Mix them up into a cup
And everything turns green
Elizabeth loves red
I like blue instead
Mix them up into a cup
And everything turns purple
I see a yellow duck
By Jamie's big red truck
Mix them up into a cup and everything turns orange
Here's the thing that I have found
When you mix them all around
Everything turns a lovely shade of brown
Now I've got the tools
There aren't any rules
Mix them up into a cup
All the possibilities
Mix them up into a cup
All the possibilities
