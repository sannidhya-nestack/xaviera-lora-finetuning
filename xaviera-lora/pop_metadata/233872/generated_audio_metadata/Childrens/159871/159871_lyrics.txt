Up, up, up, up
Down, down, down, down
Up, up, up, up
Get to making with the noise boys
Hey brother you got something to say (yup)
Well walk it while you talk it
You'll like it that way
Let's walk up down (up) (okay)
Up and downtown (down, okay) down, down, down
Ooh, I like it downtown (uh-huh)
Elevator going up, up, up
Escalator going down, down, down, down
You're walking to the east, walking to the west
Now give me some piano'cause I like it best, yeah
Hey, sister, you got something to say? (Yep)
So walk it while you talk it
You'll like it that way
Up to the roof, up (Yes, ma'am) up, up
Down to the basement (down, down, down, down)
It's cool in the basement (oh yeah)
Elevator going up, up, up
Escalator going down, down, down, down
And then you walk it to the east
Walk it to the west
Give me some piano'cause I like it best
Ooh
Walkin'round the equator hotter than a percolator
Bring me little water, waiter, straight from the refrigerator
Thank you very much, thank you very much
Now listen to the man with the Midas touch
Got to make it with the noise boys
Hey brother you got something to say
Well walk it while you talk it
You'll like it that way
Put on your shoes and you snooze and you lose
Making you an offer you cannot refuse
Let's go to the North Pole
And down to the South Pole
It's cool down here
And we have walked it to the east
We've walked it to the west
Okay everybody, let's take a little rest
