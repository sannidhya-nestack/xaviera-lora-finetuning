What will we do with Little Miss Lolly Lou?
What will we do with Little Miss Lou?
She washed her toys in the washing machine
When she went to the bathroom she painted it green
Give her a ticket away
She made a big pudding in the kitchen sink
Then she painted her face with indelible ink
Give her a ticket, a one
In the chicken stew then she laughed about it'til quarter past two
Give her a ticket, a one way ticket on a leaky Fregatube Timbuktu
It's a cryin' at night and mischief all day when it's time to eat
She wants to play when it's time
When it's time to come, she runs away
So there's only one thing left to do
It's a cold hard fact, it's sad but true
Give her a ticket, a one-way ticket
On a leaky frigate to Timbuktu
Give her a ticket, a one-way ticket
