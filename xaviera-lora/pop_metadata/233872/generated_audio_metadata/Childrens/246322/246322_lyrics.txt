Sarah, I can see in your eyes
Something is bothering you, I don't know why
Sarah, tell me what can it be
Where are the smiles that I once used to see
Oh Sarah, my Sarah, Sarah
I can see in your eyes
Something is bothering you, I don't know why
Sarah, tell me what can it be
Where are the smiles that I once used to see
Is it something that I've otten
Is it something I've said or done wrong?
Have I acted unkind?
Sarah, is it I'm blind?
Don't you see that I can't read your mind?
Sarah, I can see in your eyes
Something you're hiding is hurting inside
Sarah, tell me what can it be
What is the secret you're keeping from me
Are you just trying to protect me?
Am I better off not knowing why?
If I am say the word Sarah just let me know
Right or wrong I will still love you so
Sarah I can see in your eyes
Something is bothering you and I don't know why
You're the love of my life
And I just want you to be safe in this world
And to be happy my little girl
Sarah won't you tell me what's on your mind
