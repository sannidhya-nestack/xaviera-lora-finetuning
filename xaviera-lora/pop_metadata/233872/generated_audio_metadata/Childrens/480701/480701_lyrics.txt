Well let me tell you what I tell my kids when something's hard for them to do.
Don't get mad or frustrated, take a deep breath.
Let it out, ah, and chill
Are you chillin', Danny? (Yup)
Okay, let's have some fun
Get your body dancin', lookin' good
Now when I say "chill," you freeze (okey-dokey)
Everybody ready? Here we go
Here's a song that's just for you
When you're tryin' somethin' new
Don't get mad when you can't do it
Just relax, there's nothin' to it
When you chill
Let's move again, practice one more time
Just chill, you got it
When you're hanging up your coat
Just don't throw it down and mope
Pick it up, don't cry, just do it
Gotta try, there's nothing to it
When you chill
Shake it up when it's almost time to munch
Gotta first unpack your lunch
Don't have a fit when you can't do it
Ask for help, there's nothing to it
When you chill
Gotta move, school day's over and you know
Hurry, pack your things and go
Don't feel bad when you can't do it
Take your time, there's nothing to it
When you chill
Riva! Riva! Haha!
Chill
Chill
Chill
Chill
Just chill
