Come along with me for a magic ride in the sea
Come along with me for a magic ride in the sea
Down and down we go
Where we end up, no one knows
I see colors of blue, red and orange
Water's turning, turning, turning with me
Hold my hand, it won't be scary, you'll see
Water's turning, turning, turning with me
Come along with me for a magic ride in the sea
Come along with me for a magic ride in the sea
A magic ride in the sea
