Sometimes my toes tap and my fingers wiggle
Something that if it's as deep down die in the ditch
Something you go squirm
Mine with skeeter
My breath curved
My head's bigger
I want just a bigger
I want a stomp and kick
Bubble trouble
Bounce and pop
Bubble trouble can't make it stop
Bubble trouble, blippy and loud
Bubble trouble, right here, right now
My words get jiggly and my eyebrows jump
Inside me there's a fizz and pump
All my cheeks feel puffy, I crunch my snack
All of these bubbles want to attack
Bubble trouble, bounce and pop
Bubble trouble can't make it stop
Bubble trouble, whippy and loud
Bubble trouble, right here, right now
Can bubbles be quiet? Can bubbles sit still?
I tried counting bubbles, but some wanna spill
Bubble trouble, bounce and pop
Bubble trouble, clippy and loud
Bubble trouble, right here, right now
Bubble trouble, bounce and pop
Everybody bounce
Bubble trouble, right here, right, right now
