Sky so blue and clouds like bunnies
Trees so high, air like honey
Wanna go spend all my money or
Give it all away
Cause I like you, you're so funny
We'd be friends on days so sunny
Got no cares, not a single oney
Only time to play
Follow me
Follow me
I go marching down the street
Ha cha cha chi chi chi
Follow me
Follow me
One two three one two three one two three
Here comes Scooty, here comes Badger
Here comes Sawyer and Little Bo
Here comes Scooty, here comes Badger
Follow me wherever I go
I'm a parade, I'm a parade
I got it made in the shade
I'm a parade, I like lemonade
I'm a parade
Got a shiny red cape and a big stick
You're a ninja, I'm a pirate
We could fight or we could just quit
That'd be okay
We take turns, who's the leader?
I'll be Wendy, you be Peter
We could fly, I might two-seater
Hey, what do you say?
Follow me, follow me
I go marching down the street
Hot cha cha, chi chi chi
Follow me, follow me
One two three, one two three, one two three
Here comes Scooty, here comes Badger
Here comes Sawyer and Little Bo
Here comes Scooty, here comes Badger
Follow me wherever I go
I'm a parade
I'm a parade
I got it made
In the shade
I'm a parade
I like lemonade
I'm a parade
We could dance, we could laugh
Then go home and take a bath
Make a sandwich, I'll give you half with
Jelly or just plain
We can wrestle on the floor
Take a nap and have a snore
Every time I love you more
Each and every day
Follow me
Follow me
I go marching down the street
Hot cha cha, chi chi chi
Follow me
Follow me
One two three, one two three, one two three
Here comes Scooty, here comes Badger
Here comes Sawyer and Little Bo
Here comes Scooty, here comes Badger
Follow me wherever I go
I'm a parade
I'm a parade
I got it made
In the shade
I'm a parade
I like lemonade
I'm a parade
Here comes Scooty
Here comes Badger
Here comes Sawyer and Little Bo
Here comes Scooty
Here comes Badger
Follow me wherever I go
I'm a parade
I'm afraid
I got it made
In the shade
I'm afraid
I like lemonade
I'm afraid
