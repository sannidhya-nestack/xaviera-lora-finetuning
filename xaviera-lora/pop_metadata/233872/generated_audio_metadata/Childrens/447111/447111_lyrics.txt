For the children, for the children
For the children, we must plant the seeds
And give them hope
For the future and a reason that they can't believe
For the children, for the children, for the children
We must turn on the lights so they can shine brighter than ever
Just like the stars that come out at night
And the children sing
And the children sing
Love the children, love the children
Love the children, so that they can grow strong
And give them room, enough to discover
And help them learn, what's right and what's wrong
Love the children, love the children
Love the children and the hate will be gone
And the children sing
And the children sing
It doesn't matter what color you are
It doesn't matter what religion you are
As long as you believe
As long as you believe
For the children
For the children
For the children
We must plant the seeds
And give them hope
For the future
And a reason that they can't believe
Hold the children, hold the children
Hold the children when they're scared at night
And sing the song that they can dream too
And the children sing
And the children sing
(laughing)
