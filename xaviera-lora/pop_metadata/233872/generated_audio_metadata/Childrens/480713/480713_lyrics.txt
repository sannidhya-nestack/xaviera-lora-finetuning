Went to the firehouse the other day
My friend the firefighter began to say
Don't play with fire, matches aren't for you
If your clothes catch on fire, here's what you gotta do
Gotta stop, drop, rock and roll
Stop, drop, rock and roll
Gotta keep you safe, so do what you're told
Stop, drop, rock and roll
Back at school, sitting in my class
The fire alarm sounds with a loud loud blast
I stay calm and get in line
Follow fire rules, I'll be just fine
Gotta stop, drop, rock and roll
Stop, drop, rock and roll
Gotta keep you safe, so do what you're told
Stop, drop, rock and roll
Even at home there are rules to learn
Get smoke detectors so you don't get burned
If there's a fire don't run and hide
Leave your toys and get outside
Gotta stop, drop, rock and roll
Stop, drop, rock and roll
Gotta keep you safe so do what you're told
Stop, drop, rock and roll
Now stop
Now drop
Now roll
Stand up, here we go
Gotta stop, drop, rock and roll
Stop, drop, rock and roll
Gotta keep you safe, so do what you're told
Stop, drop, rock and roll
Gotta keep you safe, so do what you're told
Stop, drop, rock and roll
