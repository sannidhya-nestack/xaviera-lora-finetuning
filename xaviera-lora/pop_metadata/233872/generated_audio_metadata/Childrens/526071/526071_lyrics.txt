One, two, three, count with me
One, two, three, look and see
How easy it is to count to three
Four, five, six, like picking up sticks
One, two, three, four, five, six
With the sticks we count to six
Seven, eight, nine and ten
Are you ready to do it all over again?
Cause it's so fun to count to ten
Birds are flying overhead
Watch me count them up to ten
I just have to start with one, two, three
One, two, three, count with me
One, two, three, look and see
How easy it is to count to three
Four, five, six, like picking up sticks
One, two, three, four, five, six
With the sticks we count to six
Seven, eight, nine and ten
Are you ready to do it all over again?
Cause it's so fun to count to ten
Tiny fingers on my hands
Watch me count them up to ten
I just have to start with one, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three, look and see
How easy it is to count to three
Won't you stay and count with me?
