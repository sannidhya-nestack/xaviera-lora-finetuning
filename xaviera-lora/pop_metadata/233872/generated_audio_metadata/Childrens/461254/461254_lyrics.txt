Jump, jump
Jump, jump
Jump, jump
It makes me want to scream and shout
It makes me want to dance about
It's a carnival inside my head
Jump, jump, jump
Reeling in a frenzied state
My nerves are starting to outbreak
I'm hanging by the thinnest thread
Jump, jump, jump
Everything is possible
When gravity has lost its pull
Soaring up above the crowds
Flying high among the clouds
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Am I asleep or in a dream
Are my desires too extreme
It seems like I could almost fly
Jump jump jump
Everything is possible
When gravity has lost its pull
Soaring up above the crowds
Flying high among the clouds
Jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Oh, if I ever have to land, it would be more than I could stand
I'd want to get that feeling back, jump, jump, jump
The past is all sits through for me, I see new possibilities
I want to take a whole new tack, jump, jump, jump
Everything is possible
When gravity has lost its pull
Soaring up above the clouds
Flying high among the clouds
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
A rubber ball to spin and top
I never want this ride to stop
I feel that I could touch the sky
Jump, jump, jump
