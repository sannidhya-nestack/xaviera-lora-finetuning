So many giggles in my chest
A skip in my step, feeling blessed
All my mates are calling me
Time to shine, let's all break free
Life is metal and we live off strife
We laugh till we glow from day to night
Sing it loud, let the melody flow
A brand new vibe where our bright hearts roll
Bouncing through roads with laughter bold
Trading our secrets shining like gold
Never alone when we feel this strong
We keep it real right where we belong
Sound through roads with a laughter bowl
Trading our secrets shining like gold
Never alone when we feel this strong
We keep it real right to where we belong
Sometimes the world tries to weigh me down
But I'm rising up, no chance to frown
Each footstep sparks my own clear voice
Catching the moment, I rejoice
Woah, let's sing it high
Woah, watch our spirits fly
So, let's sing it high
Woah, watch our spirits light
Woah
Life is better when we link arms tight
We laugh till we glow from day to night
Sing it loud, let the melody flow
A brand new vibe where our bright hearts glow
Class along, let the good times bring
All for one, that's how we sing
