Sky so bright we're feeling bold
Hopes take flight when stories are told
Skipping stones by shimmering lights
Giggling till our tummy aches
Oh, oh, oh, can't you feel the rhythm rise?
Oh, oh, oh, we've got wonder in our eyes
We'll run so far, we'll shine so bright
This is our moment day or night
Tying our laces to chase the sun
Each brand new day has just begun
Friends in a queue for something new
We paint the streets in rainbow hue
Keep that sparkle in your eyes
Smallest hopes can touch the skies
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can't you feel the rhythm rise?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, we've got wonder in our eyes
We'll run so far and we'll shine so bright
This is our moment day or night
Laughing at jokes only we can see
Our hidden giggles set us free
No big secrets nothing to fear
We dance and sing cause we belong here
Oh, oh, oh, can't you feel the rhythm rise?
Oh, oh, oh, we've got wonder in our eyes
We'll run so far, we'll shine so bright
This is our moment, day or night
Day or night, keep dancing on
Hearts ablaze in every song
We'll hold these memories shining strong
this is where we all belong
Day or night keep dancing on
Hearts ablaze in every song
We'll hold these memories shining strong
Cause this is where we all belong
