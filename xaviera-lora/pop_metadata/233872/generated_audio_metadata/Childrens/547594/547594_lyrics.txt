Sleep, sleep, my sweet little child
Sleep, sleep, sweet baby of mine
I'll hold you tender with arms full of care
Let your eyes surrender to the sweet song you hear
Dream, dream of skies soft and blue
Dream, dream I'll wait here for you
I'll count every second, I'll count every breath
Rock you and gently kiss your head
As you sleep, sleep, now don't shed a tear
Sleep, sleep, now mommy is near
No brow will be broken, no baby will fall
There's nothing to fear here at all
As you sleep, sleep
