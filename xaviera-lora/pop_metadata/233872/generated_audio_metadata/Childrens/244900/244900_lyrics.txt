Paul Bunyan was a giant of a man
He could clear a forest with his mighty axe
No, not a tree would stand
No, not a tree would stand
When Paul yelled, "Timber !"
A tree shook in the ground
With every yell and every swing
At least a hundred trees came falling down
At least a hundred trees came falling down
He could blow birds out of the air with a sneeze
Paul was so tall he towered over the tallest of trees
From Wisconsin to Minnesota
North Dakota to California
Paul roamed and he rambled while his ox named Babe
Trampled hills along the way
Trampled hills along the way
He could blow birds out of the air with a sneeze
Paul was so tall, he towered over the tallest of trees
No logging job was too big, took any challenge that he could
Paul felled the trees of the far west, Douglas firs and redwoods
He could blow birds out of the air with a sneeze
Paul was so tall, he towered over the tallest of trees
Paul Bunyan was the giant of a man
He could clear a forest with his mighty axe
No, not a tree would stand
Oh, not a tree would stand
No, not a tree would stand
