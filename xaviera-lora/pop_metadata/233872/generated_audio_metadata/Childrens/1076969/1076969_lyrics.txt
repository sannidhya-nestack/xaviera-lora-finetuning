Open flower, rise up to the sun
Life has just begun for you
Little child, the world is all so new
And there's so much time for loving you
But now it's time to say goodnight
Our love for you will hold you tight
We'll tuck you in as dreams caress you
Say a prayer and God will bless you
Give a kiss sweet dreams my baby
The eyes will have tonight to rest
So they will shine their very best
Tomorrow, open flower, we all love you so
And it's love that makes us grow, you know
And every child of love will grow
Yes, every child of love will grow
Goodnight my baby
Goodnight now sleep tight
