It's often said we're parting
Goodbye to our dear kindergarten
Farewell, we're off to learn and play
Goodbye to kindergarten days
So long teachers, so long friends
So long'til we meet again
Farewell
It's awfully sad we're parting
Goodbye to our dear kindergarten
Farewell, we're off to learn and play
Goodbye to kindergarten days
So long teachers, so long friends
So long'til we meet again
Farewell
It's awfully sad we're partying
Goodbye to our dear kindergarten
Farewell, we're off to learn and play
Goodbye to kindergarten days
Goodbye to kindergarten days
