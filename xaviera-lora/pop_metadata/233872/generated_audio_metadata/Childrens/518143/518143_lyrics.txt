Camp town ladies sing this song, do-da, do-da
Camp town race track, twelve miles long, oh, do-do-da-day
Gonna run all night, gonna run all day
I bet my money on a bucktail match, somebody get on the bay
I came down here with my hat turned in
Doo-dah, doo-dah
I'll go back home with a pocket full of tin
Oh, doo-doo-dah-ding
Gonna run all night
Gonna run all day
I'll bet my money on a Bob-Town bag
Somebody bet on the bay
Camp town ladies sing this song
Doo-dah, doo-dah
Camp town racetrack, five miles long
Oh, doo-doo-dah day
Gonna run all night
Gonna run all day
I bet my money on a bottle neck
Somebody bet on the bay
I came down here with my hat turned in
Doo-dah, doo-dah
I go back home with a pocket full of tin
Oh, doo-doo-dah day
Gonna run all night
Gonna run all day
I'll bet my money on a bobtail neck
Somebody bet on the bay
Gonna run all night
Gonna run all day
I'll bet my money on a bobtail neck
Somebody bet on the bay
