Starlight twinkle so bright like a bird that flies in my room at night and it feels so nice
Starlight
All around the world you shine
So little boys and girls like I
Can see you in the sky
Starlight
Moonlight glowing in the night like an old man with a flashlight
And you shine down on me, moonlight
All around the world you shine
So little boys and girls like I
Can see you in the sky
Moonlight
Night light with your little light
How you shine so bright on my wall at night
And I'm safe tonight with my night light
Only in my room you shine
And no one really knows that I
I need to see your light
My night light
And moonlight
And starlight
