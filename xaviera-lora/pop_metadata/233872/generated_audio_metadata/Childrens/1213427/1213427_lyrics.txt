If I had a wish, then she would be mine
If he had a wish
I'm sure it would be fine
But why don't all my dreams come true
I know that I belong with you
Together
We want to be together
Your company forever, yes ever, evermore
Together, we'll always be together
In harmony forever
you're the one I adore
If I had a wish, then I'd ask for her
If he had his wish, I'd hope he'd really care
But why must my heart be made to ache?
What a wonderful companion I'd make
Together
We want to be together
Your company forever
Yes, ever
Evermore
Together
We'll always be together in harmony forever
you're the one I adore
