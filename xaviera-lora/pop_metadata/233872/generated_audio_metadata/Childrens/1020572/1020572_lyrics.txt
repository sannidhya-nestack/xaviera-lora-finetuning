Sing a song of sixpence, a pocket full of rye
Four and twenty blackbeards baked in a pie
When the pie was opened the birds began to sing
Wasn't that a dainty dish to set before the king?
The king was in his counting house counting all his money
The queen was in the parlour eating bread and honey
The maid was in the garden, hanging out the clothes
And down came a blackbird and pecked off her nose
Sing a song of sixpence, a pocket full of rye
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie
When the pie was up and the birds began to sing
Wasn't that a dainty dish to set before the king?
The king was in his counting house, counting all his money
The queen was in the parlour, eating bread and honey
The maid was in the garden, hanging out the plants
And down came a blackbird and pecked off her nose
Sing a song of sixpence, a pocket full of rye
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie
When the pie was opened the birds began to sing
Wasn't that a dainty dish to set before the king?
The king was in his counting house counting all his money
The queen was in the parlour eating bread and honey
The maid was in the garden hanging out the plant
And down came a blackbird and pecked off her nose
Sing a song of sixpence, a pocket full of rye
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie
When the pie was opened the birds began to sing
Wasn't that a dainty dish to set before the king
The king was in his counting house counting all his money
The queen was in the parlour eating bread and honey
The maid was in the garden hanging out the plants
And down came a blackbird and pecked off her nose
