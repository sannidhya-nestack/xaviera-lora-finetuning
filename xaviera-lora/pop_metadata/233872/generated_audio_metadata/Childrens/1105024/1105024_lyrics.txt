I've got a little table, I've got a little chair
I've got a little tea cup for a little teddy bear
We'll sit down at the table and play at cups of tea
And then we'll go and have a walk, my teddy bear and me
My teddy is a softy with a ribbon on his neck
He's got a little brown nose, his eyes are small and black
I keep him in my toy box if he's not in my bed
And sometimes to be funny I'll stand him on his head
Oh Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, you are the best of friends
Oh Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, you are the best of friends
I've got a little bicycle with space up on the back
To put my ready teddy and go riding down the track
I'm careful not to hit a bump so teddy won't fall out
Going round and round the garden you can hear me shout
Oh Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, you are the best of friends
Oh Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, you are the best of friends
Looking through my toy box
There's lots of lovely toys
There's blocks and beads and a tambourine
For making lots of noise
If Teddy plays the trumpet
While I play the drums
We can sing a little song
And look out here it comes
Oh Teddy Teddy Teddy Ted, you are the best of friends
Oh Teddy Teddy Teddy Ted, you are the best of friends
Oh Teddy Teddy Teddy Ted, you are the best friends
Oh Teddy Teddy Teddy Ted, you are the best friend
