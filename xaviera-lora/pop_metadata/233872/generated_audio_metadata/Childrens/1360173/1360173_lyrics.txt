When I clap my hands, I feel so free
You can do it too, just follow me
We clap them high, we clap them low (Hooray!)
Everybody join in, let's play
Can you clap, clap, clap along
Clap once, clap twice, make it strong
Clap your hands with me
One, two, three
Rhythm in the air, let it be
Left and right, up to the sky
Together we clap
Give it a try, clap, clap, clap, come on let's see
All our happy hands in harmony
Clap, clap, everybody clap with me
Clap, clap, feel the joy so easy
When you're clapping, smiles appear
You bring the fun, you bring good cheer
Fast or slow, any way you please
Clapping together, just like a breeze
Can you clap, clap, clap along
Clap in a circle, join the song
Clap your hands with me
One, two, three
Rhythm in the air, let it be
Left and right, up to the sky
Together we clap
Give it a try
Clap, clap, clap, come on, let's see
All our happy hands in harmony
Clap, clap, everybody clap with me
Clap, clap, feel the joy, so easy
If you're feeling giggly, clap your hands
If you're feeling wiggly, clap your hands
Anytime and anywhere, clap your hands
Clap, clap, clap, clap your hands
Your hands with me
So rhythm in the air, let it be
Left and right up to the sky
Together we clap, give it a try
Clap, clap, clap, come on let's see
All our happy hands in harmony
Clap, clap, clap, clap your hands
