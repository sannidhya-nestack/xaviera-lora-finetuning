Papa grew the sweetest corn for miles around
Working sun up'til sundown
And in the morning I had my chores to do
Before I walked that dirt road to school
But there were lights sitting on the front porch swing
Watching the fireflies dancing
And I could smell the roses on the summer breeze
Then you'd hold me close and sing me to sleep
You'd sing, "Hush, my baby, don't you cry"
Mama's gonna sing a lullaby
Oh, rest your head upon my knee
The angels will watch you sleep
The angels will watch you sleep
It was harvest time when you passed on
Now the days are cold and the nights are long
And I'm waiting for this winter to depart
As I fight the chill that's in my heart
But the homestead stands on solid ground
And there'll be corn when fall comes'round
And at night I hold my little girl close to me
And I think of you as I sing her to sleep
I sing, "Hush, my baby, don't you cry"
Mama's gonna sing a lullaby
Oh rest your head upon my knee
The angels will watch you sleep
The angels will watch you sleep
There's lightning in the northern sky
But the hay is in safe and dry
So rest your head upon my knee
The angels will watch you sleep
The angels will watch you sleep
Oh, the angels will watch you sleep
