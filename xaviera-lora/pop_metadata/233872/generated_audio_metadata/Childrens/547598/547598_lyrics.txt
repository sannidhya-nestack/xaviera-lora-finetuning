Run to the haystack, run to the pen
Run little chickadees back to mother hen
Two little chickadees looking for some more
Along came another two and they made four
Four little chickadees hopping over sticks
Along came another two and they made six
Six little chickadees perching on a gate
Along came another two and they made eight
Eight little chickadees ran to the pen
Along came another two and they made ten
Run to the haystack, run to the pen
Run little chickadees back to mother hen
Two little chickadees looking for some more
Along came another two and they made four
Four little chickadees hopping over sticks
Along came another two and they made six
Six little chickadees perching on a gate
Along came another two and they made eight
Eight little chickadees ran to the pen
Along came another two and they made ten
Run to the haystack, run to the pen
Run little chickadees back to mother hen
Run to the haystack, run to the pen
Run little chickadees back to mother hen
