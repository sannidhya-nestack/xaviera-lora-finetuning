I'm on the ocean again
I'm back with all of my friends
Protected by a new fancy dome
And my new and wonderful home
My crib has a brand new look
And dude it's off the hook
The coolest place that I've ever known
Is my new and wonderful home
Glimmer through a party
For the pilgrims and for me
Entering the celebration
They handed me the key
To the place where my story is told
To visitors young and old
And best of all I feel ten feet tall in my new and wonderful home
Limit through a party for the pilgrims and for me
And during the celebration they handed me the key
To the place where my story is told to visitors young and old
And best of all I feel ten feet tall in my new and wonderful home
And best of all I feel ten feet tall in my new and wonderful home
Hooray
