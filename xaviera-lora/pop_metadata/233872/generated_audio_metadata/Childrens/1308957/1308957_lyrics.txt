Wake up, stretch high, touch the sky
Feel the sunshine, say hello, goodbye
Grab my sneakers, tie'em tight
Today's the day we take off and fly
Jump, spin, fly, reach up so high
Dance to the rhythm, touch the blue sky
No rules, just fun, let's go, don't stop
Let's make today the best we've got
Jump, spin, slide, everybody try
Clap, clap, shake, wave your hands up high
Laugh so loud, let your feet touch the ground
We're on a wild adventure all around
Oh-oh-oh-oh, side step, left
Do a little twirl, this is our day
Let's rock the world
Colors so bright, music so loud
Sing it out strong, let's move with the crowd
Jump, spin, fly, reach up so high
Dance to the rhythm, touch the blue sky
No rules, just fun, let's go, don't stop
Let's make today the best we've got
Jump, spin, fly, everybody try
Clap, clap, shake, wave your hands up high
Laugh so loud, let your feet touch the ground
We're on a wild adventure all around
Burn like the wind, chase the sun
Every day's a party, let's have some fun
Jump real high, touch the stars
No matter where you are, you're a superstar
Jump, spin, fly, everybody try
Clap, clap, shake, wave your hands up high
Laugh so loud, let your feet touch the ground
We're on a wild adventure all around
Jump, spin, fly
Keep on dancing, reach for the sky
