A little grasshopper had a difficult day, and he was very frustrated.
He tried so hard to hold it in, he almost became asphyxiated.
But his mom came over to see what was the matter, and patted his sweet little head.
"My dear boy, are you having a rough time?" she peered into him as she said.
It's okay to cry when you need to express some deep feelings pushed way down inside.
Find a quiet place to let out the emotions you've tried really hard to hide.
After the water's rush, you can wipe your tears and move on with renewed hope.
And soon this tough day will feel far away
And you'll have learned how to cope
And the little grasshopper finally understood
It's okay to cry
Then one day the grasshopper found a boy on a curb
With a heart filled full of tears
He'd lost his favorite puppy friend
And this confirmed his greatest fears
That he'd have to live life without his very best friend
And have to learn to let him go
What he didn't realize just yet
Was that his heart had learned to grow
So the grasshopper hopped on the concrete curb and rested his head on the boy's hand.
He smiled at the sad little boy and said, "I hope you can understand.
It's okay to cry when you say goodbye to someone you truly love.
Just don't et you're not alone here."
The Great Spirit watches from above.
When we love deeply, and they have to go
It can feel like the very end
But what if it's just a curve in the road
And we can learn to love again?
So the boy and the green grasshopper sat on the edge of the curb together,
And their gentle tears flowed softly, and they knew they'd be friends forever.
And the boy and the grasshopper understood.
It's okay to cry.
