I have a dog, his name is Rags
He eats so much, his tummy sags
His ears flip flop, his tail wig wags
And when he walks, he walks zig zag
He goes flip flop wig wag, zig zag
He goes flip flop wig wag, zig zag
He goes flip flop wig wag, zig zag
I love rags and he loves me
My dog rags, he loves to play
He rolls around in the mud all day
I whistle, he won't obey
He always runs the other way
He goes flip flop wig wag, zig zag
He goes flip flop wig wag, zig zag
He goes flip flop wig wag, zig zag
I love Rags and he loves me
I love Rags and he loves me
