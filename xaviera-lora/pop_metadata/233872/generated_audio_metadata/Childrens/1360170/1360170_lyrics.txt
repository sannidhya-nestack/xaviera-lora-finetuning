Stomp a stomp, step by step, marching through the meadow grass
Antsie ants are angry, moving much too fast
Bouncing boots and busy paws, bustling in a row
Ants with attitude onward they go
Wiggle wiggle waggle, who's got the grump
Giggle, giggle, gabble
Feel that thump
Ants are angry but they dance
They're too happy but they're
Shaking out their silly stance
Mark their silly ten
Tapping, stomping feet
Anto hey and ho
Show your feet
Red hats rattling, rumbly ramps
Tick-tock, tempers in a tangled dance
Swishing, swaying, swinging in line
Frowning faces turn to shine
Wiggle, wiggle, waggle, grumbles go away
Giggle, giggle, gavel, it's time to play
Ants are angry but they dance (they keep bumpin' but they)
Shake it out their silly stance (bumpin' out their silly stance)
Kept tapping, stomping feet
Ants make anger upbeat
Ants don't hate at home
Jump to the beat, everybody stomp, stomp, stomp
Everybody clap, clap, clap
If you're ever angry let's twist and tap
Fuzzy busy buddies know it's okay to feel
Anger's just an anti-thing, stomp and squeal
Laughing, leaping, let it go
Happy hearts start to glow
Ants are angry but they dance (are angry but they)
Shaking out their silly stance (stance after silly)
Slapping, tapping, stomping feet
Ants make anger up beat
Ants go hey! Ant ho!
Show your feet, so stop, stop
Twist around, let your angry ants be found
March together, turn the storm
Smile and stretch, feel the warmth
