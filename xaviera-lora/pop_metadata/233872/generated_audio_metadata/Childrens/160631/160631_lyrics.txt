It doesn't rain here every day
A person can et
But rain drops make a lot of noise
And they make a person wet
But I'll put on my raincoat
Put on my rain boots too
And I'll jump on my reindeer
And rain drop in on you
One hundred rain drops
One hundred waves
One hundred people
Pass for eighty days
What if it rained inside my house instead of in my yard
And upstairs it rained softly and downstairs it rained hard
My mother's shoes would start to float like toy boats in the rain
My dolls would put on hats and boots
But my cat would just complain
One hundred rain drops
One hundred waves
One hundred people pass the rainy days
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty
Ninety, ninety-one, ninety-two, ninety-three, ninety-four
Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine
Do do do do do, do do do do do do, do do do do do
I think I'll catch a raindrop and bring it home with me
We'll have a tiny little time and we'll drink some tiny tea
And when the clouds say all aboard and my raindrop says goodbye
I'll say I'll see you next time
That your cloud is in my sky
One hundred rain drops, one hundred waves
One hundred people pass the rainy days
One hundred rain drops, one hundred waves
One hundred people
Passed the rainy days
One hundred
