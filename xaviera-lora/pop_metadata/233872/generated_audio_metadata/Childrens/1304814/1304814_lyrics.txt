We gather in the park with endless spark
Laughter rings from morning'til dark
Skipping ropes and silly clues
Every giggle we never lose
Oh let's go, let's sing out loud
Dance away in our lively crowd
Clapping hands, we always grin
Feel the vibe, let fun begin
Raise your voice, let good times show
Oh, oh, let's go, let's go, let's go
Footsteps patter across the green
Cheeky faces in between
Tiny secrets that we share
Friendship shining everywhere
Hold that laughter in your heart
No matter if we drift apart
Oh, let's go, let's sing out loud
Dance away in our lively crowd
Clapping hands, we always grin
Feel the vibe, let fun begin
Raise your voice, let good times show, oh-oh
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Echoes ring as we leap and glide
In each hop we hold our pride
We might stumble but we rise
Smiling wide with shining eyes
Oh let's go, let's sing out loud
Dance away in our lively crowd
Clapping hands we always grin
Feel the vibe let fun begin
Raise your voice let good times show
Oh oh let's go let's go let's go
When the music starts to slow
Memories stay and on we glow
