Okay, are you ready? (Yeah!) I mean really ready? (Yay!)
Let's get those hands ready to clap. One, two, three!
Trusting it all for you
Inhibitions pushed away
No matter what I do
Don't wanna be afraid
Being kind
Is what we'll find
Open up our hearts
Be our favorite part
It's okay to be nervous
It's okay to be curious
How do you feel
Being friends for real
You ready for the chorus?
I know you guys are
One, two, three
I don't wanna lie to you
I just wanna stand by you
I don't wanna lie to you
Hold my hand, we can be
We can be friends
I don't wanna lie to you
I just wanna stand by you
I don't wanna lie to you
Hold my hand
We can be friends
Just when our world's falling apart
I took a free dive to you
Shedding unfairness and favorites and favorites and favorites
Gonna be courageous, it's contagious, it's contagious, contagious
It's okay to be nervous
It's okay to be curious (you can be friends)
How do you feel?
Being friends for real
You ready for the chorus?
I know you guys are!
I don't wanna lie to you (I don't wanna lie to you)
I just wanna stand by you (I don't wanna lie to you)
Hold my hand, we can be (we can be friends)
I don't wanna lie to you (I don't wanna lie to you)
I just wanna stand by you
I don't wanna lie to you
Hold my hand, we can be
Friends
Friends
Friends
