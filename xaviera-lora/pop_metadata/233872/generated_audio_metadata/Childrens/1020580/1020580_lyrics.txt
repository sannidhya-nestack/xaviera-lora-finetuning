Three blind mice, three blind mice
See how they run, see how they run
They all ran after the farmer's wife
Who cut off their tails with a carving knife
Did you ever see such a thing in your life
As three blind mice, three blind mice
Three blind mice
See how they run
See how they run
They all went after the farmer's wife
Who cut off their tails with a carving knife
Did you ever see such a thing in your life
As three blind mice
Three blind mice
Three blind mice
See how they run
See how they run
They all run after the farmer's wife
Who cut off their tails with a carving knife
Did you ever see such a thing in your life
As three blind mice
Three blind mice
Three blind mice
See how they run
See how they run
They all run after the farmer's wife
Who cut off their tails with a carving knife
Did you ever see such a thing in your life?
As three blind mice
