Jimmy's a boy who lives down the block, he got a wonderful thing
It's a gym set from his parents with slides and ropes and swings
Now all the kids wish they could have one, they all envy him
The way he swoops and hangs in the air, they call him Jungle Jim
Everybody say, "Oh-oh"
Just like a monkey out on a limb
Everybody say, "Oh-oh"
Grab the rope and swing with Jungle Jim
Now Jimmy's got friends he never knew
They lined up down the street
They want to climb his brand new toys
So they suddenly are sweet
Now kids who never said hello
Act like his long lost pals
And girls who used to stick up their nose
Are now his lovely gals
Everybody say ooh
Just like a monkey out on a limb
Everybody say ooh
Grab the rope and swing with Jumbo Jim
Swing high, swing low, swing bow, to and fro
Hey come on swing high, swing low, swing back
Look out down below
Now Betty she gets up to the top she makes a big mistake
She looks straight down to the very bottom and slams on her brakes
Now all the kids they call up to her
Come on down dey slide
She shuts her eyes to take the plunge
Now she wants another ride
Everybody say ooh ooh ooh
Just like a monkey out on a limb
Everybody say ooh ooh ooh
Grab the rope and swing with Jungle Jim
Everybody say ooh ooh ooh
Just like a monkey out on a limb
Everybody say ooh ooh ooh
Grab the rope and swing with Jungle Jim
Everybody say, "Oh-oh"
Just like a monkey out on the limb
Everybody say, "Oh-oh"
Grab the rope and swing with Jungle Jim
Everybody say, "Oh-oh"
