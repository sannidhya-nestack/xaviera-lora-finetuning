In June it was my birthday
There were a lot of boys and girls
Balloons and birthday cake and nonsense and noise
I got the coolest toy you've ever seen
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It's kinda like a robot, and it's kinda like a truck
Like it's mother was a tractor, and it's father was a duck
It's nose is like a little night light flashing in the dark
It's voice is kinda like a quack and kinda like a bark
This toy does everything if you know what I mean
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It always lets me win when we play checkers or go fish
And if I rub its belly, it grants me one good wish
And when I ask what's 2 +2 this toy will answer 4
And when I'm playing basketball this toy is keeping score
And in the bathtub it's my submarine
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It sits with me at dinner time and I whisper in its ear
And it can make the broccoli and the limas disappear
it knows I will not eat food that's green
It's teaching me to play the tambourine
It scares away the ghosts on Halloween
I tell you it's a crazy machine
It's a crazy machine
It's a crazy machine
It's a crazy machine
It's a crazy machine
When all my friends come here to play
We really trash the place
we're about the messiest people in the human race
Mom sees the damage
Looks as though she might burst into tears
When luckily, just in the nick of time, my toy appears
And whirls and spins around, emitting steam and squeaks and toots
It picks up sandwich crusts and gum, yo-yos and Barbie's boots
Next thing you know, the house is sparkling clean
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
Next Sunday is Mama's birthday
I asked her what she'd like
A hat, a puppy, a trip to Spain
A hula hoop, a bike
She smiled in a way I've never seen
I want a crazy machine (I want a crazy machine)
She said, I want a crazy machine (I want a crazy machine)
She said she wants a crazy machine (I want a crazy machine)
Get me a crazy machine (I want a crazy machine)
She said, it's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (oh yeah, it's a crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (it's a really crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
I'm a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
I'm a crazy machine (it's a crazy machINE)
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machine)
I'm a crazy machine, yes, I'm a crazy machine
It's a crazy machine (it's a crazy machINE)
I'm a crazy machine, oh yes, yes, yes, I'm a crazy machine
I'm a crazy machine, oh yes, I'm a crazy machine
Oh yes, I'm a crazy machine
