Neon goo in all my jars
Swirlin' bright like shootin' stars
Stretchy ribbons, scented green
Dip your hands and watch the sheen
Feels so cool to watch it flow
Glossy drips that gleam below
Gigglin' loud and wiggly fun
Sparkly blobs for everyone
Lime-ra-nia
Candida
Colors wave before each eye
Squishy squirt you give it a try
Slime mania can't deny
Crackly foam and rainbow hues
Bouncy loops, a playful muse
Pass it round, we're all amused
Sticky thrill, we gladly use
Feels so cool to watch it flow
Glossy drips that gleam below
Giggling loud and wiggly fun
Sparkly blobs for everyone
If it clings we share a grin
Fold and fold let new shapes begin
Messy moments shine in bold
This wobbly joy never grows old
Slime-ia
Can't deny
Colours wade before each eye
Squishy squishy give it a try
Slime mania can't deny
When the day drifts off too soon
Glow in the dark forms magic tunes
Tucked in memory we can find
Slime mania's always on our mind
When the day drifts off too soon
Glow in the dark forms magic tunes
Tucked in emerald weekend signs
Slime mania's always on our mind
