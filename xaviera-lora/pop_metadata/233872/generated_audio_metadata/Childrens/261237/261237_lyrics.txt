Born on a garbage scow, far away from land
The food we ate was terrible, the smell I could hardly stand
Fighting with the seagulls for scraps too small to chew
I needed me some nourishment or soon I would be through
So I made myself a ship, left my neighborhood behind
Set out on the ocean blue to see what I could find
I was oh so glad to be away from the garbage and the flies
So began my lifelong quest, my endless search for pies
They call me Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete the Pirate
Sailing from sea to sea in search of pies
The name is Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete the Pirate
I'm a rat who likes to float
I'm a rodent on a boat
Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete the Pirate
I've been all over this world and it should come as no surprise
That I like to sail to Italy to get some pizza pies
I like rockaberry chocolate banana cream pies they're also very sweet
And I'll tell you this I never met a pie that I didn't eat
They call me Pete Pete Pete Pete the Pie Rat
Sailing from sea to sea in search of pies
The name is Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete the Pirate
I'm a rat who likes to float
I'm a rodent on a boat
They call me Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete the Pirate
They call me Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete the Pie Rat
Sailing from sea to sea in search of pies
The name is Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete the Pie Rat
I'm a rat who likes to float
I'm a rodent on a boat
They call me Pete
Pete, Pete, Pete the Pirate
I'm a rat who likes to float
I'm a rodent on a boat
They call me Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete the Pirate
