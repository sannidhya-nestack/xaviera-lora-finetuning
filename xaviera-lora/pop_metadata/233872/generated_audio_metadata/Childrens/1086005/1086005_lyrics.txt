Ah, ah, ah
Swimming so deep
It's quiet, sometimes lonely
Wish I could find a place to sleep
I am so large outside
But small and scared inside
Will you be my friend?
And help me hide
This is my last song, you hear me please
We can be best friends, I'll never leave
This is my last song, you hear me please
We can be best friends, I'll never leave, I'll never leave
Let's go to barrier reefs, we will be friends for keeps
Swimming with whales can be fun, together we can glide waters under the sun
This is my will song, you hear me please (this is my will song)
We can be best friends, I'll never leave (I'll never leave)
This is my will song, you hear me please
We can be best friends, I'll never leave, I'll never leave
I'll never, I'll never leave (never leave)
I'll never, I'll never, I'll never leave (I'll never leave)
