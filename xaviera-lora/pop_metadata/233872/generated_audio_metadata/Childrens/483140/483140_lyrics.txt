Seahorses can't hold hands, just tails
They're very small, not big like whales
Now bob like a seahorse
Bob like a seahorse
Bob, Bob, Bob like a seahorse
We hold our breath by holding our nose
A whale holds its breath when it's blow hold is closed

Won't win any races'cause they move real slow
Step slow like a sea star (step slow)
Step slow like a sea star (step real slow)
Slow, slow, slow like a sea star
Octopi's eight arms wave at me (howdy)
They taste with their arms, not their tongues, you see

Where they hatch and a dark dig out of the sand
Now dig like a sea turtle shh shh shh shh
Dig like a sea turtle

Crabs don't get ahead, they move side to side
On the beach they just might pinch you and hide
They'll pinch like a crab, pinch like a crab
Pinch, pinch, pinch like a crab
