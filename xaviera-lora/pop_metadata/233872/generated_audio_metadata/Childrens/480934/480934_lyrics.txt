Backpack packing in the summertime
Backpack packing in the wintertime
Backpack packing almost all the time
He'll be in your town very soon
He'll be in your town soon
Pack, pack, packing in the summertime (summertime)
Pack, pack, packing in the wintertime (wintertime)
Pack, pack, packing almost all the time (all the time)
He'll be in your home very soon (very soon)
He'll be in your home soon (soon)
Please pass me the french bread
Sweet potato too
Add some cranberry relish
Wash it down with something blue
A simple turkey stuffing
A perfect pumpkin pie
Please pass a hunk of turkey
Pile it up to the sky
Back, back, backing in the summertime
Back, back, backing in the wintertime
Back, back, backing almost all the time
He'll be in your heart very soon
He'll be in your heart soon
