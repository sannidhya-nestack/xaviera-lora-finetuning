Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Little boy
Little girl, find yourself a special world
Far beyond the stars that shine
When you close your eyes tonight
Little boy, little girl
Waste no time as night time turns
Catch some moonlight in your hands
Take the wish the sandman sends
Little boy
Little girl, right upon the clouds unfurled
They'll take you off to Lorient
Where the story's just begun
Little boy
Little girl, ride the train to tomorrow's world
Find a dream to make come true
Hold it tight and bring it back with you
