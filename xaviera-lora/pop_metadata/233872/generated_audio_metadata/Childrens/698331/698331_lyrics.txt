Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
One, two, three, butterfly rock
One, two, three, butterfly rock
One, two, three, butterfly rock
I was only eight years old when I met some bold
Tiny little creatures in the sea
They smiled at me and we went underground to sea
Barrered stretcher and magic green rash
Grabbed my attention in a flash
Merman came along
Showed me blue pearls as I sang my song
We fly so high
One two three butterfly rock
One two three butterfly rock
One two three butterfly rock
Now all grown up I got asked to fix Steve
From a deadly frightening horrifying disease
His rays were brown his head dropped down well below his knees
I know I needed help and I dove in deep
But I came up looking pretty weak
I was only eight again
I need help from my friends
Who all swam in the ocean so deep
Round and round the island we search
Who can turn me back from a little sand witch?
We fly so high, hey hey
As much as he tried, no spell could unwind
The little person I was is inside
We had to call the power team of the yellow and black
Round they flew to bring me back
Butterfly rock, one two three
Butterfly rock, one two three
Butterfly rock, one two three
Butterfly rock
We fly so high
