Crisp morning air, orchard view
Baskets lined up, me and you
Red and gold and shining fair
We share laughter everywhere
Nimble steps among the trees
Swaying gently with the breeze
Apple crunch under the sky
Feels so good as time goes by
Apple Orchard Day, come along
Tasty sweetness keeps us strong
Every bite helps us belong
Apple Orchard Day, come along
Climbing up the wooden rail
Friends stay close, we never fail
Juicy scents drift in the air
Memories form without a care
Nimble steps among the trees
Swaying gently with the breeze
Apple crunch under the sky
Feels so good as time goes by
Apple orchard day, come along
Tasty sweetness keeps us strong
Every bite helps us belong
Apple orchard day, come along
As it's brimming at our feet
Heartfelt joy we'll always keep
