Come on up, it's not that tough
We can't, we can't, said the freighty ants
The come on up said try once more
While the freighty ants just said what for
The come-on-ups, they built a hill
They called it home, this hill they built
Their next-door neighbors, the freighty ants
Never marched or even danced
Come on up, it's not that tough
We can't, we can't, said the Freydians
The come on up said try once more
While the Freydians just said what for
Come on up
Come on up
While the come on ups learned to read and speak
The freighty ants grew dumb and weak
The come on ups marched through life
While the freighty ants got nothing right
Come on up, it's not that tough
We can't, we can't, said the freighty ants
The come on up said try once more
While the freighty ants just said what for
The come on ups reached the mountain tops
While the freighty ants made halfway stops
The freighty ants said it's hard to climb
Besides we're way too far behind
This song's about two kinds of ants
The come on ups and the frady ants
The come on ups went to school
While the frady ants were frady fools
School is school, it can be a tool
Unless and you're a frady fool
