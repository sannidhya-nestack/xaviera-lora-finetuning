Half a pound of tuppany rice
Half a pound of treacle
That's the way the money goes
Hop goes the weasel
Up and down the city roads
In and out the eagle
That's the way the money goes
Hop goes the weasel
Half a pound of tuppany rice
Half a pound of treacle
That's the way the money goes
Up goes the weasel
Every night when I go out
The weasel's on the table
Take a stick and knock it off
Hop goes the weasel
Half a pound of tapenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
That's the way the money goes
Hop goes the weasel
Up and down the city roads
In and out they go
That's the way the money goes
Hop goes the weasel
Half a pound of top anyways
Half a pound of treacle
That's the way the money goes
Hop goes the weasel
Every night when I go out
The weasel's on the table
Take a stick and knock it off
Hop goes the weasel
