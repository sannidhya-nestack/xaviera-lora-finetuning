Who put the frog in my lunchbox?
It's icky and sticky and green
It jumped from the box to my school books
A girl sitting next to me screamed
It sat on the floor for a minute
A spider it saw crossed the room
With a croak and a hop it pursued it
But the teacher discovered the broom
The spider it ran to the blackboard
The frog bounced and hopped round the floor
The girls all stood on the tables
The frog made a dash for the door
A cat at that moment was passing
The frog seemed a very nice snack
Rather than jumping to freedom
That amphibian came hopping back
The spider was running in circles
The frog jumped all over the room
The cat leapt after its dinner
And the teacher went whack with the broom
Destiny called to our froggy
It heard the croak of a toad
It leapt out the door in an instant
And bounced all the way down the road
Without looking left it just bolted
Not to get caught by the cat
The car never sawed it or hurt it
And poor little froggy went splat
Without looking left it just bolted
Not to get caught by that cat
The car never saw it or halted
And poor little froggy went splat
