Now let's hear some of those wild seafaring tales
My father was a sailor, he sailed the seven seas
But he suffered from an illness that made him always sneeze
So he kept a store of ankees for wiping his big fat nose
And when he put one to his face they all cried, "There she goes !"
Johnny Johnny Roger, flying in the breeze
Hail to the pirate flag flying high over the great blue briny seas
Rowena, what about that one about Agnes?
Now Agnes was a milkmaid
She tended to the cows
She had an awful temper
And she entered many rows
But one day while a-milking
She shouted at the beast
The cow jumped up right on top of her and now she is deceased!
Oh no! Oh dear! Ah!'Tis awful!
Jolly, Jolly Roger
Flying in the breeze
Hail to the pirate flag flying high in the red, blue, grimy seas
And then there was that one about poor old Charlie
Now Charlie, he was an angel, the nicest of them all
He flew across the sky, he did, and he blew the trumpet call
To summon all the angels by giving the battle cry
For the devil himself was a-coming, it was good old Captain Blithe
Jolly Jolly Roger, flying in the breeze
Hail to the pirate flag flying high on the red moon brighting seas
Jolly Jolly Roger, flying in the breeze
Hail to the pirate flag flying high on the red moon brighting seas
