Oh give me a home where the buffalo roam
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
Home, home on the range
Where the deer in the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
Oh give me a home where dinosaurs still roam
Pteranodons fly through the air
We'll ask them for rides and we'll fly through the skies
Looking down on the buffalo below
Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
Often at night when the stars are so bright
With the light from our campfire below
Find a good stick to roast marshmallows is the trick
S'mores for you and me
Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy or bare
Oh, I would not exchange my home on the range
With a deer in the antelope plain
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
Home, home on the range
Where the deer in the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
