Oh, Cayman Moon
Shining down from above
Shine out tonight
On the one I love
And by your beam
I'll have love dream
Shine out tonight
Old Cayman moon
And the stars above
With you, keep shining, shining tonight
On the one that I love
And in your beat
I'll hum love tunes
Shine out tonight
Oh, Cayman Moon
O Cayman moon, shine out so bright
Wrap in the gloom in your halo of light
And by your beam
You'll make one swoon
Shine out tonight
Old Cayman moon
And the stars above
With you keep shining, shining tonight
On the one that I love
And in your beat
I'll hum love tunes, shine out tonight
Oh, Cayman Moon, oh, Cayman Moon
