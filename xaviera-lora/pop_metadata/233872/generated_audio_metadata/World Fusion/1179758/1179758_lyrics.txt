It's not an easy road to travel
Lots of temptations and obstacles
Many don't like us or what we stand for
Society and family, they fight against us
We give praises to the most high
Praise him in songs and music
Sometimes we're burning with fire
Hitting out against the system
Now we have seen the light (seen the light)
And we live the life (live the life)
Bearing reproaches of Christ
Now a new day is dawn (new day is dawn)
And a new man is born (new man is born)
Take up the cross and follow Christ
We don't absorb western corruption
Looking to the east we'll found our king
Emperor Selassie I, King of Kings
Conquering Lion of Judah
Rastafari guides and protects us
As we exalt his name
So we speak plainly and boldly
And Yahweh bless us abundantly
Now we have seen the light
And we live the life
Bearing reproaches of Christ
Now a new day is dawn
And a new man is born
Take up the cross and follow Christ
Now we have seen the light
And we live the life
Bearing reproaches of Christ
Now a new day is dawn
And a new man is born
Take up the cross and follow Christ
We have seen the light
Now we live the life
Bearing reproaches of Christ
Now a new day is dawn
And a new man is born
Take up the cross and follow Christ
We have seen the light (seen the light)
Live the life (live the life) yeah, yeah, yeah
Bury with branches of Christ
A new day is dawn (a new day is dawn)
A new man is born (a new man is born)
Take up the cross and follow Christ
