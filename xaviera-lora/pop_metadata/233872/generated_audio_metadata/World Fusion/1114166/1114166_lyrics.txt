Slept on a Friday
Me and my G's woke up to a new life
Just the next day
It was a sunny day
Twenty-thirteen now is a long way back
Long way back
(It is you on the track)
Started skipping class for this music
Started losing friends for this music
Started acting lonely for this music
Many people thought I was crazy for this music
Started getting money, fella started acting funny
For money
Used to dare a lot of tricks that never had an ending
Oh not done it
Now they want gun body, they want gun body to the wrong body oh
Back when I be nobody, when I be nobody you no gun body oh
Because if you don't know me when I be nobody then I no know you oh
But say we the wrong body when I be nobody you be my bestie oh
It's like that but the wrong way
Zaga, nah, is it like that I go one way
Zaga
Old things have passed away
Good things have fallen on the real nigga
If you the hater, no blame you now
Jah bless us all, we go home and come
We go home and come
Started getting cash in the music
Started spending cash on the music
Started running tails on the low low
Started getting paid on the low now
Nah mean they bust the medulla
Nah mean they talk bout the count down now
Nah mean yuh dress up they talk about
Love, ah, nah
Nah mean they post they made to laugh
Nah mean they talk bout the kandana
Nah mean yuh guess what they talk about
But now they want gun body
They want gun body to the wrong body oh
Back when I be nobody
When I be nobody you no gun body oh
Because if you don't know me when I be nobody
Then I no know you oh
But say we the wrong body
When I be nobody you be my best yo
This like a battle wound
Zaga, oh Lord, is it like that I go away? Zaga, is it like that I go away?
Na mi dey boss dey medula
Na mi dey top on di kandana
Na mi yoke seh dey talk about
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love
