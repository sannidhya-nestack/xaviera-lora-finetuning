My baby's back in town, I will never let him down
He's the greatest lover, he doesn't like no other
He has got the magic voice, mysterious and curious
He is the best choice, he's got the best voice
Dance, you can tap, you can do it to the end
Move your feet to the beat, you can do it till it peaks
When I look into your eyes I could absolutely die just because I am happy
Dance, you can jump, you can do it to the end
Move your feet to the beat, you can do it'til it peaks
Do-dub-de-dub-de-dub-de-dub-de-dub-de-dub-de-dub-de-dub-de-dub-de-dub-de-dub-de-dub-de-dub-de-dub-de-dub
Move my babies back in town, I will never let'em down
He's the greatest lover, he does it like no other
He has got the magic voice, mysterious and curious
He is the best choice, he's got the best voice
Doo-da-be-dee-da-be-day
Doo-da-be-dee-da
Doo-da-be-dee-da
Doo-da-be-dee-da be day
Doo-da-be-dee-da
Did I fall in love before? I don't know this anymore
Just because you make me happy
That is you can jump, you can do it to the end
Move your feet to the beat, you can do it till it peaks
That is you can jump, you can do it till the end
Move your feet to the beat, you can do it till it peaks
Do da ba dee da ba die
Do da ba dee da ba die
Do da ba dee da ba die
Do da ba dee da ba die
