Feeling sun and ocean breeze
Staring lazy at the water (water, water)
Dreaming days and stealing ways
Never get enough (never get enough)
Hallows when the day is dawning
Freshen you with every morning
Walkin' on seven-mile beach
Mellow minds and mellow moods
Heart and soul in tune
Skin as golden as the sunset
Loveful as the moon
Any time of day is fine
Don't pay no mind don't care for time
Hand in your hand in mine
Walking on seven mile beach
I never want these days to end
I just wanna take you there
Any time of day is fine
Don't pay no mind, don't care for time
Hand in your hand in mine
Walking on seven mile beach
Walking on seven mile beach
Yeah, on seven mile beach
God that drummin' sound good, that drummin' sound
Brr-r-r-r-p-t-p-t-p-t-p-p-p-p-t-p
To the beat of my drum, man that drummin' sound sweet
Can't hope I don't go in trans, happen sight here
Rumi la jileb, gungu bereya
