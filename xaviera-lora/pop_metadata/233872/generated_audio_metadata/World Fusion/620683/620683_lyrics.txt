One day I will find my way, I don't know when
All I know is that I'll find it, my friend
One day I will fly to the moon
It's gonna be so soon
Maybe May, July, September or June
I just need someone to say it's all okay
Yes, I just need someone to say it's all okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I will pass the bricks and the walls
I'm gonna pass it all
I don't care how big, I don't care how small
One day I will find my way
But I don't know when
All I know is that I'll find it my friend
And I just need someone to say it's all okay
Yes I just need someone to say it's all okay
I'm not okay
Not okay
(You're too good to be true)
