So all the time you want to say what you mean when you say hello
To make a fool of the scene when you're trying to make it so
She fell in love with the photograph
Just like a fool who believes in that
Never pretend that you're right when everything you try to say is falling away
And you want and you need to be right when you know you're wrong
It's only fear that you feel when you're trying to keep it strong
She fell in love with an engine
You should have known you'd been there before
Never pretend that you're wrong when everything you try to do is going so wrong
There was a time you were young, all you had to do was say hello
But on this time it goes on and your attitude won't change it's soul
She fell in love with a phantom dream
And what you have is another scheme
You never learn'cause you know that
Everything you knew you could have fell away so
She fell in love with a photograph
Just like a fool who believes that
Never pretend that you're right when
Everything you try to say is falling away
Oh, got my time, got my time
It's everything you know best, having your way
