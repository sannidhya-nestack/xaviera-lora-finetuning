They all see those eyes
In the night they glow
History inside
Don't let it go
You look my way
Heart beats so fast
In your gaze I stay
Hope this lasts
Intriguing eyes, they mesmerize
Can't deny, got me high
Whispers in the air, feel you near
In your stare, disappear
Hold on tight, through the night
With your light, all feels right
Intriguing eyes, they mesmerize
Can't deny, got me high
You look my way
Heart beats so fast
In your gaze I stay
Hope this lasts
Intriguing eyes that mesmerize
Can't deny, climb me high
Oh, oh
Whispers in the air
Fill you near
In your stare
Disappear
Hold on tight
Through the night
With your light
All feels right
Intriguing eyes, they mesmerize
Can't deny, got me high
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
