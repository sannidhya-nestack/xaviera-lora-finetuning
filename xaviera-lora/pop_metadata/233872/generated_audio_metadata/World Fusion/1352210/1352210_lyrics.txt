Angels of mercy have come before the dawn
To awaken the people with a song
We'll end the tempest, be chared of hate
'Cause we fall under Satan's own freeway
Angels of mercy have come before the dawn
To tell all the people it won't be long
Angels of mercy have come before the dawn
To awaken the people with a song
We'll end the tempest each end of hell
To be found under Satan's own greedy way
Angels of mercy have come before the dawn
To tell other people it won't be long
To tell other people it won't be long
Angels of mercy have come before the dawn
Tell other people it won't be long
