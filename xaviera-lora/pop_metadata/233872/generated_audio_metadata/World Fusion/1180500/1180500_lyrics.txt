Come Rasta man, come beat the KT drum, we now stop chanting the song out loud, aya we a go fire burn the wicked dem now, chant we a go chant dem down
Say you oppress and we can't take it no more
Sucking from the poor with your evil sustains
Your hissing and kissing's serious thing
Shantriya go chant them down

Plains in Lake Foya the workers say they must go down
Trouble Jah Jah children but they can't keep us down
No way
Shantriya go chant them down
They come and fool you up with one bag of lies
Making promises that they can't fulfill
Use they come to use, they come to abuse
Shantriya go chant them down
As you turn your back they laugh at you
Ragging and boasting how much they control you
The big people's wits that is all they do
Shantriya go chant them down
Shantriya go chant them down
Iniquity work and say they must go down
Double-downed our children but they can't keep us down
No way
Shantriya go chant them down

And give praise to Jah for all you wrote (Praise Jah, praise Jah)
Shanti Akoh Shantindam (Wah)
Nema Nema Nema Nema Nema (Say words, sound and power)
Hit them with music
And seeks them with the treatment but they can't escape
Cause the burning fire I go burn them out
Burn them out, burn them down, burn them down, burn them down, burn them down, burn them down, burn them down
