Yesterday you count my cold
Yesterday you shone like gold
Didn't see nothing leave with you
Nothing but my traded soul
It counted me out of paradise
It counted me for twice the pain
There ain't one thing I would not beg
To count on you for my blue sky
Twice and half the price I'll beg
I can't afford but one more try
It's way too much to give away
Watch you sell off with no alibi in
Yesterday you count my code
Love and sweat and whispering
You take back all I took from you
All the happy happy songs we'd sing
Many many nights have gone
You couldn't wait but a month or two
Without a hint of sadness song
Until you came back to count your coup
Won't you take some more offhand advice
Before I fade away to sky
Tell them one more thing for me
You tell them not to even try
Won't you take some more offhand advice
You know the heavy handed times are wrong
You've been counting goo for twice
Still you have to carry on
You're counting me out of paradise
You're counting me in for twice the pain
I would not beg for such a price
Just to count on you for one sweet day
No, I would not beg for such a prize
Just to count on you for one sweet day
Can't afford more price to pay
To count on you for one sweet day
