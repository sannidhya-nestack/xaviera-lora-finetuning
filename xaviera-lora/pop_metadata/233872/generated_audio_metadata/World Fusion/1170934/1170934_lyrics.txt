We will be bonnie and saddles up
And I'll give the gong, gong, gong, gong
We will be bonnie and saddles up
And I'll give the gong, gong gong, gong
I'm not the one you're looking for
I'm not the one you're looking for
I'm not the one you're looking for
I'm not the one you're looking for
They will be bonnie and sadder some
They call you the gong, gong, gong, gong
They will be bonnie and sadder some
They call you the gong, gong, gong, gong
They will be bonnie and sadder some
They call you the gong, gong, gong, gong
They will be bonnie and sadder some
They call you the gong, gong, gong, gong
Oh, oh, oh, oh
