Think of me and I'll be there
I'll be there to heal you
Think of me and I'll be there
I'll be there to feel you
When the wind is blowing
From the day in and on
When your heart is yearning
When you dream of home
Think of me and I'll be there
I'll be there to heal you
Think of me and I'll be there
I'll be there to feel you
Think of me when the sun stops shining
Think of me when the lightning strikes
I am here as the breath you're breathing
Think of me, I'll be by your side
Think of me and I'll be there
I'll be there to heal you, sing of me and I'll be there
I'll be there to feel you, I'll be there to feel you
I'll be there to feel you
Think of me and I'll be there
I'll be there to heal you
Think of me and I'll be there
I'll be there to feel you
When the wind is blowing
When the day is long
When your heart is yearning
In your dream of home
Think of me and I'll be there
I'll be there to heal you
Think of me and I'll be there
I'll be there to feel you
Think of me when the sun stops shining
Think of me when the lightning strikes
I am here as the breath you're breathing
Think of me I'll be by your side
Think of me and I'll be there
I'll be there to heal you
Think of me and I'll be there
I'll be there to heal you
I'll be there to heal you
I'll be there to heal you
