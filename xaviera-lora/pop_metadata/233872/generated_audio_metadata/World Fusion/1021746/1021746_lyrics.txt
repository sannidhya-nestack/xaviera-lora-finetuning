Have you ever met someone
Who took your breath away
Have you ever met someone
You thought of night and day
I can feel you deep in my heart
I can taste your soft skin
I long to hold you, long to touch you
And you know where my desire begins
Oh, I'm under your spell
Oh, you know where to when
Oh, I'm under your spell
Oh, I'm under your spell
Nails across my back
Love's razor sharp pleasure
Heal the wounds of the past with this soul of beyond measure
I am lost in love, I am lost in your heat
And I feel you to my core
Here to finish what we started life times before
Oh, I'm under your spell
Oh, you know where to when
Oh, I'm under your spell
Oh, I'm under your spell
I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job, I need I have a job,
Why is so young and my heart
I am so young and I'm a fool
I am who's name when we fall
