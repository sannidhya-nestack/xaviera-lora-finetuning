Fire, fire, fire, fire
Stepping out the place with the hot sauce
Looking so fresh how I hot shot
Looking from afar take a top shot
Girls looking dapper with the bomb shots
Too fly like a G6
Shit too real like the matrix
Move like Jag I can't touch this
Dope shot like I'm Deathshot
Ice-y and red get to mix up
Money know the finish you see your part
Making all the ladies want say oh gosh
Bartender
Two shots, give me two shots
Drink some me, give me two more
Any yam bakari with the mixture
Ready set cheese, take a picture
Two shots, give me two shots
Drink some me, give me two more
Any yam bakari with the mixture
Ready set cheese, take a picture
I do a night for club (club)
Everyone is having fun (fun)
Babes wearing sparkly tops
Cock brush champagne everything they pop
DJ with the nicest hair
Smoking off weed just to feel the air
My body is a trigger, trigger
I like so what and I'm fire, fire
Fire, fire
I tell you tell, I flickers and flash
People they dance, you come they chat
Music so loud, dollars and pounds
Bartender, two shots, give me two shots
Drink some me, give me two more
And a young bacardi with a mixed draft
Ready set cheese take a picture
Two shots give me two shots
Drink some me give me two more
Any avocado what a mixture
Ready set cheese take a picture
Too fly like a G6
Shit too real like the matrix
Move like Jaguar can't touch this
Tough shot like I'm death shot
Bad girl baby wanna control that
Shake that booty make her control that
Bad girl take the controller
Let her booty bounce girl control that
Bad girl baby wanna control that
Shake that booty make her control that
Bad girl take the controller
Let her booty bounce girl control that
Bartender
Two shots give me two shots
Drink some me give me two more
And the Yamba Caddy with the mixture
Ready set cheese, take a picture, ah
Two shots, give me two shots
Drink some, give me two more
Any yamba, party, body mixture
Ready set cheese, take a picture, picture, ah
Fire, fire, fire, fire (you're done now)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
