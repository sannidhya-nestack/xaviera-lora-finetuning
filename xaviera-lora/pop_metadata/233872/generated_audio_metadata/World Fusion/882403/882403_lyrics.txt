Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
There's a place by the park
Where all their children play
And their innocence
Reminded me of her yesterday
Her smile, her grace
The way that she laughs
I miss her
She's beautiful, there must be a part that I can choose
I can choose
The park was cold and when it rained
I was in a play without an actor
But there's a part of me
That wants to get back to
Her smile, her face, the way that she laughs
I miss her, she's beautiful
I want her to walk back to me
Back to me
In my dreams I kiss you softly now
Borne on by hope of some distant time
I'm a man and I must keep my vow
To keep the picture in my mind
I want her to walk back to me
Please walk back to me
The park was cold and it rained like a plea
Without an actor and there's a part of me
That wants to get back to her smile
Her face, the way that she laughs
I miss her, she's beautiful
There must be a path that I can choose
I can't choose
I dream you kiss me softly now (softly now)
Bored I'm by hope of some distant time
'Cause I'm a man and I must keep my vow
Softly now
To keep the picture in my mind
I want her to walk back to me
Please walk back to me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Me, me, me, yeah, me, me, yeah, me
