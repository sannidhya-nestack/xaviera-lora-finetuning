I live my life like a superstar
On the stage, slide me my guitar
Girl, the way you are, I love
The way you are
Think I was over here
Thought you were the only one that I breathe
I don't mind this hell of a league
Thought I'd seen friends like new enemies
You and I
Mmm, only you and I
Mmm, you and I, you and I, only you and I
You and I, girl, yeah
You and I, honey, by the lakeside, lakeside
Then you show me the south, got a sign
You and I, girl, yeah
You and I
Push your hands up like a dance pony that you, you
Party don't stop, every party'til the morning, morning, yeah
Started from the couch to the bed night flow
Bring nobody close, baby give me some more
Just wanna make love, baby I don't want more, no
Oh, live my life like a superstar
On the stage, slide me my guitar
Girl, the way you are, I love
The way you are, feel like I was over here
Thought you were the only one that I breathe
I know my heart's had a leak
Thought I seen friends, thought I knew enemies
You and I, you and I, only you and I
Don't play no game, another name
You're no good liar, you're my desire
Don't I require you?
Don't I require you?
I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'll die, I'll die, I'll die, I'll die, I'll die, I'll die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die
Body, body, untouch your body
Body, body, don't tell nobody
Body, body, untouch your body
Body, body, don't tell nobody
Touch your body for you, yeah
I live my life like a superstar
On the stage, slide me my guitar
Girl, the way you are
I love the way you are
Big house over here
Girl, you're the only one that I breathe
I don't mind, just head on me
Girl, I seen friends turn to enemies
You and I, only you and I
You and I, you and I, only you and I
