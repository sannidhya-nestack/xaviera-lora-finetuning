Sing praises
To the Almighty One
Whenever problems get you down
And you don't know where to turn
You can call upon His name
And He will take care of you
He is so mighty, He is so strong
He will guide and protect you
Don't worry my friend
You can call upon his name
Jah give me strength
That I will never give up now
Jah give me strength
That I will carry on
Jah give me strength
That I will never give up now
Jah give me strength
That I will carry on
See, just seek Him from within
Seek Him with all your heart
So He will hear your voice
And deliver you from bondage
He is so merciful and kind
He will guide and protect you
He is the father of the world
And he so loves his children
O Jah
Jah Jah
Give me strength now
Give me strength now
Jah Jah
Give me strength now
Give me strength now
Sing you a song
Sing you a song
Sing you a song of phrases
Sing you a song, sing you a song
Give praises to the almighty one
Jah give me strength
That I will never give up now
Jah give me strength that I will carry on
Jah give me strength that I will never give up
