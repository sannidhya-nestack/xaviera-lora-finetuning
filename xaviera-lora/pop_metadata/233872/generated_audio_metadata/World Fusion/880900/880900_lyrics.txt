It's JoJo7
Oh yeah
Lada, yeah yeah
Somebody, somebody
I got an emergency
Somebody call the doctor for me
I need a remedy
Put this music inside of me
I feeling it in my bones
All up in my hormones
The music making me crazy
Somebody help me
It hard, it hard
It got me going down to the ground
All funny ground
All over my head
I'm whining and I'm grinding and I'm feeling like I'm going mad
For love
I want some medicine to cure me now, oh yeah
My head, my head is just going round and round (my head, my head, my head) yeah
I got an emergency, somebody call the doctor for me
I need a remedy, for this music inside of me
I'm feeling it in my bones, all up in my heart mode
The music making me go
Crazy, somebody help me, it hard, it hard
They got me going down to the ground, all for the ground, all for my head
I'm whining and I'm grinding and I'm feeling like I'm getting mad
Call the doctor, call the police, call the ambulance, the music got me in a trance
Call the doctor, call the police, call the ambulance
The music got me going mad
I want some medicine to cure me now
My head, my head is just going round and round
Yeah, I got an emergency
Somebody call the doctor for me
I need a remedy
For this music inside of me
I'm feeling it in my bones
All up in my hormones
The music making me crazy
Somebody help me
It hard, it hard
It got me going down to the ground
All down the ground, all over my head
I'm whining and I'm grinding and I'm feeling like I'm mad
