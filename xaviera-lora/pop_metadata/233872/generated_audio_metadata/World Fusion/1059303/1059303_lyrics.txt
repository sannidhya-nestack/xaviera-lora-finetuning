'Cause I could be as cool as you want me to be
And as hot as you need for me, oh baby
Oh baby,'cause I can be as cool as you want me to be
And as hot as you need for me, oh baby
Oh baby
Right ya know
Things weh go happen a go happen no more
Bishop done said
Dey go rip through de door
Maximizing ma future making everything sure
Take time fi read a must take time fi look
Straighten up ma flaws overhauling ma book
Leaving ma ripples and setting ma gates
So de trackband me record is certainly clear
But de future's coming up I swear
Is I can be at food
As you want me to be
And that's as hot as the league for me
Oh baby, oh baby
I can be as cool as you want me to be
And that's as hot as the league for me
Oh baby, oh baby
Oh baby
Man have to tell them to cease
Circle
Take time with ease
Put a space in between
I'm warning you please
I'm spiralling up like an infectious disease
But don't you misunderstand my nature
I am cool, smooth, easy going
Nice personality
Light heart within
But have to keep a close watch
On the game they're playing
So when they make the face and even try to start something
I could be cool like the one better be
And that's how it's a lead for me
Oh baby, oh baby
I can be cool as you want me to be
And that's how it's a lead for me
Oh baby
One more time, things we go happen a go happen no more
Bishop done set, we go rip through the door
Maximizing my future making everything sure
Take time fi read a must take time fi look
Straighten up my flaws overhauling my book
Leaving my ripples and setting my gear
So the track pan me record is certainly clear
For the future's coming up I swear
If I could be cool like the one better be
And it's hot, it's a need for me, oh baby, oh baby
I could be cool like you want me to be
And it's hot, it's a need for me, oh baby, oh baby
So I can be cool, and it's hot
Oh baby, oh baby
So I can be cool
And let's start
Oh baby, oh baby
