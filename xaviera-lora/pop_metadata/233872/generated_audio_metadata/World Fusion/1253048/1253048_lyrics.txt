Saw her dancing in your lights
Glowing colours making magic bright
She's a queen in every way
Sunset dreams in the day
Spinning in a world of sound
Her moves shake the ground
Mystic vibes and electric feel
When spoken words they heal
It's like diva in the night
Causing flames, taking flight
Lost in rhythm, kill the light
It's like diva shining bright
Her eyes with the secrets deep
Promises she loves to keep
Mr. Rhythm pure delight
Each moment makes you sure
Of the rhythm heartbeat sounds
In her glow you're found
A lure you can't ignore
Watching more and more
It's Holly, diva in the night
Glowing colours making magic bright
She's a queen in every way
Sunset dreams in the day
Spinning in a world of sound
Her moves shake the ground
Mystic vibes and electric feel
Unspoken words they heal
It's Holly, diva in the night
Dancing flames taking flight
Lost in rhythm, pure delight
Excited, but shining bright
Her eyes with the secrets deep
Promises she loves to keep
Mr. Rhythm pure delight
Each moment makes you sure
Call the rhythm heartbeat sounds
In her glow you're found
Her lure you can't ignore
Wanting more and more
Exotic diva in the night
