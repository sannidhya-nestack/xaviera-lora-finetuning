So pipe your fista
Quicker than the twister
If you have a sister
You ain't gonna miss her
Do it for yourself
Do it for yourself
Do it for yourself
Suburban landscapes, indoctrinated hate
You greedy, ingrate, you will never relate
Again, again
I just want to hear the river flow
You just need to take it slow
I came down to the river
I just need to hear the
Sometimes it brings all the things that pull the strings like diamond rings
Baby I got to give it what not to live it what not to be it
But I must have lost my way again let us stray again the cliche my friend
I just need to see the river
I just need to see the river
I just want to hear the
I just need to see the river yeah yeah
I just need to hear the
I just need to see the river
Sometimes it brings all the things that pull me straight
It's like diamond rings (I just need to hear the)
Maybe I got to give and what not to live with (I just need to see the river)
I must have lost my way again, let it stray again (I just want to hear the)
I just need to see the river
I just want to hither
Sometimes it brings all the things that pull me straight
And sometimes I'm a wreck (I just need to see the river)
They act not to give and what not to live and what not to fear (I just want to hither)
But I must have lost my way again and let it stray again (I just need to see the river)
I just need to see the river (I just want to hither)
