Now life has no color
Surrounded by love
Beauty is mystical
Alive inside of us
A light of purity
An innocent heart
Nowhere is that reality
So reach out
Reach on up
So reach out
That will shine for the world to see
So reach out
That will shine for the world to see
So reach out
That will shine for the world to see
Beauty is the light
Deep inside your heart
Don't you hear it calling
Mystical beauty
Mmm, yeah
Now life has no color
Surrounded by love
Beauty is mystical
A lot inside of us
A light of purity
An innocent cause
No worries about fatality
So reach out
Reach all out
So reach out
That will shine for the world to see
So reach out
Reach on up
So reach out
That will shine for the world to see
So reach out
That will shine for the world to see
So reach out
That will shine for the world to see
So reach out
Reach out
Reach out
That will shine for the world to see
