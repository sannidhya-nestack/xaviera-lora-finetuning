Queridos amigos de la América Latina
De mi tierra y de mi raza
Habla Carlos Gardel
Estoy ahora en los estudios Victor de Nueva York
Registrando las canciones del día que me quieras
La película que quiero de todo corazón
Y que dedico a los amigos de España y de la América Latina
Sailing my mind away
Drifting alone like a castaway
My heart is cold as ice
Longing that you hold me in your eyes
You won't save my soul
Even if you want to watch me fall
But this song belongs to me
A note at a time, it's a piece of me
Why are you calling me now?
That give me whispers
Bringing me solace as a scenic alone
You cannot take me away
Throw about my love and fate
You can only own my waist
Darling, darling, darling, darling
Running, running, running, running
Coming, coming, coming, coming to me
Why are you calling me now?
Give me whispers
Bring on me solace
As I see me come along
You cannot take me away
Know about my love and faith
You can only own my waist
Sailing by the modern way
Drifting alone like a castaway
iving all I used to be
So baby please come back to me
Oh, oh, oh, oh
