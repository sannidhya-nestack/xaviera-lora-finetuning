As I'm running through, running through
This jungle I see faces
I'm looking back at you, back at you
But you won't stop chasing
Don't make me look back no more
No more review minutes here
I'm about to fall if I run through
All these barriers
Don't make me look bad no more
Try to make me fall down
Don't make me look bad no more
No real humor is here
I'm'bout to fall if I run through
(I'm alive)
As I'm running through, running through
This jungle I see faces
I'm looking back at you, back at you
But you won't stop chasing
Don't make me look back no more
No more review minutes here
I'm about to fall if I run through
All these barriers
Don't make me look bad no more
Try to make me fall, yeah
Don't make me look bad no more
No real humor is here
I'm'bout to fall if I run through
Tryna make me fall, yeah
Don't make me look bad no more
No rear view mirrors here
I'm'bout to fall if I run through
