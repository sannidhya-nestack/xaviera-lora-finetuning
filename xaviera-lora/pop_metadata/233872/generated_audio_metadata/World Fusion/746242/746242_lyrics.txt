This could be amazing
You know what I'm saying
On a high, I could burst, I'm delirious
This could be the best thing
The greatest ever feeling
On a high, I could burst, I'm delirious
Stand up, baby, get in the photo
Stand up, baby, get in the photo
Stand up, baby, get in the photo
Stand up, baby, get in the photo
Stand up, baby, get in the photo
Stand up, baby, get in the photo
Stand up, baby, get in the photo
Stand up, baby, get in the photo
It's incredible
Feels so wonderful
Blown away in a state of bliss
Let's create the mood
Making headline news
You and me
Reaching for the pitch
In a flash of light
You were by my side
Then you take my hand
And we start to dance
Head up in the clouds
Moving to the sound
When the rhythm sits right up in the mix
And the music plays pounding in your face
We could make this night the best night of our lives
This could be amazing
You know what I'm saying
On a high I could burst
I'm delirious
This could be the best thing
The greatest ever feeling
On a high, I could burst, I'm delirious (I'm delirious)
Star not beating in a photo
Star not beating in a photo
Starlight be the end of the world
Starlight be the end of the world
Starlight be the end of the world (You just gotta face the past)
Starlight be the end of the world (Oh)
Starlight be the end of the world
Starlight be the end of the world (I can't live without you)
Starlight be the end of the world (Oh)
Starlight be the end of the world
This could be amazing (It's amazing)
If you know what I'm sayin' (oh)
On a high, I could burst, I'm delirious (delirious, oh yeah)
This could be the best thing (this could be the best thing)
The greatest ever feelin' (yeah, yeah, oh)
On a high, I could burst, I'm delirious (oh no, oh no)
