I've stumbled, I've fallen down, made mistakes
For the crown
Not perfect, never clean
But I've learned, I've changed my name
I ive myself, I let it go
I've grown through pain, I've learned to show
I'm only me, I've got my flaws
I've learned to love, I've earned my cause
I've cried out hurt, but now I see
I'm free to be
I'm only me
I've hurt some hearts along the way
Regrets I carry night and day but I'm wiser
I've learned to mend
I know the power of love to lend
I ive myself, I let it go
I've grown through pain, I've learned to show
I'm only me, I've got my flaws
I've learned to love, I've earned my cut
I've cried, I've hurt, but now I see
I'm free to be
I'm only me
The world may judge but I stand tall
I rise again I conquer all
With gentle heart I find my way
I'm stronger now
Come with me
I'm only me
I'm only me
I've got my flow
I'm on my flow
I've learned to love
I've learned to love
I've earned my call
I've earned my call
I've heard, I've heard
I've heard, I've heard
But now I see
But now I see
I'm free
I'm only me
I'm only me
