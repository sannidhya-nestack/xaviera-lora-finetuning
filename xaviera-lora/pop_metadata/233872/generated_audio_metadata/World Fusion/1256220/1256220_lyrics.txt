Yeah
In the morning light
You call my name
Your smile so bright
Feels like a flame
Every beat we share
Dances in my chest
Fingers through your hair
You are the best
Oh my matter my life
You erase all the strife
With you by my side
It's a beautiful ride
When the night falls deep, we sway so slow
Into dreams we creep, love starts to grow
In your eyes so clear, I see my world
When you're near, no fear, future's unfurled
Oh my matter, my life, you erase all strife
With you by my side, it's beautiful right
When the night falls deep, we sway so slow
Into dreams we creep, love starts to grow
In your eyes so clear, I see my world
When you're near, no fear, futures unfurled
Oh my matter, my life, you erase all the strife
With you by my side, it's a beautiful ride
