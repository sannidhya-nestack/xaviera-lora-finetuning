It's your dance, it's your life, it's your boogie
Live your own life, do the boogie of your soul
It's your dance, it's your life, it's your boogie
Dance with your life, step out, step out, be bold
When you step out, your vision unfolds
You move with precision from the depths of your soul
When you are bold, your life free flows
A chance for romance, a chance for the spirit to dance
It's your dance, it's your life, it's your boogie
Live your own life to the boogie of your soul
It's your dance, it's your life, it's your boogie
Dance with your life, take the steps
Be the vision in your heart
It's your dance, it's your boogie, it's your life
Take the steps, it's your dance, it's your boogie, it's your life
Take the steps, it's your boogie, it's your life
