Stand up for love
Spirit above
Open up our hearts somehow
The world is filled with strife
Still we must hold on strong
Help us to see the light
And find where we belong
We all feel me
Hunger that earth cannot build
Your love can feed
And your touch can grace us still
This is my solemn prayer
This is my heart's true song
Let love shine everywhere
That's where love belongs
