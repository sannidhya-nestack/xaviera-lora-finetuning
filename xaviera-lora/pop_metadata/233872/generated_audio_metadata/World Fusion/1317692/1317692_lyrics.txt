Rainbow under red
Yellow and green color
We are
The rainbow under red
Yellow and green color
We are
Tied up in Selassie high teaching
We're Rasta Nation without no boundary
Rasta Nation all over without boundary
In one love we struggle for peace and love
One Jah, one people, one destiny
One Jah, one people, one destiny
We are on the red, natty red
Rainbow on the red, yellow and green color
We are the rainbow on the
Red, yellow and green color we are
Yes, c'est de la, c'est de la Marley
Bob Marley's philosophy floats in our head
And its melody vibrates our lips
This grace to Babylon's philosophy
'Cause people, our people are coming together
As Rasta Nation
Disgrace to Babylon politic
'Cause our people, sweet people
Are coming together as Rasta Nation
Rainbow on the red, yellow and green color
We are
The people on the red, yellow and green colour
Why not reggae in this world?
It's I and I
Why not Reggae? It's our struggle
Babylon is rising against wisdom
And them shall fall
Fooling people, they are fooling themselves
Take your spliff, reggae is an over spliff
Take your spliff, dancehall music is an over spliff
I know Jah never lay down Africa
I and I say wake up Rastaman
I and I say awake Zion
Do you think that's right?
Brother killing brother
Sisters with bombs
Children with machine guns
Awake Zion
Awake black man
Awake bongo man
I say Awake, Congo man
Awake, my sweet Zion
Awake, Rasta man
