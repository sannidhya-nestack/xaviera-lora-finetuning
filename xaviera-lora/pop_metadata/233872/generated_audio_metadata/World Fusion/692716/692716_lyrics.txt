Boys expect to tangle with the wishes in their hand
Make sure to play their favorite song or they begin to stare
All dressed for syncopation, they can boogie'til they're song'd
They always take their shoes off, they leave'em by the door
And then they're blasted by the time it takes to even up the glass
They look like Jackson Pollock when they fall down on their ass
All the women do the talking as the band begins to play
And my jacket starts to talk to me again, again
It's Friday night and bleary-eyed, they're drunk before they start
Chance and Tarantella tell the secrets of their heart
Meet you out in Carvels Park now don't you tell a soul
I've got myself a blanket, a toothbrush and a towel
I'll bring along a bone for dark set bayin' at the moon
And hang around your pretty neck that little silver spoon
The chains around your ankles I promise to set free
You can lie down on my blanket and then do the same for me
In the cafe you can join the queue
There's been a rush on bean curd stew
Hey look at Jack without his head
His shoes on fire in the chicken shed
Our flyweight Jack ain't got no breath
His jacket's on fire and his donkey's dead
It's all that jazz and tarantella instead of the blues
Jazz and Tarantella instead of the blues
Jazz and Tarantella instead of the blues
Friday night, bleary-eyed, drunk before they start
Dancing Tarantella, tell the secrets of their heart
Meet you out in Carvelous Park, now don't you tell a soul
I've got myself a blanket, a toothbrush and a roll
I'm gonna bring along a bone for dogs that bayin' at the moon
Hang around your pretty neck that little silver spoon
The chains around your ankles I promise to set free
Lie down on my blanket and I'll do the same for you and me
In the cafe you can join the queue
There's been a rush on being cut through
Hey look at Jack without his head
His shoes on fire and a chicken shed
Flyaway Jack ain't got no breath
His jacket's on fire and his donkey's still
It's all that jazz and tarantella instead of the blues
Jazz and tarantella instead of the blues
Jazz and tarantella instead of the blues
Jazz and tarantella
Jazz and tarantella
Trans and Tarantella
