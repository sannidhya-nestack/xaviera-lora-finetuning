A gypsy told me fortune telling
My future love life I'd see
Written in the moon and stars
In the cards
Venus would align with Mars
Time to let down my guard
Capricorn rising
Saturn ruled
Won't be fooled
Zodiac lovers let go in love
Serious hearts are deep
Always in search of moon struck romance
For keeps safe and secure
Zodiac lovers
Mysteries unfold
True love is found
Just as the gypsy foretold
Cosmic journey through time
Best of all
Oh, straight up to the top we climb
Clear as a crystal ball
We were meant to be
Forever stay life the way
Zodiac lovers, let go in love
Serious hearts are deep
Always in search of moons to roam my lands
For keeps safe and secure
Zodiac lovers
Moon and sun signs
Joined hearts and minds
Zodiac lovers
Giglovers
