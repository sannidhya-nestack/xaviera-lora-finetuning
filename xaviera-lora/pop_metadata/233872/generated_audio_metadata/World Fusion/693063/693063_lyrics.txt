Beneath the blue and endless sky
Person to person in Samba time
It's the right place to be
I am with you and you're with me
To the sound of a small guitar
Sway to the rhythm and rhyme
And the way to the rest of the summer
Stretches on in December time
We've got all the time in the world
And all the fish in the sea
A boat to sail on the ocean
Got a beach that's golden and free
In the heat of a summer night
That table, that candle light
When the moment we know is right
Stretches on to Samba time
Black coffee, chilli and lime
Sweet mango, mellow and fine
Those memories seem to combine
The magic of Samba time
We've got all the time in the world
All the fish in the sea
Small hotel on the sea shore
A beach that's golden and free
Got a warm blown wind in the sunshine
Got that misty look in your eyes
Got a small hotel on the seashore
And the music of lovers sighs
Oh, hey, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, uh
We've got all the type in the world
All the time in the world
All the fish in the sea
All the fish in the sea
A boat to sail on the ocean
Oh, hey, oh
A beach that's golden and cream
Got a warm blown wind in the sunshine
That misty look in your eyes
Small hotel on the seashore
And the music of lava signs
We've got all the time in the world
All the time in the world
All the time in the world
