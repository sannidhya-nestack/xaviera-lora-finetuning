You can see your mirage
You can see long gone stars
Measuring time every night
You can dream of things which have come to pass (What's the color of the sky?) (What's the color in the eye?) (Can you get the picture right?) (Can you trust your sight?)
Do we really have time to finish this?
Can you tell a truth from a lie?
Can you translate a sign?
When your life is all done
Will you have gone beyond the lines that cross your heart?
What's the color of the sky? What's the color in the eye?
Can you get the picture right? Can you trust your sight?
Wait, wait, say that again, once more
Words can say more than you mean to care
Lies can turn truly white if you dare
You can see your mirror
You can see long gone stars
Measuring time every night
You can dream of things which have come to pass
What's the colour of the sky? What's the colour in the eye?
Can you get the picture right? Can you trust your sight?
