Yesterday I found Tom
Covered in snow lying on the ground
He'd broken his chamber of goals
Just to taste it one more time
I thought the voices were gone
But instead, oh what a crime
They were singing and cheering for him
To lose his mind one more time
So Tom why don't you run and go
To the light at the end of the rabbit hole
But if you choose to stay and dance to the beat
Let me have one last dance at least
It always makes me wonder
Are we born to follow rules?
It makes me wonder why
I've never minded breaking one or two
I'd run through endless fields
I'd search for the rainbow's shore
I'd sail the seas of hell
To steal the voices to hear your true self roar
So Tom why don't you run and go
To the light at the end of the rabbit hole
But if you choose to stay and dance to the beat
Let me have one last dance at least
Get out of the queue
Let the others keep waiting to go in the same direction
As always expecting to get somewhere new
Get out of the queue
Let the others keep waiting to go in the same direction
As always expecting to get somewhere new
So don't worry don't you wrangle, wrangle, wrangle
Off you go, wrangle, wrangle, wrangle
Off you go, wrangle, wrangle, wrangle
Off you go, wrangle, wrangle, wrangle
Off you go
