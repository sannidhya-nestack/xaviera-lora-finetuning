Studying Robin, there's a flu, and I was a young man
I'd court two if one wouldn't love me, the other one would not
Don't you think that notions could?
Studying Blackbird to the crew, I'm XY folks, hate us all
Ever since all the other ones born, it's been a favor to pull up cold
Look to the end, this head's too wide
A lonesome day and a lonesome night
The right house and pretty girls stay
Cold all night and sleep next day
No, no, no, start a total down
There's no way for a gain of love
If you wanna get a house delight
Keep your room awake both day and night
Keep, keep, keep
Keep your room awake both day and night
Keep, keep, keep
Keep, keep, keep
Keep it away, won't die tonight
Keep, keep, keep
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
One for the money and two for the show
When I want another stream to I bow bow bow
One for the money and two for the show
When I want another stream to I bow bow bow
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.
