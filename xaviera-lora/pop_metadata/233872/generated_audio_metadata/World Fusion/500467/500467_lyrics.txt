What is reading the Vedas? What is listening to Japa Japa?
(I'm in pain, I'm in pain)
Are tears anything that does not touch the heart of our loved meeting-brothers?
Non non bananon non bananon non bananon non banananon non bananon non bananon non bananon non banananon
It's the end of your time and I'm done
What do you think of chanting?
What do you think of balance?
What is anything that does not touch the heart of our Lord of the Meeting Rivers?
