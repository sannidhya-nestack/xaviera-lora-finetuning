The deserts to the mountains, the Mediterranean Sea
From Haifa to Jerusalem, Moab and Galilee
Be'Sheva, Ashkelon, Elad and Tel Aviv
A joyful people, simchas every day
We love to dance and sing, eat study and pray
The state of Israel, protecting our land
Together we are strong, united we stand

Portia's coming
The six day war (shot)

Shofar blew, the whole world trembled
Teach children through all generations
Teshuvah! Tefillah!
