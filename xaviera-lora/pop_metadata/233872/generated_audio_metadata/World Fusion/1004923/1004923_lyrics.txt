The waiter asked, "Where did you go?"
I just said, "I did not know"
Should I go after her or just sit here
And eat this lovely tiramisu
Your lovely tiramisu
So I'm sitting here alone
Why'd you leave me on my own?
Must be something that I said
Oh well, there's nothing left to do
to eat your termazoo
Tears on my thermos, ooh
Every bite I think of you
I guess it's too late for us
I really don't know what to do
Tears on my tiramisu
I'm alone, that's nothing new
If only I'd gone after you
I wouldn't be oh so blue
Now I know what I must do
It's so sad that we are through
There'll be tears enough to cry
Each time I look at a lovely termasul
So now I see it's time to go
I'll just walk home nice and slow
With no kiss goodnight from you
I guess there's nothing left for me
But tears on my dermis sole
I'm so sad
