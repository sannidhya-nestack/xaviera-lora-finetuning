Why would you say things that you didn't mean
With no intention to do it made me believe
Even when you gave up, I didn't
I saw forever, you changed that for a minute
You had a hold on my heart and you wouldn't let go, no
Felt disconnected and still couldn't leave you alone, no
We can't even talk and I hate it
But I still wanna call you my baby
Now I just sit back in amazement, it's crazy
Now my heart's cold like December
I never thought it'd be this way between us
And I hardly remember
What we used to be
I can't recall, I'm numb to love
And now I'm so calm
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
When I think back on this relationship
I can't play the victim cause I stayed in it
But you got some soul searching to do that's on you
You can't deny your faults it's all true
You had a hold on my heart and you wouldn't let go, no
Felt disconnected and still couldn't leave you alone, no
We can't even talk and I hate it
But I still wanna call you my baby
Now I just sit back in amazement, it's crazy
Now my heart's cold like December
I never thought it'd be this way between us
And I hardly remember
What we used to be, I can't recall, I'm numb to love
You were everything about me
And you knew everything about me
Since you're gone and not around me
Everything is cloudy
And my heart's cold, it started to freeze
I don't know what it is to feel my heart at ease
I just gotta be honest
I just gotta be honest
Oh, oh, I just, I just gotta be honest
