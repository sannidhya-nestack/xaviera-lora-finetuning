Moon dancer
You've really put a spell on me
Enchanted my dreams now all I can see
Are the contours of your body swaying
So now I look into the moon, I look into the moon
Wishing you and I will be together soon
I look into the moon, I look into the moon
Wishing you and I will be together soon
I look into the moon, I look into the moon
Wishing you and I will be together soon
I look into the moon, I look into the moon
Wishing you and I will be together soon
Dancer, you really put a spell on me
Enchanted my ears now all I can hear
Is the heavenly song of your body swaying
So now I look into the moon, I look into the moon
Wishing you and I will be together soon
I look into the moon, I look into the moon
Wishing you and I will be together soon
I look into the moon, I look into the moon
Wishing you and I will be together soon
I look into the moon, I look into the moon
Wishing you and I will be together soon
Dancer, you really put a spell on me
Enchanted my words with your smiling pearls
And the versification of your body swaying
So now I look into the moon, I look into the moon
Wishing you and I will be together soon
I look into the moon, I look into the moon
Wishing you and I will be together soon
I look into the moon, I look into the Moon
Wishing you and I will be together soon
I look into the moon, I look into the Moon
Wishing you and I will be together soon

Wishing you and I would be together soon
