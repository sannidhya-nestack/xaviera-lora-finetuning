I'm still up now being up
Not going down, back up
Dem a listen when the beat drop
They know me speaking so they focus
Dem a hit it deep in your ear drums
Who telling you say bad man no fi drop
When you make it right they throat and trumps
She love me no more and no day for bread crumbs
She a fi turn a brother to panning great
When the temperature they rise up
She tell me like who knew
Like who you
But now I'm shutting the place down no voodoo
When I bust a rhymes the girls they make laughter
The vibration every time the bass drop
Oh my nose are full now
Kanna mi manton now
A no BJJ see muti pen now
I'm on that new wave oh na na
My music moving kilo
No Gram say I'm moving kilo
She be my girl to go dey make dem hello
Who be the bagga we won't be no gojo
Kilo, so when I step say my people follow
And when I drop say them must to feelo
It no matter if nah reggae a weelo
My music moving kilo
Now gram say I'm moving kilo
Chibi magwe do good they make them mellow
Ubi di baga we hung we no wardrobe
Kilo, so when I step say my people follow
And when I drop say them must do filo
It no matter if nah the girl a willow, the girl a willow
I put the order on a rush rush
Big boss see the money was a hush hush
Used to put em boys on the corner where the bucks was
Big moves and you know them laws couldn't touch us
Now we spitting on them shoes had to cost much
When you stick by the rules you don't trust much
Before they didn't wanna bother, it was just us
Had to take the sound across the border, had it brushed up
Now we got them girls running up, wanna crush us
they see the way the diamonds clus, wanna touch us
Way before they seen the shining gloss, it was just us
Back when my boy had the clutch on the bus top
Looking must up, you play tough, you get dust up
Now we big top, and my people on the up up
We get big top, kilo cut when we big talk
We own big blocks, we gon' bust like a boss
My music moving kilo
No grams, say I'm moving kilo
Shaping my bread to good, they make them mellow
Who be the bad guy, we won't be no outro
Ah, kilo
So when I step say my people follow
And when I drop say they must to feel oh
It no matter if nah the girl a will oh
My music moving kilo
Now gram say I'm moving kilo
Chibi my girl do good they make them mellow
Ruby the bagga we want we no wardrobe
Ah, kilo
So when I step say my people follow
And when I drop say they must to feel oh
It no matter if nah the girl a will oh
The girl a will oh
