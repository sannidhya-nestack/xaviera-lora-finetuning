Got a lovely girl from China
Lots of loveliness inside her
Travelled round the world to find her
She's good looking, she's a blinder
Love, the way she looks at me
Is this the way we'll always be?
Not much Asia left inside her
She's my English girl from China
And then when we go out dancing
She loves cuddles and romancing
We found love when we were playing
And the rest goes without saying
One thing led to another
Please don't tell her mother
Not much Asia left inside her
She's my English girl from China
Time has come for me to ask her
Will she come and be my partner?
We've so many things in common
I don't want to be without her
Will she come or leave me
I'll just have to try and see
Lots of loving left inside her
She's my English girl from China
Got a lovely girl from China
Lots of loveliness inside her
And then when we go out dancing
She loves cuddles and romancing
Will she come or leave me?
She's the one I've chosen
Will she be my love forever?
She's my English girl from China
