I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a
I'm not a good girl, you're my idiot
I'm not a good girl, you're my idiot
I'm not a good girl, you're my idiot
(Polish)
I'm good, I'm not not okay
You say it, but I can't make it okay
You say it, but I can't make it
Who's in my body key?
I'm not good, in my body key
You say it, but I can't make it now
But you say it, but I can't make it
In my body key, with me
But you say it, but I can't make it
I'm not good, I ain't never, I'm not good, I ain't never, I'm not good, I ain't never
Jai jai jai jai jai jai jai jai jai jai jai jai jai jai
(singing)
