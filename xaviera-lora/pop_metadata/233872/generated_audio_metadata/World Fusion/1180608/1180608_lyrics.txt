I've been searching all along
For the place I really belong
My search takes me to strange places
With people of different races
How long will this go on?
Until I find my dream lane
Until I find the great place
My search goes on and on and on and on
That is why I'm a troubling man
With no place to really call home
And I'll keep moving on
Until I find a place to settle down
Some people may think I am weird
They act like I'm your neighbor ever satisfied
Even when everything seems to be going fine
I wanna move on after a time
I tell them this is not the right place for me
Which I know is difficult for them to say
So I end up losing some friends
But I love to move on
Following my intuitions
And that is why I'm a troubling man
With no place to really call home
And I'll keep moving on
Until I find a place to settle down, settle down
In this world there are many like me
They enjoy the thrills of landing in a new shore
The thrills of different ways of living
The thrills of a new culture they adore
If you ask me this is a great way to live
The magic of trouble has to give, yeah
Until I find the dream lane
And I'll keep moving on and on and on
That is why I'm a trouble in me
With no place to really call home
And I'll keep moving on
Until I find a place to settle down
That is why I am a troubling man
With no place to really call home
And I'll keep moving on
Until I find a place to settle down
Settle down
That is why
Oh yeah
Whoa
Oh yeah
That is why I am a troubling man
With no place to really go
