I feel the silence
In these four corners
But through my window
I see you out there
Around the world
Around the world
Around the world
In my head
In my head
In our own spaces
Small words are spoken
Through understanding
Chains will be broken
Around the world
Around the world
Around the world
To your heart
Around the world
Around the world
Around the world
To your heart
To your heart
Yeah, around the world, around the world, around the world to your heart
