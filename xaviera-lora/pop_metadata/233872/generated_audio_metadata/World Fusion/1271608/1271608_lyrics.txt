It's time
It's time to change direction
It's time to move along
Get away from the obstructions
Get to where I really belong
It's so wrong what you doing
I don't believe what you saying
You won't keep me down I'll be moving
It's a brand new day and I'm not playing
It's time to change directions
It's time to move along
Get away from the obstructions
Get to where I really belong
Listen me right now
Hear what I'm saying
Pay close attention
It's time for auction
It's time
My cup is overflowing
My poor heart is aching
My work has been very exhausting
Got to follow my gut feeling
It's time to change directions
It's time to move along
Get away from the obstructions
Get to where I really belong
