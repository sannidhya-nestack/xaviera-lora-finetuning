Yes sir
I did my own
I just did reminisce
Back when I only me
They carry six men
For my back
For my shoulder
Get the evidence
And I was diligent
It was very evident
Me and my guys stand
Say we go feet blow
Steady they fire them
Say we go soon blow
Come off a street then
I suppose like them
But now my hand them
And I no et them
Cause see the guys them
et the messos
Nah so I tie her first
Say make them carry go
One day for late cost
One steady carry on
I take back it then
But nobody show love
I was so hot
But man go carry on
I do my thing around my race
I see they function
And I go carry first
And you go confirm
And you go confess
Now I have the pompous
Take a look at me
Ah oh yeah take a look at you
Put you for my shoes (bang, bang, bang)
Oh yeah, let me see you at the food (bang, bang, bang)
Take a look at me (bang, bang, bang)
Ah, oh yeah, take a look at you (bang, bang, bang)
Put you for my shoes (bang, bang, bang)
Ah, let me see you at the food (bang-bang-bang)
Take a look at me (ah-ah-ah-ah)
Ah, oh yeah, take a look at you
Put you for my shoes (ah-ah-ah-ah)
Ah, oh yeah, let me at your food (ah-ah-ah-ah)
