Leave it all behind you
Go into the unknown
Adventure or a torture
Goodbye to all you've known
It's hope that drives you forward
Clutching at your dreams
What you find here might delight you
Or not be what it seems
It's a broken life
Dreams have been destroyed
Clinging to your sanity
Staring in the void
It's a broken life
Families torn apart
Far away from home now
It will break your heart
Across so many countries
Feeling so alone
Searching for a friendly face
To make you feel at home
Moving in the darkness
Afraid of every sound
Scared to ask a question
Staying underground
It's a broken life
Chewed up and spat out
Far away from family
Filled with fear and doubt
It's a broken life of terror and of pain
Far away from those you love you'll never see again
Ah, ah, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I am the way that I am, I am the way that I am
It's a broken life, families torn apart
Far away from home now, it will break your heart
It's a broken life, of terror and of pain
Far away from those who love you
That you'll never see again
Don't talk, keep down
There's always something in the dark
