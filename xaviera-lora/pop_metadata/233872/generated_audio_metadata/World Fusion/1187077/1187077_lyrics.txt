Shawty got me feeling like a winner
With the way she flow up on me heart like a river
She dey make me shiver
She a sexy diva, me nah call her Carolina
Dey young me have to give her air
Nah she got me feeling like a brother
With she do that nothing when I swear me dey cash cold
Me go follow her anywhere she go
Cause all the things she do to me got me losing control
Mercedes get it make my head it turn around
I hope to create all the journey all through the nights
She grant me access to a paradise
When they can scream I'm back all night like a bingo
Not the way she dey do me

You let them if we the go we say
Come on all the way, all the way, all the way, all the way
She left me the doomsayers
She say I'm valid, them other boys invalid
So when they try to log in she pay, I says deny them
As the beat goes on, she whisper
She say bad man we can't do it any where he won't let me down
Now she got me feeling like a pro the way she do that out to when I swear me the cash code
Biggo follow her everywhere she go cause all the things she do to me got me lose in control
Mercedes get it, make my head turn around
I just took me on the journey all through the night
She grant me access to her paradise and make her scream I'm back all night like a biggo
