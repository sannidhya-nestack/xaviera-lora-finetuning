Winter on the run
Ooh, winter on the road
Ooh
No worries, no flurries, white flakes and red stockings, red wine
Hot with spices keeps us warm when it's cold
Strong winds and skies of grey can make me stay home today
It's winter on the road
Rockwurst and Yule logs
No falls after morning fog
It's winter on the road
I'm mailing my presents home
I'm flying with the carry on
It's winter on the road
