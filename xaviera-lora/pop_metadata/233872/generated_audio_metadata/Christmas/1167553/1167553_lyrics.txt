The season's doing what the season does
It's perfection if perfection ever was
But I wanna do more for the one I adore
Baby, I'm no superhero, that's for sure
Oh, but if I could be Jack Frost for a day
I'd paint your heart with Cupid's dots on airy icy windowpane
I'd make your Christmas white just like a true winter wizard
And if kisses were snowflakes, I'd send you a blizzard
That mistletoe is getting the show tonight
In your loving arms darling all is calm and bright
But it's still not enough
When it comes to your love
I wanna spend December wrapped up in this rush
And if I could be Rudolph for a day
I'd guide you through the toughest storm and help to light your way
Back home around our fireplace with that red and golden glitter
And if kisses were snowflakes, well I'd send you a blizzard
Oh, if I could just be Santa for a day, just a day
I'd fill your stockings up with love and keep you warm and safe
And bring you all your heart desires, all I could deliver
And if kisses were snowflakes, well, I'd send you a blizzard
Well it's clear to see I'm just lucky me
All things considered
But if kisses were snowflakes
I'd send you a blizzard
Ooh here comes a blizzard
Mmm
