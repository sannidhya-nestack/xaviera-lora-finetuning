Christmas Eve in Italy, is Santa's favourite stop
He darrent a little jingle bell up on the chimney top
Christmas Eve in Italy, is Santa's favourite spot
The little bombino they leave him the vino and pasta in a pot
A red linguine and viscala pide and minestrone soup
He munches salami, a little pastrami and lots of bread and fruit
A toaster, a bouillon, pasta, fagioli and antipasto too
A mozzarella and sfigliatella, some olives and prosciutto
Christmas Eve in Italy is Santa's favourite stop
He darts a little jingle bell upon the chimney top
Christmas Eve in Italy Santa's having fun
But reindeer and doffles he had not for sale will weigh a ton
Ha ha ha, the candy canes, the boulyabays
Ha ha ha, he mange till he drop
Ha ha ha, the demitasse, give him gas
Ha ha ha, or will he ever stop
Buon appetito Santa, mangia, mangia
How about another spumoni, tottoni, an espresso?
Have a cigar too, eh? We love you Santa Claus
Shake, shake, shake, Santa shake his butt
Tap, tap, tap, Santa tap on his gut
Up, up, up, Rudolph pull on his sled
Up, up, up, reindeer now are dead
