We've been reminiscing since September
Counting down the days impatiently
Now it's the twenty-fourth day of December
And the children just can't get to sleep
Hear them giggle with anticipation
As they lie awake in bed and dream
Of the sights and sounds and celebration
Of tomorrow morning's Christmas scene
Tip-tip-tap of tiptoes dancing down the hallway
Wide eyes pierce the darkness, beaming with surprise
Joyful claps that break the early morning silence
Telling mom and dad it's time to rise
Garlands drape the spiraling stairway
Pinecone potpourri of cinnamon
Tables decked with silver and fine china
Framing grandma's fudge and sugar plums
We've been reminiscing since September
Counting down the days impatiently
Now it's the 24th day of December
And the children just can't get to sleep
Hear them giggle with anticipation
As they lie awake in bed and dream
Of the sights and sounds and celebration
Of tomorrow morning's Christmas scene
Stockings overflow with each one's favorite treasure
Heirloom gems and trinkets decorate the tree
Loaded branches dressed in gleaming Christmas splendor
Presents spilling out from underneath
Carols playing on the old piano
As we harmonize familiar tunes
Sipping warm hot chocolate by the firelight
As grandpa's story's liven up the room
Christmas Eve casts a magic spell that time can't erase
Do the kids know that mom and dad are still wide awake
We've been reminiscing since September
Counting down the days impatiently
Now it's the twenty-fourth day of December
And the children just can't get to sleep
Hear them giggle with anticipation
As they lie awake in bed and dream
Of the sights and sounds and celebration
Of tomorrow morning's Christmas scene
Of tomorrow morning's Christmas scene
This must seem
