The nights are twinkling in the night
Every star is shining bright
Underneath the moon so high
Dreams are dancing in the sky
Stockings hung by fire's light
Hopes and wishes take their flight
Santa's sleigh is on its way
Magic fills the air today
Wish upon the Christmas tree
Love and joy for you and me
Close your eyes and make a dream
Everything is what it seems
Candy canes and mist on toe
Hearts are warm despite the snow
Children laughing all around
Happiness in every sound
In your heart came memories
Of the joy and peace you seek
Sparkle in your eyes will stay
Even when it fades away
Wish upon the Christmas tree
The love and joy for you and me
Close your eyes and make a dream
Everything is what it seems
Can't you die, oh, oh, can't you die, oh, oh, can't you die, oh, oh, can't you die
