And they fought me for a throne
A newborn king to see for a throne
Our finest gifts we bring for a throne
To lay before the king for a throne, throne, throne, throne, throne, throne, throne, throne
So to honour him for a throne, throne
When we come
Little baby
Ba rum ba bum bum
I am a poor boy too
Ba rum ba bum bum
I have no gift to bring
Ba rum ba bum bum bum ba bum
That's fit to give our feet
Ba rum ba bum bum bum bum bum
They told me
Ba rum ba bum bum bum ba bum
They told me
A new born can't see
Our finest gifts we bring
