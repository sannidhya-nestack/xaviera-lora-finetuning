Silent night, silent night
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, silent night
Sleep
Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
yon virgin
Mother and child
Holy infant, so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace, peace
Sleep in heavenly peace, peace (sleep in heavenly peace)
Silent night, silent night, sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, silent night, sleep in heavenly peace
It was a silent night, it was a holy night
Wondrous star, wondrous star
All the night with the angels
Let us sing, let us sing, let us sing
Alleluia to You
To our King, oh Christ, the Savior is born
I'm so glad He's born, Christ, the Savior is born
Silent night, silent night, hallelujah, hallelujah
Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, silent night, sleep in heavenly peace
Heavenly peace, silent night, silent night
Holy night (sleep in heavenly peace)
Silent night, holy night (silent night, silent night)
Oh, oh, oh (sleep)
Silent night, ooh
