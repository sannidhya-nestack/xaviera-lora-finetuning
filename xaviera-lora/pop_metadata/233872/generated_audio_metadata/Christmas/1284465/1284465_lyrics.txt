Tiny hats upon their heads, now time to stop
In the workshop they don't rest, they make it pop
With a hop and a skip they bring the cheer
Christmas has our busy time of year
Jingle bells and laughter fill the air
Candy canes and toys are everywhere
Working hard but not having fun night or day
Dancing, swinging in the elf-like way
Oh, the elves are on the move tonight
Making magic, spreading light
Dancing, swinging'til the morning bright
Elves on the move, what a sight
Their sparkles paint their little shoes
Every task they tackle they can't lose
With a wink and a smile they're quick to go
Twinkling eyes and faces all aglow
Ho ho ho they hear Santa's call
Tiny feet hustle down the hall
Packed with gifts they ride the snowy flight
Elves in action it's a Christmas night
Oh the elves are on the move tonight
Making magic spreading light
Dancing sweet till the morning bright
Elves on the move what a sight
