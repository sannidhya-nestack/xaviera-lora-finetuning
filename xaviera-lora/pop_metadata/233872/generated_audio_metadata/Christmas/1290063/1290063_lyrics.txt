Snowflakes fall on a winter night
Reindeer sleigh taking flight
Chimneys calling through frosty air
Santa's got presents to share
Ho, ho, ho in a sleigh so fast
Candy canes and dreams that last
Jingle bells on rooftops high
Santa's rocking through the sky
Knit and snug on the old red suit
Boots crunchin' on a snow-so-mute
Stockings hangin' by the fire's glow
Santa's laugh in the cold night's flow
Ho, ho, ho in a sleigh so fast
Candy canes and dreams that last
Jingle bells on rooftops high
Santa's rocking through the sky
Reindeer hooves keep the rhythm tight
Guiding Santa through the silent night
Milky ways and cookies bite
Santa's joy shining bright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, it'll slay so fast
Candy canes and dreams that last
Jingle bells on rooftops high
Santa's rockin' through the sky
