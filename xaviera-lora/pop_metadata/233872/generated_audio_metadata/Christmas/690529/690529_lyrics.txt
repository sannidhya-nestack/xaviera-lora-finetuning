Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother
In mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night
Holy night, shepherds quake at the sight
Glory stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born (Silent night) Silent night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redemption
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
