Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Jolly old Saint Nicholas, lean your ear this way
Don't you tell a single soul what I'm gonna say
Christmas Eve is coming soon, now you dear old man
Whisper what you'd bring to me
Tell me if you can
When the clock is striking twelve
When I'm fast as feed
Down the chimney broad and black
With your pack you'll creep
All the stockings you will find hanging in a row
Mine will be the shortest one
You'll be sure to know
When the clock is striking twelve
When I'm fast asleep
Down the chimney, brown and black
With your pack you creep
Oh, Johnny, old Saint Nicholas
Lean your ear this way
Don't you tell a single soul what I'm going to say
Christmas Eve is coming soon, now you dear old man
Whisper what you bring to me, tell me if you can
When the clock is striking twelve
When I'm fast asleep
Down the chimney broad and black
With your pack you'll creep
All the stockings you will find
Hanging in a row
Mine will be the shortest one
You'll be sure to know
You'll be sure to know
