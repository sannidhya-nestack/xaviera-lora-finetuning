It sure gets cold this time of year
The winter chills me to the bone
Maybe I should disappear
To a warmer kind of place
A warmer kind of place
Then I see those Christmas lights, lightin' up the midnight sky
Feel the magic of this winter wonderland
Feel Jack Frost kiss my face, watch the snow cover this place
Take a walk through Central Park
I love Christmas in New York
It seems the city never sleeps
Too wide awake to sleep myself
Windows sharpen everywhere
Look there's Santa and a child's dance
Then I see those Christmas lights
Lightin' up the midnight sky
Feel the magic of this winter wonderland
Feel Jack Frost kiss my face
Watch the snow cover this place
Take a walk through Central Park
Oh I love Christmas
Jingle bells, chestnuts roasting Neighborhoods caroling through these city streets
I love Christmas in New York
Then I see those Christmas lights lighting up the midnight sky
Feel the magic of this winter wonderland
Feel Jack Frost kiss my face
Watch the snow cover this place
Take a walk through Central Park, oh
Why love Christmas in New York?
I love Christmas in New York
I love Christmas in New York
