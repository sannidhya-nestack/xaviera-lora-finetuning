Snowman, snowman, here comes the snowman
Full of cheer, it's that time of year
Snowman, snowman, here comes the snow man
Christmas time is here
Sleigh bells are ringing and children are singing
Lots of excitement is in the air
Sleigh bells are ringing and children are singing

Snowman, snowman, here comes the snowman
Full of cheer, it's that time of year
Snowman, snowman, here comes the snow man
Christmas time is here
Santa, Santa, now here comes Santa
With lots of toys for the girls and boys
Santa, Santa, now here comes Santa
Christmas time is here
Snowman, snowman, here comes the snowman
Full of cheer, it's that time of year
Snowman, snowman, here comes the snow man
