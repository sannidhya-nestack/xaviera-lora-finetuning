Sleigh bells are ringing low
Feel the magic speaks to glow
Oh yes, this holiday
Snowflakes dance all around
Joy and laughter in every sound
Oh yes, this holiday
Listen to the chiming bells
For everyone the joy it tells
Oh, this holiday will be a merry, merry time for me
Candles in windows gleam
Families gather, making the dream
Oh yes, this holiday
Children's faces in light
Stars are crinkling in the night
Oh yes, this holiday
Listen to the chiming bells
For everyone the joy tells
Oh
I hope this holiday will be
A merry merry time for me
Underneath the shimmering tree
Love encircles you and me
Hear the jingle through the air
Everywhere listen to the chiming bells
For everyone the joy it tells
Oh this holiday will be a merry merry time for me
