Golden dawn on Christmas day
Magic in each sunlit ray
Presents wrapped with love and care
Joy and laughter fill the air
In the hush of morning light
Everything feels just right
Christmas morning light
So bright
Bringing warmth, pure delight
In this moment love is clear
Christmas spirit always near
Baking cookies sweet and warm
Cozy in this festive norm
Voices rise in callow song
Harmony where we belong
In the hush of morning light
Everything feels just right
Christmas morning light
So bright
Bringing warmth, pure delight
In this moment love is clear
Christmas spirit always near
Baking cookies sweet and warm
Cozy in this festive norm
Voices rise in carol song
Harmony where we belong
In the hush of morning light
Everything feels just right
Christmas morning light
So bright
Bringing warmth, pure delight
In this moment love is clear
Christmas spirit always near
Snow-capped trees and frosted eaves
Memories like fallen leaves
In your eyes, a shining gleam
Christmas feels just like a dream
Christmas morning light, so bright
Bringing warmth, pure delight
In this moment love is clear
Christmas spirit always near
