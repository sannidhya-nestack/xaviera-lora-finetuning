When the fire's lit so bright and the chill is out of sight
You can feel the glow that's warming up the space
With our hearts so full and light in this cozy silent night
Laughing near the flames, let's dance in the place
Oh, I love these fireside moments so dear
With love surrounded, bringing so much cheer
Oh, the warmth we feel when we're alright here
In the glow of love and fire
Now the embers start to glow
Through the window falls the snow
But within these walls there's merry light and love
With a blanket by our side
We'll let the world just slide
Enjoying every whisper soft like stars above
Oh, I love these fireside moments so dear
With love surrounding, breathe so much sheer
Oh, the warmth we feel when we're all right here
In the glow of a loving fire
As the night turns into dawn so bright
Hold me close and whisper soft goodnight
Every moment here just feels so right
Together by the firelight
Oh, I love these fireside moments so dear
With love surrounded, bringin' so much cheer
Oh, the warmth we feel when we're all right here
In the glow of love and fire
