Jingle bells, hear them ring, listen to the joy they bring
Stars are shining oh so bright on this beautiful Christmas night
Santa's coming dressed in red, while we're all tucked in bed
He's got presents big and small, it's a merry Christmas for us all
Snowflakes fall, pure and white
Making such a lovely sight
Trees are twinkling pretty bright
Candles are glowing through the night
Santa's coming dressed in red
While we're all tucked in bed
He's got presents big and small
It's a merry Christmas for us all
Snowflakes fall, pure and white
Making such a lovely sight
Trees are twinkling pretty and bright
Candles are glowing through the night
Santa's coming dressed in red
While we're all tucked in bed
He's got presents big and small
It's a merry Christmas for us all
Snowflakes fall, pure and white
Making such a lovely sight
Trees are twinkling, pretty and bright
Candles are glowing through the night
Candles are glowing through the night
Blessing merry, let's be gay
On this wonderful Christmas day
Love and joy everywhere
It's a time for us to share
See the twinkling lights so bright
On this special Christmas night
Cozy fires oh so warm
Safe and sound from winter storm
Santa's sleigh up so high
Dashing through the Christmas sky
Presents wrapped with lots of care
Christmas joy is in the air
Snowman white and reindeer play
On this merry Christmas day
Jingle bells go tingling
Oh what joy the season brings
Santa's sleigh up so high
Dashing through the Christmas sky
Presents wrapped with lots of care
Christmas joy is in the air
Hear the laughter, see the cheer
