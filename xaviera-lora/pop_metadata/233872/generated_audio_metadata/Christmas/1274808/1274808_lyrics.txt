The snow falls on a silent street
Santa's sleigh, a Christmas tree
Twinkling lights on every lane
Holiday cheer, it ain't no game
Noel, Noel, stockings hung high
Reindeer prance across the sky
Carolers singing out of key
But it's all good, they're full of glee
Noel, Noel
Ringing bells galore
Spark of magic at your door
Noel, Noel
Hearts ignite
Celebrate this starry night
Gingerbread fresh from the oven
Warm hugs everybody's loving
Mistletoe above our head
Holiday spirit widespread
Winter winds they start to blow
Cuddled up with faces of glow
Hot cocoa with a sprinkle dash
Under stars that sing and flash
Noel, Noel
Ringing bells galore
Spark of magic at your door
Noel, Noel
Hearts ignite
Celebrate this starry night
Winter winds they start to blow
Cuddled up with faces aglow
Hot cocoa with a sprinkled dash
Under stars that sing and flash
Noel, Noel, ringing bells galore
Spark of magic at your door
Noel, Noel, hearts ignite
Celebrate this starry night
