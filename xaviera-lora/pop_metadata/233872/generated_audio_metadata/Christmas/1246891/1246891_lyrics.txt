We sing the songs of silver bells and one-horse open sleigh
With hardly a thought of the sacred birth that came upon this day
The modern world has a breakneck pace
That never seems to ease
But for a moment we might turn our thoughts
To the Prince of Peace
The story begins with three wise men who traveled from afar
To the Savior's birth in Bethlehem
Guided by a star
Bringing finest gift to the newborn King
They fell down on their knees
In wonder of God's greatest gift
The baby prince of peace
On the earth that holy night
Was shown the brightest light
Redemption to absolve the sins of man
And now two thousand years have passed
And buildings crowd the skies
And those of us with silver hair
Saw the change before our eyes
And the lucky ones burned the old tide log
From a place of wealth and ease
But none too high to look up this night
And praise the Prince of Peace
And I will look to the stars this night
And praise the Prince of Peace
