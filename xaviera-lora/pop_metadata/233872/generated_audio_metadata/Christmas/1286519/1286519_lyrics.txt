Twinkling lights like stars above
Smell of pine, fresh baked love
Cocoa warms our fingertips
Holidays on joyful lips
Snowflakes dance like tiny sprites
Laughter fills the chilly nights
Stockings hung, the fire glows
Magic in each flake of snow
Loving the holidays, cheers and delight
Every day feels oh so bright
Gifts of love wrapped in a bowl
Hearts that glow
Let the spirit flow
Oh, oh
Kerala singing harmony
Memories hung on the Christmas tree
Family are no better gift
Hearts together, spirits lift
Candles flicker in the din
Joy and peace start to begin
Every smile a holiday with sheets
Moment wrapped in bliss
Loving the holidays, cheers and delight
Everyday feels oh so bright
Gifts of love wrapped in a bow
Hearts aglow, let the spirit flow
Candles flicker in the dim
Joy and peace start to begin
Every smile a holiday wish
Each moment wrapped in bliss
Loving the holidays, cheers and delight
Everyday feels oh so bright
Gifts of love wrapped in a bow
Hearts aglow, let the spirit flow
