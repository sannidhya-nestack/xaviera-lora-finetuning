Oh, what a lovely time of year
Wish away your cares and make your dreams come true
And I wanna spend the night chasing down the stars
And all the reindeer too
And oh, what a fine line lovely Christmas
And oh, what a fine line lovely day
Twinkling lights and dancing holly
Everyone's so bright and jolly
And in love like I love you
It's a falla lovely Christmas
Yeah, what a dreamy time of year
And everyone I care about
Is gathered here tonight, mmm
Yeah, it's nothing quite like this
Let the snow come down
It's warm under these lights
And oh what a fun, la, la, lovely Christmas
And oh what a fun, la, la, lovely day
Twinkling lights and dancing holly
Everyone so bright and jolly
And in love like I love you
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Oh, what a fine line, lovely Christmas
Oh, what a fine line, lovely day
Twinkling lights and dancing holly
Everyone's so bright and jolly
And enough
Like I love you
It's a falla lovely Christmas
A falla lovely Christmas
A falla lovely Christmas
