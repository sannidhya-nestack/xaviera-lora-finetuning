Christmas lights
See them shine in the eyes of a child
Let them shine
I used to be one of them
Christmas trees in the sand
Let them shine
As I fell for your spell
Christmas bells like a symphony
Through the air, Christmas flare
Floats a simple melody
Merry Christmas
Can you feel it, if you feel it
Then sing with me, I wish you
Merry Christmas, may all your dreams come true
And I hear choir singing, bells ringing by the Christmas tree
And I wonder if you could make my dreams come true and spend it here with me
Angels fly, night sky
Magic lights in our heart
Light a spark
Let's bake Christmas cake and
Ice skate on a frozen lake
Favorite day
Be free, just be
Like a big family
In this time
Erase the line
And unite the whole world
Merry Christmas
Can you feel it?
If you feel it
Then sing with me
I wish you
Merry Christmas, may all your dreams come true
And I hear choir singing bells ringing by the Christmas tree
And I wonder if you could make my dreams come true and spend it here with me
And I wonder if you could make my dreams come true
And spend it here with me
