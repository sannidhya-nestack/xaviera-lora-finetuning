Snowy trails of sleigh bells ring
Wrapped in warmth our hearts take wing
Underneath the starry night
Holding close everything's right
In the stillness hear the song
Christmas magic all night long
Midnight sleigh ride side by side
Through the snow our love will glide
Keys and hearts aligned
Christmas dreams so intertwined
Blankets pulled up to our chins
Laughing as the ride begins
Snowflakes dancing in the air
Moments shared beyond compare
In stillness hear the song
Mmm Christmas magic all night long
Midnight sleigh rides side by side
Through the snow our love will glide
Ease and hearts aligned
Christmas dreams so intertwined
Moonlight casts a silver glow, guiding us through fields of snow
In your eyes I see the light, Christmas love, pure and bright
Midnight sleigh ride side by side
Through the snow our love will glide
In this season hearts align
Christmas dreams so intertwined
