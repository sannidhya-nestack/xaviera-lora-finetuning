Let's go out and see the lights
It's Christmas time tonight
It may be cold but we'll be bold
And bundle up real tight
And even though the winds may blow
We'll be safe and warm
Just you and me, the Christmas trees, and walking on and on
Far from the pace of a shopper's race, there is a place I know
Where we can spy on a starry sky, make angels in the snow
In Central Park on a carriage ride
We'll build a snowman too
And make a wish sealed with a kiss
Like lovers do
No matter the weather
I'll stay warm together with you
You, you hold me close
And we'll make the most of this yuletide love light
So let's go out and see the lights
It's Christmas time tonight
The city lights are shining bright
It's such a wondrous sight
We'll reminisce and we'll steal a kiss
Then we can go inside and light a fire
And let desire fill the night
We'll toast by that fire and sip on a cider or two
You hold me close and we'll make the most of this yuletide so right
So let's go out and see the lights
It's Christmas time tonight
We'll make a vow, let's do it now
There's love in every breath
Glorious view
All shiny and new
So let's go out and see the lights
Like lovers do
We'll make a memory that will last
Our whole lives through
So let's go out and see the lights
Just me and you
Let's go out and see the lights (Let's go out and see the lights)
Let's go out and see the lights (Let' go out and see the lights)
Let's go out and see the lights, honey
