Christmas time comes once a year
Holidays bring good cheer
Presents under the tree
Means nothing if you're not here with me
Every day with you is Christmas
Sleigh bells ring, silent night
Caroling stars shine bright
Let's trim the Christmas tree
And share some eggnog and cookies
Making special memories
Family time, good company
the season to be jolly
Trimmed with mistletoe and holly
Spirit of love and generosity
Christmas time comes once a year
Holidays bring good cheer
Presents under the tree
Means nothing if you're not here with me
Every day with you is Christmas
Waiting up at night to see
Santa coming down the chimney
A sack of presents under the tree
For every girl and boy who believes
Spirit of love and generosity
Christmas time comes once a year
Holidays bring good cheer
Presence under the tree
Means nothing if you're not here with me
Every day with you is Christmas
Christmas time comes once a year
Holidays bring good cheer
Presents under the tree
Means nothing if you're not here with me
Every day with you is Christmas
Anywhere you are is home to me
Let's start an end with a kiss
Every day with you is Christmas
