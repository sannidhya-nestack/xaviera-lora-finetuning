Your December smile I haven't seen in a while is just what I need
I see you looking at me while I'm trimming the tree and my heart skips a beat
The presents are wrapped, the stockings are hung
It's a perfect night to spend some time on us
It don't get no better than this
Just me and you
Caught in a peppermint kiss
Heartstrings are jingling, we're tangled and tingling
Oh what a beautiful rush
Let's spend the rest of the night
Making the mistletoe blush
There's a blanket there on our favorite chair we could cozy up
Snuggle up for a few and let passion do what passion does
We decked all the halls, there's nothing we missed
Only one thing left I'm checking off my list
It don't get no better than this
Just me and you
Caught in a peppermint kiss
Heartstrings are jingling, we're tangled and tingling
Oh what a beautiful rush
Let's spend the rest of the night
Making the mistletoe blush
Ooh, the presents are wrapped
The stockings are hung
It's a perfect night to make a little Yuletide love
It don't get no better than this
Just me and you
Caught in a peppermint kiss
Heartstrings are jingling, we're tangled and tingling
Oh what a beautiful rush
Let's spend the rest of the night
Making the mistletoe
Rest of the night
Making the mistletoe rest of the night
Making the mistletoe blush
Making the mistletoe blush
Making the mistletoe blush
