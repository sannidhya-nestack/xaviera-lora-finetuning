With snowflakes dancing outside
Under mistletoe we hide our delight
The fire's low, the music's so bright
Sipping cocoa on this Christmas night
Wrapped in a blanket, your hand in mine
This season's joy, so pure, so divine
Oh oh oh
What's the magic ringing?
Oh, oh, oh
Hear the angels singing
Twinkling lights on the evergreen
Reflecting love such as serene
Sing chestnuts, roses, whistles and lychid dreams
A symphony of joy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In your eyes the stars align
With every kiss our spirits shine
Did it? Nay, no, why?
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Dizzily-blilly, dizzily-blilly, dizzily-billily, dizzily-billily, oh yeah
Hear the angels sing
As the clock strikes twelve
Hold on tight to the mistletoe
Hearts take flight in this jazzy night
Of your delight
We'll dance until the morning light
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Watch the magic ringing in the hall
In the ancient sin
