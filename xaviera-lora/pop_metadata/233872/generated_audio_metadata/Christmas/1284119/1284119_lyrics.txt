Santa's latest beatin' passed through the glittering night
Reindeer flying high, a star shining so bright
It's a race against the moon, moving like a tune
Gifts and joy in every home arriving soon
Jingle bells ring, and we all sing
Santa's in a hurry, hear the magic he brings
Snowflakes dance while we take a chance
On this dazzling night of festive romance
Through the chimney slide gifts cannot hide
Santa's list check twice with wide-eyed pride
Sacks are heavy but his smile never fades
Guided by the moonlight through the snowy glades
Midnight stroke but he's still afloat
With every twist and turn the magic he'll invoke
Time's running thin but he won't give in
Holiday joy rides on every gust of wind
Jingle bells ring and we all sing
Santa's in a hurry, hear the magic he brings
Snowflakes dance while we take a chance
On this dazzling night of festive romance
Through the chimney slide gifts cannot hide
Santa's list checked twice with wide-eyed pride
Sacks are heavy but his smile never fades
Guided by the moonlight through the snowy glades
Midnight stroke but he's still afloat
With every twist and turn the magic he'll invoke
Time's running thin but he won't give in
Holiday joy rides on every gust of wind
Elves wave goodbye as he soars to the sky
Every child's dream tonight will fly
He's rewriting the night in the book of delight
Catching up to joy and making things right
Smile never fades
Guided by the moonlight through the snowy glades
Through the chimney slide gifts cannot hide
Santa's list check twice with wide-eyed pride
Sacks are heavy but his smile never fades
Guided by the moonlight through the snowy glades
Midnight stroke but he's still afloat
With every twist and turn the magic he'll invoke
Time's running thin but he won't give in
Holiday joy rides on every day
Joy rides on every gust of wind
Midnight's stroke, but he's still afloat
