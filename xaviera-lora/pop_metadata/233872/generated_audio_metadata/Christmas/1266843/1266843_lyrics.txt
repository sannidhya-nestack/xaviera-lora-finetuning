The lights of Christmas time are glowing
Snowflakes falling soft and white
But what really warms my heart is knowing
You'll be here tonight
By the tree on the mistletoe waiting
Just to say you'll always be mine
Christmas means I can stay with you
In your arms where dreams come true
We'll laugh and whisper by the fire
Stockings hung in a cozy robe
Every gift wrapped with affection
In the sweetest love we'll ever know
The world outside is cold and bare
But with you its summers glow
Christmas means I can stay with you
In your arms where dreams come true
The stars are shining bright above
This season's magic filled with love
Let's cherish every moment dear
Holding you my Christmas cheer
Christmas means I can stay with you
In your arms where dreams come true
