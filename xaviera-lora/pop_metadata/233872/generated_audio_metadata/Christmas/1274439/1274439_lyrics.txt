Come, they told me, pa-dum-pa-pum-pum
A newborn king to see, pa-dum-pa-pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa-dum-pa-pum pum
Too late before the king
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
So to honor him
Pa rum pum pum pum
When we come
Baby Jesus, pa-da-pa-pum-pum
I am a poor girl too, pa-da-pa-pum-pum
I have no gift to bring, pa-da-pa-pum-pum
That's it to get our king
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Shall I play for you
Pa rum pum pum pum
On my drum
Very naughty, pa-dum-pa-pum-pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa-dum-pa-pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa-dum-pa-pum pum
I played my best for him
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Then he smiled at me
Pa rum pum pum pum
Me and my drum
