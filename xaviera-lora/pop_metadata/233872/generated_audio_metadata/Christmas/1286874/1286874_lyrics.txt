Glitter coats they evergreen
Snowflakes make a silver sing
Red and green the colors clash
In the glow of festive flash
Santa's got a brand new hat
Lookin' chic, imagine that
Elves just strut like you're on stage
Present wrappings all the rage
Check the halls in style all right
Sparkling like stars tonight
Kayleigh sweaters feel just right
Fashion's never been so bright
Candy canes in every hand
Pearl white boots that take a stand
Mrs. Claus she leads the show
Mistletoe on velvet bows
Reindeer prints in silver heels
Jingle bells that spin like wheels
Ice like diamonds in the light
Night time turns to fashion's flight
Deck the halls in style all right
Sparkling like stars tonight
Daily sweaters feel just right
Fashion's never been so bright
Cranky pants and silver heels
Jingle bells that spin like wheels
Ice like diamonds in the light
Night time turns to fashion's flight
Deck the halls in style all right
Sparkling like stars tonight
Gaily sweaters feel just right
Fashion's never been so bright
