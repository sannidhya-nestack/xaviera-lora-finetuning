Just another Christmas with one lost girl
On this supposed day of cheer
Her silent pain is all you'll hear
Just another Christmas and one lost girl
She falls asleep with a prayer
A girl whose life never started
Hoping for better days
For her family that's lost its way
She looks at her ceiling and just stares
And all he knows is the rage and pain
From the violent hand he must endure
Wondering when it all will ever end
Praying to God to explain
Here's his parents fighting again
Just another Christmas with one lost boy
Nothing on this day to enjoy
No love behind any kiss
Just another Christmas
And one lost boy
To kids who will never be kids
Life's journey doles out their pain
Their empty laugh and broken hearts
The shattered dreams and false hopes
Storms always bring them rain
Just another Christmas with two lost kids
Just a house without care
In need of the Lord's prayer
Just another Christmas with two lost kids
Another lost Christmas
Oh, oh, oh
Just another Christmas
