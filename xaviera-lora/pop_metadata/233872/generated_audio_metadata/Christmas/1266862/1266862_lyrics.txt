All my life I've dreamed of December
Moments of cheer, the season to remember
What I wished for, finally true tonight
When you're near each moment feels tender
Holding your hand, the snowflakes so bright
All that I want is all of this magic light
Christmas joy surrounds every heart
Jingle bells, a season to start
Love and light in every part
Christmas joy surrounds every heart
I love the cheer of you, the smiles we share
Ornaments that shimmer, tinsel in your hair
The snow, the lights, the warmth in the air
Sing carols, a love beyond compare
The fireplace crackles, the world's aglow
Sharing this love is all I need to know
Christmas joy surrounds every heart
Jingle bells, a season to start
Love bells, love bells, can it be found?
Christmas joy surrounds every heart
Through this night I'll hold you tight
There's a cheer every star shines bright
Look in the dirt sun's lighting in it
Ooh, my feet is shipped, singing
Love is resounding in our hearts
It's a joy that's felt at the end
Shin-bu-ra-ja-ji-ra
Love and light in every heart
Christmas joy surrounds every heart
