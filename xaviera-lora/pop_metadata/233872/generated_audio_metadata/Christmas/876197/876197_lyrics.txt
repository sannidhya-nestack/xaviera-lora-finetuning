How far to Bethlehem, not very far
Shall we find the stable room lit by a star
Can we see the little child, is he within
If we lift the wooden latch, may we go in
May we stroke the creatures, their oxen and sheep
May we watch like them and see Jesus asleep
If we touch his tiny hand, will he awake?
Will he know we've come so far just for his sake?
Great kings have precious gifts and we have not
Little smiles and little tears are all we brought
For our weary little children very must weep
Here upon his bed of straw, sleep children sleep, sleep children sleep, sleep children sleep
