While by my sheep I watched at night
Glad tidings brought an angel bright
How great my joy
Joy joy joy
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high
There will be born, so he did say
In Bethlehem a child today
How great my joy
Joy joy joy
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high
There He will lie in manger mean
Who will redeem the world from sin
How great my joy
Joy joy joy
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high
While by my sheep I watched at night
Let tidings brought an angel bright
How great my joy
How great my joy
Joy joy joy
Praise be the Lord in heaven on high
I'll create my joy
I'll create my joy
Joy, joy, joy
Joy, joy, joy
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll create my joy
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll create my joy
Praise we the Lord
