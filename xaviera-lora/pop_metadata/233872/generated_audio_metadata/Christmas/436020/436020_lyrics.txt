Sparkling lights and snowflakes
A twinkle in your eye
The crisp cold air that winter brings
It makes me feel so high
Couple strolling arm in arm
They're laughing all the while
Oh that's why, yeah
Christmas makes me smile
Fireplaces snapping, sleighs adorned with bells
The tempting sight of mistletoe and folks dressed up so well
Reading cards in candlelight, a glow on every child
Oh that's why Christmas makes me smile
Oh, the carols fill the air so fine
Love to hear that sound (love to hear that sound)
Anticipating Santa's ride
And the cheerful folks around
The warm and happy feeling flows
As Christmas Day grows near
It's the favorite holiday for all
The best time of the year, dear
Friends and family gather
To brighten up the night
Food and drink and giving thanks
They make the mood so right
All the love the season brings
You see it every mile
Oh that's why
That's why
Oh my
Christmas makes me smile
Ooh, yeah, Christmas makes me smile
