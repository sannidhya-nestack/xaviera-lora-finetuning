Children laughing, bells a-clang
Carols sung, the time must rhyme
Wonderfields, a frosty air
Magic moments everywhere
Snowflakes are falling down
Magic in every town
Christmas will be here soon
Filling our hearts with dew
Snowflakes are falling down
Magic in every town
This Christmas will be his too
Filling our hearts with tune
The lights are glowing bright
Love and joy take flight
Families gather round
Sharing gifts we found
Warmth and laughter in the room
Chasing away the gloom
The lights are glowing bright
Love and joy take flight
Together we'll sing
In a joy-bell's ring
In the clouds she veins we see
The world of endless sight
The glowing bright
Love and joy in sick flight
Together we'll sing
Hear the joy bells ring
