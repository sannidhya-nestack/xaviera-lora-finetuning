I don't care about presents this year
All I need is goodwill and good cheer
And you here with me
I don't need to consume or conflict
All I need is a moonlight
And you here with me
The house smells of pine and we've got the fire
A kiss under mistletoe and a mulled wine choir
you're here with me
Now we're here all alone
Switch off the wifi and turn off your phone
Cause you're here with me
The stars are shining bright, and it looks like snow
Hey wait a minute, what's that reddish glow?
It's Rudolph's red nose
