Sleigh bells ring across the snow
Twisting paths where dreams will go
Footsteps echo and moonlight grow
Whispers dance with the undertow
Scar-bruned stars that never fade
Hope in London by Calvary
Frozen waters thawing straight
In this night where wishes wait
Sleigh bells jingle, dreams come true
Love and laughter, moments new
Magic fills the air we knew
Joy in colours, white and blue
Winter's charm, a wild delight
Every heart in rhythm's flight
Frosted windows catch in sight
Glimmers spark in the night
Happiness in every step
Twinkling lights of joy adept
Smiles on faces as they've crept
Through the night our spirits set
Say those jingle dreams come true
Love and laughter, moments new
Magic fills the air we knew
Joy in colours, bright and blue
