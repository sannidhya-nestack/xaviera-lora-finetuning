The snow is falling and the lights are bright
I'll hold you close on this magical night
We'll share a kiss under the mistletoe
And the wind will blow, oh I know
Christmas time will always shine
With your love the world's divine
Every moment's ours to treasure
Filled with love beyond all measure
Disrupt the fires red-born
In your arms I feel safe from storms
The carols play our hearts true song
All night long we belong alone
Christmas time will always shine
With your love the world's divine
Every moment's ours to treasure
Filled with love beyond all measure
Gifts unwrapped, the fire's lit, warm
In your arms, I feel safe from storms
The carols play, our hearts true song
All night long, where we belong
Do do do do do do do do do do do do
Together we'll drift to this wonderland
With you, everyday is more than fun
Our love like snowflakes in the air
Forever we'll share
Christmas time will always shine
With your love the world's divine
Every moment's ours to treasure
Filled with love beyond all measure
Gifts of rap the fighters lit, worn
In your arms I feel safe from storms
The carols play our hearts true song
All night long where we belong
Gifts unwrapped, the fire's lit warm
In your arms I feel safe from storms
The carols play our hearts through song
All night long where we belong, where we belong
Christmas time will always shine
With your love the world's divine
Every moment ours to treasure
Filled with love beyond all measure
Together we'll dance through this wonderland
With you everyday is more than grand
Our love like snowflakes in the air
Forever we'll share
Forever we'll share
Christmas time will always shine
With your love the world's divine
Every moment's ours to treasure
Filled with love beyond all measure
