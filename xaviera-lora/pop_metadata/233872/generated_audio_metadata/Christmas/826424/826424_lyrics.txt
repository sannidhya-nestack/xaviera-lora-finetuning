Sleigh bells ringing in the air and children singing carols everywhere
Advent calendars are counting down the days to celebrate when hope was born
Candles on the window sill lead loved ones home for winter's holiday
Oh, it's Christmas time
Christmas time is here, it's our favorite time of year
Making merry memories, making merry memories
Christmas time is here, it's our favorite time of year
Making merry memories, making merry memories
Snowball fights in igloo forts
And some frostbite on the tips of my fingers
And hot cocoa
With marshmallows made to melt the icicles from my frozen nose
Christmas lights and stockings hung
On the mantel over the fireplace
And eggnog drink and mistletoe
Helped to spread the joy and the cheerful giving
Christmas time is here, it's our favorite time of year
Making merry memories, making merry memories
Christmas time is here, it's our favorite time of year
Making merry memories, making merry memories
Sledding down the highest mountain at the speed of light
We laugh out loud as we watch our breath in the chill cold air
And wish this moment would last forever
Wish this moment would last forever
Christmas time is here, it's our favorite time of year
Making merry memories, making merry memories
Christmas time is here, it's our favorite time of year
Making merry memories, making merry memories
Christmas time is here, it's our favorite time of year
Making merry memories, making merry memories
Christmas time is here, it's our favorite time of year
Making merry memories, making merry memories
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
