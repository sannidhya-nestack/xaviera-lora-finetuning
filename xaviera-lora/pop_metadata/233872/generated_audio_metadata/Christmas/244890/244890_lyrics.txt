My friends called me a skeptic because I did not believe
That Kris Kringle in his sled brought gifts on Christmas Eve
I was just like Dad and Thomas in need of proof
Until I heard reindeer on the roof
Sleigh bells woke me from my sleep with a ringing in my ears
Then a loud voice bellowed out the names of the reindeer
At first I thought it was a prank, a clever hoax or spoof
The night that I heard reindeer on the roof
How did he know my address?
Did he check his list twice?
How did he know if I was naughty or nice?
Dasher, dancer, prancer
All as if on cue
Rudolph, Comet, Blitz and Vixen
Cupid, Donder too
They pulled the sleigh as it touched down
I heard the sound of hooves
I swear that there were reindeer on the roof
The night that I heard reindeer on the roof
That night I heard reindeer on the roof
