What is it about the holidays
That make people act so nice
Do we talk about our visions
And not politics and religions
Do we respect each other's opinions
And don't listen to the minions
But is it just a show
To keep the energy flowing
Do we keep what's really inside to mask the feelings they provide
What is it about the holidays that changes how we think
We hope it will be more than a nod and a wink
Are we just prisoners in a pretend world of glee
Or could it transcend to help society
We're always disappointed when the holidays end
We have such high hopes in which so many depend
But attitudes change slowly
But never give up in the end
What is it about the holidays
That changes how we think
We hope it will be more than a nod and a wink
What is it about the holidays that changes how we think
We hope it will be more than a nod and a wink
What is it about the holidays that changes how we think
We hope it will be more than a knot in a wing
Than a knot in a wing
