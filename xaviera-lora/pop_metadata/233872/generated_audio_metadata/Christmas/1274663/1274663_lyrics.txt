Candles flicker in the wind of fate
Whispers of warmth call your name
The world outside fades to a quiet hum
As our hearts play a gentle drum
On this Christmas night, it's so divine
Every breath feels like a sign
Wrapped in love, soft and bright
You and I under the starry light
Through evergreen setting fires glow
A story unfolds, sweet and slow
You're the reason joy feels so near
The magic's real when you are here
On this Christmas night
The soul divine
Every breath feels like a sign
Wrapped in love
Soft and bright
You and I under the starry light
Through evergreen scent and fire's glow
A story unfolds sweet and slow
You're the reason joy feels so near
The magic's real when you are here
On this Christmas night so divine
Every breath feels like a sign
Wrapped in love, soft and right
You and I under the starry night
No words needed, just your hand in mine
Our souls dancing perfect in time
Every wish I've kept inside
Is feel you on the silent ride
On this Christmas night
So disordered and fine
Every breath feels like a sign (like a sign)
Wrapped in love, soft and soft and bright
You and I under the starry light
Ooh, so let's stay here
Let's hold it tight
Our love's shining through the night
It's Christmas, all I need is clear
You're the gift I hold most dear
No words needed, just your hand in mine
Our souls dancing perfect in time
Every wish I've kept inside
Is here with you on this silent ride
