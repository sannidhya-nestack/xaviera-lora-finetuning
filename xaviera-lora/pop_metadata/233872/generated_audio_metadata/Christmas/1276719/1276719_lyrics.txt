Snowflakes dance on silent streets
Jingle bells and festive beats
Horses pulling sleighs of gold
Stories of the times of old
In the air, a joyful song
Christmas spirit all night long
Jingle bell goes crisp and clear
Bringing magic far and near
In this melody hearts find cheer
Christmas joy throughout the years
Icicles on window panes
Laughter in the snowy lanes
Children's eyes with wonder bright
Gifts exchanged by firelight
In the air, a joyful song
Christmas spirit all night long
Jingle bell goes crisp and clear
Bringing magic far and near
In this melody hearts find cheer
Christmas joy throughout the year
Candles flicker in the dark
Guiding us with fairy lanes
Wishes whisper to the sky
Hope and love will never die
Jingle bell goes crisp and clear
Bringing magic far and near
In this melody hearts find cheer
Christmas joy throughout the year
Candles flicker in the dark
Guiding us with their best spark
Wishes whisper to the sky
Hope and love will never die
