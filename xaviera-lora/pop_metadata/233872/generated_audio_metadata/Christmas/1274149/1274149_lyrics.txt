Snow is falling soft and white
Blankets in this silent night
Families gathered by the fire
Sharing dreams and hearts desire
Feel the warmth and hear the song
In this place where we belong
Winter's warm embrace tonight
Fills our hearts with pure delight
In this season love will trace
Every smile, every face, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Candles flicker, shadows play
Memories of Christmas Day
Sweet aromas fill the air
Joy and laughter everywhere
Feel the warmth and hear the song
In this place where we belong
Winter's warm embrace tonight
Fills our hearts with pure delight
In this season love will trace
Every smile, every face
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Underneath the moonlit sky
With you here, time flies by
Every hug, a promise made
And this love will never fade
Oh, winter's warm embrace tonight
Fills our hearts with pure delight
In this season love will trace (love will trace)
Every smile, every face (every face)
Oh, every smile, every face
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
