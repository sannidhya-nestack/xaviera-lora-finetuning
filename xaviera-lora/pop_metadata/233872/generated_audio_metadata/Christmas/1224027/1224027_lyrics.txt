Is it just me or could it be you?
Are we two lonely people with nothing better to do?
Whether it's fate or just circumstance
Could you use a little Christmas romance?
It could be us
Dancing real slow
Maybe we'll pause for a while under the mistletoe
Whether it's fate or simply a dance
I could use a little Christmas romance
Too many things are often left unsaid
It's more than the eggnog that's gone to my head
Too many things are often left unsaid
It's more than the eggnog that's gone to my head
Let it be me, loving on you
Maybe we'll make it through the new year
I'm hoping that we do
Let's call it fate
Let's take a chance
Honey we both need a little Christmas romance
Even Santa needs a little Christmas romance
