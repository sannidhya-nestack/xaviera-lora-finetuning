Flakes drift slowly past the calf class
Brushes whisper time making shadows dance
Your scarf unties a winter made of brass
And laughter curls like steam from both our hands
Piano warms the room in amber tones
An upright heart goes walking under words
You shake the cold from your woolen coat
And every note turns softer than a bird
Outside the world is silver still and white
But in here everything turns honey gold
The melodies remember long ago
And somehow make the present feel like home
Let the snow be a hush on the street
We'll keep our rhythm in a low warm beat
Leaning close while the candles shine
Tonight this Christmas feels like yours and mine
A tiny star hangs over the tip jar light
Saxophone sighs like smoke in velvet air
The trumpet sends a kiss at the end of the night
And strings drift by like tinsel in your hair
We trade small stories like vinyl sights
Flip the moment, hear another tune
Your smile finds the measure of my mind
And every sip tastes sweeter than the moon
The window paints our silhouettes in frost
Two notes tied together slow and true
The old time porous floats across the room
And all I want is simply more of you
Let the snow be a hush on the street
We'll keep our rhythm in a low warm beat
Leaning close while the candles shine
Tonight this Christmas feels like yours and mine
Let the needle find its quiet groove
While clocks et to count the hours through
Footsteps ring like sleigh bells down the block
As time unlaces all it thought it knew
If there are gifts I'll open up tonight
They're small and perfect, just your hand in mine
Your cheek against my cheek, the softest light
A promise wrapped in ribbon, tender time
Let the snow be a hush on the street
We'll keep our rhythm in a low warm beat
Leaning close while the candles shine
Tonight this Christmas feels like yours and mine
So let's walk slow beneath the winter sun
Leave footprints where the quiet corners rhyme
The door shuts out the wind and in the glow
This gentle swing will follow where we go
