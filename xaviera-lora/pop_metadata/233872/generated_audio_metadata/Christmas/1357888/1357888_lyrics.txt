Door chime murmurs, winter hums the avenue
Window fog draws halos round the both of us two
Coats on a chair and the night shakes off its chill
Brushed drums whisper like snow, learning to be still
Piano paints the room in candle golden hue
Your smile warms the corners, daylight never new
Outside the city shuffle, soft and slow
A sack somewhere sighs low, what words won't show
My hand finds yours, the rhythm finds our feet
In this small cafe, December's heartbeat
Swing me gently through the hush of Christmas time
Every sip a rhyme, every glance a chime
Let the snowfall keep its meter well keep ours entwined
Darling in this cozy light
Your shoulder against mine, old songs breathing velvet wearing stars like lace
Slow Christmas hold me in your warm embrace
Steam curls from cocoa, cinnamon brave and bright
A bell from the street drifts in, moon pale and light
Crackle from the corner where the needle greets the groove
Shadows slow dance on the wall, too shy to make a move
You laugh and for a moment all the years grow thin
The past pulls up a chair and quietly sits in
Every note hangs tender as the mistletoe
Your name tastes like winter cherries sweet and low
The world outside can wander anywhere it please
Here we waltz on coffee steam and whisper melodies
Swing me gently through the hush of Christmas time
Every sip a rhyme, every glance a chime
Let the snow fall, keep its meter well, keep ours entwined
Darling in this cozy light, your shoulder against mine
Under paper stars and paints that bloom with frost
We find the future in the kindness we once lost
Once a radio in grandma's parlor kept its time
Silver branches trembled as the crooners softly shined
I never knew the spell until I heard you hum a -<|28.08|>
Suddenly it's 59 and every word's a song
If love has a needle, let it find the groove we're in
And circle'round forever'til the last good night begins
Ooh
Ooh, swing me gently through the hush of Christmas time
Let the quiet bells align, our breath, our rhyme
While let the snow write postcards on the glass outside
While we write promises we never have to hide
Old songs keep us warmer than the candles flame can do
Slow Christmas darling, I am home with you
Streetlights yawn, the night pours out its blues
We pay the check with whispers
And keep the evenings clues
