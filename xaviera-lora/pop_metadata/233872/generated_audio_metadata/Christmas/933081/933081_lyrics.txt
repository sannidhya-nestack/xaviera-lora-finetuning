Ready to sing? Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh
Oh, the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob tail ring
Making spirit bright
What fun it is to ride and sing this lame song tonight
Jingle bells, j-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, j-j-j-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what a lot of fun, what a lot of fun to ride and sing in a one horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow (she is dashing)
And a one-horse open sleigh (one-horse sleigh)
Over the fields we go (over the fields we go, we go)
Laughing all the way
Bells on the tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what a fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what a fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Ba ba la la la, ba ba la la la
Ba-ba-la-la-la-la, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Wa-ba-ba-ba-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da
Doodle-a-doodle-a, doodle-a-doodle-ay, doodle-oo, day, doodle-oo
Boodle-oodle-ay, hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells
Oh, what fun it is to walk past someone's sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
