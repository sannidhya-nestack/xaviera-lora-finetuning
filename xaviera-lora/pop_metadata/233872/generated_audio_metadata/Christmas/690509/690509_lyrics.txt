God rest you merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior was born on
Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Tidings of comfort and joy
In Bethlehem in Jewry
This blessed babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The witch, his mother Mary
Did nothing, taking scorn
Oh tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
Lightings of comfort and joy
