The holly and the ivy
When they are both full grown
Upon the trees that are green
The hearty bears the crown for the rising of the sun and the running of the deer
The playing of the merry an, sweet singing in the park
The honey bears a blossom as white as any flower
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to be our sweet Savior
Oh, the holly and the ivy
When they are both full grown
Of all the trees that are aged
The holly bears the crown
The holly bears the crown
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The honey and the ivy, they are both the growth of all the trees that are in the wood
The honeybees are rising up the sun, burning up the deer, the pain of the an
Sweet singing in the clouds (in the clouds)
Hearty bears are blossomed (oh)
As white as any flower
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ (sweet Jesus Christ)
To be our sweet Saviour
The party at the island (the party at the island)
Where they are both full grown (full grown)
Of all the trees that are in the wood
The hearty bears are crowned
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! (Beep, beep, beep)
The holly bears a blossom
As white as any flower
And every poor sweet Jesus Christ
Used to be a sweet savior
The rising of the sun
The running of the deer
The painting of the an
Sweet singing in the choir
Of all the trees that are in the wood
The holly bears the crown
