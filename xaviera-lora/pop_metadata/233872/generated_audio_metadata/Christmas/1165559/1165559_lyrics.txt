Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Seen a thousand Christmas lights
They don't shine half as bright as you
I've opened up a hundred gifts
But never found the joy you give, it's true
It's never the same, oh same
As long as you're here, babe
You make every Christmas feel like the first Christmas
It's always something new
Oh, when I'm wrapped up with you
I'm caught in a wonderland
Every time you take my hand
Don't know how you do what you do
Making every Christmas like the first Christmas with you, you
Nobody turns my jolly up
Puts the cocoa in my cup like you
Carols that I know by heart
If I'm anywhere you are it's a different
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
You make every Christmas feel like the
First Christmas, it's always something new
Oh, when I'm wrapped up with you
I'm caught in a wonderland
Every time you take my hand
Don't know how you do what you do
Making every Christmas like
The first Christmas with you, you
It's never the same, oh say
As long as you're here, babe
You make every Christmas feel like the first Christmas
It's always something new
Oh, when I'm wrapped up with you
I'm caught in a wonderland
Every time you take my hand
Darling, keep on doing what you do
Making every Christmas like
The first Christmas with you, you
Oh, the first Christmas with you
