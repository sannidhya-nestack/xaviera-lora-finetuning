Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to our newborn King
His honor and mercy bound
All else seen has dead or found
Joyfully he reigns
With your jade voice proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Christ, my heart, as death adored, Christ, the everlasting Lord,
Raised in time behold him come, Offspring of a virgin's womb.
Jesus, man with man to dwell
Jesus, our Emmanuel
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Hail, the Heavenly King
O Prince of Peace, hail, O Son of God! (Light and justice)
Light and life, all He brings, is within His wings
And in this his glory by
Long has been the glory done
All to his own sons of man
All to his second man
And the heaven and the earth sing
L'un et l'autre, l'un d'entre eux.
