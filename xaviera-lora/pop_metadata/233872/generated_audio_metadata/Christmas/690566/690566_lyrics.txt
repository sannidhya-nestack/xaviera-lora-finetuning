O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him, born the King of angels
O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord
Christ the Lord
Come, come all ye faithful
Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above
Glory to God in the highest
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Christ the Lord
Yea, Lord, we greet Thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus, to Thee be glory given
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ
Oh come let us adore Him, oh come let us adore Him, oh come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord
Christ the Lord
Come and behold Him
Come all ye faithful
Christ the Lord
Come all ye faithful
Come
Christ the Lord
