There's a jingle in the air tonight
Sleigh bells ringing, oh what a sight
Hop on now we're taking flight
Through the snow and twinkling light
Frosty windows and street lights glow
Feel the magic as we ride through snow
Warm cocoa in our hands to show
The joy of Christmas heart to toe
Hop on the Christmas sleigh let's go
Through the winter wonderland we flow
With laughter and cheer we'll steal the show
Dancing with the stars that glow
Snowflakes falling, they kiss our cheeks
As we glide through this magical streak
Whispers of joy in the nippy breeze
Christmas carols sung with ease
Tinsel's glimmering on every tree
Children's laughter setting spirits free
Together we make this memory
A time of love and harmony
Hop on the Christmas sleigh, let's go
Through the winter wonderland we float
With laugh and cheer we'll steal the show
Dancing with the stars that glow
