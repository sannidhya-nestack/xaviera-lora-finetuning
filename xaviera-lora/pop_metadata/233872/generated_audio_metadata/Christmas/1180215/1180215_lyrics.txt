Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Shepherd's widest jubilee
Why your joyous strains prolong
What the glad sometimes be
Which inspire your heavenly song
Oh oh oh oh oh
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing
Commodore abandoned me
Christ the Lord, the newborn King, Lord
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
In excelsis Deo
In excelsis Deo
