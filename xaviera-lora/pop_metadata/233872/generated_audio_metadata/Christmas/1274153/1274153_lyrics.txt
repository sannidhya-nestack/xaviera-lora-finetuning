Mm, mm, mm
Snowflakes fall in city lights are glowed
Wrapped up on nowhere to go
Just you and me on Christmas Eve
Creating memories I won't believe
The fire's crackling, ornaments shine
Your eyes are sparkling, you're all mine
Perfect gift is standing here
My Christmas wish came true this year
Mistletoe magic in the air tonight
Holding you close everything's right
Jingle bells ring but I only hear
The beating of your heart my dear
This Christmas love is crystal clear
Under the mistletoe no fear
Cookies bake and carols play so soft
Your gentle touch, my heart aloft
We dance so slow, lost in the glow of candlelight and fall of snow
The world outside can wait a while
I'm caught up in your winter smile
No other gift could mean as much
As your sweet kiss and tender touch
Mistletoe magic in the air tonight
Holding you close everything's right
Jingle bells ring but I only hear
The beating of your heart my dear
This Christmas love is crystal clear
Under the mistletoe no fear
Under the mistletoe, no fear
Let's make a wish upon the stars
That this moment lasts near and far
Forever and always, you and me
Our own Christmas love story
Mistletoe magic in the air tonight (air tonight)
Holding you close everything's right
Jingle bells ring but I only hear
The beating of your heart my dear
This Christmas love is crystal clear
Under the mistletoe no fear
Merry Christmas my love
