Oh, the snow is gently falling As the tinsel starts to gleam
The world is soft and calling To a wintertime dream
With a dance around the fire And a twinkle in each eye
Our spirits climbing higher'Neath the glittering sky
Singing through the season with lights that never fade
Every joyful reason in melodies we've made
Jingle bells are ringing with a jazzy little twist
See the stars they're singing, we'll get lost in this
Playful tunes echo brightly in the frosty evening air
Hold your lover tightly, feel the magic everywhere
Sip hot cocoa warm and sweet by the fires glow will stay
Every heartbeat, every beat will laugh and softly sway
Swinging through the season with lights that never fade
Every joyful reason in melodies we've made
Jingle bells are ringing with a jazzy little twist
See the stars they're singing, we'll get lost in this
Playful tunes echo brightly in the frosty evening air
Hold your lover tightly, feel the magic everywhere
Sip hot cocoa, warm and sweet by the fires glow will stay
Every heartbeat, every beat will laugh and softly sway
