It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold
He sold the earth, goodwill toward men
From the heavens, O gracious King
The world in solemn stillness relayed
To hear the angels
Sing
The cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurled
And over all the weary world
Heavenly music flows, flows on
For lo, the days are hastening on
By prophets seen of old
When with the ever-circling years
Shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth
Shall own the Prince of Peace, their King
And the whole world sent back the song
Which now the angels sing
It came upon
On the nightcliff
