Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Silent night, the world asleep
Frosty stars, a sky so deep
Evergreens in pure white snow
Twinkling lights that softly glow
In the stillness, hear the song
Echoes of where we belong
Evergreen harmony, pure and bright
Singing through the winter night
In the seasons, tender grace
Love and joy in every place
Mm-hmm
Crackling fires, cozy cheer
Songs of you that draw us near
Hushed carols by the fireside
With loved ones close, side by side
In the stillness, hear the song
Echoes of where we belong
Evergreen harmony pure and bright
Singing through the winter night
In this seasons tender grace
Love and joy in every place
Mmm, snowflakes, walls, a dance so light
Casting dreams in silent night
Underneath the mistletoe
Whispers soft, love's gentle glow in the green
Harmony, pure and bright
Singing through the winter night
Endless seasons, tender grace
Love and joy in every place
Snowflakes, walls, a dance so light
Casting dreams in silent night
Underneath the mistletoe
Whispers soft, love's gentle glow
