Holy berries, red and bright
Adorn our homes on Christmas night
Mistletoe hung in a hall
Waiting for love's gentle call
In the hush of winter's glow
Every heart begins to glow
Holly and mistletoe, pure delight
Bringing magic to the night
In their presence love will grow
Underneath the mistletoe
Fireplaces crackle on
Shielding us from winter's storm
Stories told by candlelight
Wrapped in blankets holding tight
In the hush of winter's glow
Every heart begins to know
How the end is so tall
Pure delight
Bringing magic to the night
In their presence love will grow
Underneath in this old town
Snowflakes fall soft by the light
In the glow of holiday
Whispers soft and kisses sweet
Where our hearts and souls meet
Holly and mistletoe, pure delight
Bringing magic to the night
In their presence love will grow
Underneath the mistletoe
Snowflakes fall, a soft ballet
In the glow of holiday
Whispers soft and kisses sweet
Where our hearts and souls meet
Holly and mistletoe, pure delight
Bringing magic to the night
In their presence love will grow
Underneath them they're so tall
