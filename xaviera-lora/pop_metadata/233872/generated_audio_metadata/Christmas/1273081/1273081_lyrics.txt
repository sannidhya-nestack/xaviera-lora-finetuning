Snow is drifting soft and light Stars are shining oh so bright
Families gathered hearts aglow Sharing love we all bestow
Every wish upon a star Brings us closer near or far
Holiday dreams come true tonight
Filled with love and pure delight
Hold me close, the season's near
Christmas time is full of cheer
Candy canes and stockings hung
Songs of joy by children sung
Warmth and laughter fill the room
Chasing away winter's gloom
Every wish upon a star
Brings us closer near or far
Holiday dreams come true tonight
Filled with love and pure delight
Hold me close, the season's near
Christmas time is full of cheer
Through the years and through the miles
Memories bring endless smiles
In our hearts the love will stay
Guiding us on Christmas day
Holiday dreams come true tonight
Filled with love and pure delight
Hold me close, the season's near
Christmas time is full of cheer
Through the years and through the miles
Memories bring endless smiles
In our hearts the love will stay
Guiding us on Christmas day
Cruelest day, ooh, ooh
Ooh, as the snowflakes kiss the ground
Christmas joy is all around
Holiday dreams come true tonight
Filled with love and pure delight
Hold me close, the season's near
Christmas time is full of cheer
Through the years and through the miles (through the miles)
Memories bring endless smiles (endless smiles)
In our hearts the love will stay
Guiding us on Christmas day
And it's full of cheer, ooh-ooh-ooh
For the years and through the miles, ooh-ooh-ooh
Through the miles, ooh-ooh-ooh
Memories bring us smiles, ooh-ooh-ooh
For the Christmas day
