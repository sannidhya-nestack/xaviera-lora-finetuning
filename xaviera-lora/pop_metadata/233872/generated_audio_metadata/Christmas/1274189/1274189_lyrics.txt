Bells are chiming, crisp and clear
Welcoming the seasons cheer
Holly wreaths on every door
Christmas magic to explore
Laughter echoes through the halls
As the snow so gently falls
Holly and heart strings intertwined
In this season love we find
Glimmering lights and mistletoe
In this warmth our spirits grow
Candied apple cider sweet
Snowflakes dancing on the street
Children's eyes are filled with glee
Unwrapping dreams beneath the tree
Laughter echoes through the halls
As the snow so gently falls
Holly and hot strings intertwine
In this season love we find
Glimmering lights and mistletoe
In this warmth our spirits grow
Candied apples, cider sweet
Snowflakes dancing on the street
Children's eyes are filled with gleam
Unwrapping dreams beneath the tree
Through the frost and winter chill
Every heart with love we fill
Carol sung by firelight
Binding us on this night
Holly and heart strings intertwine
In this season love we find
Glimmering lights and mistletoe
In this warmth our spirits grow
Crams and ribbons both so tight
Tints of gleams and soft moonlight
Memories made old and new
Christmas joy in all we do
