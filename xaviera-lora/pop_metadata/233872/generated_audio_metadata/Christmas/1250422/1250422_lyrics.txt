Dancing'round the lights, sparkling with glee
Snowflakes falling softly by the Christmas tree
Warm smiles all around
Hearts so full and free
Laughter fills the room
By the Christmas tree
Oh let's dance, dance, dance
By the twinkling tree
With joy, joy, joy
Together you and me
Oh let's float, let's sway
All night through the glee
In this magic moment
By the Christmas tree
Oh-oh-oh
Oh let's dance, dance, dance
By the twinkling tree
With joy, joy, joy
Together you and me
Oh let's swoon, let's sway
All night through the glee
In this magic moment
By the Christmas tree
Gifts wrapped in love
Underneath the pine
Humming all our favorite tunes
Feeling so divine
Lights are shining bright
Candles in the night
Holding hands so tight
Everything's alright
Voices blend in cheer
Silent night so near
In each other's arms
Nothing more to fear
Lights are shining bright
Candles in the night
Holding hands so tight
Everything's alright
Voices blend in cheer
Silent nights so near
In each other's arms
Nothing more to fear
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Voices blend in cheer, silent night so near
In each other's arms nothing more to fear
