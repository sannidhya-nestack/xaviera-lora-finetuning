On the moonlit skies I start my day
I dance with rags to clean the slate
These bells must shine so Santa stays
His magic rides on gleaming rays
In the workshop shadows fall
I polish each and every call
With a step and a twirl
I make them bright for Santa's sleigh
On Christmas night
Bells of the sleigh hear them ring
Shining bright in the air they sing
Every note a sparkle light
Guiding Santa through the night
Ain't sad'til through the night
With a broom I glide and swing
Making sure the bells all ring
A dance that echoes winter's tune
Underneath the frosty moon
While the reindeer rest they soar
Sleigh bells shimmer even more
Counting stars I do my part
Clinging bells straight from the heart
Bells of the sleigh hear them ring
Shining bright in the air they sing
Every note a sparkle like
Guiding Santa through the night
Guiding Santa through the night
Guiding Santa through the night
