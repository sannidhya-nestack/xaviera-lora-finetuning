Snowy nights, a tranquil glow
Footsteps crunching soft and slow
Lanterns light the cobblestone
Walking through this world alone
In the quiet hear the sound
Christmas magic all around
Snowy nights and silence
Whispers echoing in the winter air
Hearts so warmed by love's sweet flicker
Christmas time is everywhere
Fireplaces cozy gleam
Children lost in yuletide dreams
Icicles that catch the light
Turning darkness into bright
In the quiet hear the sound
Christmas magic all around
Snowy nights and silent whispers
Echoing in the winter air
Hearts so warmed by love's sweet flicker
Christmas time is everywhere
Frosty
Windows, frosty haze
Drawing hearts with tiny hands
Underneath the mistletoe
Lovers kissing, moonlight glow
Snowy nights and silent whispers
Echoing in the winter air
Hearts so warmed by love's sweet flicker
Christmas time is everywhere
