Days getting short, nights even colder
Another year down, another year older
Now that Santa Claus has captured the kids
Brace yourself for the media blitz
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, Happy Hanukkah too
Be you Christian, Agnostic, Muslim or Jew
I wanna say
Happy Holiday
Can't go to the mall, I'm afraid of stampede
Besides, I know the best gifts are free
Working hard to please the names on my list
My stocks took the plunge, so this song is your gift
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, Happy Kwanzaa too
Be you Mormon, Australian or a Hindu
I wanna say Happy Holiday
Bill O'Reilly is going berserk about the war on Christmas by the liberal jerks
Taking Christ out of our Christmas beliefs
But would Jesus go shopping in an SUV?
Maybe they're right, let's get back to the roots
Before Santa Claus and Macy's got in cahoots
Christmas traditions were started by pagans
Long before the exploitation
Merry Christmas, Happy Solstice, Saturnalia too
Be a druid, pantheist, or something new I wanna say
Happy Holiday
Is it safe to say
Happy Holiday
