La la la la, la la la la la la, la la la la, la la la la, oh, oh, oh
Oh Christmas time, oh Christmas time
With twinkling lights so bright
We decorate our big green tree on this joyous silent night
Jingle bells and candy canes
Santa sleigh and reindeer games
Gather round and sing with me
A Christmas song filled with glee
Around the fireplace we gather close
With hot cocoa in our hands
We share stories, laugh and cheer
In this festive holiday land
Jingle bells and candy canes
Santa's sleigh and reindeer games
Join our hearts and sing with glee
For the beauty of Christmas you see
A time of love, a time of joy
Oh, what a wonderful sight
Goodnight my dear, goodnight
And to all a merry Christmas night
