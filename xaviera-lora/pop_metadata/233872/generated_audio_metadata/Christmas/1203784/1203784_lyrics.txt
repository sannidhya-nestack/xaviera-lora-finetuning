Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
It sings a love song as we stroll along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?"
We'll say, "No, man, but you can do the job when you're in town later on"
We'll conspire as we dream by the fire
To be unafraid of the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Wonderland
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter
Wonderland
