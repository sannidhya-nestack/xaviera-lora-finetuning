Hey, little dog, what'll it do?
We got a rope to spread some cheer
Slide down sure is nice and slick
Quicker than a ringer kick
Polish those toys, get them bright
We're gonna work through the night
Avoid the soap, keep it clean
Make it smooth like a dream
Shimmy trips all night long
Dance to Santa's trusty song
Up and down without a hitch
How's it working life or glitch?
Stockings hung up by the fire
Fulfill each kid's heart's desire
Candy canes and little cars
Dollhouse dreams and shooting stars
So some magic in the mix
Make the lights do crazy tricks
Every homeless growing gleam
Set us playing it's quite the scheme
Hails don't stop, keep the beat
We gotta make this season sweet
Glad don't you lose with the mess
Leave these home in happiness
Stockings hung up by the fire
Fulfill each kid's heart's desire
Candy canes and little cars
Dollhouse dreams and shooting stars
Stockings hung up by the fire
Fulfill each kid's heart's desire
Candy canes and little cars
Dollhouse dreams and shooting stars
Stockings hung up by the fire fulfill each kid's heart's desire
The candy canes and little cars
Dollhouse dreams and sugar stars
Throw some magic in the mix
Make the lights do crazy tricks
Every home must glow and gleam
Sample's brand is quite the scheme
Hey elves don't stop keep the beat
We gotta make this season sweet
Glide down chimneys with finesse
Leave each home in happiness
We
