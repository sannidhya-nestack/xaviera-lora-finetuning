Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow in one horse open sleigh
Through the fields we go laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Ooh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Betty Bright
Was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lame
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank and then
We got upside-ee-oo-oh jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way, oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this slaying song
Jump up and up, up'til bay
Two forty at his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack
You'll take the lead on
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Shippa-shupa-tupa-bo
What fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, oh
Jingle bells
Doo-doo-doo-doo-dwee
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
