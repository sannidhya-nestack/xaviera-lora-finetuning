The first Noel
The angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields where they lay
Tending their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east
Beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King
Born is the King
Born is the King of Israel
He was born, Noel
Shalom, shalom, the King of Israel
Noel, the first Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Nowhere
Oh
