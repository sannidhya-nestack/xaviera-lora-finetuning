Sleigh bells ringing, time to get down
Santa's in the groove all over town
Green deer prancing, doing the shimmy
Get your nog, let's make it creamy
Pop up that sleigh bell, let it fly high
Jingle jangle all through the sky
Break it down, feel the holiday cheer
Swing that gift sack, the party's here
Jack Frost nipping at your fucking nose
Toasted marshmallows over the groove we chose
Fucking shimmy on the fireplace
As long as we boogie there ain't no space
Pump up that, that sling bell, let it fly high
Jingle, jangle all through the sky
Break it down, feel the holiday cheer
Swing that gift sack, the party's here
Let's go! Snowflakes dancing, twirling in the night (oh yeah)
Electric lights make the season bright (shine)
Candy canes and gingerbread delight (mm-mm)
Swinging'round that tree, it's feeling right
Pop up that sleigh bell, let it fly high (come on)
Jingle, jangle all through the sky
Break it down, feel the holiday cheer
Swing that gift sack, the party's here (yeah)
Snowflakes dancing, twirling in the night (oh yeah)
Electric lights make the season bright (oh)
Candy canes and gingerbread delight (mm-mm)
Swinging round that tree, it's feeling right (oh yeah)
Fuckin' bells, thank you boy
Break it down, feel the holiday cheer
Swing that gift sack, the party's here
