Tiny hats up on their heads, no time to stop
In the workshop they embrace, they make it pop
With a hop and a skip they bring the cheer
Christmas elves, a busy time of year
Jingle bells and laughter fill the air
Candy canes and toys are everywhere
Working hard but having fun night and day
Dancing, swinging in their elf-like way
Oh, the elves are on the move tonight
Making magic, spreading light
Dancing, swing to the morning bright
Elves on the move, what a sight
Little sparkles paint their little shoes
Every time they grapple they can't lose
With a wink and smile they're quick to go
Twinkling eyes and faces all aglow
Ho ho ho there you sent us home
Tiny feet hustle down the hall
Packed with gifts they ride the snowy flight
Elves in action it's a Christmas night
Oh, the elves are on the move tonight
Making magic, spreading light
Dance and swing'til the morning bright
Elves on the move are the sight
