This is for the one I love
And to all the girls who know
Just how I feel
You see, if you're lonely on this Christmas day
At least let your man know, just like I am in this song
That he's being missed, and that your only desire for Christmas is him
I can wish upon a white Christmas day for us two
But I know it will be hard for me while you're away
For right now, I'll take your call
I miss you
If only Santa could bring you here right now
My heart says, boy, this Christmas you won't be here
No kiss from you, no mistletoe
Though my heart will miss you, baby
Deep inside my fire grows (Boy)
The only present I need is you, boy (Boy)
And I don't need you to be wrapped up in a box, no
Boy, I need you here in my arms
Boy,'cause I wanna feel a happy holiday
My heart says, "Oh, this Christmas you won't be here"
No kiss from you, no mistletoe
Though my heart will miss you, baby
Deep inside my fire grows
My heart says oh, you won't be here
No kiss from you, no mistletoe
Though my heart will miss you baby
Deep inside my fire grows
Though it's snowing outside, yes
And the street coverless singing, yeah
On this Christmas Eve might cry
I wish you were here with me, oh
Baby I need you
Baby I want you
And I wish you were here with me boy
On this Christmas, I will miss you
If I could, I would have you here tonight (We would light a fire)
We would light a fire, baby (And we would love each other)
And play our love song, baby (And play our favorite songs)
And hold each other all night, all night (And hold each other all night, all night)
We would light a fire (We would light a fire, baby)
And play a love song, baby (and play our favorite song) and own each other all night, all night
