Frosty mornings, crisp and clear
Christmas time is finally here
Ornaments on branches high
Reflect the twinkle in your eye
In the stillness hear the sound
Magic whispers all around
Christmas star shines so bright
Guiding us through this night
In your glow we find our way
Celebrating Christmas day
Candles flicker, fireside warm
In your arms we weather storms
Laughter echoes, songs we sing
Feeling joy that winter brings
In the stillness hear the sound
Magic whispers all around
Christmas star shines so bright
Guiding us through this night
In your glow we find our way
Celebrating Christmas day
Candles flicker, fireside warm
In your arms we weather storms
Laughter echoes, songs we sing
Feeling joy that winter brings
Endless snowflakes dance on velvet skies
Northern lights a grand surprise
Hand in hand we make a wish
Sealed with every Christmas kiss
Christmas star shines so bright
Guiding us through this night
In your glow we find our way
Celebrating Christmas day
