The window writes in frost again
Street lamps spill their honey rain
Steam curls up from cups we hold
Like little fires against the cold
A brush on skin, the drummers hush
The bass goes walking, not in rush
Piano lays a velvet throw
And every glance says, "Take it slow"
Let the city tiptoe past the glass
Snow will answer where we pass
If time insists on going through
We'll lace it gently, me and you
Stay, don't mind the closing sign
Let the sleigh bells blur outside
In our little room of winter shine
You turn December into wine
Hear the bass take tiny steps
Piano warms the lamplight blue
Christmas learns to whisper here
Every note says I love you
Your scarf still holds the sidewalk chill
Sugar dust the windowsill
Silver spoons make quiet rings
While muted trumpet softly sings
The waitress hums a carol like
String lights swayin' under a light
The way your laughter leans on mine
Like tinsel resting on a pine
Don't go measuring the night
Let the coat stay on the chair
If the taxi paints its light
It can wait out in the air
Stay, don't mind the closing sign
Let the sleigh bells blur outside
In our little room of winter shine
You turn December into wine
Hear the bass take tiny steps
Piano warms the lamplight blue
Christmas learns to whisper here
Every note says "I love you"
Old records in the corner breathe
A tender crackle under wreaths
The needle kisses ears to life
And sets the snow outside to walls
Your hand is keeping time with mine
A metronome of winter wine
We sway between the empty chairs
Two shadows stitching midnight airs
Stay, don't mind the closing sign
Let the sleigh bells blur outside
In our little room of winter shine
You turn December into wine
Hear the bass take tiny steps
Piano warms the lamplight blue
Christmas learns to whisper here
Every note says I love you
A hush of bells, a final sip
Snow applauds with cotton tips
Lock the door on drifting blue
And carry Christmas home in you
