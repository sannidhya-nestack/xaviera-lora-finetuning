All through the days, been thinking about you darling
All through the days, waiting for Christmas morning
I'll miss your laughter, gonna miss your smile
Dear, need to see you darling on this special day
We'll share the joy
Just like when we were kids because
You know, darling, I love you
So we'll do it together
Every Christmas we remember
All the good times we know, darling, every single year
Need to celebrate Christmas with you here, darling
Share the joy and laughter every Christmas Eve
Nights are so cold
Without you near, my darling, cut down the tree
And then we'll gather smiling, I'll miss you dearly
These seasons cheer me, always need you darling
On these festive nights
We'll light the fire, hold you even tighter
We'll exchange wishes under mistletoe
I'll give you sweet kisses, special sweet wishes
Need to celebrate Christmas when I see your glow
Need to celebrate Christmas with you here, darling
Share the joy and laughter every Christmas Eve
