Flip was the smallest Christmas tree in Mr. Biggles' yard
In his dreams he longed to be
The tree that lights up children's hearts
But each year no one chose him
They picked the taller trees
Mr. Biggles said don't worry Flip
One day you'll find your dream
So Flip kept on believin'
He said, "I'll grow and grow"
When Christmas then comes round again
I'll light up bright in someone's home
Each day he pushed his branches high
Got lots of rain and sun
And Flip upgrew the other trees and became the tallest one
When Christmas came, Mr. Biggles said, "Flip, you've grown so tall
Now you're too big to fit inside anybody's house at all"
Flip was broken hearted, his dream would not come true
When the winter snow made Christmas white, Flip was feeling blue
But Flip kept pushing skyward
Every year he grew so large
Until he was the greatest tree
That had ever been in the yard
Then one day Mr. Biggles said
Flip you've got your dream
There's a special place that you can stay
This Christmas down in New York City
When they turn your lights on
Every child will dance with glee
this year, Flip, you're gonna be
The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree
