Jingle bells jazzing in the street
Santa's got some swing in his feet
Snowflakes falling, can't be beat
Holiday rhythm, feel the heat
Attack the halls with beats so fine
Electric lights, a glowing sign
Ornaments that really shine
Swinging Christmas, that's divine
Nutcrackers dancing'round the tree
Candy canes for you and me
Starlit nights as bright as can be
Melodies of mirth and glee
Deck the halls with beats so fine
Electric lights a glowing sign
Ornaments that really shine
Swinging Christmas, that's divine
From rooftops hear the carolers sing
Reindeer hoof beats have a lasting ring
Hot cocoa sip and let it sing
The saint makes sleigh bells in full swing
Attack the halls with beats so fine
Electric lights a glowing sign
Ornaments that really shine
Swinging Christmas that's divine
