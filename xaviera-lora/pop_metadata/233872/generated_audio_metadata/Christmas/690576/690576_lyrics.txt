The Holly and the Ivy
When they are both full grown
Of all the trees that are in the wood
The Holly bears the crown
Oh the Holly
The rising of the sun
And the running of that deer
The playing of the merry an
Sweet singing in the choir
Sweet singing
Sweet singing
Holly bears a blossom
As white as a lily flower
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
To be our sweet Savior
Jesus, Jesus
For Holly bears the berry
As red as any blood
And Mary, most sweet Jesus Christ
To do poor sinners good, yeah
To do poor sinners good
Yeah, she did
The rising of the sun
And the running of the deer
The playing of the merry an
Sweet singing in the choir
The holly and the ivy
When they are both full grown
Of all the trees that are in the wood
The holly bears the crown
Yes, the holly bears the crown
Oh, the holly
And the ivy bears the crown
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
