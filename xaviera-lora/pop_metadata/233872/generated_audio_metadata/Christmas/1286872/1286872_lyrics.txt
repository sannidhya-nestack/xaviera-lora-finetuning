Silent, snowy nights, I'll lock your rings
In the workshop where joy takes wings
Gifts get wrapped with finest care
Magic sparkles everywhere
Chilly winds but our hearts are warm
Building dreams in every form
Tiny hands but mighty cheer
Christmas Eve is drawing near
We are the elves of Christmas time
Sprinkling cheer, crafting lines
Jingle bells that hardly break
Making magic winter night
Toy trains racing, teddy bears hug
Every child gets winter stock
Painting colors bright and grand
With a touch of sleigh command
Reindeer wait in frosty light
Santa's ready for his flight
Midnight whispers, wishes cloak
Love and laughter on his coat
We are the elves of Christmastime
Sprinkling cheer, cropping rhymes
Jingle bells and holly bright
Make your magic winter night
Jingle bells and holly bright
Christmas Eve is drawing near
We are the elves of Christmas time
Sprinkling cheer, crafting rhymes
Jingle bells and holly bright
Making magic win tonight
