The night falls now
The stars gaze now
Down on the wonder that is all love
Quietly, gently look upon
The coming of that moment
When the heavens lit up
To show the way
The night falls now
The stars gaze now
Down on the wonder that is all love
Dream now of that sight
Which is long gone and always to arrive
For the little one is always to come to us
The night falls now
The stars gaze now
Down on the wonder that is all love
We've put prayers into those ears
Fresh have they come from God
Jesus is here, come to stay
The night falls now
The stars gaze now
Down on the wonder that is all love
