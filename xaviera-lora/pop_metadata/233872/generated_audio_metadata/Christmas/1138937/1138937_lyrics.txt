Is it just me, or could it be you?
Are we two lonely people
With nothing better to do
Whether it's fate
Or just circumstance
Could you use a little Christmas romance
It could be us dancing real slow
Maybe we'll pause for a while under the mistletoe
Whether it's fate
Or simply a dance
I could use a little Christmas romance
So often things go unsaid
It's more than just the eggnog that's gone to my head
So often things (so often things) get left unsaid (oh yeah they do)
It's more than the eggnog that's gone to my head
Let it be me (let it be me)
Lovin' on you (lovin' on you)
Maybe we'll make it through the new year
I'm hopin' we do
Let's call it fate (Let's call it fate)
And take a chance
Who'd you use?
A little Christmas romance
Honey, we deserve a Christmas romance
