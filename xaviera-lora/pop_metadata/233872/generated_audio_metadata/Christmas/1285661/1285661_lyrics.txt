Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lights are flashing, snow is falling down
DJ spins the beats, we own this town
Santa's sleigh parked right outside
Tonight we vibe, tonight we ride
Elves are dancing, gifts in hand
Bays so strong you can hardly stand
Rudolph's nose lights up the floor
Christmas time, ask for more
Christmas in the club, we ain't slowin'
Joy and cheer just keeps on flowin'
Raise your glass and let it spill
Holiday love gives the thrill
Mistletoe hangin' from the ceiling
Hearts all racin', what a feelin'
Jingle bells mixed with bass
Santa suit caught the lace
Frosty mountain in the heat
Crowd is moving on their feet
Twinkling lights, everybody sway
It's the most lit holiday
Christmas in the club, green and slow it
Joy and cheer, just keep some flowing
Raise your glass and let it spill
Holiday love gives the thrill
Mistletoe hanging from the ceiling
Hearts all racing, what a feeling
Jingle bells, nice with bass
Santa suit, got the lace
Christmas in the club, we ain't slowing
Joy and cheer just keeps on flowing
Raise your glass and let it spill
Holiday love gives the thrill
Mistletoe hanging from the ceiling
Hearts are racing, what a feeling
Jingle bells, mix with bass
Santa's suit, caught the lace
Better than love, yeah, yeah
Better than love, yeah, yeah
