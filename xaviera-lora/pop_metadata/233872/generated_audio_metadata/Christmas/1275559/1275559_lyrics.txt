Snowflakes shimmer in the air
Crystals sparkling everywhere
Through the streets a silent glow
Magic fills the world below
In the still of winter's grace
We find joy in this place
Crystal night, magic pure and bright
Whispers of a Christmas night
In this wonder hearts unite
Love and laughter in the light
Lanterns lit with golden flame
Each one tells a story's name
Children's laughter, bells that chime
Echoes of a perfect time
In the still of winter's grace
We find joy in this place
Crystal night, magic pure and bright
Whispers of a Christmas night
In this wonder hearts unite
Love and laughter in the light
Frosty patterns on the pane
Memories that will remain
By the tree we gather near
Sharing love and Christmas cheer
In the still of winter's grace
We find joy in this place
Crystal night, magic pure and bright
Whispers of a Christmas night
This wonder hearts unite
Love and laughter in the light
Frosty patterns on the pain
Memories that will remain
By the tree we gather near
Sharing love and Christmas cheer
Ooh, ooh, friend of light, ooh
