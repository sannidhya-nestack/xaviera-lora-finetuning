Snow is falling, the air is crisp
Let's start to cook and wrap the gifts
Scent of pecan pie when we light the Yuletide log
Got ribbons of thyme and fresh egg nog
Happy Christmas time is here
Happy Christmas time
Happy Christmas time of year
Happy Christmas time
Merry feelings and seasons greetings, oh
Happy Christmas
Happy Christmas
Echoing church bells
Warm gingerbread
Boy, we've missed Noel and Santa's sled
Christmas carols in the night
Getting ready for our guests
Outside it's all frosty white
Tomorrow's gonna be the best
Happy Christmas time is here
Happy Christmas time
Happy Christmas time of year
Happy Christmas time
Come on hurry
Don't you worry
Merry feelings and
Season's greetings oh
Happy Christmas
Happy Christmas
