Holidays are here
Seasons greet as we say
Have a great new year
Catching up with your friends
Catch your rearing year
Come and spend the holidays here
Maybe we'll stop by the rink and go skating
Then have some hot chocolate with marshmallows too
As the band plays on cue
How those holidays are here
Seasons green as we say
Have a great new year
Catch it up with your friends
Get your rear in gear
Come and spend the holidays here
Holidays are here
Seasons green as we say
Have a great new year
Catch it up with your friends
Get your rear in gear
Come and spend the holidays here
Yeah those holidays are here
Seasons greet as we say
Have a great new year
Catching up with your friends
Get your rear in gear
Come and spend the holidays here
Holidays are here
Seasons greet as we say
Have a great new year
Catching up with your friends
Get your rear in gear
Come and spend the holidays here
Holidays here
Season's greetings we send
Catching up with your friend
Come and spend the holidays here
