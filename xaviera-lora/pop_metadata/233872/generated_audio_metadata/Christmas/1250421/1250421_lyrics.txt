Dancing'round the lights
Sparkling with gleam
Snowflakes falling softly
By the Christmas tree
Warm smiles all around, hearts so full and free
Laughter fills the room by the Christmas tree
Oh, let's dance, dance, dance by the twinkling tree
The joy, joy, joy together you and me
Oh, let's twirl and sway all night through the gleam
In this magic moment by the Christmas tree
Gifts wrapped in love
Underneath the pine
Humming all our favorite tunes
Feeling so divine
Lights are shining bright
Candles in the night
Holding hands so tight, everything's alright
Voices blended in cheer, silent night so near
In each other's arms, nothing more to fear
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh yeah
Oh, let's dance, dance, dance
By the Franklin tree
Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy together you and me
Oh, let's swallow this weight all night through the gleam
In this magic moment
By the Christmas tree
Gifts wrapped in love
Underneath the pine
Haunting all our favorite gyms
Feeling so divine
Lights are shining bright
Candles in the night
Holding hands so tight
Everything's alright
Voices blend in cheer
Silent night so near
In each other's arms
Nothing more to fear
