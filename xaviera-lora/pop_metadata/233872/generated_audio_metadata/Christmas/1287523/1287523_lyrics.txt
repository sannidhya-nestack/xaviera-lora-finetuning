Snowflakes dance like notes in air
Making wishes everywhere
Icicles hug windowsills
Magic moments winter chills
Candy canes and mistletoe
Lights that set the world aglow
Carol songs of joy and cheer
All I want is you my dear
Dreaming of you for Christmas night
Under stars so big and bright
Wrapped in love so pure and true
Only wishes me and you
Hot cocoa and cozy socks
Silent night as time tick tocks
Presents waiting'neath the tree
None compared to you with me
Every snowman smiles your way
Hoping you'll decide to stay
Frosty air and heartfelt love
You're my better half
Dreaming of you for Christmas night
Under stars so big and bright
Wrapped in love so pure and true
Only wishes me and you
Hot cocoa and cozy socks
Silent night as time tick-tocks
Presents waiting'neath the tree
Uncompared to you with me
Every snowman smiles your way
Hoping you'll decide to stay
Frosty air and heartfelt love
You're my better half
Dreaming of you for Christmas night
On this star so big and bright
Wrapped in love so pure and true
Only wishes me and you
Or go, I'm cozy socks
Silent night as time tick tocks
Presents waiting'neath the tree
None compared to you with me
Every snowman smiles your way
Hoping you'll decide to stay
To stay
Frosty air and heartfelt laugh
You're my better half
Dreaming of you for Christmas night
On the stars so big and bright
Wrapped in love so pure and true
Only wishes me and you
