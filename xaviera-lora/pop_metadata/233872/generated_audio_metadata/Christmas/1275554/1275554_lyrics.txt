Icicles on winter's breath
Holly wreaths and festive dress
Dress
Gingerbread and spice delight
Ornaments that catch the light
The light
In the glow of candles flame
Every moment calls your name
December's melody in the air
Christmas magic everywhere
In this season hearts entwine
Love and joy through every line
Frosty windows peeking through
Sleigh bells ringing crisp and true
And true
Midnight skies of overhue
Santa's coming into view
In the glow of candles flame
Every moment calls your name
December's melody in the air
Christmas magic everywhere
In this season hearts entwine
Love and joy through every line
Snowy trails and pine trees tall
Echoes of a distant call, true
Northern lights and colors grand
Guiding us across the land, the land
December's melody in the air
Christmas magic everywhere
In this season hearts entwine
Love and joy through every line
