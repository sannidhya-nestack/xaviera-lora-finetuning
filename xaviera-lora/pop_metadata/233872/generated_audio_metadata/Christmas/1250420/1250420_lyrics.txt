Snowflakes dance on the windowpane
Hush in the night
City lights in a world, oh
So kaleidoscope bright
Stockings hang by the weary fire
Whispers from the wooden wall
I want this Christmas, darling if you could
Pine needles scent the air
Secret's pine and weight
Stars above in their endless song map our fate
Candles in the window
Flicker soft and blue
All I want this Christmas, darling, is you
No Santa, no reindeer, no jolly old crew
Just the warmth of your arms in the winter's hue
No presents, no ribbons, no shiny bright view
All I want this Christmas is you
Footsteps crunch on the frosty street
Echoes in my heart
Loneliness drapes the town
A ghostly arch in these smoke spirals
As dreams start anew
All I want this Christmas is you
Footsteps crunch on the frosty street
Echoes in the heart
Loneliness drapes the town
A ghostly art
Chimney smoke spirals as dreams start anew
All I want this Christmas, darling, is you
Holly on the mantel, whispers tales untold
Memories in the silence, so they unfold
Mistletoe sways as the night bids adieu
All I want this Christmas, darling, is you
No Santa, no reindeer, no jolly old crew
Just the warmth of your arms in the winter's hue
No presents, no ribbons, no shiny bright view
All I want this Christmas is you
