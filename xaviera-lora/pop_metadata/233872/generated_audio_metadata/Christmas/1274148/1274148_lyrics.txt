Stars are shining up above
Filled with warmth and endless love
Families gather, sharing cheer
Christmas time is finally here
Hear the laughter, feel the light
In this perfect starry night
On this starry Christmas night
Everything feels just right
Hearts together, pure delight
Underneath the sky so bright
Fireplaces burning warm
In each heart the love is born
Children dreaming, eyes that glow
Underneath the sky so bright
Your place is burning warm
In each heart the love is born
Children dreaming
Eyes that glow
Wondering what Santa will show
Hear the laughter
Feel the light
In this perfect starry night
On this starry Christmas night
Everything feels just right
Hearts together, pure delight
Underneath the sky so bright
With each star a wish we make
Treasured memories we'll take
Hand in hand we'll celebrate
In the season loves our fate
On this starry Christmas night
Everything feels just right
Hearts together pure delight
Underneath the sky so bright
With each star a wish we make
Treasured memories we'll take
Hand in hand we'll celebrate
In the season loves our fate
