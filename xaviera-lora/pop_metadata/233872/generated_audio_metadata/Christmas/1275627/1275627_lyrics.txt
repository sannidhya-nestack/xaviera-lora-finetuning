No face dance in the gentle breeze, mm-mm
Warmth in my heart, oh can't you see, mm-mm
Lights are shining all around
What a lovely time we found
Christmas night with those I love
My heart is full, like stars above
Laughter, joy, this moment's ours
This Christmas, we'll shine like stars
Songs are ringing, laughter grind
Ooh, ooh, ooh, little hands holding cocoa tight
Ooh, ooh, ooh, together we share joy in the air
These precious moments nothing can compare
Christmas night with those I love (those I love)
My heart is full like stars above (like stars above)
About to join (about to join)
This moment's ours, this Christmas will shine like stars
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, shine like stars
Christmas night
With those I love, who's I love
My heart is full of hope
Like stars above
Wrapped in joy, in joy
This moment's ours
This Christmas will shine like shine
Like stars, stars, stars
Like stars, stars, stars
We'll shine like stars
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Christmas night with those I love
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My heart is full
Like stars we'll come, wrapped in joy
This moment's ours, this Christmas will shine
Like stars, oh, oh, oh, this Christmas night
Like stars, oh, oh, oh, this Christmas will shine
Like stars, like stars
Woo! Pussy walkin' rules, mouth it!
