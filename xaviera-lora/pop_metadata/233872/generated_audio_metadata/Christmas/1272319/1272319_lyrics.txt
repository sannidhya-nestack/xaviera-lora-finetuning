While the carolers are making their house calls
Underneath the sea of stars
While the stores are filled with shoppers
And the highways jammed with cars
We'll be far from the hustle and bustle
When the reindeer are making their flight
It's a cozy kind of feeling
As we wait for Santa tonight
We'll be mistletoeing while the embers are glowing
As we watch it snowing Christmas Eve
Ooh mistletoeing while the winter winds blowing
We'll be mistletoeing you and me
Misutawin, while the embers are glowing
As we watch it snow in Christmas Eve, oh
Misutawin, while the winter wind's blowing
We'll be misutawin, you and me
Mistletoeing, you and me, you and me, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
