Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
There's a storm blowin' over the ocean
And I've heard it's comin' our way
But I don't care where it's headed
Here's where I'm gonna stay
Let's put one more log on the fire
I don't want you catching a cold
If the phone rings we won't enter
We've got all our worries on hold
We'll be made
Mistletoeing while the embers are glowing
As we watch it snowing, Christmas Eve, oh
Mistletoeing while the winter wind's blowing
We'll be mistletoeing, you and me
You and me
While the carolers are making their house calls
Underneath a sea of stars
While the stores are filled with shoppers
And the highways jammed with cars
We'll be far from the hustle and bustle
When reindeer are making their flight
It's a cozy kind of feeling
As we wait for Santa tonight
We'll be made
Mistletoe-ing while the embers are glowing
As we watch it snowing, Christmas Eve, oh
Mistletoe-ing while the winter wind's blowing
We'll be mistletoe-ing, you and me
We'll be mistletoe-ing
While the embers are glowing
As we watch it snowing
Christmas Eve, oh baby
We'll be mistletoeing while the winter wind's blowing
We'll be mistletoeing you and me, ooh yeah
You and me, you and me
Where is that mistletoe?
