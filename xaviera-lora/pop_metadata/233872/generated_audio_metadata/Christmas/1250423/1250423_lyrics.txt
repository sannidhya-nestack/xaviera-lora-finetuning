On a snowy night, the city glows
Lamp posts sparkle, streets lined with bows
We gather close, all hearts averse
Two winters chill in holiday mirth
With soft-lit trees, the rooms all bloom
In red and gold, dispelling gloom
The family's here, old faces new
In laughter's dance, a joyful view
Oh, it's Christmas Eve, and rooms are bloom
In red and gold, dispelling gloom
The family's here, old faces new
In laughter's dance, a joyful view
Oh, it's Christmas Eve under starry skies
The family's here with twinkling eyes
From near and far they all arrive
Love's embrace it keeps dreams alive
Guitars strum slow, piano keys
Duet sings with melodies
Glasses cling, the toast to the cheer
We're all together once a year
Peaceful moments whisper slow
By the fire's light sweet embers glow
Stories shared with festive flair
In this cozy night love fills the air
Silent night so softly played
While we cherish how memories are made
With every hug and stolen glance
We revive the love
We get the chance, oh lose
Oh, it's Christmas Eve under starry skies
The family's here with twinkling eyes
From near and far they all arrive
Love's embrace, it keeps dreams alive
