Hark! The herald angels sing, "Glory to the newborn King !"
Peace on earth and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled
Joyful!
Joy in nations rise
Joy the triumph of the skies
With angelic hosts proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King
Christ, my highest heaven adore
Christ, the everlasting Lord
Late in time behold him come
Offspring of the virgin's womb
Felt in flesh, the Godhead sing
Held in corn a deity
Priestess met with men to dwell
Jesus, our Emmanuel
All the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Hail the half-born Prince of Peace
Hail the Son of Righteousness
Light and life to all He brings
Risen with healing in His wings
Multilayered
Born to raise the sons of earth. Born to give them second birth. Of the herald angels sing.
Glory to the new born King
