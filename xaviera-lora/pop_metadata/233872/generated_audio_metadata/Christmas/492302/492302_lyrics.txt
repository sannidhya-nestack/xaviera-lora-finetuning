God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
For Jesus Christ our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we have gone astray
For all tidings of God
Comfort and joy, comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace
This holy time of grace
Mess or love, let not be fazed
Oh, tidings of comfort
Comfort and joy, comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
