Jingle jangles down the lane
Santa's lap just like champagne
Snowflakes twirlin' dancin' glee
Holiday and you and me
Quaintlin' eyes behind his beer
Lights and laughter all appear
Sleigh bells ringing round the night
Giddy joy and pure delight
Oh ho ho let's go go go
Twist and twirl beneath the snow
Hear the rhythm feel the swing
Celebrate with everything
Gifts and stockings by the fire
Notes of joy and festive choir
Candy canes and gingerbread
Merry magic all widespread
Santa's caps it's oh so snug
Hats and mittens in a hug
Reindeer prancing stepping high
Chimneys puffing by and by
Oh ho ho let's go go go
Twist and twirl beneath the snow
Hear the rhythm feel the swing
Celebrate with everything
Oh, oh, ho, ho, let's go, go, go
Twist and twirl beneath the snow
Hear the rhythm, feel the swing
Celebrate with everything
