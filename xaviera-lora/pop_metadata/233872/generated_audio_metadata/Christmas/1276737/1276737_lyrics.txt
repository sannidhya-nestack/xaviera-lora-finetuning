Stars are twinkling in the sky
As we watch the snowflakes fly
Hand in hand we take a stroll
Feeling love within our soul
In the glow of festive lights
Magic fills these winter nights
Enchanted Christmas night
Hearts in twines
In this season of we find
Wrapped in warmth our spirits high
Underneath the midnight sky
Fireplace with embers bright
Cuddle close we hold on tight
Mistletoe above we kiss
Moments like this pure blue bliss
In the glow of festive lights
Magic fills these winter nights
Enchanted Christmas night
Hearts entwined
In this season love we find
Wrapped in warmth our spirits high
Underneath the midnight sky
Carriage rides through snowy streets
Every heartbeat softly beats
In your eyes I see the glow
Christmas love it gently flows
Enchanted Christmas night
Hearts entwined
In this season of we find
Wrapped in warmth our spirits hide
Underneath the midnight sky
Carriage rides through snowy streets
Every heartbeat softly beats
In your eyes I see the glow
Christmas love it gently flows
Enchanted Christmas night
Hearts entwined
In this season love we find
Wrapped in warmth our spirits high
Underneath the midnight sky
