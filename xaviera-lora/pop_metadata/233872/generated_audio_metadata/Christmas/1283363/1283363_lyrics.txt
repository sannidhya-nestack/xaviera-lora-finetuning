In a workshop in North Nowhere bright
Elves are working day and night
Wheels and gears they turn and spin
Where the magic does begin
Candy canes and toy machines
Shiny trinkets red and green
Every stitch and every seam
Part of every child's dream
We're elfin around making joy about
Santa's sleigh will soon touch down
In laughter's echo we are bound
Nothing stops us elfin around
We whistle while we rap the cheer
Jingle bells are what you hear
Sawdust, snowflakes, wood and deer
Holiday comes near and near
Mini hammers, tiny wrenches
Busy hands across the benches
From dawn to dusk, no time to lounge
Making toys without a frown
We're elfing around, making joy about
Santa's sleigh will soon touch down
In laughter's echo we are bound
Nothing stops us elfing around
