Walked on, walk on windows shoppin'
Smoke flakes droppin' like fireflies
Pickpockets schemin', little kids dreamin'
Caps careening through the ice
It's Christmas time in the (Big City)
Christmas time in the (Big City)
Christmas time in the big city
Look at all the pretty lights
Lonely singles, double espressos
Triple X shows on my keys
A little too much slush, a little too much rush
Trudging through the tundra, looking for a treat
It's Christmas time in the (big city)
Christmas time in the (big city)
Christmas time
Look at all the pretty lights, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Salvation Army bands are swingin'
Black white yellow saddles singin'
Columns and bells are ringin'
Cash registers are changin' changin'
It's Christmas time in the
Big city, Christmas time enough
Big city, Christmas time enough
Big city, look at all the pretty lights
Cops clip-clopping the beat on horseback
Subway shoppers help themselves
Rolex watch fakes go like hotcakes
Ho-ho-ho's dressed up like Elms
It's Christmas time in the big city
Christmas time in the big city
Christmas time in the big city
Look at all the pretty lights
Gender benders, sidewalk benders
Urchin merchants, hawking buyers
Gay appellers, homeless carolers
Singing for the supper, huddle round the fire
It's Christmas time in the big city
Christmas time in the big city
Christmas time in the big city
Look at all the pretty lights
Salvation Army bands are swinging
Black, white, yellow sailors singing
Columns and bells are ringing
Cash registers are jang, jang, janging
It's Christmas time in the big city
Christmas time in the big city
Christmas time in the
Big city
Look at all the pretty lights
Look at all the pretty lights
Look at all the pretty sights
