I wonder as I wander out under the sky
How Jesus the Savior did come to die
To save lowly people like you and like I
I wonder as I wander out under the sky
When Jesus was born it was in a cow stall
With shepherds and wise men and angels and all
The blessings of Christmas from heaven did fall
The weary world awoke to the Savior's call
When Mary birthed Jesus'twas in a cow stall
With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all
And high from God's heaven a star's light did fall
The promise of the ages it then did recall
If Jesus had wanted for anything
A star in the sky or a bird on the wing
Are all of God's angels in heaven to sing
He surely could have had it
he was the King
He surely couldn't have had it
he was the king
