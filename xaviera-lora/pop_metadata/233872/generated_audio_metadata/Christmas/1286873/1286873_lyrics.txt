Chimneys slide a magic sleigh
Whispers hope at break of day
Reindeer hoof prints lined with cheer
Santa's magic trolling ear
Elves are dancing in the snow
Twinkle lights put on a show
Milk and cookies by the tree
Mystery wrapped up in glee
Magic Santa spreads his wings
Gifts from him to all beings
Tinsel dreams in every mind
Joy and wonder intertwine
Stockings hanging in a row
Little hearts that truly glow
Winter nights so calm, so bright
Santa's magic lights the night
Ho, ho, ho, the laughter rolls
Filling warmth in every soul
Reindeer chorus makes us sing
Worlds united in a ring
Candy canes and peppermint, snowflakes twirling, feel the hint of some magic in the air, Santa's love is everywhere
Magic Santa spreads his wings
Gifts from him to all beings
Tinsel dreams in every mind
Joy and wonder intertwine
Stockings hanging in a row
Little hearts that truly glow
Winter nights so calm, so bright
Santa's magic lights the night
Ho, ho, ho, the laughter rolls
Filling warmth in every soul
Reindeer chorus makes us sing
Worlds united in a ring
Candy canes and peppermint
Snowflakes twirling, feel the hint
Of some magic in the air
Santa's love is everywhere
