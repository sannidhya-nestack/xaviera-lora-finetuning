Here we come, a caroling among the leaves so green
Here we come, a wandering so fair to be seen
Love and joy come to you, and to you glad Christmas too
And God bless you and send you a happy new year
And God send you a happy new year
We are not daily beggars that beg from door to door
But we are neighbor's children whom you have seen before
Love and joy come to you and to you glad Christmas too
And God bless you and send you a happy new year
And God send you a happy new year
Good Master and Mistress, as you sit by the fire
Pray think of us, poor children who wander in the mire
Love and joy come to you, and to you glad Christmas too
And God bless you and send you a Happy New Year
And God send you a Happy New Year
Love and joy come to you, and to you glad Christmas too
And God bless you and send you a Happy New Year
And God send you a Happy New Year
Love and joy come to you, and to you glad Christmas too
And God bless you and send you a Happy New Year
And God bless you and send you a Happy New Year
And God send you a Happy New Year
