Dissing off flicks falling on my face
City lights in a snow globe space
Boots thumping keeping pace
Withers chill leaves a trace
Electric beats in the frosty air
Warmth by grooves everywhere
Hoodies up cold to dare
Families meet with time to share
You tie rhythms in the night
Keep the season burning bright
Dance beneath the festive lights
Celebrate the morning light
Guilty rhythms in the night
Keep the season burning bright
Dance beneath the festive lights
Celebrate'til morning light
Frosty breath and tempo sink
Bison beats make fire link
Every step a numbing blink
Joy in every casual wink
Gift wraps torn into light
Stars explode the velvet night
Gather round trees glow light
Spread the happiest vibe right
Your tight rhythms in the night
Keep the season burning bright
Dance beneath the festive lights
Celebrate'til morning light
Your tight rhythms in the night
Keep the season burning bright
Dance beneath the festive lights
Celebrate'til morning light
