Little child, little child, little child, little child, little child
Ooh, baby, ooh
Lullay now little tiny child
Bye bye Lulu, lullay
Lullay now little tiny child
Bye bye Lulu, lullay
Oh sisters do how may we do
For to preserve this day
For whom we sing, "Bye-bye, Lulu-Lulay !"
Herod the king in his raging charge he had this day (who knew)
His men of might in his own sight all children young to slay (who knew)
And woe is me born child for thee and never more than say
For thy part him more say, more sing
Bye-bye, lulululay
Lulay, thou little tiny child
Bye-bye, lulululay
Oh sisters too, how may we do
For to preserve this day
This poor young man for whom we sing
Bye bye, loo loo, loo lay
Lulé, thou little tiny child
Bye-bye, lulú, lulé
Oh, sisters, to Habaey we do
For to preserve this day
This poor young man for whom we sing
Bye-bye, lulú, lulé
In a little tiny child (Lululay)
Bye-bye, lululay (Lululay)
Bye-bye, lululay (Lululay)
