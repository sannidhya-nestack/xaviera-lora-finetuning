Snowflakes fall, gently kiss the pavement
In the glove street lights I see your eyes
Wrapped in scarves and warm enchantment
Love's a gift that winter can't disguise
As we hold hands, strolling through December
Your smile makes the cold to surrender
Snowflakes fall, gently kiss the pavement
In the glow of street lights I see your eyes
Wrapped in scarves and warm enchantment
Love's a gift that winter can't disguise
As we hold hands, strolling through December
Your smile makes the call to surrender
Bringing love and Christmas cheer
With every whisper you draw me near
In this magic we find our way
Love at Christmas here to stay
Soft jazz plates dancing through our laughter
Underneath the mistletoe we sway
Memories we'll cherish ever after
Fireplace warmth we dream away
With every heartbeat, we feel it closer
In this moment, I'm your beholder
Bringing love and Christmas cheer
With every whisper, you draw me near
In this magic, we find our way
Love and Christmas here to stay
Hear the bells they chime so true
Carol sung for me and you
Together in this cozy blitz
Perfect nights of love like this
Ringing in love and Christmas cheer
With every whisper you draw me near
In this magic we find our way
Love and Christmas here to stay
