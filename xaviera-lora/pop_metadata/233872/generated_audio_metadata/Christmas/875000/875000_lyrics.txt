Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel, the first
The ages did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields where they may keep in their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep, Noel
Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel, Noel
Noel, Noel, Born is the King of Israel
They looked, looked up above
And saw a star shining in the east
Beyond them far and true
It gave, it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Born is the King of Israel
Born is the King of Israel
