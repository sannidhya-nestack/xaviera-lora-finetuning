Four calling birds, three French hens, two turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree
On the fifth day of Christmas my true love said to me
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
On the sixth day of Christmas, my true love came to me
Six geese a-laying, five golden rings
Four calling birds, three French hens
Two turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree

Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying

Nine ladies dancing, eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming, six kids a-playing
Five golden rings
Three French hens, two turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree
On the tenth day of Christmas my true love gave to me
Ten lords a-leapin', nine ladies dancing
Eight maids a-milkin', seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-layin'
Five golden rings

Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear
Gee, on the eleventh day of Christmas
My true love came to me
Eleven pipes a-fiping
Ten lords a-leaping
Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming
Six gates a-laying
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me
Twelve drummers drumming
Eleven pipers piping
Ten lords a leaping
Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids a milking
Seven swans a swimming
Six kings a laying
Five golden rings
Four cunning birds, three French hens, two turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree
And a partridge in a pear tree
