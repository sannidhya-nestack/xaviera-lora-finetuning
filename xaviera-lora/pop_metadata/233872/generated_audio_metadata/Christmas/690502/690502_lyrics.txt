Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plain
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strain
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Shepherds, why this Jubilee, yeah
Why your joyous strains prolong
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Him whose birth the angels sing
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria
In excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo.
Yeah, yeah, Gloria, Gloria, Gloria, Gloria, Gloria
Gloria
Gloria
