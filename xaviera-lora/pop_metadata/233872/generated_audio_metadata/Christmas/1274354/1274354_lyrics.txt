Snowflakes fall, a silent grace
Softly touch each upturned face
Twilight glows and winter's calm
Holding loved ones arm in arm
Fireside tales, warmth and light
Christmas fills this peaceful night
Frosted memories, crystal clear
In this season, all this dear
Hearts united, love's embrace
Christmas magic in this place
Icicle on window panes
That goes off a million names
Songs of cheer and bells that shine
Are the wonder of this time
Far side tales, warmth and light
Christmas fills this peaceful night
Frosted memories, crystal clear
In this season, all is dear
Hearts united, love's embrace
Christmas magic in this place
Underneath the starry night
Dreams take wing in silver light
Hand in hand we find our way
Through the wonder of this day
Frosted memories crystal clear
In this season all is dear
Hearts united loves embrace
Christmas magic in display
Underneath the starry night
Dreams take wing in silver light
Hand in hand we find our way
Through the wonder of this day
Christmas magic in this place
