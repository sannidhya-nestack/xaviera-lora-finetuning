Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mm-hmm, oh yeah
The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes
I love you Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my side until morning is night
Stay, stay, yeah, yeah, oh
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask you to stay
Close by me forever and love me I pray
Bless all the children in your tender care
And take us to heaven
To live with you there, oh yeah
Live with you there, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, yeah, yeah
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask you to stay
Close by me forever and love me I pray
For lots of children in your tender care
And take us to heaven
To live with you there
There and take us to heaven
To live with you there
I wanna live with you there
Oh yeah
Away in a manger
