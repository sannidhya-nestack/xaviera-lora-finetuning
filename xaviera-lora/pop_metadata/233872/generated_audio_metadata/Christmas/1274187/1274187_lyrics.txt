Candles flicker soft and bright
In the calm of Christmas night
Snowflakes fall on evergreen
Shimmering in the moon serene
Choirs hum a tender tune
Underneath the yuletide moon
Christmas stars shine a guiding light
Through the silent wondrous night
In your glow our hearts align
Bound together love divine
Diffs are wrapped with love and care
Echoes of joy fill the air
Cookies baking scent so sweet
Warmth and laughter we repeat
Choirs hum a tender tune
Underneath the yuletide moon
Christmas stars shine guiding light
Through the silent wondrous night
In your glow our hearts align
Bound together love divine
Gifts are wrapped with love and care
Echoes of joy fill the air
Cookies baking, scent so sweet
Warmth and laughter we repeat
Choirs hum a tender tune
Underneath the yuletide moon
Christmas stars shine guiding light
Through the silent wondrous night
In your glow our hearts align
Bound together love divine
Stockings hung with dreams so dear
Filled with hope for the new year
By the fire stories told
Magic moments to behold
Bound together love divine
Gifts are wrapped with love and care
Echoes of joy fill the air
Cookies baking scent so sweet
Want the laughter we repeat
Choirs hum a tender tune
Underneath the yuletide moon
Christmas stars shine guiding light
Through the silent wondrous night
In your glow our hearts alight
Bound together love divine
Under mistletoe we stand, promises in every hand
Carols ring through frosted trees, harmony in winter's breeze
