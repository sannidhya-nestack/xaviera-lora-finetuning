In a workshop north of nowhere bright
Elves are working day and night
Wheels and gears they turn and spin
Where the magic does begin
Candy canes and toy machines
Shiny trinkets red and green
Every stitch and every seam
Part of every child's dream
We're elfin around
Making joy abound
Santa's sleigh will soon touch down
Elastors echo, we are bound
Nothing stops us elfin' around
Whistle while we wrap the cheer
Jingle bells are what you hear
Sawdust snowflakes wooden deer
Holiday comes near and near
Mini hammers, tiny wrenches
Busy hands across the benches
From dawn to dusk, no time to lounge
Making toys without a frown
Candy canes and toy machines
Shiny trinkets red and green
Every stitch and every seam
Part of every child's dream
We're elfin' around, making joy abound
Santa's sleigh will soon touch down
Hear laughter's echo, we are bound
Nothing stops us elfin' around
