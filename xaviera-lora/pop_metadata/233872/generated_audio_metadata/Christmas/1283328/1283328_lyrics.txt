Oh, snow is gently falling, as the tinsel starts to gleam
The world is soft and calling to a wintertime dream
With a dance around the fire and a twinkle in each eye
Our spirits climbing higher'neath the glittering sky
Swimming through the season with lights that never fade
Every joyful reason in melodies we've made
Jingle bells are ringing with a jazzy little twist
You'll see the stars they're singing will get lost in this
Grateful tunes echo brightly in the frosty evening air
Hold your lover tightly
Feel the magic everywhere
Sit hot cocoa warm and sweet
By the fires glow will stay
Every heartbeat every beat
Will laugh and softly sway
