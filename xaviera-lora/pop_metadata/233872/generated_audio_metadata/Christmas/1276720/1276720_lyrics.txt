Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Snow-capped roofs and icy streams
Christmas Eve, the night of dreams
Candlelight through frosted glass
Moments we wanna last
In the glow of stars so bright
We find peace on this night
Christmas Eve reverie pure and sweet
Filling hearts with love's heartbeat
In the stillness dreams take flight
Magic in the silent night
Stockings hung with tender care
Joy and hope fill the air
Voices lifted in a hymn
Christmas spirit deep within
In the glow of stars so bright
We find peace on this night
Christmas Eve reverie pure and sweet
Filling hearts with love's heartbeat
In the stillness
Dreams take flight
Magic in the silent night
Snowman built with scarves and hats
Footprints where the reindeer sat
Underneath the starry sky
Wishes whispered, dreams that fly
Christmas Eve, reverie pure and sweet
Filling hearts with thoughts might be in the stillness
Dreams take flight
Magic in the silent night
