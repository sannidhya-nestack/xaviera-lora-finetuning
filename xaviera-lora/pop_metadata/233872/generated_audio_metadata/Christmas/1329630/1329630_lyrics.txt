Snowflakes falling on quiet streets
While heaven's plan comes into reach
In Bethlehem a child cries
The promised gift, the Lord most high
No crown of gold, no palace bed
Just hay and cloth beneath His head
Yet angels sang with blazing light
The Savior born this holy night
Heaven came down tonight
Beneath the stars so bright
The world stood still in holy cheer
As love himself drew near
Angels filled the skies
With glory songs and joyful cries
The miracle of Christmas shines
Cause heaven came down tonight
Shepherds trembling in the field
Heard news too wondrous to conceal
Glory to God, the chorus rang
As Heaven's King in silence came
The wise men travelled from afar
Drawn by faith and guided stars
Their gifts could never quite compare
To mercy lying helpless there
Heaven came down tonight
Beneath the stars so bright
The world stood still in holy cheer
As love himself drew near
Angels filled the skies
With glorious songs and joyful cries
The miracle of Christmas shines
heaven came down tonight
Now every heart becomes the end
Where Christ is welcomed in again
Let every carol rise and soar
For joy has opened heaven's door
Heaven came down tonight
To set the wrong things right
The prince of peace, the newborn king
Has made the silent stable sing
So lift your voice on high
Let every soul and street replay
The hope we've waited for arrived
When heaven came down tonight
