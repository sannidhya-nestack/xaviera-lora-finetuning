Elves busy in the workshop
Gadgets buzzing non-stop
Lights flashing in the air
Santa's sleigh beyond compare
We got the lights bright
And tinsel shimmer tight
Prepping for the big night
Santa's right in sight
Hammers clink and tools twirl
Candy canes in a whirl
Wrapping gifts with elf embrace
Joy and cheer in every place
We got the lights bright
And tinsel shimmer tight
Prepping for the big night
Santa's right in sight
Hear's turning circuits hum
Excitement pounding like a drum
Sleigh of magic takes its form
Ready for the snowy storm
We got the lights bright
And tinsel shimmer tight
Prepping for the big night
Santa's right in sight
We got the lights bright
And tinsel shimmer tight
Prepping for the big night
Sinners right in sight
