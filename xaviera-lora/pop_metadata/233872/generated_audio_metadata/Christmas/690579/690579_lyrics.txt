Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
What child is this who laid to rest on Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet while shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him, Lord, the Babe, the Son of Mary
