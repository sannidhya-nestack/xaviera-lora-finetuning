The snowflakes dance like stars above
In the air a scent of love
With gypsy tunes we play our parts
Christmas on the card
The fire's warm, the night is cold
Stories of the seasons told
Gypsy strums and finger smarts
Christmas on the card
Oh merry melodies we weave
Under twinkling lights we dream
With every note a joyful spark
It's Christmas on the card
Laughter shared and whispers sweet with dancing feet and joyful beat
Gather round the strings and heart it's Christmas on the card
Beyond the tinsel and the cheer what brings us close is crystal clear
Gypsy rhythm never far it's Christmas on the card
Oh merry melodies we weave
Under twinkling lights we dream
With every note a joyful spark
It's Christmas on the card
Oh merry melodies we weave
Under twinkling lights we dream
With every note a joyful spark
It's Christmas on the card
