Give me the best of us (Christmas, Christmas, ooh ooh ooh)
Give me the best of us (Christmas, Christmas, ooh ooh ooh)
We will dance to the rhythm of Christmas lights
Like kids in love on a sugar cookie high
Oh, this Christmas, he wants my kisses
I wanna stay at the top of his wish list
Santa, take our fun into the new year
Santa, take our love into the new year
This Christmas, carry the best of us through
The new year
We'll stay up, waiting for Santa's flight
Like kids in love, on the stars and satellites
Oh, this Christmas, I want his kisses (kisses)
He wants to stay at the top of my wish list
Santa, take a pawn into the new year
Santa, take a love into the new year
This Christmas, carry the best of us through the new year
They carry the best of us, ooh ooh ooh
Through the fears, the tears, the smiles
The laughter and the trials
All the giants who seem so small (under the stars)
Under the stars (under the stars)
Under the stars
Christmas, carry the best of us
Christmas, carry the best of us
Christmas, carry the best of us
Christmas, carry the best of us
