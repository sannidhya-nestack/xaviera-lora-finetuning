Christmas lights on those stormy nights
Help to keep my spirit bright
And I like to call when snow starts to fall
Just to make sure you're alright
And I count the days in my weary haze
Until we meet again
But the Christmas lights keep me going until then
Christmas time always has a shine
Brings a warmth into my heart
And the great surprise in the children's eyes
Guess that's still my favorite part
And it's understood peace and brotherhood
Are the joys the season brings
With each jingling bell an angel gets their wings
Ebenezer gets to save his soul
G e Bailey's friends come through
And I can't wait to share it all with you
The fire is burning low
So to bed I'll go
I know I've got to get some rest
So I'll blow a kiss
To you, the one I miss
And pray the angels keep you blessed
And I'll hold you tight through the stormy night
That sweet dream will pull me through
And someday soon I'll watch those Christmas lights with you
Someday soon I'll watch those Christmas lights with you
