It's winter break and my friends are all back home
Sharing stories, warming hands with hot cocoa
I killed the radio in the middle of let it snow
The DJ played it less than hour ago
Don't wanna, don't want another basic Christmas
Why don't we make some new traditions?
Let's dig the holes in this vase
Fa la la la
Till we can't feel our face
Don't wanna, don't wanna, don't want another basic Christmas
Recycled Christmas tunes
This winter deja vu has got me blue
Let's make these ugly sweaters dance to something new
Don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna
Another basic Christmas
Why don't we make some new traditions?
Let's take the halls in this place
Fa la la la
Till we can't feel a thing
Don't wanna, don't wanna, don't want another basic Christmas
We don't need no mistletoe
Let's go streaking in the snow
Jump in the hot tub when we're cold
Being silly together with you brings me home
Don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't want another basic Christmas
Why don't we make some new traditions?
Let's take the halls in this place
Fa la la la
Till we can't feel our face
Don't wanna, don't wanna another basic Christmas
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
