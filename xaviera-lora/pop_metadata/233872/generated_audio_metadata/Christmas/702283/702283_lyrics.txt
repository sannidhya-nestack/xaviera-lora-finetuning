I'm so glad that you are near and Christmas time is almost here
Joy and laughter fill the air
This year one thing I'd like to do is spend Christmas time with you
We can hear the sleigh bells ring
The melodies of caroling
Lights twinkle in the night
Turns out my favorite thing to do
Is spend Christmas time with you
Santa's on his way
He's filling up his sleigh
Bringing joy to all on this day
This beautiful winter's home
So take my hand (where will we go?)
I'll take you out into the snow
There's nowhere I'd rather be
It's true, one thing I love to do
Is spend Christmas time with you
Let's hang the mistletoe
Warm up by fire glow
And celebrate the wonderland of snow
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
