I'm walking outside
It's snowing, everywhere's white
People smiling and in my heart
Happy moments, fill me up
I wish love stays in your life
Warms up your heart for Christmas
This is the happiest time
It's a magical night
It's Christmas
Snowflakes flying all around
It's cold but it's alright
The bells are ringing and children smile
Merry Christmas everyone
I wish love stays in your life
Warms up your heart for Christmas
This is the happiest time
It's a magical night
It's Christmas
I wish love stays in your life
Warms up your heart for Christmas
This is the happiest time
It's a magical night, it's Christmas
I wish love stays in your life
Warms up your heart for Christmas
This is the happiest time
It's a magical night
It's Christmas
