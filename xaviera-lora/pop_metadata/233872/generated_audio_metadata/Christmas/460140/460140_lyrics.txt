Everybody's talking'bout Christmas time
Christmas time is here
Everybody's talking'bout Christmas time
Christmas time is here
Sleigh bells are a-ringing
Choirs are a-singing
All our friends are bringing their gifts for you
Watch the falling snow
Hang that mistletoe
Drink that cup of joe and be merry too
Everybody's talking'bout Christmas time, Christmas time is here
Everybody's talking'bout Christmas time, Christmas time is here
Everybody's talking'bout Christmas time
Christmas time is here
Everybody's talking'bout Christmas time
Christmas time is here
Can't you feel the thrill and the winter chill?
There is such goodwill everywhere you look
Sitting by the fire, the snow is piled high
Your stockings hung with wire, it's a picture book
Everybody's talking'bout Christmas time
Christmas time is here
Everybody's talking'bout Christmas time
Christmas time is here
Everybody's talkin'bout Christmas time
Christmas time is here
Everybody's talkin'bout Christmas time
Christmas time is here
Everybody's happy'bout Christmas time
Christmas time is here
Everybody's happy'bout Christmas time
Christmas time is here
