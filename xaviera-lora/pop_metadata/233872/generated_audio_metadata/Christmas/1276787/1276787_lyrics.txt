Santa's got his groove on tonight
Reindeer's dancing in pure delight
Elves are swinging by the tree
It's a jingle and jive jubilee
Snow is falling, rhythm's tight
Candy canes and twinkling light
Snipings hung by the fire's glow
Feel the beat let's start the show
Jingle and jive over the sites
Christmas here at Evergreen, we bite
Tap your toes and swing along
Set a break with dancing songs
Cheer your bed man on the floor
Swaying to the bells we all adore
Presents piling high with care
Wrapped in joy and love to share
Deck the halls and move your feet
Magic pulses in the beat
Drum and bass with sleigh bells ring
Dreams are made of this swaying
Jingle and jive oh what a sight
Christmas here in Evergreen we bite
Tap your toes and swing along
Celebrate with dance and song
Jingle and jive, oh what a sight
Christmas cheer in every breath bite
Tap your toes and swing along
Celebrate with dance and song
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do do, do-do-do-do-do, do, do-do-do-do, do, do
