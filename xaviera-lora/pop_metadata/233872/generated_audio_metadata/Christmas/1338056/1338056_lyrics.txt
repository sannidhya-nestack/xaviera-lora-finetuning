Snow in my mind but the city's all rain
December lights flicker but it's not the same
Dreaming in my window I trace your name
Wishing for magic for a scene that never came
Warm in my arms, but the night's still long
Hoping for whispers of a distant song
Closing my eyes, let the world be still
I see silver skies on that winter hill
Maybe I'm wishing on a distant star
For a miracle scene wherever you are
Soft in my heart is a shimmering hope
Snow falling love wrapped up in a coat
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Underneath these city lights
Candle glow and silent wishes
Holding on to you tonight
Let the rooftops turn to diamonds
Let the world be hushed and bright
Baby even if the snow don't fall
You're my white Christmas tonight
Crossing the miles with my whispers and prayers
Holiday movies but nobody compares
Under my tree is a longing so true
Every dream blanket I'm waiting for you
Carols are playing but all I hear
Is the sound of your footsteps drawing near
Windows keep frosting, the night grows deep
If snow never comes, it's your love I'll keep
Maybe I'm wishing on a distant star
For a miracle scene wherever you are
Soft in my heart is a shimmering hope
Snow falling love wrapped up in a cover
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas underneath these city lights
Candle glow and silent wishes holding on to you tonight
Let the rooftops turn to diamonds, let the world be hushed and bright
Baby, even if the snow don't fall, you're my white Christmas tonight
Every flake in my dreams is a promise you'll find me
Blanket the world in your arms, let the night remind me
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, even when no snow's inside
All I want, all I'm needing is you with me tonight
That's the only white Christmas I need, right?
