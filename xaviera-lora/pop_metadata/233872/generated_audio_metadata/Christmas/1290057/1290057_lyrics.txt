The city glows, the heart goes slow
Holiday tunes, the playlist flows
Santa spins on vinyl boards
Chill beats mix with sleigh bell chords
Eggnog, Spice, we toast the cheer
Tokyo streets or Venice pier
Mixin' tracks from past and new
Groovin' soft and sky so blue
Santa's DJ tonight, spinnin' bright
Waves of calm and winter's light
Headphones on, he's in the zone
Keeping Christmas Jill alone
Coco simmering by the fire
Warming hearts and lights inspire
Vinyl crackles in the air
Santa's mix is rare and rare
Under mistletoe we sway
To the tunes of Christmas day
Silent night turned mellow vibe
Santa's mix we all imbibe
Santa's DJ tonight spinning bright
Waves of calm in winter's light
Headphones on, he's in the zone
Keeping Christmas chill alone
Santa's DJ tonight, spinning bright
Waves of Kong and winter's light
Headphones on, he's in the zone
Keeping Christmas chill along
