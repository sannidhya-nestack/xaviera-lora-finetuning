Underneath the wind, the sky so clear
Snowflakes falling, it's that time of year
I see the light, it's just shining bright
But something's missing, it doesn't feel quite right
Then you walk in with that smile I know
Suddenly the world starts to glow
You take my hand, we're standing near
But what is the mistletoe whispering in your ear?
What is the mistletoe whispering in your ear?
Is it telling you that love is miniature?
Leaning across sudden, sudden tears
It's saying all the things I long to hear
What is the mistletoe whispering in your ear now?
It's making life feels like a sign
But I'm still waiting for your heart to align
With the rhythm of this passive night
Hoping you'll tell me if it feels right
You look at me, rise sincere
What is the mistletoe whispering in your ear?
What is the mistletoe whispering in your ear
Is it telling you that love is in
Should I lean in close, sound it, sound it
What is the mistletoe whispering in your ear
Is it saying all the things I long to hear
What is the mistletoe whispering in your ear
What is the mistletoe whispering in your ear?
Is it telling you that love is mean?
Should I lean in close? I do
I just wanna be there right next to you
What is the mistletoe whispering in your ear?
Is it saying all the things I don't see here?
What is the moment that's dying?
So tell me now and don't make me wait
I'll tell this mistletoe, let's have faith
What is the mistletoe whispering in your ear
How much the words have been waiting to hear
