Snow is falling down and the lights are shining bright
Join me by the fire, we'll share this festive night
My heart is warm and kind, I've got a gift for you to find
With every smile we share, the season will be so fair
Christmas cheer, Christmas cheer
Spread the love far and near
Christmas cheer, Christmas cheer
It's the best time of the year
Sing carols with me
Let's make memories to keep
In this magic season
We'll laugh and never weep
Our hearts are filled with joy
Like we're kids with a new toy
Hold you close, hold you tight
On this wondrous winter's night
Christmas cheer, Christmas cheer
Spread the love far and near
Christmas cheer, Christmas cheer
It's the best time of the year
Under the mistletoe
Love's magic starts to grow
In every silent night
Let our hearts take flight
Christmas cheer, Christmas cheer
Spread the love far and near
Christmas cheer, Christmas cheer
It's the best time of the year
