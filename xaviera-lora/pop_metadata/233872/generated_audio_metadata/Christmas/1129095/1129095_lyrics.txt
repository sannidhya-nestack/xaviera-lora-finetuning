It sometimes seems that all your dreams have been bloomed and never will
And the summer sun has gone too soon, giving way to autumn chill
But there's no heart that can't be warmed
By the smile of young girls and boys
And the season is a reason for their joy
Hold on to Christmas
See through the eyes of a child
Cherish each moment and every embrace
Let your dreams run wild
Hold tight to that feeling
Be joyful in all that you do
Set your heart free
And soon you will see
That Christmas lives in you
At Christmas time we all try to find some magic if we can
And reflect upon the child of God who ave the sins of man
To feel the warmth of Vulcan friend
And be thankful for his birth
A time to stop and pray for peace on earth
Hold on to Christmas
Find joy in just being alive
Smile for the sake of spreading some love
Let your good true spirit thrive
Don't be afraid to wonder
If one day your dreams can come true
Set yourself free and soon you will see
Christmas lives in you
