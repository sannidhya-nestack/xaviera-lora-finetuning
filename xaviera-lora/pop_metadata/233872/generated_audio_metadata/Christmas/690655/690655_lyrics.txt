Go tell it, tell it, tell it, go, ooh
Go tell it, tell it, tell it, Go, ooh
That Jesus Christ is born
While shepherds kept their watching
Over silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus
The shepherds feared and trembled
When low above the earth
Rang out the angels' chorus
Of hail the Saviour's
The Angel of Heaven, go tell it, tell it, tell it, go
Tell it on the mountains, over the hills and everywhere
Go, go, tell it on the mountains
That Jesus Christ is born
Down in a lonely manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent our salvation
That blessed Christmas morning
Go, go, go, go
Tell it on the mountains everywhere
Go, just do it, go
Go, just do it, go
Go, just do it, go
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, just do it, go
Go tell it, tell it on the mountains
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
Ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-ba, yeah, yeah
Go, go, tell it, tell it, tell it on the mall
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the boat
That Jesus Christ is born
Sing it one more time
That Jesus Christ is born
He was born
And he's still alive, Merry Christmas
