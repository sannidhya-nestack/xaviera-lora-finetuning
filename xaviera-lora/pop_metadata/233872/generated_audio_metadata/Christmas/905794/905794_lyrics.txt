Maybe I've lost my mind
Trying to get back to you
We're out of time
Running on thin ice
Trying to get back to you
Just once a year
Here
Let's make this Christmas
Like the very first Christmas
Let's make this season
The one we were dreaming
So come with me
Let's sneak away
And this year
Let's make this Christmas just us
Just us
I'll bring the mistletoe
You bring the sweet champagne
Let's take it nice and slow
For the day
Just once a year
I need you here
Let's make this Christmas
Like the very first Christmas
Let's make this season
The one we were dreaming
So come with me
Let's sneak away
And this year
Let's make this Christmas just us
Just us
Let's make this Christmas
Like the very first Christmas
Let's make this season
The one we were dreaming
So come with me
Let's sneak away
And this year let's make this Christmas just us
This year let's make this Christmas just us
