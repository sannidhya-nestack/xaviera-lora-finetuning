They say a year goes by in the blink of an eye
Before you know it's here, the highlight of the year
This is the time to think of others
Happy holidays
It's something that we say
To make those words real
You have to share, you have to feel
So think of your sisters
And your brothers
Light a candle for the world
A candle for the world
Light it now, it's Christmas time
For a world where everyone can shine
The joy and the glory
When a child is born
The life and the story
Where hope is given and is shown
So think of your sisters
And your brothers
Light a candle for the world again
End of all the world
Light it now, it's Christmas time
For a world where everyone can shine
Light it for you and me
For liberty
Light it when days are dark
Create a spark
Light it for those who pray
And our lives still wait light
I can't ignore
Light a candle for the world
A candle for the world
Light it now, it's Christmas time
A world where everyone can shine
Light a candle for the world again
Light it now, it's Christmas time
For a world where everyone can shine
