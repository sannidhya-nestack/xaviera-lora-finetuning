Good King Wenceslaus looked out on the fuchs'dust even
When the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even
Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came inside, gathering winter fuel
Hear the page and stand by me, if thou know'st it telling
Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling?
Sir, he lives a goodly hence underneath the mountain
Right against the forest's fence by St. Agnes' fountain
Bring me flesh and bring me wine, bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I will see him dine when we bear them thither
Page and monarch forth they went, forth they went together
Through the rude winds, wild the man, and the bitter weather
Sir, the night is darker now, and the winds blow stronger
Fail my heart, I know not how, I can go no longer
Mark my footsteps, good my page, tread thou in them boldly
Thou shalt find the winter's rage, freeze thy bloodless coldly
In his master's steps he trod where the snow lay dented
Heat was in the very sod which the saint had printed
Therefore Christian and me sure wealth or rank possessing
He who now will bless the poor shall himself find blessing
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
The king is dead
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Oh, King Wenceslas, yeah
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Oh, the snow lay round the mound
Oh, the snow lay round the mound
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
