Lens and berries evergreen
Frost ignites a soaring scene
Tinsel glimmers silver bright
Mirroring the starry night
In this hush, a gentle cheer
Christmastime drawing near
Snowy seven days, sweet and clear
Filling hearts with festive cheer
In this winter's soft embrace
Love and joy in every place
Cocoa sips by candles glow
Footprints in the fresh late snow
Choirs sing with voices pure
Hymns of joy that will endure
In this hush
A gentle cheer, Christmas time drawing near
Snowy serenade, sweet and clear
Filling hearts with festive cheer
In this winter's soft embrace
Love and joy in every place
Cocoa sips by candles glow
Footprints in the fresh late snow
Choirs sing with voices pure
Hymns of joy that will endure
In this winter's soft embrace
Love and joy in every place
Snowflakes fall, a soft ballet
Dancing in the moonlight's ray
Hand in hand, we watch the show
Wrapped in warmth, the world aglow
Snowy serenade, sweet and clear
Filling hearts with festive cheer
In this winter, soft embrace
Love and joy in every place
