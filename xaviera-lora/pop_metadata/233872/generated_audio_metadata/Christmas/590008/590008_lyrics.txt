Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Shepherds, why this Jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be?
Which inspire your heavenly song?
Glory!
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
In excelsis Deo
Come to Bethlehem and see Christ, whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee Christ, the Lord, the newborn King
Glo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
See Him in a manger laid
Whom the choirs of angels praise
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid
While our hearts in love we raise
Glory
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
