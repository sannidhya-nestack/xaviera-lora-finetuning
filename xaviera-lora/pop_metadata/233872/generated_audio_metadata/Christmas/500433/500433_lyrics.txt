Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tails ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And wheelie got upset
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight and sing the slaying song
Just get up off down that 240 for his speed
Then hitch into an open sleigh and crack you'll take the lead
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
