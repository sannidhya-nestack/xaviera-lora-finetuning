Christmas lights, twinkling magic in the frosty night
Every moment with you feels so right
Snowflakes dancing in the silent sky
Christmas cheer, doesn't it feel like we're the only ones
Wrapped in love'til the morning comes
Christmas means celebrating with you
All these dreams coming true
Mistletoe sharing secrets in the fireside glow
Whispered wishes of the world we'll know
Hand in hand under stars we'll bow
Holding tight with every hug we melt the ice
You and me in this paradise
Christmas is celebrating with you
All these dreams coming true
In your arms, I find my peace
Every moment, tender release
With you beside, my heart's at ease
Love grows stronger, never ceases
Christmas means celebrating with you
All these dreams coming true
