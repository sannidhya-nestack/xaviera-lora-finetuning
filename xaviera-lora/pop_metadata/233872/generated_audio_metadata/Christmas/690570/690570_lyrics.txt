Pet a pet, pet a pet
Pet a pet
Pet a pet, pet a pet
Willy get your little drum
Robin bring your flute and come
Aren't they fun to play upon
To re-loo re-loo, pa-da pa-da pan
When you play your fife and drum
How can anyone
How can anyone be glum?
How can anyone be glum?
Padapad, yeah
When the men of olden days gave the king of kings their praise
They had pipes to play upon
To re-loo re-loo, pa-da pa-da pan
And also the drums they'd play full of joy on Christmas
Fall of joy on Christmas day
God and man today become
Closely joined as flute and drum
Let the joyous tune play on
To-re-lu-re-lu-pa-da-pa-da-pam
As the instruments you play
We will sing this Christmas day
Sing this Christmas day
We will sing this Christmas day
Pa-da-pa-pa-da-pa-da-pa-da-pa
Do-re-lu-re-lu-re-lu-re
Pa-da-pa
Pa-da
Pa-da-pa
Pa-da-pa
Pa-da-pa
