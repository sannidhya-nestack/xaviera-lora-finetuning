Snow falls gently, pure and white
Blanketing the world tonight
Candles glow with soft embrace
Lighting up each tender face
In the calm of winter's breath
We find peace, no fear of death
Silent night dreams
Calm and bright
Christmas magic in the night
In this stillness hearts will sing
Joy to all that Christmas brings
Hushed whispers by the fire
Tales of love and pure desire
Children's dreams take flight tonight
Guided by the starry light
In the calm of winter's breath
We find peace, no fear of death
Silent night dreams
Calm and bright
Christmas magic in the night
In this stillness hearts will sing
Joy to all that Christmas brings
Underneath the mist so tall
Stolen kisses soft and slow
Promises made true and dear
In this season love is clear
Silent night, dreams, calm and bright
Christmas magic in the night
In this stillness hearts will sing (will sing)
Joy to all that Christmas brings
Underneath the mistletoe
Stolen kisses soft and slow
Promises made true and dear
In this season love is clear
Silent night dreams
Calm and bright
