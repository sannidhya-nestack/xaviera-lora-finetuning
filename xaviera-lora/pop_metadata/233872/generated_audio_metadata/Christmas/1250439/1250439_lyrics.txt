In the evening, the moon's soft silver gleam
The snowflakes start to weave a dream
A hush upon the world so green
It's Christmas Eve and skies are clean
Shadows long and whispers low
Snowmen gather where the lanterns glow
Their button eyes begin to beam
Or how they sway in winter's theme
When the snowmen sing, it's Christmas Eve
Their frosty voices they never leave
A melody that angels weave
When the snowmen sing, it's Christmas Eve
With scarves so red and hats askew
They hum a carol soft and true
A song of yuletide cheer and light
That dances on through silent night
Each note, a flake that gently falls
A chorus echoes off the walls
They sing of love and joy so clear
That warms the coldest time of year
When the snowmen sing, it's Christmas Eve
Their frosty voices, they never leave
A melody that angels weave
When the snowmen sing, it's Christmas Eve
Christmas Eve
