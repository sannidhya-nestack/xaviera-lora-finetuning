Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, yeah, oh
The city shines, it's Christmas
You arrived, everything is special
We walk together through the streets
The whole night belongs to just us two
In the park, your gaze warms my heart
In this moment you're the only, only reason
Under the stars, we dance together
Our love in the air, Christmas shining bright
The lights flicker, I see your smile
Like a gift that time has given me, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
The snow falls softly outside
But inside the warmth is all yours, yes
In the morning, your gaze warms my heart
In this moment, you're the only, only reason
Under the stars, we dance together
Our love in the air, Christmas shining bright
Every moment is a real dream
With you Christmas has no equal
I hold you tight the world fades away
And only our love remains
In the cold your gaze warms my heart
In this moment you're the only, only reason
Oh, under the stars we dance together
Our love in the air, Christmas shining bright
Our love in the air, shining on this Christmas night
You'll be the best of us
