Gingerbread books and candy candy rings
No flakes but like sweet champagne
Icicles hang like chandelier of your dreams
While the elves backstage all sing
Wrapped up lights go soft and sleek
Santa works on holiday break
Gymneys buffing up foggy mist
While the reindeer run their checklist
Silent nights full of jazzy goo
Snowmen swayed specially tailored suits
Bells and beats all harmonized
Turn your twinkle lights to overdrive
Hot chocolate brews in the silent night
Dark cocoa that's extra bright
Jazz notes dance in the liner key
In our peppermint symphony
Stockings sway to the Christmas beat
Underneath the holly and dancing feet
Feast on tunes and sweet delight
This holiday jam feels just right
Violin nights full of jazzy groove
Snowmen sway in specially tailored suits
Vowels and beats all harmonize
Turn your twinkle lights to overdrive
Silent nights full of jazzy groove
Snowmen swaying specially tailored suits
Bells and beats all harmonize
Turn the twinkle lights to old drive
