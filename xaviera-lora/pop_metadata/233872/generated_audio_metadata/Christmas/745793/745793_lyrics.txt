I heard the bells on Christmas day
The old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men
I thought that how the day had come
The bell frees up old Christian dawn
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men
And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth, I said
For hate is strong
It mocks the song of peace on earth
Goodwill to men
I heard the bells on Christmas day
The old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Peace on earth, good will to men
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Peace on earth, goodwill to men
Peace on earth, goodwill to men
