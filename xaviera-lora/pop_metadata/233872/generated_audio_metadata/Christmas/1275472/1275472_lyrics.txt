Frosty windows warm inside
Children's eyes are open wide
Stockings hung with dreams so sweet
Waiting for a magic feat
Candles flicker, shadows play
Whispers of a wondrous day
Christmas Eve, lullaby soft and low
In this quiet love will grow
Hush now darling close your eyes
Underneath the starry skies
Cookies baked in the crepe
Little hearts no longer scared
Santa's coming through the night
Guided by the moon's soft light
Candles flicker
Shadow play, whispers of a wondrous day
Christmas Eve, lullaby soft and low
Cookies baked and milk prepared
Little hearts no longer scared
Santa's coming through the night
Guided by the moon's soft light
Candles flicker, shadow play
Whispers of a wondrous day
Christmas Eve, lullaby soft and low
Christmas Eve all up by soft and low
In this quiet love will grow
Hush now darling close your eyes
Underneath the starry sky
Cookies baked and milk prepared
Little hearts no longer scared
Santa's coming through the night
Guided by the moon's soft light
Candles flicker
Close your eyes underneath the starry skies
In the stillness dreams take flight
Magic moments pure and bright
Hold them close this time of year
Memories we hold so dear
Christmas Eve, lullaby salt and all
In the stillness, dreams take flight
Magic moment's pure and bright
Hold them close this time of year
Memories we hold so dear
Memories we hold so dear
In the stillness, dreams take flight
Magic moments, pure and bright
Hold them close this time of year
Memories we hold so dear
In the stillness, dreams take flight
Magic moments, pure and bright
Hold them close this time of year
Memories
Memories we hold so dear
So dear
