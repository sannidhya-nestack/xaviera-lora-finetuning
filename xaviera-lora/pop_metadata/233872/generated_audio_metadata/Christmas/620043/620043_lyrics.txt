Such a beautiful Christmas
At the Johnson's old farm
We were only'bout seven
Full of holiday charm
Searching catalogs for dolls and a BB gun
To find a gift for you was so much fun
I took you shopping for Christmas
With your catalog dreams
Shopping, hopping together
As your happy face bleeds
I took you shopping for Christmas
With your jingle bell rings
Santa flies in December
So bring your catalog dreams
Now it's twenty years later
Holidays are the same
We're flipping photos together
And maybe hair colors changed
Searching catalogs for dolls and a BB gun
Now fighting ghosts for kids is really fun
I'll take you shopping for Christmas
With your catalog dreams
Shopping, hopping, to gabbing
As your happy face beams
I'll take you shopping for Christmas
Where your jingle bell rings
Santa flies in December
So bring your catalog dreams
