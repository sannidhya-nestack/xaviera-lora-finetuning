City streets with lights so bright
Sparkling in the winter night
Joyful voices, bells that chime
It's the perfect Christmas time
Every heart feels light and free
Filled with festive energy
Holiday magic in the air
Laughing laughter everywhere
Gather close feel the cheer
The best time of the year
Families gather round the tree
Sharing love and memories
Candles glow, a warm embrace
Happiness on every face
Every heart feels light and free
Filled with festive energy
Holiday magic in the air
Love and laughter everywhere
Gather close, feel the cheer
The best time of the year
Send all these stars above, twinkling bright
Guiding us through this magical night
Hold on tight, never let go
Feel the wonder, let it show
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Holiday magic in the air
Oh oh
Holiday magic in the air
Love and laughter everywhere
Got her close, feel the cheer
The best time of the year
Holiday dreams coming true
All because of me and you
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Holiday magic in the air, love and laughter everywhere, gather close, feel the cheer
The best time of the year, the best time of the year, yeah
Holiday dreams come true, all because of me and you
