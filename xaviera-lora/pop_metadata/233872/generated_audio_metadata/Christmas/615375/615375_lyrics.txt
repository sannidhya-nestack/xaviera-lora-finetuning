It's almost Christmas
And all I see is snow
Falling down
My number one wish is
Hoping you'll be home
The tree's decorated
And the mistletoe is hung
You're all I want for Christmas
And nothing else will do
It's not really Christmas
When it's Christmas without you
It's almost Christmas (almost Christmas)
I don't want to be alone (don't want to be alone)
How soon can you get here?
Tell me you're leaving now (are you leaving now?) (leaving now)
'Cause you're all I want for Christmas
And nothing else will do
It's not really Christmas
When it's Christmas without you
I can see us holding hands
Walking through a cool winter wonderland
Christmas caroling
Hear the sleigh bells ring
On a horse ride in the snow
I think it's time to find that mistletoe
Come on home
Tell me you're leaving now
Leaving now
you're all I want for Christmas
And nothing else will
And nothing else, nothing else will do, oh
It's not really Christmas (it's not really Christmas)
When it's Christmas (you're all I want for Christmas)
It's not really Christmas (when it's Christmas)
You're all I want for Christmas (it's not really Christmas)
When it's Christmas (you're all I want for Christmas)
Christmas
