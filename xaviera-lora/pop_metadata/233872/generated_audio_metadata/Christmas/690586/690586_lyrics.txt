Good King Wenceslas looked out on the feast of Stephen
When the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even
Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came inside, gathering winter fuel
Hither page and stand by me
If you know, please tell me
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?
Sorry, there's a goodly hence
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By St. Agnes' fountain
Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I will see'em dine
When we bear them thither
Age and mod of forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude winds, wild lament
And the bitter weather
In his master's steps he trod, where the snow lay dinted
He was in the very saw which the saints had printed
Therefore Christian men be sure, wealth or rank will set sink
He who now will bless the poor shall yourselves find, bless, and sing
