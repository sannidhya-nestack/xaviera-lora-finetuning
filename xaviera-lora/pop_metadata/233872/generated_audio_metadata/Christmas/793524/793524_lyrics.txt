I don't need mistletoe
I don't need brand new clothes
I don't need pretty packages with bows
I don't care if it snows
Whether it's hot or cold
'Cause all I want to see beneath my tree is you
You ask me what I want for Christmas
You say you're going shopping
And you'd like to get me something special this year
Well hey, you're something special to me
As far as I'm concerned
Everything I need
Is already here
No, I don't need mistletoe
I don't need brand new clothes
I don't need pretty packages with bows
I don't care if it snows
Or whether it's hot or cold
all I want to see
Beneath my tree
Sure we all want peace on earth and good will to men
But if I were you I wouldn't hold my breath
You don't have to make a list
You don't have to check it twice
As long as you're with me
My world's just fine
I don't need mistletoe
I don't need brand new clothes
I don't need pretty packages with loads
I don't care if it snows or whether it's hot or cold
all I wanna see
Beneath my trees
Is you
