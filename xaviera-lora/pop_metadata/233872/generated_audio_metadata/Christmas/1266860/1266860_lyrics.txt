Christmas is
Twinkling magic in the frosty night
Every moment we feel so right
Snowflakes dancing in the silent sky
Christmas year
Doesn't it feel like we're the only ones
Wrapped in love'til the morning comes
Christmas means
Celebrating with you
All these dreams come true
Mistletoe, sharing secrets in the fireside glow
With the wishes of the world we'll know
Hand in hand on the stars we'll go
Holding tight, with every hug and melt the ice
You and me in this paradise
Christmas leaves
Celebrated with you, ooh
All these dreams come true
In your arms I find my peace
Every moment tender and loose
With you beside my heart's at ease
A love so strong it never ceases
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Christmas needs
Celebrating with you, ooh
All these dreams coming true
In your arms I find my peace
Every moment a tender release
With you beside my heart's at ease
Love grows stronger never cease
Christmas means celebrating with you
All these dreams coming true
