Joy to the world, the Lord has come
Let earth receive her King
Free heart, prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing (and heaven and nature sing)
And heaven and nature sing (and heaven and nature sing)
And heaven, and heaven, and nature
Joy to the world, the Savior reigns Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains Repeat
Repeat the sounding joy, repeat the sounding joy, repeat the sounding joy, repeat the sounding joy.
He rules the world with truth and grace and makes the nations prove.
The glories of His righteousness, and wonders of His love, and wonders of His love, and wonders, wonders of His love. Joy to the world!
The Lord has come.
