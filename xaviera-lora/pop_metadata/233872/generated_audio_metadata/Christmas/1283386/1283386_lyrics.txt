Holly lights are sparkling fast
Snowflakes dancing dreams that last
Waiting for that jingle's chime
Santa's grooving in no time
Cookies out and milk to sip
Hoping Santa won't just skip
Up the chimney toss and turn
For a sack of joy we earn
Ho ho ho he's coming around
Swinging sleigh bells rocking sound
Through the night we sway and sing
Santa's bringing everything
Elves are packing all the cheer
Flying reindeer geared to steer
Presents wrapped in red and green
Magic filling every scene
Hear his footsteps on the roof
Reindeer hooves that never goof
Chimney clatter ain't a fuss
Santa dancing in with us
Ho ho ho he's coming around
Swinging sleigh bells rocking sound
Through the night we sway and sing
Santa's bringing everything
Doves are packing all the cheer
Flying reindeer geared to steer
Presents wrapped in red and green
Magic filling every scene
Here's footsteps on the roof
Reindeer hooves that never goof
Chimney clatter ain't a fuss
Santa dancing in with us
Ho ho ho he's coming'round
Swinging sleigh bells rocking sound
Through the night we sway and sing
Santa's bringing everything
