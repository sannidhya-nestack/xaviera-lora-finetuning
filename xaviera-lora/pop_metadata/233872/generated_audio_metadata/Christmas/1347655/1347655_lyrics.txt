Fa-la-la-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la-la-la falling
Fa-la-la-la-la-La, fa-la-la-la-la falling
Fallin', fallin', fallin'
Like the snow in love again
Don't know the last time
We've been this close to fallin', fallin'
Lights glow in windows
Darkness disappears
Silver bells ring in our ears
Reindeer and angels appear
Christmas time is here
Fallin', fallin', fallin'
Like the snow in love again
I don't know the last time
We've been this close to fallin'
Fallin', fallin', fallin'
The band's playing songs of holidays long gone
We're standing'neath the mistletoe singing along
Red and green decor on every wall and every door
And it's Christmas time once more
It's Christmas time, Christmas time
And I'm falling, falling, falling
Like the snow in love again
I don't know the last time
We've been this close to fallin'
Fall-a-la-la-la-la, fall-a-la-la-la-la fallin'
Fall-a-la-la-la-La, fall-a-la-la-la, fallin'
