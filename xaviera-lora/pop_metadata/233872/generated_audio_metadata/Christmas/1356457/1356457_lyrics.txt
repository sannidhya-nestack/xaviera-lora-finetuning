Hail the blessed morn, see the great Mediator
Down from the regions of glory descend
Shepherds go worship the babe in the manger
Love for his guard the bright angels attend
Brightest and best are the suns of the morning
Dawn on our darkness and lend us thine aid
Star in the east, the horizon adorning
Guide where our infant redeemer is laying
Cold on his cradle, the dew drops are shining
Low lies his bed with the beasts of the stall
Angels adore him in slumbers reclining
Wise men and shepherds before him knew fall
Brightest and best are the suns of the morning
Dawn on our darkness and lend us thy name
Star in the East, the
Horizon adorning
Guide where our infant Redeemer is laid
Vainly we offer each ample oblation,
Vainly with gold we his favour secure.
Richer by far is the heart's adoration
Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor
Brightest and best of all suns of the morning
Dawn on our darkness and lend us thy name
Sun of the morning
The horizon adorning guide where our infant Redeemer is laid
