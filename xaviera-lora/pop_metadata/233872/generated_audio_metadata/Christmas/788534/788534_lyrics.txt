Go, go talent on the mountains
Go, go tell it on the mountains that Jesus Christ is born
Go, go tell it on the mountains
Go, go tell it on the mountains that Jesus Christ is born
Down in a lonely manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent the salvation
That blessed Christmas morning
Go, go tell it on the mountains
Go, go tell it on the mountains
That Jesus Christ is born
I sing go, go, go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, go tell it on the mountains that Jesus Christ is born
When I was a seeker
I sought both night and day
I asked the Lord to help me
And believe it or not
He showed me this way
I sing go, I sing go, go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountains that Jesus Christ is born
That Jesus Christ is born
That Jesus Christ is born
