Tinsel drapes on evergreen
Shining bright a festive scene
Windows framed with snowy lace
Christmas magic in this place
Hush voices hear the cheer
Love and joy Christmas near
Tinsel and twinkle lights aglow
Bringing warmth in the cold
In this wonderland hearts will know
Christmas love pure and bold
Chimney smoke and frosty air
Laughter shared without a care
Bells that chime with every beat
Echoing through snowy streets
Hushed voices hear the cheer
Love and joy, Christmas near
Tinsel and twinkle lights of glow
Bringing warmth in the cold
In this wonderland hearts will know
Christmas love pure and bold
Chimney smoke and frosty air
Laughter shared without a care
Bells that shine with every beat
Echoing through snowy streets
Hushed voices hear the cheer
Love and joy, Christmas near
Stars above, they guide the way
To where our dreams and wishes lay
Wrapped in blankets, whispered soft
In this season, we get lost
Tinsel and twinkle lights aglow
Bringing warmth in the cold
In this wonderland hearts will know
Christmas love pure and bold
