Silent night (silent night)
Holy night (holy night)
All is calm
All is bright
Round yon virgin
Mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night
Holy night (holy night)
Son of God (ah)
Who loves pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Oh sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
