We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain
Moor and mountain
Following yonder star
Oh star of wonder
Star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Born a king on Bethlehem's plain
Gold I bring to crown him again
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign
Oh star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Born a king on Bethlehem's plain
Gold I bring to crown him again
King forever
Ceasing never
Over us all to reign
Oh
Frankincense to offer have I
Incense owns a deity night
Prayer and praising
Voices raising
Worshipping God on high
O star of wonder
Star of night
Star of royal beauty bright
Westward leading
Still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume
Breathes a life of gathering gloom
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying
Sealed in the stone cold tomb, oh
Glorious now behold Him arise
King and God in sacrifice
Alleluia, alleluia
Sounds through the earth and skies
Oh
