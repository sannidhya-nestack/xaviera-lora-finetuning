Underneath the winter sky
Snowflakes dance, our spirits high
Evergreens in silent rows
Whisper secrets only we know
Candles flicker in the night
Guiding us with gentle all-night
Evergreen dreams pure and true
In this season, me and you
Wrapped in wonder how it's a glow
Christmas magic in the snow
Crimson ribbons gifts adorn
Memories of joy reborn
Laughter shed by the fireside
With you here loves our guide
Candles flicker in the night
Guiding us with gentle our light
Evergreen dreams pure and true
In this season, me and you
Wrapped in wonder how to glow
Christmas magic in the snow
Crimson ribbons gifts adorn
Memories of joy reborn
Laughter shared by the fireside
With you here loves our guides
Crimson ribbons gifts adorn
Memories of joy reborn
Evergreen dreams pure and true
In this season, me and you
Wrapped in wonder, hearts aglow
Christmas magic in the snow
Underneath the mistletoe
Softly in the fire's glow
Promises we make tonight
Bound by love pure and bright
Evergreen dreams pure and true
In this season me and you
Wrapped in wonder, hearts aglow
Christmas magic in the snow
