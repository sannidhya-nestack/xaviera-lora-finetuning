Christmas means celebrating with you
Under twinkling lights our love shines bright
We gather on the fire warm and true
Singing carols holding each other tight
Snowflakes fall, so soft a magical hue
In your arms everything feels so right
It's Christmas City, it's you
My heart finds its home in the songs we sing
In this joyous season you're my everything
Forever true, Christmas with you
Can't close the love we hide
Can't explode the love in every part
The memories we share, they'll never depart
The heavens seal this baby's snow noir
Stomp, stomp, stomp in your life
While my Christmas spirits spark
It's Christmas, it tickets you
My heart finds its home in the songs we sing
In this joyous season you're my everything
Forever true, Christmas with you
Your smile lights up the room geared to light
Together we make every moment feel so bright
No matter the weather our love feels just right
My Christmas wishes you every night
It's Christmas, it's you
My heart finds its home in the songs we sing
In this joyous season you're my everything forever true
Christmas with you
