Dashing through the snow, in one horse open sleigh
And o'er the fields we go, laughing all the way
The bells on bobtail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in one horse open sleigh
Day or two ago I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank Miss Fortune seemed his lot
He got into
A drifted bank and we, we got upset
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Oh jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in one horse open sleigh
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take a ride tonight
And sing this sleighing song
Just get above Tilt-Bay, 240 for his speed
Then hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack, he'll take the lead
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Oh, what fun it is to ride in one horse open sleigh, oh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
In a one-horse open sleigh
In a one-horse open sleigh
