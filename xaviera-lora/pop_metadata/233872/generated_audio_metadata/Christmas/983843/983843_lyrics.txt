Hey, look at all that white
Missed the snow last night
It's gonna make a good excuse
For kissing by the fireplace with you
So let it snow
Is it the big red bulls or the mistletoe
That put the fall-a-la-love in the air?
Baby, baby, I don't really care if Santa knows
Presents wrapped up under the tree
You're the only present for me
Wrapped under your sweater
Can't get any better
So in case I never let go
Lay made on the snow
Every time we touch
Lame it on the cold
If I say too much
the carols are sung in the warmth of your arms
It's music to my ears
Lame it on the snow
When we can blame it on the cold (If I fall in love)
I can't control it when chestnuts are roasting
And it's that time of year to blame it on the snow
Pickin' snowball fights, makin' angels fly
Even if it's only in the yard
And the Christmas lights reflectin' in your eyes
Stars to melt my heart out
Presents wrapped up under the tree
You're the only present for me
Wrapped under your sweater
Can't get any better
So in case I never let go
Blame it on the snow (Every time we touch)
Blame it on the cold (If I say too much)
we can't run this song in the warmth of your arms
It's music to my ear
Blame it on the snow
When we cuddle, I blame it on the cold (If I fall in love)
I can't control it when chestnuts are roasting
And it's that time of year
Blame it on all the presents under the tree
You're the only one that I need
You and me together, I'll never ever let go
Blame it on the sound (Every time we touch)
Blame it on the cold (If I say too much)
it can't help the song, you know what?
your eyes, it's music to my ears
Hear the sound (Blame it on the sound)
(Keepin' me in the car)
Baby don't go, yeah (yes I'm flyin')
Who gives a? Can't control it, but just, it's erosin'
And it's that time of year (I need just somethin' about it)
Baby don't go (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby don't go (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh yeah, yeah
