On a mid-December evening, the world turns white
Footprints in the powder, beneath silver light
Children's laughter echoing down the lane
The snowflakes dance like sugar cane
Snow angels and starlight
Guide us through this holy night
Bells are ringing soft and clear
Magic's in the atmosphere
Christmas time's drawing near
One cup was steaming in grandma's cup
Red ribbons and tinsel as hopes lift up
Candlelight glowing and window panes
While winter's music plays in frames
Snow angels and starlight
Guide us through this holy night
Bells are ringing soft and clear
Magic's in the atmosphere
Christmas time's drawing near
Warm cocoa steaming in grandma's cup
Red ribbons and tinsel as hopes lift up
Candlelight glowing in windowpanes
While winter's music plays in frames
Snow angels and starlight
Guide us through this holy night
Bells are ringing soft and clear
Magic's in the atmosphere
Christmas time is drawing near
Every heartbeat's warmer tonight
Every soul shines just a bit brighter
As we gather close to the fire
The love left is higher and higher
Snow angels and starlight
Guide us through this holy night
Bells are ringing soft and clear
Magic's in the atmosphere
Christmas time is drawing near
Every heartbeat's warmer tonight
Every soul shines just a bit brighter
As we gather close to the fire
Let love lift us higher and higher
Mm, snow angels and starlight
Guide us through this holy night
Bells are ringing soft and clear
Magic's in the atmosphere
Christmas time is here
