Like walking downstairs on Christmas morning
That's how I feel with you
Wide-eyed child with a great big smile
That lasts the whole year through
You're the gift on the top of my list
Oh what a dream come true
Like walking downstairs on Christmas morning
That's how I feel with you
'Cause your love decorates me like a Christmas tree
With a shining star on top
Under mistletoe every place we go
Your kisses never stop
And I just can't wait to wake up each day
And play like little kids do
Like walking downstairs on Christmas morning
That's how I feel with you
Like walking downstairs on Christmas morning
That's how I feel with you
You're my Johnny on F I'm beside myself with toys all shiny and new
The days are bright all the world is right and I'll never ever be blue
Like walking downstairs on Christmas morning
That's how I feel with you
Like walking downstairs on Christmas morning
That's how I feel with you
A wide-eyed child with a great big smile that'll last the whole year through
You're the gift on the top of my list, oh what a dream come true
Like walking downstairs on Christmas morning, that's how I feel with you
Like walking downstairs on Christmas morning
Like walking downstairs on Christmas morning
Like walking downstairs on Christmas morning
That's how I feel with you
