[Silence]
Catching snowflakes with bare hands
Catching warmth with clear heart
Catching your eye door of far away lands
Catching sight of what's my part
I've got Christmas on my mind
Never knew I'd hit rewind
I wonder what it holds within any shrine
On the other side what I'd find
I've got Christmas on my mind
Never knew peace of this kind
I wonder when I'll stay in the light
On the other side with you entwined
Fetching firewood to keep me warm
Fetching thoughts of you which make me smile
Fetching memories does me no harm
Fetching some cocoa while I wait a while
I got Christmas on my mind
Never knew I'd hit rewind
I wonder what it holds within enshrined
On the other side what I'd find
I've got Christmas all night
There's a new piece of the sky
I wonder when I'll stay at night
On the other side with you and twilight
