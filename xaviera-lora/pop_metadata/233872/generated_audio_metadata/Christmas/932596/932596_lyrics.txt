O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night
Divine, all night
When Christ was born
All night, divine
All night, all night divine
Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall he break, for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy
In grateful chorus raise we, let all within us praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord, let it be
Every brother praise we
His power and glory evermore proclaim
(Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm)
(Mmm)
Sweet hymns of joy
In grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us
Praise His holy name
Fall on your knees
Oh hear
Hear the angel voices all night divine
All night when Christ was born all night divine
O night, O night divine
