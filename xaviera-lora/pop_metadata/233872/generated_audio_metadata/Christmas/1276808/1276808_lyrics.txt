Under the mistletoe, bright lights sway
Snow falls gently while the dance cats play
Rhythm's talking like a reindeer's hooves
Let's dance and jive in our winter grooves
Candy canes hanging stockings in line
Each note captures the holiday shine
Frosty windows with a cozy glow
Swing to the beat of the falling snow
So let's mix up the Christmas cheer with a smooth beat that's oh so clear
Jingle bells and a retro vibe, feel the lo-fi in every scribe
Old time records spin with a crackle, little elves join the swing battle
Send the sleigh ride through the sky, jazz beats take us way up high
Twinkly lights on the city streets
Every corner jumps to swing beats
Snowflakes twirl in the evening light
Electro swing makes the season bright
So let's mix up the lip-b-b-b-b-b-bada-bada-bada-bada
So let's mix up the Christmas cheer with a smooth beat that's oh so clear
Jingle bells and a retro vibe feel the lo-fi in every sky
So let's mix up the Christmas cheer
So let's mix up the Christmas cheer
With a smooth beat that's oh so clear
Jingle bells and a retro vibe
Feel the lo-fi in every scribe
