Riding on a rainbow train
Through the skies past the rain
Chasing stars we break the mold
To the North Pole's heart of gold
Snowflakes dancing in the night
Shimmering in silver light
Reindeer fly we're on our way
Wishing wells lead this way
Santa's workshop full of cheer
Toyland magic drawing near
Jingle bells and elven chimes
Lost in wonder winter rhymes
Candy canes and sugar plum trees
Winter whispers in the breeze
Cookies baking on the line
Elves are working by the line
Northern lights they paint the sky
Dreams take wing we can't deny
Ice castles glimmer so bright
Journeying through the endless night
Santa's workshop full of cheer
Toyland magic drawing near
Jingle bells and elven chimes
Lost in wonder winter eyes
