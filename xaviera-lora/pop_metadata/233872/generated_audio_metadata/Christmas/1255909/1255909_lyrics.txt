In the sky bright stars shine
It's Christmas Eve just about nine
Santa Claus is on his way
Coming with a shiny sleigh
Christmas time, oh, Christmas time
You're the best, we're here to shine
Gifts and joy and the Christmas pine
All is merry and so fine
Christmas tree with lights so bright
Shines in our home, oh what a sight
Underneath gifts wrapped tight
Oh can't wait'til it's Christmas night
Jingle bells, oh, jingle bells
Listen to the story tell
Of Santa reindeer and magic spells
Merry Christmas, the chorus yells
We go to bed with hearts so light
Thank you, Santa, for this night
Under blankets, cozy and tight
Merry Christmas to all sleep tight
We go to bed with hearts so light
Thank you Santa for this night
Under blankets cozy and tight
Merry Christmas to all sleep tight
