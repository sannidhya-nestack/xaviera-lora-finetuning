When it's Christmas time
So happy that I'm not in Canada
While the palm trees sway
The sun shines all day in the Caribbean
Got no Christmas tree down by the sea
But nobody's sad
Cause here comes the Rasta Santa man
Flying overhead with his reindeer
Here comes the Rasta Santa man
Bringing everybody his good cheer
In his bright red socks and dangling dreadlocks
He sings ho ho hey
All the girls and boys will open their toys when he packs his sleigh
All his little elves sing to themselves this cool melody
Here comes the Rasta Santa man (Yeah man here I come)
Flying overhead with his reindeer
Here comes the Rasta Santa man (Sing everybody)
Bringing everybody his good cheers
We don't have no snow outside the bungalow
And who needs mistletoe
If we can kiss beneath the rainbow
As we drink some rum
And hug everyone
Hear the guitars strum
Santa man sing song
While jamming along
On the steel pan drum
See the first stars shine
It's Christmas time
Everybody's singing
Here comes the Rasta Santa man
Flying overhead with his reindeer
Here comes the Rasta Santa man
All the children glad that he comes here
Here comes the Rasta Santa man
Flying overhead with his reindeer
Here comes the Rasta Santa man
Bringing everybody his good cheer
Here comes the Rasta Santa man
Flying overhead with his reindeer
Here comes the Rasta Santa Maria
