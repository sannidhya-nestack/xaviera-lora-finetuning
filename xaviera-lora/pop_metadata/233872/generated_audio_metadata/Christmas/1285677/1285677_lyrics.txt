Canada has bling now, ice on the sway
DJ drop the beat, North Pole no delay
Elves on the dance floor, stockings in the air
Club turns to magic, merry-rim everywhere
Christmas lights flash, reindeer on the sneakers
Eggnog served, red cups for the sneakers
Snow face falling in a winter wonderland
Face so hot, melt the snow where we stand
Jingle bells rockin', beats so ferocious
Mistletoe moments move so precocious
Rudolph on the mic, sit and marry rhymes
Gift wrap cadence, chorus and perfect rhyme
Santa on the turntable scratchin' holiday cheer
Two step with the swag and carols in our ears
Grinch can feel the vibe, now piss you tight
Celebration supreme, holiday pride
Rock whole fashion, dapper in lead green
Elf got the swagger, dance floor's the scene
Fireplace burning, frosty looking slide
Hot chocolate shots, marshmallows to the sky
Christmas lights flash, reindeer on the speakers
Eggnog to breadcrumbs on the sneakers
Snow face falling in a winter wonderland
Face so hot, melted snow where we stand
Jingle bells, mocking beats so ferocious
Mistletoe moments, moves so precocious
Smooth off on the mic, spitting merry rhymes
Bass so hot, melting snow where we stand
