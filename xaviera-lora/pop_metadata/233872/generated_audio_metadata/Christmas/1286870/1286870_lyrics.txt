Silent whispers round the tree tonight
Snowflakes falling in the soft moonlight
Carols echo through the chilly air
Wonder dances everywhere
Gliss and tinsel like the stars that glow
Every corner lit by candles glow
Laughter bubbling like the hot cocoa
Hearts as warm as the embers slow
Underneath the Christmas moon
Fiends of December come so often
Wrapped in blankets, holding tight
Magic paints a peaceful night
Ornaments reflecting joy so bright
Rain displaying in the light
Gifts and secrets to unfold
Memories more precious than gold
Mistletoe above where moments last
Savory, the seasons spell so fast
Unwrapping love and a merry cheer
Christmas moonlight's all we hold dear
Underneath the Christmas moon
Dreams of December come so soon
Wrapped in blankets holding tight
Magic place, a peaceful night
