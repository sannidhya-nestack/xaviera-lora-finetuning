Frosty with no pain, streets lined with snow
Tinsel and lights set the town aglow
You take my hand, we start to walk
Through winter's wonderland, no need to talk
It's December spell, can't you feel it too?
Magic in the air, just me and you
Snowflakes falling, hearts are calling
This Christmas feeling, it must be true
Hot cocoa steam, warm in our hands
Cuddled up close as the fire expands
Whispers of love, soft as the night
Under mistletoe, everything's right
It's December spell, can't you feel it too?
Magic in the air, just me and you
Snowflakes falling, hearts are calling
This Christmas feeling, it must be true
Let's make a wish, on the star above
For endless winters, filled with love
In your arms, I'm finally home
A perfect Christmas, ours alone
It's December spell, can't you feel it too?
Magic in the air, just me and you
Snowflakes falling, hearts are calling
This Christmas feeling, it must be true
It's December spell, me and you
This Christmas feeling, forever true
