Mary, holy night of God's glory
See this baby, Jesus, pure and whole
Mary, Mary, holy night of God's glory
Baby Jesus, pure and holy
We have come from so far away
And now we see the king
Won't let us go astray
A child is born
A new era has begun
His name is Emmanuel
It's the first Noel
It's the first Noel
Mary, Mary
Holy Light of God's glory
Sing
This may be Jesus, pure and holy
