There's a little more jingle in my step tonight
My heart's lit up like a string of lights that dance around the tree
There's a little more tingle and it's not the cold
I feel like a grown up five year old waiting on Christmas Eve
Oh, I got a Christmas crush
When I think of us
Yeah, it's like the sky keeps pouring down magic dust
Oh, I got a Christmas crush
It's almost too much
Yeah, you're my 24 /7 sugar rush
Oh, I, I, I got a Christmas crush
I, I, I got a Christmas crush
I, I, I got a Christmas crush
I, I, I got a Christmas crush
It's only been ten days or so
But we can't walk past that mistletoe without that one more kiss
We can keep each other warm
Wrap me up inside your arms
You're my favorite top of the list
Just gotta have gift, oh I, I, I got a Christmas scratch
When I think of us
Yeah, it's like the sky keeps pouring down magic dust
Oh, I got a Christmas crush
It's almost too much
Yeah, you're like my 24 /7 sugar rush
Oh, I got a Christmas crush
I got a Christmas crush, I-I
I got a Christmas crush, I-I
I got a Christmas crush
Ooh
Oh, I got a Christmas crush
When I think of us
Yeah, it's like the sky keeps pouring down magic dust
Oh, I got a Christmas crush
It's almost too much
Yeah, you're like my 24 /7 sugar rush
Oh, I, I
Oh I, I, I got a Christmas crush
I, I, I got a Christmas crush
I, I, I got a Christmas crush
I, I, I got a Christmas crush
I, I, I got a Christmas crush
I, I, I got a Christmas crush
I, I, I got a Christmas crush
I, I, I got a Christmas crush
I've got a Christmas present for you.
