Snow is falling, lights are bright
Sleep bells ringing through the night
Pants and feet on frosty street
Swinging to that jolly beat
Candy cane and hot cocoa
Mary Fox, we let it flow
Tinsel trees and window frames
Swinging tunes in festive flames
Jingle, jangle, round we go
Twist and turn in golden glow
Snap your fingers, clap your hands
Feel the rhythm of the band
Rolling twenties meets your tie
Sparkling cheer we can't hide
Flapper hats and Christmas lights
Glitter glows on chilly nights
Snowflakes falling soft and white
Grooving in the winter light
Every heart is full of cheer
Bringing joy and drawing near
Jingle, jangle round we go
Twist and turn in golden glow
Snap your fingers, clap your hands
Feel the rhythm of the band
