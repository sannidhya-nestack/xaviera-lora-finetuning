Fire's burning warm in silence
I'm under the covers in its embrace
Thinking'bout the magic that's around us
The glow of the embers reflects in your eyes
I don't need a single gift without you
Tonight's a special time, love in the winter time
Snowflakes glistening bright, but still I hold the topic blue
I wonder what's funny, by the lights of the tree
Hearts a glow, you're what you gotta do
Every moment sparks are dancing
In front of the fire holding you near
Listening to the whispers of the snowfall
The warmth of your heartbeat, it's all that I need
I don't want a memory without you
Ooh, tonight's a fossil type
Of in the wintertime snowflakes moving
A few escaped to radite, a mesentery
The bread it brought to play
Let's make this moment last
Tied with the ribbon's cast
In the glow of the firelight
Melting the cold tonight
Tonight's a special time
It's a bit of a weird time
Snowflakes glistening bright
But till I hold you tight
We'll be gloomy, we'll scream Rambodin
I want you to watch for me
By the lights of the tree
