Snow falls gently on the street
Light shine bright can't feel my feet
Driving home it's been too long
Christmas Eve where we belong
Warm fireplace, hear the cheer
Family laughter, feel them near
Gift wrapped dreams and mistletoe
Holidays where love will grow
Coming home for Christmas night
Stars above our hearts ignite
Together now in love's embrace
Christmas Eve we'll find our place
Voices blend in harmony
Male, female in melody
Whisper softly carol song
Welcome home we're never gone
Travel far but always close
Family ties we'll never lose
Holiday spirit brings us close
Coming home love overflows
Coming home for Christmas night
Stars above our hearts ignite
Together now in love's embrace
Christmas Eve we'll find our place
Travel far but always close
Family ties we'll never lose
Holiday spirit brings us close
Coming home love overflows
Coming home for Christmas night
Stars above our hearts ignite
Gather now in love's embrace
Christmas Eve we'll find our place
Ooh
