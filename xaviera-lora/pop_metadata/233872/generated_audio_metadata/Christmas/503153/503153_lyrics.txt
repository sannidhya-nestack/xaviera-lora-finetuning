Joy to the world, the Lord has come
Let earth receive her King
Every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing
Joy to the world, the Savior
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains Repeat the sounding joy, repeat the sounding joy Repeat, repeat the sounding joy
He rules the world with truth and grace and makes the nation prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love, and wonders of His love, and wonders, wonders of His love
Joy to the world
The Lord has come
