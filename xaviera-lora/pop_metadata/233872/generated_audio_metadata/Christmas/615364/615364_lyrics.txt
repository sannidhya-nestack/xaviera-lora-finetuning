We three kings of Ori and Tar
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star, oh ho
Star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Born a king on Bethlehem's plain
Gold I bring to crown him again
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign
Oh, star of wonder
Star of night, star with a royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Frankincense to offer have I
Incense owns a deity nigh
Prayer and praising, all men praising
Worship Him, God Most High
Oh, oh
Star of wonder, star of night
Star with a royal beauty bright
A westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Myrrh is mine, it's bitter perfume
Breeze of life, of gathering gloom
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying
Buried in stone cold tomb
Star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Glorious now, behold Him arise
King and God and sacrifice
Alleluia, alleluia
Heaven to earth replies
O star of wonder, star of night
I start with a royal beauty bride
Westward leading still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Guide us to thy perfect light
