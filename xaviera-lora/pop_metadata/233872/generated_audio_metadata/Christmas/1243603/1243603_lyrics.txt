The angels are singing, the sleigh bells are ringing
Santa is coming, the reindeer are running
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
The angels are singing, the sleigh bells are ringing
Santa is coming, the reindeer are running
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
No faults from the sky
And all your friends are passing by
You know it's going to be
The best time of the year
The best time of the year

The sleigh bells are ringing

The reindeer are running
Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year
The angels are singing, the sleigh bells are ringing
Santa is coming, the reindeer are running
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
Snow falls from the sky
And all your friends are passing by
You know it's going to be
The best time of the year
The best time of the year
The angels are singing
The sleigh bells are ringing
Santa is coming
The reindeer are running
Merry Christmas and a happy new year
