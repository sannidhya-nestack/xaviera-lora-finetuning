I saw three ships come sailing in on Christmas day, on Christmas day
I saw three ships come sailing in on Christmas day in the morning
I saw three ships come sailing in on Christmas day on Christmas day
I saw three ships come sailing in on Christmas day
And what was in the ships on Christmas day, on Christmas day?
And what was in the ships on Christmas day in the morning?
A Virgin Mary, a Christ the Lamb, in Christmas Day, in Christmas Day
A Virgin Mary, a Christ the Lamb, on Christmas Day in the morning
Pray, will I sail the ships of thee on Christmas day, on Christmas day?
Pray, will I sail the ships of thee on Christmas day in the morning?
Or lay sailing to be free there on Christmas day, on Christmas day?
Or lay sailing to be free there on Christmas day?
And all the bells on earth shall ring on Christmas day, on Christmas day
And all the bells on earth shall ring on Christmas day in the morning
And all the angels in heaven shall sing in Christmas day, in Christmas day
And all the angels in heaven shall sing
O Christmas Day, come good will, O Christmas Day, come good will
Then let us all rejoice again, O Christmas Day, O Christmas Day
Then let us all rejoice again, O Christmas Day, come good
It comes daily in the morning, Christmas day in the morning
