Snow was falling
Family gathered round a Christmas tree
With stockings one for you and one for me
And nothing in the world could ever come between
But now everything has changed
Everything has changed
I hope the coming year will bring you back to me
It's been a lonely Christmas Eve
Mother's calling
To the kids out playing in the snow
There's dinner on the table, good to go
The holidays may pass us by before we know
But now
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
I hope the coming year will bring you back to me
It's been a lonely Christmas Eve
I miss you
And there is none to rescue
I miss you most of all
This Christmas Eve
