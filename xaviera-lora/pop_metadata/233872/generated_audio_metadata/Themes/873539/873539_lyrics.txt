Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a slaying song tonight
Hey jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Hey jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago, thought I'd make a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bride was seated by my side
The horse was mean and lank, Miss Fortune seemed disloved
He got into a drifted bang and then we got upset
Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse, one horse, one horse open sleigh
