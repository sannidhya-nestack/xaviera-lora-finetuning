Yo, gather'round, let me tell you a tale
that one fam member who never fails
Every holiday they come with a plan
They snatch up the leftovers like a food stealing van
They walk in the kitchen with a grin so wide
Eyes locked on the tupperware, nowhere to hide
Turkey, ham, mashed potatoes too
They like a food ninja striking out of the blue
Leftover bandit, they strike again
Taking all the food it's a holiday sin
All we love and still can't help but smile
And only leave us hungry for a while
Oh, they leave us hungry for a while
They'll sweep through the party with a stealthy glide
On a mission from left, always they can't be denied
Ponti's famous pie, grandma's secret stew
They'll pack it up quick like they're part of a crew
With tumbleware stacked up to ceiling high
They'll dash out the door like the FBI
Leaving us all wondering what just occurred
As we stare at the empty dishes
Left over, bandit, they strike again
Taking all the food and time and they say
All we know and still can't help but smile
And though they leave us hungry for a while
They leave us hungry for a while
And like a food vacuum, sucking up the feast
Leaving us all hungry, not in the least
But hey, that's family first and all
Even if they're the ones who make us feel small
So here's to that fan member with the leftovers in tow
They may leave us hungry but we'll never let go
They're part of the crew in their own special way
And we wouldn't have it any other way
Yeah, it's Dove or Bandit, they strike again
Taking all the food, it's a holiday sin
But we love'em, still can't help but smile
Even though they leave us hungry for a while
Oh, they leave us hungry for a while
