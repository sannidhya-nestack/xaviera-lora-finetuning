It's a long way home
It's a long way home
When you're on your own
When you're on your own
I know you're there with me, walking side by side
You carry me when I'm weak
When I stand on my two feet
Every step I take is towards eternity
On the road, yeah I'm on the road
To finally meet my soul, to finally meet my soul
I know you're there with me
Walk side by side
You carry me when I'm weak
When I stand on my two feet
Every step I take
Is towards eternity
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know you're there with me
Walking side by side
You carry me when I'm weak
When I stand on my two feet
Every step I take is towards eternity
