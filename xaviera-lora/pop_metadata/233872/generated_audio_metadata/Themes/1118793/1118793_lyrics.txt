The day we met, we'd never be apart
The day you left, I lost a piece of my heart
And I still reach across the room for you
The weeks pass and everything is empty
A broken soul induces how you left me
But I still can't move on to something new
You were the friend that I need
You were there in me
I can't go on what we had
You stand on my dreams
You will be the death of a man
I can't say no if you come back
But you won't
I hope the sun shines upon your face
I hope you smile and realize you miss me
And you'll show up at my front door
You'll cry and tell me that you're sorry
We'll kiss and have a happy ending
And my dreams will be just like before
Will be just like before, oh
No, it won't be just like before
