Time can go fast
And slow
You were there when I was born
When I go
Wish you didn't exist at all
And live the life I'm longing for
And I, I turn to thee
I got all that I want
Oh, but time, I can't leave you behind
You're all that I want
But time leaves it
Tears are broken glass
I'm tired of waking up and rise
And see the other side of you
You are so beautiful
I can't let go
You put emotion to this life
I love to live'cause I got all that I want
Oh, but time, I can't leave you behind
You're all that I want
But time
Better than to say I love you
Better than to say I do
Better than to say I love you
Cause I got time for you
I've got time for your bad times
You'll be by my side
And with the sunshine rolling high
You are so beautiful
I can't let go
Your pawn in motion, turning life, I love to live
I got all that I want, oh, but I
I can't leave you behind, you're all that I want
