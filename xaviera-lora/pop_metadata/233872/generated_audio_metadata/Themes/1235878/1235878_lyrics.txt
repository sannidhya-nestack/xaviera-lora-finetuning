Yeah I go walking down the same road
Must be now'bout a million times
But no matter which way I go
Still got the same stuff on my mind
Who am I? Where am I going?
Can anyone show me the way?
Who am I? Where am I going?
Tired of feeling like Groundhog Day
Maybe then I'd have a purpose
Maybe then I'd feel fine
Maybe then I'd be confident
Maybe I'll just wait in line
Maybe then I'd have a purpose
Maybe then I'd feel fine
Maybe then I'd be confident
Maybe I'll just wait in line
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
Or maybe I'll just keep on walking
Doesn't seem to matter much anyways
I'll never understand these creatures
Don't care much for what they say
Life filled with donuts and caffeine
I'm a fiend lost in these dreams
Make me wanna kick and scream
What does it mean, what does it mean?
Maybe then I'd have a purpose
Maybe then I'd feel fine
Maybe then I'd be confident
Maybe I'll just wait in line
Maybe then I'd have a purpose
Maybe then I'd feel fine
Maybe then I'd be confident
Maybe I'll just wait in line
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
I'll just keep walking, walking, walking, walking
I'll just keep walking, walking, working, working
I'll just keep walking, walking, walking, working
Maybe then I'd feel fine
Maybe then I'd be confident
Maybe I'll just wait in line
Maybe then I'd have a purpose
Maybe then I'd feel fine
Maybe then I'd be confident
Maybe I'll just wait in line
La la la la la la la la
I'll just keep walking
La, la, la, la, la, la, la-la-la-la-la, la
