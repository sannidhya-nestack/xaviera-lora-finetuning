We'll come a time
We will pay for our crimes
We'll love to fight
And we don't even ask why
Our generation
Lives into some desperate times we close our eyes
We keep on living in the past
Chains are broken, words unspoken
Endless tales of the human race
Do you think they're still?
Something worth fighting for
We can't wait anymore
Do you still believe?
Things can change in better ways
It's a matter of faith
You and I, we got no right to apologize
We waste our time, hearts are going to freeze
The highest tide, it will make us sacrifice
And human life has become just a ride
Chains are broken, words unspoken
Endless tales of the human race
Do you think they're still?
Something worth fighting for
We can't wait anymore
Do you still believe?
Things can change in better ways
It's a matter of faith
Chains are broken, words unspoken
Endless tales of the human race
Do you think there's still
Something worth fighting for
We can't wait anymore
Do you still believe
Things can change in better ways
It's a matter of faith
Do you think there's still something worth fighting for?
It's a matter of faith
Do you still believe that things can change in better ways?
Just a matter of faith
Only a matter of fate
Do you think there's still something worth fighting for?
We can't wait anymore
Do you still believe things can change in better ways?
