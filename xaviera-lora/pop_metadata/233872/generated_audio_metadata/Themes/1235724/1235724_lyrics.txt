I thought you would but I'm not even mad
I think about all the dreams that we had
I wait around until you appear
And you won't even know I'm here
I'll say your name all alone to myself
And I'll make sure you're for nobody else
Ready for an extended hand
Got no way you would understand
Such perfect fit in every bed, it's like it ain't split
To see you in that thong, it makes me laugh,'cause that's the wrong
And all time I'll take those, it's a purple, my glory old
So baby let those mountains swing
Your apathy is so perfectly clear
You look around but you don't know I'm near
I've been around for millennia
Got no pity for any of ya
Grab your means so you won't run away
I think about all the things that you'll say
Blur the line between good and bad
Got more time than I think I have
Lookin' up now, startin' five
Purified, I feel alive
Got no self control
Down below, watch it grow
Flowin' on my sides
Open wide, enjoy the ride
Just can't wait to taste your pretty face with fancy lace
You're up to get me now, show'em how, make'em proud
Ain't no one to blame for breaking the chain with a family name
So baby make those mountains sing
Lows have passed
Once again I'm last again
And I'm right on time
And you're already mine
Right on time
You're already mine
