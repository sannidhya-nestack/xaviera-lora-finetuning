You were there to guide my rising star
Watching every moment
I'm grateful you were there
Did I ever tell you I've been blessed
Mom, you're the best
You always cheered me on
For my games and my plays
And for all my ordinary days
You were there, you were there
You were there, together in my rising star
Watching every moment
I'm grateful you were there
Did I ever mention the love you possess Is greater than world success
And everyone agrees
Your kindness transcends
To your family and to all your friends
You were there, you were there
To guide my rising star
Watching every moment
I'm grateful (grateful)
You were there (you were there)
You were there (to guide my rising star)
Watching every moment
I'm grateful you were there
