I wanna tell you a little something
I got a premonition about you
I feel it in my heart
It's tearing me apart
Premonition
Can't put my finger on it
There's no way I can stop it
Premonition
I feel it deep inside
It's something I can't hide
Can't put my finger on it
No way that I can stop it
Premonition baby
I got a premonition
Premonition baby
I see it in my dreams
It's not quite what it seems
Eyes were fading fast
This love ain't gonna last
I see you less and less
Where you go I can only guess
Premonition
Can't put my finger on it
There's no way I can stop it
Premonition
It's written in the stars
Can only count the hours
Can't put my finger on it
No way that I can stop it
Premonition baby
I got a premonition
I got a premonition baby
I got a premonition
Got this premonition baby
I don't know what you're thinking but
I feel it so deep inside
It's something something I just can't hide
It's something I just cannot hide
Can I hide?
I see it in my dreams
It's not quite what it seems
Your touch was fading fast
This love ain't gonna last
This love ain't gonna last
I got a premonition
I got a premonition
I see it in my dreams baby
I got a premonition
It's not quite what it seems (I got a premonition)
This love ain't gonna last (Premonition)
I see it in my dreams, baby (Premonition)
I see it, I see it in my dreams
It's not quite what it seems
I got a premonition
I got a premonition
I got a premonition baby
I got a premonition about you
