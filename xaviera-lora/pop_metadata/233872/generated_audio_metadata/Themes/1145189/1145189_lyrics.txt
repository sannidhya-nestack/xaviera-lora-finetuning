Got a notebook and it's pages all written about
This girl I found
She's like nothing I've ever seen
If you see me writing in my notebook you know who I'm writing about
She's so profound
And way too good for me
She's got me mesmerized with the way she talks
That look in her eyes when she knows she rocks
God's perfect design, you really got it right
Don't know how to describe, one day I'll make her mine
One day I'll be making her mine
One day I'll make her mine
One day I'll be making her mine
Know you got a lot of shit on your plate but when you feel alone
I'll always be around
I'm just one call away
I'm sure you got a lot of guys who want you so I wrote you this song
So you might look at me
I wonder what you'll think
She's got me mesmerized
Scared to me every time
Her heart's so divine
I bask in the radius
My hand on her thigh
Can't get it off my mind
Might tell myself a lie
One day I'll make her mine
One day I'll be making her mine
One day I'll make her mine
One day I'll be making her mine
One day I'll make her mine
I don't know if I'll ever find the right words to say
She's the most eous thing that I can say I've ever seen
Brighter than the rising sun and luminescent like the moon
Universe just seems so dull when it's all compared to you
Almost wish I never met you everyone just feels so lame
Tried to get over you but other girls don't hit the same
Things she said and memories are proceeding around my brain
In a doubt is knowing I'll make her mine
One of these days
