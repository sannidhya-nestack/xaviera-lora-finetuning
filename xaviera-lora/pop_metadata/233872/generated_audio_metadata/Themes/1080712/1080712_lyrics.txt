I've been through it all there is nothing you can teach me
I'm telling my story I just want you to feel me
I've been a sinner oh oh oh oh
I think I've seen it all oh oh oh oh
I've been through it all there is nothing you can teach me
I'm telling my story I just want you to feel me
I think I've seen it all, I think I've seen it all
I've been through it all, I think I've seen it all
My mind's lost, where's my mind?
Damn, life's a controller
Hangover, what the fuck I've been drinking?
In my life everything is just missing
They say it gon' be fine, why my mind's lost?
Alex I'm done what the fuck am I thinking
They don't see my feelings that is why they think so
I've been through it all man I think I've seen it all
The only thing I feel is sad when truth is cold
Just feeling like taking no one's call
Music is what I've been called for
I didn't chose myself I was chosen for
DNA is thought I've just crossed your thought
Blessed with curses I think it's what I live for
I was chosen for
I think I live for
I been through it all
There is nothing you can teach me
I'm telling my story
I just want you to feel me
Man I've seen it all
I think I've seen it all
I've been through it all
There is nothing you can teach me
I'm telling my story
I just want you to feel me
I think I've seen it all, I think I've seen it all, I think i've seen it all, I think i've seen it all, I think i've seen it all
I see ghosts in my way
I see ghosts in my way
And I see the water killin' me
And I see the water killin' me
And I'm dying inside
And I'm dying inside my heart
I've been through it all there is nothing you can teach me
I'm telling my story I just want you to feel me
I've been a sinner oh oh oh oh
I think I've seen it all oh oh oh oh
I've been through it all there is nothing you can teach me
I'm telling my story I just want you to feel me
I think I've seen it all, I think I've seen it all, I think i've seen it all, I think I've seen it all, I think I've seen it all
