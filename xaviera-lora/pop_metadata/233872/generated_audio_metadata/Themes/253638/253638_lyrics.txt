Rock and roll, hip-hop with soul (check it out)
Now I'm rockin' out (ha-ha)
It's too late, no, you can't stop it now
Momentum moving the crowd
The critics are on the prowl, just judging my style
They can't figure it out and wanna know what I'm about
Where I'm from or what I've done
That's unnecessary, humdrum
No I ain't a dumb-dumb
Man I'm a smart ass
And like ladies with a large ass
Some say I'm too rude
But how's that
Cause I don't do interviews
I'm true to my roots
Motivating the youth
By working hard in the booth
I'm enjoying my life making music my wife
Let's swing to add some spice
Pick any style that you like and we can do it
Approach them with the smoothest movement
I'm too cool but there's always room for improvement
Come on let's rock and roll hip hop with soul
I gotta go, I gotta go, can't stop now
Making music by the stockpiles
Check my file online right now
It's rock and roll, hip hop with soul
I gotta know, I gotta know, can we get down
Spread the word around town
I was lost but now I'm found
And if I rock too hard, that's too damn bad
I'm unique through the message I speak
On a beat, no this ain't the peak
This is where I begin
The source of a legacy, I'm at it again
With my pad and my pen
I explore
A journey to the core of music
And study just like a student
Far from prudent, I'm a visionary
My audio commentary is legendary
The wealth is secondary
Cause I'm already fortunate
Disobey the ordinance
Decorate my resume, turn accolades to ornaments
The truest hip hop ain't never corporate
So now I'm over it, cause these VIP's are blowing it
They had they chance to make a change
But fell victim to the flame, to the fortune and fame
They got nerve to complain, man I'm stranded in the rain
And struggle to maintain on my path against the grain
It's rock and roll, hip hop with soul
I gotta go, I gotta go, can't stop now
Making music by the stockpiles
Check my file online right now
It's rock and roll, hip hop with soul
I gotta know, I gotta know, can we get down
Spread the word around town, I was lost but now I'm found
I was saved by the rock and roll, hip hop and soul
My alter ego's out of control, I take charge to be ambitious
Mutate my mixes like a chemist, then bridge the gap
Just like a dentist, official consensus
Just labeled me a leader, a motivated speaker
Turning doubters to believers, takers to levers
Rising up, digging deeper, baby I'ma keep going
But that's besides the point'cause it's a different type of joint
Inspired by the music, original score
I got the copyrights to prove it, fuel for movement
It's all that I release, some say they want it all
But I'm just trying to get a piece of mind
Design the styles, make'em one of a kind
Find mountains to climb to conquer my fear
Voicing an opinion that nobody wants to hear
Now it's clear, shit I haven't felt this way in years
It's rock and roll, hip hop with soul
I gotta go, I gotta go, can't stop now
Making music by the stockpiles

It's rock and roll, hip hop with soul
I gotta know, I gotta know, can we get down
Spread the word around town
I was lost but now I'm found
Rock and roll, hip hop soul
Rock and roll, hip hop soul
