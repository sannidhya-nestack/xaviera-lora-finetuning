I can see you, I can see you
I can see you living carefree, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can see you living carefree on the weekends
You hanging out with all your new friends
You trying drowning out with champagne
You ain't gon change and that's for anyone
I can see you living carefree on the weekend
You hanging out with all your new friends
You trying to drown it out with champagne
You ain't gon change and that's for anyone
Like why you been up late
Like why you been upset
Like why are you angry
Have you had enough yet
I said I'm way too young
Hey, yah, let's go
Like what's your angle
Girl if you say so
I keep it way low
Said I'll keep it way low
From the day one
You've been my A1
Said you ride for me
I never had to say none
But you put me right back in the situation
After I just opened up to you
I never meant to cause you any pain
Open I can't make it up to you
And now I'm caught up, I don't know what happened
All that talk was cheap and you spent my cash left off like a bandit
Hell yeah, had my heart in both hands
I wasn't ready for the change of plans
Yeah, or the change of heart
Hopeless romantic getting torn apart like
I said I'm way too young
To get caught up in a fantasy
I said I'm way too young
To get caught up in you and me
