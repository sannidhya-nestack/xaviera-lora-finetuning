On this day a star was born, a soul so bright
A heart adorned with faith in love
With every tear I've grown through every passing year
Happy birthday dear friend of mine
In your light
We all shine, may your wishes stay flying
And so this day and forevermore
Wish they'd scaffold up
Boy panels dancing in the breeze
Beaching on photos with memories
With every step you paint your tale
A masterpiece beyond the veil
Happy birthday dear friend of mine
In your light
We all shine, may your wishes take flight
And so this day and forevermore
This day and forevermore
