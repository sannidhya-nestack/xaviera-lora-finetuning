In the summer I hear
Laughter through the breeze
Oh my mind is at ease
Follow me down while the waters lay low
Or just go wandering through time
But you can't stay long
Or this great divide
It will swallow us alive
Follow the signs
I'll be there
Waiting all my life
I glimpsed your fleeing eyes
So bright
Cast upon the fading light
I would take the lead
Take you by the hand
And go out walking upon the land
Would you even care if you knew?
I would always love you
