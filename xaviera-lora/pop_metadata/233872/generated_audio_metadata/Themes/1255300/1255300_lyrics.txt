When kickoff came you'd be by the fence
To watch me try as best as I could
Taught me in the backyard taken by the legs
Never give up give a hundred percent
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Went to see brothers each week end
Granted you and I, cushions on the bench
Smoke and Joe Killroy got us to our feet
For a moment we could believe
The bigger they are the harder they fall
The bigger they are the harder they fall
The bigger they are the harder they fall
The bigger they are the harder they fall
Now the game's not the same
The money made it so
All we got is a memory
That can't be sold
No, we can't pretend
There's one more tackle, one more kick
I'll remember everything that you et
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
The bigger they are the harder they fall
The bigger they are the harder they fall
