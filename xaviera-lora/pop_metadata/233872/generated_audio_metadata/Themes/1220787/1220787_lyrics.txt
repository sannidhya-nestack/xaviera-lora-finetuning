This is insane, I better wanna get out
No one can hear no matter how I shout
Turn around to see if something is there
This ain't a movie but I am scared
Yeah, yeah
No one is listening
I'm a ghost trying to move the air
I wish this was a dream
I get work and I have to kill
I've got thousands of songs to sing
And a tree falls down with no one listening
If I sing a song and no one is there
Then I didn't sing it but I did, I swear
Yeah, yeah
No one is listening
I'm a ghost trying to move the air
I wish this was a dream
I could wake and not have to care
I'm trying to break out of here but I can't be heard
I can't scream loud enough, throw around the words
Like so many leaves, scattered on the wind
And now the winter's coming, yeah we know what that means
Yeah, yeah
No one is listening, I'm a ghost trying to move the air
I wish this was a dream
I can wake and not have to care
I'm not bitter, just resign
I can't say I haven't tried
All the effort, all the time
One more song, another rhyme
I'm not bitter, just resign
I can't say I haven't tried
All the effort, all the time
One more song, another rhyme
And the choice is always mine
No one is listening
I'm a ghost trying to move the air
I wish this was a dream
I could wake and not have to care
No one is listening
I'm a ghost trying to move the air
I wish this was a dream
I could wake and not have to care
