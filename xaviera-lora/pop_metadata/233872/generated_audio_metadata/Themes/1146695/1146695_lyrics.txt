When will we ever go away from here?
Can you not see it's rising in the air?
A pressure is building all around me
Can you not see it's rising up again
Oh, she's falling for you boy
I'm falling for you girl
It's pressure all around
Making you want to run
What do I do? How do I pay?
How do I make all hurts go away?
Where do I turn when I'm the one to burn
If I keep on acting this way?
She's falling for you, boy
I'm falling for you, girl
It's pressure all around
Making you want to run
E-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o
Run
Let me hear you say pressure, everybody say pressure, we come to give you that pressure, can you feel that pressure, try to not say pressure, lunatic say pressure, we come to give you that pressure, let me hear you say pressure
I'm falling, she's falling, after crawling, I'm crawling, after falling, I'm hoping after you
Let me hear you say pressure
Everybody say pressure
We come to give you that pressure
Can you feel that pressure
29 say pressure
Lunatic say pressure
We come to give you that pressure
Let me hear you say pressure
Everybody say pressure
