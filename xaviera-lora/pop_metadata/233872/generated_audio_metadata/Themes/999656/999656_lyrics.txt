You're a mistake that I keep on making
You only come back when the memories fade in
And it happens over and over
Over and over
Over and over again
You're a mistake that I keep on making
You're the high that I keep chasing
I'm wanting more every breath that I take in
And it happens over and over, over and over, over and over again
You're the high that I keep chasing, oh
Yeah, the last time only left me hurting
But I know that it'd be worth it if I could just have you tonight
You might wreck my plans if I let you
I'll be willing to regret you for the rest of my life
As long as I have a heart worth breaking
You're a mistake that I keep on making
You're the reason I'm not sleepin'
there's nothin' louder than one heart beatin'
And it echoes over and over, over and over, over and over, over and over
The last time only left me hurting
But I know that it'd be worth it if I could just have you tonight
You might wreck my plans if I let you
But I'd be willing to regret you
For the rest of my life
As long as I have a heart worth breaking
Your mistake that I'll keep on making
Oh, I'll keep on making
Keep on, keep on making, oh
I keep on, keep on loving you, loving you
