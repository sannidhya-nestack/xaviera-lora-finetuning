Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-nana
Maybe it's for the best
Y'all went out of style
You didn't see it coming
But I've known it for a while
She threw you away, looking to upgrade
She didn't think you had it but I don't feel the same
I could be your porch light on this dark night
Then you'll see that this ain't gonna be the same love twice
If you never look then you'll never know what's on the other side of a heart that's broke
If you came to me I'd help you find that feeling
If you never try I'll never show what you could have
If you let it go I'll be, I'll be everything you didn't know you needed
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-Na-na-na
I'll be
I wanna make my move but I don't wanna be your second best
She burned your heart down and it ain't done spoken yet
Time will heal the pain, it'll be okay
I know it's hard to see the bigger picture when you got
Tunnel vision but I hope you'll see
The light at the end of it has always been me
If you never look then you'll never know what's on the other side of a heart that's broke
If you came to me I'd help you find that feeling
If you never try I'll never show what you could have
If you let it go I'll be, I'll be everything you didn't know you needed
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-nana
I'll be
The hardest part is waiting
Patience is overrated
When you're gonna say that I'm the one you need
If you never look then you'll never know
What's on the other side of a heart that's broke
If you never look, then you'll never know
What's on the other side of a heart that's broke
If you came to me, I'd help you find that feeling
If you never try, I'll never show what you could have
If you let it go, I'll be, I'll be
Everything you didn't know you needed
Everything you didn't know you needed
Everything you didn't know you needed
