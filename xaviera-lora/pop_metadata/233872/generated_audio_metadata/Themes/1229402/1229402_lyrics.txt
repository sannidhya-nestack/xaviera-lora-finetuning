Has the world gone wild?
Does it seem a little colder?
I've gone a thousand miles
And I feel a little older, so much wiser
I have burned and I have tried
I made my way through the dark like candles
Sometimes I've cried
But I'm stronger now
A little stronger now
And if we still have a heart
I will love a little harder
When it all falls apart
Just dig a little deeper
Move a little closer
Because I've yearned to be free
From the chains that have bound me
I've been tangled
And now I believe
That I am stronger now
A little stronger now
Because I burn
I've been tangled, like a candle
Oh, I have burned and I have tried
I've made my way through the dark like candles
Sometimes I've cried but I am stronger now
Stronger now
Oh, I've been tangled
Lighting candles, I've been tangled, I've been tangled, Lighting candles
