I don't care, I don't care
Uh, gratitude is in season, ain't gotta look for a reason
I got the joy inside that ain't leavin', as long as I keep breathin'
Uh, this the time to bring folks together, family ties are as close as ever
Dinner time, toast to the chef, sweet potato pies on golden ember
It's so delicious, I hope your wishes come to fruition for you this Christmas
I know you live for the joy of giving together, this is what we believe in
So give the gift of love this year, don't back the room from my home back's here
Trees are flyin', light up the block and stuff your stocking with Christmas cheer
It's that time of year (Merry Christmas)
Time for joy and cheer (Merry Christmas)
Spread love in here (Cheer)
Pull up a chair, sit back, relax, Christmas is here (Merry Christmas)
It's that time of year (Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas)
Time for joy and cheer (Merry Christmas to you)
Spread love in here, pull up a chair, sit back, relax, Christmas is here
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas to you
