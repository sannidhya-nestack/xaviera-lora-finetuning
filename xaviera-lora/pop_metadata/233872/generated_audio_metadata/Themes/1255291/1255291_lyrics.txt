Got my heart on the man
Going drinking again
You're sitting at the bar with the Ray-Bans on
You know I can only pretend
That you didn't break my heart
Oh honey, stop me up
Just shake those hips and keep the truth from your lips
You know it's just a country song
you never loved me then
And sure as hell it won't be now
We're fading out like a Neil Young song
The embers of fire is gone
All the embers of fire is gone
Don't stop me thinking out loud
Honey, it's all I got now
Just give me a chance and I'll be mouthin' off a little
Just my bar off
And now you got the crowd
Eatin' out of your hands
You pull those moves just to catch my breath
Why don't you keep your shit to yourself
you never loved me then
And sure as hell it won't be now
We're fading out like a Neil Young song
The embers of fire's gone
Oh the embers of fire's gone
'Cause you never loved me then
And sure as hell it won't be now
We're fading out like a Neil Young song
The embers of fire's gone
All the embers of fire's gone
All the embers of fire's
