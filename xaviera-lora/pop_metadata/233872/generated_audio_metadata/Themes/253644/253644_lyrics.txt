Welcome to the North Coast
Welcome to the North Coast and the revolution
Haters got problems man I got solutions
Cruising down the Golden Gate with three babes on a double date
Cause I was born to create to make the people love me for who I am
Cause it's the all time great white rap middleweight
Yeah I'm moving up so mark it on your calendar
And tell the champ, Rick Adams is the challenger
Sharp as Excalibur, hustling flow
Way above your caliber, homie, you didn't know
I let the truth unfold, never lose control
Got a effortless approach and I ain't easy to coach
So lean back, raise your glass
Nah baby, don't stop shaking your ass
We lost at last
Currency ain't cash, I gotta get it made
I'm from the bank, representing when I do the damn thing
Cause rhyme is what we do
Sliding, we coming through
Climbing, the view is cool
I lie when I got the truth
Rhyme is what we do
Sliding, we coming through
Climbing, the view is cool
I lie when I got the truth
Charismatic with the rhyme
Now it's time to shine
Never been rusty plus this is all grind
Take one day at a time
Cool off, re-energize
Step back, relax and take a deep breath
Nothing worth the feeling of half full of stress
The more I feel the pressure the more I second guess
Only dumb things not shit I invest
God bless the dead and for all those left
It don't mean much but at least it's sad
How would you feel tangled up in a web of lies in the sea
Don't let it repeat life's hard as it is not made for the weak
Come test me kid if you wanna see some
Ain't no gang banging drop eyes with a gun
This is real music if you wanna see some
Hot spicy KJ with a kick of cumin
Rhyme is what we do
Sliding, we coming through
Climbing, the view is cool
I lie when I got the truth
Ooooo, rhyme is what we do
Sliding, we coming through
Climbing, the view is cool
I lie when I got the truth
Ayo, the flows that I spit are truly untraditional
They like medicinal or super physical
Too saucy my marinade
Atomic renegade incinerate the serenade
Flames dripping off the page
Burnin' safe, just playin' my forte
Don't sweat the technique'til I crash in soiree
Man I'm rockin' out
Demolishin' all doubts with a Vanguard sound
Standin' on higher ground
Rolling stone, physically bad to the bone
It's a long way home, I call it the Thunderdome
Or the Hotel California Westside
Prime time donin' on ya, let's ride
From sunset to sunrise
Open dangerous minds
With my rhymes, the potential is realized
Leaving folks baptized in a bay
I'm here to stay, okay, okay
Rhyme is what we do
Sliding, we coming through
Climbing, the view is cool
I lie when I got the truth
Rhyme is what we do
Sliding, we coming through
Climbing, the view is cool
I lie when I got the truth
I lie when I got the truth
I lie when I got the truth
I lie when I got the truth
I lie when I got the truth
