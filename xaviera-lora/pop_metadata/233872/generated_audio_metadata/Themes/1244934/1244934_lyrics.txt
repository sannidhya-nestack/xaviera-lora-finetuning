Read the scripture, seen the picture, start spitting the literature
Wasn't familiar, couldn't tell you from who or where I heard
As it occurs, actually I love it, I don't get perturbed
I just stay up in my space, good grace, treasure
Receiving it daily it only gets better
That's what I capture, every time is a pleasure
How much further will I go? No need to measure
I don't think I'll ever really die, never
Truly beautiful
It's so magical
Bold, hits me where I need to go
Truly beautiful, it's so magical
Bold, hits me where I need to go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I read the scripture, see the picture, start spitting the literature
Wasn't familiar, couldn't tell you from who or what I heard
As it occurs, actually I love it, I don't get perturbed
I just stay up in my space, good grace, treasure
Receiving it daily it only gets better
That's what I capture, every time is a pleasure
How much further will I go? No need to measure
I don't think I'll ever really die, never
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh (Oh) Oh (Oh) Oh (Oh) Oh (Oh) Oh (Oh) Oh (Oh)
I'm still here, I'm still here
