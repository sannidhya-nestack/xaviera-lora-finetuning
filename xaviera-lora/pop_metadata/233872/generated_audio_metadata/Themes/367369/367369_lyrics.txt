Have a happy new year
May the skies be now clear
With friends of good cheer
Fine wine and cold beer
Have a happy new year
Great music to hear
A love true and dear
With nothing to fear
Have a happy new year
Smooth course, not a steer
Where wonders appear
Best times always near
Nostalgia we feel for the old years and
Who we once were and where we once went
That time now spent, things said and meant
When we stood tall and when we bent
All that went right, some that went wrong
When we were weak and when we were strong
Days flow so fast, our lives barely cast
For those who have passed, just memories now last
So let's look ahead to new times instead
A new year to form, now waits to be born
Spring, summer, fall, winter now calls
Our newborn needs love to strive, come alive
So have a happy new year
May the skies be now clear
With friends of good cheer
Fine wine and cold beer
Have a happy new year
Great music to hear
A love true and dear
With nothing to fear
Have a happy new year
Great course not a steer
Where wonders appear
Best times always near
Have a happy new year
