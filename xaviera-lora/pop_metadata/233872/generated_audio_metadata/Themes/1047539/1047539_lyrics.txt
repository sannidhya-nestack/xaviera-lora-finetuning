It's a mystery
Far away the heavens glow
I wonder but I never know
We ride around in circles
Disbelief
Steadily the worry grows
You tell me but refuse to show
Enter in the morning cold
I will try forever
Who's sorry now?
Who's running now?
Who'll stay when it comes breaking down
I'll search the grounds till I find that
The flame extinguishing
Mystery bottoms of the burning rose
Avalanche into the froze
Hearing the warning so slow
Mystery
Remaining to the quiet room
Something has to happen soon
Haunted by the empty truth
We can't deny together
Oh sorry man
Who's running and who's staying when it comes breaking time
I'll search the grounds
I find a
Full-flaming
Sea which is the
Mystery
