World was on fire and no one could save me but you
Strange what desire will make foolish people do
No I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you, no
No, I, I, I, I don't wanna fall in love, no
I said, I, I, I, I don't wanna fall in love
This world will break your heart
Nobody's falling in love
Oh yeah, nobody, nobody
What a wicked game to play
To make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do
To let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say
You never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do
To let me dream of you
I, I, I, I don't wanna fall in love, no
I said I, I, I, I don't wanna fall in love
This world will break your heart
No, I, I, I, I don't wanna fall in love, love
I said, I, I, I, I don't wanna fall in love
This world will break your heart, nobody's falling in love
World was on fire and no one could save me but you
Strange what desire will make foolish people do
No I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
And I never dreamed that I'd know somebody like you, no, no
I, I, I, I don't wanna fall in love, no
I said I, I, I, I don't wanna fall in love
This will break your heart
No, I, I, I, I don't wanna fall in love
No, I said I, I, I, I don't wanna fall in love
This world will break your heart
Nobody's falling in love
