Now I try to get better
Every day I really try to believe
We will be free
Ain't no longer just a pleasure
Survival is becoming our defeat
Now it seems just like I'm out of place
It's not my way
Everyone is looking out for me
For me
Get away
Get away from the light
Get away from the bond of our life
Away from the madness of this golden cage
Get away and never come back home
It seems I'm going to live
It seems like I'm giving up on my dreams
Will I be free?
You can judge the way I'm feeling
I just wanna stay alive and be clean
I can throw a bottle in the sea
No one will see
Now I need to scrape all by myself
For real
Get away
Get away from the light
Get away from the thoughts of our life
Away from the madness of this chosen cage
Get away and never come back home
Get away, get away from the light
Get away from the vaunt of my life
Away from the madness of this golden gate
Get away and never come back
Get away, get away from the light
Get away, in the shadow of the night
I wasted more time than I should have
Get away, will I ever make another turn back
