Yes, I know how it's gonna be
Yes, I know just what's in store for me
Don't tell me twice, you don't have to say
Leave me alone, let me enjoy the pain
Wish I had the way, the way to make her see
What she's got and what she does for me
It's never enough
Na-na-na-na-na never enough
It's always the same
And here we go again
Yes, I know,'cause it's plain to see
This girl I know ain't ever looking at me
But she's the one who keeps me up at night
She's the one who till the morning light
Wish I had the way, the way to make her see
What she's got and what she does for me is never enough
Na-na-na-na-na never enough
It's always the same
And here we go again
It's never enough
No, no, no, no, no, never enough
It's always the same
And here we go again
A rise hypnotized
A passion you can't tame
I'm addicted to it now
That sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet pain
Never enough, nah nah nah nah nah never enough
It's always the same
Now there we go again
It's never enough
Nah nah nah nah nah never enough
It's always the same
Now there we go again
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh
A-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!
A-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!
A-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!
A-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!
A-woo-woo-woo-woo!
A-woo-woo-woo!
A-woo-woo-woo!
A-woo-woo!
