Sunrise in the city, but the ocean meets the sky ahead
She's walking down Collins with a sparkle in her eye
Beyond lights and palm trees, feeling so alive
South Beach beauty, yeah, she's ready for the night
She's a South Beach beauty dancing in the sun
Glamour in the air, pop the world in her hair
Underneath the stars where the night light shines
Living like a queen, she will never change her mind
Golden skin shades on, the vibe is so surreal
Every step she takes, it's like a movie reel
From Ocean Drive to the hottest clubs in town
She's the one they're watching, can't nobody bring her down
She's a South Beach beauty, dancing in the sand
She's a South Beach beauty, dancing in the sand
Glamour in the air, got the world in her hair
Underneath the stars, where the night light shines
Living like a queen, she will never change her mind
From Ocean Drive to the hottest clubs in town
She's the one they're watching
Can't nobody bring her down
She's a South Beach beauty, dancing in the sand
She's a South Beach beauty, dancing in the sand
Lantern in the air, got the world in her hand
Underneath the stars, where the night light shines
Living like a queen, she will never change her mind
Sunrise in the city, where the ocean meets the sky
She's walking down Collins with a sparkle in her eye
Neon lights and palm trees, feeling so alive, South Beach beauty
Yeah, she's ready for the night
The rhythms in her soul, she's shining like the sun
In this city of dreams she flies towards the sun
She's a South Beach beauty dancing in the sand
Glamour in the air got the world in her hand
Underneath the stars where the night lights shine
Living like a queen she will never change her mind
She's a South Beach beauty living in the glow
Where the party never ends and the good times flow
