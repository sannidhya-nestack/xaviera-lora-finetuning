We've been put down
We've been hiding
We ran the risk involving trying
All these feelings
Seems so wasted
When your ID seems to look debated
Now we go along
On the highway of the unknown future
Don't give up
We should rest in peace when everything is traced to the ground
After the earthquake
After the clash of elements
Now we get stronger
Now we can finally stand
After the flooding
There would be no more firewood
But we got stronger
And we are making brighter
All the seasons
We'll come to the end
But this one seems like it's gonna last
Now we go alone
On the highway of the unknown future
Don't give up
We should rest in peace when everything is raised to the ground
After the earthquake
After the clash of elements
Now we get stronger
Now we can finally stand
After the flooding
There would be no more Byron Wood
But we got stronger
And we are making brighter hood
The palace burns and crashes down tonight
They even killed the joy of being right
God look at me, I am the last man alive
When there's no man's we will rise
After the earthquake
After the clash of elements
Now we get stronger
Now we can finally stand
After the bloody
There will be no more firewood
But we get stronger
And we are making brighter
And we can finally stand
And we are making right at home
