When there's trouble, you're not alone
It's okay to fall sometimes
Confusing and enduring
Signs are coming up
And if you want you could stay here
Until the clouds are out are out
Come on, drop the phone, boss
There's no way we're gonna give up
Remember me for what?
We tried to have that night
Father, just ive me
For I have sinned and I
Dropped the phone in my sleep
There's no way we're gonna give up
Remember me for what?
When trying to have that night
Oh, drop the phone, boss
There's no way we're gonna give up
Remember me for what?
We tried to have that night
