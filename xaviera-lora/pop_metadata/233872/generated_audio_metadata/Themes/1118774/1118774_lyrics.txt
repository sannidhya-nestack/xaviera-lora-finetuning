Ooh
Ooh
Baby can you feel the space collapse
All around our bodies and perhaps
That's the reason
I'm so dizzy
Get out of my head, get out of my head
Give me back my breath
Get out of my head, get out of my head
You give me
Where'd you go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Where'd you go, no, oh, no, no, oh, oh, oh, oh
Better go, better go, better go, better go, better go
Butter, butter cold, oh
Baby can you feel the space collapse
All around our bodies and perhaps
That's the reason
I'm so dizzy
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
Give me back my breath
Get out of my head, get out of my head, ive me
Where'd he go, oh, oh, oh
Where'd you go, no, oh, no, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh, where'd it go?
Where'd it go?
Where'd it go?
Oh, oh, oh, where'd you go?
No, oh, no, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, better go
Better, better go, hello
