Oh Mary, this London's a wonderful sight
Where the people are working by day and by night
They don't sow potatoes, nor barley, nor wheat
But there's gangs of them digging for gold in the streets
At least when I asked them that's what I was told
So I soon took a hand in this digging for gold
But for all that I found there I might as well be
Where the mountains of mourn sweep down to the sea
You remember young Peter, old Lachlan of course
Well he's over here now at the head of the force
I saw him today as I walked down the Strand
And he stopped all the traffic with one wave of his hand
And there we stood talking of days that were gone
While a whole population of London looked on
But for all his fine powers, he's wishing like me
To be back where the dark morn sweep down to the sea
There's beautiful girls here now, never you mind
Beautiful shapes nature never designed
Lovely complexions of peaches and cream
And lips like a rose in the soft summer rain
But if at those roses you venture to sip
The colour will all come away on your lips
So I'll wait for the wild rose that's waiting for me
In the place where the dark morn's weeped unto the sea
