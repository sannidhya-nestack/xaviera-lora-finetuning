The band is swinging, the lights are low
The room's alive with a golden glow
The clock is ticking, it's almost time
For a New Year's kiss that's simply sublime
Raise your glass, let the bubbles fly
Here's to the stars in the midnight sky with a cling
And a cheer, love takes its cue
On New Year's Eve it's just me and you
The dance floor's calling, let's take a chance
With a spin and a dip in a sweet romance
Your laughter sparkles like champagne's fizz
Tonight's the start of all that is
The countdown's near, the magic grows
A moment to freeze where love overflows
The band crescendos, the crowd draws near
A kiss to seal another year
Raise your glass, let the bubbles fly
Here's to the stars in the midnight sky with a clink
And a cheer, love takes its cue
On New Year's Eve it's just me and you
Confetti falls like a shimmering rain
Washing away the years old refrain
Hand in hand let's step through the door
Together we'll dance forevermore
Confetti falls like a shimmering rain
Washing away the years old refrain
Hand in hand let's step through the door
Together we'll dance forevermore
