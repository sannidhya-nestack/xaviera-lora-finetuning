It only happens once a year
St. Paddy's Day is finally here
So raise your glass of shamrock cheer
We love green beer
The Emerald Isle is in our blood
Everyone's Irish in this pub
It's not just the colour that we wear
We love green beer
What goes in must come out
And when it does there is no doubt
It's not amber, gold or honey
Bay Street
You're in the money
Toast to a stranger
Toast to a friend
May leprechauns dance over your bed
Shout it loud for all to hear
We love green beer
What goes in must come out
And when it does there is no doubt
It's not amber, gold or honey
(Bet it's green)
You're in the money
(Hey!)
Toast to a stranger
Toast to a friend
May leprechauns dance over your bed
Shout it loud for all to hear
We love green beer
It's not just the colour that we wear
We love green beer
So raise your glass of shamrock cheer
We love green beer
