Before the morning sun
Lights up this sleepy town
You slip out of bed and pack up some clothes
And take your final look around
You get to my shoulder
Hesitate when you see your name
Surrounded by a heart
But you won't get away
Just leave me here and go
But you know there's a round trip ticket tucked in your coat
You feel something coming on from every side
No matter where you hide you're surrounded by the heart
Running into an emptiness and all inside you hear is your footsteps and they're pounding in your head
Face to face with your peers but don't worry
No don't worry dear
Cause I got your back
Just like I always have
But the train's almost ready to take you away
To that golden shore
But you're looking over your shoulder
As you climb aboard one small stand
The other way
And you know you can't stay
Surrounded by the heart
Ooh
You've always been surrounded by that heart, ooh
