There are sometimes in life when you lose your way
But you're always there to guide me to find my place
Some days I feel like dying
I'm not afraid
But every once in a while I'm crying
Down on my knees I pray
For love to save me and bring me back to life
For trust when faith seems to be running dry
Bring me back to life
Why do we fill our minds with things that are empty
When we should be free of sin and not contained by greed
For years the world's been spinning out of control
It's time we take the wheel and stop doing what we're told
For love to save us and bring us back to life
For trust when fate seems to be running dry
For love to save us and bring us back to life
For trust when fate seems to be running dry
For love
To save me and bring me back to life
For trust when fate seems to be running dry
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
