Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And I can tell you I've been feeling it
All my life has been nothing but an experiment
Deepest I never thought I could feel a sentiment
Till I met you honey you sweeter than cinnamon
I got a sweet tooth honey you my regiment
Daily I need you more than medicine
You turn a thug into nothing but a gentleman
Now I know what a man
Honey you haven't said for me
And all I really, really wanna see is you before me
Girl, I need somebody like you who adores me
A hottie with a body like you that draws me, calls me
I found love and I don't really know what to do with it
I found love and I don't really know how to roll with it
I found love
Really don't know how to feel about it
Help me find a way how to deal about it
But I found love
The birth of the first love, the worst love
Usually thought about as the cursed love
I thought that first time wasn't hurt-o
And I thought that was the only version
But I know I had to have you'cause something'bout you different, girl
Yeah, you really carry value
Passin' through with them baddie moves
Make me a happy dude, ain't nobody mad at you
Sweetie
Feeding needy, heart of mine, yeah I'm greedy
Need you more than riches, need you more than many bitches
We fitting like a glove, hope your loving never switches
Swear to god I really never knew what this is
All I know is something missing when you're missing
Don't know what love is, it ain't got a description
It used to be so different, used to hit the wall and fall
We was going nowhere
Try to walk but we crawl
Yeah you made it easy
With the love we have for each other we traded freely
When I look into your dreamy eyes you still intrigue me
Really girl you are the only one that needs me
I found love and I don't really know what to do with it
I found love and I don't really know how to roll with it
I found love, really don't know how to feel about it
Help me find a way how to deal about it
But I found love
I found love and I don't really know what to do with it
I found love and I don't really know how
Love, really don't know how to feel about it
Help me find a way how to deal about it, but I found love
