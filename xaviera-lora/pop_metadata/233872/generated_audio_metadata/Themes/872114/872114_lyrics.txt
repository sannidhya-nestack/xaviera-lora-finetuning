Late bloomer
I watch you shining more everyday
And I knew you got to be the one
Late bloomer
You always had your own special way
And I knew you got to be the one
When I came to the island you were so shy hiding with the wild cats
I figured I'd be here you'd be over there to each their own and that be that
But everyday I look there be something'bout you I didn't notice before
One day you took my hand and showed me around now we ain't strangers anymore
You do it your way bloomer
I watch you shining more everyday
And I knew you got to be the one
Woah, late bloomer
You always had your own special way
And I knew you got to be the one
Never too early, never too late, just totally free
Never no pressure for perfection, all we can just be
And we can just sit and wait for the stars to come out
No timeline in our mind
We're glowing hard around the edges and we're always getting there
To make the waves while the moon shines
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yo, yo, yo
Lake Bloomer
I watch you shining more everyday
And I knew you got to be the one
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Lake Bloomer
You always had your own special way
And I knew you got to be the one
Yo, yo, yo
Lake Bloomer
I watch you shining more everyday
And I knew you got to be the one
Way bloomer
You always had your own special way
And I knew you got to be the one
