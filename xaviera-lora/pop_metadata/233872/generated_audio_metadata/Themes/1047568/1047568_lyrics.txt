And bright the morning has begun
The arrows, the arrows, the arrows fire
Still I get shaking when they come
The adult, the adult, the adult mind
Still I have word of what they've done
We're out of, we're out of, we're out of time
When not an hour can be one
We got to, we got to remind
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm dreamin', ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
No one's there, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I make this everything, everything, everything
Breathe in the locked and key we are
Much closer that we've been apart
Look down, we've made it pretty far
This matter, this matter, this matter shines
Off with the scene of me so hard
We're out of, we're out of time
But even
All the years (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Can't waste it (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Everything, everything, every
To write this line right here
To write this line right here
To write this line right here
Line right here
To write this line right here
To write this line right here
To write this line right here, line right here, ah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm bleeding all the years
And tasting where I'm held, where I'm held
Where I'm held, where I'm held
Can you tell?
