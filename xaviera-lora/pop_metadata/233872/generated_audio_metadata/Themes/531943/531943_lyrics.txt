Should auld acquaintance be ot and never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be ot and auld lang syne?
My dear, fallen sun
We'll take a cup of kindness yet falling sign
We two have run about the slopes and picked the Daisy's vine
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
Falling sun, falling sun
My dear, falling sun
We'll take a cup of kindness yet falling sign
Should old acquaintance be ot
And never brought to mind
Should old acquaintance be ot and all inside
Fall inside, my dear, fall inside
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
