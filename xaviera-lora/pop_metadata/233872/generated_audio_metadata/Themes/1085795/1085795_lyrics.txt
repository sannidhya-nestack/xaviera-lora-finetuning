From time to time it comes around, tears hit the ground
And everybody wants to be strong, pound for pound
And every once in a while, you're on bended knee
Watching the sweat rain down from your grill
In slow motion effect, your blood conquers your will
Your eyes close and everything is suddenly so real
That's when you stop and realize the whole thing's a mess
You couldn't clean it up if you burned the whole damn address
But still we press
Forward and we don't regress, thinking that by making it clean we can make it fresh
I remember letting my head rest, bleeding to death
And wondering if I would ever catch my breath
And in that test, becoming clear about life's best
And even if I messed it all up, I was still blessed
It's like a candle burning in the wild west, dripping all over your desk
Randomly wax builds upon duress
When the time comes to say me say
I've been waiting all my life for this
I just pray that I carry through
You don't always have to be the best
You just do what you have to do
But life's a freakin' circle, ain't it funny how it comes around
Thought you got away, but you were really just a bloodhound
Homebound, looking for your voice to resound
But the peace of you, you punks was never really underground
Yo, you call yourself a square, but you're as round as any ball
Lay down on a straight line, you'll do nothing but fall
Footsteps are on the path already that you claim you're blazin'
You'll be back to meet yourself and everything amazing
You're like a dog chasing its tail if you be human
You can't deny the Gemini duality consuming
Everything you do and everywhere you go
Back and forth like a yo-yo and everything you know
Yo, the only way to keep yourself from spinning like a dreidel
Is latch yourself to Mobius and let it make you able
Yo, you won't get away from it, the steel is gonna squeal
But at least the truth will be there when you reinvent the wheel, come on
I've been waiting all my life for this
I just pray that I carry through
You don't always have to be the best
You just do what you have to do
So I begin to befriend all the things I've been
And I'm seeing in the end it's an upward trend
But you wouldn't believe the trouble that I've seen since then
And I grab and I clutch and I break this pen
And I don't even remember all the men I've been
From the top to the end I go back again
And when I've slammed on the floor I'll get up once more
And it won't mean a thing if I don't come forth
And I walk to the end of this blackout raid
And I sweat and I fret
And I bend this cage
And I scratch in the dirt
And I make things bleed
And I draw from the hurt
All the strength I need
And I know that to grow
I'ma hurt like whoa
But I can never ever ever let it stop this flow
I've been waiting all my life for this
I just pray that I carry through
You don't always have to be the best
You just do what you have to do
