I was whiskey on the wild side
Till I heard your sweet and sober voice
Every weekend was uptown crazy
Till you turned down all the noise
Now it's peaceful easy Sunday afternoons
And I'm the open book that's laying next to you
You know the way to flip my page
So we get to the good parts faster
Sunny smile on your face
Turns my lonely days into laughter
Split the story of my life into two chapters
Everything before you and the beautiful ever after
I used to hate it when it rained'til
It meant I'd get to spend the day inside with you
I used to turn off those silly love songs
I found out they're all true
they sing about the girl who hung the moon
And now I know that girl was always you
You know the way to flip my page
So we get to the good parts faster
Sunny smile on your face
Turns my lonely days into laughter
Split the story of my life into two chapters
Everything before you and the beautiful ever after
I ain't no Hemingway but girl I gotta say
You know the way to flip my page so we get to the good parts faster
Sunny smile on your face turns my lonely days into laughter
Split the story of my life into two chapters
Everything before you and the beautiful ever after
You're my beautiful ever after
