They're my murderer, yeah
They're my murderer
I will
They're my murderer, yeah
They're my murderer
Well, drops don't let them pass the blame
Me no know what it contain
Putting toxin in Rasta man vein
Lock me up and call me insane
They try to take us down
Every time them hear the real sounds
They try to take us down
Every time we come up from the deep ground
So lonely at the top top
I follow dot to dot dot
Feel I lost the plot plot
Life just cost a lot lot
Probably better shot shot
Clearly left to rot rot
Look for body clots clots
Hope to God it stops stop
Have a muzzle face face
We be state controlled
Be the human race race
We be pigeon hold
People lost their taste (gone) from a common scold
In fever, trapped with a common cold (well)
Am I murderer, yeah, am I murderer?
Oh, oh, well
Stand together seeking truth this is bravery
Getting cooked in the kitchen just flavoured me
When I said no the public never favoured me
Stand together seek proof this is slavery
Trust karma life could make it even
Much drama choice of being vegan
Bad farmer forbidden in your Eden
Lost their armour, people seeking freedom
Keep jumping, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
