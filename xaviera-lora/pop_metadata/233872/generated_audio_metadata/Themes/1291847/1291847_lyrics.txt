There's so much excitement in Raven's football
Energy grows, adrenaline pumps in early fall
Minds grow nervous, pulses reach high altitude
Drums are thumping, the fans are singing true
We've been knocked around a time or two ourselves
But we will raise the claw and we're still standing tall
Let's all sing this Birdville bop
Welcome the Birdville word
The year of the bird
We are the Baltimore Ravens
When we play defensive
There are no safe havens
When they play against
The Baltimore way
Opposing offenses
Won't et the day
We are the Baltimore Ravens
We're too classy for a bunch of trash talking
Super Bowl glory will tell our whole story
Welcome to Baltimore Birdville
A rock and roll bird that says this word
For Raven's Train
In the school of hard knocks let us sing
A bird that forever rocks a football team
Yeah! Hit forever, Fox! Rock the Raven evermore!
Our illustrious fans
Soldiers with inspirational thoughts
Captivate
With motivational talks every year
A lot to be thankful for
Not missing a play
We're savoring the moments
Clawing on to memories
And beating our opponents
We say let this be
The year of the bird
Preaching powerful Baltimore words
Forever blocking, endlessly rocking
We are the Baltimore Ravens
When we play defensive there are no safe havens
When they play against the Baltimore way
Opposing offenses won't et the day
We are the Baltimore Ravens
We're the inspiration to the NFL
Two decades long defense has been the real deal
All of the legends who inspired the game
Such as Lewis and Suggs and Reed
Now General Joe Flake only the offense indeed
We are the Baltimore Ravens
When we play defensive there are no safe havens
When they play against the Baltimore way
Opposing offenses won't et the day
We are the Baltimore Ravens
We are the Baltimore Ravens
When we play defensive there are no safe havens
When they play against the Baltimore way
Opposing offenses won't et the day
We are the Baltimore Ravens
