Yes, welcome here to the island, we a groovin'
Blessed be young Rasta, you know
Voice jammin' and livin' it real
Give it to me slide, booy
First time you shined in my world
I felt dizzy, I felt drunk, must've soaked up too much sun
Later on, you came back with aloe and sweet tea
And that's when I knew it had to be you
Ooh, this was gonna be fun
I tried to keep some self control
Even though I wanted to touch
Your heart and soul
what we got is better than gold
Is better than the internet
Without a doubt about it
It's hot, it's like ooh ooh
The special sauce, cookin' on the stove top
Everyday people try to find what we got
It's the straight goods, we're solid, give a shout out if you got it
We're like rock stars in the sky, shining bright with the northern lights
So let's shine, we got the straight good good good goods
You know I'm gonna stick with you like green on trees
We'll be like the bud to the blossom to the birds to the bees
Feeling pretty awesome in our swathers free
True sometimes the jungle gets rough
But that's not enough to give it all up
Now we rock steady like machete cutting through that scourge
Until you finally find the love that fits that's just how it is
No alternatives
you know there ain't nothing like this
It's better than the internet
Without a doubt about it
It's hot like ooh ooh
The special sauce
Cookin' on the stove top
Everyday people try to find what we got
It's the straight goods, we're solid
Give a shout out if you got it
We're like rock stars in the sky
Shining bright within all the lights
So let's shine (let's it be)
Got this feeling, island girl
Let's be loose, live and free ya
Rasta people
Come on y'all
But some of the bands on here can't roll
All them boys rocking at the deep bowl
And if you step money here can't save
Some of the kids are dancing, wait
It's the straight goods, we're solid, give a shout out if you got it
We're like rock stars in the sky, shining bright with the northern lights
So let's shine, yeah let's shine
We gotta stay good, good, good, good, good, good
