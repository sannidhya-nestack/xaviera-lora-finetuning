I've held you in my heart
I've loved you from the start
I can't help but have you, I need you, relax, I won't chase you again
I've held my tongue for so long that it hurts me to say it, my friend
I've held you in my dreams
Are they more than what they seem
Was it so long ago
When I felt the need
I'm losing my life to a world of gold
I'm fearing the love of whom I've dreamt the most
Oh, you'll never know it,'cause all is lost
Lost
How could you know if I'm not?
Calling out to you again
Where did you go my lovely one
Are you not who you pretend
You came and went
Like a ghost in a mirror
I tried to hold you
In vision
I'm lost in the willows
I'm stuck in the mire
I've held you in my arms
I'm losing my life to a world of ghosts
I'm fearing the love of whom I've dreamt the most
