I feel the light in the burning rain, in the dawn, in the lounge, it's really made in heaven (x4)
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I feel the light in the burning rain
In the dawn and around you
Only made in amber
I feel the light in the burning rain
In the dawn and around you
Only made in amber
I feel the light in the burning rain
In the dawn and around you
Only made in amber
I feel the light in the burning rain
In the dawn and around you
Only made in amber
I feel the light, light, light, light
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I feel the light in the burning rain
In the dawn and around you
And it may never
I feel the light in the burning rain
In the dawn and around you
And it may never
I feel the light in the burning rain
In the dawn and around you
And it may never
I feel the light
I feel the light in the burning rain, in the dawn, in the ranch, in LMA, Namba (x4)
