When the sun slipped underneath my door
I knew it was gonna be one of those days
So I kicked off the blankets and I stretched out my bones
And rolled out of bed with a smile on my face
Oh yeah
Well you were at the kitchen table concentrating pouring maple
When you looked up from your crossword
Said what do we do today
What's there to do today to do today to do
Well say hey
Hey, it's the best day ever
Yeah, yeah, say hey, hey, hey
We can do whatever and whatever is clever
And we can do, we can make it the best day ever
Got a fresh batch of time and who knows what we'll find on the other side of that door
Maybe a mountain to climb or some water to slide or just another chance to start over
Hey is that a bunch of rare stones on the side of the road well let's tiptoe past the alligators
So we can put'em in our pockets and bring'em back home then we can shine those stones
And our smooth operator later on is even greater than whatever came before
The past is past it will be no more
Tomorrow we may never know
So now's the time but now's the time we go
Hey hey it's the best day ever yeah yeah yeah
Hey hey
And we can do whatever, and whatever is clever
And we can do it, we can make it
Hey, hey, it's the best day ever, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
We can do whatever and whatever is clever
And we can do it, we can make it the best day ever
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Today is the best day ever
