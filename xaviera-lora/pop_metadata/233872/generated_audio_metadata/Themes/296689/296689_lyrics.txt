We are gathered here together on this lovely summer day
To celebrate your union and send you on your way
As you tie your dreams together with a simple band of gold
We wish you all the joy your hearts can hold
Your lives have been a journey
The stars have been your guide
They have led you to this special one
Who's standing by your side
As you sail along together
And your destinies unfold
We wish you all the joy your hearts can hold
There surely will be trials along the way
And no one will be spared their share of pain
But though there may be hard times
We take delight in sunshine
Only when we've come to know
The lonely sound of rain
And the one that you have chosen is generous and kind
Knows the wisdom of iveness and the healing power of time
May they comfort and protect you and give you shelter from the cold
And bring you all the joy your heart can hold
And those of us who love you, our thoughts are with you now
We offer you our blessing and bear witness to your vow
May your home be filled with harmony from the music in your soul
And we wish you all the joy your hearts can hold
We wish you all the joy your hearts can hold
