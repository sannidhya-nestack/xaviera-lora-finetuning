In these connected lines
Oh I can feel you pulling me up
In this electric night
We are lost in the rhythm of love
In the breath of the wake of the dark
I am lost in your arms like a blinding sunrise
We escape in the fate of the walls
As we fall into place till the morning's bright side
Polarity, polarity, polarity
Polarity
In these connected lines
Oh, I can feel you pulling me up
In this electric night
We are lost in the rhythm of love
In the breath of the wake of the dark
I am lost in your arms like a blinding sunrise
We escape in the fade of the walls
As we fall into place'til the morning's bright side
Polarity, polarity, polarity
Polarity
Polarity
