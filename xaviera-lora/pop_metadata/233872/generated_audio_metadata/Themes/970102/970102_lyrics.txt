Wanna slow it down
Just need a little more time
In the orange glow of the street lights
Wrapped up safe and sound
In your leather jacket and I like it
But my body's feeling so tense
I don't do this often
Proceed with caution
There's one thing you should know about my heart
No you can't bring it back
Once you've taken it home
Tried it out for a while
Realized you were looking for something more
No you can't doctor it up
Make it look like new
No it won't always work just the way that you want it to
Yeah you can have it if you want it
But there ain't no returns, there ain't no returns
Yeah you can have it if you want it
But there ain't no returns, there ain't no returns
There ain't no returns
I've been down the road (down the road)
The road of the otten and the broken hearted
So I just gotta know (gotta know)
Are you that kinda different
Kinda something, kinda feeling
I've been missing
So before I fall in
Got to know you're all in
And you mean it
I don't need a secondhand heart
No, you can bring it back
Once you've taken it home
Tried it out for a while
Realized you were looking for something more
And you can't doctor it up
Make it look like new
No it won't always work just the way that you want it to
Yeah you can have it
If you want it
But there ain't no returns
There ain't no returns
Yeah you can have it
If you want it
But there ain't no returns
There ain't no returns
There ain't no returns
There ain't no returns
There ain't no returns
There ain't no returns, there ain't no returns
No, no, no there ain't baby
There ain't no returns, there ain't no returns
No there ain't baby
There ain't no returns, there ain't no returns
No, no, no they ain't baby
