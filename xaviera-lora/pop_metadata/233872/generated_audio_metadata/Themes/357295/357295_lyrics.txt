Summer comes, the summer goes and I live above
Lives that are hurt and strong, thought of once
Tomorrow and the next day will hold my bed
My mind is turning the pages of words that might be consoling some hope
To bring to their lives once again
And I hear her say
Am I ready to lose him?
Hear his songs
Feel his bones
It's like rain on our gardens
In the noontime when the sun is high
Be ready someday she says the broadways
Says the broadways
On his chair my friend rests the sunlight and dance
Crossed his face and chest breathes shallow
And then her voice brings him back once again
And I hear her saying
I've already lost him
Hear his songs
Feel his love
Like rain
On her gardens in the noontide
When the sun is high
There at Sunday she sells the parkways
She sells the parkways
She sells the parkways
Like a ring on a goddess in the noontide
When the sun is high, I'll be ready someday
She says the park waits, says the park waits
I send the bomb away, yes
Oh rain, on our gardens, in the noon time
When the sun is high, rain
But there are some days she says the bomb waits
Says the bomb waits for us
In the room down here where the sun is out
But there are some days she says the bomb waits
Says the bomb waits
Always, oh, hard to live on and hear him to rest with God
