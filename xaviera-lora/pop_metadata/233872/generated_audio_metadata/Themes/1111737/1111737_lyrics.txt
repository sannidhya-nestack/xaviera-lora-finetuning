I'm going back, going back, going back to the place where
Love is stronger, yeah, stronger (I'm coming home)
Where everyone sees my face, they always say, they say, they say
It's so good to see ya, see ya (Welcome home)
Oh, it's been so long
Since I've been to the place where I come from, I come from
I'm going back, going back, going back to the place where
Love is stronger, yeah, stronger (I'm coming home)
Where everyone will see my face
They always say, they say, they say
It's so good to see ya, see ya (Welcome home)
I'm going back, going back, going back to the place where
Love is stronger, yeah, stronger (I'm coming home)
Where everyone who sees my face they always say, they say, they say
It's so good to see ya, see ya
I'm going back, going back, going back to the place where
Love is stronger, yeah, stronger (I'm coming home)
When everyone sees my face they always say, they say, they say
It's so good to see ya, see ya (Welcome home)
