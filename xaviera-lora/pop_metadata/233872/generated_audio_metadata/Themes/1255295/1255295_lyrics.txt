I live and hope there will be one more chance for me
To walk hand in hand with you down Montague Street
I fell for you, the Russia youth, no other love for me
You let me go, the river took me out to the reach
Jacarandas are out in bloom
One more time, one less for you
Jacarandas are out in bloom
One more time, I long for you
I keep looking back this regret just won't come to pass
You said this is it all there is you won't get another chance
We built a home a wall of glass looking to the south
Spring brought the storm but kamos don't shatter it all of us
Jacarandas are out in bloom
One more time one less for you
Jacarandas are out in bloom
One more time I long for you
Jacarandas are out in bloom
One more time, one less for you
Jacarandas are out in bloom
One more time, I long for you
Jacarandas are out in bloom
One more time, one last for you
Jacarandas are out in bloom
One more time, I long for you
