Beneath the starry sky tonight we join in dance and song
To celebrate this New Year's Eve with everyone we love
The bitter taste of last year's resolutions left undone
Soon washed away by the taste of champagne on our tongues
The snare drum's roll is like a thread on which our hopes and dreams are strung
Fresh adventures to commence with the New Year's morning sun
When midnight hits I'll share a kiss with my darling
Dearest one, enchanted by
The taste of champagne on our tongues
As the ball drops
We all count down
Ten, nine, eight, seven
Five, four, three, two, one
Our lips meet
And the new year has begun
However old, forever young
When we remember the taste of champagne on our tongues
