In the quiet of the night, a star shines bright
Guiding every heart to the promise of life
Joy and peace are rising, hear the angels sing
Every soul rejoices for the hope you bring
Glory, glory, glory to the King
Lift your voice and let the church bells ring
This is the light, the light of the season
Hallelujah, let us praise for a reason
Through the streets the snow falls soft and clear
But inside our hearts your love is near
Hands together let the spirit flow
In every heart let your mercy flow
Mercy grows
Glory, glory, glory to the King
Lift your voice, lift your voice
And let the church bells ring
This is the night, this is the night
The light of the season
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Let us praise for a reason
Oh, lift her high (to me, lift her high) to the tender, tender (and to the man's desire) to the joy inside (to the joy inside) let the spirit guide (let the spirit guide) oh, oh (the love of the Lord) let the spirit guide (the spirit guide)
Glory, glory, glory, glory to the King
Lift your voice, let the church bells ring
The light shines bright, the light shines brighter
Hallelujah, sing it loud, let it bring the cheer
Glory, glory to the King
Lift your voice, lift your voice
And let the church bells ring
The light shines bright
The light of Christ is ahead
Hallelujah, sing it loud
Let our faith bring the cheer
Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory to the King
Lift your voice, kids, all us boys
And let the church bells ring
For life is coming, the light of the Savior is ahead
Hallelujah, let us praise for a reason
