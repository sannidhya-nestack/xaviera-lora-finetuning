Yes, I feel so nice
Yes, I feel so right
I'm thinking every night
And you're the reason why
You
You give me love and my heart is in death with you, oh
You
You give me love and my heart is in death with you, oh
In death with you
In death with you
Yes, I feel so nice, yes, I feel so right
I'm thinking every night, and you're the reason why
You, you give me love and my heart is in death with you, oh
You give me love and my heart is in debt with you, oh-oh-oh
In debt with you, oh-oh-oh
In debt with you, oh-oh-oh
In depth with you
In depth with you
In depth with you
In depth with you
