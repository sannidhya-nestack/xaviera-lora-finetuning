He came to town late one night, he was a traveler from the sea
He came to tell his famous tales and left them all for free
He said, "How must I go to get myself back to Mexico?
How must I ride?"
These endless roads
He took a boat along the coast
Round the horn when he saw the ghosts
He knew of those who tried but failed
His heart left home when his soul set sail
He taught us how to read the lights
That glitter up above all through the night
He said they are the gift of sight
For those who travel the seas at night
He said, "How must I go?"
Get myself back to Mexico
How must I ride these endless roads?
He came on down the Rio Grande
On a river boat wide and the waters like sand
He had to drag her across the land
Up the river and down again
He came to town late one night
He was a traveler from the sea
He came to tell his famous tales and left them all for free
He said, "How must I go to get myself back to Mexico?
How must I ride these endless roads?"
