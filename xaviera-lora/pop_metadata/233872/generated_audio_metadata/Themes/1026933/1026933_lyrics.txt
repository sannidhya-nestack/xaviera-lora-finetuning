Release yourself
Free your inner visions
Let your spirit loose
Release yourself
Become one
With the music
Back in the days, we were all dancing to the same beat
Release yourself in the dance
Free your inner visions
Let your spirit loose
And become one
And become one with the music
Free your inner visions
Let your spirit loose
And become one in the dance
And become one with the music
Music for me was never just about which DJ played my song or which label was cool
It's always been much more than that
Music has touched generations, liberated cultures
Made people fall in love, made people cry
It's true emotion
Pain
