I used to think that I'd never find my true love
All of my dreams had just faded away
I was drifting on my own
Like a ship out on a stormy sea
With no place to call home
Just like a song you came along that sunny day
You captured my heart like no other man
And the greatest gift of all
Is what I know so deep within my soul
It was part of a perfect plan
Look inside my heart and feel the love it holds for you
Look into these eyes, you'll see it shining through
If you ever have a doubt, when I say we'll never part
All you gotta do is take a look inside my heart
When we're alone, you come to me and ask me
How can I know that my love is real
No words can ever tell
Everything I hold within my heart
You know it's something that I just feel
Look inside my heart and feel the love it holds for you
Look into these eyes, you'll see it shining through
If you ever have a doubt
When I say we'll never part
All you gotta do is take a look inside my heart
Once in a lifetime
Your true love comes along
Where souls are joined
And two hearts meet
Now that you're here
And you filled my life with song
I am no longer one
Now I am complete
Look inside my heart and feel the love it holds for you
Look into these eyes, you'll see it shining through
If you ever have a doubt, when I say we'll never part
All you gotta do is take a look inside my heart
All you gotta do is take a look inside my heart
