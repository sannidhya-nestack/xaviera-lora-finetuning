These highway 40 blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Counted the days since I've been gone
I'd love to see the lights of home (I'd love to see the lights of home)
Wasted time and money too
I squandered youth in search of truth
But in the end I had to lose
Lord above have paid my dues
God damn highway 40 blues
Highway called when I was young
It told me last things to come
Fame and fortune lies ahead
That's what the billboard lights had said
Squandered dreams my mind is numb
The money's gone, stick out my thumb
Eyes are filled with bitter tears
Lord, I ain't been home in years
Got them Hannah wear 40 blues
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Highway 40 blue
You know I've rambled all around
Like a rolling stone from town to town
(No I'm a rolling stone)
Met pretty girls I'd have to say
But none of them could make me stay
I played the musicals in bars
Had fancy clothes and big fine cars
Things an E .G. boy can't use
I miss my own homeland, it's true
Got them highway forty blues
Got them highway 40 blues
