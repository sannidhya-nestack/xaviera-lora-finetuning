I'm laying around in the middle of the day
And I'm trying to pretend that I'm clear and okay
But I'm not and I can't seem to get away
On my knees in the night saying prayers
I don't like anything for the light
But I don't want to fight
And the glass is never shattered like it did last night
And that bathroom door
Will never be right,'cause I kicked the thing out like that makes it alright
And I'll tell you this now, not to give you a fright
But to give you the sight that I lacked last night
When I couldn't see anything past my own nose
And the girl told me no, and I had to explode
And I took up a sword, and I knocked out my doors
And I ended up spending the night on the floor
Time to time it comes around, tears hit the ground
And everybody wants to be strong, pound for pound
And every once in a while, you're on bended knee
Watching the sweat rain down from your grill
In slow motion effect, your blood conquers your will
Your eyes close and everything is suddenly so real
That's when you stop and realize the whole thing's a mess
You couldn't clean it up if you burned the whole damn address
But still we press
Forward and we don't regress
Thinking that by making it clean we can make it fresh
I remember letting my head rest
Bleeding to death
And wondering if I would ever catch my breath
And in that test
Becoming clear about life's best
And even if I messed it all up I was still blessed
It's like a candle burning in the wild west
Dripping all over your desk
Randomly wax builds upon the rest
When the time comes to say me say
I've been waiting all my life for this
I just pray that I carry through
You don't always have to be the best
You just do what you have to do
But life's a freakin' circle, ain't it funny how it comes around
Thought you got away, but you were really just a bloodhound
Homebound, lookin' for your voice to resound
But the piece of you you punked was never really underground
Yo, you call yourself a square, but you're as round as any ball
Lay down on a straight line, you'll do nothin' but fall
Footsteps are on the path already that you claim you're blazin'
You'll be back to meet yourself and everything amazing
You're like a dog chasing its tail if you be human
You can't deny the Gemini duality consuming
Everything you do and everywhere you go
Back and forth like a yo-yo and everything you know
You're the only way to keep yourself from spinning like a dreidel
Is latch yourself to Mobius and let it make you able
Yo, you won't get away from it, the steel is gonna squeal
But at least the truth will be there when you reinvent the wheel, come on
I've been waiting all my life for this
I just pray that I carry through
You don't always have to be the best
You just do what you have to do
So I begin to befriend all the things I've been
And I'm seeing in the end it's an upward trend
But you wouldn't believe the trouble that I've seen since then
And I grab and I clutch and I break this pen
And I don't even remember all the men I've been
From the top to the end I go back again
And when I'm slammed on the floor I'll get up once more
And it won't mean a thing if I don't come forth
And I walk to the end of this blackout rage
And I sweat and I fret and I bend this cage
And I scratch in the dirt and I make things bleed
And I draw from the hurt all the strength I need
And I know that to grow I'ma hurt like woe
But I can never ever ever let it stop this flow
I've been waiting all my life for this
I just pray that I carry through
You don't always have to be the best
You just do what you have to do
