Seeped in sorrow, lost without escape
My hands are bound by cords I cannot break
Seeped in sorrow, lost without escape
My heart is bound by cords I cannot break
Please Lord, wash away my shame
My shame
I've hurt us so long
It cost so much pain
Consider the lights
They shine from deep inside
My body is weary and you my strength reside
Consider the lights
They shine from deep inside
My body is weary and you my strength reside
And you my strength reside
Oh please wash
Oh, in my shame
I've hurt us so long
It caused so much pain
Sick to sorrow, lost without escape
My heart is, my heart is, my heart is closed
Love is what shaped me up, my shape
I've been so alone
It can cause so much pain to say goodnight
