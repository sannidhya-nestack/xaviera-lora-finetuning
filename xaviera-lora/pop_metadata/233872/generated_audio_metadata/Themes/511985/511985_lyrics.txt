I'd been waiting all my life for someone like you
I had a picture in my mind and then I met you
You were the one that I'd been searching for
You are the man that I'll love forevermore
And I'm so proud
To be standing by your side
To be your wife
For now and always
I'm so proud
To wake up every morning to those eyes that shine back into mine
That say I'm yours forever, I'm so proud
Now we have the rest of our lives to be together
I have a picture in my mind and it only gets better
We'll live in a house built on our hopes and dreams
A castle we'll fill each day with memories
And I am so proud
To be standing by your side
To be your wife for now and always
I'm so proud
To wake up every morning to those eyes that shine
Back into mine that say I'm yours forever
I'm so proud, so proud of you
And I promise you'll always be proud of me too
there's nothing that I cannot do when I
I am next to you and I'm so proud
To have you in my life, to be your wife
For now and always, I'm so proud
