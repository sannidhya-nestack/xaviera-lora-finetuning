I need you to kiss you but I always miss the mark
Embarrassed to say it but I'm off arms at the start
You'd think by now I'd have it
You'd think by now I'd know what to do
Dragging my feet, tripping like I never should
Algebra that's no sweat
Calculus don't bother me
But I'll show my love for you
With the clumsiness of a clever man
I'm always floating somewhere above the clouds
Nothing to run into, at least I won't hurt myself
You think by now I'd see it, you think by now I'd know when you're hurt
Too smart for half to know what I never learned
Chemistry that's our path
Fell asleep in biology
But I'll show my love for you
With the clumsiness of a clever man
The clumsiness of a clever man
Physics girl I've come down
Family angle in geometry
But I'll show my love for you
With the clumsiness of a clever man
History seen it before
Skipped all the lines in poetry
But I'll show my love for you
With the clumsiness of a clever man
Clumsiness of a clever man
