Most of the time my smile is real
I know how to put on a happy face
But if the world keeps on dropping bombs on me
There isn't much more I can take
I can feel it burning, burning
Temperature is getting higher
I can feel it burning, burning
Get back, I'm gonna start a fire
Oh you think I'm smooth
But that's just the surface of my skin
I got hot lava burning through my veins
A fire you can never comprehend
I'm a volcano
Everything's cool'til I explode
I'm a volcano
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I know I'm playing hard to get
But so far you've passed every test
But nothing you've ever felt before
Can't prepare you for what's gonna happen next
I can feel it burning, burning
Almost too hot to handle
I can feel it burning, burning
So hot it's gonna melt your candle
Oh, you think I'm smooth, but that's just the surface of my skin
I got hot lava burning through my veins
A fire you can never comprehend
I'm a volcano
Everything's cool'til I explode
I'm a volcano
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You got all my good side
And that's where you should stay
You've got to believe me
It's much better this way
You've got all my good side
And that's where you should stay
You've got to believe me
It's much better this way
Oh you think I'm smooth
But that's just the surface of my skin
I got hot lava burning through my veins
A fire you can never comprehend
I'm a volcano
Everything's cool till I explode
I'm a volcano
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
