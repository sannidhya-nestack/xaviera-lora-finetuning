East side, girl's night, kicking it'til last call
Midnight, surprise, you still live here after all
Thought we had something, not like it was just one night
You ghosted, you know it
Now you better tell me why, oh-oh-oh
Don't try to smooth it over
Don't want your sugar coat, no
Give it to me straight, I can take
The hard stuff you ain't take
It won't knock me down or black me out
Honey, let it hurt every word
Gonna burn like hell at first
Don't dilute the truth with some excuse
Just let it hit me and don't wanna down my whiskey
You meant to call me, really?
Life just got so busy
Guess your mama ot to teach you common courtesy
Oh, guess it wasn't meant to be
I got all the proof I need, yeah
Give it to me straight, I can take
The hard stuff you ain't sayin'
It won't knock me down or black me out
Honey let it hurt every word
Gonna burn like hell at first
Don't dilute the truth with some excuse
Just let it hit me don't water down my whiskey yeah
Don't water, don't water down my whiskey
You need it to me straight I can take
The hard stuff you ain't saying
It won't knock me down or black me out
Help me let it hurt every word
Gonna burn like hell it bursts
Don't dilute the truth
Don't play it cool
Don't put on moves
Don't say you miss me
I don't wanna down my whiskey
