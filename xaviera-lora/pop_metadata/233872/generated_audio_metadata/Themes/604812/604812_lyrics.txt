We can feel you in our hearts
Love we have will never part
And it seems like only yesterday
That our lives were in dismay
We can see you in our dreams
Hope is gone although it seems
We are here today to let you know
That our love is here to show
We remember you
We'll always care for you
You're not otten
Our thoughts are toward you
In our hearts you'll stand
Forever and always, you're not otten, our love is true
We will remember
We remember you
We will remember
Number New
