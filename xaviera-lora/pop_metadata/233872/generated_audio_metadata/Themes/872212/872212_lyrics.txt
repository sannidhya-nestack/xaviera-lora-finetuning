It's okay to fill your heart with love until it bursts
The little pieces scatter all around the universe
Just like shooting stars they'll burn across the icy sky
Then people make a wish and kiss and hope that they can find
One more chance to feel like this
To just let go and fly
Free fall into love every chance you get
For we fall into love
To feel the full effect
For we fall into love
Every chance you get
For we fall into love
Crazy things start making perfect sense inside your brain
When you're leaping out of a perfectly working aeroplane
You feel the rush
Is this love, is this love, is this love?
Oh just let go and fly
For we fall into love
Every chance you get
For we fall into love
To feel the full effect
For we fall into love (we fall into love)
Every chance you get
For we fall into love
It's all, it's all love
Dogs and kids know how it's done
When you come home they run into your arms
They free fall into love (free fall into love)
Every chance they get
For we fall into love
To feel the full effect
So for we fall into love (we fall into love)
Every chance you get
For we fall into love
