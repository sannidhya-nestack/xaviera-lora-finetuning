So many times before we met I thought
That all that life for me was enough
But now it's clear I only wasted time
And you're here to save my life
Baby you don't know how many years
I've been looking for love
Baby you don't know how many years I've been looking for you
Baby you don't know how many years I've been looking for love
Baby you don't know how many years I've being looking for you
So many times before I took the road
That road it kept me far away from you
But now it's clear I've only wasted time
You're the one who makes me feel alive
Baby you don't know how many years I've been looking for love
Baby you don't know how many years I've been looking for you
Baby you don't know how many years I've been looking for love
Baby you don't know how many years I've being looking for you
Baby you don't know how many years I've been looking for love
Baby you don't know how many years I've been looking for you
Baby you don't know how many years I've being looking for love
Baby you don't know how many years I've been looking for you
