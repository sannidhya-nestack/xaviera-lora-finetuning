If I go down bitch I'm posting bail
I can't see the cell I be getting money
Broke niggas out here rapping with no money

Got some niggas in the fans doing numbers
We gone ball we gone shine all summer
You can't see me nigga call me Mr. Wonder
In the real nigga, always keep it 100
Terminated nigga, no John Connor
Oh, Avis Keith, pull up in a Hummer
With a pack of pills, fits a Remy Martin
Nigga wants to smoke, we gon' get it sparkin'
Keep a rocket launcher, no James Harden
But your big bulls bite, no barking
Varmar nigga, put'em in the coffin
I be whippin' past, trappin' with the gas

Run up on me bet another nigga die
Bitches flock us when we rap back

Any nigga run up on us I'ma side

Rolling back woods we be getting fried
Keep a nina on me back them shells fly

Fuck the discussion no talking we fine
Henny and Remy on my back to bash it
You can get it how the fuck you want it
30 pop all that glizzy or maxi
Group of young niggas with me bout that action
Pull up on your blocks lights the camera action
Fuck you thought this was bitch we not for acting
On the dick homies broad spit your cabbage
All that talk talkin' on Twitter, now he in a panic
Wonder how I do that, it's magic
Spot me a oppie, gon' drop like bad habits
Shots fired, man, damn shit get tragic
Spot on God, I'm left from stress on Pulaski
You lackin', you snoozin', you all off your square
Finessin' this shit, they like, "Bro, that ain't fair"
I tip smoke, smoke a nigga, no care
I'm killin' this shit, get the Reese of your prayer
You flossin', we do not believe you, it's clear
It's money game, take a picture, we here
It's business over, bitches, just to be clear
I be whippin' past, trappin' with the gas
Any nigga run up on us, I'ma side
You ain't gettin' money, you be tellin' lies
Anything I want
Bitch I could buy, rolling back woods, we be getting fried
Keep a nina on me, bet them she a flyer
Run up on me, bet another nigga die
Bitches flock us when we ride back
I be whipping past, trapping with the guys
Any nigga run up on us, I'ma side
You ain't getting money, you be telling lies
Anything I want, bitch I could buy
Rolling back woods, we be getting fried
Keep a nina on me, bet them she flyer
Run up on me, bet another nigga die
Bitches flock us when we ride back
