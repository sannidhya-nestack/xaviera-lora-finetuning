You see, it's been so long since I felt this way
Way about anyone
I find myself just looking around, hoping just to see you
Maybe it's those clear blue eyes, or golden eyes
Baby, you're all that I want
You know I'm
Shivering, shivering from your looks
Shaking, shaking waiting for your touch
For your touch
You know that I've been chasing after you
I can't seem to catch up
You always seem so difficult
Maybe that's why I like you so much
And just to see you smiling at me
The fire in your eyes is so blinding
Baby, I can't help it
Shiver, I'm shivering from your love words
Shaking, I'm waiting for your touch, for your touch
You know I just want, I wanna feel your love, feel your love
Yes, I'm shivering from your love
Yes, I'm shaking from your touch
From your touch
Yes, I'm shivering
Shimmering, shimmering from your touch
Shimmering, shimmering from your looks
Shaking, waiting for your touch
You know I just want, wanna feel your touch
And I'll do anything, anything for your love
You see it's been so long since I felt this way, way about anyone
