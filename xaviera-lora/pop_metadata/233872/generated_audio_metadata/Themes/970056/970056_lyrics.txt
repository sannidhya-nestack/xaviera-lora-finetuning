It's too easy to find a new distraction
And I'm already lost in the clouds floating'round my head
But you get me with a loud and clear connection
It's like the crack of a baseball bat and I'm running home again
So are you
You can slip your fingers in between mine
And I, I just keep on living to see that smile
But there's something strangely familiar
It happens when we detach ourselves from the machines
And that something takes over our senses
We haven't felt this way in ages
We catch our breath and breathe it deep
So we use
You just slip your fingers in between mine and I
I'll just keep on living to see that smile'cause we
We got miles and miles to go
We're knit together like two sleeves of a sweater
Two arms around each other we'll go all around the world
When you're burning up, I'm your shady tree
And when my mouth's a dusty cotton field
You're my sweet iced tea
And I'm so pleased that you're with me, yeah
So you
You just slip your fingers in between mine and I
I'll just keep on living to see that smile'cause we
We got miles and miles to go
