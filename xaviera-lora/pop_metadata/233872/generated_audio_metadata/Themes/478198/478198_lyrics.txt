When she smiles, you feel the sunshine
Do I have to be with her all of the time?
A nasty thought hovers
I just might not be a very good mother
Her worst days are days with keeping
Why do I love her the best when she is sleeping
A nasty thought haunts me
I just might not be a very good mommy
But my love for her, you know it's bigger, it's more
Than any other love I ever felt before
It's a love I've never had for any lover
This is the mother of love, the love of a mother
My life is not what I pictured
Everywhere I look there's this constant fixture
And there isn't a minute
A breath I take, but she's not in it
But my love for her, you know it's bigger, it's more
Than any other love I ever felt before
It's a love I've never had for any lover
This is the mother of love
The love of a mother
She is sickening sweet
She's wickedly funny
Just what she gives me you can't get for money
Sometimes I just shudder
I'm just so proud to be her mother
When she smiles you feel the sunshine and hey hey
You try getting her shoes on, getting out of the house on time
It's always a drama
It's all a part of being a mama
It's the love of a mother
It's the mother of love
The love of a mother
It's the mother of love, the love of a mother
It's the mother of love, the love of all mothers
