Yeah, infinite, Solomon, let's get it
Spirits left to visit took me out the trenches
Boyo Heights dealing I was living reckless
Check my resume before you ask me questions
Willing to die before I starve don't you second guess it
Tell me why I'm living tell me what's my purpose
God gave me glory, devil gave me curses
Spirits let me know, I'm walking with the serpents
Cut the heads off these snakes and feed them to my servants
I can't trust the soul, just the holy ghost
They was sleeping on me, now it's comatose
Gangsters sleeping at they parents and they left to boast
All those death threats, what have your family gone?
Make it hit if I have to like I'm Barry Bones
Life ain't for the weak, so they smoking strong
Used to be that way until I met my God
Toxins out my body, now I'm spitting venom
Table seem to turn, don't you remember?
You see me struggle, kick me down, don't you remember?
I never needed help, now I get the message
Thought I was alone, I had divine presence
Give me everything, that's a real exchange
Look into my soul, I got expensive pain
Critics think they know me, they just know the face
When I step up in the booth, uh, that's a murder case
Feeling like I'm 80, big OG, had to move the cane
I made it out the streets so I can't complain
I've sold it all except my soul for some fame
Real DNA all these other rappers can't relate
I'd rather die a king and see my mother through those pearly gates
I got too much on my plate my life's a big buffet
Looking in the mirror I'm not quite the same
Spirits on my side reveal it all so when I sleep I'm awake
Table seem to turn, don't you remember? You see me struggle, kick me down, don't you remember? I never needed help, now I get the message Thought I was alone, I had divine presence
Tables seem to turn, don't you remember?
You see me struggle, kick me down, don't you remember?
I never needed help, now I get the message
Thought I was alone, I had divine presence
