Turn the music on, put some rum in my cup
Got a spot on the beach, let's see what we could dream up
Got my old guitar, playing songs in the breeze
Got nowhere else to be, just doing what we please
We're gonna take it real slow
We're gonna go with the flow
This is summertime
This is summertime
This is summertime
This is summertime
Paradise in the sand
On the beach walking hand in hand
This is summertime
Got you on my mind
Sangarita wine
This is summer time
Coconut rum and soaking in the sun
Sun tan lies, let's leave the world behind
The smell of the beach and your sun-kissed hair
Got me feeling strong'bout having no cares
No worries on my mind
This is summertime
No worries on my mind
This is summertime
Coconut rum and soaking in the sun
Sun tan lines, let's leave the world behind
This is summertime
This is summertime
This is summertime
This is summertime
Now put that rum in my cup
And put your arms around me
