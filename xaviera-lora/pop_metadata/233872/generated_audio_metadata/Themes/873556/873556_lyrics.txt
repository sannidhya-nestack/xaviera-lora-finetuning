It's Independence Day (what what) it's Independence Day (what what) it's Independence day (what what) it's Independence Day (that's what I thought you said)
Some people like Christmas, for some it's Halloween
But I'm down with the fourth, if you know what I mean
It's got fireworks and barbecue, national pride
Canada and Mexico, please step aside
We fought the British and threw all our tea
Into the harbor in the name of liberty
Washington and Franklin, they founded this place
Sam Adams, John Hancock, they'll punch you in the face
Badmouth America, well don't even try
Just raise a glass and happy Fourth of July
It's Independence Day
What, what, it's Independence Day
It's what I thought you said, it's Independence Day
What, what, it's Independence Day
It's what I thought you said
We have dinner at home, then wait until dark
Then go out as a family, walk down to the park
The town fireworks show always be killin'
The grand finale, you know that's killin'
A late night treat, oh man we're in luck
Here come the friendly neighborhood ice cream truck
The weather in July is so hot it's tropical
I order us a round of red, white, and blue popsicles
I reach into my pocket but something is wrong
My wallet is missing, oh where has it gone?
I got no money to pay the ice cream guy
But he just smiles and says, "Happy Fourth of July"
It's Independence Day (what, what?)
It's Independence Day (that's what I thought you said)
It's Independence Day
What, what? Independence Day, that's what I thought you said
It's the highlight of the summer, it's my favorite time
It inspires me to write these mad nasty rhymes
Stringin' prose together, I'll show you how it's done
Like the Declaration of Independence by Thomas Jefferson
These truths are self-evident, another famous line
So don't get out on my desk, let's start shakin' yo' behind
We're gonna party down to the break of dawn
our founding fathers knew how to get it on
Them days by the rocks got an endless supply
So let's light'em up
And happy 4th of July
It's Independence Day (what what)
It's Independence Day
That's what I thought you said
It's Independence Day (what what)
It's Independence Day
That's what I thought you said
It's Independence Day (what what)
It's Independence Day
That's what I thought you said
It's Independence Day (what what)
It's Independence Day
That's what I thought you said
