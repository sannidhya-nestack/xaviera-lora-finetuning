School was winding down, soon we'd be out on our own
We knew all there was to know, except where we were going
When the bell rang you said farewell my friend
But that night your road came to an end
And heaven welcomed you home
One thing always keeps us together
In a world where nothing's forever
Only love survives
For all our lives
Only love
We gathered at your church today
All wondering what it meant
When life's cut short the real important things can be hard to comprehend
And when the bell rang we gave our last goodbyes
Looked around and I realized that God blessed us with good friends
And one thing always keeps us together
In a world where nothing's forever
Only love survives for all our lives
Only love
Today I found some words to follow
To live like there is no tomorrow
And I'll be ready when angels come along
To carry me, to carry me, to carry me home
The one thing always keeps us together
In a world where nothing's forever
Only love survives
For all our lives
It's only love
Oh, and one thing always keeps us together
Yeah, in a little world like this where nothing's gonna last forever
Only love survives for all our lives
It's only love, oh, oh
Only love survives for all our lives
It's only love
