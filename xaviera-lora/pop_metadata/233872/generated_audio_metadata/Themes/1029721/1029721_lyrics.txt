Dancing with the moon
I hope to be home soon
So I'm dancing with the moon
I hope to be home soon
I'm out all night too drunk to go home
Dancing in the moonlight I'm all alone
No long or strong to stand with this heart
Love was so full from the very start
She is smart, very pure
Her love was my cure
I'm out alone hearing my favorite song
Riding on the road so far along hearing my song
I'll be home soon, but now
I'm dancing with the moon
Will I be home soon?
I will
When I'm dancing with the moon
I'm dancing with the moon
Will I be home soon?
I will
When I'm dancing with the moon
I'm on my way home to be with my kids
Their mom's calling, mad as shit
I don't wanna go home to listen to it
I can't do it
Turn around sounds like I'm headed back, back to the bar
Time to party like a star
For good or evil to know who you are in the dark
Well I can't see
Blind by the facts
That night got an alcohol disease
A chronic drunk that fell over a stump
Only to never get up and stuck
Dancing with the moonlight
I hope I go home soon
I'm dancing with the moonlight
Dancing with the moonlight
I hope I go home soon
I'm dancing with the moonlight
As the days go by now
I'm alone, my family is gone
Waiting for divorce papers
Where did my life go wrong?
Singing a sad song when I'm all alone
Dancing with the moonlight as long as it can be
Only to see what I see
Is the moonlight got the best of me
Life in my own shadow was a friend of mine
One of a kind lost in a storm
I hope I'll be home soon
When I'm dancing with the moon
