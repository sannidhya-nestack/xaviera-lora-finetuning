Admit it, this could be your day
We make it too hard to ever say
Your blanket, wear it until the grave
Arrangement
Buried to find the way
Feel the relief
Brought yourself along
Fear of leaving
Times that it went wrong
Happiness in what you choose
It's in the love
I now have enough to lose
I have it
I have it
Unveiling
Too hard to make you stay
Demanding
Now it's the only way
Feel the thrilling
Brought yourself along
Fear of naming
Times that it went wrong
Happiness in what you choose
It's in the love
I now have enough to lose
I have it
I have it
Evidence in what you see
It's in the blood
I've been running from the need
Evaded, evaded
