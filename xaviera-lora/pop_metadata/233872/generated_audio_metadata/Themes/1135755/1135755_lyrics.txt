Overbear
Break the backs on those who choose to stay
Intimidate
Just a different way to play your game
Shame but a dual face
It's your philosophy to rule is metry
And all you need
Threaten it
The boring ways that you were always pushing
Petrified
And you won't take away the means that they need
Come so easy
The role of the thought believe
And it's even what you're born to do
Don't you ever fuckin' say to me
I will crush your plan, just wait and see
Three dilemmas
What, what, what?
Are you telling me what's right?
What, what, what?
Silver spoon fed stereotype
What, what, what?
And the
Snake! (One! One! One!)
Walk this path to me and you will die!
A singing lock, always play the friend but never help it fake a smile
You turn on the good for selfish gain, your life a disgrace
You serve the souls for a ransom that you'll never see
Slither back, smell the blood, you moving like a shark
It's a pay off act, but the day will come not soon enough
A fool to trust him, he'll sell you down the river
When you've lost your use, you'll see
Don't you ever fuck except to me
I will crush your plan, just wait and see
Read the lemon
Are you telling me what's right? (One, one, one)
Silver-throated stereotype (One, one, one)
And a snake (One, one, one)
Walk this path to me and you will die
I will crush your plan, you just wait and see
Redundant mud
One, one, one
Are you telling me what's right?
One, one, one
Silver spoon fed stereotype
One, one, one
And the
Snake! (One, one, one)
Walk this path to me and you will die
