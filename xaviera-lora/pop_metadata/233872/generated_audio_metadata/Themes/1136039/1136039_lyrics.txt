Sunbeams glimmer down, glisten in the dew
Birds in the yard, sing an old familiar tune
There's dogs walking people, downtown in the park
And I'm waiting for coffee in the Tim Hortons parking lot
There's a sweet smell of springtime in the air
And I'm living my life without a
A care in the world
And I don't, no I don't
I don't, I don't regret anything
Life ain't always innocent and sweet
Sometimes it bleeds
Ignorance and hate
I've been to
The dark end of the street
I've hung out in places
Where lost souls congregate
And I don't, no I don't
I don't, I don't regret a thing
But I can't et
What I've learned along the way
And the picture life has painted
It may not look like I planned
Little imperfections
They make me who I am
And I don't, no I don't
I don't, I don't regret a thing
