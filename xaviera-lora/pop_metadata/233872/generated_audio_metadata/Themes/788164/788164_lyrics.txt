Valentine, valentine, valentine, valentine
Will you be my valentine and dance with me tonight
Will you be my valentine together we look right
Will you be my valentine I want the world to know
How much I love you so
Will you be my Valentine?
Tonight I'm in the mood
Will you be my Valentine?
Together we look good
Will you be my Valentine?
The stars are shining bright
For me and you tonight
Valentine, yeah, Valentine
Valentine, Valentine
Valentine, Valentine, Valentine, Valentine
I want all the world to know I love you
I want all the world to know I care
I'll take all my love for you with me
I'll take all my dreams everywhere
Valentine, Valentine
Valentine, Valentine
Will you be my Valentine? Love is in the air
Will you be my Valentine? It's true, I really care
Will you be my Valentine? We'll make a special pair
Love is everywhere
Will you be my Valentine and dance with me tonight
Will you be my Valentine together we look right
Will you be my Valentine I want the world to know how much I love you so
Valentine, Valentine
Valentine, valentine

Valentine, valentine
Valentine, Valentine, Valentine, Valentine
