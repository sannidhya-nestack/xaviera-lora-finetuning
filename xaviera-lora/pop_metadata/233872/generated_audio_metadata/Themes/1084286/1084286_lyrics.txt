I love you mom, that's why I wrote this song
I'm not too good with words
I can't sing to save my honey but I love you mom
I hope you get the point
I didn't have the cash for a card
I stayed up late and worked real hard
I wrote this song just for you
No other mother will ever do
What you do for me
I love you mom with all my heart
And every day in every way
I promise you I will say
I love you mom
