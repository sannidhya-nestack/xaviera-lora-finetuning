(I'm just a fool)
(I'm just a fool)
I saw P Diddy on TV
He was begging for his life
His only consolation
Is he doesn't have a wife
Said he did some awful things
That brought him close to tears
Now he's sitting in the slammer
Where he's gonna stay for years
Now mama wants her baby out now
And this is how it came about
His karma gave us all a shower
So only mama wants her diddy out
I'd rather be his mama
Than his girlfriend on a date
At least his sweet old mama
He might appreciate
We watched him kick his girlfriend
As she scrambled for her life
She barely got out safely
But so glad she ain't his wife
Now mama wants her baby out
And this is how it came about
His karma gave us all a shower
So only mama wants her diddy out
He was having all the fun
With his victims passed out cold
To the big and tough P. Diddy
It was never getting old
Thinking he could never
Be put away forever
Lost everything he had
he was truly very bad
Now mama wants her baby out (out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out
And this is how it came about (it came about)
His karma gave us all a shower (all a shower)
So only mama wants her daddy out (out, out, out)
Yeah only mama wants her daddy out
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
