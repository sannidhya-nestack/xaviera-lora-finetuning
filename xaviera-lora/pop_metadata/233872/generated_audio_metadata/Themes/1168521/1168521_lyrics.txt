Shibbidy-biddy-beep, shuffle'em up
Deal'em right, luck of the draws with me too
I don't need no ace up my sleeve
Shibbidy-shibbidy, roll the dice, I don't mind
Shake'em, shake'em, shake'em as long as you like
When lady luck is smiling back at me
When Lady Luck is smiling, smiling back at me
I feel like a king and I could just sing
She be dee be dee be dee be she
She spins the bottle points right at me
Bless my eyes what do I see
Lady Luck is smiling back at me

Three and two, hey badda badda coming right up
Swing and a miss is all you're gonna see

Take a number yeah take your seat
Well lady luck is smiling back at me
When Lady Luck is smiling, smiling back at me
I feel like a king and I can just sing

She spins the bottle points right at me
