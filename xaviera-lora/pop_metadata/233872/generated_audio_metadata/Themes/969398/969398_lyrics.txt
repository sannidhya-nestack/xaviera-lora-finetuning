Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We did the time, feeling out the situation
Long walks, holding hands and behaving
Doing everything the innocent way
Gets harder every day
All the things we did to get to know each other
Fancy restaurants even though you can't afford it
Something deeper and I wanna explore it
I know it's worth the wait
How I feel when close ain't close enough
Honestly I couldn't want you more
Looking at you I can tell that you're aching for my touch
Let's do what is necessary
Take it to the sanctuary
Naughty stuff for two
That's what I really wanted to
Shut the door and climb up on your magic bus
Nothing but a sheet of cotton calling us
Yeah, it'd be some alone time with you
That's what I really wanted to
A little getaway in the Bahamas
Knocking dishes off the kitchen counter
You can leave on your sandals if you wanna
I'm down for whatever
Unleash the werewolf, I can be your prey
Hungry eyes leave your marks on me for days
You can keep on keep on making me a natural woman
Let's do what is necessary
Take it to the sanctuary
Naughty stuff for two
That's what I really wanted to
Shut the door and climb up on your magic bus
Nothing but a sheet of cotton calling us
Yeah, it'd be some alone time with you
That's what I really wanted to
Let's do what is necessary
To take it to the sanctuary
The party's set for two
That's what I really wanna do
Shut the door and climb up on your magic bus
Nothing but a sheet of cotton calling us
Give me some alone time with you
That's what I really wanna do
Alone time with you, it's what I really wanna do
