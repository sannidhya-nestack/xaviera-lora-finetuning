I can see by your eyes
You're telling me goodbye
Is it something that I said
Or maybe something you got in your head
This is breaking us in two
I'm not really sure what to do
Honey I know you're scared
It's a feeling that I share
But I will promise you anything
More than I have to give
And you are my everything
The only reason I live
And I would do anything
If you would just stay here and live with me
When you talk the way you do
I know this isn't really you
Now let's try to work this through
And honey, know this is true
I will promise you anything more than I have to give
And you are my everything, the only reason I live
And I would do anything if you would just stay here and live with me
Here we are once again
Babe you know that you're my best friend
And there's nothing I wouldn't do
I'm hopelessly in love with you
I am here and always will be
I'll be here holding your hand
And I'll always be your man
Honey please understand
I will promise you anything
More than I have to give
And you are my everything
The only reason I live
And I would do anything
If you would just stay here and live with me
