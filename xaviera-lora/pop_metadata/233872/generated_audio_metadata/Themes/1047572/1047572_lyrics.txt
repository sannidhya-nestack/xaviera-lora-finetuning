And when the years come down
All the seasons won't go
And when the light goes out
All the secrets won't go
But Hayley, Hayley, it's already gone
All this time I've been calling mine
Hayley, Hayley, it's already here
All these answers before their time
And though the clock does work, we've erased that time
I can only hold this badge and designate my son
And now I'm feeling still, these wishes won't be worn
Oh, the other weather hurts, been fading all along
Oh, but highly, highly, it's already gone
All this time I've been calling mine
Highly, highly, it's already here
All these answers before their time
The right city, the right time, all in my face
The right city, the right time, all out of place
The right city, the right time, all in my face
The right city, the right time, all out of place
All this time I've been calling but
Hey Lee, hey Lee, it's already here
All these answers before their time
Haley, Haley, it's already gone
All this time I've been calling mine
Haley, Haley, it's already here
All these answers before their time
All this time I've been calling mine
Haley, it's already here
