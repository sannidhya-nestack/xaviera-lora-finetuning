Melon, melon, melon, melon, melon
Here comes again that melancholy moon
Reminding me of days forever gone, days of bloom
You and I would dance under the moon
Here comes again that melancholy tune
Reminding me of days forever lost, days of bliss
When everything ended in a kiss
Wish I could turn the hands of time
Back to the days when you were mine
Oh when the sun above sang a song of love
Back to the days forever gone
Melancholy moon (Melancholy moon)
Forever haunts me, steals upon me in the night (forever)
Forever taught me, what a lonely soul am I
Standing high and dry
Here comes again that melancholy tune
Reminding me of a love forever lost
Reminding me of you
Do I hate that melancholy mood?
Wish I could turn the hands of time
Back to the days when you were mine
Oh when the sun above sang a song of love
Back to the days forever gone
Melancholy mood (Melancholy)
Forever haunts me, steals upon me in the night (In the night)
Forever taunts me, what a lonely soul am I
Standing high and dry (Melancholy mood)
Forever haunts me
No consolation
Melancholy mood
Melancholy mood
Melancholy
