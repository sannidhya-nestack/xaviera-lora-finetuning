Kung-Fu kickin' off our shoes right into the pool
Spin spin lost inside the fog lasers on the lawn
Fashion police is frontin' through nothin' they can do
They got no badge we're outta hand we can't stop now
We're bustin' out out out
We're finally free, we're bustin' out and we can't stop now
We're bustin' out, out, out
We're finally free, we're bustin' out and we can't stop now
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
We're bustin' out and we can't stop now, not now, not now
Na na na na, na na na na
We're busted out and we can't stop now
Na na na, na na na
Kung fu kicking off our shoes
Right into the pool
Spin spin, lost inside the fog
Laces on the lawn
Fashion police is frontin' route
Nothing they can do, they got no badge
We're out of hand, we can't stop now
We're busted out, out, out
We're finally free
We're busted out and we can't stop now
We're busted out, out, out
We're finally free
We're busted out and we can't stop now
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Nobody's home
We left hours ago
Can't keep up with our flow
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Nobody knows
But wherever we go
We don't need roads
Na na na na, na na na na, we passé la
Na na na na, na na na na, We passé la
We're bustin' out, out, out, we're finally free
We're bustin' out and we can't stop now
We're bustin' out, out, out we're finally free
We're bustin' out and we can't stop now
No no no no, no no no no
We're bustin' out and we can't stop now
Not now, not now
No no no no, no no no no
We're bustin' out and we can't stop now
Not now, not now
