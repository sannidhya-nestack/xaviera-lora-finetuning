You look at me, I look at you
We've otten what to do
We watch the sky falling around us
Take my hand, it's right before us
We love each other
We built a home
Our hearts were in it
It rose up to the sky
We built the love
Within it
We love each other
Looking for the light
In the faces we meet
That phone I talk to
Leaves me frail and weak
We love each other
We loved each other
Now I love her
And she loves me
And that is written down
In history
We love each other
We love each other
