Never just halfway
Mostly invisible
A whisper in the wind
Swirling all around
Love finds its way
Great love is indivisible
Like family at Christmas time
A mom on her special day
Love goes all the way
Even past the stars
The love travels far
Like a swirling wind wraps around a holiday
Love will find its way
Invisible love seals a kiss
In those moments of bliss
It's in a mother's love or an inspiration from above
Love truly finds its way
It's real, this love
It's the breath of life
From somewhere above yet mostly invisible
The love is here to stay
Even past the stars, the love travels far
Like a swirling wind that wraps around a holiday
Love will find its way
Love will find its way
