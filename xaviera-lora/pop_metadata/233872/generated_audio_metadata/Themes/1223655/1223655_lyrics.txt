You can't hide it
Fire burns within your soul
I feel it in my soul
From my head down to my toes
Darkness rises
Humanity has lost control
Cube has took the throne
the darkness got a hold of you
Live in fear, our sanity's make us unfold
Never hesitate, you will never see
Meditate to find love and your inner peace
I don't want that sunshine, that sunshine lights my soul
Tell you a story about a boy who turned his world to gold
Broken
Lift a glitch and freeze your reality
See the truth in moments of clarity
See the world with cruel brutality
Disasters and death like tragedies
I don't fear be sharp as a knife
I'm just here to open your eyes
So you reap what you sow, you sow to survive
Going through the tunnel of life
Heartlessness and inhumanity
Dangerous time, soul soul savagery
Cannot sleep with the moon and its gravity
Lost in space beyond interplanetary
Seek and you will find
What you're searching for
Seek and you will find
What you searching for?
Got a flush on my books down the laboratory
Making social waves with my vanity
Everybody's got their own little charity
Radicals propagating financially
Got this one with clarity
We nah go mix up any of dem war and brutality
One fi treat poor people like charity
One fi divide all di minority
Heartlessness and inhumanity
Dangerous time, soul soul savagery
Cannot sleep with the moon and its gravity
Lost in space beyond interplanetary
Seek and you will find
What you're searching for
Seek and you will find
What you searching for?
Burn them, we a go burn them
Teach them, teach them
Style a me come fi preach them
Rhythmics and the style concern them
Burn them, we a go burn them
Teach them, teach them
Style a me come fi preach them
Rhythmics and the style concern them
Burn'em, burn'em, burn'em, burn'em
