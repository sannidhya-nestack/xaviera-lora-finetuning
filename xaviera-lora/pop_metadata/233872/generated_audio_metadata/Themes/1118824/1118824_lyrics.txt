The darkest night is all we see
Wait on the nothing we face to face
I've heard about you, you know about me
Already enough not to lose the game
The sweetest touch I've ever felt
The sweetest things I got with your kiss
Let's stay forever in this embrace
Mixing the sunrise with the ocean breeze
Already enough not to lose the game
The sweetest touch I've ever felt
The sweetest things I got with your kiss
Let's stay forever in this embrace
Mixing the sunrise with the ocean breeze
