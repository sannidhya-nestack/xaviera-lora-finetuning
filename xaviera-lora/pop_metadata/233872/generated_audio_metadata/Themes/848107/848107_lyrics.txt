Becoming one with both two lives
No restrictions that I'd give their wives
Our language to wage war against
My rising insurgency must
My heart's not stand
Him me, hurt me
I'm giving all I am
Him me, hurt me
I do the best I can
Him me, hurt me
I never understand
When she belongs to another man
One thousand square miles
More than the leaves of the trees
One decade long but not continuously
One obstruction could kill at the end
Malrising insurgency must
My heart's not staying in me, hurtin' me
I'm giving all I am in me, hurtin' me
I do the best I can in me, hurtin' me
I never understand
She belongs to another man
Behaviors are strange things that can grow in deep
First recognize to make the changes you need
Recognition's not all absent
My rising insurgency must
My heart stand
Hit me, hurt me
I'm giving all I am
Hit me, hurt me
I do the best I can
Hit me, hurt me
I never understand
When she belongs to another man
Not a man, not a man, not a man, not a man
Not a man, not a man, not a man
When she belongs to another
Hit me, hurt me, I'm giving all I am
Hit me, hurt me, I do the best I can
Hit me, hurt me, I never run out
Hit me, hurt me, I'm giving all I am
Hit me, hurt me, I do the best I can
Hit me, hurt me, I never understand
When she belongs to another man
