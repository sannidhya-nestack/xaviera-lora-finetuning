A garden wall with an unelectable lie
We came along with the sun, a cloud, and all the things with which you gave
I'll trade it all with a wrinkling mind
Ask why
I am the one that needs to make it all out
I am the gun that needs to take it all out
I am the son that needs to make it
Headlights over the fire
Calling out loud to see
Headlights over the fire
Calling out loud for me
He likes this more than the fire
More that the fire's gone
Headlights up to the top
Calling on death on me
An average walk in
An undetectable sign
We got it off with a run of cloud and all the things with which I came
We raised it up to a bump in the sky
Ask why I am the one that needs to make it all out
I am the gun that needs to take it all out
I am the song that needs to make it headlong
Headlights on the loofah, calling out loud to see
Headlights on the loofah, calling out loud for me
He likes this more than the fire
More that the fire's gone
Headlights up to the top
Call it under for me
He likes this, he likes this
More than the fire, the fire
More that the fire's gone
Headlights up to the top
Call it under for me
