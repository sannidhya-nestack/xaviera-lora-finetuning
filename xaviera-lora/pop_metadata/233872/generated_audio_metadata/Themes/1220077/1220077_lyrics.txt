Take me back to Carolina
That's where everything feels right
If I come looking I better find ya
Where all of the stars align
Take me home to Carolina
That's the place I call home
Every day there's a reminder
To know I'm not alone
Take my hand, trust in me
A leap of faith is what you need
Call my name and you will see
A place of love, a place of peace
'Cause Carolina's all I need
Take me there to Carolina
That's where all my dreams come true
They say absence makes the heart grow fonder
That's where I fell in love with you
Take the road to Carolina
It's an open free flowing highway
If you get lost I better find ya
your essence is in every lane
Take my hand, trust in me
A leap of faith is what you need
Call my name and you will see
A place of love, a place of peace
Care and love is all I need
Need, need, you're all I need, need, need
Take my hand, trust in me
A leap of faith is what you need
And you will see
A place of love, a place of peace
Take my hand, trust in me
A leap of faith is what you need
Call my name and you will see
A place of love, a place of peace
Carolina's all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need
