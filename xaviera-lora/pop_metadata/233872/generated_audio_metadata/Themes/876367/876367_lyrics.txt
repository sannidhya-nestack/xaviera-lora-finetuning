You and I, we got all the tools to work this out, but trouble ends
We can't agree on where to start
Sometimes the answer's right in front of you
Think of all the things we do for people we love
Wait, I'm not finished yet
But I'm done with foolish pride
It's changed my life
More than you know
And no you can't go
I'm done with saying goodbye
Done with the lies
You're saying we're through
But I'm not finished loving you yet
that's all we get
Moments with the people we love
And I'd hate to know
We had love for a lifetime
But we let it go (let it go, oh no)
We're in the weeds and it feels so desperate
But my photographic memory won't let me et
The magic where we met
So I'm done with foolish pride
You've changed my life
More than you know
I know you can't go
I'm done with saying goodbye
Done with the lies
No saying we're through
But I'm not finished loving you
Oh, my photographic memory won't let me et
How I'm not finished yet
But I'm done with foolish pride
You've changed my life
More than you know
And though you can't go
And I'm done with saying goodbye
Done with the lies
Yours and with whom
But I'm not finished loving you
You've changed my life more than you know and I need you so, so
No more goodbyes, nothing we're through but I'm not finished loving you
You changed my life, more than you know
So I need you, so I need you, so yeah
It just don't feel right, when you say we're through
I'm nothing, just loving you
