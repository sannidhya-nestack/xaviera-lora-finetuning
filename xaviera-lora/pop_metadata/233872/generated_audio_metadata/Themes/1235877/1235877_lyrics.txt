Look at me, look at me
A little black box up on the shelf
All of me kept to myself
It's better that way
Look at me, look at me
Am I the person you thought I would be?
Do you even know me?
Honestly, do you care at all?
Look at me, look at me
Am I the strongest person you've ever seen?
Do you think the world of me?
But why do I feel so small
Look at me, look at me
The most beautiful, you tell me
The luckiest in the world, you see
But I always seem to stumble and fall
Here I am, here I am
Standing here right in front of you
This person that you thought you knew
But you never listened
Here I am, here I am
Silently screaming out to you
Begging for the slightest piece of you
But you never heard me, never heard me
Now I'm gone, now I'm gone
Just couldn't handle the noise
Louder than my own voice
What could I do, oh
Now I'm gone, now I'm gone
Loudness now a whisper to be carried on
But please hear the laughter in this song
Oh please for you
Now I'm gone, now I'm gone
Pictures say a thousand words
Do you see the right one?
Remember me as I move on
I smile for truth, for you
Here I am, here I am
Standing here right in front of you
This person that you thought you knew
But you never listened
Here I am, here I am
Silently screaming out to you
Begging for the slightest piece of you
But you never heard me
Never hurt me
