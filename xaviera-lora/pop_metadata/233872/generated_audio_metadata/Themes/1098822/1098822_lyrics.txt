Here I am again, I'm wandering
Why I keep reliving it? Broken spirited
Retreat to save the water heavy under stones
Sinking to the bottom, down in me
Heavy under stone
Heavy under stone
Here I am again, I'm wondering why
I keep reliving it
Broken spirit dead
Retreat to safer water
Heavy under stone
Sinking to the bottom
Doubt in me
Doubt in me
