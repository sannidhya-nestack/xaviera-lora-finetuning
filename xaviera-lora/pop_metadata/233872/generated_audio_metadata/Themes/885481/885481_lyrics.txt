I never thought someone could love me
Like you used to do
You used to do
We found a way to make everyday feel
So exciting and new
I was so into you
Now I can't tell when I look in your eyes
So please just try to love me like you mean it
Give it all or nothing
There's no in between it when it comes to me
Time to show me something, where's your priority?
Love me like you mean it, or else
I want you to love me like you mean it
Give it all or nothing
There's no in between it when it comes to me
There's two ways we can do this
What's it gonna be?
Love me like you mean it, or else
I'm gone
It's like I barely even know you
It's like I'm kissing a statue
Did our love disappear?
I know you can hear me but are you listening?
Just give me a sign, are you even trying?
You're running out of last chances
And we're running out of time
So love me like you mean it
Give it all or nothing
There's no in between it when it comes to me
Time to show me something where's your priority
Love me like you mean it or else
I want you to love me like you mean it
Give it all or nothing
There's no in between it when it comes to me
There's two ways we can do this
What's it gonna be
Love me like you mean it or else
I'm gone to start a fire with somebody else
When you're by yourself
That's when you'll realize what's gone
'Cause I've got a lot of love to give
But I need a whole lot of love to live, to live, to live
Oh, love me like you mean it
Give it all or nothing
There's no in between it when it comes to me
Time to show me something
Where's your priority
Love me like you mean it or else
Love me like you mean it, give it all you got
There's no in between here when it comes to me
There's two ways we can do this, what's it gonna be?
Love me like you mean it or else, or else, or else I'm gone
