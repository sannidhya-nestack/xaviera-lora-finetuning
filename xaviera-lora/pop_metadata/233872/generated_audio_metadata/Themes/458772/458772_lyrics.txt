I've been a wild rover for many a year
And I spent all me money on whiskey and beer
And now I'm returning with gold and great store
And I never will play the wild rover no more
And it's no nay never
No, they never, no more
Will I play the Wild Rover?
No, never, no more
I went into an alehouse I used to frequent
And I told the landlady me money was spent
I asked her for credit, she answered me, "Nay"
She said, "Custom like you I could have any day, and it's no nay, never"
No day never, no more
Well I play the Wild Rover
No never, no more
I reached into my pocket
Ten sovereigns bright
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
She said I've got whiskey and wines of the best
And the words that I told you were only in jest
And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never, no more
Will I play the Wild Rover?
No, never, no more
I'll go home to my parents
Confess what I'd done
And ask them to pardon their prodigal son
And when they caress me like oft times before
I never will play the wild rover no more
And it's no nay never
No, nay, never, no more
Will I play the Wild Rover?
No, never, no more
And it's no, nay, never
No never no more
Will I play the wild rover
No never no more
