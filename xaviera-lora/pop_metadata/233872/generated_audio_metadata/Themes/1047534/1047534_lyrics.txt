I'm free, I am hoping to begin
We are never to control the light we're in
Backbeat, I can feel it flourishing
Now we meet, ready for the open door it brings in
I can't wait for something that's less tragic
I can't wait
I'm gonna hold on, see it through, I can't wait
I'm carrying your magic by my side, I can't wait
But for now, it's all I ever do
Now I finally am listening
I've found when you hear the truth it has a ring
Today I am sure of just one thing
And I can't wait for something that's less tragic
I can't wait, I'm gonna hold on, see it through
I can't wait, I'm carrying your magic by my side
I can't wait
But for now, it's all I ever do
I've had pleasure, I've had pain
Some is gone and some remains
We are floating and I've had to drown to know this
How about that, up ahead in open lane
Thank your stars we got away
We had vision and that's all I ever wanted
And I can't wait
To something that's less tragic
I can't wait
I wanna hold on, see it through
I can't wait
I'm carrying your magic by my side
I can't wait
But for now
It's all I ever do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't wait
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I can't wait
Carrying your magic by my side
I can't wait
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, now
It's all I ever do
It's all I ever do
It's all I ever do
