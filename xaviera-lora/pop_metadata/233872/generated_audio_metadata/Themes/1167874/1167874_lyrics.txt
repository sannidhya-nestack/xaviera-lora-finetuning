Time, time, time, are we wasting time?
Wasting time, wasting space
You're on your own, you're moving on to the next thing
You say you're grown, but you don't know
Let's take it slow, don't run away from a good thing
You're wasting time on the back streets
You're losing sleep, no you can't sleep
You stay up all night through the week
And contemplate what we could be
All in my zone, all alone yeah I'm faded
She pull up on me cause she know I've been waiting
But all she want to do is fucking get wasted
It's all good with me but I'm still underrated
Time, wasting time
Time, why we wasting time
Time, wasting time
Why we wasting time
Why we always wasting time
Why you tryna waste time on me? (Time on me)
I'm not tryna waste time on you (Time on you)
Don't act like you're better than me (Better than me)
And why am I so underrated? (Hey)
Why you wanna waste time? (Why you wanna waste time?)
I'm not tryna waste time (I'm not tryna waste time)
Please don't ask why (Please don't ask why)
And when I'm gone, you're gonna hate it
Wanna wake up to your fear
Last night was Maria
No time to run now
Why can't you just stay here?
Hate the way we left off
Better if I left now
Better off on my own
Gotta find my way back
You hate on the way that I'm living, well why you all up in my business?
You know when I'm up in my feelings, I can't handle any addition
Hold em down just wait a minute, I'm thinking about my decision
I could fly away like a pigeon or just hang around like detention
Time, wasting time
Time, why we wasting time
Time, are we wasting time?
Why are we wasting time?
Why are we always wasting?
Time, are we wasting time?
But we always, but we, but we, but we always listen to time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time
Are you tryna waste time on me? (Time on me)
I'm not tryna waste time on you (Time on you)
Don't act like you better than me (Better than me)
And why am I so underrated? (Hey)
Why you wanna waste time? (Why you wanna waste time?)
I'm not tryna waste time (I'm not tryna waste time)
Please don't ask why (Please don't ask why)
And when I'm gone, you're gonna hate it (Hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it)
Time
