She was back in her voice wondering why
She was heading home to paradise
She knew it was only a matter of time
Balancing the forces side by side
Who you?
What you looking for?
Is there anything I've been anymore?
Come with me if you'd like to explore
I've been waiting to go through this open door
To show you could have it all
But this time, do you afraid of your eyes?
Are you afraid of love?
The love that lies inside
You deserve it all
Everything you've dreamt up in your mind
You're the one to show
Surprise and bright
Finally still in her mind
Stepping back to redesign
What's out there is what's inside
Come to the center and you'll find
You can have it all
It's time to open up your eyes
Yeah, you've got it all, love
Know what lies inside
You deserve it all
Everything you dreamt of in your mind is going on to show
Surprise, surprise
Took a kiss from you, took a kiss from you
You can have it all, stand your ground, wait up your hour, say you've had it all
You know what lies inside
You deserve it all
Everything you dreamt of in your mind
Come on to show
Surprise, surprise
Do you know what you're looking for?
Do you know what you're looking for?
Do you know what you're looking for?
we're looking for you, through it all
