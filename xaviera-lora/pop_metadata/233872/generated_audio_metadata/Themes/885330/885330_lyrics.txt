Mm-mm, oh, yeah, together
It's easy to say we know what's right
Mm-mm, but knowing and doing can be miles apart
We're crying out loud for a God
But we're using different names
World on fire we sit back and watch the flames
It only takes one voice to give us hope
Remind us that we ain't out here doing it on our own
We ain't doing it right
We ain't doing it right
We ain't doing it right unless we're doing it together
We ain't doing it right
We ain't doing it right
We ain't doing it right unless we're doing it together
We feel the sun but we don't see the sky
Thinking it'll work out in the sweet by and by
Then didn't et about the ground beneath our feet
There's nothing more important than the people that we meet
It only takes one thought to change the world
It only takes one heart to help another heart beat
We ain't doing it right (we ain't doing it right)
We ain't doing it right (we ain't doin' it right)
We ain't doing it right (less we're doing it together)
We ain't doing it right, doing it right now
We ain't doing it right, doing it right now
We ain't doing it right unless we're doing it together
Unless we're doing it together
It only takes one voice to give us hope (only takes one voice to give us hope)
Remind us that we ain't out here doing it on our own
We ain't, we ain't doing it right
We ain't doing it, no we ain't doing it right
We ain't doing it right unless we're doing it together, together, yeah
We ain't doing it right (we ain't doing it right) we ain't doing it right (oh oh oh)
We ain't doing it right unless we're doing it together (doing it together)
Unless we're doing it together, no
We ain't doing it right unless we're doing it together
