You give me strength when I'm weak
And oh so tired
You give me rest so I can sleep
To weakens fire
You give me hope when I despair
And I'm at a crossroads
You are the light that comes
Guides me there when it's dark and I feel lonely
If you only knew how much I need you
You could help me through all this pain
You said I do, I've been there already
And I'll take it all away
Lay down your worries, fears and burdens
On my shoulders to carry the weight
And lift you up when you are hurting
Cause I'm here with you everyday
I'm here with you everyday
Every day
Every day
I feel you deep inside my soul
Where my heart feels empty
I know you more when I'm out of control
With your hands so steady
I see you in every person, place or thing
Yeah, you're all around
I listen close to hear you speak when I'm silent
And still I cry out
If you only knew how much I need you
You could help me through all this pain
You said I do, I've been there already
And I'll take it all away
Lay down your worries, fears and burdens
On my shoulders to carry the weight
And lift you up when you are hurting
I'm here with you everyday
I'm here with you every day, every day, every day
