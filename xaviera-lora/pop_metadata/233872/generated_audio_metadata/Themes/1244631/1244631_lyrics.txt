Well I already know how I feel about you
You, you don't let it show
How do you feel about me?
And I can sense you slowing down this ride
And this thought just crossed my mind
But maybe I'm a fool for falling deep
Head over heels, back off my feet
Waiting for the day when you feel the same
And wearing my heart out on my sleeve
Maybe things are moving way too fast
But you'll never know if you don't take a chance
What do you say we give it a try and let me love you?
'Cause you, you say you need time
To figure out your feelings, oh
Well I, I know that you're scared and that your heart is still healing
And I can sense you changing your mind
When I look into your eyes
Maybe I'm a fool for falling deep
Head over heels, back off my feet
Waiting for the day when you feel the same
And wearing my heart out on my sleeve
Baby things are moving way too fast
But you'll never know if you don't take a chance
What do you say
We give it a try let me love you
Love you right
Cause all I wanna be is with you tonight
Holding you close while the fire dies
Higher, I, whoa-oh-oh
And I can sense you changing your mind
When I look into your eyes
Maybe I'm a fool for falling deep
Head over heels, not off my feet
Waiting for the day when you feel the same
And wearing my heart out on my sleeve
Maybe things are moving way too fast
But you'll never know if you don't take a chance
What do you say
We give it a try, let me love you
Love you right
Let me help you (head over heels, back off my feet)
Love you right (waiting for the day when you feel the same)
Feel the same (feel the same)
Well maybe I'm a fool for falling deep
