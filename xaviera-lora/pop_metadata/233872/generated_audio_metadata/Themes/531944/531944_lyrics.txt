Should old acquaintance be ot and never brought to mind?
Should old acquaintance be ot and no lang syne?
Falling sign, my dear, falling sign
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
Falling sign
We two have run up all the slopes
And picked the daisy's vine
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For all lands I've fallen
Falling sign, my dear, falling sign
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
Falling sign
Should old acquaintance be ot
And never brought to mind
Should old acquaintance be ot
And all inside
Fall inside my dear
Fall inside
We'll take a cup of kindness yet falling sun
