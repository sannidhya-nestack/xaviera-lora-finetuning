She floats into the night to his bedside
And tucks him in and says, "I love you"
Her warm love stops the cold from outside
She hugs him, gives him kisses too
She leaves him just as he sighed
And his angel doesn't have a wing
And his angel isn't from above
But his angel sure knows how to sing
A sweet lullaby for him
A sweet lullaby to him
Oh just singing a song for him
Just for him
She listens to her late into the night
About boys, people and life
Feels her pain, tells her it'll be alright
But in her eyes she still sees the fright
So she gives a hug to her daughter's delight
And her angel isn't dressed in white
And her angel can't always make it right
But her angel can make it all worthwhile
With big love hugs for her
With big love hugs just for her
Just holding on for a while
For a while
She comes to our room with little sound
Crawls under the sheets next to me
A greater love I would never have found
I've allowed my heart for only her to see
Then she shows a love that's just for me
And my angel I marvel every day
And my angel
Just appeared in front of me
But my angel
I'm sure glad she stayed
Oh her love just lets me be
Oh she just lets me be
Her love lets me be
Oh my angel
You're my angel, my angel, my angel
And our angel has lived with many fears
And our angel, she's just another woman
And our angel has shed a few tears
But her own angel
Appears once again to look out for her only as she can
To be there as she always has been
To be there as she always has been
To be there as she always has been
To be there as she always has been
