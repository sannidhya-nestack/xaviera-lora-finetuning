There's a place in West Virginia where the mountains pierced the sky
Now a wide open space gone forever
Where they cut down all the trees brought a mountain to its knees
And they poisoned the air and killed the river
Oh, they dug for the coal'til the mountains were no more
And those miners, they never saw the sun
Many a poor man lost his life in the tunnels of the mines
With that black dust heavy on his lungs
Oh, the cold company came and the cold company left
Now all that remains are the scars upon this earth
And the ghosts of the men who died in the mines
Haunt the dreams of those he left behind
And the last mountain crumbled to the ground
In that hunger for black gold
Seems the devil took control in his greed
All he left behind was nothing
And though wind blows different now
There's a lonesome mournful sound
For a land that is lost and otten
Oh, the coal company came and the coal company left
Now all that remains are the scars upon this earth
And the ghosts of the men who died in the mines
Haunt the dreams of those he left behind
And the last mountain crumbled to the ground
Oh, the coal company came and the coal company left
Now all that remains are the scars upon this earth
And the ghosts of the men who died in the mines
Haunt the dreams of those they left behind
And the last mountain crumble to the ground
And the last mountain crumble to the ground
The last mountain crumble to the ground
