Keep going don't stop now (ooh)
Don't stop doing what you do to me (don't stop)
Tell me what you fantasy (don't stop)
Love the way you handle me (don't stop)
Give me what you got in mind
Hey baby how you doing?
I'm Mr. Adams, can I buy you a drink?
She whispered, "What?"
She gave me a wink, she blew me a kiss
Started licking her lips and slowly swaying her hips
Now she gots my attention, believe that cuz
I never seen her ass like that
Did a mansion, she stacked like crates of wax
Dignified, sharper than a battle axe
Class act 5-5 with brown eyes
Been around the world, she prefers the sunrise
Truth is her ally, loves the foundation
She rallies to revolution, fighting for liberation
Displaying patience for ignorance and hatred
She ain't religious but her body parts are sacred
So thank God if you ever see her naked
And don't stop cause baby you gonna make it
Ooh girl I like your style
Your sexy ass profile
Lady you drive me wild
Keep going don't stop now
Don't stop doing what you do to me
Don't stop tell me what you're fantasy
Don't stop loving what you handle me
Don't stop give me what you got to show
On my way out the tunnel it was dark and eerie
Put my mind on you girl I'ma make you feel me
Fear control method break the chain
You got what it takes babe I can't complain
Just running back like Teevo
Really hate the freeload but freak not trick
Installed in me, you know
Neat mode got my stomach crampin'
New position need another fashion
Like two pit bulls no rules when we alone
Promising sunrise when we get it on
I'm premature no time
Go ahead and laugh, go ahead and bath
You released first, Quinn comin' in last
When in admiration destination is sleep
Motivation for the demonstration baby is me
In the club back of the car
In your new canopy
Turn you to sprung in your kitty in the Cassidy
Ooh girl, I like your style (I like your style)
Your sexy ass profile (profile)
Lady, you drive me wild (wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow)
Keep going, don't stop me now (don't stop me now)
Don't stop doing what you do to me (what you do to me)
Don't stop, tell me what your fantasy (what your fantasy)
Don't stop, love the way you handle me (handle me)
Baby I'm so excited, because I like what I see
And just to get a taste, I'll do whatever it takes
Cause I'm a slave for your body, I'll soothe your soul
Heal your mind, satisfy the sexual
I'll place you on a pedestal and never let you down
Traveling first class out of town
I used to get around, but I'm a changed man
Still sticking to the game plan you make me wanna break dance
Take a chance re-evaluate my statements about love
Cause you the woman I been dreaming of show love
Feeling high and I ain't take a puff
She plays tough and she works even harder
Than Jay Z when he was still Shawn Carter
So save your game boy don't even bother
She was raised by your father and she knows better
To never let her suck a sweater that's why I'm gonna get her
Ooh girl I like your style (I like your style)
