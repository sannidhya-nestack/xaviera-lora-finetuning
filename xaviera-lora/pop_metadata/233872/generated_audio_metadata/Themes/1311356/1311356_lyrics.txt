Every time I cast my line, you bite it (bite it, bite it, bite it, bite it)
As I'm about to let you go, you fight it (fight it, fight it, fight it)
Narcissistic baby, dreams of thunder
Every time I prove you wrong you wonder
I was unaware of the chaos (I was unaware of the chaos)
The chaos
I was unaware of the chaos (I was unaware of the chaos)
Thunder
Every time I cast my line
You bite it, you bite it
As I'm about to let you go
You fight it, you fight it
Every time I cast my line, you fight it, you bite it
As I'm about to let you go, you fight it, you fight it
Narcissistic baby, dreams of thunder
Every time I prove you wrong, you wonder
Another one I wanted
Another one, another one
Another one, I want it
Another one, another one
Another one, I want it
Another one, another one
Another one, I want it
Another one, another one
Another one, another one, I want it
Another one, another one, another one, I want it
Another one, another one
Another one, I want it
Another one, another one
Another one, I want it
Another one, another one
