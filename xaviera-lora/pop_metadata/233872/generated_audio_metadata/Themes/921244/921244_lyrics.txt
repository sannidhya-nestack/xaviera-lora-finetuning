Say you are
The coldest son of a bastard in this town
You are driving steel
And you're drunk at the wheel
Running all your friends into the crowd
Summers come
Your grain fields are all dust and seeds dried up
So you drive to the next town
Burn their silos down
Slaughter all their cattle and reduce to rust
Your house is such a lonely place
You've been called out
The whole city stands at your gate
They scream so loud
You're forced to draw your weapon
Make a stand when questioned
See the men
Pitchfork and burning state winter falls
The cold ice in the morning may never thaw
Still you're lying all over town
Spreading rumors all around
They'll eventually have
Come what may
The evening's black and your fire reduced to grey
Something on your mind
Is hoping that you'll find
The truth that's in you
The man that got away
Your house is such a lonely place
You've been
The whole city stands at your gate
They scream so loud
You're forced to draw your weapon
Make a stand when questioned
See the mess you've made
Bitchfork and burning state
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
