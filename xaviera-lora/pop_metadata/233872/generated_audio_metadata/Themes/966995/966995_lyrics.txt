It is more than a memory
A cascade of dreams I could reach back and see
I had you right next to me
You were so close I could feel your heartbeat
And the sun was coming up for air
We
Exhaled and the moment was there and that's where we are forever
That's where we are forever
That's where we are forever
We, we, we, we
All forever
We ot about the space between you and I and everything
At the moment it was just you and me
The weight of the world didn't feel so heavy these days
We're going to start going to sleep
We
Created a moment to keep
That's where we are forever
That's where we are forever
That's where we are forever
We, we, we, we all together now
