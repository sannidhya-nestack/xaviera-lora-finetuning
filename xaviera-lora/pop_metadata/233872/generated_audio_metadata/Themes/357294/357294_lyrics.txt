Love
Love
Overcomes all that
Oh love
It's the strongest force in the universe
A whole race, colour, family and friends
We fight for our rights but lose ourselves in the end
we ot that love
A wolf comes on a lance, oh, and now
He's the strongest force in the universe, universe
Love, love
Singing love, singing love, singing love
A king came in the name of love
A king that fought for the sake of love
Why can't we see their love?
They will never et
Overcomes all odds
Oh and love
Is the strongest force in the universe
A dying world waits with great expectation
For this generation
I wanna rise up
I wanna live life in light of love
Love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Overcomes all odds
Oh, love
You're the strongest force here in the universe
