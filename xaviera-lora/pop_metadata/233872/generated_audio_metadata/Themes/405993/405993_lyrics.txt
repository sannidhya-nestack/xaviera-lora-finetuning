Sometimes I need to walk away
Sometimes I need to cry
Sometimes I need a little space
Sometimes I don't know why
But if anything in my life's been right
Girl, it's you and me
I think of you and your smiling face
And how happy we will be
I will always love you
And I mean it from my heart
Can you see that you and me should never be apart
I will always love you
Please don't ever leave my side
Feels like heaven in your arms tonight
And these feelings I can't hide
God knows I should have shown you more
I know that I withdrew
God knows I should have told you more
But God knows this much is true
I will always love you and I mean it from my heart
Can you see that you and me should never be apart
I will always love you
Please don't ever leave my side
Feels like heaven in your arms tonight
And these feelings I can't hide
Now I'm asking you
Who will you share my life?
I will always cherish you
Tonight'til the end of time
And I will always love you and I mean it from my heart
Can you see that you and me should never be apart?
I will always love you
Please don't ever leave my side
Feels like heaven in your arms tonight
And these feelings I can't hide
