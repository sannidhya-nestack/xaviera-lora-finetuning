Bring that buzz back to me
Cause you're my sweetest honeybee
So bring that buzz back to me
Cause you're my sweetest honeybee
And I'll say whoa
Oh, oh, yes, yes, yes, just bring that buzz back to me
I felt a little sting that sweet day
But then you went and buzzed away
Oh, I felt a little sting of that sweet day
The dirty you and day buzzed away
And I said, "Whoa, whoa"
Yes, yes, yes, yes it brings that buzz back to me
Well, you've been buzzing all around my brain
I get so dizzy trying to follow your trail
I'll just bring some pretty flowers everywhere that I go
And hope you'll stop and say hello
there's that feeling that I love
When I'm feelin' your buzz
There's that feelin' that I love
When I'm feelin' your buzz
And I say, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yes, yes, yes, yes (Bring that buzz back to me)
you're my sweetest honeybee (Bring that buzz back to me)
And you can sting me anytime (Bring that buzz back to me)
I just wanna buzz around with you (Bring that buzz back to me)
