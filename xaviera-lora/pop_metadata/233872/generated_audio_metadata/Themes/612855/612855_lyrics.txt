Underneath the arches, I dream my dreams away (dreams away)
Underneath the arches, on the cobblestones I lie
Every night you'll find me, tired of that moan (of that moan)
Happy when the daylight comes creeping
Sleepy when it's raining
And sleepy when it's falling
You hear the trains rattling by, by, by
Pavement is my pillow
No matter where I stand
Underneath the arching
I dream my dreams away
When I'm strolling, just strolling by the light of the moon
I'm up, every night I go out strolling
And I know my, my luck is lowly
When I'm strolling with my old one, I'm alive
On Martha Kelly's doorstep, down Paradise Row
I sit along the Nelly
She'd sit along the Joan
She's got a hole in her frock
A hole in her shoe
And a hole in her sock
Where her toe beats through
But Nelly was the smartest in our alley
On Mother Kelly's doorstep
I'm wondering now
If little gal Nelly
Remembers Joe, her beau
And does she love me like she used to?
On Mother Kelly's doorstep down Paradise Road
