Don't want to look over my shoulder
On the occasions you and I walk free
Each day we get a little bolder
This bond between you and me
And they say the best time is the afternoon
But our time together is over too soon
When you are back at work on the sea of arrows
And I'm back here set in the shadows
Now there's been a time
No, I don't mind
All the things to find
And yes, I've been blind
But I've been cute
Turned off and too kind
Though guilty of
Not reading between the lines
I don't remember when I felt like this before
I want to be engulfed in your love forever more
Walking down your high road, jeans slinging
And I can't stop my lips from singing
Let's go, us kicking, God-wrenching
On that useless son of gun
'Cause one thing I know for sure
Is that clearly you are the one
Now there's been a time
No, I don't mind
All these things to find
And yes, I've been blind
But I've been cute and open to kind
Of not being between the lines
Now there's been a time
Now I don't mind
All the things to find
And yes I've been blind
But I've been good
And often to kind
Though guilty of
Not reading between the lines
Rise!
