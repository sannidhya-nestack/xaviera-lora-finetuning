We observe today not a victory of party, but a celebration of freedom, symbolizing an end, as well as a beginning, signifying renewal, as well as change.
For I have sworn before you and Almighty God
And the same Solomon are forebears prescribed Nearly a century and three quarters ago
The world is very different now For man holds in his mortal hand The power to abolish
All forms of human poverty and all forms of human life
And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought
Are still at issue around the globe
The belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity
We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom symbolizing an end
as well as a beginning, signifying renewal as well as change.
For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago.
The world is very different now, for man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty.
And all forms of human life
