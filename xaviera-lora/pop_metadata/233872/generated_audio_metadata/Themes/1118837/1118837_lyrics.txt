Something about you
Got me feeling so higher
I can't handle the fire
And I want you to know
I told you I like you
And you told me you like me
Can you stay by my side please?
Cause I'm dying to know
I can't wait you calling me
I know that you're falling for me, mm-mm
I can't wait you calling me
I know that you're falling for me
Calling me
I know that you're falling for me
Mmm, I can't wait you calling me
I know that you're falling for me
