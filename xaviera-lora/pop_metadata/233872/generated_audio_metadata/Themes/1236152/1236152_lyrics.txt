Stories of failures fill the pages of history
But we don't wanna take part in this race
The risk is to become a fate of memory
If you're not able to get out of the maze
We grew up in the middle of the street
And we can't take care of ourselves
We always sleep with one eye open
Ready to jump upon our feet
Through the temple of the faith
To the ashes of our hearts
We don't need a saving grace
Our pride is never ending
Crossing the bridges our fathers built for us
We hear the echoes of their endless labours
The loss of courage
It's something we have to stop
A new beginning is what we are waiting for
We grow up in the middle of the worst
Then we can pass through the wall
We always live for doing better
What's been done before
Through the temple of the faith
To the ashes of our hearts
We don't need a saving grace
Our blood is never ending
Seasons come and go
We've survived a thousand storms
We don't have no time to waste
Our blood is never ending
Through the temple of the faith
To the ashes of our hearts
We don't need a saving grace
Our pride is never ending
Seasons come and go
We've survived a thousand storms
We don't have no time to waste
Our pride is never ending
Our pride is never ending
Our plot is never ending
