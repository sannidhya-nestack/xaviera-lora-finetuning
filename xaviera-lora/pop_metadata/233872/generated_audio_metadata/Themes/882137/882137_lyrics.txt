There's a dance party all night and I've got mucho dinero
I bought these sunglasses while fueling up my Camaro
So let's take a ride, you can drive, I'll put the top down
Just give a little bit of
Of your goody good stuff
I know you got quite a lot
What you got has got me hot
Get down on the floor baby hot sauce
Shake a little more baby hot sauce
You're burning me up baby hot sauce
A little taste is all I want
Cause what you got has got me hot
Ooh you got me ooh you got me
When those luscious lips smiled at me I felt contagious
Every word I heard was poetry dripping from the pages
Ooh la la, voulez-vous?
Me and you could eat fruit together
Just give a little bit of
Of your goody good stuff
I know you got quite a lot
And what you got has got me high
Get down on the floor baby hot sauce
Shake a little more baby hot sauce
You're burning me up baby hot sauce
A little taste is all I want
Cause what you got has got me high
Gotta call the fire department'cause it's hot
My own mama getting hot (uh-huh)
And papa getting hot (uh-huh)
Stop, drop and roll baby, give it what you got (uh)
And our sister getting hot (uh-huh)
And brother getting hot (uh-huh)
Stop, drop and roll baby, give it what you got
Even grandma getting hot (uh-huh)
And grandpa getting hot (uh-huh)
Stop, drop and roll baby, give it what you got
What you got has got me high
Get down on the floor baby hot sauce
Shake a little more baby hot sauce
You're burning me up baby hot sauce
A little taste is all I want
Cause what you got has got me high
Get down on the floor baby hot sauce
Shake a little more baby hot sauce
You're burning me up baby hot sauce
A little taste is all I want
what you got has got me
Hot sauce, hot sauce, hot sauce, hot sauce, hot sauce
Hot sauce
Hot sauce
Hot sauce
Hot sauce
Hot sauce
Hot sauce
Hot sauce
