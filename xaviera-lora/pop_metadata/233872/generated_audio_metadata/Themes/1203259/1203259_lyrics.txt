It's time for us to walk away
From the things that break us down
We need to know what this life means at the end
I need to realize I'm not alone Though at times this life gets lonely
There is something bigger than all I can know
So when I look to the horizon
I wanna know where it ends
And when I see the rainbow in front of me
Is it a part of who I am?
All I want is a second chance
So I can see my baby grow
I hope with all my heart she'll be alright
But the future isn't clear
And I may never know
When I lose
To the horizon
I want to know where it ends
And when I see the rainbow in front of me
Is it a part of who I am?
Horizon, I want to know, I've got to know where it ends
And when I see the rainbow in front of me
I know it's a part of who I am
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, I know
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm a part of it all
