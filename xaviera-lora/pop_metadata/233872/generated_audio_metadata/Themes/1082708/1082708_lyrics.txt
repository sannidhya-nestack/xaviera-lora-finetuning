Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Friday's here, it's twelve fifteen
I think I'll take the rest of the day off
Oh yeah
I'm taking the short way home
To get there fast'cause I might not last
I need some soul food for this hungry heart
You must have been surprised when I opened that door
You spun around and dropped your apron on the floor
Ooh, I wanna make lunch with you
Light up a candle on a table for two
We'll warm it up until it gets hot
And get enough to hit the spot
Ooh, I wanna make love with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Stir it up until it steams
Then add your spice to this all natural recipe
I'm not in the mood for fast food
Let's marinate
Let's simmer it slow
There we go
Let's keep it in the kitchen while
All the other lovers are eating out again
Fire up the oven
Cause we'll be eating in
Ooh
I wanna make lunch with you
Light up a candle on the table for two
We'll warm it up'til it gets hot
And get enough to hit the spot
Ooh, I wanna make lunch with you
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We make it full of flavor
It's the kind that keeps you coming back
For more, oh
So later on let's rendezvous
And grab a little midnight snack
Por favor, I wanna make love with you
Light up a candle on a table for two
We'll warm it up until it gets hot
And get enough to hit the spot
Ooh, I wanna make love with you, yeah
I wanna make love with you
Light up a candle, bring it up to the roof
We'll watch those birds go flying by, as stars begin to multiply
Ooh, I wanna make love with you
Ooh, love with you, I wanna make
I wanna make it with you
I wanna make it with you
I wanna make it last with you
I wanna make it last with you
I wanna make it last with you
Ooh, I wanna make it, make it with, make it with you
