Ooh, welcome to my city
I've been praying more for my enemies as of late
It's ironic cause I only pray that the realest prevail
But as of late the difference is getting harder to tell
At least the ones plotting against me don't have to pretend
The rest switched when they saw the other side of the fence
Shades in the dark but the lights already got to they head
Slippery seen them slithering back to Eden again
Without the promise of God welcome to the city of sin
I'm laying next to her like I don't know she got a man
She told you that you over reacting she just a fan
She DM me her titties say she want'em autographed
She wouldn't name a single song if you asked, damn (I, I, I, I, I, I)
Welcome to my city
Don't let your dreams die in this godforsaken city
Welcome to my city
Welcome to my city
Welcome to my (yo)
I am
The niggas in my city don't get love unless they cashing
The women in my city don't get hugs unless they packing
The city where niggas fresh out the salon and still be capping
The life they claim to live only exists when they rapping
The people live for twitter action and to get back at they axes
Always playing the victim card they don't account for they actions
And at the same time they acting like they ain't affected
Talking bout the hippie raglo amare they pieces lacking
The city of activists who got standards they come in pairs
The city of one sided affection it's a dummy fair
Where dream chasers die broke but screw it man I'm still here
I wouldn't give it up for jack not in a thousand years
The people wanna leave the city cause it's toxic
But every time they leave Rossa leur rien me paye faux
The city where a gangster is not to be messed with
Marachi toi qui lit tout taulement ça j'accesso
Welcome to my (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Welcome to my (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Welcome to my (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Um, main problem, kya wane Allah khora? You know what? Like everybody has been hurt
So it's just a game eh Allah ya
