You don't have to give me anything
My treasure chest's already overflowing
It might not show up in my bank account
But I feel rich
Just for knowing you
And you're already showing me
All I really need
Your smile is priceless to me
It's like a tropical sea
And I wanna swim here for a while
Just soaking it all in
It feels like falling in love again
It's simple, it's magical, and I've never ever ever seen anything that even comes close
Your smile is priceless
Most people think that you're a mystery (you're a mystery)
But I know a thing or two about you (yes I know about you)
You inspire perfect strangers
So come close'cause you're contagious
And I wanna be down with you (down with you)
I don't wanna shop around no more
I've already found what I'm looking for
Your smile is priceless to me
It's like a tropical sea
And I wanna swim here for a while
Just soaking it all in
It feels like falling in love again
It's simple, it's magical
And I've never ever ever seen anything
That even comes close
Your smile
Is priceless
And if you ever find yourself in a dark and twisty place
And all the happiness has drained from your face
I'll do anything to bring you back to life
you'll smile
It's priceless to me
It's like a tropical sea
And I wanna swim here for a while
Just soaking it all in
Feels like falling in love
Your smile is priceless to me
It's like a tropical sea and I wanna swim here for a while
Just soaking it all in
It feels like falling in love again
It's simple, it's magical
And I've never ever ever seen anything
That even comes close
Your smile
It's priceless
