I try to live my days by spreading hope
But I see the failure of a utopian dream
Talk too much and we act too slowly
The time you think you have is running out
And we'll go through changes when the time is right
Hear the scream, hear the roar
Hear the echoes from a distant future
Change will overwhelm all mankind
There will be no mercy like a bloody river flood
Please obtain the sign
Please attend that cry
No destiny is written
We have to stop being blind
And we'll go through changes
When the time is right
Hear the scream, hear the roar
Hear the echoes from a distant future
Feel the cold, feel the breath
Follow the sound from a distant future
Hear the scream, hear the roar
Hear the warning from a distant future
Close your eyes, I'm feeling it
Take the courage and save this world right now
Here to the future
