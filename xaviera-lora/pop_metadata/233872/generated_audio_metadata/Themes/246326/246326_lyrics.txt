Since the day that our eyes came together
It seems our love has been written in time
And like a suit tailor made for each other
We're made to wear one another's design
So I'm asking you please to marry me
Will you join me in making this vow?
For as long as we live, we will ask God to give His blessings for our love to grow
I want you near me the rest of my life
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and health
Ooh, I want you near me the rest of my life
With God's love to guide us, will you be my wife?
So I'm asking you please to marry me
Will you join me in making this vow?
For as long as we live
We will ask God to give
His blessings for our love to grow
So I'm asking you, please, to marry me
Will you join me in making this vow?
For as long as we live
We will ask God to give
His blessings for our love to grow
His blessings for our love to grow
