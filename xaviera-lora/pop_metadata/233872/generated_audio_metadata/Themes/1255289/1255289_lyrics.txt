When you feel all is lost
When your past is haunted by ghosts
Her words are gentle and true
Across
Desolate plains
Through ice and flooding rains
Her hand reaches out for you
Her hand reaches out for you
You are the light in the darkest hour, you give me hope
You are the light in the darkest hour, you give me hope
There's nothing to fear if
You give it all
And if you still fall short
She will tend to your wounds
She will tend to your wounds
You are the light in the darkest hour, you give me hope
You are the light in the darkest hour, you give me hope
I've been battered, broken and bruised
I have broken every heart I can use
I've been battered, broken and bruised
I am bound upon my name
You are the light in the darkest hour
You give me hope
You are the light in the darkest hour
You give me hope
You are the light in the darkest hour, you give me hope
You are the light in the darkest hour, you give me hope
I'll be home soon
