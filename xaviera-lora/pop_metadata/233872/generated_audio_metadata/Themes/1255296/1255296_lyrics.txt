From across the seas he came to work
Sent the money back for his wife and child
It wasn't long before they came
To a strawberry farm in Redland Bay
Life was looking good, all the troubles left behind
But they have a funny way of finding you in time
Love day number nine
The war broke out, enemies were sought
He called the Isle of Aninformer
Took it, said and waved goodbye
To South Australia with all your kind
You're just a walk, so you must sympathize
Too bad you fought with us the last time
Long day number nine
Long day number nine
Four years gone and he would never be the same
Took each sunrise with a shot of shame
Four years gone and he would never be the same
They closed the camps down and they ot his name
Love day number nine
Love day number nine
Love day number nine
Love day number nine
Love day number nine
