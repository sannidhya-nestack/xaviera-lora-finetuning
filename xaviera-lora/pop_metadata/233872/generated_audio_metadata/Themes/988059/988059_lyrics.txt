Whoa, hey, sunshine, oh, hey, sunshine
When the sunshine is so bright
It feels so good so we rise
Up like the sun and we shine
Na na na na na na
Know how to have a good time
Go with the natural high
The secret of the good life
You can be somebody's sunshine
Somebody's sunshine
Somebody's sunshine
You can be
You can be somebody's sunshine
Somebody's sunshine
Somebody's sunshine
You can be
You can be somebody
I wanna brighten your day
Gonna give you something great
Because we're all just the same
Na na na, na na na
Cause everybody wanna be
Living so happy and free
Loving whomever we please
Well you can be somebody's sunshine
Somebody's sunshine
Somebody's sunshine
Well you can be
You can be somebody's sunshine
Somebody's sunshine
Somebody's sunshine
Well you can be
You can be somebody
Today I'm falling in love with everything just because I got a super sunshine buzz
Today I'm falling in love with everything just because when you got a super sunshine buzz
It can be somebody's sunshine, somebody's sunshine, somebody's sunshine
When you can be, you can be somebody's sunshine, somebody's sunshine, somebody's sunshine
When you can be, you can be somebody's, somebody's, somebody's, somebody's, somebody's, somebody's, somebody's, somebody's
Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine
