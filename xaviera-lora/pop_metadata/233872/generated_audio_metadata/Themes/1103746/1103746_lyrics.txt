I was a lonely girl
Floating round in a foreign world
Longing for something real, something true
Someone to hold on to
Then unexpectedly there you were
You found me
We shared our hearts in a tender way
Walking and talking the day away
Heaven stood still the day
I fell in love with you
You're the man I've waited for all my life
And every day you make me glad to be alive
This is the life that I've been dreaming of
You are my forever love
My how the time has flown
All the while our love has grown
Deeper with every dream
The plans we've laid
Friends who have come our way
And now on our wedding day
There's one thing that I must say
Through all the tears and laughter
And all the years hereafter
I'll be the one to walk with you forevermore
You're the man I've waited for all my life
And every day you make me glad to be alive
This is the life that I've been dreaming of
You are my forever love
Forever I will be here for you
Embracing who you are and all you do
Giving you the best that I can be
Forever I believe in you and me
You're the man I've waited for all my life
And everyday you make me glad to be alive
This is the life that I've been dreaming of
You are my forever love
I am yours forever love
