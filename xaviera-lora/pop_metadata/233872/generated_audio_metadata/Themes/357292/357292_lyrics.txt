My friend, I feel your pain
And the struggles that we face
Are different but somehow still the same
The trials tear us down
And spill our blood onto the ground
But we can't let it soak up
And I won't let it soak up
And life is what there is (what there is)
And life, here's what we have to live
You've sought for so very long
And now you find yourself
Amidst a world that's so wrong
You've been told you can't make a difference
And I know that you believe it
But I am here to say
That we can't stop the change
Life is what there is
And life is what we have to give
For one chance
To become all the things you've dreamed of
But be left alone to your own right
Can't you see you hold the keys to life
Save yourself, save yourself
Save each other, save each other
Save yourself, save yourself
Save each other
Save each other, save yourself, save yourself
Save each other, save each other
I know that I will never be forced out of here alone
Save yourselves, save yourselves, save each other
Come on, save each other
Save yourselves, save yourselves
Save each other, save each other
Life is what there is (what there is)
And life is what we have to give
