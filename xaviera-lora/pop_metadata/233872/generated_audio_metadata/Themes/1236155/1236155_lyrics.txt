You told me we'd meet again one day, someday
Those feelings wouldn't be the same again
I long to know everything
But now I close my eyes to see
What life goes on when hope is gone
Our hearts beat in all these memories
Throughout these years between joys and tears
You left the past behind, you're back
I never ot
I want to tell you everything
'Cause now I close my eyes and see
What life goes on when hope is gone
Our hearts beat in all these memories
Through all these years between joys and tears
In our cold surrender
We need to remember
In the end of time we'll meet again
What a life goes on when hope is gone
Our hearts beat in all these memories
Through all these years between joys and tears
Well, life goes on when hope is gone
Our hearts beat in all these memories
Through all these years
Between joys and tears
