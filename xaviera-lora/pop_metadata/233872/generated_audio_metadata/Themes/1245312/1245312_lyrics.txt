Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I just don't want us to ever fail
I just wanna be forever there
But I can't tell from all the attitude
When it should be nothing but gratitude
I just wanna find out what I mean to you
And I wanna show you just how I been needing you
When you be closing doors
You be starting wars
When I be the only one completing you
You giving me a song and dance, can I get a chance?
It's not like I'm making crazy plans to get in your bed
So I can get to know you, girl, I'm really, really for you
I fell for you from the very first time I saw you
Let me get them digits, girl, give me a chance to call you
Let me be your papa, you can be my olive oil
Something about you making me adore you
I will never put nobody else before you
I got a problem
I'm trying to find out if what I feel is real
What's the deal?
I got a problem
I'm trying to find out if all I feel is real
What's the deal? What's the deal?
Tell me mommy every time you pulling up
Tell me really how is that not really hooking up
I planned a whole lot of loving ready to cook like a oven
Look on your face tell me it's not really looking up
But that mini skirt is saying something different
Smell of your perfume is smelling so magnificent
Tell me baby why all you do is fuss
When I'm willing to put all the best on us
Why you wanna play yourself?
Why you wanna play with us?
Really don't know how to feel
Really don't know if it's real
All I know is when I look into your eyes
I lose myself baby
And that's a problem with me
I got a problem
I'm trying to find out if what I feel is real
What's the deal
I got a problem
I'm trying to find out if all I feel is real
What's the deal, what's the deal
