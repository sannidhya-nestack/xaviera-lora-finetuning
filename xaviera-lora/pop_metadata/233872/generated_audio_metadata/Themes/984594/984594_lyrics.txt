When I was young I liked to run around
But as I got older I wanted to get down
Folk dance, disco, ballroom dancing
We get to hold the girls when we go up rancing
Then the song changed from fast to slow
I get to move in and go toe to toe
I'm around a waist I could not miss
If I was lucky I'd get a kiss
I was a good boy
Always a friend
Mothers would trust me
To bring her home by ten
I was a Boy Scout
True and pure
But with fire inside
There is no cure
(whooshing)
It was hard to let go
And stop slowly swaying to and fro
Girls will be girls when died and sanded
And boys will be boys when left unattended
Hot dogs and Nikes, bag full of prize
That's when the men tell their little lies
About the one who almost met me
And then went with me
And then went with me
I was a good boy
Always a friend
Mothers would trust me
To bring her home by ten
I was a boy scout
True and pure
But the fire inside
There is no cure
When I was young I used to run around
But now that I'm older I got to get down
Folk dance, disco, ballroom dancing
I get to hold my girl when we go up ranting
Then the song change from fast to slow
I get to move in and go toe to toe
I'm around the waist I did not miss
I pull her in close and I got that kiss
I was a good boy
Always a friend
Mothers would trust me
To bring her home by ten
I was a boy scout
True and pure
But the fire inside
There is no cure
Boys will be boys when left unattended
And girls will be girls when the dance ended
Boys will be boys when left unattended
And girls will be girls when the dance ended
Boys will be boys when left unattended
And girls will be girls when the dance ended
There is no cure
There is no cure
There is no cure
There is no cure
