Catch a catch a you
Catch a catch a you
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Working at the fruit stand
I hear the bells from your bicycle
But I spin around too late
This perfect peach in my hand
Could never taste as sweet
As anything from your plate
The grace of your trajectory
Well it always gets the best of me
But I'd gladly give the best of me to you
And if you weren't always gone so fast
I'd tell you my plans
We would dip our toes in the fountains of Rome
Sipping champagne if I could catch you
We would fly so high we could watch the city lights from outer space
If I could catch you
Catch you, catch you
Catch a, catch a you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, I'd like to steal you
Far away for an afternoon
You'd et those other boys
I'd paddle your canoe
Write a love song just for you
Then you'll know
Those other boys just make noise
And then all we care to own is getting thrown in this old van
Our home is in each other's arms
Well I know you got a gypsy soul
Hey you're not alone
We would dip our toes in the fountains of Rome
Sipping champagne if I could catch you
We would fly so high we could watch the city lights from outer space
If I could catch you
Snoopin' round town like a private eye
Askin' everybody who, what, where, when, why you hiding, girl
You should be beside me, girl
I'd call you if you had a phone
I'd be your living chaperone
You could be my jelly roll
If I could catch you
We would dip our toes in the fountains of Rome
Sipping champagne if I could catch you
We would fly so high we could watch the city lights from outer space
If I could catch you
Catch a catch of you
Catchy catchy you, ooh, ooh
Catchy catchy you
Catchy catchy you, ooh, ooh
