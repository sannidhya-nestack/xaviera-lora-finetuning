Yeah, it's kinda rich, yeah
Mama told me I would never be shit
Daddy wouldn't even call back
It's a long road when you do it all alone
It gets kinda hard to look back
I've been taking drugs, I've been mixing it with drinks
Guess I had another relapse
I can't sleep when I do, I have dreams of a life that I never had
And I be sayin' ooh-ooh-ooh
I always feel like I'm trapped in a maze like ooh-ooh-ooh
Tired of feelin' like I'm stuck in one place like ooh-ooh-ooh
Forty days they quarantined LA like ooh-ooh-ooh
I just wanna get out of this place
Now let's put it in perspective
I don't wanna feel lost or jealous
I wear my heart on these Margielas
It's a cold world, better get an old face
Looking in the mirror, you just see an old face
Memories turn to melodies, oh days
Turn around, find out it's a closed case
And a closed casket
We're wondering why does this happen?
When the chief of police and the captain
Go out for drinks after causing harassment
This shit is unreal to me
Why don't you feel like me?
You know that you bleed like me
People are still in the streets
Still screaming fuck the police
Why fight back, no fight left? There's a far right and a far left
I'm stuck here, my chest hurt, praying to my God this blessing work
We need you now more than before, I pray that we don't have to take no more
Through all the struggle and all the pain, we'll come out stronger once again
Ooh, I always feel like I'm trapped in a maze like
Ooh, tired of feeling like I'm stuck in one place like
Ooh, I'm stuck in one place like
Forty days they quarantined LA like ooh
I just wanna get out of this place
