Let us bow our heads for hip-hop (hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop)
Kunshas X Mapa Gisha (Kunshas X Mapa Gisha)
Motality X
I guess they never know where the real hip hop is until conscious x came through and gave him a thing or two
Fat cats I only know a few the rest of them buff flow a monga by a konga ngalim jali bangulaga but
We ain't gotta have to lose the culture song nugung says face it
My words the ammunition and I ain't thinking of quitting
Nugabede selang nugung telang iba zisut geseng e flow
E haa de ngati buya de
Parties and bands we got some time
When I flow we ngati zopu manenye
Mbez ngoba baningi
Abafuna logo
Yanzagange
Maraba kedeze ngati flow
Unje upu alisi space
It's for the love
For the culture
For the skill and for that
So people see steam
Cherish the beauty of life
Even though it's always hard to survive
These are some writings for them all
And they ain't never gonna fall
You gonna hear them till you start listening
Even though we know it's boring as I say it's hard
Contra's X Mapa Gisha, Contra's X Mapa Gisha, Conta's the way he pop, naa, Conta's the way he pop, boy, boy, Contra's X Mapa Gisha, Contra's X Mapa Gisha, Conta's the way he pop, naa
Muta ndazo kwe hip hop ne
Muko si musi sama emsi zama kupawa wafezegi
Zamukukulimpilongo krigomara agwenzegi
Zamukulela makayanga kogonke okse mandeni le hip hopi
Kogonke enginako emzadeninzo
Kigelela no mindela inameva ngekolula
Nomandela nje ngobela azanga lashi taula
For whatever, back was never, one day namuzon kaula
Koke tingate walpek, mangi vela ben kapula vele dati
Yuzo repati likali kilongo gege ngi quiz
Kukuma gwamikshu tiksali nyongo rhymes de da spit
Zenzu bonu gufare poblongo lale la ki
This ain't a game boy you mutt anduktong
Kya gain awayi walele apale wama sangu gai
Fires in vele la matote abaten denge ice
Nong kenyazi zwelu gutu mapa gishu pleti spice
Ace in ice, eba fetu you beda record nine
Contra's X Mapa Geisha, Contra's X Mapa Geisha, Mutanda is the way he pop now, Mutanda is the way he pop boy, Contra's X Mapa Geisha, Conta's X Mapa Geisha, Mutanda is the way he pop now, Mutanda is the way he pop now
