I want to take you to California
Watch the sun disappear
Over endless deep blue oceans
In the half light I'll hold you near
I want to kiss you in Technicolor
Light the stars off yesterday
As the credits slowly roll I whisper in your ear
Yeah our hearts were lost somewhere back in time
Come and sing with me tonight
This love long lulled by
I wanna take you to California where the truth of fiction abides
In the stories we like to tell each other in the dead of night
Let's drive down to the canyon in the haze of the seventies
Strum my guitar and make it sing those cowboy songs so sweet
Yeah our hearts were lost somewhere back in time
Come and sing with me tonight
This love lullaby
Yeah our hearts were lost somewhere back in time
Come and sing with me tonight
This love lullaby
I wanna take you to California
I wanna take you to California
I wanna take you to California
I wanna take you to California
California, California day
California, California days
