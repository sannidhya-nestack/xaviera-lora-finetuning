Let's begin, let me in
It's a habit we're to break
We have had all we can take
Left the cave, left to save
On the morning of our birth
We are welcome to the earth
Eat to live, starve to give
And the regulars complain
We are ruining their game
Spreading thin
Home within
I'm allergic to the rest
I'm a danger in the nest
At least you've shown me where I'm not to go
Carry the timbre of your voice
Until they see the rain
At least you've shown me how the mountain grows
Out of the mission was your choice
You made it stop
Let me win, let me win
Give me answers I can see
Tell me where I've got to be
Awakened sin, where I've been
Out of service and I'm stuck
Is it finally enough?
At least you've shown me where I'm not to go
Carry the timbre of your voice until they see the rain
At least you've shown me how the mountain grows
Out of the mission was your choice, you made it so
