Oh, oh, oh, oh
So here I am, once again
You're asking why, and I don't have an answer for you
I just smile
Hold your hand
And say I love you
It's not enough
It never is
And that's okay
I don't blame you
What I take
And what I give
Will never balance out for you
Because I am broken, I can't be fixed
There's parts of me you'll never miss
I've been buried deep beneath
My heart I question, I can't stand on these feet
I want to keep you, you make me smile
Make me feel something I haven't felt for a while
But these currents from my past
Have me falling apart like broken glass
Glue me back together, the best that you can
Go ahead and hold me, try to understand
Because I am broken, I can't be fixed
There's parts of me you'll never miss
I've been buried
Deep beneath
My heart I question
I can't stand on these feet
Broken glass
Broken glass
Glue me back together
I'm like broken glass
Broken glass
Broken glass
Glue me back together
I'm like broken glass
Because I am broken
I can't be fixed
There's parts of me
You'll never miss
I've been buried
Deep beneath
My heart I question
I can't stand on these feet
