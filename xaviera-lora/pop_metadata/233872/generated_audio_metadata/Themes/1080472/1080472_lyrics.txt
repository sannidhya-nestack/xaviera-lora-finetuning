Me, in madness, trapped away from your home
Our hearts spoken to the new and the old
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
The matriarchal laws ruling all the time
Blinded with blood
Coming from between her thighs
Yeah, oh! (Oh, don't finish your song)
(Till we'll be sung full soon)
(So that it'll be heard the whole world about)
(I don't know what I'm doing)
I, I, I, I (I don't know what I'm doing)
(Make clear you're safe against shadow damage)
(The bandage)
(Whistle)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Me in madness
Tracked away from your home
Fork has spoken
To the new and the old
May the matrix of the world be cleansed of the world's machines
May the fat one be cleansed of the world's machines
May the high seated be cleansed of the world's machines
Crossed doors, left all the shots
Lying with blood coming from between her thighs
