I'll tell you a story, a child of mine
A long past I'll tell you, I was blind
I made some mistakes, yeah
I know you can see
Learn from my lessons
But don't follow me
In life you make your own price
Listen to your father's advice
If I could lead you down life's road
Don't walk in my footsteps, make your own
These words that I leave you will have to suffice
When I'm long gone, you'll have to think twice
In life you pay your own price
Listen to your father's advice
If I could do it all again
The ones I hurt I'll mend
Love unconditionally
Forever we'll be free, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
So this is my story, child of mine
Make your own choices and you'll be just fine
In life you pay your own price
Listen to your father's advice
So take now your father's advice
