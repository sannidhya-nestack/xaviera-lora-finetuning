Another year has flown
Look how far we've come
We could use this night to lose the pros and cons and chart our way
But I don't wanna be
So serious tonight
I have a lot of ideas of what we can do
So what do you say
Why don't we go out on the town
Why don't we dance real slow
Why don't we shoot
A little whiskey and sing along to the songs we know
We could even make some resolutions
While we hold each other tight
Make a toast and ring this new year in right
Tomorrow there is time
To ponder all we've done
We can second guess every choice we've made with a clearer view
But when I look ahead
Don't need a five year plan
I know that life is gonna be real good as long as I'm with you
So why don't we go out on the town
Why don't we dance real slow
Why don't we shoot a little whiskey and sing along to the songs we know
We could even make some resolutions
While we hold each other tight
Make a toast and ring this new year in a row
Should all of greatness be ot and never brought to mind
Should all of greatness be ot and never placed out
Why don't we go out on the town
Why don't we dance real slow
Why don't we shoot a little whiskey
And sing along to the songs we know
We could even make some resolutions
While we hold each other tight
Make a toasted ring this new year and right
Let's make a toasted ring this new year and right
