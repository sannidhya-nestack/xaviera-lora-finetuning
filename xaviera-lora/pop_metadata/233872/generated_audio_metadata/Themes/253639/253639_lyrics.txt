Yeah, it's Brick Adams, this is what I do, check it out
Sooner or later, it all falls down
I take advantage of the now, no more clamming around
It's my life, my music, my rights, my truest
Welcome to the new world, a new day
To find another way, your future is ready made
Stand strong, cause your roots run deep
Gain wisdom through the rhythm every time
When you feel your heart beat, you should listen to it
But the choice is yours, you can praise the lord
Or buy shit you can't afford, is it worth it?
I know ain't nothing perfect
But if you're searching for purpose
It's time to look beneath the surface
Dig deep to reach the benefits
Of hard work, remain alert
When you down in the dirt they say you don't stop
And it's crowded at the top I wouldn't know I'm humble and struggle
Just to book a show here I go again spreading the word
Rising up rising up from the lessons I learned
Strike while the iron's hot I waited my turn
Evolving like the modern man
Recruited and undisputed and getting with the program
Sooner or later it all falls down I'll take advantage of the now
No more clowning around, it's my life, my music, my rights
My truest message for the movement, somebody's gotta do it
Sooner or later things might turn up, have everything you want
But is it ever enough, it's your house, your car
Account, credit card for some life is easy but mines is hard
It's who I am, struggling, striving, surviving
Searching out like wise men, mercury rising
No time to waste in this infinite space
You need to find your place, it ain't easy
Can I speak freely, exercise my rights
Compose treaties, eat my weenies in the middle of the nights
I rededicate to taking flight
To reach the ultimate height, above the hype
To find a prototype, a good life
No strings attached, plant seeds, watch'em hash
Hope to lead'em in the right direction, happy at last
ive me for my past, I didn't learn that fast
But now I ain't afraid of mistakes I made
Sun is shining with a chance of rain
I can't complain I'm blessed
With music I'm obsessed
Hot off the press
Give it my best to be just like the rest
Sooner or later it all falls down
I take advantage of the now
No more clowning around
It's my life, my music, my rights
My truest message for the movement
Somebody's gotta do it
Sooner or later things might turn up
Have everything you want
But is it ever enough
It's your house, your car
Account, credit card
For some life is easy
But mines is hard
Living the lifestyle of rich and famous
That ain't my steez but I swear that this shit's contagious
Filling these pages with patience and dedication
My medication to heal the nation
Change the station to something sacred
Set up shop king size of ricotta
Farmers tender their crop or belly flop
Into a black hole
Those that lack soul
Get a stocking full of coal and remain anonymous
Making promises, to me and my metropolis
It's time to put a stop to this, I'm who the author is
Open minded arsonist, a true artist
Travel the parlors, roaming the globe
One change of clothes, I'm stuck to the code
Like Jack Sparrow, last dragon I ain't braggin'
Man I got the glow, I'm go for broke
Breathe deep and make a mental note
For hopeful rhymes I wrote, encouraging growth
Yo, sooner or later it all falls down
I'll take advantage of the now, no more clowning around
It's my life, my music, my rights
My truest message for the movement
Somebody's gotta do it
Sooner or later things might turn up
Have everything you want but is it ever enough?
It's your house, your car, account, credit card
For some life it's easy but mines is hard
Sooner or later, it all boils down
I take advantage of the now, no more clowning around
It's my life, my music, my rights, my truths
Message for the movement, somebody's gotta do it
Sooner or later, things might turn up
Have everything you want, but is it ever enough?
It's your house, your car, account, credit card
For some life is easy, but mine's a chore
