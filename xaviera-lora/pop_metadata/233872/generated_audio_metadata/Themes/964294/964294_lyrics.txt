It's a case between you and me (Now we're full of regret)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I thought you were one of the million
Short of a way to fall
And now we're here
Mmm, so amazing
Don't you get the rumor, we just stay there
Always have your back and never leave, yeah
Somebody will always be with you, yeah
Somebody may assure I go fit trust
Somebody may assure I never break one, yeah
Girl, I don't feel you, you play play
you my one and only (one and only)
When you there with me, you don't take
I place no one above you
I don't care what you never say
When it's not all that he's kept it's all you
For the love of you they give me
God this song is for you
Sure you said my love been long time
I got you know my love been long time
Sure you said my love been long time
I got you know my love been long time
Sure you said my love been long time
I got you know my love been long time
Sure you said my love been long time
I got you know my love been long time
Girl in the beat like say I don't mind ya
Your love got me inspired
Me and you together we be fire (we be fire)
You look good in any attire
Love say you bad body like the Kimber Natch
You coming in my life and you take my heart
You take my heart girl I don't want to buy
Girl I don't feel you see play play
Cause we my one and only (one and only)
When you there with me you don't take
I place no one above it
I don't care what you never say
But it's that Alex Camp that's on you
For the love of you that you've made
God it's all, it's all you
You sure you know me love it long time
I thought you know me love it long time
Sure you say me love you long time, I got you know me love you long time
Sure you say me love you long time, I got you know me love you long time
Sure you say me love you long time, I get you know me love you long time
We not sit on the talk, not the talk, no we joke
Story never reach the end or the growth
Baby girl this in a long time coming, love what you done showed
I been feeling like really mommy you low, I been hustling hustling
So I have to show you the whole world
Tell you nothing is better than both of us
Fly like the Eagles baby you are number 10 like Okocha
Other woman can't even come close to my roster
You so amazing
Know you get me on my way to stage yeah
Always have your back and never leave yeah
Somebody where girl is sleeping with me yeah
Somebody where I show I go fit trust
Somebody where I show I never break my heart
You were born in a million, you belong with the superstar
You care for me like I care for you
There for me just like I'm there for you
One for me nothing nobody could do
You care for me like I care for you
There for me just like I'm there for you
One for me nothing nobody could do
We usually play play
Cause we my one and only
When you there with me Dante
I place the one above you
I don't care what you never say
What is that I leave this canvas for you
For the love of you that you've made
