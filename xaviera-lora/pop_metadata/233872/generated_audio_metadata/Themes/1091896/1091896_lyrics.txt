That wants eat
Pieces
Pieces
I'm so
I'm so broken
Pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Never knew love that could do me like this before
Before
Sometimes I gotta
Dig deep inside
Don't reach above
I don't wanna lose your love
Sometimes I gotta
Dig deep inside
Wanna take you back to day one
I wish I would've gave you flowers
And start off saying you know I love you
Oh let me count the ways (oh let me count the ways)
I'll cherish you all my days (cherish you all my days)
And start off saying
I love you (you know I love you)
Oh let me count the ways (oh let me count the ways)
Cherish you all my days (cherish you all my days)
All my days
I'm so
I'm so broken
Pieces, pieces
Now I'm, now I'm hoping
Pieces, I'm falling to pieces
Never knew love that could do me like this before, before
Sometimes I get it
Dig deep inside
Don't reach above
I don't wanna lose your love
Sometimes I gotta
Dig deep inside
Wanna take it back to day one
I wish I would've gave you flowers
Instead of saying you know I love you
Don't let me count the ways
I cherish you all my days
Instead of saying
You know I love you (You know I love you)
Don't let me count the ways (Don't let me count the ways)
I'll cherish you all my days
You know I love you
You know I love you
Oh my dearest
I'm so
I'm so broken
