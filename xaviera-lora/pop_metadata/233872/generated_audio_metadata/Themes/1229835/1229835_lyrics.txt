You only call me when there's something you need
I was your friend, what were you to me?
Actions speak louder than words
And I should've seen the truth
Tell me when it's over
Tell me when it's over
Tell me when it's over when you're done being cruel
I'm down on my knees, I feel like a fool
Well how am I ever gonna love again?
How am I ever gonna trust again?
How am I gonna get back to who I've been?
Tell me when it's over
Tell me when it's over
So I can move on
Tell me when it's over
Tell me you're gone
I am wounded but I am strong
Tell me when it's over
Say goodbye
I'm not gonna let you hurt me anymore
Close the door and leave your keys
Oh, I'm begging you, please
I'm not gonna let you see me cry (cry)
How am I ever gonna love again?
How am I ever gonna breathe again?
How am I gonna get back to who I am?
How am I ever gonna love again?
How am I ever gonna breathe again?
How am I gonna get back?
How am I gonna get back?
Tell me when it's over
So I can go on
