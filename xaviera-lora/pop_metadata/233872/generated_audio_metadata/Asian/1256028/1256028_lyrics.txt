The dazzle of city lights, we're lost in the rhythm
The throb of the night, like a beat within them
Hand in hand, walking unseen distances
In silence there are no resistances
Let's ride the melody under these starry skies
In your eyes my universe lies
Singing our dreams away in this Korean enchantment
In this moment we're lost in enchantment
Through the white ruins your laughter is a symphony
In this bustling city we found our epiphany
With every step we're writing in a story
Filled with love with an unspoken glory
Let's dream under the same moon
Never miss a beat
With you every moment is sweet
In the core of the night our shadows entwine
In our K-Pop tune we let our light shine
So here's to us, to our love unfaltering
In the song our emotions are altering
Beneath the Korean pop verse
In synony's heartbeat
With you I'm complete in this musical street
Through the white noise your laughter is a symphony
In this bustling city we found our epiphany
With every step we're writing a story
Filled with love with an unspoken glory
Glossary enchanted
Endless dream, I can breathe
Better life unfolds for you
With a life endless I'll be
