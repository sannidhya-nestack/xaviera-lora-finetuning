Underneath this fading starlight
You and I shine the brightest tonight
Heart beating in a river of delight
Dreams fused in our eyes, oh what a sight
Let's dance together under the moonlight
Feel this rhythm hold on so tight
K-pop symphony, our hearts in flight
This is our moment, our time, our fight
Music flows just like the ocean
Our lives melody in slow motion
Your smile works just like a potion
On my heart, causing an explosion
Every beat, every line, every harmony
Draws us closer, this is our symphony
In the rhythm of love's sweetest decree
We're intertwined, setting our spirits free
Let's dance together under the moonlight
Feel the rhythm hold on so tight
K-pop symphony, arts in flight
This is our moment, our time, our fight
Underneath this fading starlight
Two hearts combine oh so right
In our K-pop symphony we ignite
A love story that will forever shine bright
Underneath this fading starlight
Two hearts combine oh so right
In our K-pop symphony we ignite
A song that will forever shine bright
Our music flows just like the ocean
Our life's melody in slow motion
Your smile works just like a potion
On my heart causing an explosion
