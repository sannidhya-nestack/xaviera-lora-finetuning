Under the neon lights, spreads our secrets in
Two hearts intertwined, just like they belong
In this bustling city, we find peace in the crowd
Music echoes through us strong and loud
Under the starlit sky, we sway with the night
I spark with the rhythm, the sights so bright
Through the harmonies, our hopes take flight
In our K-pop world, it feels so right
Our voices echo through
The soul city breeze
Difference don't matter we're at ease
From busy my own town
To tranquil Han River view
In this melody I find my truth in you
Under the moonswept glow we let go of the fright
In this melody together we ignite
As the city dreams we dance in the moonlight
In the heart of Seoul we ignite the night
Embrace the starlit sky
We sway with the night
Eyes lock with the rhythm of sight so bright
Through the harmonies our hopes take flight
In our K-pop world it feels so right
Her voices echo through the soul with the night
I spark with a rhythm the sights so bright
Through the harmonies our hopes take flight
In our K-pop world it feels so right
Voices echo through a soul city breeze
Difference don't matter we're at ease
From busy Mayondong to tranquil Han River view
In this melody I find my truth in you
Under the moons of glow we let go of the fright
In this melody together we ignite
As the city dreams we dance in the moonlight
In the heart of soul we ignite the night
