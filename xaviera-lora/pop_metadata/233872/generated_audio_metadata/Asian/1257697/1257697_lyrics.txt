In the midst ahead I've caught the noise, I've found my voice
In the heartbeats and the city here, I've found my peace
We are the dreamers in this game
In the K-pop flame
Under the Seoul skyline
We shine, we shine, we shine
Between the lines and the rhythm rhymes
There are times
When the echoes of our melody
Are our only company
We are the stars that light this stage
In our golden age
In the heart of this old city
We shine, we shine, we shine, we shine
Glow shine, we shine
Though the spotlight fades, our soul never waits
And the rhythm of the city's tied in the music we can fight
We are the apples in the rain
In the K-pop refrain
Under the Seoul city lights
We shine, we shine, we shine, we shine
We shine, we shine
