Living in a world that shines so bright
Underneath the neon lights, oh yeah
Chasing dreams in high heels shoes
Stepping to our own rhythm
Breaking the rules
Can't stop us, no, we're on a roll
Silhouettes against the soul, skylines glow
Hands up, hearts beating in tune
Underneath the endless starry moon
We're dancing with the city in our veins, oh yeah
Chasing the onlines we play the game
Stars align we're ready to fly
Beneath the soul sky we're alive, oh oh oh
Late nights holding to the sound
City's heart is our playground
On crowded streets we find our song
With every beat we feel we belong
We're dancing with the city in our veins, oh yeah
Chasing neon lights, we play the game
Stars align, we're ready to fight
Beneath the soul, sky blue alive, oh-oh-oh-oh
As the night comes to an end
We know we'll dance again under the soul sky so bright
We'll chase those neon lights, oh yeah
We're alive every night
Underneath the Seoul city lights
In the city of lights we shine so bright
Every heartbeat like a drum every night
Chasing dreams through the rush and the noise
Hear the echo of our own voice
The lights of the city they guide our way
Through the heartbeat of the night through the dance of the day
We're fearless, we're strong, we take flight
Through the rhythm of the city in the soft moonlight
Where the city sleeps, we come alive
Underneath the neon sky, we thrive
In a cityscape of dreams that gleam
We're part of the rhythm, part of the scene
The lights of the city, they guide our way
Through the heartbeat of the night, through the dance of the day
