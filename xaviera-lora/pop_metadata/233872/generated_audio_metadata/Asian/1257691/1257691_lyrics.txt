Watch me break in the dawn
Stars in my eyes, nights long gone
In some city under neon lights we roam
In this dream we are forever young
Our heartbeats drumming to the same rhythm
In a world full of color we find our vision
Sharing stories, our laughter soaring
This is our youth, our love story blooming
Through the echoes of the night, on the moonlight
Shining so bright, we dance, whisper secrets ignite
This is K-Pop, our dreams taking flight
Under the radio city skyline
We dream, sing, and intertwine
With the melody, lyrics, and the time
In this K-pop world we shine
We're stars in a universe so vast
Chasing love that's bound to last
In this music we found our path
K-pop it's our home and that's a fact
So here's all to our dreams in the night
In this K-pop tale we create our own light
With every lyric, every beat, every sight
We paint the sky in our own ways we delight
Through the echoes of the night and the moonlight, shining so bright, we dance
