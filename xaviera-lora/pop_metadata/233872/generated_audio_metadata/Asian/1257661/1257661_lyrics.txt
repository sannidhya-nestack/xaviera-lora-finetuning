The city lights they shine so bright as we're walking side by side
We're living fast just make it last as we dance into the night
Your smile's a gleam in my heart's dream as I fall into your eyes
Feeling like it's a paradise
Under this moonlit sky scrape a paradise
Lost in time as we lose our minds
Caught in the rhythm of heartbeat lines
Tonight we et the world outside just you and I
We're dancing, dancing in a city of dreams
With the neon skies lighting up our scene
Feel the beat letting move your feet
In this K-pop journey, feel the heat
We're soaring high beneath the sky
With the wind whispering our song
The stars align as your hands in mine
In this place where we belong
Your voice a gleam in the heart stream as I fall into your eyes
Feeling like it's a paradise under this moonlit skies
Under this moonlit skies
Lost in time as we lose our minds
Caught in the rhythm of heartbeat lines
Tonight we et the world outside just you and I
We're dancing, dancing in the city of dreams
Symphony on the sky, lighting up our scene
Feel the beat, let it move your feet in this K-pop journey
Feel the heat, we're soaring high beneath the sky
With the wind whispering our song
The stars align as your hands in mine
In this place where we belong
Your voice a melody, a sweet symphony
That keeps playing on rewind
With every look I'm hooked
Your love's one of a kind
We're writing our own fairy tale
In this city like a bell
With every step of every breath
We're beyond every tale
We're dancing, dancing in the city of lights
With the music smashing, sparking off the night
Feel the rhythm, let it set things right
In this K-pop world, we're taking flight
In the city of dreams, under the neon beams
Together we're dancing, dancing to the K-pop theme
