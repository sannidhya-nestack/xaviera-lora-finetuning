Who is it that's hitting the lights in this world we unite?
Chasing our dreams in the heart of the night
K-pop sounds taking over the air
Together we dance as if on a dare
We're caught in a melody lost in a song
Our hearts beating together with where we belong
Every note is an echo every word is a fly
In this K-pop universe we ignite
The rhythm wraps us and the beat sets us free
Underneath the stars you and me
Every move tells a story every word lights a spark
This is our music lifting us from the dark
This love we share it echoes in the night
With every beat we take flight
Through the music our hearts unite
In this K-Pop crescendo, love feels so right
Every step, every beat is a harmony rare
In this dance, in this music we share
And as the night fades, the dawn within sight
We're still lost in the magic of this K-Pop night
With every word, we color the city bright
This K-pop world, our hearts take flight
Under the same moon, under the pure light
This is our moment, this is our night
And as the city sleeps, our song takes flight
In this realm of dreams under the starlight
With K-Pop, our hearts beat together so bright
This is our world, shining so bright
