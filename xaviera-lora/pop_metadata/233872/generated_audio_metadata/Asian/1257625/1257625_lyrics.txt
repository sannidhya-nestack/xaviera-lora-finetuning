And as you're getting ready to keep dancing
From living in rhythm all the night, oh,'cause that's what I wanna be
Moonlight, love so bright, painting our story
In this moment feels so right, caught in your glory
We're soaring high, up in the midnight sky
In your arms I feel like I can fly
Through the galaxies, your love carries me
In this vibrant melody, resetting our spirits free
Under the neon glow, your laughter echoes
As we move slow, et the shadows
Bathe in the starlight, there's no trace of sorrow
With you every night feels like there's no tomorrow
Under the neon glow, your laughter echoes
As we move slow, et the shadows
Bathed in the starlight, there's no trace of sorrow
With you every night feels like there's no tomorrow
We dance through the night, making memories shine bright
With each bit of the night, our dreams take flight
Our hearts in sync with this perfect harmony
In our magical symphony we find our destiny
In the echoes of the night your love is my guiding light
In the silence your voice is the sound that feels bright
In this youth we're twirling fearless
With each rhythm we're fearless
In this dance of love scripted by the stars above
In the lyrics of the night we found our endless love
And the night fades away
I hear the whisper of the day
Oh with you my love I'd rather stay
As our dreaming notes play on replay
With the break of dawn let's meet the new day
Under the neon glow, your laughter echoes
As we move slow, et the shadows
Bathe in the starlight, there's no trace of sorrow
With you every night feels like there's no tomorrow
Under the neon glow, your laughter echoes
As we move slow, et the shadows
Bathe in the starlight, there's no trace of sorrow
With you every night feels like there's no tomorrow
