In a world when there seems to fade
You're the melody my heart always plays
See the stars in our galaxy
With you it feels just like a fantasy
Dreaming under the Seoul city lights
With you, every moment feels so right
Let's dance, let our hearts take flight
Beautiful like a starry night
Whisper secrets in the moonlight
Hold on to this feeling, oh so tight
In our dreams our hearts collide
With you I want to cross every tide
In this rhythm let's get lost
With you I'm ready to pay the cost
In the storm, you're my north star
Regardless of where we are
Neon skyline sparkles in your eyes
With you, I found my paradise
With our hearts beating in sync
