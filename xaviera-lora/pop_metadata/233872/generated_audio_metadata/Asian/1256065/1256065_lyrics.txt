Dancing under the summer sky
In some city, just you and I
Lost in the rhythm
In the neon light
Feeling the magic of this endless night
We're both dreamers under the stars skyline
Finding each other in the perfect time
In your eyes I see the stars that ignite
In the city of love you're my perfect sight
Strolling through the lantern lit paths
Sharing rust, creating our own aftermath
The twinkle in your eye matches the stars glow
In Soul City, our love continues to grow
We're both dreamers under the soul skyline
Finding each other in the perfect time
In your eyes I see the sparks that ignite
In the city of love you're my perfect sign
This love story is ours alone to uphold
In the heart of Seoul under the night's cold
Your arms my sanctuary my eternal delight
In the city of love we dance into the night
