Running through the city, lights so pretty
Can't get enough of this high beat
Turn up the music, we're gonna lose it
Tonight's the night we
Feel free, let's dance
Under the neon skyline with hands up
Reach for the starlight
Don't worry'bout tomorrow
et our sorrow
Tonight we're shooting for a new high
No barriers, no boundaries in this city
We're young while breaking free, and witty
Our dreams are alive as bright as the night
Dancing'til sunrise, no end in sight
No end in sight
Let's dance under the neon
Skyline with hands up
Reach for the starlight
Don't worry'bout tomorrow
et our sorrow
Tonight we're shooting for a new high
In this world of illusions, we're searching for the truth
Lose yourself in the rhythm, feel the beat cut loose
Through the city silhouette, we found a love that's real
With the sky as our canvas, let our hearts reveal
Let's dance, let's make this night divine
Under the skyline where dreams intertwine
Raise your hands, touch the moonlight
Our story painted in starlight
