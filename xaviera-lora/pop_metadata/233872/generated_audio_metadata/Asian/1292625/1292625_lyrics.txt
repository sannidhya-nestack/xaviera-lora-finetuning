Singlish, singlish, deb me co
Singlish, singlish, wandello
Singlish, singlish
Step out the house, weather so hot
The streets so clean, litter we got not
See the signboard, no jaywalk here
We follow rules, man, got nothing to fear
In this fine city, we all comply
Rules and fines, we take in stride
From chewing gum ban to ERP
We groove together in harmony
Throw rubbish, proper, don't play, play
CCTV watch us every day
Smoke in wrong place, keen to find sure
But we okay, la, keep air pure
Singlish, singlish, deafening cool
Singlish, singlish, wandello
Singlish, singlish
In Marti come fast always on time
Stand behind yellow line all in line
No durian on train smell too strong
We understand so we move along
In this fine city we all comply
Rules and fines we take in stride
From silent nights to bright city
We groove together
Happily
Some say strict, we say safe and sound
In our little red dot, peace all around
Order and law, that's how we be
Living life here, so carefree
In this fine city, we all comply
Rules and fines, we take in stride
From chewing gum ban to ERP
We groove together in harmony
Singlish, singlish, talk me ko
Singlish, singlish, wan me lo
Singlish, singlish, talk me ko
Singlish, singlish, wan me lo
Singlish, singlish, talk me ko
Singlish, singlish, wan me lo
Singlish, singlish
Singlish, singlish, talk me ko
Singlish, singlish, wan me lo
Singlish, singlish
