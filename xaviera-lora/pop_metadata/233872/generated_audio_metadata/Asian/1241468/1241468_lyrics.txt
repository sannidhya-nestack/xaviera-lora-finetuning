Our spirit flies (our spirit flies)
Our spirit flies (our spirit flies)
Our eyes close, tears cold embrace
In the winter dreams we chase (we chase)
Whisper soft hopes, our arise
In the frost, our spirit flies
Our spirit flies
Eyes closed, visions clear
In the silence we draw near (kakata ikanda)
Dreams take flight (often twine)
In the darkness we'll shine (in a midnight hour)
Dream of spring
(wome kum wonsama)
Dream of spring
오늘 또 온 건 so near
듯한 비 가까이 in our hearts
So 이상 여기의 every bloom
모든 개화 every song, 모든 노래
If you will dance along
우리가 함께 춤추자
Ice clouds, blisters, fade in the thaw
Serenade, 소리 없는 노래
Dreams awake, colors bright in the dawn
Our hearts ignite, your heart is on fire
Eyes wide, spirits rise in the sunshine of the skies
Sleeplessly
Dreams unfold, arms collide
In a world full of bodies
Dream of spring comes in
Dream of spring
For me who are so near
The time we got got in our hearts
So it's in the gear
Every bloom
모든 개화
Every song
모든 노래
If you will dance along
우리가 함께
