Lost in the rhythm of those old sleepy nights
Underneath the neon lights, it's feeling so bright
Caught in a dream, chasing after you and I
In the shimmering twilight, we fly so high
In this moving dance
In this K-Pop dance
We're together as one
Under the rising sun
Our hearts beat and sync to the rhythm
So let's dance
With the rise and fall of the moon
Our love has just begun
Sparkling stars on the canvas of the night
As we dance under their sight
Such a beautiful sight
Your smile that's brighter than the galaxy's light
I hold on to it tight
In this fleeting night
In this K-Pop world where our dreams unfurl
With every beat of our hearts making a fresh start
With a melody we're setting our spirits free
In this captivating tune on an un ettable afternoon
So his to us, embraced by the neon dust
In the city of dreams where love is amongst
This K-Pop ride, with you by my side
Until the break of dawn, our love can never hide
In this moving dance, in this K-Pop dance
We're together as one, under the rising sun
