I'll make it the only morning light Feeling the rhythm that's played all night
Lost in dreams yet awake in reality
Wondering if you and I can really be
We're dancing under the violet sky
Caught in the magic that can't lie
In this city of neon lights
Hold my hand, let's rewrite the nights
In crowded streets find a quiet serenity
A stolen moment that's our eternity
Under the moonlight that paints the sea
I keep wishing just you and me
We're tracing dreams on a starlit sky
In this melody we endlessly lie
In this world of bittersweet delights
Hold on tight, we're rewriting the nights
In the heartbeat of the city's rhythm
Our story unfolds without a dicta
In this symphony that never ends
Echoed in the nights that our love transcends
We're spinning tales in the twilight haze
In this song, our hearts ablaze
In this dance that in purple sights
We're painting dreams forever nice
As the dawn breaks, the music
