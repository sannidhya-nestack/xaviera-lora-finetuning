Tonight under the city lights our love illuminates
Dance with me lose control let's leave it all to fate
Your smile shines brighter it's you I celebrate
In this electric moment it's for you my heart pulsates
We're dancing under moonlight I'm singing the still light
Our hearts are synchronized echoing the night
Stars can't compare to you shine so bright
In the world of this music everything feels right
In the shadows your eyes a story they narrate
With every rhythm every beat we communicate
In the hush of the twilight, it's you I celebrate
In this K-pop obsession, it's our love we orchestrate
We're dancing under moonlight, lost in this delight
Our hearts are synchronized, echoing the night
Stars can't compare to you, shine so bright
In the world of this music everything feels right
We're dancing under moonlight while we stand in the still light
Our hearts are synchronized echoing the night
Stars can't compare to you, shine so bright
In the world of this music everything feels right
As the night fades today you're the lasting sight
In the quiet whispers of dawn it's you I recite
In this K-pop frenzy our hearts alight
Beyond the stars it's our love story we rewrite
We're dancing under moonlight
Lost in a still light
Our hearts are synchronic
Echoing through the night
