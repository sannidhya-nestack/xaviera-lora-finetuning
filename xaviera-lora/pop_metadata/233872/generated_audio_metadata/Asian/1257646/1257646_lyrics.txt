In a city that never sleeps out
Lonely dreams run deep
Our hearts like a drum
Skipping the beat
Secrets we quietly keep
Running through the crowded streets with dreams we chase
In this moment, in this place
Where the rhythm, where the bass
Feel the beat resonate
In this city so great
It's so real everything's fake
In this city of lights we skate
Heartbeats pulsing like a neon light
Every star within sight
Lost in the rhythm of the city night
Together we ignite
Chasing the melody, we sing the sun
Under the moon we run
This K-Pop feels like a home run
But we've just begun
In this city, dressed in sleep
Our secrets we will keep
Fueling dreams so deep
Our K-pop love will never deplete
Night and day we chase the beat
In this city of heat
With every rhythm and repeat
Our K-pop tune is so neat
In this city of neon lights and starry nights
We found our rhythm, we found our heights
A K-pop song that reignites our heart's aching flight
In this city doesn't sleep
Our secrets we will keep
Fueling dreams so deep
Our K-pop love will never deplete
In this city doesn't sleep
Our secrets we will keep
Fueling dreams so deep
Our K-Pop love will never deplete
In a city that never sleeps where love and dreams roam
