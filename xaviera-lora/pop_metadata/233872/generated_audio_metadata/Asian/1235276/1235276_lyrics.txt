Burning bright like a flame
What's stoppable is not a game
Walking with confidence
Turning heads in a world no one dares
Heartbeats racing, can't look away
We're the queens through the night and day
Fire crash, we own the scene
Slaying with selfies and clean
Eyes on us, hearts ablaze
In our presence time just delays
Every move, every glance
Commands attention we enhance
Our presence is like art
In our hands we hold the charm
If I try
Fire crash, we own the scene
Slaying with style, facing clean
Eyes on us, hearts ablaze
In my presence time just delays
