Choices in the air, what will you do?
Pathetic and super-duper
In the silence of the night, you'll hear the call
It's your time to rise, you won't fall
Destiny awaits, you won't fall
Destiny awaits in your hands
Future bright and got plans
No looking back just look ahead in your heart fire spread
It's up to you to make a change
In this life nothing's changed
Take the lead, carve your way
In this journey you'll have the say
Doubts may linger, fears may grow
But deep inside your dreams glow
Courage rises, a flame ignites
In your soul, the future rise
Stand tall against the tide
In your stride, a tempting high
Brave and bold, you pave your own
In this story, our chapter's told
It's up to you to make a change
In this life, nothing's changed
Take the lead, carve your way
In this journey, you'll have your say
In the echoes of the past
In the moments that last
You find the strength to see it through
In this tale it's up to you
It's up to you
It's up to you to make a change
In this life
It's up to you to make a change
In this life, nothing's changed
It's up to you
It's up to you to make a change
In this life
