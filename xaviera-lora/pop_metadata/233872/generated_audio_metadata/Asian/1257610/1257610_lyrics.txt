Trace of glances in my heart caught me in a trance
In this cluttered room eyes on you we sit by a chance
Diamond lights in your light spot it's you that stands
Feeling my heartbeat dancing to your rhythm don't need no band
Under the same stars no matter where we are
The rhythm of our hearts they're never too far
Turn it up let's dance tonight till we see the morning star
Burning love, mysteries unwrapped like jelly in a jar
In this Milky Way of dreams you're my shooting star
One look one touch there it is a cosmic memoir
Through the universe boundless and bizarre
Finding you amidst the constellations the brightest of the stars
We're under the same stars no matter where we are
The rhythm of our hearts, they're never too far
Turn it up, let's dance tonight till we see the morning star
Burning up, mysteries unwrapped like jelly in a jar
In the smoky way of dreams, you're my shooting star
One look, one touch, there it is, a cosmic memoir
Through the universe, boundless and bizarre
Finding you amidst the constellations, the brightest of the stars
We're under the same stars, no matter where we are
The rhythm of our hearts, they're never too far
Turn it up, let's dance the night'til we see the morning stars (morning stars)
Burning love, mysteries unwrapped like jelly in a jar
As the music fades away, echoes in my dreams
The rhythm of your laugh, a melody it seems
Underneath the stars, our K-pop love supreme
In this moment, it's only you and me in our love theme scheme
