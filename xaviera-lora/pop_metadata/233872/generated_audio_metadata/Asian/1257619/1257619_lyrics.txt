Waking up, city lights, got me mesmerized
Never stop, chasing dreams all through the night
In the air, sweet perfumes of neon life
Day by day we walk this endless fight
We're more than just the games we play
Underneath the soul city haze
We're dancing with the stars far away
Running through the nights and days
Holds the right on the melodies we sing
Stories hide in the silences between
Love and pride in every word that we don't mean
Each goodbye a heart or break unseen
In the lightstrap roll and serenade
Living this K-pop promenade
Dancing close but hearts kept at bay
Chasing dreams every night and day
Flashing lights, a rhythm
The lonely nights, lost in sights
Where will days fly?
We're more than just a tune away
Underneath the soul city fray
We're dancing with the distant stars
Running through the nights wherever we are
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Holds the light on
The moon may be with you, mm
In the light struggle and serenade
Living this K-pop promenade
When dancing close but hearts kept at bay
Chasing dreams every night and day, ooh
Nature guides the rhythm
The lonely nights lost in sights
Where love takes flight
Hmm, hmm
