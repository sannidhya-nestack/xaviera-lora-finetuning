Walking down the city by your unfettered mind
In your eyes I see the lost will be all found
Laughter fills the air, no need for any charm
In the glow of the moon
Your love is my sunshine
We're two souls dancing in this endless time
In the melody of the wind your name is my rhyme
You're my daylight dream in the midst of the night
In the canvas of love you'll cover everything bright
In this symphony of stars, you're my constant sight
In the rhythm of my heart, you feel so right
Through the noise of the world, I hear your silent call
In this tapestry of fate, you catch my every fall
Your voice is my anchor, the most soothing of all
In the map of my life
Your love is my sunshine
We're two souls dancing in the sun this time
In the melody of the wind your name is my line
Daylight dream in the midst of the night
In the canvas of love you color everything bright
When this symphony of stars you're my constant sight
In the rhythm of my heart you feel so right
In the streets, hearing it of love under the city light
In the harmony of our souls, I found my eternal night
