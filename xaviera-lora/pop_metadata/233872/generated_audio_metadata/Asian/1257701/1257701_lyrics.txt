Riding on the twilight following the stars
Our hearts are beating to the rhythm of our scars
In the glimpses of the city, silver and gold
We are young and free, we break the mold
We soar higher than the city scale
In the maze of our dreams there's no escape
Underneath the starry veil
We chase after the love that never fails
Walking on the shadow under the city's glow
In the echoes of the whispers and the winds that blow
In the midst of the crowd our eyes collide
In our hearts our secrets we confide
In the rhythm of the rain we find our solace
In the beauty of the night we find our palace
With the melody of our shared heartbeat
There's no challenge we cannot beat
We soar higher than the cityscape
In the maze of our dreams there's no escape
Underneath the starry veil
We chase after the love that never fails
As the dawn begins to break we say goodbye
In the city of dreams our love will never die
Though the distance separates our path
In our hearts we have made our mark
As the lawn begins to break, we say goodbye
