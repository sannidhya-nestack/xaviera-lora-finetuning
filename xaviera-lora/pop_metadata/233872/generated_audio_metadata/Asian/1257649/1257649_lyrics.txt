Heartbeats racing, lights are blinding
In the city, our dreams are unwinding
Underneath the moonless sky we dance just you and I lost in this trance
Riding on this velvet night stars twirling oh so bright
Let's keep this moment in a photograph in our hearts let's make it last
Feeling glances, smiles hoped
This melody has us shook
Cascading notes of our love song
In this rhythm we belong
Lost in your eyes, in your captivating sight
In this moment everything feels so right
Promise me you won't let go of my hand in this journey together we stand
One look, one smile, one touch
In this moment it means so much
Our hearts echo in the city's night
This is our ballad, our K-pop delight
Let's chase our dreams
