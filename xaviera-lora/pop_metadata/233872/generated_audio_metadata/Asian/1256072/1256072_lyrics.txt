Hand in hand we move, the rhythm as our guide
In a melody of love, together we'll abide
Stray fruit and chatter, the hum of life is near
In your sparkling gaze, every worry disappears
We dance to our beat in the citywide arena
Lost in the chorus of our own sweet serenade
We're dancing with the stars underneath a light so bright
In the heart of Seoul love takes flight
The melody of us echoing through the night
Dancing to our Korean pop feeling so right
As the sun fades out, and night turns into dawn
In the melody of love, a new day is born
In this city of dreams, where love's rhythm is found
In our melody of love, we'll forever be bound
