In the bed like a salty night eye, feel my heart lost in the line
Every step on these neon streets feels like a drum is beating in my chest
Memories in every corner cafe, where we laughed so freely everyday
Wish on stars across sun rivers glow, how could our young love ever grow old
Our melody plays in the Soul City night
Weaving through the bustling urban lights
Place our dreams on the dancing stars
Singing love songs for our hearts
Even if time keeps rushing
The days keeps changing
Our song remains unwavering
Our Soul City love song
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Sweet whispers shared in silent spaces
The beauty of your tender graces
Warmth of your hand guiding me through
In the city of dreams my dream was you
Stood under the Namsan tower skies
Teardrops falling from your eyes
A promise made
A love so brave
Held in our hearts forever to stay
Our melody plays in the soul city night
Weaving through the Boston and London lights
Place our dreams on the dancing stars
Singing love songs for our hearts
Even if time keeps rushing
The days keeps changing
Our song remains unwavering
Our soul city love song
Sweet words, no shade of silent spaces
The beauty of your tender graces
Warmth of your hand guided me through
In the city of dreams, my dream was you to fill it with
Life keeps moving, the world keeps spinning
Our story remains unwavering
Our soul city love song
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
From the glowing palaces to streets glistening with rain
And every beat of soul in joy and in pain
While love stories written in the city song
A melody forever strong
Our sweet soul love song
