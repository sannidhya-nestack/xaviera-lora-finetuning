Been here, been me on city lights
We're chasing dreams through the night
In a world that never sleeps, our love runs deep
Texts and calls, emojis and love, you're the one I'll never stop
Fluorescent hearts, you and I
Streaming love, no need to hide
In this digital age we thrive
Together our love will survive
Snapchat stories and Instagram feeds
Our love shared with all who see
TikTok dances, viral trends
With you my heart ascends
Floors and halls, you and I
Streaming love, no need to hide
In this digital age we thrive
Together our love will survive
Floors and halls, you and I
Streaming love, no need to hide
In this digital age we thrive
Together our love will survive
Shama, my love will survive
Shama, my love will survive
