In a field of dreams, where time stands still
Our hearts connect, a bond so real
Your eyes tell stories of love untold
In your embrace I feel the world
A gentle breeze carries our lover's tale
In this universe our love will never pale
Through valleys deep and mountains high
Our love transcends touching the sky
With every sunrise, a new beginning anew
My heart is whole as long as it's with you
Together we weave our fate so grand
Hand in hand, we'll build our promised land
In a field of dreams where time stands still
Our hearts connect, a bond so real
Your eyes tell stories of love untold
In your embrace I feel the world
Gentle breeze carries our lovers' tale
In this universe our love will never end
Our memories deep and mountains high
Our love transcends touching the sky
With every sunrise a new beginning renew
My heart is whole as long as it's with you
Together we weave our fate so grand
Hand in hand (hand in hand)
We'll build our promised land
With every sunrise, brand new beginning anew
My heart is whole as long as it's with you
Together we weave our fate so grand
Hand in hand, we'll build our promised land
Ooh, we'll build our promised land
