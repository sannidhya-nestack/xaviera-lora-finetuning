A midnight in cold city lights a glow
A cheating curse moving slow
Living our dreams under this theme
Silence echoes our unseen claims
Caught up in the rhythm of the night
Together we take flight
Yearning to hold on to this moment
Everything feels so right
Dancing under the neon lights
Feeling this all night
K-pop echoes in our hearts
Setting our world alight
Walking on the path of the stars
Memories inside our glass jars
In the rhythm of the heartbeats we find our avatar
Feeling the pulse of the night
Under the billboards bright
In the heart of the city we dance with keep up delight
Chasing dreams hand in hand in this mystic land
The rhythm of love is our song on the stage we belong
Living in the K-Pop dream under the moon's gleam
Caught in the rhythm of love soaring high above
As the dawn begins to break in the heart of the city we awake
With a song in our heart for our K-Pop love we make
Ooh, ooh, baby, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
K-pop love, the lake, mm-mm-mm-mm
Dancing under the neon, the lights filling
K-pop echoes in our hearts, lighting our world alight
As the dawn begins to break, in the heart of the city we await
With a song in our heart for our K-pop love we make
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (we made)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (we made)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm (we made)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (we made)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh, ooh (we made)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh, ooh (we made)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh, ooh (we made)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (we made)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (we made)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (we made)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (we made)
Ooh, ooh (we made)
Ooh, ooh (we made)
Ooh, ooh (we made)
Ooh, ooh (we made)
Ooh, ooh (we made)
What would you make?
