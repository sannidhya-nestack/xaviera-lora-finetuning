Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Underneath the lights in this bustling cityscape
Your laughter rings through our special escape
Through crowded streets we're side by side
In the symphony of the night we just glide
Whispering winds echo our love song
In your arms I know right where I belong
Lost in music every beat our own
This rhythm of love forever known
With the city's pulse our hearts beat too
Every moment spent feels like something new
Hand in hand we face life's strife
Together we conquer, we do by my side
Under neon lights in the sportsland cityscape
He left a ring through our special escape
Through crowded streets, we're side by side
In the symphony of the night, we just glide (we just glide)
Whispering winds echo our love song
In your arms, I know right where I belong
Lost in music, every beat alone (swinging closer)
Hearts beat too, every moment spent feels like something new
Hand in hand, we face life's strife
Together we conquer, with you by my side (I'm on the field)
With the city's pulse, our hearts beat too
Every moment spent feels like something new
Hand in hand, we face life's drive
Together we conquer, with you by my side
(Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
By my side
(Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
With the city's pulse, our hearts beat too
Every moment spent feels like something new
Hand in hand, we face life's strife
Together we conquer, with you by my side
With the city's pulse, our hearts beat too
Every moment spent feels like something new
Hand in hand, we face life's strife
Together we conquer, with you by my side
With the city's pulse, our hearts beat too
Every moment spent feels like something new
Hand in hand, we face life's strife
