언제든 이은 날 (언제든 이은 날)
제도 손에 (제도 손에)
Feeling the rhythm deep inside (Feeling the rhythm deep inside)
Hold my hand, let's fly away (Hold my hand, let's fly away)
It's just you and me tonight (It's just you and me tonight)
Springs that shine bright like the stars, let's make this moment ours
We'll write our own stories, living for these memories
We'll chase the dawn, less than that fades away
In your eyes I see the Milky Way
Every heartbeat seems to sweep a beat
In this paradise we find our retreat
Of the melody we'll never miss a note
Together forever, that's the promise we wrote
Every heartbeat syncs with the beat
In this paradise we find our retreat
Love's the melody, we'll never miss a note
Together forever, that's the promise we wrote
