Every time I see you gaze you're the only one
In this world you're my secret crush
In this dance of destiny we speak no words
In the melody of silence our hearts are hurt
You're the star in my darkest night
In this love story you're my light
We're dancing in the rhythm of the soft moonlight
In the lyrics of our love everything feels right
From the city lights we find our own beat
In this journey of love our souls meet
Your smile is a symphony so sweet and kind
In the music of my heart it's you I find
We're painting our dreams on the canvas of time
In the art of love our souls meet yarn
In the symphony of stars you're the brightest one
In the book of my life you're the best chapter I've begun
You're the star in my darkest night
In this love story you're my light
We're dancing in the rhythm of the soft moonlight
In the lyrics of our love everything feels right
In the ballet of our dreams, you lost my song
In the script of fate with you, I belong
Under the city lights we find our own beat
In this journey of love our souls meet
Your smile is a symphony so sweet and kind
In the music of my heart is who I find
We're painting our dreams on the canvas of time
In the art of love your touch feels like a rhyme
In the symphony of stars you're the brightest one
In the book of my life you're the best chapter begun
We're painting our dreams on the canvas of time
In the art of love your touch feels like a rhyme
In the symphony of stars you're the brightest one
In the book of my life you're the best chapter begun
You're the star in my darkest night
