Close to the neon lights, we shine so bright
Walking on this city street, feeling the night heat
Your eyes are like the stars, guiding me far
Into this labyrinth of dreams where nothing's what it seems
In this heartbeat, in this moment
We'll defy the stars, realign the comet
No language to show how deep we can go
Our rhythm, our time, we'll let the world know
Oh let's dance away'til the break of day
Underneath the moonlight where love's in plain sight
This is our K-Pop beat, moving our feet
With a love so sweet, makes the world retreat
Oh, the dazzle of the crowd
Music so loud
We keep on moving
Love's rhythm proven
In your smile is my sunrise
Ain't no disguise
In a world where chance can fade
Our melodies custom made
Oh, let's dance away
the break of day
Underneath the moonlight
We're loves in plain sight
This is our K-Pop beat
Moving our feet with a love so sweet
Makes the world retreat
Through the dazzle of the crowd
Music so loud
We keep on moving
Love's rhythm proven
In your smile is my sunrise
Ain't no disguise
In a world where trends can fade
Our melodies custom made
Oh let's dance away
the break of day
Underneath the moonlight
Love's got the stage light
This is our K-Pop beat
Shakin' the street
It's a love that's neat, makes the wife complete
So let the records play, our K-Pop serenade
In a world where lyrics color, loves in every color
With the beat that's tight, in the city night
In this K-Pop delight, we'll dance till the morning light
