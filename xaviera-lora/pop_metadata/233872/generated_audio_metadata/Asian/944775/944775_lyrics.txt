I know you're still here watching me
The man I thought once was the one
Some scars don't heal, don't fade easy
You know it really doesn't matter
I chose a life in pure solitude
You dreamed of playing a role in drama
The truth of words hurt indefinitely
The truth we were not meant to be
But I tried like nothing else matters
I feel you there smiling at me
No more pain, no regret, no sorrow
May you be a bird to fly high and free
It doesn't matter how we were
