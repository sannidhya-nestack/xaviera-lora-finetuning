In a world that's all so hazy
You're the one who keeps me crazy
Look at us, we're soaring high
Two hearts beneath the neon sky
Dancing through a sea of light
Lost with you in the soul city's night
K-pop beats that set the tone
In your arms I found a home
In the crowd, our love's a song
With your voice, I feel so strong
Our dreams like stars that brighten the way
In your gaze, I wish to stay
Underneath the K-pop vibes
Building memories that scribes
The melody of our shared dreams
Sweeter than it ever seems
Through the rhythm, through the ride
Our hearts beat in perfect time
Underneath the K-pop glow
We're dancing high and falling slow
In this city of dreams and stars
