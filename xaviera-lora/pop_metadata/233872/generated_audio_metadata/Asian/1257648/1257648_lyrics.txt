Underneath the city lights
Stumbling through the soul night
Every heart beat it feels so right
I know I'm alive
In this dream that paints the sky
Your eyes they tell no lie
Every moment you and I feeling so fine
We be glowing up high
Like the stars in the sky
Our passion will never die
In the K-Pop hype
Flowing colours breaking rules, I think I've no tools
Sing the rhythm of the night, we be cool, we unite
Walking through Disney on the streets, with your melody that eats
Every silence that it meets, you know you're on my mind
With the lyrics of your soul
In a world that's spinning bold
Every story that's unsaid in our rhymes is gold
We be glowing up high
Like the stars in the sky
K-pop love never says goodbye
In an endless rhythm we rely
Flowing shapes, crossing lines
In the sound we intertwine
In the rhythm of the night
We create, we design
In this K-pop colored night
Under the million city lights
Together we take flight
In the rhythm, in the sight
Our dreams are bulletproof
In this melody we goof
In the rhythm of the night
We're the truth, we're the proof
We be going up high
Like the stars in the sky
Our compassion will never die
In the K-pop vibe
Flowing colors, breaking rules
Life ain't got no tools
In the rhythm of the night
We be cool, we unite
We be going up high
Like the stars in the sky
Keep up love never says goodbye
In the endless heavenly light
Flowing straight, crossing lines, in the sound we intertwine in the rhythm of the night
