Yeah
Just like in a dream I see your face
Underneath city lights in a crowded space
Can't help but feel the rhythm beats fall into place
When I see you smile feels like I'm floating in space
Flashlights, magic nights, under the starry skies
We dance into morning light, catching the sunrise
This love feels so right, holds no disguise
With every beat of my heart, it's you I recognize
Whispers in the wind are calling us tonight
Hand in hand we run under the neon light
With each step we take the worth left behind
In this moment it's just you and I
Rhythm flows, heartbeat shows love in our eyes
Echoes and melody under the seamless skies
The beauty of our story written in city lights
the end of time it is you I recognize
As our song fills the air, night fades away
In your arms I wanna stay, eternally I say
Beneath the blazing sun or the sparkling moonlight
With you every moment feels just right
As our song fills the air, night fades away
In your arms I wanna stay, eternally I stay
Beneath the blazing sun or the sparkling moonlight
With you every moment feels just right
