Under the gleaming city lights
Feeling the power of the night light
Step by step, we take the stage
Together, ready to engage
Living fast in this dynamic life
Every moment sharper than a knife
Join the dance
Feel the beat with the rhythm our hearts discreet
Influent movements, emotions we portray
Swept away in this grand ballet
Lost in the cheers, cluttering the air
Caught in a moment beyond compare
We're lighting up the skyline tonight
In this adventure, take me
