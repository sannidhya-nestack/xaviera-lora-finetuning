차가운 비행기 Start a show (oh-oh-oh)
Feel the rhythm in your heart (oh-oh-oh)
We'll never get too far, just dance
Follow the beat that starts
Nights are long but dreams come true
My love is all for you
Whispers in the dark but the sky is true
Our forever will hold on to the new
Nights are long, but dreams come true
My heart beats all for you
Whispers in the dark, let them guide us through
Forever we'll hold on to the new
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Shine brighter than the stars, oh, oh
Feel the rhythm in your heart
Love will never be too far
Just dance, follow the beat that scars
Nights are long but dreams come true
My love is all for you
Whispers in the dark let them guide us through, oh, oh
Forever we'll hold on to the new
