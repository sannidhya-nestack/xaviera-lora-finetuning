Getting high on a Friday night underneath Seoul city lights
Living dreams in the neon glow with the rhythm in our souls to show
We're not just chasing stars, we're lighting up the dark
We are the sparks that never fade in this K-pop serenade
We are the beat, we are the sound, echoing round across the town
Let the melody set you free, this is our K-pop symphony
Dancing through the city's haze
Making memories in this maze
With every beat, with every line
This K-Pop life is our design
Living in the rhythm, in the sound
In every heartbeat that we found
We are the hope, we are the dream
This is the K-Pop theme
We are the beat, we are the sound in this K-pop battleground
Let the melody immerse, this is our K-pop universe
We are the beat, we are the sound echoing round across the town
Let the melody immerse, this is our Kpop universe
Dancing through the city's haze
Making memories in this maze
With every beat, with every line
This K-pop life is our design
Living in the rhythm, in the sound
In every heartbeat that we found
We are the hope, we are the dream
This is the K-pop theme
We are the beat, we are the sound
In this K-pop battleground
Let the melody emerge
This is our K-pop universe
Living in the rhythm, in the sound, in every heartbeat that we found
We are the hope, we are the dream, this is the K-Pop team
