(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
One step outside, the sun's so strong
Sweat until cannot tie him long
Lucky got shopping mall nearby
Go inside, aircon'til she'll die
In this hot hot place, we find our way
Chasing cool air everyday
From MRT to office space
We all together, aircon embrace
Meet my friends at Kobe's spot
But the weather really damn hot
Order iced tea or sit inside
Talk coxing song time to bite
In this hot hot place
We find our way
Chasing cool air everyday
From bus to mall
Any place
We all together aircon embrace
At night go home, aircon on
Set to coldest'til dawn come
Under blanket we feel right
Escape the heat, sleep tight tight
In this hot hot place we find our way
Chasing cool air everyday
From heartland shops to high rise place
We all together aircon embrace
Some say too cold, some say hot
But we happy with what we got
Island life under the sun
Aircon nation we are one
In this hot hot place
We find our way
Chasing cooler everyday
From MRT to office space
We all together aircon embrace
