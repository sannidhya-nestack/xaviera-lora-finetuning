Under the neon lights, I see your face
You shine just like a star in this crowded place
Heart's beating faster as we draw near
Whispering secrets only we can hear
In the cities and brids, we'll dance through the night
Lost in the rhythm until morning light
You and I, a story untold
Together we'll soar, big bulb
Dreaming of a world where only love exists
Under the moonlight sharing a kiss
Your eyes meet mine, and the world stands still
In this moment, we've got time to kill
We'll paint the town with colors so bright
Our love, an endless flight
Every step we take makes the future clear
Hand in hand we'll face our fears
Let's not wake up from this dream
Together we're the perfect team
Dreaming of a world where only love exists
Under the moonlight sharing a kiss
Your eyes meet mine
And the world stands still in this moment
We've got time to kill
We're the perfect team
Treating all the worlds where only love exists
Under the moonlight, sharing a kiss
Your eyes meet mine, and the world stands still
In this moment, we've got time to kill
We'll paint the world where the world we loved exists
Under the moonlight, sharing a kiss
Your eyes meet mine, and the world stands still
In this moment, we've got time to kill
We'll paint the town with colors so bright
