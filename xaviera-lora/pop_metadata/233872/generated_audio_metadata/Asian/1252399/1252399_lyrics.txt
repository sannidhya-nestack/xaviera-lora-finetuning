I see the storms in your eyes
They blur every night
Underneath the moons of light
We dance away our fears
We chase our dreams holding tight
Through the darkness you are my guide
With you I feel so alive
Our love will never fade
Together we conquer the endless skies
Hand in hand we rise
With every heartbeat side by side
In this world we will thrive
Stars in your eyes my guiding light
Forever with you we'll survive
Hearts united in the night
Our love an eternal fire
I see the stars in your eyes, shining brighter every night
Underneath the moons of light, we dance away our fears
We chase our dreams, hold them tight
Through the darkness you are my guide
With you I feel so alive
Our love will never fade
Together we conquer the endless skies
Hand in hand we rise
With every heartbeat, silence night
In this world we will rise
Stars in your eyes, my guiding light
Forever with you feels so right
Hearts united in the night
Our love, an eternal fight
La la, an eternal fight, hmm
