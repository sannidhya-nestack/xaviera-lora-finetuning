Feeling like a moonlight, I want to run in the light
Running through the city, I'm steady lost in the night
Trunk beats in the distance guide our hearts to light
Heartstrings playing our tune and everything feels right
Dance among the scarlet skies, hands held tight
Your laughter, songs and music shining bright
With every step we're taking this magical night
All I see is your love's perfect sight
I spot green in the twilight, hidden whiskers in the air
Lost in this rhythm, it's our love affair
In the reflection of the night, and your gaze so clear
It's in these moments, I wanna hold you near
Shadows and highlights, under the moons of our glow
The rhythm of our heartbeats, in love we grow
Through the music, through the night, amidst the city show
With every beat, our love continues to flow
Dancing on the solid skies, hands held tight, mm-hmm
Your laughter, songs and music shining bright, mm-hmm
With every step we take in this magical night
All I see is your love's perfect sight, mm-hmm
As dawn breaks with the city asleep in your arms
Secrets I'll always keep
In this rhythm, in this night, in the love we reap
With you it's a promise I'll forever keep
Dancing under starlit skies
Hands held tight, hands held tight
Your laughter sounds like music shining bright, ooh, ooh
With every step we're taking this magical night
All I see is your love's perfect sight
Oh love can take you slow but take you through
As dawn breaks with the city asleep
In your arms secrets I'll always keep
In this rhythm in this night in the love we reap
With you it's a promise I'll forever keep
