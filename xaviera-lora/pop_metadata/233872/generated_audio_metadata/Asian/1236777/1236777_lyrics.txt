Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
While love was a threat
Passion ignited and divided
Our hearts collided and astray
In this otherworldly display
Fiery words in the night
Embers of blood take flight
Lost in love so divine
Our worlds entwined they collide
All the worldly bonds we sever
Hearts ablaze now never together
In the cosmos of our lost decay
Emotional parts in distress
Like stars that fall from the sky
Elevated saying goodbye
One celestial now apart
In this otherworldly broken heart
I don't want me thoughts be severed
Hearts in place now never together
In the crossroads of our lost midday
Emotional parts in distress
이별의 감정이 우리를 감싸
서로를 잊을 수 없어
하늘 향한 나의 마음 그대를 찾고 싶은데
I'm the one they've both stood standing
In a world where love was dead
Fire, fire, we'll watch the lotus fade
Emotional parts in distress
