Lost in the rhythm in the heart of Seoul
Feeling like we're invincible, we're glooming like gold
Sparks ignite and passion takes control
Caught in the magic of the night, letting our story unfold
Between the flashing lights and the city's hall
We're dancing to the beat of our own drum
It's electric, kinetic, feels so right
Underneath the chorus of the starlit night
In the bush of the night we come alive
In the heart of the city where our dreams collide
We dance, we laugh, we're on cloud nine
In this moment your heart beats with mine
Feeling the energy we hit the ground running
Overwhelmed with the music hear the bass drumming
Through the city streets we're unstoppable
Living our dreams feels so incredible
Every beat of the night in the city lights sparks ignite and we're taking flight
Our hearts they soar on this electric ride
In the heart of Seoul we're swept with the tide
In the bush of the night we come alive
In the heart of the city where our dreams collide
We dance, we laugh, we're on cloud nine
In this moment your heart beats with mine
Fancy escape beneath the neon lights
We dance away into the endless nights
Living our dreams under the starry sky
