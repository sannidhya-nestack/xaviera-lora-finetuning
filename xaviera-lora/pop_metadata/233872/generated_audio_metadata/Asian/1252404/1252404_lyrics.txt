내 같은 빛봤던 소풍 (Softly)
Walking down the memory street
Your touch, the world feels complete
The fragrance of love in the air
In you I found my prayer
Cherry blossoms in your hair
Every moment with you there
With every step on your beat
We write our love story so near
In your arms I feel the heat
Heart to heart, we'll soar with peace
Through seasons, we'll never part
With you, a brand new start
Cherry blossoms and a tender heart
Together never apart
Cherry blossoms and a tender heart
Together never apart
In your arms I feel the heat
Heart to heart our song repeats
Through seasons we'll never part
With you a brand new start
The two people never apart
