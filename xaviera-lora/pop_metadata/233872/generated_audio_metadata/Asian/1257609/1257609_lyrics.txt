Under the twinkling city lights, we dance away the night
Passersby are envious of the spark between you and I
With the rhythm through our veins, we et all our pains
In this moment we're free, this is where we're meant to be
Can't help but sway as the music begins to play
You and I under the skyline in our own world'cause it's our time
Turn up the K-pop, let the beat drop
Heartbeats into the rhythm, we won't stop
Locked in your eyes, feeling so high
In our neon-lit heaven
Under the moonlit sky
Sweet whispers in the night
Everything feels so right
With your hand in mine
Together we shine so bright
In the crowd but it's just us two
Lost in the rhythm and you
With every beat every move
