Morning sunrise, we wake up loud
Take clothes out, one by one now
Hang them high on bamboo pole
Neighbors same, same, that's our goal
Colors in the sky, shirts and sheets fly
We all share this view, you and I
Laundry dancing in the breeze
In this moment feel at ease
Next door auntie smile and say
Good morning, ah so nice today
Kids run around play hide and seek
Under shadows clothes so sleek
Colors in the sky shirts and sheets fly
We all share this view you and I
Laundry dancing in the breeze
In this moment feel at ease
Simple things that make us smile
Sharing life in our own style
Neighbors, close community
Under same sky we all be
Colors in the sky, shirts and sheets fly
We all share this view, you and I
Laundry dancing in the breeze
In this moment feel at ease
