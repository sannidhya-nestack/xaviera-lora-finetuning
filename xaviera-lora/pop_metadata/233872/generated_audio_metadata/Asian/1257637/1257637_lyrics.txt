In a high pitched city where neon lights so pretty
Chasing dreams, feeling so witty
Turn the music louder, let tonight be brighter
Set free, don't let your heart be a fighter
Spin around under the moonlit skyline
Reach out, try to capture the starlight
et the past, let the rhythm cast
A spell of dreams, a moment that'll last
No walls, no chains in the world we see
Young, wild, unstoppable and free
Dreams awakening as dazzling as the break of day
Dancing under the skyline, let the music play
Spin around under the moonlit skyline
Reach out, try to capture the starlight
et the past, let the rhythm cast
A spell of dreams, a moment that'll last
Amidst the city's hustle
We find our rhythm, find our groove
Lost in the beat, feeling the movement
Making the move under the silhouette skyline
Love unfolds as the canvas of night
Our story holds
Spin around, let's light up this night
Under the skyline where dreams take flight
Hands up high in the moonlight
Our symphony echoing in the starlight
Spin around under the moonlit skyline
Reach out, try to capture the starlight
et the past, let the rhythm cast
A spell of dreams, a moment that'll last
Spin around under the moonlit skyline
Reach out, try to capture the starlight
et the past, let the rhythm cast
A spell of dreams, a moment that'll last
