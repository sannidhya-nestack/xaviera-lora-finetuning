In the realm of content and light
Where pixels dance through the night
We navigate this digital sea
Lost in the depths of ether
Bricks of data, streams of story
Cause our worlds where we are bound
I'm getting cyber-amazed
You want me in this digital craze
Cyberspace, a world unseen
Where reality and dreams manada
In the cold of spring's fall
We find our hidden place
Through the network we anchor
In this glass-tung world we intersect
Lines of each ensue, echoes of singa
This endless web we are caught
Cyberspace, a world unseen
Where reality and dreams none other
In the realm of culture and light
Where pixels dance through the night
We navigate this digital sea
Lost in the depths of Giser
Bites of data, streams of Sony
Cause our world's where we are bound
Again, a cyber maze
Your money in this digital craze
Cyberspace, a world unseen (a world unseen)
Where reality and dreams no matter
In the glow of the screen's bomb
We find our hidden place
Through the network we un-yawn
In this glass-bound world we intersect
Like the reaching through echoes of singa
This endless web we are carved
We find our hidden place
Cyberspace
