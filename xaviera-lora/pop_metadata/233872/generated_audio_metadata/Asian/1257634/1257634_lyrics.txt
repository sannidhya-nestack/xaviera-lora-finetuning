Caught in the city lights, we dance tonight
A melody in the words, a story that sparks
Your eyes they tell a tale, our love unveiled
In the rhythm of the night, feeling so right
Beneath the moon's halo, we move in the shadow
To the beat of destiny, our K-pop melody
In this dance we sway, to the break of day
Under the starry canopy, it feels like fantasy
In the sea of the crowd, music loud
We paint a story in shades of glory
Your laughter is my tune
Morning to noon, in a dance that's never done, we've only just begun
In the dance we sway,'til the break of day
In the K-Pop rhythm, we write our anthem
This dance is our poetry, in the city's symphony
Our love of story, in the K-Pop journey
In every beat, in every stroke, we dance, we sing, in love we soak, a K-pop tale in the city night, in this dance we hold each other tight
In the heartbeat of the city
It's a little pity, this dance is
