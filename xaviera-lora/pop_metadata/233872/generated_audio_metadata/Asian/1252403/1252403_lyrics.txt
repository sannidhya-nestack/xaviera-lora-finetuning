So I'll click out gently on the window pane
And reflect especially
Memories of us wrapped in a warm embrace
Your smile, your touch, I can never replace
With each breath, your scent lingers in the air
A love so pure, so rare
I will travel'cross the universe and back
Just to feel your heartbeat, my guiding track
Even in the darkest nights, you are my light
With you by my side, everything's alright
Soon the speech of thousand words, can ask my soul to start
The wind is cold but my heart is warm
Held by you I feel no storm
We watch the world turn to white
Lost in each other we ignite
Selfless for writing our fate
Forever in love it's never too late
Your snowflakes fall riding on my feet
Forever in love, it's never too late
Soon it'll be two thousand words, and ours will soon start
The winter's cold but my heart is warm
Held by you I feel no storm
We watch the world turn to white
Lost in each other we ignite
Selfless for writing our fate
Forever in love it's never too late
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now I start to hide too wide
Lost in each other we
