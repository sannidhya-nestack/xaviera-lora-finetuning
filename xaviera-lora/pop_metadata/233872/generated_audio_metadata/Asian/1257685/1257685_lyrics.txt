Dancing under the silvery lights of a life under
In a world that's been in class, no time to ponder
Hold my hand, let's take a chance in this moment
Surrender to the dance, feel the pulse
Feel the heart, riding the rhythm, making a start
Falling faster as the music plays
Lost in your eyes, breathtaking haze
This is our song, there's a neon ray
In the rush of the night, et the strain
Shining brighter than the stars in the sky
This is a K-Pop love that'll never die
Following the sound, chasing the dream
In the glow of the moon we gleam
Harmonies weaving, no words to say
In the rhythm, just sway, let the music take control
Surrender your heart, give me your soul
