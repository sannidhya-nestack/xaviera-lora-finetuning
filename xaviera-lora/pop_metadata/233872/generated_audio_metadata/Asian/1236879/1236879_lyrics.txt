In the night, under the moons of gold
Heavenly bodies move so slow
Silhouettes swing in perfect rhyme
Lost in the moment, frozen in time
Skin like silk, under gentle touch
Electric sparks, we crave so much
Bodies entwined, a cosmic dance
In this moment, we take a chance
Heavenly bodies, a dance of pure fire
Passion ablaze, our deepest desire
Mistakes in the dark, a cosmic melody
Lost in each other, wild and free
Eyes locked in a silent vow
Eyes locked in a silent bath
Everybody's here and now
Breathless whispers in the night
Explore galaxies shining bright
Heartbeat as one, a cosmic drum
In this embrace we become one
Sensual touch like shooting stars
Heavenly bodies near and far
Lost in the moment, frozen in time
In this embrace we become one
Sensual touch like shooting stars
Heavenly bodies near and far
But high tempo and trap beat
별이 빛나는 밤 우리의 맘은 하나 우주의 비밀 우리만 아는 달콤한 말
전설처럼 우리들은 하늘을 향해 노래해
이 순간이 영원히 계속되길 바랍니다
Soon everybody is a dance of pure fire
Passionate blaze our righteous desire
Whispers in the dark a cosmic melody
We'll spin each other wildly free
