In the heart of Seoul when night meets day
We find ourselves dead zones swept away
Sound of the music lights strip the chase
Caught up in rhythm and a breathless pace
Painted in neon, our hearts beat as one
Under the city lights a new story begun
No need for words as the melody soars
In the soundscape of love, the city it doors
Every heartbeat sinking to the beat in a vibrant city's pulse
Love is sweet wandering through these beautiful streets
In this K-pop rhythm the world retreats
Bodies moving hearts intertwining
In this city of dreams where stars are lining
In the dance of soul, our destinies meeting
Underneath the neon lights, our hearts are beating
Promise to hold as the lights fade
In the symphony of love, our K-Pop charade
