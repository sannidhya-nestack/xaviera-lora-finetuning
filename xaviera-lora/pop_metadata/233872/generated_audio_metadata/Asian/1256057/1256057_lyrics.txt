Underneath the moonlight, cities leap a wheel away
Walking side by side, in shared dreams we partake
Floating on the mellow, like petals on a stream
In the rhythm of the night, we weave our little dream
In the heart of Seoul where our two worlds collide
Dancing to a song on this love filled riverside
The script we write
So tender and pristine
In our Korean pop story
Love is the unseen
Burnt in city skyline
Mirrors in your gaze
Each moment a lyric, in melody we blaze
The play of shadows in the soft light's disguise
Penning our love story under the starlit skies, oh
Caught in the rhythm where love's the only decree
Swaying in soul's heartbeat, as free as we can be
In this Korean pop ballet, we've chosen the theme
Two hearts dance together, in love's enchanting dream
Caught in the rhythm, where love's the only decree
Swaying in soul's heartbeat, as free as we can be
In this Korean pop ballad, we've chosen the beat
Two hearts dance together, in love's enchanting dream
On the edge of the dawn, in this melody we roam
In every lyric and note
We found a unique home
As we follow the rhythm
And our hearts are ringing
We'll dance forever
Lost in our Korean
