And I'm heartless, I'm undead, don't need proof
Our love story starts with a sacred vow
On the bustling streets amidst the crowds flow
Our emotions beat fast, our love begins to grow
Dancing with the stars under the midnight skies
With dimly lit looks and soft goodbyes
Our hearts beat in sync, love's sweet surprise
In this beautiful chaos our love lies
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Tween the city lights and whisperin' trees
The rhythm of our love is like a summer's breeze
Even in the noise we find our peace
Like a melody in a Korean pop masterpiece
Underneath the starlight and whisperin' trees
The rhythm of our love is like a summer's freeze
Even in the noise we find our peace
Like a melody in a Korean pop masterpiece
Underneath the starlight, our hands intertwine
Creating a harmony that is truly divine
In the rhythm of the night, we begin to realize
Our Korean pop-up story moves like the sun, we'll always find
Underneath the starlight
Our hands intertwine
In the echoes of the cry
And on this busy street
Just like the chorus of our favorite Korean pop beat
Our love story continues making our journey complete
