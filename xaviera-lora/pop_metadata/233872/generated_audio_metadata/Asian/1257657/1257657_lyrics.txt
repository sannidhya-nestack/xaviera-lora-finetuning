Dance through the night on the city lights
Lost in the rhythm feeling so right
Heartbeat syncing with the electro pop beat
Street art colors beneath our feet
Singing oh, oh we're unstoppable
With the stars as I drive no trouble
Living our dreams in this K-pop night
Burning like the neon glowing so bright
In the concrete jungle finding our own way
Songs in our heart chasing the day
In the mirror of the night we see
The magic of the music setting us free
Singing oh, oh we're invincible
Underneath the moonlight it's magical
Feeling the vibes in this K-pop world
Like a flag of passion it's unfurled
With the rhythms pulsing we dance
Caught in the music in a trance
In the whispers of the K-pop tune
We're dreaming under the same moon
Singing oh, oh, we're unstoppable
In the K-pop symphony, it's drivable
Living our dreams in this K-pop night
Burning like the neon, glowing so bright
In the concrete jungle finding our own way
Songs in our hearts chasing the day
In the mirror of the night we see
The magic of the music setting us free
In the concrete jungle finding our own way
In the K-pop symphony it's incredible
In the dance of the night we find our way
Believing in the melody
Losing the grace
The sun peaks over the skyline
We hold on to the dream feeling so fine
In the heart of the music we soar
Kick off rhythm forever we adore
