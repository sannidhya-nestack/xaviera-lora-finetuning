Evers up on this road, tells a story untold
Riding high in this city of lights
With dreams in our hearts, and stars in our eyes
Let's keep dancing'til the sunrise
Through the rhythm and beat, feeling the city's heat
In this world where dreams come alive
It's the K-Pop sparkle in the heart of the dark
And tonight, we're gonna shine so bright
In the glow of the night, under the neon lights
Chasing dreams in a city that never sleeps
We've got the world at our feet, with a rhythm so sweet
Move into that K-Pop beat
Through the rhythm and beat, feeling the city's heat
In this world where dreams come alive
It's the K-Pop sparkle in the heart of the dark
And tonight, we're gonna shine so bright
Living the K-Pop dream under the neon beam tonight
