Oh, walking in the neon lights, stars in our eyes tonight
With dreams bigger than the city skyline
We get lost on the streets, reality and dreams
They intertwine, feels like we're flying
But as we dance through the crowd, music's playing loud
I see you in a brand new light
All that's wrong feels so right
Under these city lights
I never wanna say goodnight
We're dancing in the afterglow
Letting all our worries go
We light up the night, it's our time to shine
Living out these K-pop dreams, everything's not what it seems
But tonight, you and I, we're doing fine
Life's a beat that won't slow down, chasing fame in a new town
We're making memories under moonlight
Streets of gold, skies of blue, all I see is me and you
With every step we're making the night come alive
We're dancing in the afterglow
That ain't all I want
