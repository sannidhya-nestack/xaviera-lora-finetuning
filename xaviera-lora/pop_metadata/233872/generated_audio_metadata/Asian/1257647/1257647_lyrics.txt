Underneath the candy sky
Colors burst and fly
Caught within the thrill
For dreams don't need a reason why
Our footsteps echo on
In this city song
This K-Pop beat in our hearts where we belong
We light up the night, put the melody in our veins
Chasing the rhythm, breaking the chains, this stage is our universe
Under the pouring rain, this K-pop song in our hearts forever remains
Silhouettes in neon lights
Star crossed in the night
In sync with the rhythm we're taking those high flights
Across the mirrored skyline
Our notes to align
To this cosmic rhythm our hearts do resign
Blazing like comets
We light up the scene and the twilights glow in our K-Pop dream
Beyond every limit where we've never been
In this dance of life we're the unforeseen
Where the music fades and the whispers of the dawn
We keep this K-Pop magic even when it's gone
We light up the night, put the melody in our veins
Chasing the rhythm, breaking the chains, the stages
