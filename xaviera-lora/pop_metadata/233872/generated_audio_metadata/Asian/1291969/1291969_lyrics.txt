Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
At morning time here upstairs, som-som sound (som sound)
Kids run around, why? Like they go in town
Downstairs auntie, too tight she's so steady
Neighbors wave hi, all so friendly
Living in HDB, life so shook one
Upstairs, downstairs we all like wonton
Laughter and gossip everywhere we be
It's our compound spirit, you agree?
Lift door open always got people inside
Uncle talk loud loud his story so wide
Corridor got bicycle plant and shoe
We just smile say Ken Law it's cool
Livin' in HDB, life's so shock one
Upstairs, downstairs, we are all like one time
Laughter and gossip everywhere we be
This our kampong spirit, you agree
Weekend come barbecue at Void deck there
Smells so nice make everyone stop and stare
Neighbors come down bring food to share
And RHDB got community care
Living in HDB, life's so shock one
Upstairs, downstairs, we are all like one time
Laughter and gossip everywhere we be
This our kampong spirit, you agree?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Sometimes noisy, sometimes quietly
But together we live in harmony
Stacked up high, touching the sky
We share the space, you and I
Livin' in HDB life's so shop one
Upstairs downstairs we all are like wonton
Laughter and gossip everywhere we be
This our kampong spirit you agree
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
