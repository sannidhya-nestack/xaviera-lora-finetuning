On the streets of Seoul tonight
Under the glowing city light
Patterns of our dreams weave the night
It's K-pop magic, feel the might
We're dancing on the rhythm track
With love there is no turning back
In the spotlight we make a vow
The moment of our dreams is now
Through the music we soar
Finding what we're searching for
In our hearts the beat unfolds
Spreading the story that's been told
We're stars chasing the Milky Way
Creating our own vibrant, grim display
In a world that can't confine
Our K-pop love forever entwined
This melody is our guide
Carrying us with the tide
On this radiant K-pop ride
Our love for music far and wide
Dancing on a rhythm track
With love there is no turning back
In the spotlight we make a vow
The moment of our dreams is now
Through dancing on the rhythm track
With love there is no turning back
In the spotlight we make a vow
The moment of our dreams is now
Through the music we soar
Finding what we're searching for
In our hearts the beat unfolds
Spreading the story that's been told
We're stars chasing the Milky Way
Creating our own vibrant display
In a world that can't confine
Our K-pop love forever entwined
This melody is our guide
Carrying us with the tide
On this reggae pop ride
Our love for music far and wide
