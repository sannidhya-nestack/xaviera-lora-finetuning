Walking'neath the city lights
A world that's colored black and white
Chasing dreams through the night
It's you and I side by side
In this moment, can't you see
We're ballast like the deep blue sea
Burning brighter, you and me
We're dancing in these K-pop dreams
Echoes of our laughter ring
Underneath the moon's bling-bling
Just keep your heart on a string
In this K-pop song
We will sing
In this rhythm
Can't you feel
Our love story
It's surreal
Through every spoken ordeal
In this K-pop world we're healed
In the tunes of night and day
In our hearts we find our way
K-pop music will, will sway
In our song of love we'll stay
With every beat, can't you see
Our hearts are sinking in harmony
In the glow of this melody
We're dancing in our K-pop story
In the world of black and white
K-pop music brings the light
With you by my side tonight
We dance'til morning light
