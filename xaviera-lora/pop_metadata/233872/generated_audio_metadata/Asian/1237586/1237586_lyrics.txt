Grace on the dance floor, he's a sight to see
But when she trips, oh what a comedy
High heels and confidence, a dangerous plan
Watch her stumble, it's a graceful end
Twirling and then swirling, she still stands
Watch her stumble, it's a graceful end
Twirling and swirling
Twirling then, no matter how she tries
Grace falls down but she's up from the earth and
Tripping over feelings, she's out of her way
Hard to tango, delicate dance
Grace takes such a chance
In a world of chaos she's a ray of light
But when she trips it's a hilarious sight
Laughing at herself she takes a bow
Grace shines even in the low
Spinning and grinning, she plays the part
Then comes the stumble, work of art
Laughs at the crowd, no need to cry
Grace falls down but she'll touch the sky
Grace falls down but she's found a clumsy affair
Tripping over feelings, she's found her way
Hearts in a tangle, a delicate dance, grace
Take such a chance in a world so serious
She's a comic relief
Grace, grace
Find joy in the midst of grief
Amidst the grief, amidst the fear
Stumble there, let your eyes listen without a care
Grace, a clumsy orphan
Tripping over feelings she's done underway
Heart to the table, delicate dance
Grace, takes such a chance
Even when so serious
She's a comic relief
Grace, Grace, clumsy orphan
