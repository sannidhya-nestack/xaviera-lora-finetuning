Illuminate
A cat prowls, eyes gleaming bright
Chasing shadows that they fight
A mouse scurries hard, coming fast
Trying to escape the cat's grasp
In the dance of fate, predator and prey collide
In the game of love, their fate has tied
Moonlight hunts
Hearts entwined, chasing dreams in the dark
Whispers of love, fake design in this moonlit park
The cat's paws move with grace, the sun chasing the night's embrace
The mouse trembles, fear its eyes as the cat draws near with silent cries
In the shadows a love story unfolds
A cat's desire, a mouse's ball
Moonlight hunt, hearts entwined
Chasing dreams in the dark
Whispers of love, fake design
In this lonely power
Two souls in the night
Bound by destiny's might
A cat and mouse's plight
Love's eternal flight
Moonlight hunt
Hearts entwined
Chasing dreams in the dark
Whispers of love
Fake design
In this moonlit park
In the moonlit night landscape is played
In the dance of light and shade, cats and mouse
