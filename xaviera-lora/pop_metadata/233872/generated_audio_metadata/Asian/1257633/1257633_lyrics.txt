On the streets of Seoul under the neon lights
Your smile shines brighter, feels so right
Look in your eyes, they're my starry night
It's you who owns my heart in every sight
Time stands still in the mirror
Drawn in a melody only we could hear
In a crowd of millions, it's you I see
In our world of music, we are free
Sing it with me, let our voices soar
Our hearts beating in rhythm, yearning for more
In this flashing moment where dreams collide
We dance, we sing under the K-pop tide, ah
City of dreams, whispers in the air
Lost in the rhythm in the song we share
With you beside me got no fear
In harmony our path is clear
Sing it with ye, let our spirits align
With every beat, every note, in every rhyme
In this vibrant world where love resides
We dance, we sing, caught in the K-pop ride
Here in this moment, under the moon's bright gaze
We got each other lost in a lyrical haze
As the song ends with the final chime
This is our love story, etched in time
Sing it with me, let our voices soar
Our hearts beating in rhythm, yearning for more
In this flashing moment where dreams collide
The dance we sing under the K-pop tide
