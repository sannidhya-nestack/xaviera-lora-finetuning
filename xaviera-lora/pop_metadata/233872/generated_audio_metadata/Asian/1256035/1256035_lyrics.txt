Underneath the sunlight
Lost in the city sights
Hear the rhythm in the air
Feeling free without a care
Eyes meet in the neon glow
Hearts beat in tempo
K-pop love, it's a sweet melody
A rhythm that sets our spirits free
Under the stars where we want to be
Caught in a spell in our K-pop reverie
Movements sing to the pulse and beat
Strangers on the street
Then the laughter in the rain
Music heals all the pain
In the city we unite
Lost in K-pop delight
K-pop love is what dreams unfold
Stories of passion love untold
In the rhythm in the night a love so bold
K-pop love attempt to be whole
Cause the words in the twilight haze caught in the K-pop craze
In this moment love is found in the music we are bound
K-pop love let the rhythm sound in our hearts we are homeward bound
K-pop love is for dreams of hope
Stories of passion, love untold
In the rhythm, in the night, a love so bold
K-pop love, a tale to behold
'Cause the words and the call I hate is caught in the K-pop craze
In this moment love is found, in the music we are bound
K-pop love, let the rhythm sound, in our hearts we are homeward bound
