Intoxicated in sublimity
Your presence I can smell so rare
A touch setting lights aflame
In this potion of desire we became
Seduction in the night
Desires by your brain
Lost in a love so intense
Our souls infine, immense
Aphrodisiac, the love we chase
Hearts entwined in us, so we obey
Aphrodisiac, the love we chase
Hearts entwined in us, sensual and brave
Love's elixir, we obey
Like a Dracula's effect
A taste of you I can't reject
Intoxicated by your touch
In this Aphrodisiac club
Rush, rush, aphrodisiac rush
Aphrodisiac, the love we chase
Hearts in flight in a sensual way
Love's an answer, we obey
기억의 감정이 우릴 위감아
가릴 수 없는 너를 키워
네 베개 품속 나의 마음
사랑을 멈추지 놓치지 않아
Aphrodisiac, the love we chase
Hearts in flight in a sensual way
Love's an answer, we obey
Aphrodisiac, the love we chase
Hearts of lime in a sensual array
Love's an if-ser, we obey
Aphrodisiac, the love we chase
Hearts of lime in a sensual array
Love's an if-ser, we obey
Seduction in the night
Desire, Sire, burning bright
