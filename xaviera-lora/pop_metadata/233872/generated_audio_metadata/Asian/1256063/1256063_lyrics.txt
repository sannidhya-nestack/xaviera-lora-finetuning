In the cityscape of Seoul, on the red onion lands
We move to beats in the midst of the nights
In the pulse of screaming streets, in the ever-blow
We find our heartbeats, we find our flow
Oh song, you're the rhythm in my veins
In this crazy world you're my sustain
In the shining skyline all lights are ablaze
Our hearts dance in this endless maze
With you on these city streets
Where tradition and eternity meets
In your embrace under the city lights
We lose ourselves in soul's delights
Oh soul, you're the rhythm in my veins
In this crazy world you're my sustain
In the shining skyline, all lights are ablaze
Our hearts dance in this endless maze
Beneath the moon on these city streets
Where tradition and modernity meets
In your embrace under the city lights
We lose ourselves in Seoul's daylight
Oh Seoul, you're the money and the rhyme
You're the harmony eternity meets
In your shadow we find our feet
Our hearts echo the soul's dream
In the heart of soul we paint our tale
On the canvas of these streets we set sail
In the dance of lights where love ignites
This is all I see, oh nice
Oh soul, our love unfolds
In your rhythm our story molds
Where the skyline sings, heart strings ring
Soul, you are everything
In the symphony of soul we found our pitch
In the cityscape we found our niche
With every beat, with every sigh
Soul, you are our lullaby
In the symphony of soul we found our pitch
In the cityscape we found our niche
With every beat, with every sigh
Soul you are our lullaby
