Underneath the moonlit sky
In the shadows you're driving flying
Whispers of the ghost they call her
Echoes of a soul's downfall
Dancing with demons in the night
Haunted by visions of you inside
Fate's cruel hands begin to play
Leading me to the gallows, no light out there
Silence screams in the dead of night
Echoes of a heart consumed by fright
Tears fall like rain, I find the prayer
Standing in your strip dance
Sadness can't seem to cut walls
In the darkness came a gust
Chains of regret heavy on my soul
In this place where shadows take their toll
Stars of the lost and damned
In the gallows where destiny's so cramped
Silence pulls out death and evil
As I walk towards the unknown shore
Silence springs in the dead of night
Echoes of a heart consumed by fright
Tears fall like rain, a final prayer
Spin me at the gallows, you bear
Stay there girls, stay there
Standing at your final, final place
Standing at the gallows, stay there
