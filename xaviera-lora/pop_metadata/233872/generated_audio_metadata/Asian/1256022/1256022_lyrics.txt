Time and skies are broken, this may be a blinding light
Underneath just us, seven secret nights
With your hand in mine, feels like winter or still light
In the rhythm of K-pop, we find our endless flight
Through the buzzing city in the neon haze
With our hearts entwined like a binding maze
I'll keep our melody an enchanting phase
Some beneath the stars in the city's embrace
Through the buzz in the city in the neon haze
With our hearts entwined like a binding maze
Our K-pop melody, an enchanting phase
Sung beneath the stars in the city's embrace
Silhouettes in the moonlight dancing through the streets
In this endless harmony where love uniquely breathes
A symphony revealed in our intertwining heartbeats
Drowned in K-pop rhythm where passion fleetingly meets
In the city's heartbeat we move to its core
Loving in the rhythm yearning for more
K-pop love story unlike any before
Through the cityscape let our love roar
Underneath the skyline with whispers in the wind
The city of dreams where our love's signed and pinned
Forever linked in rhythm and love we're twined
In our gave up timeline a love song rescinded
In the city's heartbeat
With whispers in the wind
With our hearts entwined like a winding maze
Our K-pop melody, an enchanting phase
Sung beneath the stars in the city's embrace
Silhouettes in the moonlight, dancing through the streets
In this endless harmony, where love uniquely greets
A symphony revealed in our intertwining heartbeats
Dry beats
Drown in K-pop rhythm where passion fleetingly meets
