In the blur of the city lights, we laugh and cry
Sailing through the endless dreams of you and I
In the hush of the moonlit night, our hearts collide
Chasing shadows dancing in the corners of our mind
Fly high, we're gonna touch the sky
Spread wings under the moon's bright eye
Wishing on a star so high
Never let this moment pass us by
Whisper words and melodies under neon glow
Paint our dreams on city streets where the night winds blow
Through the darkness, we'll follow the light
In our hearts, we hold tight
To the magic of the night
We're gonna dance in the rhythm of the rain
Drown our sorrows, wash away our pain
Hold my hand, we'll make it through
There's nothing in this world we cannot do
Fly high like I'm gonna touch the sky
Spread wings under the moon's bright eye
Wishing on a star so high
Never let this moment pass us by
Underneath the starlit sky, we say goodbye
