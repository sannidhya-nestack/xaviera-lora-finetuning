And tonight it's fun
Got me feeling so unusual
Caught up in your eyes and my own personal moon
I've been caught in you for days
Been totally spun
You're my shooting dawn
My personal rising sun
In this dance of love
In our rhythm divine
Our hearts beat in sync
In our harmonious aligning
Throw myself in love on the by
In the quiet of the night
In this brilliant symphony
You are my starlight
Every fragment of you completes my soul's melody
In this picturesque scenery, you're the masterpiece I see
Our voices tangled in harmony, under the midnight sky
In a dance of constellations, your love I can't deny
Hold up in this love like a soothing serenade
In your arms every fear and worry beautifully fade
In this love song our feelings are the sweetest tune
In our universe you're my sun, my stars, my moon
In this dance of love, in our rhythm divine
Our hearts beat in sync in a harmonious line
You're my soothing lullaby in the quiet of the night
In this brilliant symphony you are my starlight
In this dance of love we're in a magical verse
In this symphony of our hearts you remain my universe
Every fragment of you completes my soul's melody
In this picturesque scenery, you're the masterpiece I see
Our voices tangled in harmony under the midnight sky
In the dance of constellations, you are my starlight
In this dance of love, in our rhythm divine
Our hearts beat and we sing in a harmonious rhyme
You're my pseudorhymophy in the quiet of the night
In this brilliant symphony you are my starlight
In this dance of love we've written a magical verse
In the symphony of our hearts you remain my universe
