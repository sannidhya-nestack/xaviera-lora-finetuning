Show me illegal, strong and true
Getting light in the dark, breaking through
Courageous heart, a new day might
In the shadows, you shine so brightly
Lead the way through the storm, inspire us, keep us warm
Show me a leader, bold and clear
In a world of doubt and fear
Show me a leader
And I'll trust reactions of love, a voice of reason you can't scream
Show me a leader in your dreams
Standing tall against the tide
In your footsteps we will strive
Wisdom's missing every word in your presence
Hope is stirred, lead the way through the storm
Inspire us, keep us warm
Show me a leader, bold and clear
In a world of doubt and fear
Show me a leader
In our eyes of love
And I'll trust the actions of love
A voice of reason you can't scream
Show me a leader in your dreams
빛나는 별처럼 조용한 밤을 비추는 리더
우리의 마음을 움직이는 목소리
우리를 의심하게 하는 존재
Show me a leader 우리의 꿈의 리더
And I'll trust, leave my shoes in love, and find some reason you can't breathe (show me)
