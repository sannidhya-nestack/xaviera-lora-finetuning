Waking up with the morning light
You're not by my side
Empty room, a missing piece
Trying but can't hide
Caught up in the memories
Playing in my head
Your laughter and your smile
The words that you said
This is our song, to the break of dawn
We danced and sang, seemed nothing was wrong
The beats are loud, the lights are low
Just you and I
Lost in the show, lost in the show
Walking through the crowd, your hand holding mine
Your eyes sparkling brightly like a star they shine
Moonlit night and whispering the story of our love that forever sings
Beneath the moonlight's glow
Time stands still
As our feelings flow
The rhythm takes over
We lose control
Just you and I
Pouring out our soul
As the melody fades, your touch lingers on
Through the silence, our heart beats on
An echo in the night, a love so strong
This is our song, the place we belong
