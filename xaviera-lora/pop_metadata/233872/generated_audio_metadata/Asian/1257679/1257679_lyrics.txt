Every night under these city lights
Walking alone dreaming about you
Caught in this rhythm my heart so bright
The stars can't help but shine around you
You are like K-pop in my heart
Music in my soul
Got me dancing in the daylight
Everywhere I go
In the rhythm, in the movement
In the beat that never stops
You're the melody that pulses
You're my favorite K-pop
Oh, oh
On silent streets beneath the moon's glow
Shadows dancing lost in thoughts you'll know
In the soft light where dreams may grow
Feel your heartbeat, let's take it slow
You are like K-pop in my heart
Music in my soul
Got me swaying in the moonlight
Everywhere I go, in the rain
