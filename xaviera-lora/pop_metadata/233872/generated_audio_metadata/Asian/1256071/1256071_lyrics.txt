Tonight, under the neon glow
Walking through streets, head to toe
City lights, flickering, catching our breath
Our shadows dance as we et the rest
We're painting dreams in this all night sky
Chasing the love we can't deny
Your eyes twinkle they match the stars
In the rhythm of our beating hearts
With melodies whispering in the wind
In the rhythm of soul let our story begin
Through hustling streets under the moon's watch
In the cityscape we lose and find our match
We're painting dreams in the soul night sky
Chasing the love we can't deny
Your eyes twinkle they match the stars
In the rhythm of our beating hearts
With melodies whispering in the wind
In the rhythm of soul let our story begin
Through hustling streets under the moon's watch
In this cityscape we lose and find our match
We're painting dreams in this all night sky
Chasing the love we can't deny
Your eyes twinkle they match the stars
In the rhythm of our beating hearts
In the midnight hour we share our tale
Under the soul city lights love will never fail
Smiles shimmer and roll in the skyline
In your arms every moment is divine
