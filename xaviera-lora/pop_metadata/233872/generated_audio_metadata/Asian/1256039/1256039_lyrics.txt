Underneath the storm night sky, I sing
Thinking of you, the joy you bring
Your smile outshining every neon light
Without you things just don't seem right
This is my Korean pop song, my tune
About us under the crescent moon
I miss your voice, I miss your touch
I miss your love oh so much
In the bustling streets I sway
To the memories of your laugh, your playful way
Korean pop playing our song in the air
I turned around wishing you were there
This is my Korean pop, my melody
A tale of love, us in harmony
Back to me, let's hit replay
I miss you more with each passing day
Singing under the starlit night
Hoping you come back, make it right
In this Korean pop song it's you I see
In my heart you'll forever be
