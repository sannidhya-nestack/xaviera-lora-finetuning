Sitting at the soul, in your close way
Captured in a rhythm, letting music lead the way
Underneath the stars, sharing stories untold
In your eyes, a universe of wonder to behold
Korean pop's melody echoes within our hearts
In this magic cityscape where our love story starts
Caught in the rhythm together in this dance
Crossing solid bridges we take a chance
Pedestrian lanes, rustling streets teem with life
We navigate this exciting strife
Held by the song, in chorus we unite
In the dance of love, we're swords in new heights
In this Korean pop symphony, our hearts resonate
Under neon skies, love illuminates
Swaying in harmony, in the music we confide
In soul's melody
We take the ride
A music phase but
The rhythm remains in our hearts
It forever rains (forever rains)
In this Korean pop tunnel
Under the moon's soft light (soft light)
We found our rhythm
In soul's twilight
