Caught up in this noisy city lights are dancing under the glowing moon
Your eyes entrancing, walking side by side
We're feeling the magic in every moment shared
It's kinda classic, we're cleaning memories
In vibrant colors of love like stars above
Enchanting like a dream
So let's dance in the neon glow
Let our spirits free and flow under the moonlight
Just you and me
Heartbeat synchronized as we keep on walking
Conversations flow in with laughter and talking
It's these little things that make my heart flutter
All throughout the night words we softly utter
We'll weave the tales in the canvas of the night
Hold on tight, beneath the shooting stars' flight
So let's sway in the velvet breeze
Listen this melody under the moonlight
Words we softly utter
We're painting the night on the knee
Da-da-da-da-na-na-na-na
Da-da-da-da-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, we're good and na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, we're good and na-na-na-na
Breathing tales in the canvas of the night, hold on tight
Beneath the shooting stars, white
So let's sway in the velvet breeze
Lost in this melody, under the moonlight
It's our story to write
So here we are in the depth of the night
With hearts alight, embraced by love so bright
So let's sway in the velvet
Please, lost in this melody
Under the moonlight
It's our story to write
We're being me-me-me-me-me-me-me
Be-be-be-be-be-be-be
Be-be-be-be-be-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
We're being me-me-me-me
Be-be-be-be-be-me-me-me-me
Be-be-be-be-be-be-be
Na
Heartbeats synchronize as we keep on walkin'
Conversations flowin' with laughter and talkin'
It's these little things that make my heart flutter
All throughout the night words we softly utter
We're paid and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then
