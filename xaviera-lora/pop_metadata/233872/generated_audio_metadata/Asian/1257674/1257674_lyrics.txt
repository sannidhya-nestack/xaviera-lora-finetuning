Sailing underneath the stars
We've come so far from where we are
Every beat inside my heart pulses for you
Right from the start
Neon lights flash our tail
In this K-pop rhythm we succeed
Our song breaks every scale
And this love story will never fail
Dreams painted in fiery hues
Boundless love we did choose
In the melody we infuse
Our K-pop love story makes the news
Can't you feel the heartbeats rush
In the silence a hush-hush
In the symphony of our crush
In this K-pop world a secret blush
Through the echoes of the city light
In the music we take flight
K-pop dancing in the moonlight
Our love shines oh so bright
With every verse can't you see
We're woven into this melody
In the rhythm of our love's decree
We dance in our K-pop euphony
Against the backdrop of city shine
In the K-pop beat our hearts aligned
In the music your hand in mine
We'll dance in our love'til the end of time
