Watch me break on the tie
Stars in my eyes, nights long gone
This small city underneath the lights we roam
In this dream we are forever young
Our heart beats strong to the same rhythm
In a world full of color we find our vision
Sharing stories while laughter's soaring
This is where you found out a story blooming
Through the echoes of the night
Under the moonlight shining so bright
We dance whilst our secrets ignite
This is K-pop our dreams taking flight
Under the radiant city skyline
The dreams sing and intertwine
With the melody, the lyrics and the time
In this K-pop world we chime
We're stars in a universe so vast
Chasing love that's bound to last
In this music we found our path
In this K-Pop world we shine
We're stars in a universe so vast
Chasing love that's bound to last
In this music we found our path
K-Pop it's our home and that's a fact
So here's all to our dreams and the night
In this K-Pop tale we create our own light
With every lyric every beat every sight
We paint the sky in our own ways we delight
Here we go under the city lights
Our dreams untamed soaring in flight
Through the dancing shadows of the night
In a world of K-pop everything feels right
In this melody we find our story
A tale of love, passion and glory
We move to the rhythm, feel the beat
This is K-Pop where dreams and reality meet
We dance to the rhythm, mostly with sound
In this world of music, we are unbound
This is K-Pop, it's our escape
The trees take shape and hearts awake
In the heartbeat of the neon lights
Or dream chasers caught in mid flight
Through the noise we find delight
In this K-pop world we ignite
In this galaxy of stars we shine bright
In the world of K-pop there's no end in sight
Every beat every note is a delight
This is our anthem lighting up the night
In the heart of the night
