In a passing city I, I am dancing all alone
Hear the rhythm in the streets, it's a beat I've never known
Turning corners chasing dreams, lost within the neon glow
Oh the night is young and we're ready to go
Can you feel the rhythm, feel the K-pop beat?
Moving through the music, feeling the heat
Hearts on fire, it's an electrifying treat
This is our world, so get up on your feet
Shadows whisper tales of love
Tales of joy and tales of fear
Yet we bravely chase the dawn
Embrace the love that's here
Through the music, through the night
Hear the melody rise and fall
With our voices, we answer the call
Can you feel the rhythm, feel the K-Pop beat?
Lost within the magic, isn't it sweet?
With the music flowing, our hearts are alight
This is our moment, shining so bright
In the light of day or under
