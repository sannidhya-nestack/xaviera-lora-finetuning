Walking down the city lights, beach, smiling under the night
Caught in this rhythm, I've been feeling so right
In this landscape of dreams, I move with the beat
Underneath the stardust where destiny and hopes meet
Oh, our heart's a tune, it's a sweet serenade
In this melody we've spun, I'm no longer afraid
We're shining like stars in this cosmic ballet
Together we'll conquer come what may
Dancing through life in our own unique way
In this K-pop rhythm we sway
Every beat drops a promise
In this symphony suite
With the moon as our witness
In this tale so free
Between the whispers of the wind
Our voices entwine
In the stanzas from stories leaving worries behind
Caught in the daydream under the platinum sky
With the rhythm in our hearts we aim so high
This K-pop magic like a lovely lullaby
In this harmony we lose track of time all night
As the song fades into the silence so deep
I hold on to these memories in my heart to keep
As the song fades into the silence so deep
I hold on to these memories in my heart to keep
As the song fades into the silence so deep
I hold on to these memories in my heart to keep
