Hey
Cruising down the neon lights as spirits take in flight
Dance into the rhythm that feels so right
Everything's a blur except your face
In the crowd you're the only trace
Playing k-pop loud and clear
In our hearts there's no fear
Dance'til dawn lost in the beat
Feeling your touch oh so sweet
Caught like fireflies in the night
Under the stars, shining bright
Every heartbeat, entwined with the bass
Life feels perfect in this place
Turn the K-pop up, let the world stop
Swaying in the rhythm as the beat drop
Locked in the moment, feeling so high
Underneath the moonlit sky
Just you, me and the K-pop tune
Blends with the city under the moon
Dancing our hearts away
In this melody we sway
Play it pop, play it on repeat
Dancing on cloud nine, feeling the heat
Play it pop, play it on repeat
Can't still, dawn lost in the beat
Feeling your touch, oh so sweet
K-pop play it on repeat
Dancing on the line feeling the heat
Dance till dawn lost in the beat
Feeling your touch oh so sweet
