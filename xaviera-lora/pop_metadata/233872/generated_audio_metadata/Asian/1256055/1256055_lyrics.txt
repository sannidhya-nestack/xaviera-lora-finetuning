Underneath the neon lights
In the rhythm of the night
Caught in an endless time
My heart wants to take flight
Stars are bright
Sky is clear
Can you feel that you are near?
In the city that never sleeps
I found a love that really keeps
We're dancing away in our Korean pop dream
Everything's not what it always seems
We don't need words, your eyes speak to me
In this vibrant city
We're making our own destiny
Street art colors, our love story
In this metropolis of mystery
Under skyscrapers reaching for the cloud
In the silence where the music's loud
We're dancing away in our Korean pop tree
Past the noise and the city's gleam
You and I, we're stepping to the beat
In our youth, we find love so sweet
As the night sky swallows the day
In the moonlight, we will sweat
Heart of the city, heart of this song
In this Korean heart dream, we belong
