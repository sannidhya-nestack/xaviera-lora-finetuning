Like the glow cities pose in the chaos we find our course
Whispers, fears, dreams at night
And the night will take flight (night)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-night)
High time to push it
Go on a life, urika tsumare sa
In the moment, what's about it?
Say baby, molten black
Tell every rhyme on the line
If you will climb so high
I didn't know if you are kings and fine
In the hustle, we'll find our sign
You'll be a danger
Dreams awake, spirits rise, and the rhythm will realize
Eyes on us, spirits soar, in the music we explore
Dreams ignite, hearts alive, in the darkness we'll unite
Hard times, open 시간, we're alive, 우리가 살아 있어
In the moment, what's about it? It's every beat, 모든 발자, every rhyme, 모든 line, we feel we'll climb so high
Hard times, open 시간, we're alive, 우리가 살아 있어
In the moment, what's about it? It' every beat, 모든 발자, every rhyme, 모든 line, we feel we'll climb so high
I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been-a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I've been a-I' I've been
High times
(Nobunshika)
(Marenai)
(Furika saraisa)
In the moment what's about
In it's every beat
More than butcher every line
More than line
With you we'll climb so high
High times
We shake our life
우리가 살아 있어
In the moment what's about it?
It's happening
모든 박자를 ride
모든 line
With you we'll climb so high
우린 a heist to the lost
In the music of our past summer hours
When our heart times
(떠오른 시간만을 life)
우리가 살아있어
(In the moment we survive)
우린 it's every beat
(More than butchered every rhyme)
(More than line with you)
We'll climb so high
(To the heist)
(To the beat)
(In the heist)
