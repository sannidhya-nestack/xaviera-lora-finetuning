In the dawn, flowers will rest
꽃잎 피어 under skies
Whisper soft dreams away
너와 함께 we'll partake
Eyes meet, you and me in this garden
We are born again, hold hands
Take a leap with you, you and me we'll keep
Blue in the light, together with you, take flight
Every bloom, every hue with you, you and me, I'm a hue
In your gaze, colors swirl
Nymphoscope, your scent spreads
Promises, never fail
With you, our love twirls
Eyes locked, you and I
In this garden, the fire burns
Promises, never fail
With you, our love twirls
Eyes locked, 너와 나 in this garden
우리 다시 태어나 손을 잡아
Take a leap with you, 너와 나 we'll keep
Blue in the lights, 너와 함께 I'll take flight
Every blue, every hue with you, 너와 나 I've been you
Through the storms, through the rain
너와 함께, you and me
In your love, I found my truth
너만 날 위해 I'll love him too
Bison loves, 너와 나
In this garden, 우리 다시 태어나
손을 잡아 take the lead with you
너와 나 we'll keep bloom in the light
너와 함께 I'll take flight
Every bloom, every hue with you
너와 나 I renew
