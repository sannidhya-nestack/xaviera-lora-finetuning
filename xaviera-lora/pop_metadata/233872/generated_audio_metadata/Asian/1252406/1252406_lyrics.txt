Hushed in the echo of your voice, a pure, rich, and cold touch
Was promises so much
We found love in a crowded place
A beautiful, unending chase
Your smile, a ray of sun
With you, your battles are won
Every moment, treasured grace in your eyes
I see my love together
We'll roll through the storms
But strong with you I belong
Lost in your echo, feeling right
Holding you, my guiding light
Hand in hand, day and night
I'm the story line
With you, I belong
Lost in your echo, you know
Holding you like I be mine
Hand in hand say you're mine, our love, a story bright
Through the storms, we're strong with you I belong
Lost in your echo, feeling right
Holding you, my guiding light
Hand in hand, day and night, our love, a story bright
