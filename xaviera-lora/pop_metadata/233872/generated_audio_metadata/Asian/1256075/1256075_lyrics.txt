I feel it move just so slightly
Your eyes sparkle oh so sweet
Under a skylight where dreams untreat
Our hearts sink in rhythm every time they meet
Korean pop sound takes us high
Underneath the neon lit sky
In this moment we can touch the sky
In our K-pop world love won't lie
The night is young, the stars align
Caught in the melody lost in time
With every beat with every rhyme
Your heart beats with mine oh so divine
Korean pop song ignites the night
In the city's pulse we take flight
In this symphony we hold up tight
In a K-pop world it feels so right
Oh as the night envelops the city's glow
Our love story in K-pop continues to flow
Under the skies nightly show
This is our world
This is our K-pop echo
The night is young
Stars align
Caught in the melody, lost in time
With every beat, with every rhyme
Your heart beats with mine, oh so divine
As the night envelops the city's glow
A love story in K-pop continues to flow
Under the skies, nightly show
This is our world, this is our K-pop, bad girl
As the night envelops the city's glow
Our love story in K-Pop continues to flow
Under the sky's nightly show
This is our world
This is our K-Pop echo
