Wake up morning lights, Seoul city vibe
In the heart of the rhythm, we thrive
Reflections in your eyes, love's secret archive
Underneath the stars, our dreams arrive
K-pop love underneath the sky
Our hearts beating to the city night fly
With every pop note we touch the sky high
In this dance of love we amplify
Walk in the streets, neon lights guide
Your whispers in the wind, my love, confide
In the magic of music, together we abide
In this Korean beat, our hearts coincide
K-pop rhythm, let the bass play
Under the moonlight we sashay
Each vibrant note, a new pathway
In the symphony of love we sway
In the melody of the night we roam free
Your love, the K-Pop beat, my heart's decree
Underneath the starlight, you and me
This is our last song, our own love's free
In the melody of the night we roam free
Your love, the K-Pop beat, my heart's decree
Underneath the starlight, you and me
This is our, our song, our own love's three
