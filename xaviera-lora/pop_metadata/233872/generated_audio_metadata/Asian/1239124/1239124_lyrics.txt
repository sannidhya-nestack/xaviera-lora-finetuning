In the neon glow of city lights
Dialing numbers in the dead of night
Whispers on the line, secrets untold
In the darkness our stories unfold
Echoes of voices in the night
Connections made out of time
Lost in the static of silent plea
Yearning for a voice to set us free
Hotline blazes through the dark
A lifeline in a world so stark
Hearts reaching out in the fray
As we navigate the night and day
Silhouettes dance in the moonlit haze
On the edge of dawn's first rays
Words unspoken, hearts laid bare
In the realm of the midnight air
Crack and say a distant hum
In the darkness we succumb
Lost in the echoes of our past
Searching for a love that'll last
Hotline burning through the night
Guiding us towards the light
Whispers of hope in the dark
As we embark on a brand new start
In the silence between each call
We find solace and hope
In the echoes of a voice
We discover our shared choice
Of night shining through the night
A pin discovery shared choice
