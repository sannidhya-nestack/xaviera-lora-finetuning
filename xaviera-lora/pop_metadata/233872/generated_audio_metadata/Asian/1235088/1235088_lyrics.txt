Stay on me, run along, we run along
Sudden loses her sense of song
Eyes meet, no need to speak
Our connection runs deep
In sync with every heartbeat
Minds intertwined, no need to repeat
A sync with every heartbeat
Minds intertwined, no need to repeat
A bond unbreakable, you and me
Telepathic harmony
Telepathic harmony
Telepathy, a silent symphony
No one's needed, just you and me
In this cosmic dance, we're free
Connected by destiny, me
Connected by destiny, you and me
Our connection is deep
Just thinking about it makes us understand each other
같은 운명이의 약속
하늘에 나는 그 작은 느낌
우리의 오늘
함께한 지금부터 영원히
마음이 하나인 우리
다음에 파티 우리의 비디에
세상 끝까지 함께할게
Through the chaos we find peace
A connection that will never cease
In a world of noise, we are silent song
Together where we belong
There are bad fears, a silent symphony
No one's me, just you and me
In this cosmic dance we're free
Connected by destiny
Connected by destiny
