In this world filled with colors, you're my perfect shade
Walking through a maze of lights, hearts ready unswayed
In the middle of the crowd, a secret glance we trade
With every step we're dancing, a silent serenade
We're creating memories
Under vibrant city lights
In a melody that plays
In our heart-stirring nights
Hold on to these moments
Don't let them out of sight
In this harmony of ours
Everything feels so right
Mirror ball reflections in your eyes all I see
In this rhythm of the night where we are meant to be
Caught in the rhythm, we're lost in our own screen
With you everything fades and it's only you I see
We're creating memories under vibrant city lights
In a melody that plays in our heart story nights
Hold on to these moments
Don't let them out of sight in this harmony
