Wandering through the dreams, where our fate gently weaves
In a world where love never leaves, we've got no time to grieve
Your smile is my sunrise, melting the ice in my heart
Even in chaos we won't fall apart
Whispers of forever echo through the nights in your embrace
All serene and light, conquer the fears without hands entwined
Carving our story, leaving doubts behind
Through the stormy weather, we'll find our way
With love as our compass, guiding each day
Your laughter my melody, lighting up the camp
Death knew the shadows our spirits will engage
Every heartbeat tells the promises we made
In this symphony of love we'll never fade
Holding on to dreams we'll build our paradise
With you my love through every sacrifice
Forever and always
Our love will shine brighter than the stars
You turn me divine in my heart
Even in the chaos, we won't fall apart
We feel my love through every sacrifice
Forever and always, our love will shine
Brighter than the stars, eternally divine
In my heart
Brighter than the stars, eternally divine
