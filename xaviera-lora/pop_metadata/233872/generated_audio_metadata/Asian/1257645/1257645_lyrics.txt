How can I et, love your smile so bright
The sparkling eyes, your laugh so light
Walking on the street as the day turns night
Your hand in mine, it feels so right
We're dancing under a million stars
Living life healing scars
In the city of dreams where no place is far
Our hearts beating to the rhythm of our K-pop avatar
Whisper secret shared dreams
In our world everything's not what it seems
Broken boundaries, crossing streams
With you I found what love means
We're dancing under a million stars
Living life, healing scars
Ooh, in the city of dreams where no place is
Far, our hearts beating to the rhythm of our K-pop avatar
Whispered secrets, shared dreams
In our world, everything's not what it seems
Broken boundaries, crossing streams
With you I found what love means
We're dancing under a million stars
Finding ourselves in distant bazaars
In a world where every moment's ours
Drenched in the melody of our K-Pop memoirs
You and I, it's a mystic tale
Together we embarked to sail
In this cosmic dance we never fail
Our love more enduring than any crazy
Dancing under a million stars
In our own universe, no prison bars
Through notes and beats, we're avatars
K-pop is our language, love's vocabulary
Together under the night, under the moon
Singing our song, the world in tune
With you every moment is a boon
K-pop love, a cosmic rune
