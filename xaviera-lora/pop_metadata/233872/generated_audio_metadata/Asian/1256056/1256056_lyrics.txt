Mid-morning song, steady breeze
Whispers of history under the neon leaves
Feels like a dream, every step on the pavement
Caught in the rhythm, the youthful enchantment
We rise, we fall
In the heart of it all
In soul
Under the setting sun
In the symphony
Of the city we're one
Every alley
Each story
A secret to unfold
In the heart of soul
Where dreams are told
Live in the moments, minute by minute
Here in Seoul, we're riding it
Here as we fall, in the heart of it all
In Seoul, under the setting sun
In the symphony of the city we're one
Every alley, each story, a secret to unfold
In the heart of soul, where dreams are told
Living the moments, minute by minute
Here in soul, we're writing it in
We arise, we fall
In the heart of it all
In soul, under the setting sun
In the melody of the city, we're one
As the night unfolds, under the city's glowing soul
We're part of the show
I've been thinking about it, I've been thinking about it
Living the moments, minute by minute
Hearing soul, we're riding it, we're up
