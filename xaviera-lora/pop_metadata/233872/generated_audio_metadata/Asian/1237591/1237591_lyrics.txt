Across the waves our hearts entwine
Distance grows but love defined
With a squeeze carried by the sea
In your arms where I long to be
Miles apart yet close in soul
Tides of love beyond control
An ocean while our love's so deep
In dreams at night our hearts still keep
An ocean between us loves true test
Bound by hope in hearts we rest
Waves of longing crashing strong
In your love where I belong
Staring at the horizon's line
Memories of your touch
Horns sounds above, witness our flight
Guiding us through the darkest night
Whispers of the wind, a silent guide
Love's beacon, our hearts abide
An ocean bless, our love thus dead
In your arms is where I am
An ocean between us, love's true test
Found by hope in hearts we rest
Waves of longing crashing strong
In your love where I belong
