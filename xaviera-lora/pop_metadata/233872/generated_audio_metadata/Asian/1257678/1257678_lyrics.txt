Tap it to the beat, under the neon light
Passion in our eyes, dancing through the night
Cave out, we're in the groove
Our hearts are on the move
K-Pop, feel the pulse
Our passion, it's up above
K-Pop
Together we unite
In music we find peace
Dreaming only of the top
Will never cease
K-Pop
Don't miss the beat
Our rhythm can't be beat
K-Pop
Feel the heat
Our sound it's really neat
Shines brighter than the starlight
Our spirit takes its flight
Our spirit takes its flight
Our spirit takes its flight
Our spirit takes its flight
K-pop sound of the night
