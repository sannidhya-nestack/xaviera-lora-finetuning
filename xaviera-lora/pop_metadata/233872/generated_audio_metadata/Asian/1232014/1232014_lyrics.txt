Hit me like an earthquake
Reminiscing better days
Make those days right now
Cause you hit me like an earthquake
Hit me like an earthquake
Reminiscing better days
Make those days right now
I wonder if you met me
That would be a tragedy
If I didn't explode the shadows out of energy
I wonder if you met me
That would be a tragedy
If I didn't explode the shadows out of energy
I wonder if you met me
That would be a tragedy
If I didn't explode the shadows out of energy
I am, I am, I am, I am, I, I, I, I, I am, I am, I am, I, I, I, I, I am, I am, I, I, I, I, I am, I am, I am, I, I, I, I, I, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh (uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-huh, uh-huh (uh-uh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
I was hoping for better days
Make the better days right now
Punch me like an earthquake
Reminiscing that our days
Make those days right now
you hit me like a
Punch me like an earthquake
Reminiscing that our days
Make those days right now
'Cause you hit me like a gun, shoot me like an earthquake
Reminiscing better days, make those days rhyme (Reminiscing better days)
you hit me like a gun (Reminiscing better days)
(Reminiscing better days)
