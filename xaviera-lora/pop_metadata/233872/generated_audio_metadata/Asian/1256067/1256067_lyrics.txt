Firing in the city, glow in the night
Running through the rhythm, neon lights
Your eyes, they shine so bright, stealing my sight
Lost in this feeling, take the flight
This is our stage
Heart beats in a rage
In the heart of soul
We engage
K-Pop Symphony
Let's turn the page
Love's melody
Across the age
Stars above us, the silver rain
Caught in the rhythm, love's sweet pain
Together we dance, breaking the chain
In this moment, nothing to gain
Making me feel that beat, I'm burning and I spin
Music running deep, under our skin
This K-Pop dream, it's a win-win
Tonight we begin love's blessing
Bright city lights, painting the blue
Shining on us, feeling true
In the arena of hearts, time flew
Our lyrics hidden only for two
K-pop magic on city streets
Where love, rhythm and fantasy meets
This melody that our heart creates
Forever will repeat in timeless beats
Stars above us, the silver rain
Caught in the rhythm, love's sweet pain
Together we dance, breaking the chain
In this moment, nothing to gain
Can you feel the beat, the world in my spin
Music running deep, under our skin
This chaotic dream
It's a win-win
Tonight we begin love's best scene
Bright staining lights
Paint in the blue
Shining on us
Feeling true
In the arena of hearts
Time flew
Our lyrics written only for two
Keep our magic on city streets
I love freedom and fantasy meets
This melody that our heart greets
Forever we'll repeat in time
