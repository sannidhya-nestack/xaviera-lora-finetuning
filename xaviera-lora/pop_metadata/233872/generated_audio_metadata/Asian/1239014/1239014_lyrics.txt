In the silence of the shadow night, oh, I saw the lost eternity
Echoes of words sharp as blades, hearts entwined, now in cascades
Whispers lost in the storm's cruel wrath
Then we suffocated in his path
Lost in the wreckage of love
We were all love consumed by your relentless blood
Falling like bombs in the dead of night
Shattered dreams take their flight
Hearts collide in a fiery display
As we watch our love decay
Eyes meet in a flood decay
I sneak in a final gaze, words unspoken lost in the haze
Courage flavors emotions pray in the aftermath of our reforming
Screams of anguish pierce the air, a symphony of pain too much to bear
Lost in the debris of our past, our minds shattered fading fast
Explosions echoing the void, all of the strife left it void
Hearts torn asunder, skies turn grey
As we bid our last goodbye today
In the rain, goodbye today
On the way, in the dead of the day
In the wreckage, we stand alone
Silent and witness to love overflowing
