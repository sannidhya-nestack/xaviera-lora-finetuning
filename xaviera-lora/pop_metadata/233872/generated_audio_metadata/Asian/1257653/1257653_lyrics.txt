In the city lights, everyone don't know I'm done
Tryna chase the stars, look in my eyes
That I've filled with all these dreams, burning like a fast car
Tryna catch the wind, never following the crowd
Dance until we see the sun
Ooh, the young hearts chasing dreams in the moonlight
We're writing our names in the star dust
Not giving up without a fight
Got the rhythm in our soul
Music makes us lose control
We're dancing through the night
Chasing dreams in the moonlight
You and I, a story under the city's skyline
Our victorious battle cry, running against time
With every beat of our heart, learning to fly
In this roller coaster ride, ups and downs hold on tight
Ooh, with the old heart
Chasing dreams in the moonlight
We're carving our love in the cityscape
Shining brighter than the moonlight
Got the melody in our veins
No ties, no chains
We're dancing through the night
Chasing dreams in the moonlight
Love time under the city lights
With hearts on fire in the quiet of the night
We found our rhythm, we found our rhyme
Chasing dreams in the moonlight until the end of time
Ooh, the old hearts chasing dreams in the moonlight
Calling out love in the cityscape, shining brighter than all the lights
Got the melody in our veins, no ties, no chain
We're dancing through the night
Chasing dreams in the midnight
