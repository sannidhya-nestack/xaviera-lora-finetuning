Raindrops falling down on my knees
In the silence I whisper all my fears
Your voice the solace of dust and rain
And your love, I find strength again
Days pass by in a blurry haze for me
With your love I find my ways
Clocks may tick but time will defy
A love eternal and we'll never die
Through stormy nights you are my light
A beacon of hope shining so bright
Together we face tomorrow's day
With you forever we'll abide
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Abide
Raindrops fall, they mirror my tears
In the silence, I whisper all my fears
Your voice is solemn, soft as the rain
In your love, I find strength again
Days pass by in a blurry haze
But with your love, I find my ways
Clocks may tick, but time will define
A love eternal, it will never die, ooh
Through stormy nights, you are my light
A beacon of hope, shining so bright
Together we face tomorrow's day
With you forever we'll abide
Through stormy nights, you're all my light
A beacon of hope shining so bright
Together we face tomorrow's tide
With you forever we'll abide, abide, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Abide, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, abide
