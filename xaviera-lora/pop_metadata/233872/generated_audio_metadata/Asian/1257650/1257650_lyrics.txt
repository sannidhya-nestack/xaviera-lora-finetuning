Breathe in the city light
Embrace the cape on night
Don't need to ask your echo is bright
Our love story under the soaring kite
With the stars as our sight
We'll dance until it's light
Let the rhythm play, K-pop is our ballet
In the city where dreams never sway
Under the moon we'll sway, we'll dance until day
Our hearts as the DJ play, love sweet replay
Stars above, your smile is my love
In this K-Pop dream, you're all I think of
Together we'll prove like a fitted glove
Our hearts sing and set free like a dove
This K-Pop beat, our hearts in repeat
And the melodies here, I'll never defeat
Under the moon's retreat
Feeling so complete in this magnetic street
Our story's a leap in this K-pop stare
With the love from within until the end
It's a game we'll win, this rhythm under our skin
Love's sweet violin with you every night
It's a victory every day's a win
Rise above, oh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This turns above, your smile is my love
In this K-pop dream, you're a snubber, sway, oh-oh
Dance until day
Our hearts they beat day
Play you a sweet replay
It's pop, it's our ballet
In the city where dreams never sway
Under the moon we'll sway, we'll dance until day
Our hearts as DJ playing love's sweet replay
