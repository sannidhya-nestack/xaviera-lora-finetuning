Not even the start of night necessarily so bright
Soul's heartbeats echo breaking the quiet
Hidden stories waiting to be told
Under the moonlight we grow bold
Dancing in the soul
Dreams
With the music we find our ease
In a city where dreams take flight
Underneath the shimmering city light
Do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Streets bathed in neon glow tell a tale
Of love and dreams and an endless trail
On soul stage where everyone's a star
Finding our rhythm no matter where we are
Swirling in the soul wind
Tell us melody or end
In a city that feels so right
Under the counter this whole night
In the heart of soul a heart beats a line
With every note with every rhyme
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
