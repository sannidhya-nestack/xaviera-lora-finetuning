In the middle of the city, I'm walking, delivering all the lines, painting stories that quest for freedom in this lonely room, I found my solace, with my passion and praise, I'm chasing my own way set
Can you hear my heartbeat is beating for you?
I'm lost in your melody and every single tune
Catch my breath, catch my whisper
In this chorus of life, let's dance together
Underneath the skyline amidst a million stars
Finding the rhythm between all the bars
With the music so loud, yet it's you that I hear
Under this kaleidoscope our song is clear
Can you feel the rhythm it's calling you
In this endless harmony let's paint a hue
Hold my hand, be my rhythm
In this symphony of dreams let's dance to its rhythm
Can you hear when he fades in the glow of the dawn?
Our rhythm stays unbroken, unbound and unashorn
With your hand in mine, close your eyes, take a leap
In this ballad of life, we'll dance, we'll reap
Can you hear my heartbeat? It's beating for you
I'm lost in your melody and every single tune
Catch my breath, catch my last breath
In this chorus of light, let's dance together
Under it, the skyline emits two million stars
Finding the rhythm of the far-sweeping whispers of the night
The melodies take over, echoing in unison
Under the neon lights, left are the neon lights
So can you feel the rhythms calling you?
In this endless harmony, let's paint a hue
Hold my hand, be my rhythm
In the symphony of dreams, let's dance till we're sleeping
Underneath the city sky, a sea of twigs and stars
We find the rhythm of our hearts in the whispers of the night
The melodies take over, echoing in unison
Under the neon lights, our dance has just begun
So can you feel it, the rhythm inside?
Our secret harmony under the city lights
In the whispers of the wind, or the urban bloom
Our song of dreams in every mood
In this shifting world, our hearts remain steady
Together we stand, together we are ready
In the sound of the night, our secret is kept
With every beat, with every step
As the moon dims and the sun begins to rise
Together we stand under the morning sky
Our song may end but our dreams live on
In this symphony of dreams we have just begun
In the snow lands and the sun begins to rise together we stand under the morning sun
