Painting pictures in the omelettes
Memories touching supper
Of laughter shared in tears we cry
In the gallery of our lives they reside
In a movie of days gone by
Sunsets and dawns in the skies
Moment of rain, feeling you in the thrill of life
Me and you
Scenes of love, scenes of joy
In the story of our life
Finger highs and lows, and then we tap the street of scenes we've seen
Sunrise, whispers of new days start
In the canvas of our heart
Scenes of joy and shadows of fear in this symphony of fears
Footsteps that echo in the past
Moments too beautiful to last
Each scene, a chapter
Each chapter, a tip
In this journey we set sail
Scenes of love, scenes that shine
In the story of our life
Through the highs and lows we've been
In the tapestry of scenes we've seen
In the sounds of the night
In the glow of the moonlight
Scenes replay, memories stay
In the heart where they sway
Footsteps echo in the past
Moments too beautiful to last
Each scene a chapter
Each chapter a tear
In this journey we set sail
Set go in the past
Moments too beautiful to last
Each scene a chapter
Each chapter a tear
In this journey we set sail
Scenes of love, scenes of joy
In the story of our life
Through the highs and lows we've been
In the tapestry of scenes we've seen
In the suns of the night
In the glow of the moonlight
Scenes replay, memories stay
In the heart-beat they sway
Footsteps echo in the past moments
Too beautiful to last
