Neon lights, city night, these all can be old
Walking alone but I'm missing you
Hearts in my throat as I move with the crowd
In the sea of faces, yours was the one I found
This is my song by Korean Pop
A love story that doesn't need to stop
Memories of us resounding in each line
Wondering if you still feel this heart of mine
This is my song, my Korean pop
A love story that doesn't need to stop
Memories of us resounding in each line
Wondering if you still feel this heart of mine
Your laughter echoes in hints of the breeze
Dances with the leaves and flows with the seas
I'm caught in the rhythm, it's you that I miss
Caught in the melee of our last kiss
This is my song, my Korean pop
A tale of love that I'll never drop
In every lyric I tell a story
A tale of dreams, love and shared glory
As I end this song under the starlit dome
Every note carries my heart back home
This is my song, my Korean serenade
A testament of love that will never fade
