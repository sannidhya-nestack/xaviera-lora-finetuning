Whether I'm home or out on the town
Serious or clowning around (round)
Doesn't matter what I do
Don't want no one beside me, besides you
Hey, OMG, what's your ETA?
I need your love ASAP
OMG, what's your ETA?
Giddy up, don't be (mm-hmm) lazy (yeah)
Don't think it's fair, fair to me (no, no, no)
You're living in my heart, rent-free (hey, up)
You think I'm fine, but let it show
If you wanna be mine, say, say it, ditto (hey)
OMG, what's your ETA?
I need your love ASAP
OMG, what's your ETA?
Giddy up, don't be, don't do it, lazy
When we're apart, apart of me
Feels so empty (feels so empty)
How the life is just showing up
Come and get your loving cup
When we're apart
A part of me feels so empty
So empty
Oh, OMG, what's your ETA?
Watchin' the waves, tattoo the driftwood
Scattered on the beach (scattered)
Dreamin' this way does me no good
When you're out of reach (When you're out of reach)
OMG what's your ETA?
I need your love ASAP (ASAP)
OMG what's your ETA?
Giddy up don't be so lazy (let's go)
OMG what's your ETA?
I need your love ASAP
OMG, what's your ETA?
Giddy up, don't be so (don't do it) lazy
