Under the neon lights, our soul, we dance
Hand in hand, lost in love's trance
In the rhythm of the city, heartbeat to beat
In your eyes, I found a love so sweet
Chasing stars under the salty sky
Feeling high enough we can both fly
In your smile I found the serenity
In the heart of Seoul it's our own city
Through city whispers and moonlight dreams
In every corner love redeems
The laughter echoes in the bustling street
In the city of love we're complete
Chasing stars into the soul setting sky
Feeling high in love we can both fly
In your smile I find the serenity
In the heart of soul it's our own city
Through state of whispers
Of moonlight dreams
In every corner love redeems
Your laughter echoes in the bustling street
In the city of love we're complete
Chasing stars into the soul city sky
Feeling high enough we can both fly
In your smile I find my serenity
In the heart of soul it's our own city
The night sky twinkles reflecting in your eyes
In soul city where our love lies
In the warmth of your embrace so tender
In soul city where love is our surrender
