In Seoul city, under the neon lights
We walk hand in hand, through the starry nights
With the moon as our spotlight, in this lively crowd
Our love story whispers, yet it echoes loud
In the heart of Korea, where dreams intertwine
Every glance you steal, I wish to make it mine
With the rhythm of the night, and the melody so sweet
Our beating hearts and soul, make a perfect beat
Through the bustling markets
To the silent streams
In the city of dreams
We're weaving our dreams
Every laugh every touch
With you feels so right
In Seoul city
Our love shines so bright
In the heart of Korea
Where dreams intertwine
I've regrets you steal
I wish to make it mine
With the rhythm of the night
And the melody so sweet
Our beating hearts and soul
Make a perfect beat
As the sun sets on Seoul's towering skyline
Your love, your warmth, is forever mine
In this city of lights, under the moon so clear
Our love echoes in Seoul for all to hear
Oh, cry for me, cry for me, oh baby
As the sun sets on Sol's towering skyline
Your love, your warmth is forever mine
In the city of lights under the moon so clear
I love echoes and soul for all to hear
Oh, govee, I'm so sorry
Govee, as the sun sets
