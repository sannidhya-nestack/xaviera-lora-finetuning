Under the crystal sky, we dream our days away
In your eyes, I'll find my stay in this night
We'll sway by the shore where waves kiss the land
Together we'll stand hand in hand painting our destiny
With the strokes of love flying high above
We're joined by the stars above
Echoing our laughter in this life ever after
Your touch, a tender breeze puts my heart at ease
Through every season, love will be our reason
Paths intertwine, our spirits align
We'll break the confines, creating our own signs
In this chapter written by our hearts
Nothing can pull us apart with our love as our
And as the night fades, we'll greet the new light
Stronger than ever, ready for the fight
You'll love my haven in the endless sea
We'll write our legacy for all eternity
This life of waves crystalline together we'll stand
Hand in hand painting our destiny
With the strokes of love flying high above
We're joined by the stars above
Echoing our laughter in this life ever after
Your touch, a touch, a tender breeze
Brings my heart at ease
Through every season love will be our reason
Paths intertwine, our spirits align
We'll break the confines, creating our own signs
In this chapter, written by our hearts
Nothing can pull us apart, with our love as art
And as the night fades, we'll greet the new light
Stronger than ever, ready for the fight
Your love my haven in the endless sea
We'll write our legacy for all eternity
