Can you smell the blood running through my veins?
Cause I already know the taste of your pain
I dream of you whenever I'm not with you
I dream of you whenever I'm not with you
The dust has settled now, you know it's not too late
Yeah you can bite my skin but I won't break
Come in for me
I'm not alone
Moon is down
Moon is down
You tell me that you love me, I believe it
You tell me that you love me, I believe
(audience laughing)
Put something in me
Since this isn't good
But something in me says this isn't good
Everything must fade
Everything must fade
Can you smell the blood running through my veins?
Cause I already know the taste of your pain
You tell me that you love me, I believe it
You tell me that you love me
I believe it
Everything must fade
Everything must fail
It's something in me
Says this isn't good
But something in me says this isn't good
The dust has settled now, you know it's not too late
Yeah, you can bite my skin but I won't break
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-woah
Come in for me
