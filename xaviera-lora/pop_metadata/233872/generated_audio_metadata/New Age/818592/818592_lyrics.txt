Alright, just relax, put your arm down, just rest it comfortably, just lean back
Just be very comfortable and relaxed, trust me, okay?
Close your eyes
Now, just listen for a moment
Listen to the sounds of the room around you
Sleep
Kill your dreams before they take over your life
Throw away your plans and make the dive
Into the pool of light
It's the absence of the night
If I never went to sleep, it would be so hard to keep
My eyes open so I won't see
What is going on outside
I am way too weak to fight
Through the looking glass into the wishing well
Fill your cup drink it up and kiss but never tell
When you're ill take your pill but are you really
Can you answer to the question how you're feeling?
If I never went to sleep it would be so hard to keep
My eyes open so I won't see
What is going on outside
I am way too weak to fight
