What you need
Will be alright
Calling for you and here I am
Calling for you, calling for you
Longing for you where I stand
Longing for you, longing for you
Thinking of you, my true love
Thinking of you
Thinking of you, dreaming of you and what you need
Dreaming of you, dreaming of you
I know it will take some time
Are here in my mind
We will be here soon, my love
Loving you so, in my heart
Loving you so (loving you so)
Loving you so (loving you so)
Flowers from here to the far
I send them to you, wherever you are
My sun will shine when you are home
The sun in my home, soon you are home
My strength and my eyes will be alright
You are my light
Yes, you're my light
I know it will take some time (take some time)
You are here in my mind (in my mind)
We will be here soon, my love
I know it will take some time (take some time)
You are here in my mind (in my mind)
We will be here soon, my love (my love)
My love
