Allow your crown to breathe
And gently invite in a light violet
Softly bathing your crown
Balancing
Restoring
Harmonizing
Let your crown take what it needs
And say the words
I am one with the universe
I am one with the whole
When you are ready
Come back to yourself as a whole
Back to the ebb and flow of your breath
Back to your center.
Breathe into your core
And say the words
I am whole
I am perfect just as I am
Say the words
Am whole
I am perfect just as I am
Allow the energy of the words to bathe your body
Your mind
Your emotions
And your spirit
And take what you need
And in your own time, become aware of the air on the surface of your body,
The sounds around you, near and in the distance.
Close your chakras down a little.
Become aware of the support beneath you.
Notice how you feel.
And hold yourself with loving kindness for the beautiful.
Unique being that you are
And hold yourself with loving and kindness
For the beautiful, unique being that you are
When you are ready, you can draw this meditation to a close.
