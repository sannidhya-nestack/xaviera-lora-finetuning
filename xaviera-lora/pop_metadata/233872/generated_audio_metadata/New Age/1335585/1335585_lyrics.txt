Close your eyes, take a deep breath in and gently exhale.
Now imagine your future healthy self standing before you.
They're standing right in front of you.
Strong, radiant and glowing with vibrant energy
This is you
Fully alive, aligned and well
What colour surrounds this future you?
Let that colour shimmer and glow
Now gently invite this colour, this energy to float towards you.
Let it move into your body,
flowing through your chest, your spine, your hands, your heart.
Feel this colour merging with you.
This future self becoming part of you
This is your guidance
This is you
Let this light carry you forward. 10, 20, 30, 40, even 50 years into the future, even 60 years into the future. See yourself thriving. Feel yourself walking forward with strength, ease and grace.
Now imagine your actions today can create ripples into the future
Each kind choice, each moment of love
Sending waves into the universe You are creating good karma
Every breath is a chance to choose again
to bring more light into your life and into the world. Take a deep breath in and a deep
breath out and come back to the room. Welcome back.
