Are you a dignified goddess, aloof and calmly observing our plight from some higher plane
where there are no questions anymore?
Or perhaps you are a cold and cruel entity, faintly amused but ultimately indifferent
Do you laugh at our attempts to tame you, Define you with start, middle and end?
Measure you by our own fleeting existence While we enslave ourselves to you?
We create our gods and spirits and ghosts To fear and worship, revere, fight wars over and die for
But it is you we fear the most
You are the bringer of life and death
Presenting fate with the same inevitability as day and night
La la la la
We see you in the rising and setting sun
Feel you in the changing seasons, hear you in life's symphony.
You are a gentle and subtle healer, an alchemist, turning pain into wisdom, fear into understanding,
and anger into acceptance with the bittersweet gift of hindsight.
And you are madness incarnate, the destroyer
Slowly taking splendid beauty
And replacing it with decay and erosion
And all the time we wait for you
Holding on to our memories of the future
And singing our laments for the past
You slip through our fingers like sand
And we wait for you
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
And when we et you, you wait patiently for us
