Beautiful is the morning it shines
And bright are the stars in the sky
Whispering voices still of the night
They sing of a love meant for you and I
Crystal water, ocean splash of blue
They capture a tone
Only shared with you
Mother Earth blesses, oh gift of life
So sweet is the breath, breathe with me tonight
