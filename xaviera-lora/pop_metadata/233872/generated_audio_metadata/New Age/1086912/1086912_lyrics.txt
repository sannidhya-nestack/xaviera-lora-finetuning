Good evening ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to the hottest show in town
Are you having a good time?
Rock and roll baby, rock and roll
Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to introduce you to the latest in rock'n'roll sensations
Are you having a good time? Rock'n'roll baby, rock'n'roll
Give a big warm welcome for the fabulous, incredible, sensational Seven Spiders
Now your life becomes so ruthless that love can't find a place
And your only real emotions are jealousy and hate
Does your heart hang heavy on the gallows of our time
Swinging like the evil schemes that dominate your mind
Dance like a gangster, dejaboula crying
Dance until the sun rise
Are you having a good time?
Rock'n' roll, baby, rock'n' roll
Come on fool, I've got a bad feeling here
Come on fool, we gotta get out of here
Run, don't stop, don't even look back
The whole damn system's gonna have a heart attack
Dancing like a gangster, dejaboula crime
Hello, wake up, it's Armageddon time
Well never mind the decadence that vanity relates
So you paid some greedy doctor to manipulate your face
And you think you look so young and you feel so fancy free
When you're gonna give back the things you took from me
Dance like a gangster, déjà vu, le crime
Dance until the sun rises
Come on fool, I've got a bad feeling here
Come on fool, we've gotta get out of here
Run, don't stop, don't even look back
Old damn system's gonna have a heart attack
Dancing like a gangster
Déjà vu, love crying
Hello, wake up, it's Armageddon time
There's nothing you can do now to save your dignity
Because you're underworked and overpaid
And don't deserve the raise you gave yourself
And no one else
Does your conscience battle with your pompous self-respect
And you dance like a gangster?
Déjà vu, la crime
Dance until the sunrise
Come on fool, I've got a bad feeling here
Come on fool, we've gotta get out of here
Run, don't stop, don't even look back
The whole damn system's gonna have a heart attack
Dancing like a gangster, deja vu like rhyme
Hello, wake up, it's Armageddon time
I'm gonna leave the city where the dogs eat dog
And the rats run races in the underground fog
Singing I can see the light at the end of the line
I can see you
Blinking at sunrise
While you're riding on a dead line
Got my wheels on a dream machine
You never see nothing so she can clean
She's the coolest, meanest, I agree
Riding on the deadline
Would you like to ride through life on a unicorn?
Would you like to ride with me on mine?
We're gonna run free from your city ways
If you're gonna look back then you'd better stay
We're gonna be the wild and the stormy sea
Spirit you away so we'll never be
Riding on a dead line
I just want a lover who looks so fine
Pretty young girl gonna waste my time
Gonna waste my time with a pretty young girl
Pretty young girl gonna waste my time
Gonna spend my cash and smoke my hash
We're gonna get high and drink some wine
She wants to ride naked on a motorbike
She says she wants to ride with me
She don't tease, she likes to please
She says she'll be my slave and all I've got to do
Is save her from the deadline
So we ride on the wind from the city streets
She don't rattle and she don't squeak
She purrs like a cat been gone all week
Up to some mischief
She tells me jokes and little white lies
Breaking hearts is a perfect crime
So if you're gonna die, laugh and get an alibi
I was riding on the deadline, your honor
Yes, I was riding on the deadline
Would you like to ride through life on a unicorn?
Would you like to ride with me on mine?
Sweet, life should be sweet
So sweet, free, we should be free
Free whatever that means
Free is what I want to be
Free I want to be
Free, we could be free
Free, and if I was free
Life, life would be sweet
So sweet
