Breathe into here.
Allowing your solar plexus to soften and expand on your breath.
And invite in the color yellow.
The color of sunshine.
Bathe your solar plexus with sunshine.
Replenishing, restoring, nurturing
Letting your solar plexus take what it needs
As you say the words, I value myself
I am enough
I am more than enough
I am worth my weight in gold
As you say the words, I value myself
I am enough
I am more than enough
I am worth my weight in gold
When you are ready, bring your awareness up to the center of your chest,
to your heart, your chakra of self-development and unconditional love.
