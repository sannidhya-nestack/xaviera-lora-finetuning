Breathe into your hara
Let it gently soften and expand on your breath
Taking in nourishment and life force energy
And invite in orange, the color of the setting sun
Bathe your hara with orange
Balancing, empowering, motivating
Let your hara be fed and say the words
I honor my needs
I allow myself to be nourished
Let's say it one more time out loud, just to center it in
I honor my needs
I allow myself to be nourished
And when you are ready, move your awareness up to the soft area below your breastbone.
To your solar plexus
Your chakra of personal power
