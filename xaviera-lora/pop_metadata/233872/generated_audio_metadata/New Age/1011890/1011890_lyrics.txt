Gently breathe into your heart
Letting it soften and expand on your breath
And invite in green
The color of spring
Or rose pink
Whichever feels right
Bathe your heart center with nourishment
Renewal
Let your heart take what it needs to say the words
I am greatly loved
I allow myself to give and receive love freely
I am nourished by the power of love
Say the words
I am greatly loved
I allow myself to give and receive love freely
I am nourished by the power of love
In your own time, move up to your neck.
to your throat, your chakra of self-expression and personal will.
