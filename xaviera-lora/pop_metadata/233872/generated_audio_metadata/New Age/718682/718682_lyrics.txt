When the day is done
And the flowers leave from the sun
I just wanna go back
Escape
I'm free
Is there reality somewhere
Is this just a dream
Or I can't see it
There's only two of us, please save me
Which way do you think we should go?
Breathe eternally
Breathe eternally
Breathe, it's fine
Please, it's your life
I'm free
Is there reality somewhere
Is this just a dream
Or I can't see it
There's only two of us, please, save me
Which way do you think we should go?
Escape
Come
Escape
Breathe eternally
