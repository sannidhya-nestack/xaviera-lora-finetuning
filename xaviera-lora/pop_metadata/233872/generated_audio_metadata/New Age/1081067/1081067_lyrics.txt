O, I die, Horatio!
Repultant poison quite o'ercrows my spirit
I cannot live to hear the news from England
But I do prophesy the election lights on Fortebras
He has my dying voice
So tell him, with the occurrence more and less which have solicited, the rest is silence.
I am in me
I am in me
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you
I know I'm your love
I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been there
I'm your love, I'm your love
I am now
Nothingness
I will come back
I'm your woman
Naya
I'm your woman
I'll know
No cracks her noble heart
Good night, sweet prince
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
