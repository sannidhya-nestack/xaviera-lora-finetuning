Gently breathe into your heart
Letting it soften and expand on your breath
And invite in green, the color of spring
Or rose pink, whichever feels right
Bathe your heart center with nourishment, renewal, and healing.
Let your heart take what it needs and say the words, "I am greatly loved.
I allow myself to give and receive love freely.
I am nourished by the power of love."
Let's say it one more time, out loud, just to center it in.
I am greatly loved.
I allow myself to give and receive love freely.
I am nourished by the power of love.
In your own time, move up to your neck, to your throat,
Your chakra of self-expression and personal will.
