Eat, drink all you will, relax, enjoy the turn
We will teach you to conform to what you learn
We control everything, except of course our greed
Our system is the rich enslave the weak
We buy your labour cheap
And make you work all week
Wine, women, song and dance, please queue at the door
Give them bread and circuses and they don't ask for more
Or what it's for, or why at all
Or where the money goes
In my pocket that's for sure
Cheap seats, fast food is all you can afford
I think the time has come to smoke that joint you rolled before
If you stay until the end you'll miss the last bus home
Just dance and drink and dance until it's closed
You have to make the most of what there is
I know I'm beats, wine, women, song and dance
Please queue at the door
Give them bread and circuses and they don't ask for more
Sex and drugs and rock and roll
Please queue at the door
Give them bread and circuses and they don't ask for more
Or what it's for
Or why at all
Or where the money goes
In my pocket, that's for sure
I love rock and roll, the rhythm of the fool
I love sex and drugs, I like dancing too
Get so hot in here, the groove is what we know
We dance all night and just et our woe
And if there is a cure
Play your rock and roll to me, we'll turn the lights down low
Give us bread and good TV, this life of sex and drugs is all we know
Play your rock and roll to me, we'll turn the lights down low
Give us bread and good TV, this life of sex and drugs is all we know
Turn the lights down low
And after all, we love to rock and roll
Turn the lights down low
We love to rock and roll, turn the lights down low
We love to rock and roll, turn the lights down low
Rock and roll, turn the lights down low
Rock and roll, rock and roll
It's a really good idea.
Hot dogs in a roll, relish on the side
Hot dogs in a roll, onions if you like
If you're gonna sell your soul you have to pay the price
So kiss me quick I'm service with a smile
Hot dogs in a roll, relish on the side
Hot dogs in a roll, onions if you like
If you're gonna sell your soul you have to pay the price
So kiss me quick I'm service with a smile
Smile is free
