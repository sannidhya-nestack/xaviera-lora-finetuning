Show me the path
Show me where the road's bent
I sit clearly inside your mind
You know how this day will end
Spirits won't be late
Through your own open eyes
Sensing the future
To you it's no surprise
I take your hands in my hand
I want to take this ride
You are the sorceress
You are the wizard
You are the visionary, the visionary, you are the visionary
You know the depths of my emotion
My undeniable devotion
You read into the darkness of my soul
Of my soul
I take a plunge into this ocean of blissfulness
Plunge into this ocean of stillness
My soul
Take me to that place inside your mind
Your alchemy will guide me through the stars
Through the stars
Take me to that place inside your mind
Your alchemy will guide me through the stars
Through the stars
I know I'm iven
I know I'm understood
I know I'm iven
I know I'm understood
You are the visionary, visionary
You are the visionary
You are the visionary, the visionary
You are the visionary
You are the visionary, the visionary
You are the visionary
You are the visionary, the visionary, you are the visionary
You are the visionary, the visionary, you are the visionary
You are the visionary, the visionary, you are the visionary
You are the visionary, the visionary, you are visionary
You are the visionary, the visionary, you are the visionary
You are the visionary, the visionary, you are the visionary
