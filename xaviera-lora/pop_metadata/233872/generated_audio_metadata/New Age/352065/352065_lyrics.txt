I'll be sending you a light when you need it
May this be your white light, may you feel it
When your hurts are in pain
When you're lost or ashamed
May this white light surround you
Keep you safe
May you be healthy
And may you be clean
May you be happy
And may you be free
All in all, may you hold this hand
And squeeze as hard as you want to
And when you're far away you'll understand
That I'll always be here for you
And I'll be sending you white light when you need it
May this be your white light, may you feel it
When your hurts are in pain
When you're lost or ashamed
May this white light surround you and keep you safe
May you continue to see the meaning
To make a connection
And feel your feelings
Hear the call of my compassion
Feel the warmth I am sending
May it be there to guide you
And lead you back to everything serene
I'll be sending you white light when you need it
May this be your white light, may you feel it
When you're hurt or in pain, when you're lost or ashamed
May this white light surround you and keep you safe
