Don't be afraid, my love
Of what you may hear or see
It's just me, setting sunlight free
And when you see dragonflies
When you feel peace
It's just me setting sunlight free
Don't et to call upon my love when you're feeling confused
And place in my hands whatever you can
To bless or quell for you
Don't be afraid my love
Of what you may hear or see
It's just me setting sunlight free
And when you see butterflies
Feel a slight breeze
It's just me setting sunlight free
There is more to love my love than all the broken things
Have faith in today let love lead the way to all that's meant for thee
When you see dragonflies, rainbows and butterflies
It's just me, setting sunlight free
Yes, it's me, sudden sunlight, free
Don't be afraid, my lovelies
