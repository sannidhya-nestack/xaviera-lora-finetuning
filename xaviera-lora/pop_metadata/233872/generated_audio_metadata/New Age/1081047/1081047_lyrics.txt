Take this kiss upon the brow
And, imparting from you now
Thus much, let me avow
You are not wrong who deem
That my days have been a dream
Yet, if hope has flown away
In a night or in a day
In a vision or in none
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream
I stand amid the roar of a surf-tormented shore
And I hold within my hand grains of the golden sand
How few, and yet how they creep through my fingers to the deep
While I weep, while I weep
Oh God, can I not grasp them with a tighter clasp?
Oh God, can I not save one from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream?
