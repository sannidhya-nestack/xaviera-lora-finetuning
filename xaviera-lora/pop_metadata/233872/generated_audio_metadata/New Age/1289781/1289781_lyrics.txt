Through storm and rain I walk on alone, couldn't ease the pain
Through dark of night
Reaching out for something
That would make it right
Then the tide turned
In your way
You brought me joy
Made me laugh again
When the dreamer
When the dreamer meets the dreamed
Through shadow fall
And the sight of nothing
No one at all
Through doubt and fear
Crying out for someone
To be always near
Then the sun
Rose shining on me
Restoring faith
Love is all I need
When the dreamers
Dreamer, when the dreamer meets the dreamed
Only the love that's in us
Only the love
Sees through the heart of darkness
Awakening divine sweet presence
I found myself inside a tomb
A softly shimmering aura surrounded a sarcophagus
The atmosphere was one of absolute peace and sanctity
The lid of the sarcophagus opened
A man, perfect and holy, lay as if he merely slept
And I knew someday he would reawaken
On his left hand he wore a ring with a large red stone in it
A voice deep inside me said, "Ooo-ah"
The parchment he holds to his breast contains the legacy of love
When the hill shall be split asunder and give up its find
He shall be seen to be whole, uncorrupted by time
And will change the world forever
And I cried out, "Are these the words I have waited so long to hear?"
So long that my mind has closed to miracles
And my heart has turned to stone, to stone, to stone, to stone, to stone
Dreamer, dreamer
Dreamer meets the dreamed
Dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer
Dreamer meets the dreamed
