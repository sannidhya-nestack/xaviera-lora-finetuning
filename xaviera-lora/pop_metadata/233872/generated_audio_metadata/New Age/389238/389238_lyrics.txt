Enter through me
Give me life divine
Giver of life divine
Enter through me
Learn what has been written
Enter
Breathe through me
Give with life divine
Give with life divine
Breathe through me
I live
And you
Giver of life
Primordial womb
I sing the song of what's been given
Of infinite wisdom
Celestial vision
Giver of light divine
Giver of life, divine
Giver of life, divine
Giver of life, divine
