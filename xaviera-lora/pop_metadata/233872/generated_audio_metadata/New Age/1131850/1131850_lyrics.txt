Since you came to stay here
Nothing has stayed the same
Are you in pain and peace in love
Did you find all the reasons to be near me
Since you say your praise here
Everything falls apart
But in my heart I keep my hope safe
This is the only thing that holds us apart
Time and time again
We build everything just the same
Wake up and start a manual old time friend
In the battle that gets lost more than once
