It's for myself that I walk alone beside the sea
Sleeping dawn will soon be rising
Time is still, in this moment I stand and I am free
There is hope on the horizon
Morning star shining on the time before the start
Stand alone till day begins
Morning star, far away
You're dancing in my heart
You're the song I love to sing
To feel the deep of the ocean
I walk the lonely shore
Early morning tide is turning
Here I am looking on
I wish it could be more
Reaching you would stop the yearning
Morning star, shining on the time before the start
Stand alone till day begins
Morning star
You're away, you're dancing in my heart, you're the song
