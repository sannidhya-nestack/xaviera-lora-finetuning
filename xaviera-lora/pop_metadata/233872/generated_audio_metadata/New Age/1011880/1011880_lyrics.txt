Allow your throat center to soften, expand, and breathe in.
Inviting in blue, the color of sky
Breathe sky into your throat center
Clearing, opening, softening the need for control
Freeing self expression and creativity
Let your throat take what it needs
And say the words
I hear and speak my truth
I express myself freely
I allow myself to go with the flow of life
Let's say these out loud
One more time
Just to center it in
I hear and speak my truth
I express myself freely
I allow myself to go with the flow of life
