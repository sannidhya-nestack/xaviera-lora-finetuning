When the last leaf falls from the oak's mighty limbs
Winter winds growl so we hurry on in
Store the harvest, stoke the fires high
Gather our forces for the long solstice night
the season, not just the day
Driving the demons of darkness away
Raise our spirits, raise in our hope
We'll summon the sun with a joyful noise
When the first lake drifts down from the sky
Mother Earth gathers her blanket of white
We huddle closer to keep ourselves warm
Telling the stories from ages before
'Tis the season, not just the day
Driving the demons of darkness away
Raise our spirits, raise in our voice
We'll summon the sun, summon the sun with a joyful noise
When the last gift's wrapped on this holy day eve
And you're weary and wondering what to believe
Go to the grove and ask the oak tree
What the holly, yule logs, and mistletoe mean
'Tis the season, not just the day
Driving the demons of darkness away
Raise our spirits, raising our voice
We'll summon the sun, summon the sun
Summon the sun with a joyful noise
