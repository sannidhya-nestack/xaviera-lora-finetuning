Angels are leaving, we're all alone
Haven't got a clue what I can do
And the lovers are worn down, hungry and slowly bleeding
People are crazy, out of their minds
Haven't got a clue what I can do
And it's only the awakened heart
Will stop the dying
And I'm praying, praying you'll come to the rescue
Saving the life'cause you have to
Praying that someone will hear us
People are dying, nature is too
Haven't got a clue what I can do
But I know that only love will stop the crying
People are crazy, out of their minds
Haven't got a clue what I can do
But it's only the awakened heart
Will stop the dying
And I'm praying, praying you'll come to the rescue
Saving the life'cause you have to
Praying that someone will hear us
And I'm praying, praying you'll come to the rescue
Saving the life'cause you have to
Praying that someone will hear us
Hey, hey
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Madness around us, prophecy now
Haven't got a clue what I can do
an angel sent this message for me to tell you
Angels are leaving and we're all alone
Haven't got a clue what I can do
So I'm running, I'm running, I'm running
And I'm still going there
And I'm praying, praying you'll come to the rescue
Saving the life'cause you have to
Praying that someone will hear us
And I'm praying, praying you'll come to the rescue
Saving the life'cause you have to
Praying that someone will hear us
And I'm praying, praying you'll come to the rescue
Saving my life'cause you have to
Praying that someone will hear us
Praying that someone will hear us
