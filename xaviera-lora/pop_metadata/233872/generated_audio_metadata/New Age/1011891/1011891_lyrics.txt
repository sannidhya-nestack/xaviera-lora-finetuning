Allow your eyes to comfortably close and come down into your breath, into your body, relaxing your belly, softening your mind.
Feel the support beneath you. Connect with the ground below.
Let it take your weight.
Become aware of the sounds around you.
Let them be there.
Notice the light and shade.
The air touching the surface of your body.
Sense the sky above and the horizons stretching all the way around you,
The earth below supporting you.
Allow your mind to empty what it no longer needs to hold onto.
Let it go.
Allow your body to release what it no longer needs to hold onto.
Let it go, flow out and away.
Draw yourself back from where you've been in your day.
Draw your energies back home to your center.
Ground yourself in this moment.
Begin to sense the space around you.
Breathe with the space and become aware of the rise and fall of your breath.
It's coming and going.
The sensation.
Sound, temperature, breeze down to where the weight of your body rests, below the base
of your spine, to your root, your chakra of belonging.
Breathe into your root. Let it soften and gently expand on your breath, taking in nourishment and life force energy.
Allow your root to connect down, down to ground below, deep into the earth and invite in the color red.
Empowering, embodying, grounding you in the here and now.
Let your root take what it needs and say the words, "I am here."
I have a right to be here, as I am.
The earth supports me.
When you're ready, allow your awareness to move up to your belly, just below your navel,
to your hara.
Your chakra of emotional intelligence, choice, creativity, movement, and pleasure.
