Take a deep breath in and a deep breath out. Close your eyes and take yourself away to a beautiful beach.
Sit on the golden sand and watch the waves lapping against the shore.
and connect to your karma.
See your karma as a colour around you,
extending out to all areas of your life.
Now imagine your actions, every single thing you do from now on creates a ripple.
See the ripple extending outwards.
Each kind choice, each moment of love sending waves into the universe, you are creating good karma. Every breath is a chance to choose again, to bring more light into your life and into the world.
Every choice is a chance to start again and bring in more light and kindness into the world.
Regain your karma. Create betterment for mankind.
Take a deep breath in and a deep breath out.
