Everything I am, everywhere I go
Everything I do is part of you
Everything I see, everyone I meet
Everything I feel is part of you
I feel your peace
Even in the middle of a busy street
When I am overcome with heartbreak and grief
When I am in my greatest need
Then I open my eyes for a glimpse
Of this miracle called love
And I know everything I am
Everywhere I go
Everything I do is part of you
Everything I see, every one of me
Everything I feel is part of you
I feel your love just as it is sent down from up above
When all my hope and faith in myself has gone
When I'm too tired to go on
Then I open my eyes for a glimpse
Of this miracle called love
And I know
Everything I am
Everywhere I go
Everything I do is part of you
Everything I see
Everyone I meet
Everything I feel is part of you
O Kiva Ammavya Niveya
Širti se sujuški
Tu e sivis, tu e sivis, tu
Mamo givenima spas, spas
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Everything I am
Everywhere I go
Everything I do is part of you
Everything I see, everyone I meet
Everything I feel is part of you
Everything I am, everywhere I go
Everything I do is part of you
Everything I see, everyone I meet
Everything I feel is part of you
