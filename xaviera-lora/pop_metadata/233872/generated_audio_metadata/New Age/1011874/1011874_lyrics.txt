Allow your crown to breathe
And gently invite in a light violet
Softly bathing your crown
Balancing
Restoring
Harmonizing
Let your crown take what it needs
And say the words
I am one with the universe
I am one with the whole
Let's say these again out loud
Just to center it in
I am one with the universe
I am one with the whole
When you are ready
Come back to yourself as a whole
Back to the ebb and flow of your breath
Back to your center
Breathe into your core
And say the words, "I am whole"
"I am perfect, just as I am"
"I love myself"
Let's say those words one more time, out loud
Just to center it in
I am whole, I am perfect just as I am, and I love myself.
Allow the energy of the words to bathe your body, mind, emotions, and spirit, and take
what you need.
And in your own time, become aware of the air on the surface of your body,
the sounds around you, near and in the distance.
Close your chakras down a little, coming back into your body.
Just having the intention is enough
Become aware of the support beneath you
Notice how you feel
And hold yourself with loving kindness
For the beautiful, unique being that you are
Focus in one more time on your breath, inhale and exhale.
When you are ready, you can draw this meditation to a close and slowly open your eyes.
