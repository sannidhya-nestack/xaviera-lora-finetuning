(Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out)
(So I'll be where you are) (So I'll be where you are)
(So I'll be where you are) (I'll be where you are, I'll be where you are)
(So I'll be where you are)
Where are you, where are you?
It won't show, it won't show, it won't show, it won't show, it won't show
When we leave what have we still got to hold on to? (When we leave what have we still got to hold on to?)
When we are ready to leave the world (When we are ready, when we are ready)
When we are ready to go (When we are ready, when we are ready)
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are
