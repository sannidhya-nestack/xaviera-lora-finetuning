Go home, go home to the mother heart
Go home and cry your fill
Then gaze round all around
At the morning fair and still
At the morning fair and still
Go home, go home
To your mother heart
Go home and cry your fill
Then gaze around, all around
At the morning fair and still
At the morning fair and still
Go home
Go home to the mother heart
Go home and cry your fill
Gaze round
All around at the morning fair and still
At the morning fair and still

Find the
Within, find the light within, shine
We would never choose to enter the underworld, never willingly, unless called to the task by the God of Transformation.
He is the God who presides over initiation and death.
He is the God who presides over initiation and death.
He wills that we face the night and walk for a time in his world of shadows
He wills that we face the night and walk for a time in his world of shadows
And the light they shone cast off a shadow
And the light they shone cast off a shadow
And the light they shone cast off a shadow
And the light they shone
The seven sacred centers of woman and man
Are the seven churches of woman and man
They are the seven chakras
Waiting to open to the will of heaven
As though they were lotus flowers
Blossoming in the radiance of the sun
But they are fastened, as with seven seals
Until love shall come, garbed in warrior dress
Whose word, like a two-edged sword, shall pierce the heart
And commence the opening of the seven seals
Five
And the seven sacred planets will shine forth the light of the seven rays
And the seven chakras shall open one by one
Archaic remnants sealed in the murky depths of unconsciousness
Shall spill out like plagues
Shall spill out like plagues
Shall spill out like plagues
Find the light within
Find the light within
When the battle is fought and won
The seven chakras shall become as seven kings
The kings shall be wise men and shall be the new rulers of woman and man's being
The inner kingdom shall grow green again
And rise up out of the charred ruins of destruction
And the awakened heart shall avert the apocalypse
And the awakened heart shall avert the apocalypse
And the light, they shone, cast off a shadow
And the light, they shone, cast off, a shadow
And the light, they shone, cast off
Those abandoned souls (They shone)
Those abandoned souls (A shadow and the light)
Crying out, crying out (They shone)
Crying out, crying out (A shadow and the light)
The rainbow sisters with their suffering (They shone)
The rainbow sisters with their suffering (A shadow and the light)
They shone (They shone)
They shone (They shone)
The rainbow sisters with their suffering (A shadow and the light)
