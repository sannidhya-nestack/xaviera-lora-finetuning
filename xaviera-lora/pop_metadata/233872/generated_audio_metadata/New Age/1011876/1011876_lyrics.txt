Allow your eyes to comfortably close, and come down into your breath, into your body.
Relaxing your belly, softening your mind, feel the support beneath you.
Connect with the ground below, and let it take your weight.
Become aware of the sounds around you
Notice the light and the shade
The air touching the surface of your body
Sense the sky above
And the horizon stretching out all the way around you
The earth below supporting you
Allow your mind to empty what it no longer needs to hold on to
Let it go, flow out and away
Allow your body to release what it no longer needs to hold on to
Let it go, flow out and away
Draw yourself back from where you've been in your day
Draw your energies back home to your center
Ground yourself in this moment, here
Begin to sense the space around you
Breathe with the space
And become aware of the rise and fall of your breath
It's coming and going, the sensation, sound, temperature
Breathe down to where the weight of your body rests
Below the base of your spine, to your root
your chakra of belonging.
Breathe into your root.
Let it soften and gently expand on your breath,
taking in nourishment and life force energy.
Allow your root to connect down.
Down to ground below, deep into the earth.
And invite in the color of red, the color of the earth.
Bathe your root with red, empowering, embodying, grounding you in the here and now.
Let your root take what it needs
And say the words
I am here
I have a right to be here as I am
The earth supports me
Let's say that one more time out loud
Just to center it in
I am here
I have a right to be here as I am
The earth supports me
Allow your awareness to move up to your belly
Just below your navel
To your hara
Your chakra of emotional intelligence, choice, creativity, movement and pleasure.
