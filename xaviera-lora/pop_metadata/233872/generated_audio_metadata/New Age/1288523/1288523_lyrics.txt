There's a call so soft, so sweet, so clear
The inner sound I love to hear
Across the mountains in the night
All the walls behind my side
I'm merging, merging
Merging with your mind
I'm merging, merging, merging with your mind
There's a travelled road inside my mind
That's always there, not hard to find
Silent words that bless my night
Worlds of love be on my side
I'm merging, merging
Merging with your mind
Merging, merging, merging with your mind
There's a call so soft, so sweet, so clear
The inner sound I love to hear
Across the mountains in the night
All the walls behind my sight
I'm merging, merging
Merging with your mind
I'm merging, merging, merging with your mind
