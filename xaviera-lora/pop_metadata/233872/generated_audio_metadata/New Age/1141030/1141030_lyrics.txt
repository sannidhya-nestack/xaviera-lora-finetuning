[silence]
Deep breath
Here we are in my dream
Where I can be me
Where I do what I want with no guilt
I can't resist, it's so somber alone without you
Do you think I can't resist, it's so somber alone without you
Here we are in my dream
Working in me
Where I do what I want with no guilt
Do you think it matters?
It's so simple without you
Do you think?
Clear as zest
