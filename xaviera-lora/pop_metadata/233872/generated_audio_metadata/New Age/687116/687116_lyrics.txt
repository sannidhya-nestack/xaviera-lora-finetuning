Oh, I'm dying, dying, dying, dying, dying, dying, dying
(So, so, so, so, so, so, so)
Breezes blow in the trees
Leaves rustle, shaken by his fingers
He's walking in the garden
His downcast face bleeds with the tears
I'm not the party song, this is not our song, I'm not the party song, this is not our song
We said it's blue with the trees
Why'd you stall high?
Why dare you hide?
I'm not a party star
This is not a party star
I'm not a party star
This is not a party star
Why do you hide my love?
I know you have sinned
Now you must leave
For it breaks my heart
Another party's on
This is not our side
Another party's on
This is not our side
Another party's on
This is not our
This is not our time, this is not our time, this is not our time, this is not our time
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why
