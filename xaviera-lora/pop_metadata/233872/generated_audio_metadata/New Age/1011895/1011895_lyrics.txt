Allow your throat center to soften, expand, and b-r-e-a-t-h-e, inviting in blue, the color
of sky.
Breathe sky into your throat center, clearing, opening, softening the need for control,
freeing self-expression and creativity.
Let your throat take what it needs and say the words, "I hear and speak my truth."
I express myself freely
I allow myself to go with the flow of life
Let your throat take what it needs
Say the words
I hear and speak my truth
I express myself freely.
I allow myself to go with the flow of life.
When you are ready, take your focus up to your forehead.
between your eyebrows, to your third eye, your chakra of wisdom and intuition, gently
allowing it to soften, expand, and breathe.
