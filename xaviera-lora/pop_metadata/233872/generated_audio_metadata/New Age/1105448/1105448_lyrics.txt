Home
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh
The hand of Fwyn a danger, mean-robed into his shadows.
But even Fwyn most aglona seen her thyre well-tulle,
Where ye angora shines bright a clearer than olea before.
Istori sumin lend, vel tor sumis amen
Ai maito min swort shun peri ameth forevermore
Full of darkness and danger, we rode into the shadows
The stories of our journey will stay with us
And the might of our sword shall protect us forevermore
I will take thee, Amen, Bagbar
But even darkness must pass
And clearer than ever before
That will lead us back home
Ah sometimes I didn't adhere
None now in death
How could I am but glad
Back night air has ears
So lean for a cuddle bed
But in the mess
As only you are passing night
Home
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh ,oh ,oh
Ah sometimes I needn't a name now now in death
How could I have but blame back night air has here so lean for a cadaver
But in the earth has only you a passing that he could fear
Home
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh
