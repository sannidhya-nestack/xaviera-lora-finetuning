Whispers softly flow like echoes through the moonlit haze
Tender dreams that linger on, they dance within the space
Moments glisten intimately like runes by the fire's grace
Holding onto gentle sides we drift and drift away
In this quiet place with you
Every breath feels like a song
In this quiet place with you
Every moment we could spend
Silhouettes and shadows sway, they glide upon the breeze
Gentle rhythms pulse like waves beneath the tranquil sea
Guided by the stars, together we are free
In this quiet place with you
Every breath feels like a song
In this quiet place with you
'Cause love
Here in this moment, just you and I
Time stands still beneath the sky
Wrapped in warmth, lost no eyes
Forever living in the sight
In this quiet place with you
Every breath feels like a song
In this quiet place with you
Every moment lingers long
