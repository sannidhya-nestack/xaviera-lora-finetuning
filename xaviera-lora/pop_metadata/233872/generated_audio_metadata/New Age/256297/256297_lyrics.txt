Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
What if all seas were one sea?
What if all lands were one land?
Then every border would melt away
We might see a brighter day as one, one
What if all plans were one plan?
What if all dreams were one dream?
Then every hope would find a way
And we might see a brighter day as one, one
One heart, one mind
In time we'll find
We'll find where you are
What if all tears were one tear?
What if all sins were one sin?
Then compassion will set us free
And we might see we can be as one
One
One
One
