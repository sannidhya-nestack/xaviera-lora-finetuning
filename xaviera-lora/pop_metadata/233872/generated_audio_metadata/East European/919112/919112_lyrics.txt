I am a symbol for my bond
I am a symbol for my bond
Say ayo
Where are you?
Let it get good, let it get good
Let it get good, let it get good
I am a sumo, bone my bone, bone my bone, bone my bone
Dear Lord, don't say I am gone, I am gone, I am gone
I am a sumo, bone my bone, bone my bone, bone my bone
Dear Lord, don't say I am gone, I am gone, I am gone
Let's get the beam, let's get the beam
Let's get the beam, let's get the beam
I am missing you, on my phone, on my phone, on my phone
Dear, both don't say I am gone, I am gone, I am gone
I am missing you, on my phone, on my phone, on my phone
Dear, both don't say I am gone ,I am gone, I am gone
I am a sumo, bone my bone, bone my bone, bone my bone
Dear god, don't say I am done, I am done, I am done
I am a sumo, bone my bone, bone my bone, bone my bone
Dear god, don't say I am done ,I am done, I am done
