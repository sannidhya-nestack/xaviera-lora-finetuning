The laya
Brahmacharya
Kameshchari
Vaidya
Yes, there is in me
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Love is the love
There is nothing more
Than you in my heart
Ya me siro'o
Y es que si decí
Pa' esto anirá
Deba' ya decí
Pa' esto anirá
The young love yesterday
There is nothing more
Which we must do
We are messing it up
We are messing it up
We are messing it up
We are messing it up
