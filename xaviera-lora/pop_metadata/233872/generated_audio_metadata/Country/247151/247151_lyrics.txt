In high school you were the envy of all the guys
They dreamed of caressing your curves and turning you on
It was a boy like me who had the key to make you mine
I was so proud never thought about the day you'd be gone
But I understand now that I'm a man why we're moving on
Goodbye Josephine
I've got great memories
Of going down the road with you
Of being young and feeling free
You and me together
It felt like destiny
Oh it's so hard for me
To say goodbye Josephine
All the girls would say when we drove by on Friday nights
That you were too fast for me and way too smooth
They were secretly wishing they were you by my side
Giving all those girls craze
Teenage boys the blues
There'll never be another dreamboat like you
Goodbye Josephine
I've got great memories
Of going down the road with you
Of being young and feeling free
You and me together
It felt like destiny
Oh it's so hard for me
To say goodbye Josephine
I hate to leave you here in this idle yard
But your doors don't open and your engine don't start
I'll try not to cry when you get sold for parts
But think of our glory days and stay young at heart
Goodbye Josephine
I've got great memories
Of going down the road with you
Of being young and feeling free
You and me together
Oh it felt like destiny
Oh, it's so hard for me to say goodbye, Josephine
It's so hard for me to say goodbye, Josephines
It's so hard for me to say goodbye, Josephines
