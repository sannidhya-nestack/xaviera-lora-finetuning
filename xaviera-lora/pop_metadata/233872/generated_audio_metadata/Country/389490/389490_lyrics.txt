There's a story they tell in Rhode Island
a girl, a dog, and old car
An old bulldog named Charlie
The Mercedes couldn't go far
Now the girl and this bulldog were fighters
And a little bit down on their luck
But they found one another
And that was enough
There's a time in our lives when we're lost and we're lonely
There's a time in our lives when we need a friend
There's a time in our lives when the emptiness lingers
That's when she'd take Charlie and go riding around in her Benz
She thought of him as more than some creature
He understood every word that she spoke
A little old man in a fur coat, teeth were snaggled and broke
But to her he had the face of an angel
Came along when she needed it most
Cause it's tough when you've lost your first love and run out of hope
There's a time in our lives when we're lost and we're lonely
There's a time in our lives when we need a friend
There's a time in our lives when the emptiness lingers
That's when she'd take Charlie and go riding around in her bins
And she brought to that dog a new family
When once he was so badly abused
He got all the joy he could ask for
Love that was true
Now time has a way of bringing us full circle again
And even a bulldog can't fight a journey that ends
There's a time in our lives when we're lost and we're lonely
There's a time in our lives when we need a friend
There's a time in our lives when the emptiness lingers
That's when she'd take Charlie and go riding around in her Benz
That's when she'd take Charlie and go riding around in her Benz
