There were nights I wanted you
So much I couldn't see
I'd lie awake and wonder
If you ever wanted me
I'd close my eyes and picture you
Sometimes you'd seem so real
I tried to imagine
How good it would feel
I'm not dreaming anymore
You're lying in my arms and I can hold on tight
This time you're really here
And you won't disappear with the morning light
I can feel your beating heart
And tissue lips pressed to mine
This is the love that I was longing for
I'm not dreaming anymore
All the tender moments I've pictured in my mind
Couldn't hold a candle to what's coming true tonight
I look in deep into your eyes
I see without a doubt a love never ending
Starting right here and now
I'm not dreaming anymore
You're lying in my arms and I can't hold on tight
This time you're really here and you won't disappear with the morning
I can feel your beating heart
And taste your lips pressed to mine
This is the love that I was longing for
I'm not dreaming anymore
I'm not dreaming anymore
