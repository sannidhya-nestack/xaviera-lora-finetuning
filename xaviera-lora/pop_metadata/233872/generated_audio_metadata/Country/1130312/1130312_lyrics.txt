He's tall and slender, quick to open up
Every time he takes me out, I feel like I'm in love
Drunk on his touch, buzzing like a bee
His kisses taste like honey
Kinda love I like to drink
I'm drowned in my heartache
One sip at a time
I'm going to et you
Best way I could find
It's there when I call
And loves me'til the end
The bottom of the bottle seems to be my only friend
Took a trip to Long Island
And had myself a tea
Four roses later I got swept off my feet
Wash the pain down and buy another ride
I'm miserable, it's company in this lonesome town
And I'm drowning my heartache one sip at a time
I'm going to et you, that's the way I could fight
It's there when I call and loves me'til the end
The bottom of the bottle seems to be my only friend
Drowning my heartache
One sip at a time
I'm going to et you
That's the way I could fight
It's there when I call
It loves me'til the end
The bottom of the bottle seems to be my only friend
The bottom of the bottle seems to be my only friend
