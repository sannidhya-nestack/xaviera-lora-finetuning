I ain't got no one, I don't really care
Though it seems that love is everywhere
You see, over the years, one thing I've learned
If you ain't in love, you can't get burned
Love won't always cut you down, I don't disagree
But a heart that's torn to pieces is a heart that I don't need
This hombre'd rather live his life alone free of the blues
Content right here with a cold beer and no one to lose
I fell in it once, I knew I would
But I fell too deep for my own good
When it fell apart, I could have died
And I'd minded one damn bit, yeah man I cried
Love won't always cut you down, I don't disagree
But a heart that's torn to pieces is a heart that I don't need
It's sombre to rather live his life alone free of the blues
Content right here with a cold beer and no one to lose
I know I could change my mind and I won't rule it out
But I also know I'm good to go with the tears that don't cry now
Love won't always cut you down, I don't disagree
But a heart that's torn to pieces is a heart that I don't need
This hombre'd rather live his life alone, free of the blues
Content right here with a cold beer and no one to lose
No wonder lives
