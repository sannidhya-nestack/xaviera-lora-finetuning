It's him (it's him)
Made me et about you (you, you)
It's him (it's him)
Ain't a thing you can do (ain't a thing you can do)
You've been trippin' all around this town (whoa)
Make your leg music when the sun goes down (whoa)
Ain't it kinda funny how I never come around?
What you gonna do now?
It's him (it's him)
Made me et about you (you, you)
It's him (it's him)
Because your heart wasn't true (because your heart wasn't true)
And he calls me baby, says he loves my mind
He's what we girls all call a pretty good find
It's him (it's him) made me et about you (you, you)
It's him (it's him) making me feelin' brand new (making me feelin' brand new)
All those numbers in your little book (whoa)
Keep on fishing like a little hook (whoa)
Might never love or put you down with just one look
What you gonna do now?
Hey, yeah
Yes, he calls me baby
He says he loves my mind
What the ladies call a pretty good find
It's him, made me et about you
It's him, anything you can do
It's him, it's him, it's him, it's him
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
