She was always my best friend's good sister to me
All prickles and pigtails climbing up a tree
But the way she looks now she's hard to ignore
Baby's not a baby anymore
No baby's not a baby anymore
I've never met anyone with half her nerve
She's a tomboy who taught me how to throw a curve
And now that I know what curves are for
Baby's not a baby anymore
No, baby's not a baby anymore
She still has her freckles and licorice smile
She tells me that pigtails are coming back in style
She still throws tap drums and apple cores
But baby's not baby anymore
No, baby's not a baby anymore
Baby's not baby anymore, no
Baby's not baby anymore
She still has her freckles and licorice smile
She tells me that pigtails are coming back in style
She still from tantrums and apple cores
Baby's not baby anymore, no
Baby's not baby anymore
She's the first one to trick the wind into taking her kind
She's the last one you'd ever want to face in a fight
if you fight with her, she'll leave your heart sore
Baby's not a baby anymore
No, baby's not a baby anymore
Baby's not a baby anymore, yeah
Baby's not a baby
No one told me maybe
Baby's not a baby anymore
