All this overtime is wearing on me
Gotta take a couple days off this week
Ask the boss, he says, "Go ahead, make today your Friday"
Reach for my phone, scroll to the bottom, pull up the weather app
Hot damn they're calling for a beautiful forecast
And it's my Friday time to play end of the week no time to sleep
Tomorrow is my Saturday
Going to JD's lounge for ladies night dollar jello shooters up till nine
Gonna find me someone fine
Can't wait to get on my way
Cause it's my Friday
Driving home windows down cranking up Aldine
Got some time before I hit the night scene
Man I sure can get used to this early weekend thing
Called my buddy Bill said it's Miller time
Let's go out tonight
He said it's not my Friday but I got some time built up
So let's roll
Cause it's our Friday time to play
End of the week no time to sleep
Tomorrow is our Saturday
Going to JD's lounge for ladies night
Dollar Jello shooters up till nine
Gonna find us someone fine
Can't wait to get on our way
it's our Friday, yeah
Hey, it doesn't matter which day of the week it is
Gonna be my Friday for someone
Time to have some fun
Cause it's my Friday time to play
End of the week no time to sleep
Tomorrow is my Saturday
Going to JD's lounge for ladies
Nine dollar jello shooters up till nine
Gonna find me someone fine
Can't wait to get on my way
Can't wait to get on my way
Cause it's my Friday
