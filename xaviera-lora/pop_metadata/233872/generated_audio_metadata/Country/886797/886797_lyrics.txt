Crashed a party late Saturday night
Landed right in the middle of a real good time
Mixing and mangling and having a ball
Girls everywhere they were wall to wall
When she walked in the room lit up
Turn out the lights this boy's in love
She was a knock down knock out
The kind of girl I always dreamed about
It only took one look to see she's out of this world
She's a head turning eye popping
Knock'em dead hard, stop'em
No need to look twice, love at first sight kinda girl
I took a deep breath and walked up to her
Tried to talk but my tongue wouldn't work
She read my mind as she took my hand
Next thing I knew we were in a slow dance
I opened my eyes we were all alone
Everybody but us had up and gone home
She was a knock down knock out
The kind of girl I always dreamed about
It only took one look to see she's out of this world
She's a head turning eye popping
Now I come dead hard stopping
I don't need to look twice
Love at first sight kinda girl
I didn't plan to fall in love this way
But with a girl like her
One look is all it takes
She was a knock down knock out
The kinda girl I always dreamed about
It only took one look to see
She's out of this world
She's a head turnin', eye poppin'
Knock'em dead, heart stoppin'
No need to look twice, love at first sight kinda girl
No need to look twice, love at first sight kinda girl
