She's country, sweet country
She's country as cornbread and sweet as cherry wine
Ways to pray on Sundays and not drink alcohol
Likes to hold hands and gets down to good old rock and roll
She's down home and homegrown, has weeks of southern drawl
Has faith in her country and that she'd stay home
She's country, sweet country
She's country as cornbread, sweet as cherry wine
She's country as cornbread
Country as cornbread
Her boyfriend's a marine from up in Arkansas
A true blue and she knew he'd love her ever more
They'll get married next summer before he goes to war
He's got faith in his country, his country to the core
That country, sweet country
That country has cornbread, sweet as cherry wine
That country, sweet country
That country has cornbread, sweet as cherry wine
