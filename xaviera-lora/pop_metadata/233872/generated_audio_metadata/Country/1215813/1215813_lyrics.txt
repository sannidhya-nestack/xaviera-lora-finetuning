I know, I know, I know, I know we ain't perfect
You're the best thing I ever had but it ain't working
If there was a magic pill I knew could heal this hurt
I would drop a cup of milk
Break the ice in my head
You see diamonds, I see red
And you say I'm never home
But you signed up when I was gone
You tried to change me, I'm still the same me
Silver just can't be gone
We go, we go, we go, we go round in circles
My mama said, "Honey, you shouldn't been jumping hurdles"
Love ain't supposed to be this hard
Though once we start driving us apart
Break the ice in my hand
You see diamonds, I see red
And you say I'm never home
But you signed up when I was gone
You try to change me, I'm still the same me
Silver just can't be gold
You should know better, we can't be together
Silver just can't be gold
You can bring me sugar babe
We know how it's gonna taste
Even though I'll bend and break
Still don't mean I'm gonna stay
Can't convince my heart to feel
Something that ain't real
You try to change me, I'm still the same me
You don't believe me, stupid it's carry game
You see diamonds, I see red and you say I'm never home
But you signed up when I was gone
You try to change me, I'm still the same me
Silver just can't beat gold
You should know better, we can't be together
Silver just can't beat gold
You try to change me, I'm still the same me
Silver just can't beat gold
