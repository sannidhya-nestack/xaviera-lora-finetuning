Blue skies, I want blue skies
I want blue, blue skies over me
I want blue skies, I want blue skies
I want blue, blue skies over me
Hey, Mr. Weatherman, please make her understand
That I don't want another rainy day today
I want blue skies, I want blue skies
I want blue, blue skies over me
I want blue skies, I want blue skies
I want blue, blue skies over me
Her mood can still intrude on a beautiful sunny day
But it's not gonna get stormy and grey today
I want blue skies
I want blue skies
I want blue, blue skies over me
I want
Blue skies I want, blue skies I want
Blue, blue skies over me
Life's complete and she's so sweet
With rainbows in her eyes
Her pretty smile could clear these cloudy skies
Surprise, I have blue skies
I have blue skies
I have blue, blue skies over me
I have blue skies, I have blue skies
I have blue, blue skies over me
Over me, over me
