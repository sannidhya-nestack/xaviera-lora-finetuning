Pick up the paper, it's all about gloomy economics
Turn on the TV, it's all about crazy politics
I'm so tired of it all
Steroids and sports, negative news reports
But when I give you a call
I come alive, no longer tired
And when I'm done with my nine to five
And when you give me the sign
With that look in your eye
You make me feel refreshed and alive
Don't even think of being tired
Driving down the highway
All I see is construction
Got the news today
There may be a job reduction
I'm so tired of it all
Gas prices up again, I'll make this all end
Time to give you a call
I come alive, no longer tired
And when I'm done with my night to buy
And when you give me the sign
With that look in your eyes
You make me feel refreshed and alive
Don't even think of being tired
Doing some fishing, a little golfing
Worn out from the sun
But when I give you a call
I come alive, no longer tired
And when I'm done with my nine to five
And when you give me the sign
With that look in your eye
You make me feel refreshed and alive
Don't even think of being tired
No, I don't even think of being tired
