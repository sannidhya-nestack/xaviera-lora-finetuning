There's a Tiffany lamp in the window
Next to the overstuffed chair
Velvet curtains blowing around
Children running upstairs
Pumpkin pie and cinnamon
Like sweet memories fill the air
Decorations cover the living room with Mama's special flair
And another November passes by
Another Christmas, New Year's, Fourth of July
Time to move forward, but I just sigh
There's an autumn colored rainbow hanging in the sky
I look outside at the porch sway
Then take a walk all alone
Yellow leaves dance around me
A soft wind whispers and moans
The chill in the air makes me shiver
As I turn around for home
Back to the warmth of familiar faces
The ones I've always known
And another November passes by
Another Christmas, New Year's, Fourth of July
Time to move forward, but I just sigh
There's an autumn colored rainbow hanging in the sky
Watching through the frosted glass
From the outside looking in
The harvest moon laps and stares at me as I reminisce again
And another November passes by
Another Christmas, New Year's, Fourth of July
Time to move forward but I just sigh
There's an autumn colored rainbow hanging in the sky
There's an autumn colored rainbow hanging
In the sky
