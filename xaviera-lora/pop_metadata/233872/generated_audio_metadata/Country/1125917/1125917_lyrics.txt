Yeah I hear you, I see it going round again
This time you're the one that got singled out
And it hurts me seeing such a good friend
Be the one that feels so down
Just keep walking there's some light up ahead
That's the way it always goes
It's the choice you make, it always is
You can sink or you can float
So go find sunshine
It's there to be embraced
And when you get a little closer
Let it warm your face
You can overcome the darkness
If you'll turn away
Into the light where it gets bright
Baby go find
The sunshine, plenty of people wanna feed that frown
When you're having a tough time
And keeping your hopes up ain't as easy as it sounds
Try to grab the good that's out there, it's your lifeline
Go find the sunshine, it's there to be embraced
And when you get a little closer, let it warm your face
You can overcome the darkness if you'll turn away
Into the light where it gets bright, baby go find
There's a light in this world that'll get you down
But there's a lot that'll get you down
Just don't stop where you are it comes back around
You gotta keep looking up when it all hits you
You gotta go find the sunshine
It's there to be embraced
And when you get a little closer
Let it warm your face
You can overcome the darkness
If you'll turn away
Into the light when it gets bright
Baby go find, go find the sunshine
It's there to be embraced
And when you get a little closer
Let it warm your face
You can overcome the darkness if you'll turn away
Into the light where it gets dark, baby go find
Into the light where it gets dark, baby go find
The sunshine
Go find the sunshine
Go find the sunshine
