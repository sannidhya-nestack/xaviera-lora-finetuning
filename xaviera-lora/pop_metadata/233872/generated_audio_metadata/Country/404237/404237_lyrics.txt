He's the all round country music burger man
He goes from town to town in a burger van
He sings a country song anyone can sing along
He's the all round country music burger man
He starts out at the warehouse every morning
Loading up his van with lots of fare
Then he hits the road while you're still yawning
He's selling lots of burgers everywhere
He's singing while he cooks his all beef patties
He yodels while he flips them through the air, yodel-ay-hee
He sings the lead guitar to mums and daddies
As long as they get burgers they don't care
He's the all round country music burger man
He goes from town to town in a burger van
He sings a country song anyone can sing along
He's the all round country music burger man
He takes burgers to the stadiums and sports grounds
Each burger's wrapped with expertise and care
But if there's country music then he'll be found
the music and the burgers are a pair
Then later in the night it's lots of coffee
And hot dogs and some extra dollars too
But all the while he's singing country music
This burger man is country through and through
He's the all round country music burger man
He goes from town to town in a burger van
He sings a country song, anyone can sing along
He's the all round country music burger man
He could be a country star they're saying
He sings with lots of country style and class
You should see the air guitar he's playing
That burger man just always cooks with gas
He is the all round country music burger man
He goes from town to town on a burger van
He sings a country song anyone can sing along
He is the all round country music burger
All round country music burger
All round country music burger man
