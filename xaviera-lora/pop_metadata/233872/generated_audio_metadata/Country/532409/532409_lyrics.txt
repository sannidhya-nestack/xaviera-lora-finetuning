We're having too much fun, getting nothing done
Sitting and soaking in the nice warm sun
Checkin' out the scenery and drinkin' a long cold one
Kickin' back, lovin' life, laughin' with all my friends on ride
We're hard at work and hardly workin' (hard at work and hardly workin')
Toughin' it out, there ain't no shirkin'
Toughin' it out, ain't no shirkin'
All week long, we told that line
When the weekend comes, it's party time
We're hard at work at hardly workin'
And puttin' in an overtime day
My team's in town
For an afternoon game
I got a pair of tickets
From old what's his name?
Missing this one
Would be crying shame
Gotta get there in time for the first pitch
Out in the bleachers with my catchers mid
We're hard at work at Hardly working hard at work at
Hard at workin'
Toughin' it out, there ain't no shirkin'
Toughin' it out, ain't no shirkin'
All week long, we told that line
When the weekend comes, it's party time
We're hard at work, at hardly workin'
And puttin' in an overtime day
Oh, let's go to work!
Yeah, work it out man
We're having too much fun
Getting nothing done
Up at a buddy's lake house
And out from under the gun
Fishin' and floatin'
Drinkin' a few cold ones
The grill is hot, the whole gang's here
We're fillin' up on dogs and beer
We're hard at work at hardly workin'
Hard at work at hardly workin'
Toughin' it out, there ain't no shirkin'
Toughin' it out, ain't no shirkin'
All week long, we toe that line
When the weekend comes, it's party time
We're hard at work and hardly workin'
And puttin' in an overtime day
All week long, we toe that line
When the weekend comes, it's party time
We're hard at work at hardly working
Oh, and we're putting in an overtime day
