Play me something I can dance to, mister
My baby loves it on the floor
Play me something I can dance to, mister
My future, it's lying at your door
One night I was working, club I'm not certain
A couple spun across the floor
Now she looked like a diamond
That man he'd been smiling
Every second he'd been inside the door
He said play me something I can dance to mister
My baby loves it on the floor
Play me something I can dance to mister
My future it's lying at your door
You can make it slow
You can make it fast
Make it long, make it last
Let me hold her good and tight
She's my dance floor baby for life
It was on a moonlit night, the stars shining bright
A Bill Monroe fantasy
Now love was in the air and you could tell by the stare
That's the way that they wanted it to be
He said play me something I can dance to mister
My baby loves it on the floor
Play me something I can dance to, mister
My future is lying at your door
You can make it slow, you can make it fast
Make it long, make it last
Let me hold her good and tight
She's my dance floor, baby, for life
