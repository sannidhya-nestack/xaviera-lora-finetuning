It felt so right, like it was all brand new
But after a while, it was déjà vu
There will always be thoughts
That never go away
There will always be words
We can never unsay
So here we are
Going down that same old road
Bringing up bad memories
That are left alone
I thought we could move past those lies and sins
Yet here we are saying goodbye again
There was joy
And there was love
But sometimes that isn't enough
It doesn't mean we won't always care
It means that the load was too great to bear
So here we are
Going down that same old road
Bringing up their memories
Better left alone
I thought we could move past
Those lies and sins
Yet here we are
Saying goodbye
We gave it our all, we tried our best
Now we can move on without any regrets
Too far apart, too close to be friends
So here we are, going down that same old road
Bringing up bad memories, better left alone
I thought we could move past those lies and sins
Yet here we are saying goodbye again
