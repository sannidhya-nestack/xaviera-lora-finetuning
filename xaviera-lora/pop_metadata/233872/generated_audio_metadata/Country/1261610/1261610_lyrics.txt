In times of deepest poverty
The wealth of life seems far from me
The sovereignty won't get to me'cause I play on
Or nations great do I defeat
Or locked in love and passion sweet
My smile reflects the joy of each as I play on
Play on, across the stratosphere
Play on, beneath the sea
Play on, my song goes anywhere
A song's the fruit for love and life so I play on
My days progress like notes in time
I know I'm wrong when I don't rhyme
And everything works out fine when I play on
If everyone were made to see
That life should be a melody
The harmonies would set them free when they play on
Play on, your tunes are numbered dear
Play on, no time for grief
Play on, you'll love the things you hear
A song will make the best of you when you play on
Play on and live a life in tune
Play on, you'll find it's free
Play on and love the way I do
I love to sing a song for you so I play on
I love to sing a song for you so I play on
Mm-hmm, play on
