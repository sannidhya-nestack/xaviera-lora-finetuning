Divided we stood, till united we fell
Deep into love's sweet wishing well
We both lived alone, in our own living hell
Divided we stood, till united we fell
You needed someone to have and to hold
Someone to feed the hunger in your soul
Someone who knows what it's like to love and lose
Someone who's no stranger to the blues
Divided we stood,'til united we fell
Deep into loss we'd wish and well
We both lived alone, in our own living hell
Divided we stood,'til united we fell
Just like a loner I kept to myself
Before I met you there was no one else
True love like yours is so very hard to find
It's rare as a snowflake in July
Divided we stood
united we fell
Deep into loss we'd wished and well
We both lived alone
In our own living hell
Divided we stood
united we fell
Divided we stood, to united we fell
Deep into love sweet wishing well
We both lived alone in our own living hell
Divided we stood, to united we fell
Divided we stood, to united we fell
