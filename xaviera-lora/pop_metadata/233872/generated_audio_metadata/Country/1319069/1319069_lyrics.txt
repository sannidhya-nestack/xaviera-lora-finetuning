I was only eighteen when I took the night train
Far away from everything, far away from you
I said goodbye to all my friends and all that made real sense
Travelled from east to west looking for a picket fence
I thought glory was on the outside
I thought true love was far away
I thought you had to fight to find it
I thought I couldn't stay
I searched the world for gold then turned around
To find it in my hometown
Found you in my hometown
Found it in my hometown
Found you in my hometown
They say there's no place like it
And home is where you hang your head
So say it's where your heart is
I had to leave to believe it
I thought glory was on the outside
I thought true love was far away
I thought you had to fight to find it
I thought I couldn't stay
I searched the world for gold
Then turned around
To find it in my hometown, I found it in my hometown
Found it in my hometown, I found it in my hometown
Sometimes the things you run from become the things that save your soul
You'll never know my broken heart because you made it whole
And I have no regret
No I wouldn't change a thing
life is one big circle
It ends where it began
I thought glory was only outside
I thought true love was far away
I thought you had to fight to find it
I thought I couldn't stay
I searched the world for gold
I searched the world for gold
Then turned around
I found it in my hometown (I found it in my hometown)
I found it in my hometown (I found it in my hometown)
I found it in my hometown (I found it my hometown)
I found it in my hometown (I found it, found it in my hometown)
