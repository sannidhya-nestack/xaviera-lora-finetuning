Hey Elvis, is that you?
Hey Elvis, please sing, don't be cruel
Outside of Memphis on a Saturday night in a karaoke bar
I was feeling kinda tight, night before a NASCAR race
Hey, that's what I do
I heard an angel's voice across the room
In a place like that I was really through
I turned my head and looked towards the stage
He had cold black hair, sideburns to match
A little chubby you could see was fat
He had an over-medicated look in his eye
Now later on he was on a break
By the jukebox doing an Elvis shake
I leaned over and whispered in his ear
Hey Elvis, is that you?
Hey Elvis, please sing don't be cruel
I don't blame you for stayin' under the grid
You look happier now
Now that your dead pay el-bus is at you
He said, "Hey, thank you son, thank you very much
For being kind enough to keep your mouth shut
Only you and a few truckers know for sure"
I've been match card drippin'
All goin' from town to town
And I love to see them little boys go round and round
Next set, son, this don't be cruel to judge for you
Hey Elvis, is that you?
Hey Elvis, please sing don't be cruel
I don't blame you for staying under the grid
You look happier now
Now that you're dead
Hey Elvis, is that you?
Hey Elvis, is that you?
