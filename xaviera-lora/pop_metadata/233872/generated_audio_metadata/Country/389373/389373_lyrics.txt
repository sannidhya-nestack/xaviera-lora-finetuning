I heard you talking all over town
You've been spreading your poison around
That's so damn sideways and a downright disgrace
If you got something to tell me, baby, it's in my face
You've been telling people that we're through
Well that's about the only thing that I've heard is true
Your brand of lying is like garsticking lace
If you got something to tell me baby
To my face
Why can't you leave well enough alone
You're bustin' up my heart now you're bustin' up my home
You're spreadin' garbage all over the place
If you got something to tell me baby, tell me to my face
I almost fell for you and all your bedroom lies
You almost had the world pulled over my eyes
I saw through all your tales, I see through your disguise
Why can't you leave me alone?
I know it's over, baby, that's not the question
Why are you messing with my reputation?
Our love affair's become a federal case
If you got something to tell me, baby, to my face
Why can't you leave well enough alone
You're bustin' up my heart now you're bustin' up my home
You're spreadin' garbage all over the place
If you got something to tell me baby, tell me to my face
You got something to tell me baby, to my face
