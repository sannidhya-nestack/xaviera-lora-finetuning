Don't know why I still love wild horses
Don't know why I just can't settle down
The only thing that I know is I'm restless
I'm gonna ride this old horse to another town
You gave me so many reasons to stay here
And I can give you one good reason I should go
You gave me all of the love I ever needed
What I'm gonna do right now will hurt us both
So wipe those tears from your eyes, don't say you love me
Say you won't miss me and I don't care if you lie
And I'll walk away without a damn thing to say
I've never gotten good at goodbye
The morning sun is rising in the east
My bags are packed, it's time to go
It's hard to say if I'll be back this way
I don't ever really know
Wipe those tears from your eyes
Don't say you love me
Say you won't miss me and I don't care if you lie
And I'll walk away without a damn thing to say
I've never gotten good at goodbye
I've never gotten good at goodbye
