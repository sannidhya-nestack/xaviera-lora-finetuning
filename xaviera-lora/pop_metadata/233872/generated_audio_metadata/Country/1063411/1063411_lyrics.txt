We call'em the good old days
When we ran free and wild'cross the borderland
Ooh, and that long lost place
He's now an 8x10 on your dresser's stand
But I remember well
When we used to drive fast
And we would love a store with good banks
When we knew it all
And we could fly like we never would fold
Before we got burned and died less years for love
Days too young to see
When we were invincible
No, and I don't feel sad
those memories wore me on a winter's night
And all of the love that we had
Was never really wrong but never really right
But oh, I never asked why
When we used to drive fast
And we would love as though it would last when we do it all
And we could fly like we never would fall
Before we got burned and our lessons were learned
Days too young to see when we were invincible
And though I'm older now I still know how to cross that line
It's just with a cautious mind
But oh well I couldn't die
Well I won't et
We used to drive fast
And we would love us though it would last
When we'd do it all
And we could fly like we never would fall
Before we got burned and our lessons were learned
Days to the undersea
When we were invincible
When we used to drive fast
