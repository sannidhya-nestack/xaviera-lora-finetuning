Pour my second cup of coffee as you read the morning paper
Think about unfinished dreams we said we'd get to later
Then you get up and reach for me, pass through me like a ghost
I close my eyes and feel the last time you held me close
I remember
What I've tried to et
How can I move on
When it's not over yet
My heart reminds me
Of the life we shared together
You're not really gone as long
As I remember
Well, my buddies call to tell me we're going out tonight
They say I need to move on, I guess I know they're right
But somewhere in the laughter I'll think about your smile
And I'll be there but somewhere else'cause every little while
I remember what I've tried to et
How can I move on if it's not over yet
My heart reminds me of the life we shared together
You're not really gone as long
As I remember what I've tried to et
How can I move on if it's not over yet
My heart reminds me of the life we shared together
You're not really gone as long
As I keep holding on
And I remember
