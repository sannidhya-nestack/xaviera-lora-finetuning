A yellow Whitney isn't a problem for me
I'll put your hands together if you tend to agree
Come on!
You want nothing to do with me
And I feel the same
Left your favorite shirt on my couch
What a shame
You play me like you play your little football game
But I'm the type of girl who's got to go her own way
Say L-O-N-E isn't a problem for me
I'm soaring solo
I'm soaring solo
I'm just fine, soaring solo
I'm flying free, I'm soaring solo
And living life for me
And mama don't approve of me
And I can't see why
Thinkin' that I'm messin' around with the heart of her guy
I'll be the first to say it, you know I
I can't deny the best thing that I ever said to you was goodbye
A-L-O-N-E isn't a problem for me
I'm soaring solo
I'm soaring solo
I'm just fine, so-and-so-o-o-o-o
I'm flying free, I'm so-and-so-o-o-o-o
And living life for me
Now my tailored boots and my vet
Are the only things I'll ever need
Living life with no regrets
Just me, myself and
(Let me spell it out for you)
A-L-O-N-E
Isn't a problem for me
Yeah, put your hands together girls
If you tend to agree
I'm so in solo
I'm sorry it's so low, I'm sorry it's so low, I'm sorry it's so low, yeah, yeah, whoa, I'm sorry it's so low
And flyin' free, I'm so in sorrow
And living life for me
