Here I am, look at me, living in the 21st century
I'm a woman, can't you see, I've come a long way, baby
I'm a single mom with a beautiful daughter
Working two jobs to keep my head above water
It ain't easy but I do it out of love
that's what I'm made of
I'm a 21st century girl
A 21st century girl
Half the population of the world
21st century girl
Yeah, I'm a woman, hear me roar
Shoutin' out words you never heard before
I can't cook, I don't clean
But I'll take a shot of Jim Beam
It's all about me taking care of my family
The head of the house don't have to be manly
I can be strong when the goin' gets rough
You don't wanna piss me off
I'm a 21st century girl, a 21st century girl
Half the population of the world is a 21st century girl
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh
21st century girl, 21st century girl
Half the population of the world is a 21st century girl
21st century girl
21st century girl
Half the population of the world is a 21st century girl
21st century girl
21st century girl
Half the population of the world is a 21st century girl
21st century girl
21st century girl
21st century girl
