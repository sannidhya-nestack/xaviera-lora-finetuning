When I was just past bubble gum
My dad and me out truckin' around
Stopped for lunch and spied this wallet layin'
Right there on the ground
A lot of money tucked down inside
And nobody else around
I asked Dad should we keep just a little
And he raised his eyebrow and he frowned
And said, ain't no right way to do what's wrong
A little or a lot it don't belong to you
If you wanna sleep good at night
There ain't no wrong way to do what's right
Years later met my wife at church
Bought a little house and settled down
Then one day a flirty neighbor well
She swayed up to me trouble bound
She winked and asked if I'd like a drink
Nobody else around
Said stay just a little while
And I heard my dad's words behind her smile
Ain't no right way to do what's wrong
A little or a lot she don't belong to you
If you wanna sleep good at night
There ain't no wrong way to do what's right
If you're looking on down the road
You could end up where you want to be
Sometimes the long, long road
Is the best way home
Ain't no right way to do what's wrong
A little or a lot, it's what belongs to you
If you wanna sleep good at night
There ain't no wrong way to do what's right
There ain't no wrong way to do what's right
