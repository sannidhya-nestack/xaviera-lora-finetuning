Love is good as gold, soothing for the soul
When you lose control of your emotions
Good times come and go, stop and smell the rose
Love is good as gold, that's all you need to know
Things don't always work
Feelings could get hurt
You gotta take a chance
Go ask someone to dance
If you want paradise
Grab your slice of life
Strike while the iron's hot
Give it your best shot
Love is good as gold
Soothing for the soul
When you lose control of your emotions
Good times come and go
Stop and smell the rose
Love is good as gold
That's all you need to know
Yes you take a risk
Just remember this
You gotta bare your heart
That's when forever starts
Love is good as gold
Soothing for the soul
When you lose control of your emotions
Good times come and go
Stop and smell the rose
Love is good as gold
That's all you need to know
All my hope was gone but I kept holding on
I found somebody now who I can't live without
Love is good as gold, soothing for the soul
When you lose control of your emotions
Good times come and go, stop and smell the rose
Love is good as gold, that's all you need to know
Things don't always work, feelings could get hurt
You gotta take a chance, go ask someone to dance
If you want paradise, just take my advice
Strike while the iron's hot, give it your best shot
Love is good as gold, soothing for the soul
When you lose control of your emotions
Good times come and go
Stop and smell the rose
Love is good as gold
That's all you need to know
Love is good as gold
Yeah
And love is good, good as gold
