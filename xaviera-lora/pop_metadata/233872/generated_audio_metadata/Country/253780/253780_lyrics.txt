You can go from an old dog, lazin' in the midday sun
To a pickup truck, kicking up dust on a long and lonesome highway
That you were born to run
You make a thousand miles a day look easy
And you always end up right where you belong
And through the times I looked at you and said you're crazy
You'd prove me wrong
Cause I know you're leaving
And I know what you'd say
So I'm not gonna ask you
Please won't you stay?
As we both met of our own convictions
There's no doubt
Yet there were times when even intuition and radar
Couldn't figure things out
While I gained a certain comfort in your presence
Seems like California's always called you home
But if Hotel G ia's any point of reference
We'll always build a bridge to get back home
I know you're leaving
And I know what you'd say
So I'm not gonna ask you
Please won't you stay
you know better than me what you're doing
And I won't stand in your way and have a good time
And you know better than me who you're fooling
I'll just sit and wait
I know you hear what I'm saying
Cause I know you're leaving
And I know what you'd say
So I'm not gonna ask you
Please won't you stay
Cause I know you're leaving
And I know what you'd say
So I'm not gonna ask you
Please won't you stay
No I'm not gonna ask you
No, I'm not gonna ask you
