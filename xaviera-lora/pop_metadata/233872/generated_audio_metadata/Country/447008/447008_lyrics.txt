They say good things come to those who wait
So maybe that means it's never too late
Standing in the rain
Give me a chance to explain
You say my love wasn't all for you
Maybe you're right, maybe that's true
I caused your pain
Just give me a chance to explain
I didn't mean to hurt you
I hated to see you cry
Our love then desert you
I really don't know why
My love was lost
But now it's found
And silence is often
Better than sound
But I will not refrain
So give me a chance to explain
I didn't want to hurt you
I hated to see you cry
I loved and deserved you
And I really don't know why
They say all's fair in love and war
That's just not me
No, not anymore
Please hear me, Jane
And give me a chance to explain
Give me a chance to explain
Give me a chance to explain
Give me a chance to explain
