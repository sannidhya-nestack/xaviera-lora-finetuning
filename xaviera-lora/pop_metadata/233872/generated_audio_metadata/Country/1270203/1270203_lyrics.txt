I'm sitting here with a beer and my bills in front of me
Writing checks to the ex, got to pay my alimony
It's Friday night and I think I'm gonna do what's right for me
Find a pretty country girl and light a bonfire on the beach
Let's live for the weekend
I don't wanna think about Monday at all
We could jump in the deep end
Take our blue jeans and shed them off
baby we know when Sunday's gone and the morning rolls along
It'll be the same old song (don't wanna hear that same old song)
Yeah, just the same old song (same old, same old, same old song)
Every morning they surely work me like a dog
My hands are hurting, back's bruised and I ain't feeling mighty strong
If I had my way I'd tell the boss farewell good luck so long
Take my pretty country girl and we can dance underneath the stars
Let's live for the weekend
I don't wanna think about Monday at all
We can jump in the deep end
Take our blue jeans and shed them off
Cause baby we know when Sunday's gone and the morning rolls along
It'll be the same old song
Don't wanna hear that same old song
Yeah just the same old song
Same old, same old, same old song
Well I don't know about you but I can do what I want
Had to get up early, drink coffee and then go punch the clock
If I had my way I'd sleep in and dream about being a star
Let's live for the weekend
I don't wanna think about Monday at all
We could jump in the deep end
Take our blue jeans and shed them all
Let's live for the weekend
Don't wanna think about next week at all
We could jump in the deep end
Take our blue jeans and kick them off
'Cause baby we know when Sunday's gone and the morning rolls along
It'll be the same old song (same old, same old, same old song)
You know, the same old song (don't wanna hear that same old song)
Yeah, it's gonna be the same old song (same old, same old, same old song)
Every day and every night it'll be the same old song (don't wanna hear that same old song)
You know, it'll be the same old song (same old, same old, same old song)
Be the same old song (don't wanna hear that same old song)
Yeah, just the same old song
Don't wanna hear that same old song
Same old song
Same old, same old, same old song
