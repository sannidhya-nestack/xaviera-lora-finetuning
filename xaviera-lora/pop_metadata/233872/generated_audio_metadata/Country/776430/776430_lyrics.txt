Oh here we go boys
She got the blue sundress and cowboy boots
Bent over the table shooting pool
That's what I'm talking about
I got my quarters lined up and I'm on deck
Grab a picture of Miller while she racked the set
That's what I'm talking about
Yeah, I'm just looking for some fun
I got my blue jeans with a skull ring
Tipping my head to the country queens
Cowboy rebel out on the scene
And things are getting loud
Bands playing my favorite song
All the guys and girls start to sing along
Everybody let me hear you shout
That's what I'm talking about
When she hit the 8 ball in and grabbed my pants
Said et this cutie come on let's dance
That's what I'm talking about
We're lit up by the neon blood sign
Double fisting sharks while we bump and grind
That's what I'm talking about
Yeah and we're shutting this place down
I got my blue jeans with a skull ring
Tipping my head to the country queens
Cowboy rebel out on the scene
And things are getting loud
Fans playing my favorite song
All the guys and girls start to sing along
Everybody let me hear ya shout
That's what I'm talking about
With no doubt
The beer is cold
The night is young
And we ain't stopping'til the sun comes up
I got my blue jeans with a skull ring
Tipping my hat to the country queens
Cowboy rebel out on the scene
And things are getting loud
Bands playin' my favorite song
All the guys and girls start to sing along
Everybody let me hear you shout
That's what I'm talkin' about
New jeans, school ring
Tippin' my hat to the country queens
Bands playin' my favorite song
All the guys and girls start to sing along
Everybody let me hear you shout
Everybody let me hear you shout
That's what I'm talking about
That's right son
