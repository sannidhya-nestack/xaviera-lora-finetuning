We faced each other knowing it was over
But neither one of us could say goodbye
We've held on for so long
Now we're letting go tonight
Leaving shattered dreams and promises behind
We kissed one last time, turned and walked away
Our lips felt the words we couldn't say
The finishing touch to love was a goodbye kiss
We're both giving up
All of us, it had to come to this
Our lips found a way to say enough
Our love ended with the finishing touch
Promises ago we felt the earth move
We kissed as though the night would never end
This goodbye is a far cry from where it all began
There's a trail of tears from here to where we've been
We started building walls to shield us from the pain
Our last kiss put the final brick in place
The finishing touch to love was a goodbye kiss
We've both given up
All of us, it had to come to this
Our lips found a way to say enough
Our love ended with
Finishing touch to love was a goodbye kiss
We're both giving up on us and had to come to this
We found a way to say enough
Our love ended with finishing touch
The finishing touch
The finishing touch
