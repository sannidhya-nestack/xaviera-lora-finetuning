When I first laid eyes upon her
She shot an arrow through my soul
There's no such thing as love at first sight
So I've been told
God has saved my reputation
Life's become a saddened song
I'm yearning just to be with her
They say that's how lonely's done
I think about her all the time
I hope she sees I might be in love
The way she smiles and looks at me
She was sent by the stars above
After all the conversation
When she told me she had fun
I went back to my empty room
that's how lonely's done
Oh, I see you're telling me you're in love with another man
I guess I'll have to be content to see you when I can
Feels so good when I'm around you
I'll catch your sweetness on the run
I'll never get to be with you
I guess that's how lonely's done
I long to put my arms around you girl
You know that's how lonely's done
