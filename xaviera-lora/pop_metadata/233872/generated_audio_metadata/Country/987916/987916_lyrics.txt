We've been sitting here all night, smiling smiles and making eyes
We've both been way too shy to take the chance
While the band is playing Sugar Moon, there's still room to change our tune
Let's face the music and dance
Darling, just between the two of us
If we hold on tight, we just might waltz right into love
There ain't nothing to it, just get out there and do it
Let's face the music and dance
What's going on is all too clear
Stranger things have happened here
Sometimes perfect strangers find romance
Just think of all that we would miss
If we passed up a chance like this
Let's face the music and dance
Darling just between the two of us
If we hold on tight we just might
Waltz right into love
Ain't nothing to it
Let's get out there and do it
Let's face the music and dance
Darling, just between the two of us
If we hold on tight, we just might waltz right into love
There ain't nothing to it, just get out there and do it, honey
Let's face the music and dance
There ain't nothing to it, let's get out there and do it
Let's face the music and dance
