Well I was born on a bus bound for Memphis
With the radio turned up high
Was delivered to this world'til the rhythm of the road
Keepin' perfect four-four time
My mama sang like an angel
My daddy played the mean guitar
Ruled the world in a travelin' show
Playin' Hungry Tongue cowboy bars
I learned to crawl and listen to Elvis
I learned to walk to Jerry Lee
I grew up rockin' the country
And that is where I'll always be
I'm just rockin' the country
Pluggin' it in, we'll play it fast and loose
I'm just rockin' the country
Hear the high low whistle and the rhythm and the music
Now the years flew by, got a band of my own
We play it hard, fast and sly
Got a rent on steel, blue on guitar
And the drummer's seen the world up high
Now we're kickin' buildings in Louis
We're jammin' down in Tennessee, yeah
We're still here rockin' the country
That's the way it's gonna be
I learned to crawl listening to Elvis
I learned to walk to Jerry Lee
I grew up rocking the country
And that is where I'll always be
I'm just rockin' the country
Pluggin' it in, play it fast and loose
I'm just rockin' the country
Hear the high low whistle and the rhythm I'm losing
My daughter was born west of Gainesville
In the back of our band tour bus
She looks wild and free just like a redneck
You know she looks a lot like us
She'll learn to crawl and listen to Elvish
She'll learn to watch the Jerry Lee
She's growing up and rocking the country
And that is where she'll always be
We're just rocking the country
We're just rocking the country
Oh, we're just rockin' country, oh yeah
We're just rockin' the country, yeah
Come on, rockin' the country, yeah
