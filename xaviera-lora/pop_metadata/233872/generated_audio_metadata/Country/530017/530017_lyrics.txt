It's amazing now, when you're not around
Even if it's just a day or two
My world feels upside down
you fill our home with warmth and hope
And when you're away there's an empty space
But I found a way to cope
I look at my left hand
And I touch that golden band
All at once you were in my mind and then my heart lifts up again
From that small circle of love
Such a perfect ring and it means everything
I thank the Lord who surrounds us with so much
For blessing you and me with our small circle of love
At first it was just us two, then our family grew
And with each new child God gave us
Our life felt so renewed
It means so much to me
That we all sit down to eat
Taking time to share our lives
And the thing I love to see
Is when a child of ours says grace
As we all hold hands and pray
Like spokes that give a wheel its strength
Together we're all giving thanks for our small circle of love
Such a perfect ring, and it means everything
I thank the Lord who surrounds us with so much
For blessing you and me and our family
With all we have together
Our small circle of love
Such a perfect ring and it means everything
I thank the Lord who surrounds us with so much
For blessing you and me and our family
With our small circle of love
You have a small circle of love
