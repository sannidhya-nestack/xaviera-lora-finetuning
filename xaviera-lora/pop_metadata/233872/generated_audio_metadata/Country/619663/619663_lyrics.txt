Back on a farm in Tennessee
Johnny met sweet Becky Lee
Poor Johnny got down on one knee
He said, "Becky, will you marry me?"
Oh, she said yes with just a smile
You could hear Johnny holler for a country mile
Johnny worked the fields both night and day
Planting corn and baling hay
Becking the plain as white and black
How to keep Johnny coming back
Every morning before the sun comes up
She'd write him an oaf from her book of love
She leaves a Dear John on his John Deere
Saying my heart's aching, my body's craving
More of your loving, don't keep me waiting
There's more for you dear, I'm contemplating
Will she have John yet, Dear John
Life on farm's hard work every day
It'll wear you down and throw you rage
But Becky keeps them young at heart
Marymond and Johnny when they're apart
For the rooster crawls and the sun comes up
Becky writes him a note from her book of love
She leaves a Dear John on his John Deere
Saying my heart's aching, my body's craving
More of your loving, don't keep me waiting
There's more for you dear, I'm contemplating
Will she have John yet, Dear John
Well, she had Johnny at Dear John
She leaves a note from her book of love, Miss John Dee, her dear John
