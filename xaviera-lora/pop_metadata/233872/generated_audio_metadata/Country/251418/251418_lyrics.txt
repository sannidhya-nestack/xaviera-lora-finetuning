I'm not at my best this evening, I feel a little low
I hear your voice and it picks me right up, always does you know
I've been here for two days running, I never liked this town
It's musty, cloudy and most unpleasant
I'm trying not to be down, down
Waiting, waiting to come on home child
Waiting, waiting again
Waiting, waiting to come on home child
In Arkansas rain
I hang around this old motel room
You hear the dealers outside
Swappin' stories and vials of death
For that ultimate ride
I got the call to pack my things and
Wait'til they're out of sight
This place ain't safe and we're leavin' now
On to Baton Rouge tonight
We're waitin' waitin' to come on home child
Waitin' waitin' again
We're waitin' waitin' to come on home child
In the Arkansas rain
I'm not at my best this evening, I feel a little low
I hear your voice and it picks me right up, always does, you know
I'm waiting, waiting to come on home, child, waiting, waiting again
We're waiting, waiting to come on home child
In the Arkansas rain
Do you never wait again?
Do you never wait again?
Do you never wait again?
You never wait again
If in the Arkansas rain
