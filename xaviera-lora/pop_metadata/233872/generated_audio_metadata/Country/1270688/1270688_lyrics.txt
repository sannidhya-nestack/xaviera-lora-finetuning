I woke up with the sunrise, hope was in my veins
Had a vision of tomorrow in a world without chains
But the winds of change came blowing and they left me here alone
With a heart full of questions and a mind like a rolling stone
Tell me where do you go when the stars don't align
What's the next step when you're lost in the night
When the plans that you had are torn apart at the seams
What do you do when your dream is shattered
Do you pick up the pieces try to start anew
Or do you sit in the silence and just feel the blues
Is there strength in the breaking or a lesson to find?
What do you do when your dream is shattered?
I built castles in the air
With foundations in the sand
Thought I'd reach for the heavens
With just a spark in my hand
But the ground gave way beneath me
And I'm falling through the cracks
With a sky full of echoes
And a future that's turned black
Tell me where do you turn when the light fades away
What's the path to the dawn when you're lost in the grey
When the hopes that you harbor are crumbling to dust
What do you do when your dream is shattered
Do you pick up the pieces and try to start anew
Or do you sit in the silence and just feel the bloom
Is there strength in the breaking or a lesson to find?
What do you do when your dream is shattered?
Do you pick up your pieces, try to start anew?
Or do you sit in the silence and just feel the blue?
Is there strength in the breaking or a lesson to find?
What do you do when your dream is shattered?
Maybe the heart learns to heal in the silence of night
Maybe the stars come to guide you with their distant light
When the dreams that you chase fade into the past
There's a new kind of freedom in letting go at last
So you pick up the pieces and you learn how to mend
Find a new kind of courage and let your heart extend
There's a strength in the breaking, a new hope to find
When your dream is shattered, you'll leave it behind
Tell me what do you do when your dream is shattered?
You rise from the ashes and you live for what matters
With the pieces in your hands, we'll rebuild what you can
And find a new dream in the shape of who you am
