You don't have to tell me you love me but I wish you would
You don't have to buy expensive things for me
You don't have to go shopping with me or watch chick flicks with me
You don't have to spend all your free time with me
Because I love you unconditionally
Well, I don't ask you to do anything for me
But I won't let you walk all over me
And even though I love you unconditionally
I still wanna be loved just for me
You don't have to call me but I wish you would
You don't have to make excuses for where you've been
You don't have to put up with my moods
Tell me I'm looking good
You don't always have to agree with me
Because I love you unconditionally
I'm gonna be here for you, not because I'm desperate
I'm gonna be here for you, not because i think you're hot
I'm gonna be here for you, not because, I want something but because
I love you unconditionally
Well I don't ask you to do anything for me
But I won't let you walk all over me
And even though I love you unconditionally
I still wanna be loved just for me
I want someone who gets me and wants to be with me
I want someone who cares about me
I want someone to be my best friend
To love me to the end
Not because I love them but because
They love me unconditionally
I want someone who listens to me and talks to me
I want someone to go dancing with me
I want someone to think of me first
Be there through the worst
Not because I'm there for them but because they love me unconditionally
Well I don't ask you to do anything for me
But I won't let you walk all over me
And even though I love you unconditionally
I still wanna be loved just for me
I wanna be loved, loved unconditionally
The way I love you unconditionally
And I do love you unconditionally
