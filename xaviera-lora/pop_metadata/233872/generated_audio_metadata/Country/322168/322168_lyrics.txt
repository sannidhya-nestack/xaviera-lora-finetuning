Ooh, ooh
He looked upon her as his princess of the mountains
She saw in him the very reason for her day
They grew up in a place that people didn't come often where the
Winters were hard and the sun shines every May
It was an August day when he first came upon her
Bright as a flower beneath the summer sky
He found some words he could have sworn he didn't have enough
And right there was the moment and the moment did fly
The path to her house would grow wider and well traveled
No mountain weather could keep him from her door
Sweet lips smiled upon him coming up the walkway
He knew in a moment no man could ask for more
The sun was shining when he reached into his pocket
For what little bit of gold his money could buy
He found the words that he'd been practicing for hours
He looked upon her, she began to cry
He said, "Rochelle, lady of the mountain
I've got a little something for your hand"
I'm a simple fellow, you get what you see
I can build you a house if you make it home for me
She said, promise me that we'll always work together
That you'll make a little room for the baby
He turned to her and said, I promise you these things are wet
And here's a little gold for the lady
Well the days turned into years and a little girl's smile turned to tears
Inside the hospital every face was long
Everything changed just like that
Mommy won't be coming back
She fought a good fight now we must be strong
That Christmas daddy placed an angel on the tree
She looked just like the lady of the mountains tenderly
Standing guard over every wish, every magic moment
Her daughter took her from the tree at the set
Hi, Mama, Lady of the Mountains
Each night I'm gonna hold you in my hands
Daddy does his best here, I'm doing great at school
And I love my room, and I'm following the rules
I miss you, Mama
I'll talk to you often, I will always be your baby
I've wrapped you warm in tinsel
That I got from the tree and he says
Here's a little gold for the lady
Now shortly after college daddy came down from the mountain
A long city drive, father of the bride
Along the way stopped and prayed and speaking softly by her grave
I said today's the big day, I need you by my side
If you don't mind I've got this ring of gold I gave you
So many years ago still shines like new
You'd be so proud of the miracle we made
Twenty-five years ago she looks just like you
He said, Rochelle, lady of the mountain
I need a little something from your hand
Well, I'm still a simple fellow, you get what you see
I built you a house and you made a life for me
Just like I promised, we're still in this together, honey
Wait'til you see your baby
He walked her down the aisle and gave her away that day
He said, "Here's a little gold for the lady"
Here's a little gold
Mm-hmm, here's a little gold
