I miss you now, on the road tonight
The only thing I want is just to hold you tight
I thought I could fill our lives up
With my greatest hopes and dreams
But it's empty here (empty here)
And the loneliness just screams
It all comes down to love
And for me (and for me)
Your love means everything
It all comes down to love
'Cause I finally see
You are all I need
It all comes down to love
To have and hold
Through good and bad
Those words give me strength
Remind me of what I have
Out here in this big old world
What I've been searching for
Was always waiting there
Behind that front porch door
It all comes down to love
And for me
Your love means everything
It all comes down to love
Cause I finally see
You are all I need
It all comes down to love
This job's been what I've lived for
In a world that steals our soul
Everything is nothing until we really know
It all comes down to love
And for me
Your love means everything
It all comes down to love
I finally see
You are all I need
It all comes down to love
It all comes down to
