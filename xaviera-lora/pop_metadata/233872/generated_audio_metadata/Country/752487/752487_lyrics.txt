I've got a question, are you the answer?
Or just another romancer?
Are you real or fake?
A sweet deal or just a mistake?
Am I making a fuss over someone I can't trust?
Are you one more excuse to lose myself in the blues?
I need to know where I stand before I fall
If I play this hand are you gonna call?
If you want a stone take it down the hall
Let me know where I stand before I fall
I've been let down before
So before I open that door
Am I being naive
If I say I'd like to believe
That you might be the one
And this may be leading to love
Do you feel in your soul
I'm your one to have and hold
I need to know where I stand before I fall
If I play this hand are you gonna call?
If you wanna stall take it down the hall
Let me know where I stand before I fall
Too many times I've been burned
Once I've reached the point of no return
Say what you mean, mean what you say
I won't have it any other way
Need to know where I stand before I fall
If I play this hand are you gonna call
If you wanna stall take it down the hall
Let me know where I stand
Let me know where I stand
Let me know where I stand before I fall
And before I fall
