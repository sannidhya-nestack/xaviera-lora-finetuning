Couple sitting at the table in the kitchen
A brand new bride and groom
Writing out thanks for the wedding gifts
Two days back from the honeymoon
When they run across a photo album
The note says from mom and dad
The kids hear something that you're gonna need
For the times that you face ahead
Here's a brand new album
For a brand new life
You fill it up with pictures of the moments in your life
You see a thing that you'll remember that we et too easily
But a picture's worth a thousand words and a million memories
And I was sitting together at the table
A few years down the road
Putting in pictures of the kids
Wondering where the time has gone
Between first steps, first birthdays
And first dates to a dance
Or saving memories of things that just don't get a second chance
Another picture in the album
Another moment in life
Another precious memory tucked away and safe inside
You see, you think that we'll remember
But we et too easily
But a picture's worth a thousand words and a million memories
each picture brings a memory
And each memory brings one more
So by the last paints there's no doubt of just what you were living for
Now she's sitting alone at the table
Her husband's gone a few years back
In her hand she holds the album
The pictures faded old and cracked
As the pages turn her memories burn
With that old familiar flame
And through the album she can hear his voice
Feel his touch again
Looking back through the album
Remembering her life
The pictures help to keep her, keep her memories alive
See, you think we'll remember, but we et too easily
But a picture's worth a thousand words and a million memories
Yeah, a picture's worth a thousand words and a million memories
