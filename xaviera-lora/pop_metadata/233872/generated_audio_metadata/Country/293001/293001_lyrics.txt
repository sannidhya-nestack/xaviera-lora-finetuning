We belong to each other for life
I don't need more than you by my side
Finally you're here with me as my bride
Even though so much has changed until now
Thankfully we became stronger somehow
Can't you see the best part of me came alive
Have I told you enough how much you mean to me?
No regrets looking back how we thought it would be
And I'm lucky enough to have all I need now that you're mine
We belong to each other for life
I don't need more than you by my side
Finally, you're here with me as my bride
We belong
