You say that we're through
And I know I'm to blame
I've been a fool and now I'm losing you
And I'm left here feeling ashamed
I know I was wrong
And I brought those tears to your eyes
I'm faced with the truth
You found someone new
Now it's my turn to cry
Oh, I was the one who took your love for granted
Everybody could see it but me
I've got no excuses, I was selfish, demanding
Now I know it won't matter
But honey, I'm so sorry
It's too late this time
How could I have been so blind
Your tears are now gone
So am I and from now on
It's my turn to cry
You only ask for the best of my love and you
You gave me yours, this I know
I'll never be sure what I was thinking of
When I drove you away, I lost part of my soul
Oh, I was so wrong
When I brought those tears to your eyes
I'm faced with the truth
You found somebody new
Now it's my turn to cry
I'm faced with the truth
You found somebody new
Now it's my turn to cry
