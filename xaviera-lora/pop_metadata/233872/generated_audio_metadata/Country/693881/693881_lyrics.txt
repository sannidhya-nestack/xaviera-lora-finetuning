She cruising down the road doing 90 mile an hour
She hasn't got the time or urge to stop and smell the flowers
Up and down the highway you can hear that engine race
The cops can't even catch her so they can't make a case
The whine from the engine it'll bring you to your knees
Ain't no doubt about it
Baby likes G's
She powering through the turn while she's stepping on the gas
That Jag is moving too slow, pulling out to fast
The tack is passing 4 gram, moving up to 5
She says she really digs us, says what makes her feel alive
She going through the gears just as easy as you please
Ain't no doubt about it
Baby likes cheese
Pistons pumping, lifters jumping, loving how it feels
Downshifting to third, putting pressure on the wheels
Holley double, double pumping, jimmy through the hood
Traction bars, spinning tires, man it's running good
Greetings on the CD player, turn it up to ten
She doesn't need a rear view mirror, don't care where she's been
Pedal to the floor is the only way she knows
And what's under the hood is something she'll never disclose
She's cruisin' down the road, flyin' faster than the breeze
Ain't no doubt about it, baby likes G's
Uh oh, here she comes again
Look out!
