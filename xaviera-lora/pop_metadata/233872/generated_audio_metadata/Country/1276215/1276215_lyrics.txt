I can see it in your eyes
You think you're gonna save me
It's so crystal clear
You can't understand why
I'm being so lazy
you don't see all of the damage that I've got
And I know you think I'm being stubborn but I'm not
I swear that I'm not
So save your words and all your good intentions
Haven't you heard that girls like me don't go to heaven
And hope's a curse and I'm so tired of pretending we both know
That girls like me don't go to heaven
You can talk until those cows come home
But you ain't gonna fix me
I've struggled and fought, carried this cross all alone
With nobody to help me
And when I grew so weak that I could barely move
You stood there telling me just be strong
Love you too if only you knew
So save your words and all your misconceptions
Haven't you heard that girls like me don't go to heaven
And hope's a curse and I'm so tired of pretending we both know
That girls like me don't go to heaven, do we though?
Don't go to heaven, do we though?
Don't go to heaven, do we though?
Don't go to heaven, we don't go to heaven
So save your words'cause you've already said them
The truth it hurts
But girls like me don't go to heaven
And hope's a curse and I'm so tired of pretending
And girls like me don't go to heaven
So save your words and all your misconceptions
I know you heard
That girls like me don't go to heaven
And hopes are cursed and I'm so tired of pretending
When we both know
That girls like me don't go to heaven
I can see it in your eyes
You think you're gonna save me
