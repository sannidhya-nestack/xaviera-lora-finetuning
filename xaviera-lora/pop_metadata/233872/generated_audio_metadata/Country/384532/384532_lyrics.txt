Now it's time to turn out the light
Close your sleepy eyes
Good night, fall asleep
Now it's time to say goodnight
And sing soft lullabies
Goodnight forest
Goodnight sleep time
Wake up bright in the morning
Good night, sleep tight
You know everything is alright
Every day must come to an end
The moon and stars must rise
Good night, forest
Tomorrow we'll have lots of fun
Beneath the sunny skies
Goodnight forest
Goodnight sleep tight
Wake up bright in the morning
You know everything is alright
You know everything is alright
