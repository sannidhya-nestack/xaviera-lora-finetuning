I saw you walking down the street
Imagine my surprise when you stopped to meet
That red headed girl at the corner store
And when you put your arms around her I knew the score
Hey, that's my kiss, the one I miss
The one you've been saving for me
And hey, I want it back, you can't do that
It's not the way it should be
It's true I don't own you but I can tell you this
You can't give it to her'cause that's my kiss
Yeah, that's my kiss
Was I naive or was I blind
Was I fantasizing in my mind
I thought your love was mine alone
I didn't realize it was just on loan
Hey, that's my kiss, the one I miss
The one you've been saving for me
And hey, I want it back, but I can't do that
It's not the way it should be
It's true I don't own you
But I can tell you this
You can't give it to her
that's my kiss
That's my kiss
And I want it
Hey, that's my kiss, the one I miss
The one you've been saving for me
And hey, I want it back, you can't do that
It's not the way it should be
It's true I don't own you
But I can tell you this
You can't give it to her'cause that's my kiss
You can't give it to her'cause that my kiss
Oh, that's my kiss (hey, that's my kiss)
Oh, baby, that's my kiss (hey, that's my kiss)
Oh, that's my kiss (hey, that' my kiss)
