Well, I've loved and lost so many times
Gave up long ago
And teed up and played my hand
Called early and hit the road
But girl, I know we're two of a kind
So now I'm gonna raise my bet
We'd make an awesome pair of hearts
And you're the best hand I'll get
That's why I'm all in on you
I'm all in on you
I had to lose to win this game
But now I know what's true, oh yeah
I'm all in on you, oh oh
Well I've made too many sucker bets
Flush with the straight I was holding
Soon enough that flop would come
Then it'd be me who was folding
But now my luck is turning round
And I'm gambling that you're the one
I like the odds on this here deal
We're gonna make a long long run
I'm all in on you
I'm all in on you
Loving's not my strong suit
And now I know that's true, oh yeah
I'm all in on you, oh
Gonna build us a full house on that river
Buy you diamonds and spades
Lovin' every night on the Mississippi Queen
I'm your Jack of all trades
And this Joker has got it made
When you know you've got a sure thing there
You can really risk it all
I don't need to count no cards or get mathematical
So now I'm betting to hold on firm
I know I'm gonna win
We're gonna have a jackpot life
And I can't wait to begin
That's why I'm all in
I'm all in on you
There ain't no limit on my love
And now I know it's true, oh yeah
I'm all in on you, oh
I'm all in on you, oh
