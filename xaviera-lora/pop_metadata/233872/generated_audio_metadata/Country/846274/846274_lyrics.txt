Before I learned to walk, I crawled on my knees
Looking up, I saw a world just beyond my reach
I cried in desperation'til I finally figured out
If I stood on my own, nothing could keep me down
I climbed that mountain
Just to see what was on the other side (on the other side)
I thank God (thank God) for mountains
Without them I'd have never touched the sky
By the time I turned eighteen I was going on forty-two
With nothing left worth doing and nothing left to prove
Then life set in not so fast boy and gave me a wake up call
I found myself surrounded by a jagged granite wall
I climbed that mountain
Just to see what was on the other side (on the other side)
But thank God (thank God for mountains)
Without them I'd have never learned to glide
There's always something to get over
Some things you just can't walk around
The choice was mine to make
Go back the way I came
Or keep moving
Never looking down
So I climbed that mountain
Just to see what was on the other side
Thank God for mountains
Without them I'd have never touched the sky
I climbed that mountain
Just to see what was on the other side
I thank God for mountains
Without them I'd have never learned to fly
