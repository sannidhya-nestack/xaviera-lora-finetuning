Every time we touch I feel a spark
And moves right through my body
Straight into my heart
Tonight the sky is filled with stars
But I don't have a wish
They all came true
The first time that we kissed
Loving you
The way I do
I'd give you the moon if I knew how
And I am sure
No one before
Would love you more than I do now
And two forever runs out of time
I would spend my life
Loving you
With every breath I take, I breathe you in
And hold you deep inside me, you hold me again
There's nothing left to dream about, you're everything I need
And in your arms the world's within my reach
Loving you the way I do
I give you the money, power and new health
And I am sure no one before
Could love you more than I do now
And if a river runs out of time
I will spend my life loving you
And two forever runs out of time
I will spend my life loving you, yeah
