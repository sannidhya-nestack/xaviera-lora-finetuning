Girl, I wish I was loving you tonight
Instead of lying here in bed all by myself
No, it don't feel right
I can't believe you're hookin' up with some other guy
When I think of him holding your hand
I feel like I wanna die, I wanna die, I wanna die
every time I pass our favorite coffee shop
And when I'm doing reps in our favorite gym
I think of you with him, with him, yes him
And every time I hear your favorite song on Spotify
I wanna cry, I wanna cry'cause I have never needed anybody
Not like I am needing you right now
So baby tell me oh oh oh
What am I gonna do oh yeah
What am I gonna do oh
Without you
Without you
What am I gonna do?
Right now I'm praying for a miracle
That you will come back to me
Baby say you will, oh say you will
I'll be here waiting when he tells you goodbye
And baby as long as I live and breathe
I'll find a way to make you mine
Make you mine, mine, mine
every time I pass my favorite coffee shop
And when I'm doing reps in our favorite gym
I think of you with him, with him, yes him
And every time I hear your favorite song on Spotify
I wanna cry, I wanna cry'cause I have never needed anybody
Not like I am needing you right now
So baby tell me, oh, oh, oh
What am I gonna do, oh, yeah
What am I gonna do, oh, oh
Without you
Without you, oh
What am I gonna do? (Hey)
Every time I pass my favorite coffee shop
And when I'm doing reps in our favorite gym
I think of you as him, with him, yes him
And every time I hear your favorite song on Spotify
I wanna cry, I wanna cry'cause I am never needing anybody
Not like I am needing you right now
So baby tell me oh oh oh
What am I gonna do, oh yeah
What am I gonna do, yeah
Without you, hey
Without you, oh yeah
Baby without you
In love my girl I wanna do
