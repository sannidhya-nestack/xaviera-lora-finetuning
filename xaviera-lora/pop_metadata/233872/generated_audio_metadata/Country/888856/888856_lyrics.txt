Cactus Jack lives way out in the desert in a little shack by himself
White beard to his waist, tan face like leather and a sidewinder skin for a belt
His sacred to life is a low carb tonic that he brews in a homemade still
He rides his mule into town, joins a party crowd at the tumbleweed bar and grill
He dances with young señoritas to all the hottest brews
They step back, amazed by Jack
As he shows off all his moves
Singing cactus juice, cactus juice
I squeeze it myself, it's like a fountain of youth
Cactus juice, cactus juice
When I'm feeling uptight and I need to get down and lose
I pour a tall cool glass of cactus juice
Bartender says Jack, we could make a fortune if we bottled up this stuff
Jack laughs, got my shack and my prickly little orchard
For this old man that's enough, I'm a simple man
I don't need much son, money means nothing to me
But I'm no saint and I dang sure ain't gonna give away my recipe
The thirsty señoritas
Beg Jack won't you give us a taste
He smacks his lips, blows him a kiss and says
I ain't got none to waste
Cactus juice, cactus juice
I squeeze it myself, it's like a fountain of youth
Cactus juice, cactus juice
When I'm feeling uptight and I need to get down and loose
I pour a tall cool glass of cactus juice
Cactus juice, cactus juice
I squeeze it myself, it's like a fountain of youth
Cactus juice, cactus juice
When I'm feeling uptight and I need to get down and loose
I pour a tall cool glass of cactus juice
Mix in a pinch of sand and two drops of morning dew
And pour a tall cool glass of cactus juice
