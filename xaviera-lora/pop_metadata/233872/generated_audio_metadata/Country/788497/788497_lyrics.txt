If you're looking for someone to make
Your old broken heart as good as new
You can find me easy, it's a piece of cake
I'm in the yellow pages under blue
I'm in the yellow pages under blue
Yeah, you can call me anytime you want
But hurry'cause I'm overdue
You don't need an operator to look me up
I'm in the yellow pages under blue
If I have a chance at a tender romance
I'll roll that pair of dice
I'm not a gambler but I'll take my chance
If I have a chance at paradise
But don't bother calling if you're not sincere
Keep yourself on faithless avenue
I've already got a heartache, that's why I'm here
In the yellow pages under blue
I'm in the yellow pages under blue
Yeah, I'm in the yellow pages under blue
I'm getting tired of playing hard to get
I'd rather play hard to et
I need someone who has gentle eyes
And I've heard it pays to advertise
So if you think you're what I'm looking for
Let's set up a rendezvous
Let your fingers do the walking right to my door
I'm in the yellow pages under blue
I'm in the yellow pages
Baby I ain't contagious
I'm in the yellow pages under blue
I'm in the yellow pages under blue
