Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There's a full moon in the southern sky tonight
But all I can see are these tears in my eyes
I keep your picture in my shirt pocket
Hold it close to my heart
Every time I think about it
Full moon, empty heart
All alone in the dark
Baby I'm here and you're not
Full moon, empty heart
We used to slow dance by the light of the stars
They sparkled like fireflies in an old mason jar
Now all I can do is make one more wish
Hide deep inside my soul every time I feel like this
Full moon, empty heart
In the dark, baby, I'm here
And you're not, full moon, empty heart
When I look to the heavens
For an answer to my prayers
I fall to my knees and say to myself
Someday I'll turn around and you'll be standing there
Full moon, empty heart
All alone in the dark
Baby I'm here and you're not
Full moon, empty heart
Full moon, empty heart
There's a full moon in the southern sky tonight
