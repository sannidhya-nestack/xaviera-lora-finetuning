Baby why'd you kiss me
Hell no I don't want them to see
Girl you know you caught my bluff
And now you got me all messed up
I wasn't looking for commitment
No not until our lips touched lips
You know it's something in your eyes girl
Leaving me breathless with a smile now
Crazy how it started with one kiss
This one, this one will last
A hundred years ain't nothing if you had it all the same
Your love keeps me in check because I love you just the same
I need you, baby yeah I need you
Come on mama you know I need you
Yeah babe you know I need you
I remember that day
Azteca church and all the earthquakes
Grand fair fest and pub crawls
The first time we hurt she stole my heart (she stole my heart)
Crazy how it started with one kiss
This one, this one will last
A hundred years ain't nothing if you had it all the same
Your love keeps me in check because I love you just the same
I need you (baby I need you)
Baby yeah I need you (oh you know that I need you)
Come on mama you know I need you (come on)
Yeah baby you know I need you (I need you, I need you yeah)
A hundred years ain't nothing when you at it all the same
Your love keeps me in check because I love you just the same
I love it when you kiss me and you turn to walk away
I can't keep my eyes off you girl you drive me so insane
A hundred years ain't nothing when you at it all the same
You know you have my heart forever keep mine just the same
A hundred years ain't nothing when you at it all the same
You have my heart forever I hope you keep mine the same
Cause I need you (yeah yeah yeah)
Baby, yeah, I need you (don't you know that I need you)
Come on, mama, you know I need you (don't you know that I need you)
Yeah, babe, you know I need you (don't you ever need you, yeah)
Come on, girl, now I need you (oh, baby, baby, I need you, yes, oh)
