When I was six, I rode my bike to smack into a tree
I banged up my left elbow, skinned up my right knee
I ran home to mama, tears streaming down my face
She held me tight and just like that
The hurt all went away
Faster than a tear drops
Love can make the pain stop
Quicker than a heart breaks
Love can stop a heartache
It's the best medicine
No matter what shape you're in
Love can make the pain stop
Faster than a tear drops
When I turned sixteen I turned with girls and fell for Bonnie Lou
She liked Bobby Thompson and it tore my heart in two
Then I met Lorien and she said she liked me
She held my hand and just like that
Bonnie Lou was history
Faster than a tear drops
Love can make the pain stop
Quicker than a heart breaks
Love can stop a heartache
It's the best medicine
No matter what shape you're in
Love can make the pain stop
Faster than a tear drops
It's stronger than the healing hands of time
A little tender love and care
And what's wrong disappears
Faster than a tear drops
Love can make the pain stop
Quicker than a heart breaks
Love can stop a heartache
It's the best medicine
No matter what shape you're in
Love can make the pain stop
Faster than a teardrop
Love can make the pain stop
Faster than a teardrop
