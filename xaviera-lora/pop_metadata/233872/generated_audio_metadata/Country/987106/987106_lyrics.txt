The sun is shining
Rivers taking me for a ride
I don't know where I'm going
All I know is I'm feeling alright
What can I say it's a beautiful day
Just to sail through life
Yeah I'm just floating
Going through the motions
Yeah I've been told not to fight it when the currents pulling strong
So I'm just floating
Ignoring commotion
Yeah I'm going with the flow and I got it pulling me along
The tide's going out
But my ship's coming in
Sometimes the waves come crashing
I feel like a drowning man
But not today
World is turning my way
Feeling high and dry
Yeah I'm just floating
Going through the motions
Yeah, I've been told not to fight it
When the current's pulling strong
So I'm just floating
Ignoring commotion
Yeah, I'm going with the flow
And I got it pulling me along
Some people sink, mm-hmm
And some people swim
Oh, but not me
Yeah, I'm just floating
Going through the motions
Yeah, I've been told not to fight it when the current's pulling strong
So I'm just floating, ignoring commotion
Yeah I'm going with the flow and I got it pulling me along
I'm just floating
Going through the motions
Yeah, I've been told not to fight it
When the current's pulling strong
So I'm just floating
Ignoring commotion
Yeah I'm going with the flow and I got it pulling me along
Yeah I'm going with the flow and I got it pulling me along
Yeah I'm going with the flow and I got pulling me along
