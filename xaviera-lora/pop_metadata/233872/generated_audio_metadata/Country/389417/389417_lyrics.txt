It's really such a pity, I don't want you anymore
I never thought that it would end this way
You just weren't listening, all the times I slammed the door
Just closed your eyes and drank the pain away
You're the kind of guy who tried to run and hide
Somewhere deep inside, somehow you lost your pride
And even an honest man turns liar
When the bottle leaves you high upon the wire
When the bottle leaves you dangling, dangling over fire
I was always looking up to you
I thought you were a king
It's taken me so long to realize
Your golden crown was nothing but a painted piece of tin
You're not the man you once were in my eyes
You're the kind of guy who tried to run and hide
But somewhere deep inside, somehow you lost your pride
even an honest man turns liar
When the bottle leads you high up on the wire
When the bottle leaves you dangling
Dangling over fire
I just always wanted something you could never give
You'd tease me with the touch I took the base
And like some damned old fisherman, you trapped me in your net
And now for me, iving is too late
Yeah, you're the kind of guy who tried to run and hide
And somewhere deep inside, somehow you lost your pride
And even an honest man turns liar
When the bottle leads you high upon the wire
When the bottle leaves you dangling
Leaves you dangling over fire
Dangling over fire
