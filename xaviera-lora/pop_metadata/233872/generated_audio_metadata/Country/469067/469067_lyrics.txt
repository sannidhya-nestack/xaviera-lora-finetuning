One night on a greyhound bus
Love caught the two of us
Sun was sinking low
When Cupid shot his arrow
Changed her plans for going west
I got a cling to my chest
Under satin sheets
I could feel her heartbeat
I was scared for the bus
Rather take the train
I was easy to fool, so easy to fool
et about us, get lost in the rain
I was easy to fool, she got the pleasure, I got the pain
One day she left behind a note
My heart jumped up into my throat
Sun was shining bright
On those tears I tried to hide
To get her back will save my soul
Put my heart back in its hole
Life is so unkind
Can't get her off my mind
I will skip the bus
Or rather take the train
I was easy to fool, so easy to fool
et about us, get lost in the rain
It's hot under the west coast sun
But cold up here in Maine
I will skip the bus, rather take the train
I was easy to fool, so easy to fool
et about us, get lost in the rain
It's hot under the west coast sun
But cold here in May
But cold here in May
