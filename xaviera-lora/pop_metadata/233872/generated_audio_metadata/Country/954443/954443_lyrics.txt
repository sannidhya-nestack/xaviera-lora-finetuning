And me
Love you
Your shouting loud inspires me
Wanna feel all your majesty
Let me
Love you
Just give me a chance to show what I mean
Can you tell me why I can't fly away with you
Forever
Someday you will find
I am high above the sky
Aurora in my sight
Flying ever high
And reaching a brilliant light
Soaring right through the stars
Someday you'll find me
High above
Aurora, can you feel me drawing near
Reaching out for your love
Aurora, the star, my lover
Your world's near
Like we need each other
Let me love you
Together we can shine a light
We're giving love a chance to fight
Let me love you
Just give me a chance to show what I mean
Baby can you tell me why
I can't fly away with you forever
Forever, forever, forever
Someday you will find
I am high above the sky
Aurora by my side
Flying ever high
Together we'll light up the sky
Shining down on the world
Someday you'll find us
High above high
We'll join together now as one, Aurora and I
I gotta find you, I gotta find you, oh
I wanna reach you now
I gotta find a way to follow you
You ain't gonna find you
For you're loving, I'm falling
Aurora, you're shining on
I wanna reach you now
Get to you somehow and follow you
(Where do I gotta find you)
For your loving and falling (I wanna reach you)
Aurora, yeah you're shining oh
