Last night it was hard to fall asleep
Thought swimming round my head shallow and deep
What am I missing was everything fine
A bolt of blue lightning flashed through my mind
That's when it hit me all day
I didn't think about you
That's when it hit me
Not a thought, not a thought about you
That drift I was howlin' at the moon
And my dog said to me, "I really dig that tune"
We danced'round the fire, beat the drum
What a strange dream I had thinkin' in the morning sun
That's when it hit me, all night
I did a dream about you
That's when it hit me, not a dream, not a dream about you
Hey, oh yeah, all night
No more crying, no more tears
All the unknowns that I don't fear
A bolt of blue lightning flashed through the sky
A bolt of blue lightning held me right between the eyes
That's when it hit me
All night I didn't dream about you
That's when it hit me
Not a dream, not a dream about you
It took time, yeah time to free my mind
It took time, time, time, yeah, to free my mind
