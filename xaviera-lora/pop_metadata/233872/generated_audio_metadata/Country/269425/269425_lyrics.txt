She didn't have a plan
When she left him back in Cheyenne
For all he put her through
She might miss him in a year or two
Stop, caution, go
She's standing in the Memphis rain
Watching the traffic flow
She's just waiting for the light
Waiting for the light to change
When love went bad to worse
She had a talk with the universe
And then she took the leap
That brought her to this corner on Beale Street
Green, yellow, red
She's smiling in the Memphis rain
Follow her heart instead
She's just waiting for the light
Waiting for the light to change
She's declared her independence
The girl who's gonna seize the day
Gonna lose her blues in Memphis
And the only sign she will love her
Is walk, run, fly
She's dancing in the Memphis rain
Soon she'll reach for the sky
For now she's waiting for the light
Trying to find the light
Waiting for the light to change
