Where the beer's always cold and the music's always high
Where work and make make it to the top
From the highest mountains to the lowest plains
From the fields of hay to the San Francisco bay
Where the rubber meets the road and a nail meets a hammer
Where the sound of traffic spreads far and wide
The bricks we laid in the USA
The bricks we laid in the USA
The brakes were late in the USA
It took a whole lot of sweat and a whole lot of pain
Where there's a place to escape they call Neverland
Where a man can speak his mind so others understand
A cave can dive a rocket splashed into space
From coast to coast a place we all embrace
Where a man with a loaf can find a helping hand
When it comes to war we make a stand
The bricks were laid in the USA
The bricks were laid in the USA
The bricks were laid in the USA
It took a whole lot of sweat and a whole lot of pain
Where the trains never stop they run night and day
If those who faith are free to pray
From a super kitchen many a man is ate
From a platform you can run as a candidate
Where a man with the talent is allowed to create
Where we all sit and cheer waiting at home plate
The bricks we laid in the USA
Bricks we laid in the USA
Breaks were laid in the USA
It took a whole lot of sweat and a whole lot of pain
Breaks were laid in the USA
Breaks were laid in the USA
It took a whole lot of sweat and a whole lot of pain
