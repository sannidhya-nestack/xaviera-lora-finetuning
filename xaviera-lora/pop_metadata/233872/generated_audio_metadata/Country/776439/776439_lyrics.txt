Well, I guess the first time was back in first grade
I tried to kiss a boy and he laughed in my face
And I cried the whole ride home
Well, a few years later now I learned a few things
So many lessons of the heart
But it still stings when it gets wrong
But you make me et all of the times I cried
Lying awake at night
You make me et when you look in my eyes with calm
You make me et all I learned from getting hurt
Well they say what don't kill you only makes you strong
Then I must have the strength of a hundred running longhorns
But I'm by myself
All this experience under my belt I learned
To never fall or crawl or feel so small
I swore never again
But you make me et all of the times I cried
Lying awake at night
You make me et when you look in my eyes with comfort
You make me et all I learned from getting hurt
I've tried so hard baby to protect my heart
Just make me a promise
I won't regret this from the start
Well if good things come to the ones who wait
Could you finally be the one I'm waiting for?
I can't take much more
But you make me et all of the times I cried
Lying awake at night
You make me et when you look in my eyes with comfort
You make me et when you hold me in your arms
It never felt so right
You make me et the wall I built around my heart
You make me et all I learned from getting hurt
You make me et all I learned from getting hurt
