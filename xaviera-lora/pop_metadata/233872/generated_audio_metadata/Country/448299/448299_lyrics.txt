There's a roadside tavern by the Whitehead Bridge
Old Milwaukee in an upright fridge
And the fried catfish is heaven on a paper plate
A corner jukebox on a pinewood floor
A Marita Brett sign on the front screen door
Crickets and worms in a bait box just outside
There's a bald eagle watchin' from a cypress tree
Spanish boss hangin' like a canopy
But the young boy's sittin' on a bank with an old cane pole
Raccoon washes off a fresh-caught brim
In the cool water where the manatees swim
That old gray heron is hopin' just to steal a meal
Well, I was breezed on the St. John's River
A part of my hard soul that'll never die
The roots of my family tree run deep
Strong as steady as a cypress tree and that's why
It'll always be old man river and me
Yeah, the moon hangs in the midnight sky
Down on the water near the county line
The shadows dance on the ground'neath the shady oak trees
And the bullfrog cries in the heat of night
Lookin' for a lover but stayin' out of sight
old man gators bound to come around later on
In the corner of the bar a young boy sings
A guitar strum and black diamond strings
Playing for the folks who have come from far and wide
Now who would have known that boy was me
Midsummer 1973
Now thirty years later I'm here and I'm proud to say
Well I was raised on St. John's River
A part of my heart and soul that'll never die
The roots of my family tree run deep
Strong and steady as a cypress knee
And that's why it'll always be
Old Man River and me
Old Man River and me
Old Man River and me
