It was just a schoolhouse cabin circa 1849
And it weren't much to look at as it was weathered by time
A hand-heeled loss cut from oak trees by strong courageous men
But abandoned by the school board when the new schoolhouse went in
Love built that cabin and it was standing there still
And love held it together that old cabin on the hill
A man bought that cabin and as he took it down
He numbered all the pieces and he hauled it into town
There was no celebration
No laughter nor tears
As he sold it to a preacher
Who was getting up in years
Now Brother John had a dream
As the logs were hauled away
That he and Sister Mary would live in it someday
He reassembled that old cabin
Though he was never once alone
For his sons, friends, and neighbors
Helped him build their cabin home
Love built that cabin
And it's standing there still
And love holds it together
That old cabin on the hill
Now some folks say that there's a mansion
And it has so many rooms
And we go there when they lay our bodies down into the tombs
Well, I've nothing against that mansion
But how I'd miss those whipperwills
So Lord just give me a little cabin
Like that old cabin on the hill
Love built that cabin and it's standing there still
And love holds it together, that old cabin on the hill
Love built that cabin and it's standing there still
Holds it together, that old cabin on the hill
