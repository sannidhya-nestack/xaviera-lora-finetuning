I always hold a winning hand at poker
If I bet on a pony's eye I never lose a dime
In a game of chance
They're sure to draw my number
But along comes a cute little flirty girl
With a wiggle and a walk and a toss of a curl
I'm a loser every time
Because I'm wrong, wrong, oh so wrong
Comes to women I'm always wrong
Life don't change before too long
Something's really gonna break my heart
I met a girl and I called her sweet Melinda
Her kiss was sweeter than a honeysuckle vine
I gave my heart and a diamond for her finger
But then on the morning of my wedding day
She and my buddy they ran away
I'm a loser every time
Because I'm wrong, wrong, oh so wrong
Comes to women, I'm always wrong
Luck don't change before too long
Some filly gonna break my heart
