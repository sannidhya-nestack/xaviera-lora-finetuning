I fell off the wagon again
I thought booze was my only friend
I fell off the wagon again
My wife she had to go away
She couldn't stay another day
I don't know what I'm gonna do
I'll probably just drink another brew
My wife, she'd come home and I'd be drunk
I'd been drinking all day long
No matter how much she might try
She just had to say goodbye
Now I fell off the wagon again
I thought booze was my only friend
I fell off the wagon again
I fell off the wagon again
I thought Booze was my only friend
I fell off the wagon again
And now I'm out and on my own
But I don't want to be alone
Booze has never been my friend
It brought our love to an end
I fell off the wagon again
I thought booze was my only friend
I fell off the wagon again
I fell off the wagon again
