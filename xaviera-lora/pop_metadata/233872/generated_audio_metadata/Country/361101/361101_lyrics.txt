One of the first songs I ever heard was "I'll Be There"
And I wanted to sing "A, B, C, 1, 2, 3"
Maybe I was just a little bit off the wall
But this man in the mirror
Said I just got to be there, gotta be there
My cowboy hat's off to you
Even though I'm country
in music we're all family
You helped me learn to grow
Just watching you put on a show
My cowboy hat's off to you
Country is my roots but I still like to rock with you
That moonwalk sure was something
I still put on thriller and bailed out just beat
Can't stop till I get enough
You were definitely bad, really bad
My cowboy hats off to you
Even though I'm country
in music we're all family
You helped me learn to grow
Just watching you put on a show
My cowboy hats off to you
You helped heal the world through song
Didn't matter whether black or white
You made it a better place
You added color to my life
My cowboy hats off to you
Even though I'm country
in music we're all family
You helped me learn to grow
Just watching you put on a show
My cowboy hats off to you
Whoa, my cowboy hats off to you
You helped me learn to grow
Just watching you put on a show
My cowboy hats off to you
