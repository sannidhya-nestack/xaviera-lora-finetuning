When I think of him in them baggy pants
It just makes me smile
Love to dance with danger hand in hand
He could chase away the blues
Keep a cowboy safe and sound
God must have sent a second son that was a rodeo clown
Watched him move inside the ring, a common commodore
Met a bull they called Hellfire eye to eye
Just when you thought he'd lose the game, but steal the devil's crown
God must have sent a second son that was a rodeo clown
A wild, brave, crazy rodeo clown
All the trouble in the world could turn it upside down
God must have had a second son that was a rodeo clown
When that bull began to spin my tail get on her chin
From heat come running in
You gotta love that rodeo clown
A painted face with eyes so bright just like a reckless child
Dodging horns of lightning side to side
He could make the angels laugh
Make old Satan frown
God must have sent a second son
That was a rodeo clown
Was a wild brave crazy rodeo clown
All the trouble in the world could turn it upside down
God must have had a second son that was a rodeo clown
When that bull began to spin, I'd take it on the chin
But he'd come running in
You gotta love that rodeo clown
You gotta love that rodeo clown
