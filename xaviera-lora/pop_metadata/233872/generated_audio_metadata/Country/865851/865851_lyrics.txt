I must admit it caught me by surprise
To see you dancing round with butterflies
A couple years hanging out with friends just having fun
Then tonight you tell me you think you've found the one
You could've heard her heart break right about now
Trying to live my life by the golden rule
Think about others before you think about you
So if somebody else can bring you happiness
Girl I should just wish you only the best
But I feel myself stop breathing
Right about now, it's all about love
It's all about you and it's all about us
I've gotta find a way to make it clear somehow
Exactly how I feel, right about now
Hope it's not too late to make you understand
That none of this was ever part of my plan
But I've gotta say it in case you feel it too
It ain't no one I want to like, I'm wanting you
Finally it hit me
Right about now
It's all about love
It's all about guilt
And it's all about us
I've gotta find a way
To make it clear somehow
Exactly how I feel
Right about now
If I can't find a way to make it clear somehow
I ain't ever gonna feel right about now
What if I'm right about now?
