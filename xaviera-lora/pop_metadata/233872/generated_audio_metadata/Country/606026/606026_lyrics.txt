Me and Sue used to fool around in the woods behind her house
And we would run just as fast as we could and tumble to the ground
The first time I felt her lips gently kiss my mouth
I knew this must be the heaven
She was talking about
Kiss me like this, love me like that
The innocent years fly by so fast
You gotta latch on to love and make it last
And kiss me like this, kiss me like this
When you kiss me like this I can't resist
So kiss me like this
In the high school parking lot we'd hide inside my best friend's car
And sit and talk in the back seat outside it was raining hard
She drew a heart on a steamy window and wrote my name with her fingertip
She pulled me close and whispered
Baby, this is it
Kiss me like this, love me like that
The innocent years fly by so fast
You gotta latch on to love and make it last
And kiss me like this, kiss me like this
When you kiss me like this, I can't resist
So kiss me like this
A boy became a man
Today she squeezed my hand
And then her lips touched mine
Time after time
Kiss me like this, love me like that
The innocent years fly by so fast
You gotta latch on to love and make it last
And kiss me like this, kiss me like this
When you kiss me like this I can't resist
When you kiss me like this I can't resist
When you kiss me like this I can't resist
Oh, kiss me like this
