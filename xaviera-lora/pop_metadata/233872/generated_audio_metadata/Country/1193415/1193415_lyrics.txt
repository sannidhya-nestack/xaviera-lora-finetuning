Prayers were mine were answered when you came my way
A miracle day and now I
Just wanna take this one Saturday to celebrate
Do you know how much I love you
Wanna make sweet love now to you all day long
All I want is to make you happy
Lay here and want you so badly all day long
Wanna give you the kind of love that you've never known
Nothing could delight me more than turning you on all day long
The skin, your skin on mine keeps me so mesmerized
Your surrendering eyes
And I love to feel us sew into one another
Best friends and lovers, baby
Do you know how much I love you?
Wanna make sweet love now to you all day long
All I want is to make you happy
Lay here and want you so badly all day long
I wanna give you the kind of love that you've never known
Nothing could delight me more than turning you on all day long
Our best days are still, still to come
This one for sure
Is a priceless one
Do you know how much I love you
Wanna make sweet love now to you
All day long yeah
All I want is to make you happy
Lay here and want you so badly
All day long
I wanna give you the kind of love that you've never known
Nothing could delight me more than turning you on all day long
Nothing could turn me on more than turning you on all day long
All day long
All day long
