You would always sing that song for me
Shout it out and I'd do the harmony we'd make
Talking in the breeze, walking in the leaves so free
The whole sweet world was mine
We lost all track of time forever late
We missed a lot of parties then
We'd try to make it but be late again
And we would sing
Walking in the rain
Down that misty lane
So free
The whole sweet world was mine
We lost all track of time
Forever late
We couldn't say goodnight
In each other's sight
Everything else good way
Forever lay with me
You would always sing that song for me
Shout it out and I'd do the harmony we'd play
Talking in the breeze, walking in the leaves so free
The whole sweet world was mine
We lost all track of time forever late
The whole sweet world was mine
We lost all track of time forever late
