It's Friday night, I got nothing to do
Ain't got no money, feeling kinda blue
Well, we cleaned the house, washed the car
Took a little time, didn't get as far
Now less don't argue, now less don't tussle
Get out of the yard and do the chicken coop shuffle
Well, scoot your feet and flap your wings
Let Rhode Island Red do his own thing
Well, it ain't the twist, no, it ain't the hustle
Get out on the floor and do the chicken coop shuffle
Now when you're out dancing, you better be aware
They'll be doing the shuffle, scratching everywhere
It's cute little ditty, so easy to do
You'll be doing the shuffle'fore the night is through
So put on your jeans, you don't need a bustle
Get out on the floor and do the chicken coop shuffle
Well, scoot your feet and flap your wings
Let Rhode Island Red do his own thing
Well, it ain't the twist, no, it ain't the hustle
Get out on the floor and do the chicken coop shuffle
It ain't the two step, it ain't the hustle
Get out on the floor and do the chicken coop shuffle
