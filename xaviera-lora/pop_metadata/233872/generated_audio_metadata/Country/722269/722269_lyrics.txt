It took me forever to get used to holding you
And babe I thought I'd never believe you loved me too
I've never been so lucky had to let it all soak through
Now you're telling me it's over and I just got used to you
How do I begin again
With no one there to see me through
Don't know what I can say
To make you change your mind and stay
But I'll be missing you
It was hard to imagine what you could see in me
But you said I was exactly the way your girl should be
Just when I start believing everything you said was true
You go and say it's over and I just got used to you
How do I begin again
With no one there to see me through
Don't know what I can say
To make you change your mind and stay
But I'll be missing you
Just when I start believing everything you said was true
You go and say it's over and I just got used to you
You go and say it's over and I just got used to you
