Working in the factory you make lots of friends
This is the story about one of them
He walked right beside me he never missed a date
He was always so happy jolly and free
He had a permanent smile never said a word
It was like he had a secret hidden somewhere on earth
He had a permanent smile
He had a permanent smile
He never had a day without a permanent, a permanent smile
Then one day the door flew open wide
There stood Brandy, his permanent smile
Later in private all my friends agreed
A woman like Brandy could put a smile on me
He had a permanent smile, never said a word
It was like he had a secret hidden somewhere on earth
He had a permanent smile, he had a permanent smile
He never had a day without a permanent, a permanent smile
He never had a day without a permanent, a permanent smile
No, he never had a day without a permanent, a permanent smile
