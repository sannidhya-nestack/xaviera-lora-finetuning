Well a fool and his honey soon parted
And I found that out the hard way last night
My honey left me broken hearted
When she up and told this fool goodbye
My honey was the root of all evil
My friend said, "Boy, don't listen to her lies"
But she broke my heart into a thousand pieces
Even though I've heard it said a million times, oh
That a fool and his honey are soon parted
And I found that out the hard way last night
My honey left me broken hearted
When she up and told this fool goodbye
Oh and if honey changes everything like some folks say it do
Then why am I stuck here loving someone never once been true?
Come on, play it loose Floyd
Oh yeah, that's what I'm talking about
Come on, well they say that honey talks and they ain't lying
she talked up every pretty boy in town
I wouldn't hurt this bed if I was dying
Instead I'm crying like some sad and foolish clown
they fool and his honey are soon parted
And I found that out the hard way last night, yes I did
Well my honey left me broken hearted
When she up and told this fool goodbye
Yeah she up and told this fool goodbye
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's true, honey don't buy happiness
I can state that unequivably, unequivably, for certain
You know what I'm talking about, come on
Unequiv -man I know it for sure
