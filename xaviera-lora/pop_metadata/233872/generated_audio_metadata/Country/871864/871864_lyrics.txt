This craft will bear our weight
And we won't crash into the sea
To be otten in the waves
Our destiny is held together in this wind
And we may as well be ghosts
Behind an empty space
It's been tough, there is no drug that's strong enough
To make me feel or lift me up
The way you do with just a smile
I have been blind, I've been a fool
Well, I've been so reckless and so cruel
It's all that I can do to stay afloat
Evangeline, all the things we've seen
I won't waste your time
Evangeline, all the things we've seen
I won't waste your time
Your heart's an open book
That you share with just a look
And give me comfort when I'm down
I watch the night with ships that sail across the sky
They call my name and I reply
Well is there anybody out there?
And it spins up there is no mountain high enough
To lift me up and let me fly the way you do when we're alone
And as we both spin out of sight around this world in a satellite
Is all that I can do to stay afloat, Evangeline
Old things we've seen, now I won't waste your time
Of Angeline
All the things we've seen
I won't waste your time
Evangeline, all the things we've seen
I won't waste your time
Evangeline, all the things we've seen
I won't waste your time, Evangeline
All the things we've seen
I won't waste your time, Evangeline
All the things we've seen
I won't waste your time, Evangeline
All the things we've seen, I'm all with you
