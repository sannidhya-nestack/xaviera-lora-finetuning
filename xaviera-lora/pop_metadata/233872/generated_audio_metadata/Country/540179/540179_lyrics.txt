Just another night, up until sunrise
Look at the clock, it's a quarter to five
Yeah, but door slam, sorry once again
You don't even see where you've been last night
All this hurt I feel inside
Melt away each time I look into your eyes
Drag me down, break the rules
But I'm still here like a crazy fool
I still keep loving you
No matter what you do
Still keep loving you
I still can't et when we first met
Swear that you were heaven sent
Now these days you act a little strange
I wish we could start over again
No matter what you put me through
'Cause no one else could ever take the place of you
You drag me down, break the rules
I'm still here like a crazy fool (and you)
Still keep loving you, no matter what you do
I try, you chase me up inside
I can't deny
Loving you is hard sometimes
Drag me down, you break the rules
And I'm still here like a crazy fool
Still keep loving you, no matter what you do
Drag me down, you break the rules
And I'm still here like a crazy fool
Still keep loving you
Still keep loving you
Still keep loving you
No matter what you do
Still keep loving you
Loving you
Still keep loving you
Loving you
Loving you
Still keep loving you
No matter what I do
