Surprise me with your two dogs named Sam and Ray
I had you figured for having cats
Watched you out on horseback riding on Saturday
Thought you'd be out shopping or something like that
But I tell ya, I kinda like it
Learning little things about you I never knew
I never knew the warmth of your beautiful smile
Would melt my heart, make my life worthwhile
I never knew you'd be my dream come true
I'm in love with you
Like I never knew
Blown away when you pulled up in that truck named Hot Pursuit
I thought for sure you'd be in a car
And you had me do a double take at those designer boots
When you took the dance floor at that country bar
But I tell ya, I kinda like it
Learning little things about you I never knew
I never knew the warmth of your beautiful smile
Would melt my heart, make my life worthwhile
I never knew you'd be my dream come true
I'm in love with you
Like I never knew
Yeah, I never knew the warmth of your beautiful smile
Would melt my heart and make my life worthwhile
I never knew you'd be my dream come true
I'm in love with you
Like I never knew
Oh yeah
Like I never knew
Yeah, I never knew you
