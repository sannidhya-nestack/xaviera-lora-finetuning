She was raised on country music and rock'n' roll
Hank Williams, G e Jones, Leonard Skinner and R .E .O.
And she loved to sing along with every song she knows
While decked out in her cowgirl hat
Black leather jacket with tattoos that say "Born to Rock"
And I love Johnny Cash
She's rock'n' roll with boos right down to her roots
She cranks Bon Jovi nice and loud and hangs out with the country crowd
A rebel through and through
A city girl with a country attitude
She's rockin' roll with boots
Yeah, rockin' roll with boots
And she sings karaoke at the local bar
Singin' "I love rock'n' roll" in Kenny Chesney's Big Star
And she knows all the words to every song by heart
Decked out in a cowgirl hat, black T-shirt, hot leather pants
She's Tanya Tucker lookin' like Joan Jett
Rock'n' roll with boots right down to her boobs
She turns kid rock up nice and loud and parties with the country crowd
A rebel through and through
A city girl with a country attitude
Rock and roll with blue
She loved to sing along with the songs she grew up on
A city girl with a country attitude
Rock and roll with boots, yeah
Right down to her roots
She cranks AC /DC nice and loud
And hangs out with the country crowd
She's a city girl with a country attitude
She loves rock and roll and country too
She's rock and roll with boom
She loves to sing with the song she grew up on
She loves to sing with the song she grew up on
She's rockin' roll boots
