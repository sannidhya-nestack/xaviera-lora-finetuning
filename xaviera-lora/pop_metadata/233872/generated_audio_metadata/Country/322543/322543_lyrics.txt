Summer skies, fireflies, this is how we prioritize
It's all about balance, life is good so far
You and me happily, raising up this family
One disaster at a time, everything will work out fine
Nothing's turned out like I pictured it (We need it baby)
So many ups and downs
But overall it's a perfect fit
This is as good as it gets today
Baby that's okay
Long as I'm with you
All my dreams come true
Lots of pool, lots of breeze
Little swim is all we need
Before we wake up (wake up)
And do it all over again
Mrs. Johnson next door
Says the kids just wrecked your Ford
But that's okay (I know, I know)
Nobody's bleeding, right?
Here we go, get the checkbook (again)
Let's have a little look (okay)
Car's alright I guess
I don't know about that bike
How's your week been going so far? Sorry honey
What the heck? Write the check
Hey it's only money
This is as good as it gets today
Baby that's okay
Long as I'm with you
All my dreams come true
Life's a pool of the breeze
Little swim is all we need
Before we wake up and do it all over again
Nothing else matters (nothing at all)
Unless it's you and me
One love, just right, little house and a family, yeah
This is as good as it gets today
Baby that's okay
Long as I'm with you
All my dreams come true
Lots of pool, lots of breeze
Little swim is all we need
For we wake up and do it all over again
I'll wake up with you anytime
Do it all over again
Because life's a pool (life's a pool) jump right in
It's about you and me baby
