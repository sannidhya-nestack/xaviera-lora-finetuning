(coughing)
(yawn)
In the black churning backwaters where the bayou twists and turns
Swamp vines hang from cypress trees no memories return
To the Chautauqua and the Creole legends still abound
With tales of black water voodoo ghostly whispers through the town
You hear the hounds cry in the distance and your pulse begins to race
There's a quiet, eerie stillness settles round the place
Cold sweat beats down the back of your neck and a terror grips your heart
There's a world of fear, you best stay clear of the bayou after dark
It's a fright
To spend the night
In the back of the bayou
(In the back of the bayou)
It's enough
To break a strong man
Into his teeth
Well I guess you've got some time to kill
Just as well you might not last the night
In the back of the bayou
I can hear them calling still
If the snakes don't get you
The gators will at night
In the back of the bayou
There's menace in the moonlight, a mist falls like a veil
You better keep a close eye for fear you'll lose the trail
The shadows start creeping, it's better you not be around
The swamp fever's gonna catch ya when the sun comes crawling down
The dead of night
You can die in fright, in the back of a Bayou
Well it's enough, oh to bring a strong man, to his knees
Please, please, please, I guess you've got some time to kill
It's just as well you might not last the night
In the back of the Pio
I can hear'em callin' still
The snakes don't get you, the gators will ignite
In the back of the Pio (In the back of the Pio)
In the back of the Pio
Oh, I guess you've got some time to kill
Just as well, you might not last the night (Oh, in the back of the fire)
I can't hear'em coming still (Oh, stay stuck as you're the fool, the demons will) (Oh, in the back of the fire) (In the back of the fire)
And they never found a trace, no they never found a trace
They never found a trace, no they never found a trace
They never found a trace, never found a trace
