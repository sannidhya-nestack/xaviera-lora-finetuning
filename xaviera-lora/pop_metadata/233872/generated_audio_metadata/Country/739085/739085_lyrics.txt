I woke up this morning to a brand new day
And your memory didn't haunt me in the same old way
I feel more like the girl I used to know
I'm letting go
The sky's a little bluer than it used to be
And the sun's a little warmer shining down on me
All the signs are starting to show
I'm finally letting go
I've held on to the bitter past so long
It became a part of me
Till I saw it in a different light (a different light)
I couldn't set it free
Now I close my eyes and I don't see your face
Tears that fell like rain are gone without a trace
Something new is starting to grow
I'm letting go
I've held on to the bitter past so long
It became a part of me
I saw it in a different light (a different light)
I couldn't set it free
I'm not sayin' I'll never think of you
But I'll smile just a little every time that I do
It's only fair that you should know
I'm letting go
It sure feels good to know I'm letting go
