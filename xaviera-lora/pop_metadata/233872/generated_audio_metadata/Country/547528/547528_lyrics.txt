Hello, I'm pleased to meet you
My name's conductor Jack
I'll need to take your tickets as you ride on down the track
The engineer is stoking coal, the engine spouting steam
The fireman waves the lantern as he hears the whistle scream
Rolling past the houses and farms and fields of hay
My family's at the last stop, I'll meet them there today
I rode the train to Texas on the number nine
Then back to California to see those kids of mine
Five hundred miles I'll travel on the eastbound track
We turned around the other way, five hundred miles back
Five hundred miles I'm traveling to where I want to be
Home to see my children and hold them close to me
Climb aboard kids, ride that train
I cannot deny it, I am a railroad man
Like those who came before me, travelin' this great land
There's Railroad Bill the Ramblin' Man, his memory goes way back
And Casey Jones the Engineer, John Henry built the tracks
There have been many railroads across the USA
The Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe
You can ride the Midnight Special on the Penn State Railroad line
But my heart's in California with those great kids of mine
Five hundred miles I'll travel on the eastbound track
We turn around the other way, five hundred miles back
Five hundred miles I'm traveling to where I want to be
A home to see my children and hold them close to me
Let's see those tickets
Next stop California
The curves and hills and valleys are beautiful to me
The sky so blue, the pasture green, the horses running free
The stainless steel engine is like a work of art
But truthfully, my children are closest to my heart
I've punched a thousand tickets, I've yelled my all aboards
I've seen all of the stations, this five hundred mile tour
The rhythm of the engine
Is rocking me to sleep
When morning comes I'll be back home
My children close to me
Five hundred miles I'll travel on the eastbound track
We turn around the other way five hundred miles back
Five hundred miles I'm traveling to where I want to be
Home to see my children and hold them close to me
Home to see my children and hold them close to me
