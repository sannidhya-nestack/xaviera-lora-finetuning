I slip on my straw hat and dance down the road
I'm going to visit a friend
But I'm not a dancer, so I have been told
But I'm happy to be who I am
And I pick on a guitar, though I pick kinda slow
I pick it whenever I can
But I'm not a picker, so I have been told
But I'm happy to be who I am
I'm happy to be who I am
I'm happy to be who I am
Well, I may look different and you may not understand
But I'm happy to be who I am
I like to plant green beans and watch'em all grow
While I'm eating my blackberry jam
But I'm not a farmer, so I have been told
But I'm happy to be who I am
And I sing in the shower when I'm out of control
I sing every place that I can
But I'm not a singer as you all now know
But I'm happy to be who I am
I'm happy to be who I am
I'm happy to be who I am
Well, I may look different and you may not understand
But I'm happy to be who I am
I walk in the mountains when the wind blows so cold
I carry hard cornbread and Spam
Maybe I am simple like I have been told
But I'm happy to be who I am
I'm happy to be who I am
I'm happy to be who I am
Well, I may look different and you may not understand
But I'm happy to be who I am
I'm happy to be who I am
I'm happy to be who I am
Well I may look different and you may not understand
But I'm happy to be who I am
