Came home last night, found the furniture gone
Bank book's missing and the checkbook's overdrawn
All she left me was the scent of her perfume
It led me to the note attached to my subpoena
I must have done her dirty
My baby's taking me to the cleaners
Was it the time I passed out on the lawn
I woke right up when the sprinkler went on
I knew it wasn't our love in bloom
Her hand was on the faucet, man you should have seen her
I must have done her dirty, my baby's taking me to the cleaner
I've been sanitized, martinized, hung out on the line to dry
Depressed, starts to stretch, all washed up in her eyes
Bleached, dyed, shrunk, dried, wrung out, strung out, steamed alive
She's tearing me apart at the seams
I thought I called the sweetest angel on earth
I tried to give her everything she deserved
She traded in her halo for a broom
And now she's got a meaner demeanor
I must have done her dirty
My baby's taking me to the cleaner
I've been sanitized, martinized, hung out on the line to dry
Depressed, starched and stretched, all washed up in her eyes
Bleached, dyed, shrunk, dried, wrung out, strung out, steamed alive
She's tearing me apart at the seams
I must have done her dirty
My baby's taking me to the cleaners
Oh I must have done her dirty
My baby's taking me to the cleaners
