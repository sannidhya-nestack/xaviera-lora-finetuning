Grills are smoking, bean bags are tossing
Major media's reporting, banners are flying
Fans are yelling, cheerleaders are jumping
Blimp is hovering
This place is rocking
Cause it's almost time
For the big game, sell out crowd
Everybody getting loud
The big game, feeling proud
Tonight we're taking home the crown
We know why we came
It's running through our veins
The crowd is waving
Feet are stomping
Hands are clapping
Home team is winning
Cause it's now our time
Oh, the big game, sell out crowd, everybody gettin' loud
The big game, feelin' proud, tonight we're takin' home the crown
We know why we came, it's runnin' through our veins
The big game, a timeout on the field
The tension begins to build
The big game, sell out crowd, everybody gettin' loud
The big game, feelin' proud, tonight we're takin' home the crown
We know why we came, it's runnin' through our veins
The big game
The big game
The big game still out crowd everybody getting loud
Oh the big game
