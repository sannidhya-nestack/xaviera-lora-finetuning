Here I am stuck in traffic again
AC's broken it's a hundred and ten
Tried to call in but my cell phone's dead
Been better off staying home in bed
Crazy old boss won't leave me alone
Elvis toupee dollar store cut alone
The Xerox machine ate my report
Lost a promotion to a skirt that's too short
If I can make it to tomorrow
That's one last day to go
It'll bring me that much closer
To having you to hold
What keeps me going
Is the thought of seeing you again
You make everything alright
Like I make it to the weekend
Uh huh
Friday evening I'll be in your arms
Sleeping Saturday with no alarms
Spend the day doing what we want to do
Coffee Sunday morning as the sun shines through
If I can make it to tomorrow
That's one less day to go
It'll bring me that much closer
To having you to hold
What keeps me going
I thought of seeing you again
You make everything alright
If I can make it to the weekend
Some days it feels like I don't have a prayer
At least it's Wednesday, I'm halfway there, yeah
If I can make it'til tomorrow
That's one less day to go
It'll bring me that much closer
To having you to hold
What keeps me going
Is the thought of seeing you again
You make everything alright
If I can make it to the weekend
Oh, it keeps me going
I thought of seeing you again
You make everything alright
I can make it to the weekend
