Love is a two way street
You can take it or give it
It happens in a heartbeat
It takes a lifetime to live it
It'll take you on a ride like a roller coaster rolling
It has it's ups and downs
But it's the best thing going
It's the one thing in the world that'll set you free
L-O-V-E
It's like nothing on earth you've ever seen or heard
I'm talking'bout love, that lovely four letter word
Love is a melody, you can sing it or listen
When you fall in love with me, you're gonna find out what you're missing
I'll take you on a trip to the center of my heart
Right then you'll know for sure
What I've known right from the start
It's the one thing in the world that'll set you free
L-O-V-E
It's like nothing on earth you've ever seen or heard
I'm talking'bout love, that lovely four letter word
Love that's stronger than a sweet summer kiss
Or a dream coming true on the very first wish
L
O-V-E
It's like nothing on earth you've ever seen or heard
Talkin'bout love, that lovely four letter word
I'm talkin'bout love, that lovely four letter word
