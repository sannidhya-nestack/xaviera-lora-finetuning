He's a redneck tech-spur, he lives electronically
His time's now measured in bytes, and he spins it wirelessly
His radio comes by satellite, his doc's on WebMD
And when it comes to that old corn toss
He's got the high score on the Wii
He watches NASCAR on his phone, there's an app for that
When he's feeling all alone, there's a chat for that
Got an e-date for the fair, there was a match for that
He's completely crossed over, and he'll never revert
He's a redneck techspert
Blackberry hooked to his overalls
Bluetooth in his ear
He sends an IM to the bartender
When he needs a round of beers
He texts, he tweets
He's networked on 3G
He's linked and he's connected internationally
He says, "Stop by MySpace, have a look and see"
At the fish I mounted on my wall in Facebook Me, yeah
Talladega weekend without talking
To a soulful music on my MP3
He's a redneck techsper
There's an app for that
There's a chat for that
He watches NASCAR on his phone, there's an app for that
When he's feeling all alone, there's a chat for that
Got an e-date for the fair, there was a match for that
He's completely crossed over
And he'll never revert
He's a redneck techspert
He's a rednecked expert
He's a rednecked expert
