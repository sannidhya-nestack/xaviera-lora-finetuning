Everywhere I go
It's the same old story
First you love me
Oh then you say you're sorry
You're with another man
Interesting way to find
With a second time lover
You really don't miss my mind
I won't be your second time lover
Can't do like the others
No matter how hard I try
To take me you make, baby you lose me
Love like mine is hard to find
It just can't be this way
I hope you're nobody's fool
And don't you feel ashamed
You know that you can't do
All this fooling around
Is gonna waste my time
Well second time lover you don't have to make up your mind
I won't be your second time lover
Can't do like the other
No matter how hard I try
Don't teach me, use me, baby, use me
Love like mine is hard to find
Well, second time lover
Can't do like the other
And I'm tired of being pushed all around
Well, I've got a good reason for changing the season
I'll try to keep my feet on the ground
I better not catch you messing around with another man
Huh, cause you know you had it coming to ya
Don't you waste my time
We're second time lovers, you're gonna have to make up your mind
I won't be your second time lover, damn too like the other, no matter how hard I try
Can't take me and you, man,'cause baby you lose me
Love like mine is hard to find, well
Sick of that lover, can't do love the other
And I'm tired of being pushed all around
Well I've got a good reason for changing the season
I'm trying to keep my feet on the ground
Well, thinking'bout another, thinking to love the other
And I'm tired of being pushed all around
Well I've got a good reason for changing the season
I'm trying to keep my feet on the ground
Well I've got a good reason'cause this love isn't pleasing
I'm trying to keep my feet on the ground
Well I've got a good reason
Something isn't even
I'm trying to keep my feet on
I'm trying to keep my feet
Well I'm gonna keep my feet on the ground
