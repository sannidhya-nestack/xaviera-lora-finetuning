I can see through your disguise
You're trying hard not to let me in
Something must have happened to you
Shaped your pain now you keep the head
It's too easy to get lost in your thoughts every day
In the bigger picture it doesn't matter
Soon enough they will fade away
It comes to nothing
It comes to nothing at all
It comes to nothing
It comes to nothing at all
Ooh, nothing at all
Oh, nothing at all, oh, oh, oh
Everyone is fighting demons
No one alive has never lost
Don't let it grow, just let it go
As though it's nothing at all
Can you imagine eternity?
Or does it blow your mind?
Oblivion is your destiny
Gotta leave this world behind
It comes to nothing
It comes to nothing at all
It comes to nothing
It comes to nothing at all
Ooh, nothing at all
Ooh, nothing at all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Nothing at all
