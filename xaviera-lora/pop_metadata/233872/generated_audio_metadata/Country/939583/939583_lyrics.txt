They say love is hard to find, I say they are wrong
I don't even need to try, with you it's natural
I'm as happy as I've ever been, it's all because of you
I know I'm the lucky one, but you say you're lucky too
And I'm like, yeah, that's right
Oh, look at us hand in hand
Oh, we fit perfectly together
It's not rocket science, there's a ton of chemistry
Oh, when it comes to you and me it's easy
When it comes to you and me it's easy
It's not complicated, it's not a mystery
It's not impossible to get, it's fragile but it's lasting
I feel it deep inside my bones, you bring it out of me
It makes me feel invincible, alive and free
Oh, just look at us hand in hand
Oh, we fit perfectly together
It's not rocket science but there's a ton of chemistry
Oh, when it comes to you and me it's easy
Oh, look at us hand in hand
We fit perfectly together
It's not rocket science
But there's a ton of chemistry
Hey, oh
When it comes to you and me it's easy
When it comes to you and me it's easy
When it comes to you and me it's easy
When it comes to you and me it's easy
They say love's hard to find, I say they're wrong
