Behind the reporter those homes were ablaze, I don't know
What's going on these days
That missing girl, she's only seventeen
There's a picture of her, the homecoming queen
I can't watch this TV another minute more
Can't hear my wife and kids pulling from the store
Gonna hug my family when they walk in the door
And when they ask what that was for
I'll say just because
How about another hug?
We heard from my brother, he's coming home today
We've been waiting, oh how we prayed
Celebration, a backyard barbecue
A cake decorated in red, white and blue
He did us proud but so relieved it's his last tour
Here comes mom and dad laying on the horn
Gonna hug my brother when he walks in the door
No one will ask what that was for
We all know it's love
How about another hug?
Gonna hold the ones I love like I'll never see them again
Gonna squeeze them like this might be the end
Gonna hug my family when they walk in the door
And when they ask what that was for
I'll say just because
How'bout another hug?
It's time for another hug
