I heard you've been looking for a shoulder to cry on
The one you relied on turned her back on you
That sure sounds familiar
I remember when you left me
I was introduced to lonely
When you found someone new
But I don't hold that against you
Even though you broke my heart
Here's what to do
When you can't sleep
And start to fall apart
Rest in pieces just like I did
On those sleepless nights alone
If you want pity don't look to me
It turned my heart cold as stone
Learn to kill time
Dryin' your eyes
Stayin' up nights
Hopin' she'll come home
Rest in pieces
Just like I did
On those sleepless nights alone
You'll talk to reflections
Staring out the window
Then cry on your pillow
Till tears spill on the floor
It's easy to imagine what's going on in your life
You're in for a long night, loneliness knocking on your door
I don't take pleasure in knowing you're forsaken
For what it's worth you'll survive
But while your heart is breaking
Rest in pieces just like I did
On those sleepless nights alone
If you want pity, don't look to me
You turned my heart cold as stone
Learned to kill time, dryin' your eyes
Stayin' up nights, hopin' to come home
Rest in pieces just like I did on those sleepless nights alone
Rest in pieces just like I did on those sleepless nights alone
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
