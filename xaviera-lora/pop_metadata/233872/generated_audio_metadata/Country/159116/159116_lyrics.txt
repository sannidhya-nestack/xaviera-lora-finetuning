I like cheese sliced thin, or cheese in a ball, or parmesan
I like it all, however it comes, don't matter to me, I'll have some
In French onion soup or grilled on bread, or cracker cheese that comes in a spread
Like Camembert or Philadelphia cream, what a friend we have in Jesus
Mozzarella, brie or blue
What a friend we have in cheeses
From fettuccine to fondue
For spokes with jack cheese I'm a fool
Pork wine tastes fine until a McToo
Delis are my favorite places to browse
It goes with everything I have found
I put it on my grape nuts when no one's around
I know that's weird but I love it so
What a friend we have in Jesus
Mozzarella, brie or blue
What a friend we have in Jesus
From fettuccine to fondue
What a friend we have in Jesus
Mozzarella, briole, or blue
What a friend we have in Jesus
From fettuccine to fondue
