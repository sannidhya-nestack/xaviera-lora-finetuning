Joe was heading for disaster back in 1993
He was looking for a fight but there was no one there to see
He held up his hands and he gave himself a shot
It felt so damn good that the hole marked the spot
Face down in the gutters where he'll be in the end
The road he walks down he'll crawl down again
And everything he is he owes to heroin
And then came Julia with an open mind and heart
Wasn't looking for a monkey or a habit to start
She said I'll do anything, anything for you Joe
So she buckled up her seatbelt and jumped into the hole
The fish down in the gutters where she'll be in the end
The road she walks down she'll crawl down again
And everything she is she owes to heroin
They were locked up together with the life they chose to lead
Started stealing for the feeling they really learned the need
They weren't blaming anyone, they knew what they'd done
It hit rock bottom and the thrill had lost its fun
Facedown in the gutters where they'll be in the end
The road they walk down they'll crawl down again
And everything they are they owe their hair away
