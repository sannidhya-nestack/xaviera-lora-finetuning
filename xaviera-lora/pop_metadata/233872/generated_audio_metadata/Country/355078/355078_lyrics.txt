It all happened with a kiss
Out of nowhere, but I'm liking this
Nothing's been the same since you kissed me
You kissed me
I don't know why this happened
What to say
I had to act and learn to put my hands
All I know is that it feels so right
I'm on air and that's a good thing
my knees won't work
And that's alright because I'm in your arms
The way this feels so right
You found a way to make the world stop
Yeah, that's what you do to me
And never mind that you're my best friend
You kissed me, you kissed me
I don't know why this happened, what to say
How to act and where to put my hands
All I know is that it feels so right
I'm on air and that's a good thing'cause my knees won't work
And that's alright because I'm in
Your arms where this feels so right
Keep'em coming, oh kiss me, kiss me
We can talk tomorrow
Maybe then you'll tell me, tell me what you were thinking
What were you thinking?
I don't know why this happened, what to say
How to act and where to put my hands
All I know is that it feels so right
I'm on air and that's a good thing'cause my knees won't work
And that's alright because I'm in your arms
And where this feels so right (feels so right)
It feels so right (It feels so right)
