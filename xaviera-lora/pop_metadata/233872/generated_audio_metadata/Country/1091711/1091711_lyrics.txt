My Aunt Genevieve loved to work in the garden
She had a way with life
So when I started to wrestle at big questions
I went to her for advice
I asked her, "Who am I?"
Why are we here? What's life all about?
She tousled my hair and said it's good that you wonder
But don't spend too much time trying to figure life out child
Just throw your head back and do a little dance
Water the flowers in the gardens you plant
Say a prayer of thanks for this glorious chance
To be part of it all
She said there's billions of feelings
And trillions of stars
In this huge old wide universe
But I wish I could
But I don't know how
To wrap all this up in words
Now on down the road
If we meet our maker
We might see the big picture
Until then I hope
You won't think yourself crazy and everyday dear child
I hope you'll remember to throw your head back and do a little dance
Water the flowers in the gardens you plant
Say a prayer of thanks for this glorious chance
To be part of it all
To be part of it all
Part of it all
Part of it all
Part of it all
Part of it all
