I'm loving you more than I can say
I'm needing you, need you more each day
I'm loving you, love you in my way tonight
I'm holding you, holding you again
I'm feeling you close against my skin
I'm holding you, hold you in my arms tonight
And when the stars come gather round
To see the way we shared that moment after sunset
I love the way it feels when I'm all wrapped up tight in you
And we're closer now than I thought we'd ever get
I'm seeing you
See through every part
I'm hearing you
You're breathing and your heart
I see just who you are tonight
