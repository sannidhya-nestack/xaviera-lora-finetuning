Gently close your eyes with my fingertips
Slowly tilt your chin and kiss you on the lips
Press you to my heart and never let you go
Whisper the words I want you to know
I loved you before you were born
Like waiting for the sunrise in the dark of the morning
I've cherished your features before they were formed
I loved you before you were born
I loved you before you were born
Like a work of art, perfect and pure
Your every move is graceful and lovely
The colour of your skin is a shade of the sunset
Your smile captures light, light from the stars
I loved you before you were born
Like waiting for the sunrise in the dark of the morning
I cherished your features before they were formed
I loved you before you were born
I loved you before you were born
Be my baby and I'll be your man
Always wear this ring I place on your hand
Here by my side this is the start
Not even death will keep us apart
Not even death will keep us apart
Gently close your eyes with my fingertips
Slowly tilt your chin and kiss you on the lips
Wrap my fingers round your tiny hand
Whisper the words, one day you'll understand
I loved you before you were born
I've prayed every night for this day to come true
I've waited a lifetime to be holding you
Now every day I thank the Lord
I loved you before you were born
