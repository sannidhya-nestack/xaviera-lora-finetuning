Four years since we've been together, oh
Seems like a day, it seems like forever
Some days are hard and some days are easy
Some days you're staying, some days you're leaving
Some days we're close and some days we're closer
Some days it's on and some days we're over
Some days we fall in love
And you can't see the best parts of me
You can see the bed and all the places in between
Darling you can feel the fire in this heartbeat
You turn me inside out'cause all that counts is underneath
And if you look underneath, underneath
Some days you look to me for love, oh
Some days my love ain't good enough
Some days you care about my feelings
Some days you break me into pieces
Some days your smile melt my heart
And some days we try to fall apart
And some days we fall in love
Darling you can see the best part for me
You can see the back and all the places in between
Darling you can feel the fire in this heartbeat
You turn me inside out cause all that counts is underneath
And if you look underneath
You'll find the best parts
The best part of me
And if you look underneath
You'll find a big heartbeat
You can see the best parts of me
You can see the band and all the places in between
Darling you can feel the fire in this heartbeat
You turn me inside out'cause all that counts is underneath
And if you look
You'll find the best parts, the best part of me
And if you look underneath, underneath
Four years since we've been together, oh
Seems like a day, seems like forever
