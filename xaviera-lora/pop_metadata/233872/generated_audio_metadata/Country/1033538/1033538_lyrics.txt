Well Johnny got his name back when he was a lad
He had a reputation but he wasn't really bad
He liked to lay down in a big green field
Where the secrets of the world might be revealed
Then one fine day that boy discovered girls
And Johnny set to hell with the secrets of the world
Greengrass Johnny found a whole new way
Greengrass Johnny to spend his day
Greengrass Johnny made all the gals sing
Greengrass Johnny was the greengrass king
Ladies lined up three city blocks when
Greengrass Johnny says it's time to rock
Well Johnny was the coolest senior at Humes High
He had the admiration of the gals and guys
when lunch time came, the biggest news
Was seeing which girl he was gonna choose
One day Johnny looked at Susie B. and said
Hey there lady, will you lay with me?
Greengrass Johnny, well he met his match
Greengrass Johnny, soon was quite a catch
Greengrass Johnny, saw him flying everywhere
Greengrass Johnny, gophers running scared
Yeah, throwing up turf like a John Deere mower
And Johnny's thinking, "Man, I thought I was a goer"
Johnny wasn't a wangel and Susie was a gas
Her and Johnny fell in love in the tall green grass, well
Now Johnny isn't playing like he used to do
Susie took his invitation like she always knew
They'd spend their days in the green grass lovin'
they had their own little turkey in the oven
That day Susie straightened out her blouse and said, "Johnny, we really need a house"
Greengrass Johnny
So they bought a hoe
Greengrass Johnny
And he'll never row
Greengrass Johnny
They got a new bed spread
Greengrass Johnny
And a greengrass bed
Now Sue's just as happy as a duck in a hat
With Greengrass Johnny and their laundromat
Greengrass Johnny
That's right, they bought a laundromat
Greengrass Johnny
Grass stains, you know?
Greengrass Johnny (he's a lot of tide)
Greengrass Johnny (but those wads get clean, capiche?)
Greengrass Johnny
Greengrass Johnny
Greengrass Johnny
Loves him some Susie B
