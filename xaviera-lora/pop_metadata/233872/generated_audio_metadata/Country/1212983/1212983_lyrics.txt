Well, I left home when I was three
I didn't get far between you and me
I had nowhere to go, nowhere to hide
But I slunk away for an hour or two
I cut my hand and lost a shoe
Then I limped back home to eat my pride
Now I don't know why I ran away
My dad was mean and to this day
I remember he prayed out loud while drinking beer
But my ma was sweet and tricked me right
And when I came home late that night
She held me tight and she began to cry
She said, "These are happy tears
These are happy tears
It's good to have you home where you belong
So don't be sad if you see me cry
It's only something in my eye
Remember these are my happy tears"
When I was ten I ran amuck, I drank some beer and stole a truck
Thought I was the toughest kid in town
And every time I went to school I'd play around and act the fool
Didn't care what they did to bring me down
But I went too far and to my shame I'd only gotten myself to blame
I was sent away to put me back to right
And I cried all day and cried all night
It gave me such an awful fright
And when I came out my ma began to cry
She said, these are happy tears
These are happy tears
It's good to have you home where you belong
So don't be sad if you see me cry
It's only something in my eye
Remember these are my happy tears
Son, these are my happy tears, alright
When I was seventeen I met a girl the sweetest in the world
I got a job and a place where we could stay
So I told my ma I was moving on and I thanked her
For all she'd done then she began to cry those happy tears
She said, "Son, I've done the best I can
I've seen you through'til you're a man
You've had some ups and downs along the way
But by the grace of God you got through
So whatever you decide to do
Take my love and take my happy tears"
These are happy tears
These are happy tears
It's good you've got a place of your own
So don't be sad if you see me cry
It's only something in my eye
Remember these are my happy tears
Son, these are my happy tears
Happy tears, happy tears, yeah
Son, these are my happy tears
