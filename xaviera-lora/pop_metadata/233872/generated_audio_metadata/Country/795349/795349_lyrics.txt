Well you kept telling me that all my running round was bunk
That it's chasing after every pretty face would leave me in a funk
I guess that you don't understand the kind of man I am
I was made for chasing women, I do it every chance I can
So I took myself another chance when I saw her standing there
She was all that heaven offers with green eyes and all burnt hair
But you just laughed and shook your head when I finally realized
You took my money, she's not heaven, she's a devil in disguise
And I hate to say you told me so, especially when it's true
But I was so darn wrong and you were right
You said you know what's best for me but I was such a fool
So I hate to say you told me so but I just might tonight
Yeah I just might
When I found myself a new girl you said she'll only break my heart
She'll set me up to knock me down and tear me all apart
You said boy just take a minute
See the forest for the trees and then you smiled
And all at once I got it
You're the girl for me
Well I hate to say you told me so but it's what I have to do
Cause I was so darn wrong and you were right
You said you know what's best for me, and honey that is true
I used to hate to say you told me so, but I will tonight, yeah tonight
I used to hate to say you told me so
But it's what I have to do
Cause I was so darn wrong
And you were right
You said you know what's best for me
And honey that is true
I used to hate to say you told me so
But I will tonight
I hate to say you told me so
But I give up the fight
