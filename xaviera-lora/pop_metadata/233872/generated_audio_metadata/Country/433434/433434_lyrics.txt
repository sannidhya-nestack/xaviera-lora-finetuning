She's like a bullet through my heart, I feel the pain
This goddamn woman's driving me insane
All you do is cuss and fight, throwing your lips and mines
Dark kingdom come, I'll grab your gun and blow you outta sight
All this pushin' and shovin'
You ain't showin' me no lovin'
Huggin' and kissin'
Come on baby, that's what I've been missin'
It's not me, honey, it's you
It ain't me, hell no!
If we stay together, we will always be the same
On gun club road
I'm feelin' so alone
On gun club road
That's'cause you're holding to the bone (woman, I'm fixing to get my shotgun, wait and see)
Oh please, you're full of hot air, don't threaten me
The two of us make no sense, one of us has got to go
I'll keep the keys to this house, what you waiting for? There's the door
All this pushin' and shovin'
You ain't showin' me no lovin', huggin' and kissin'
Come on baby, that's what I've been missin'
It's not me honey, it's you
It ain't me, hell no
If we stay together, we will always be a suck
On Glock Glock Road
On Glock Glock Road
Women, you drive me crazy, then I sleep tonight
Let me tuck you in, fluff your pillow, fill it with dynamite
Hong Kong Club Room (Girl, you make my head explode, that's this)
This is the club room (This is the club room, love of my life, you ain't seen nothing yet)
It's on tonight
