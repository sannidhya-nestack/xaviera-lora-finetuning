Where does he want to be
With somebody who's been with everybody else
I said she'd hurt you and you'd cry all the time
And I know what it's like
When they don't leave your mind
But she's not perfect
Just get that in your head
You know I'm worth it
So pick me instead
Cause I know she's beautiful
But she can't give you what I can
What I can
I won't make you cry, I'll leave you for another guy
On the side of the road thinking, "Why did you go?"
I can't believe what you've just told me
Because I honestly thought that it was me
It always ends the same, they never pick the average Jane
I'm always just a friend
There's no one to hold my hand
And I feel the same
What is so wrong about me?
It is this that I don't understand
I know I'm not flawless, like I've got freckles on my nose
But that's not what you're looking for, I suppose
Because I'm not beautiful, but you can't give you
What I can, what I can
I won't make you cry, I'll leave you for another guy
On the side of the road thinking, "Why did she go?"
I can't believe what you've just told me
Because I honestly thought that it was me
It always ends the same
Because boys like you don't like girls like me
You don't think I'm pretty
But I know I'm beautiful and I still got feelings
I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna be your leading lady
And I know she's beautiful but she can't give you what I can
What I can, I won't make you cry, I'll leave you for another day
On the side of the road thinking, why did she go?
I can't believe what you've just told me
Because I honestly thought that it was me
It always ends the same, they never picked the average Jane
