Let's go back to those falling love days
Taking our time, walking home in the rain
Dancing by the fire, outlasting the flame
Let's go back to those falling love days
Let's go back to those hot summer nights
Parked on a hill counting stars in the sky
Radio playing holding each other tight
Let's go back to those hot summer nights
Take my hand, close your eyes
We'll get away for a while
Lock the door and plug the phone
We'll pretend nobody's home
Let's go back to those fun afternoons
Sneak off together to our rendezvous
A basket, a blanket, just me and you
Let's go back to those fun afternoons
Take my hand, close your eyes
Let's get away for a while
Lock the door and plug the phone
We'll pretend nobody's home
Let's go back to those falling love days
Taking our time walking home in the rain
Dancing by the fire outlasting the flame
Let's go back to those falling love days
It's never too far, it's never too late
Let's go back to those falling love days
