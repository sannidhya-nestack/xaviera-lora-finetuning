She's a gathering storm
The making of another legend
And as the black clouds form
Oh, this storm has no kind end
She's going to blow, gone below
Just another gathering storm
Both been feeling it
Even if it's a little bit
A change in the air
A chill and a darkness
Sounds of silence lay bare
She's a gathering storm
The making of another legend
She's going to blow, gone below
Just another gathering storm
Hard when love leaves
All you do is just grieve
Just a building of anger
And that only gets bigger
Storm clouds just build in her
She's a gathering storm
The making of another legend
And as the black clouds form
Oh, the storm has no kind end
She's going to blow, gone blow
Just another gathering storm
Hard when love leaves, all you do is just grieve
Just a building of anger
And that only gets bigger
Storm clouds just building her
She's a gathering storm
The making of another legend
And as the black clouds form
Oh, this storm has no kind end
She's going to blow, gone blow
Just another gathering storm
