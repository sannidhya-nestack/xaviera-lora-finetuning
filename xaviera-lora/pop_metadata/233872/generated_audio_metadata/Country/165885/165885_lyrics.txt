Sometimes people can tell us apart
I know what you're gonna say before you start
Look in the mirror and you'll see my smile
Pick up the phone and melt away the mask
I know you'd do anything for me
Climb any mountain, cross the deep blue sea
it's only water, you know it's not thicker than blood
When I need you, you roll in like a flood
You're my sister, you're my best friend
We got love that'll never end
Pure as gold, rare as a gem
If you weren't my sister
I'd choose you for my friend
Even though you're far away we're still so close
Our bond's so deep and it's in our bones
Stronger than diamonds and solid as stone
It lives in my heart and it sings in my soul
You're my sister, you're my best friend
We got love that'll never end
We're closer now than we've ever been
If you weren't my sister
I'd choose you for my friend
Oh, my best friend (my best friend)
You know you are my best friend
