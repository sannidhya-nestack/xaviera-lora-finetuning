The seat was up when I sat down
Lord only knows why I didn't drown
Paper rolls empty surprise surprise
Just standing there grinning but you oughta hide
Don't give me that puppy dog look
Don't think you're getting off the hook
You're gonna get it good
Just like you know you should
You begged to be rescued
Good
You're gonna get it good
You stumbled in at a quarter to four
I looked at the clock when you fell on the floor
There's only so much that I can take
I'm about to snap, think I'm gonna break
I don't know what a girl's to do
Putting up with a guy like you
You're gonna get it good
Just like you know you should
You begged to be rescued
Good
You're gonna get it good
On second thought, maybe not
Making up's more fun
You're gonna get it good
Just like you know you should
You'll beg to be rescued
Good, you're gonna get it good
Just like you know you should
You'll beg to be rescued
Good, you're gonna get it good (na na na, na na na na na na)
Gonna get it good (na na na, na na na na na na)
Na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na, na na na na na
