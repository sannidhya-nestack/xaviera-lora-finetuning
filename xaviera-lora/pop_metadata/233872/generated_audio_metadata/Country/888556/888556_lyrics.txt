I pull into the driveway and my son comes running up
I barely even stop the car and he gives me a big hug
He's my little buddy, I'm his biggest pal
And every night until the sun goes down
He's my five o'clock shadow, going everywhere dad goes
Oh, he makes his dad go
How my little son shines
Always trying on dad's clothes
Always stepping on dad's toes
He's my five o'clock shadow
And the light of my life
On weekends he won't let me sleep
He wakes me up at dawn
He makes believe he's shaving too and yawns each time I yawn
A special kind of friendship
A precious kind of love
And all day long until the moon shows up
He's my five o'clock shadow
Going everywhere dad goes
Oh he makes his dad glow
How my little son shines
Always trying on Dad's clothes
Always stepping on Dad's toes
He's my five o'clock shadow
And the light of my life
He follows in my footsteps
And matches every stride
If he's not right behind me
Then he's right by my side
He's my five o'clock shadow
Going everywhere dad goes
Oh, he makes his dad glow
How my little son shines
Always trying on dad's clothes
Always stepping on dad's toes
He's my five o'clock shadow
And the light of my life
Always trying on Dad's clothes
Always stepping on Dad's toes
He's my five o'clock shadow
And the light of my life
