The rodeo will teach you how to fall
When I was thrown
The clowns taught me to crawl
Then you appeared
And I've sowed all my fears since you arrived
Suddenly I feel just alive
A golden palomino riding out in a rodeo
The headliner of the show with a mane as white as snow
A golden palomino
Silver tail dancing in the breeze
For all of the world to see
A golden palomino
I heard your voice
I had to fall for you
I had no choice
What else was I to do
Now that you're here
Let me make one thing clear
You are the sun
Thanks to your love
I have become
A golden palomino
Riding out in a rodeo
The headliner of the show
With a mane as white as snow
A golden palomino
Silver tail dancing in the breeze
For all of the world to see
A golden palomino
Our course was all I thought I'd be
Until your love made me
A golden palomino
Riding out in a rodeo
The headliner of the show
With a mane as white as snow
A golden palomino
Silver tail dancing in the breeze
For all of the world to see
A golden palomino
I pray I will always be
Your golden Palomino
