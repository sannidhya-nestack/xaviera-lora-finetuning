After the homecoming football game
We celebrated back at the gym
Girls on one side and boys on the other
Records playing, lights softly dimmed
I watched you fast dance, waited for my chance
The DJ slowed it down
You said yes and since that night we met
Our feet haven't touched the ground
We had a slow dance, romance
There in each other's arms
A slow dance, romance
In step with the beat of our hearts
When the song ended we were still holding hands
Neither one of us could let go
Of our slow dance romance
We still go to all the big games
But now we celebrate at home
Push back the couch, roll up the rug, and turn on the radio
In the soft moonlight, I'm holding you tight, some things never change
The first time we touched, we fell in love, and danced the night away
We had a slow dance, romance
There in each other's arms
A slow dance, romance
Each step with the beat of our hearts
When the song ended we were still holding hands
Neither one of us could let go
Of our slow dance
Romance
When the song ended we were still holding hands
Neither one of us could let go
Of our slow dance
Romance
Slow dance romance
Slow dance romance
