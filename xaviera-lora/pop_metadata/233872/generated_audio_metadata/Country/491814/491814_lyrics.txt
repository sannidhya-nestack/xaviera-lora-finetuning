I was born redneck and raised blue collar, she was fed with a silver spoon
She sipped champagne at five star restaurants
I drank beer at honky tonk saloons
I was a slow winding river
She was a deep blue lagoon
It was a dog gone pity how she cried in the city
Tell I, my oh my, how I
Taught her how to smile, southern style
Slow and easy like a lazy summer breeze
Their foot walkin'neath magnolia trees
Sweet tea talkin', front porch swingin'
Crickets singin' in the moonlight
Southern style
Now a fluffy cat named Princess Julie
Goes a-huntin' with my blue-tick hound
And she traded in her turbo beamer
For a ride in my pickup to my two-horse town
When she tasted the good life
They turned her whole world upside down
She said I'm deep down happy as a matter of fact
We were hot, so why not
Tied the knot, I got some fish in line
Southern style, slow and easy like a lazy summer breeze
Barefoot walkin'neath magnolia trees
Sweet tea talkin', front porch swingin', cricket singin' in the moonlight
Southern style
Yeah, she loves me like the sunflower loves the bees
Life is sweet for my honey and me
And we like it
A southern style, slow and easy
Like a lazy summer breeze
Barefoot walkin'neath magnolia trees
Sweet tea talkin' front porch swingin'
Crickets singin' in the moonlight
Mmm, southern style
Yeah, we like it southern style
