You can't think straight, I just can't wait'til the next time I see you
Can't get enough of your tender touch, though I know that it's taboo
I can't love or live without you, so what am I supposed to do?
I need you too bad for my own good
If I could leave you, you know I would
But I can't go, though I know that I should
I need you too bad for my own good
I tell myself, leave him on the shelf
I never look back again
But when I hear his siren song
I'm back where I began
I can't control the way that I feel
There's more than I can conceal
I need you to bear for my own good
If I could leave you, you know I would
But I can't go, though I know that I should
I need you too bad, my only you
Can't control the way that I feel
There's more than I can conceive
I need you too bad for my own good
If I could leave you, you know I would
But I can't go, though I know that I should
I need you too bad
For my own good
I need you to bad
For my own good
I need you to bad
I need you to bad
For my own good
