I was caught up in a daydream with you
Stuck in the moment on a Sunday afternoon
And I didn't realize I was lost inside those eyes
So blue
You don't owe me a thing
No explanations or diamond rings
you can't tell a lie
No, the truth ain't hard to find
Not when I'm lost inside those eyes so blue
Daydreaming, seeing is believing and I can see forever with you
Stuck inside a daydream, taken by the feeling that I can be together with you
Darling, won't you stay? Baby, we can dream the day away
Daydreaming with you
Lying here right next to you
A silver lining on a cloudy afternoon
And I didn't try to hide
I was lost inside those eyes
Those twenty years they passed so soon
Won't you come away with me
I'll take you to the place I wanted you to see
Baby, let me be everything you need
Won't you come dream your life away with me?
Daydreaming, seeing is believing
I can see forever with you
Stuck inside a dead dream
Taking pride in the feeling
That I can be together with you
Darling won't you stay
Baby we can dream our life away
Dead dreaming with you
Daydreaming with you, daydreaming with you, daydreaming with you
Daydreaming, daydreaming on a Sunday afternoon I was daydreaming with you
