She might call at 3am just to talk about her day
She might not call at all for a week or two
She might just show up at my door in a coat covered negligee
Yeah, never know what that crazy heart might do
Right now she's in the Smoky Mountains
Taking in majestic vistas
Southbound on that Appalachian Trail
And soon enough she'll call and say
Can you pick me up and I'm on my way
Wishing that crazy heart didn't need to run so free
And hoping that crazy heart stays crazy for me
She swears one day she'll settle down and raise a mess of kids
In Alaska, oh she loves those northern lights
Me I'm good with anywhere
Give me a cabin off the grid
As long as it's with her
Cause she's my life
Right now she's in the Smoky Mountains
Taking in majestic vistas
Southbound on that Appalachian Trail
And soon enough she'll call and say
Can you pick me up and I'm on my way
Wishing that crazy heart didn't need to run so free
And hoping that crazy heart stays crazy for me
Wishing that crazy heart didn't need to run so free
And hoping that crazy heart stays crazy for me
