I can't believe this goodbye note you left me
I better have myself a shot of whiskey
To keep my head from thinking
To keep my heart from sinking
I'm drinking alone
Says here you weren't thinking'bout forever
And last night we were lying close together
To keep my head from thinking
To keep my heart from sinking
I'm drinking alone
I'm drinking alone and feeling torn in two
Holding on to this bottle instead of holding you
Well, I'll get numb and sleep here in this chair
I can't go to bed without you there
To keep my head from sinking
To keep my heart from sinking
I'm drinking alone
Yeah, I'm drinking alone
Well, I'll get numb and sleep here in this chair
I can't go to bed without you there
To keep my head from sinking
To keep my heart from sinking
I'm drinking alone
Yeah, I'm drinking alone
