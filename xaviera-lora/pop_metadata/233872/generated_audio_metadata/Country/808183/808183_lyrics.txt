She was asking, she was asking friends
She was asking friends about me
She must be curious, she must be curious
She must be curious about me
When you told her, when you told her
When you told her about me
What did she say, what did she say
When you told her about me
I saw her, I saw her standing in the crowd
In the crowd of friends
And I knew it
I knew it then
She was someone new and different
She stood out in that crowd
And she filled me with curiosity
Curiosity
They say that she is
Curious (curious)
Serious (serious)
Mysterious
Delirious
Furious
About me
Curiosity
Curiosity is found
Found a way in
Now I have to find
Find the right way
To begin
When you find that someone
Is asking about you
What should you do
You find it
It is true
Do you know the lady
Do you know her name
I don't know the lady, I don't know her name
But I will talk to her just the same
I saw her, I saw her standing in the crowd
In the crowd of friends, and I knew it
I knew it then she was someone new and different
She stood out in that crowd and she filled me with curiosity
She filled me with curiosity
