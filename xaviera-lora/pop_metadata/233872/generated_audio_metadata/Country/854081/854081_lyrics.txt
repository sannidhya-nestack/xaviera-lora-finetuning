You're so outrageous
You always know just how to make'em blush
Your wicked smile it gives'em such a rush
You're every little school girl's secret crush
You're such a badass
You say the word and make her heart beat fast
Could it be that I have met my match?
I've never known the likes of you
Were you a straight-A student always skipping school
Shooting silver bullets through the goal and a rule
Fiercely independent since your terrible twos
I bet your mama didn't know what to do
With you, you're so outrageous
You always know just how to make'em blush
Your wicked smile, it gives'em such a rush
You're every little schoolgirl's secret crush
You're such a wild one
The kinda wild that's always so much fun
To ride with you into the setting sun
Would have to be a dream come true
You're unoriginal
By your own set of rules
One of a kind
End of the line
Definitely genuine
Cool cool cool
You're so outrageous
You always know just how to make'em blush
Your wicked smile it gives'em such a rush
I've never known the likes of you
Show'em, boy
Yeah, that's right
I don't want no Casanova, a one track mind
No fast talking playboy, I just don't have the time
To waste on a loser, want something to prove
If there's someone singing my kind of tune
It's you, you're so outrageous
Your wicked smile it gives me such a rush
Every little school girl's secret crush
You're such a badass
You say the word and make our heart beat fast
Could it be that I have met my match?
I've never known the likes of you
You're so outrageous, and just the right kind of dangerous
Your wicked smile, it gives me such a rush
You're every little schoolgirl's crush
You're such a wild one, the kind of wild that's always so much fun
To ride with you into the setting sun would have to be a dream come true
To ride with you into the setting sun
Would have to be a dream come true
