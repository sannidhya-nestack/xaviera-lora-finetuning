Just a plan of thing I guess to main
I was playing my dentist's laptop
After sitting back watching every movie made
Brought the man in black to Elvis
Had a little cheating heart
And when he played old chef I knew my choice was vain
After suffering chores and home from school
I grabbed my K-guitar and stole
And on the front porch slapping mosquitoes tried to sing
They be picking at a grinning just to me and my pa
Like Roy Buck on O'Hee Haw
And let the pine trees be our Nashville audience
And they sang timber I've fallen with my two part harmony
Send me the pillow that you dream on was in the sea
Sixteen tons and what do you get?
He was singing from the heart when he said
Hello I'm Johnny Cash
I was Luther on guitar
Now twenty some-odd years have passed but it seems like yesterday
And I was begging him to teach me wall bash, cannonball
He don't play us but he used to and that's alright
I've got these country music memories to recall
After supper and chores and home from school
I grabbed my kid guitar and stole it
On the front porch slapping mosquitoes and tried to sing
We'd be picking and a grinning just to me and my pa
Like Roy Buck on O'Hee Hall
And let the pine trees be our Nashville audience
And he sang timber I'm falling with my two part harmony
Send me the pillow that you dream on was in the sea
All sixteen tons and what do you get?
He was singing from the heart when he said
Hello I'm Johnny Cash
I was Luther on guitar
When he said
Hello I'm Johnny Cash
I was Luther on guitar
