Tell me why, why does it have to hurt, loving you
Tell me why, why does my heart break in two
In the beginning you said you were mine
Oh now another, another is crossing your mind
So tell me why, why does it have to hurt loving you?
Once you told me that I
I was your only one
And now another, another is on your lips
And baby she's on your tongue
Well I can't share and I can't wait
And I can't stand another heartbreak
So tell me why, why does it have to hurt loving you
You've had your pick of all of the women of your life
You thought you could come and go in a moment's time
Well now
The chase is over
You finally got me
But you found someone new
But tell me why
Why does it have to hurt loving you?
Well, loving you was so good and so fulfilling
You always made, you made my head spin
Baby, you kept me realin'
But I guess once, once your chase is over
Then you are through, oh so through
But tell me why, why does it have to hurt
Lovin' you
Please tell me why, why does it have to hurt, loving you
