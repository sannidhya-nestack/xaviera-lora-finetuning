People always say go out and meet somebody new
They just don't get it, I still go to bed thinking of you
Every day gets a little smoother
Just like the shots I take to pass the time
Everything comes rushing back at night
But in the morning I'll be just fine
after a while
I won't feel this pain
After a while, my heart won't scream your name
After a while, I'll move on
I am weak but getting strong
I'll find peace just knowing what went wrong
After a while
Seems like all the beautiful days are long gone
Soon I'll learn to smile again and maybe have some fun
But for now there's nothing left to say
No pretty love songs left to sing
Nothing but silence
That alone should tell you everything
after a while
I won't feel this pain
After a while
My heart won't scream your name
After a while, I'll move on
I am weak but getting strong
I'll find peace just knowing what went wrong
After a while
I'm still bleeding
But I'm still breathing
But everything's gonna be okay
Everything's gonna be okay
After a while
My heart won't scream your name
After a while, I'll move on
I am weak but getting strong
I'll find peace just knowing what went wrong
After a while
Oh after a while
People always saying go out and meet somebody new
