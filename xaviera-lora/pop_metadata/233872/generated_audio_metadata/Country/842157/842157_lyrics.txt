Who knew I'd ask you for a date?
Who knew we'd get along so great?
Who knew that we'd both feel this way?
I've got a hunch, baby, you know
Who knew I'd ever settle down?
Who knew there'd never be a doubt?
Who knew we'd need a bigger house?
I've got a hunch, baby, you know
Who's to blame for all this happiness?
Your guilty smile is telling me you're not so innocent
I'll let you in on a little secret if you want to know the truth
You're not the only one who knew
Who knew that you were such a catch
Who knew we'd make a perfect match
Who knew that you and I would last
I've got a hunch baby you know
Who's to blame for all this happiness
Your guilty smile is telling me you're not so innocent
I'll let you in on a little secret if you want to know the truth
You're not the only one who knew, no
You're not the only one who knew
Now you know, I know, you know, who knew
