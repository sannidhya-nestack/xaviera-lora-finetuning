I've known love that was hard as summer
But ended up colder than snow
I've known love that lit up the heavens
But somehow lost its glow
I've known love I thought was constant
But was restless as the wind
If you ask me how I describe right now
The love that I am in
I'd say right as rain is the way I'm feeling
Right as rain washing over me
No more pain since the day you saved me
I know this love is right as rain
I've known love that was like a twister
And it blew me right off my feet
But it seemed I always landed somewhere I never wanted to be
Then came you and it seemed like every little thing fell into place
Then came you and my spirit took off like a rocket into space
Right as rain is the way I'm feeling
Right as rain washing over me
No more pain since the day you saved me
I know this love is right as rain
Then came you just like an answer that had been there all along
You made up for every direction I had taken that was wrong
Right as rain is the way I'm feeling
Right as rain washing over me
No more pain since the day you saved me
I know this love is right as rain
Rain, rain, won't you stay? Sun can come another day (I'm feeling rain)
Rain, rain, won't you stay? Sun can come another day (I'm feeling rain)
Rain, rain, won't you stay? Sun Can come another day (I'm feeling rain)
Rain, rain, won't you stay? Sun Can come another day (I'm feeling rain)
Rain, rain, won't you stay? Sun Can come another day (I'm feeling rain)
Rain, rain, won't you stay? Sun can come another day (Rain, rain, won't you stay? Sun can come another day)
Rain, rain, won't you stay? Sun can come another day (Rain, rain, won't you stay? Sun can come another day)
