Papa, if you could see me, I ain't doing so well
I found God, he told me to go to hell
So that's where I am now, but it ain't so bad
All the drinks are cheap
You get a free monkey for your back
I'm walking with Dante
But he ain't walking with me
Just a drink in that whiskey
Dancing on the boiling seas
So I asked Virgil
What's it like to be brave
He just shrugged his shoulders
Went back to his grave
And all the love I've known
Never knew me at all
It just pleased my body
Him to build the wall
So baby if you want me
You better tell me quick
I'm a pretty good lover
But beyond that I ain't wild shit
To hell with Cerberus
Let him chase his tail
Toilets them on times
For the ones who will well
et about Beatrice
She's a lifetime away
If you listen to the wind
You can hear her sing
Gaze not at the stars
But in the eyes of men
For lonely is heaven
When you have not a friend
If I obey my heart
Will my heart be free
Papa when I'm dust
Will my dreams dream of me?
And all the love I've known never knew me at all
It just pleased my body and a member of all
So baby if you want me
You better tell me quick
I'm a pretty good lover
But beyond the high rushing
So baby if you want me
You better tell me quick
I'm a pretty good lover
But beyond that I watch it
I'm a pretty good lover
But beyond that I watch it
