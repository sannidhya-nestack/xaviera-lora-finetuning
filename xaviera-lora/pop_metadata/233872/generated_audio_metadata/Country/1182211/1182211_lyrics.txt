Walking all alone down Silverado Trail
Can I stand to live another empty day
Just going through the motions
Like a shadow on the ocean
Without you life has never been the same
I think of when it stormed we hit the country stove
Hot brandy round the fire with our friends
I'd kiss the rain drops from your eyes
Remembering I realized how much I'd want to walk with you again
So I wondered was I crazy
When I felt your hand in mine
Did you visit me from heaven
So I could touch you one more time
On Silverado Trail
I felt your words and in your touch you let me know
There's no reason I should suffer one more day
You said I loved you now, I loved you then
Now open up your heart again
And then I felt you softly fade away
And I know I wasn't crazy
When I held your hand in mine
You came down to me from heaven
And we went walking one last time
On Silverado Trail
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
