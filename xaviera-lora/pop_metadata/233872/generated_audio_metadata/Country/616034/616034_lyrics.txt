One day here, the next day gone
Never know when they're coming round here again
These better days
Oh, these better days
Here at last they're moving fast
Don't wait too long or they'll be past these days
These better days
Oh these better days
One day here, the next day gone
Never know when they're coming round here again
These better days
Oh, these better days
