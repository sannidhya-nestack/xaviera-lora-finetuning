Static on the speaker, waiting for his fart
I can feel the future, humming in the dark
Press play on the moment, palms against the glass
Every second bending, begging not to pass
We're counting down like it's one, two, three
Your voice is the beat that's rescuing me
Boom boom shake the room
Let the walls remember our names
Boom boom shake the room
Set the silence up in flames
When the world turns quiet
We'll still keep cutting through
Boom boom shake the room
I find my rhythm with you
We traded all the maybes for a solid line
Tangled in the treble pulling through the time
Every little heartbeat writes another verse
Only getting louder never in reverse
Hands up high as the record spins
Every lost beginning finds the place it ends
Boom boom shake the room
Let the walls remember our names
Boom boom shake the room
Set the silence up in flames
When the world turns quiet
We'll still keep cutting through
Boom boom shake the room
I found my room with you
If the dial drifts away, we'll pull it back to the line
We'll shout'til the frequency feels every word of the rhyme
No echo dies when two hearts collide
We keep it alive, we keep it alive
Boom boom shake the room set the walls remember our names
Boom boom shake the room set the silence up in place
When tomorrow's chapters need another breakthrough
Boom boom shake the room
I find my rhythm with you
Boom boom shake the room
We find our rhythm in you
