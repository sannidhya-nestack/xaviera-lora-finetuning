We've been driving so long I feel a part of this road
Nothing changes but the angle of the sun
Dozing in and out dreaming about the next show
Cause I can't wait to face the bright lights again
When I'm twisting, turning, my head is spinning
Eyes are burning, in no time I come to find
The ride is driving me crazy, hazy
My heart is thumping, blood is pumping
Crowd is screaming with delight
For each second I'm alive
After driving all day we pull up to the stadium
Unloading is the calm before the storm
Three generations of riding bulls are racing through my veins
Not much longer and my whole world explodes
I'll be twisting, turning, my head is spinning, eyes are burning
In no time I come to find the ride is driving me
Crazy, hazy, my heart is thumpin'
Blood is pumpin'
Crowd is screamin' with delight
4-H sicker on time alive
Strapping in for battle, I finally give the nod
The gate flies open and it's home
And I'm twistin', turnin', my head is spinnin'
Eyes are burnin', in no time, I come to find
The ride is drivin' me crazy, lazy
My heart is thumpin', blood is pumpin'
Crowd is screamin' with delight
I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
For 8 seconds, I'm alive
