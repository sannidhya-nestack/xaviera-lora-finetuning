I'm not the centerpiece in your collection
But you know I don't mind it
Tell me what you want
I'll go and get it
I know you're gonna like it
I'll bet you're looking good as sin
Just like you are to any man
Would be tempted
Move me up your list a little higher
Maybe then you'll see I'll be your best yet
Oh, you got me in your back pocket
You throw me in a fire I don't wanna put out
Oh, you got me in your back pocket
I'm good where I'm at'cause I've got the best seat in the house
I like the view from your back pocket
I'm sitting on the bench until you call me
Yes I know I'm your wild card
Tell me once again how I'm important
Even though you're playing loose with my heart
Oh, you've got me in your back pocket
You throw me in a fire I don't wanna put out
Oh, you've got me in your back pocket
I'm good where I'm at'cause I've got the best seat in the house, yeah
I like the view from your back pocket
Mm-hmm
I like the view from your back pocket
Oh, I'm good where I'm at
I've got the best seat in the house
I like the view from your back pocket
Yes, I do
Mmm, I like the view from your back pocket
Mmm, looking good from here
Oh I like the view from your back pocket
