Somebody stole a railroad line, didn't take'em long to find out
Me I was riding on a fine line, I never knowed I was heading for the dropout
The CID are asking me
Well I don't know
Tell me where the rail line can go
No!
Somebody stole a railroad line
Isn't it a disgrace?
And he took the bears off the family in the chairs
There's a frown on the station master's face
I keep telling them I don't know
Tell me where the real life could go
I don't know
Somebody has stolen a railroad line
Out car got a guilty smile
Manly shirts his head and underneath his bed
Looking for the missing miles
Ooh wee
The special branch are asking me
I keep telling them I don't know
Tell me where the real American go
You know that cops can't catch the criminals
Somebody must go to jail
For the seemingly lunatic larceny
Of fifty miles of British rail
Ooooooooh eee
The CID keep asking me
I keep telling them I don't know
Tell me where the railroad could go
I don't know
Somebody stole a railroad line, didn't take'em long to find out
Me, I was riding on a fine line
I never know what I was heading for the dropout
Ooh-wee
The CID keep asking me
I keep telling them I don't know
Tell me where the real light could go
Tell me where the real road,'cause I don't know
Tell me where the real road,'cause I don't know
Tell me where the real night,'cause I don't know
Tell me where the real road,'cause I don't know
Tell me where the real night,'cause I don't know
Cause I don't know, tell me where the red light goes (tell me where the red light goes)
Cause I don't know, tell me where the road goes (tell me where the road goes)
Cause I don't know, tell me where the red light goes (tell me where the red light goes)
Cause I don't know, tell me where the red light goes (tell me where the red light goes)
Cause I don't know, tell me where the red light goes
