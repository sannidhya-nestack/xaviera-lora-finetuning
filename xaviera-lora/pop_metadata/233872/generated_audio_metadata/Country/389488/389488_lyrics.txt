I was out having fun with my girls on a Saturday night
When I heard around the way with the boys you were talking real tight
Got your eyes on a prize some new girl wants a piece of your heart
So you're thinking in your head that it's time for a brand new start
And I remember my mama saying
If a man wants to go just let him go
they never know what they got until it's gone
Who's gonna love you the way that I do
Who packs the best love from here to the moon
Who's gonna hold you tighter than these arms of mine
Nobody like me
Nobody like me
Nobody like me
Nobody like me
If there's one single thing in this world that I want you to see
It's that you're the only one, you're the only one man for me
But if you can't control your heart it's got a mind of its own
I ain't nobody's fool, I'll just have to let you go
So you hear the whistle blowin'
But you're not sure if you're goin'
Well, you better take aim'cause you're about to lose the game
Who's gonna love you the way that I do?
Who packs the best stuff from here to the moon?
Who's gonna hold you tighter than these arms of mine?
Nobody like me, nobody like me, nobody like me, nobody like me
So come on let's go paint the town
My time's all wasting just talking round
Goodbye means nothing when you got nowhere to go
You ain't gonna find nobody like me
Who's gonna love you the way that I do
Who packs the best love from here to the moon
Who's gonna hold you tighter than these arms of mine
Nobody like me, nobody like me, nobody like me, nobody like me
Nobody like me (Nobody like me)
Nobody like me (Nobody like me)
Nobody like me (Nobody like me)
Nobody like me (Nobody like me)
Nobody like me (Nobody like me)
Nobody like me (Nobody like me)
Nobody like me (Nobody like me)
Nobody like me
