Johnny was my best friend
I always looked up to him
We played cops and robbers
It was us against the wind
Becky was in her yard
We rolled by and felt a spark
He pedaled slower, tipped us over
Oh man did we fall hard
That girl she stole our heart
Well, we went everywhere together
And I'm so glad we met her
She was a super girl in our Batman and Robin world
Oh how the three of us would fly
When I knew from the look in her eyes
It was Becky and John and I was along for the ride
Johnny bought a beat up Dodge
Watched him fix it in the garage
His smiling face told me things would change
That hot rod was supercharged
Becky joined his racing team
I became a memory
They drove to school seventeen and cool
Being left behind was hard
As they drove off in that car
Now we went everywhere together
And I'm so glad we met her
She was a super girl in a Batman and Robin world
Oh how the three of us would fly
But I knew from the look in her eyes
It was Becky and John and I was along for the ride
Haven't popped a wheelie in years
My flat tire flew somewhere
Covered in dust, spokes covered in rust
I gave up thinking that you would still care
Johnny's son came for a visit
Heard him say that he could fix it
Some elbow grease, now we rule the streets
Those bad guys better beware
We're one neat crime fighting pair
Now we go everywhere together
These days I'm feeling better
It's so much like his mama and his dad
Oh, how we would fly
I knew from the look in her eyes
It was Becky and John and I wasn't long for the ride
But I would still let a boy's turn
Take me along for the ride
Oh, no, no, no, no
Take me along for the ride
