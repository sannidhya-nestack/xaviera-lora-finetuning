You wanna party? I find it's too hard to stop
Don't get me started, I need to get to my job
Why don't you step off, my bills are weighing me down
What did you call me? I am the wildest around
If you wanna get crazy baby let's have some fun
Boom goes the dynamite, bang goes the gun
Boom goes the dynamite, bang goes the gun
Let's get this party started, baby, there goes the sun
Nothing in the cooler, so let's go on the run
Boom goes the dynamite, bang goes the gun
You lit my fuse, I think I'm ready to pop
It's getting wild here, the neighbors make up cops
I think I know'em, they like to party with chicks
That's how we do it, getting down in the sticks
It's not even your birthday but I brought you some fun
Boom goes the dynamite, bang goes the gun
Boom goes the dynamite, bang goes the gun, yeah
This party's started baby, there goes the sun
Nothing in the cooler, so let's go on a run
Boom goes the dynamite, bang goes the gun
Boom goes the dynamite, bang goes the gun
Boom goes the dynamite, bang goes the gun
Boom goes the dynamite, bang goes the gun
Boom goes the dynamite, bang goes the gun
Boom goes the dynamite, bang goes the gun
Boom goes the dynamite, bang goes the gun
Boom goes the dynamite, bang goes the gun
Boom goes the dynamite, bang goes the gun
Boom goes the dynamite bang goes the gun
Let's get this party started baby there goes the sun
Nothing in the cooler so let's go for a run
Boom goes the dynamite bang goes the gun
Boom goes the dynamite bang goes the gun
Boom goes the dynamite bang goes the gun
Boom goes the dynamite bang goes the gun
