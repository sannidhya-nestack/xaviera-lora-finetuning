She grew up believing love was all she needed
So she married young to a poor boy from her hometown in Abilene
Worked real hard to earn the poor man's dollar
Had two kids and one on the way just another mouth to feed
But it didn't take too long until it was too hard to hold on
But she had too much of too little for too long
Still she wants to do right, be strong, have faith
Even when her dreams are not in sight
And lonely love can't keep her holding on
She's had too much of too little for too long
And now she knows life is just what you make it
A little bit older and still in love with that boy from Abilene
She smiles and turns the bad times into good
They don't have a lot but what they've got is everything she needs
And now when times get hard
Love gives her the strength to hold on
She's had too much of too little for too long
Still she wants to do right, be strong, have faith
Even when her dreams are not in sight
And only love can keep her holding on
She's had too much of too little for too long
Now when times get hard
Look is her the strength to hold on
She's had too much of too little for too long
Still she wants to do right, be strong, have faith
Even when her dreams are not in sight
And only love can keep her holding on
She's had too much of too little for too long
For too long
For too long
