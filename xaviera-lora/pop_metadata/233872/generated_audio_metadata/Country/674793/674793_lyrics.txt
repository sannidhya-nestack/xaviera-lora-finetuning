Oh, Mr. Mister, don't confuse yourself
You're not meant to be with anyone else
You're really such a drama queen
But that's exactly what I need
someday you're gonna wake up feeling ill
Close your brakes, rolling down a hill
Feel the rain falling down
But don't frown'cause look, I'm here for you
If your skies are grey or blue
When I look, I brush her umbrella
And I cake, just in case, just in case
You're a glass half empty kinda guy
But I'm your favourite slice of apple pie
You might find it hard to see the sun
But don't worry, my work's not done
someday you're gonna wake up feeling ill
Close your brakes, rollin' down a hill
See the rain fallin' down
But don't frown'cause look, I'm here for you
If your skies are gray or blue, and look
I brought a umbrella and a cake just in case, just in case
We aren't exactly two peas in a pod
But our love ain't any kind of a sod
Granted, we're gonna have some days that are bad
But it's gonna take some work
it's love and not just some fed
Someday you're gonna wake up feeling ill
Lose your brakes, rollin' down a hill
Feel the rain fallin' down
But don't frown'cause look
I'm here for you
If your skies are gray or blue, well look
Her bras, her umbrella, and a cake just in case, just in case
Da da da da da da da da ba da da da
Da da da da da da da ba da da da oh yeah
