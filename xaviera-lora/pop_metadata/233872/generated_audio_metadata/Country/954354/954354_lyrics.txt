I was broke down on love's highway
Waiting to get sold away
When you came along like a beautiful song
And gave my heart a jump start
I wanna thank you for loving me
You rock my world and you set me free
I thank the good lord for the food I eat
And I thank you for loving me (thank you)
Thanking you (for loving me)
For loving me
Loving me
It was easy falling hard for you
Wasn't much I had to do
All my reservations got erased
The second I saw your face
I wanna thank you for loving me
Rocked my world and you set me free
I thank the good lord for the food I eat
And I thank you for loving me
Thanking you for loving me
I wanna thank you for loving me
I could live to a hundred and one
eternity calls my bluff
But forever would never be time enough
So, who's the new backup singer?
Can we get through one song without you flirting with a backup singer?
Be my Venus, I'll be your Mars
Dancing underneath the stars
Climb up Jacob's ladder where the sky is clear
Swing from heaven's chandelier
I wanna thank you for loving me
You rock my world and you set me free
I thank the good lord for the food I eat
And I thank you for loving me
You rock my world and you set me free
I thank the good lord for the food I eat
And I thank you for loving me (thank you)
Thanking you for loving me (for loving me)
And me, thanking you for loving me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
