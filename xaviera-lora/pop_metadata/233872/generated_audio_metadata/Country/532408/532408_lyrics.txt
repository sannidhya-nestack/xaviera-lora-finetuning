This morning I looked in the mirror
I saw uncombed hair, bloodshot eyes and a weak old beard
Man I've been down but it's time to live again
I won't let her leave and send my life into a spin
I'm gonna turn myself around, get on solid ground
Pull my chin up off my chest can't let this drag me down
Some love's not meant to last so it's best left in the past
There's no turning back gonna turn myself around
A long hot shower and a real close shave
Clean white shirt, shined up shoes, I feel like I've been saved
The man I saw in the mirror won't show his face no more
I'm kicking off my misery, time to open up tomorrow's door
I'm gonna turn myself around
Get on solid ground
Pull my chin up off my chest
Can't let this drag me down
Some love's not meant to last
So it's best left in the past
There's no turning back
Gonna turn myself around
So today I buy a brand new truck
Put a horseshoe on its grill for luck
Cause now it's time for moving on
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm gonna turn myself around
Get on solid ground
Pull my chin up off my chest
Can't let this drag me down
Some love's not meant to last
So it's best left in the past
There's no turning back
Gonna turn myself around
I'm gonna turn myself around
Get on solid ground
Never looking back when I turn myself around
