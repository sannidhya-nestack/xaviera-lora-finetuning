He's just left his home and he's out on the roam
He's a lady killer and the world's all his own
Prefers married gals and won't hesitate
Your first one with him will be your last date
His six-pack's exposed and his pics are on deck
And from hundreds of gals only he can select
The words hit the street, his rep is known wide
So girls hold your ground and don't let him slide
He's a mother hugger all dressed in black
He'll love you and leave you so you better watch your back
He's sweet as can be and he'll get you to swoon
But bet your sweet booty he's gone before noon
He's a mother hugger
He can lasso a woman with his hands at his back
He's a sidewinding dealer and never looks back
He'll get you to loving, then just leave you flat
Then he's gone in a flash and he's covered his tracks
He's a mother hugger all dressed in black
He'll love you and leave you so you better watch your back
He's sweet as can be and he'll get you to swoon
But bet your sweet booty he's gone before noon
He's a mother hugger
Romeo cowboy
One night stand
Roll me up cowboy
Honky tonk man yeah yeah
He's a mother hugger all dressed in black
He'll love you and leave you so you better watch your back
He's sweet as can be and he'll get you to swoon
But betcha sweet booty he's gone before noon
He's a mother hugger
He's a mother, mother hugger
Yeah, yeah, yeah
