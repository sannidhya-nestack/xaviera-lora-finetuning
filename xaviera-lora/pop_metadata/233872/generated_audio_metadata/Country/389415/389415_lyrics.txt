Sitting home alone uptight
Call that woman to make things right
A loving voice says come and stay tonight
I'd been living too much in the past
Afraid tomorrow might be my last
She tells me baby today is all we have, all we have
You make me the man I want to be
Victoria, just like a breeze
You set me free
You set me free
You're the woman that makes me strong
I found the will to carry on
I write the music, baby, you're the song
You make me the man I want to be
Victoria just like a breeze
You set me free
You set me free
Loving seemed like such a losing game
Brought me sorrow left me pain
Victoria like a gentle rain
Washed it all away
You washed it all away
You make me the man I want to be
Oh, Victoria, just like a breeze
You set me free
Girl, you set me free
You set me free
You set me
Be free
