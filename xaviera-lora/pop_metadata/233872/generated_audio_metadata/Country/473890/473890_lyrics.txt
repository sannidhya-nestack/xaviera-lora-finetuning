Monday morning, pouring rain
Got to work late cause the power was out
Missed a big meeting, had the worst migraine
To top it off, the boss chews me out
Stopped for a drink to end the day
Told my worries to the barkeep and heard him say
Hey, sounds like a lot of small stuff
See that man sitting there in the corner
His baby's in children's hospital
She's gonna pull through what a close call
He'll have a couple drinks while on a break
His wife hasn't watched him too late
He lost his job when they closed the mill
Sold their house to pay off the bills
Yeah I know you had a bad day
But it all sounds like a lot of small stuff
Paid my tab, called my wife
She said she had a flat on the boulevard
The kids have been acting up all night
The dog dragged the trash through the yard
Said honey I know you had one of those days
But let me tell you it's a blessing in many ways
Sounds like a lot of small stuff
There's a man sitting here in the corner
His baby's in children's hospital
She's gonna pull through with a closed car
He'll have a couple drinks while on the break
His wife has a watch until 8
He lost his job when they closed the mill
Sold their house to pay off the bills
Yeah I know you had a bad day
But it all sounds like a lot of small stuff
Going through the line at the store this morning
Thumbing through the tab, lords, I stopped and read
Hollywood couples splitting up again
I can hear that barkeep saying
Sounds like a lot of small stuff
See that man sitting there in the corner
His baby's in children's hospital
She's gonna pull through, what a close call
He'll have a couple drinks while on a break
His wife hasn't watched'em too late
He lost his job when they closed the mill
Sold their house to pay off the bills
Yeah, I know you had a bad day
But it all sounds like a lot of small stuff
Yeah, I know you had one of those days
But it all sounds like a lot of small stuff
