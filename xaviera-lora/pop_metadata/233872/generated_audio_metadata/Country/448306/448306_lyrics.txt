I'm just an average jerk in sixty hour weeks
Back to back on this factory floor
And at a boy roast my boss is worth saying
That he's happy but he'll always dig more
I think it's time I took a small vacation
I'm a little overdue for some relaxation
So hey Pensacola Beach, I'm heading your way
And I'll have Jimmy Buffett on the radio
My toes in the sand and I'm a-taking it slow
No one to tell me when to come and go this time
And I'll be getting good at having fun in the sun
I get a copper-toned tan and a bottle of rum
Leave all my worries and my troubles behind where it's nice
In my Pensacola paradise
The first thing I do when I'm rollin' the town
Is hit the floor of'Bama where I'bama'round
And eat a paparazzis and maybe take a walk on the beach
I know to spend all day staring up in the sky
Watching navy blue angels as they fly by
And then again wishing I was fishing on a three mile bridge
Tonight I'm missing Character's Cafe
Where we would listen to the songwriters as they play
Their original music while swaying to a tropical breeze
Now I've got Jimmy Buffet on my radio
My toes in the sand and I'm a taking it slow
No one to tell me when to come and go
This time it's so fine
I'm getting good at having fun in the sun
I've got a copper-toned tan and a bottle of rum
Left all my worries and my troubles behind in the skies
In my pizza cola paradise
Now I've got Jimmy Buffett on the radio
My toes in the sand and I'm a taking it slow
No one to tell me when to come and go
This time it's a fine
I'm getting good at having fun in the sun
I've got a copper-toned tan and a bottle of rum
Left all my worries and my troubles behind in this dice
In my Pensacola paradise
Pensacola paradise
In my Pensacola paradise
