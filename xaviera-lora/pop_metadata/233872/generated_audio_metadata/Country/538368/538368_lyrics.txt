Well, I thumbed a button and the motor growled
Slipped leather on the clutch and started to frown
Shoved the gear stick forward and let off in the shoe
And thirty-six tons started to move
Hauled out of Sydney doing twenty-five
Man, but I'm sick of this truck driving life
My eyes are sore and I'm feeling down
I wish I was home and at a late town
Big rig blues, big rig blues
Got'em bad them big rig blues
Everything I try to do goes wrong
Out in the highway doing sixty an hour
Looked in the mirror and saw that car
Heard a siren wail, started to swear
And the man said, "Hey Mac, pull over there"
Back on the road now, my temper is bad with the ticker for speedin' now, ain't that sad
When I saw a sign and the words did say, "Slow down brother, you're expected to wait"
Big rig blues, big rig blues, got'em bad damn big rig blues
Everything I try to do goes wrong
I felt like crying but I started to curse
That back road I took sure made things worse
An overloading fine could be a hundred bucks
A man can't win when he's down on his luck
I rolled that rig into Adelaide town
And shut off the motor and climbed sadly down
Went up to the man for my wages
Do said get another jockey cause I'm sure through
Big rig blues, big rig blues
Got'em bad, them big rig blues
Everything I try to do goes wrong
I give'em the tickets and he walked away said
Hold on a minute there, I'll fix your pay
Came out of the office, "Hey Mike," said
Anytime you pay these fines, you'll owe money to me
Big rig blues, big rig blues
Got'em bad, them big rig blues
Everything I try to do goes wrong
