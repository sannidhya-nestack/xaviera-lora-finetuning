My back's against the wall
But I don't mind at all
My knees are weak and I'm about to fall
I can't wait no more
What you're worth waiting for
It's a world where the girl
Picks the hand of the man she wants
Whatever it takes
Whatever you need
If ever you stray
Wherever you lead
Whatever you say
Why that's the way it'll be
Before my heart breaks
Make no mistake
Whatever it takes
Treat me like a dog
Won't need a leash too long
Where you go I'll follow
I'll be your good boy when you're gone
And for a piece of your heart
Baby I'll beg and I'll bond
What you say I'll obey your command is the plan I walk
Whatever it takes, whatever you need
If ever you stray, wherever you lead
Whatever you say, why that's the way it'll be
Before my heart breaks make no mistake, whatever it takes
You can call it whatever you want
But all I want is you
Whatever it takes (whatever it takes)
Whatever you need (whatever you need)
If ever you stray
Wherever you lead
Whatever you say (whatever you say)
Why ask the way it'll be (why ask the way)
Before my heart breaks
Make no mistake
Whatever it takes
Before my heart breaks
Make no mistake
Whatever
