Six foot one and calloused, daddy worked the land
Cutting wood, chopping cotton, building things by hand
Out in the field at sunup with a biscuit and a coffee cup
You knew where you would find him and you knew where he would stand
But daddy had his weakness, every man does
Some they like to smoke and drink, some are known to cuss
Some men have to roam and ramble, others have to cheat and gamble
Daddy had his weakness sure enough
Yeah, daddy's weakness was us
Our mama was a soft spot, his Achilles heel
He always asked what she was thinking, always cared how she would feel
When his buddies came around and said, "Hey, let's go to town"
If she said a fence needs mending, he'd get'em all out in the field
'Cause daddy had his weakness, every man does
Some they like to smoke and drink, and some are known to curse
Some men have to roam and ramble, others have to cheat and gamble
Daddy had his weakness, sure enough
Yeah, daddy's weakness was us
I'm gonna raise my children the same way he raised me
And like my daddy, my weakness will be my family
Well my daddy wasn't easy, he stood firm and he drew the line
But he became a big softy if he thought he'd made me cry
And I was stubborn in my way, and I sure made mistakes
But he'd pick me up and dust me off and say, "Give it one more try"
Yeah daddy had his weakness
Every man does
Some they like to smoke and drink
Some are known to cuss
Some men have to roam and ramble
Others have to cheat and gamble
Daddy had his weakness sure enough
Yeah, daddy's weakness was us
We were daddy's weakness
Yeah, we were daddy's weakness
