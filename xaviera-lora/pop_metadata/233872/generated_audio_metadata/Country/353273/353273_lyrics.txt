For twenty long years I've lived a high life
Too stupid to see what is real
I've been searching for what doesn't exist
Too drunk and numb to feel
Waiting there for my lucky break
But too blind to see the signs I was holding on
To nothing good, a lonely desperate life
It's you that makes me wanna be better than I have to be
It's you that makes me feel I can rise above
It's you that makes me wanna see
A soberer man, a better me
It's you that makes me feel I can rise above
I was dying there with no chance to survive
No vision and a clouded mind I was thinking of
No one but me and you stood by my side
I'm giving up what I never had
Just a dream that's fading fast
I'm living life day by day
And I ain't looking back
It's you that makes me wanna be
Better than I have to be
It's you that makes me feel I can rise above
It's you that makes me wanna see
A sober man, a better me
It's you that makes me feel I can rise above
It's you that makes me wanna be
Better than I have to be
It's you that makes me feel I can rise above
It's you that makes me wanna see
A sober man, a better me
It's you that makes me feel I can rise above
I can rise above
It's you that makes me feel I can rise above
