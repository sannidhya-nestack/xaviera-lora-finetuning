Let me down easy if you go
For I don't like to play the fool
Yeah but the truth is there ain't no other way
Let me down easy if you go
And speak softly when you say
That you won't stay with me forever
Say the words so that they hang in the air
Say'em softly, walk away
Like it or not, here comes a heartache
Nothing we can say can stop the coming tears
What have I done? Is there a mistake?
Hey now my love is leaving here, like it or not
This whole thing's dying, and nothing we can do
Stop love once it goes
Like it or not, you're doing all the talking
And I'm just listening, now you know
Like it or not
Here comes a heartache
And nothing we can say
Stop the coming tears
What have I done?
Is there a mistake?
And now my love is leaving me here
And like it or not
This whole thing was dying
And nothing we can do
Could stop love once it goes
Like it or not
You're doing all the talking
And my heart's breaking, now you know
Let me down easy if you go
For I don't like to play the fool
