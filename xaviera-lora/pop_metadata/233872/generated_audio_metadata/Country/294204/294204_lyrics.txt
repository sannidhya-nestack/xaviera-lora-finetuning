I dreamed about you long before we met
And prayed a girl like you I'd someday get
But now there's something that I must admit
You're not what I had in mind
Things aren't working like I thought they should
It hasn't happened how I hoped it would
I didn't see it being quite this good
Having you in my life
I underestimated loving you
I didn't know that love could be so true
You're looking at a man who's truly blessed
Far beyond what I'd have ever guessed
I wonder what it was that I did right
Every time we hold each other tight
You know I never really had a clue
I underestimated loving you
I never knew a kiss could taste so sweet
Or how my heart could skip so many beats
And just how far you'd knock me off my feet
With your beautiful smile
But when you hit me with those big brown eyes
It never fails to take me by surprise
It isn't long before I realize
Just how lucky I am
I underestimated loving you
I didn't know that love could be so true
You're looking at a man who's truly blessed
Far beyond what I'd have ever guessed
I wonder what it was that I did right
Every time we hold each other tight
You know I never really had a clue
I underestimated loving you
You know I never really had a clue
I underestimated loving you
