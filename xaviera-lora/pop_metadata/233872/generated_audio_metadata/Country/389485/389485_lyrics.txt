A winner, a loser, or all that I am
Kinda depends on the weather man
Believed in the words of the ones in command
And now I don't give a damn
I'm not saying I'm better than you
I'm not saying I'm better than he
I'm not saying I'm better than you, my friend
There's just no one that's better, better than me
The prince and the pauper, they're really the same
The rich man, the poor man, it's all one big game
It's not what you are, but what you do leads to fame
Ain't that a crying shame?
I'm not saying I'm better than you
I'm not saying I'm better than him
I'm not saying I'm better than you, my friend
There's just no one that's better
Better than me
Learned it's really okay to let go
A light shining inside, let it show
I'm no more, I'm no less
Than anyone else from the soul
I just want you to know
I'm not sayin' I'm better than you
I'm not sayin' I'm better than him
I'm not sayin' I'm better than you, my friend
There's just no one that's better
There's just no one that's better, better than me
Better than me, yeah
I'm not sayin' I'm better
I'm not saying I'm better
