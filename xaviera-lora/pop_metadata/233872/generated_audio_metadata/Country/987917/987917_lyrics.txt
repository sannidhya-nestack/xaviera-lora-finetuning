You can go to hell, I'm going to Texas
Texas is a place I dearly love
Oh, you can go to hell, I'm going to Texas
And if you ever make it down, don't look me up
Moved up here with you to Chicago
Guess I'd followed you most anywhere
But this bitter wind and your cold heart cut me to the bone
So I'm gonna let it blow me back home to San Antonio
You can go to hell, I'm going to Texas
Texas is a place I dearly love
Oh, you can go to hell, I'm going to Texas
And if you ever make it down, don't look me up
Hammered down my pickup through Tennessee
I still see you in the rear view of my mind
Five hundred miles of hurting won't bring no relief
'Til that red river runs somewhere between you and me
You can go to hell, I'm going to Texas
Texas is a place I dearly love
Oh, you can go to hell, I'm going to Texas
And if you ever make it down, don't look me up
And if you ever make it down, don't look me up
