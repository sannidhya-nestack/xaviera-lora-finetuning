My 18 wheeler is a-cussin' and a-smokin'
Loggin' miles from Memphis to Hoboken
This lonely cab is closin' in
Since my Chelsea's death I find it hard to live again
Fourteen happy years Chelsea rode up front with me
Singing country songs from LA to Tennessee
Harmonizing vocals with the radio all the day
She filled my life with such joy it took my breath away
When she sings, she takes my soul to heaven
Chelsea's earned her wings in the celestial jamboree
I can feel her presence
Sitting right here by my side
Riding shotgun with the angels and me
Banglin' from the rear view hangs a picture of my wife
Chelsea passed on Easter when cancer took her life
We'd go to the Grand Ole Opry every chance that we could get
She lived her life to the fullest and I have no regrets
Now Chelsea lives in heaven with the stars from long ago
I hear her singing next to me along with my radio
It soothes my soul to know she's found peace in afterlife
Hobnobbing with the country stars'til the wee hours of the night
When she sings she takes my soul to heaven
And Chelsea's earned her wings in the celestial jamboree
I can feel her presence sitting right here by my side
Riding shotgun with the angels and me
Chelsea sends me messages that comfort and console
Reminds me of the fun we had
And lives within my soul
When she sings
She takes my soul to heaven
Chelsea's earned her wings
In the celestial jamboree
I can feel her presence
Sitting right here by my side
Riding shotgun with the angels and me
Riding shotgun with the angels and me
