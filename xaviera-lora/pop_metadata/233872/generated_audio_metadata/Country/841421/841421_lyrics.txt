Every workday morning I go through the same routine
Coffee, shave and shower, pack my lunch and leave
She's standing by the front door wearing nothing but my shirt
One look and I start talking myself out of going to work
Somebody stop me
I don't wanna go
I must be crazy
To leave her here alone
Hold me down, tie me up
I'll leave her by the rope
Somebody stop me
I don't wanna go
I took her in my arms and carried her back up the stairs
In the middle of a kiss I heard ringing in my ears
Well it's the darn alarm clock waking me at five AM
The whole thing was a dream it's time to go to work again
Somebody stop me
I don't wanna go
I must be crazy
To leave her here alone
Hold me down, tie me up
I'll leave her by the rope
Somebody stop me
I don't wanna go
Saturday I couldn't wait to go fishing
But after she kissed me goodbye
I started wishing somebody'd stop me
I don't wanna go
I must be crazy to leave her here alone
Hold me down, tie me up
I'll leave her by the rope
Somebody stop me
I don't wanna go
Hold me down, tie me up, I'll leave'em by the rope
Somebody stop me, I don't wanna go
