Been on the road, so long gone, missing my Texas home
Back and forth, around the north, to this bar stool all alone
Feeling confined, just killing time, till I can't head out west
And get back to that old bayou city I loved best
As I was about to call it a night
I caught a glimpse of her through the neon lights
She had a silk lace shirt, king ranch purse, blue casey boots and golden tan
Ruby red lips, tortilla chips, margarita in her hand
Big bright eyes like pecan pies
Said don't you tell me let me guess
You must be from Texas
Without a word she stood and turned
As if she had a plan
Set down her drink
Smiled and winked and pointed toward the band
Beat up her fate
They played G e Strait that's when I knew for sure
Her and me were meant to be as we two-step crossed the floor
We danced and talked until three AM
Said I learned a lot about you but tell me again
You love the rodeo, the Alamo country music and Dixieland
Have a southern drawl, say you all smile wider than the Rio Grande
Like armadillos and peanut brittle please tell me do
To confess you must be from Texas
She said it's been fun but I've got to run
Then she climbed into her truck
How's about me and you?
Some barbecue and some ice cold Scheiderbach
I said, "That'd be great, I can't wait, at your place or at mine"
She handed me a note she wrote with her address underlined
It said, "Had a good time on our first date, I'll see you real soon back in the Lone Star State"
She had a silk lace shirt, king ranch purse, blue casey boots and golden tan
Ruby red lips, tortilla chips, margarita in her hand
Big bright eyes like pecan pie, said don't you tell me let me guess
You must be from Texas
Yeah you must be from Texas
You couldn't be from anywhere else but Texas
