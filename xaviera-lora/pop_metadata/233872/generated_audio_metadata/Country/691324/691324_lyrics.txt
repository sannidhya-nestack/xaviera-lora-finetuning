If you're tired of all the green horns
You're looking for a change
I can steer you straight
Home on the range
I'm wild as the wind
Hotter than a pepper sauce
And I just wanna be your rocking horse
I don't wanna fence you in or be your trail boss
You're the sweetest cowgirl I've ever come across
So saddle up, saddle in, don't take your spurs off
Baby let me be your rocking horse
In the rodeo of life you gotta hold on to the reins
To keep yourself from falling into the pain
I don't wanna get hitched up or be double crossed
I just wanna be your rocking horse
I don't wanna fence you in or be your trail boss
You're the sweetest cowgirl I've ever come across
So saddle up, settle in, don't take your spurs off
Maybe let me be your rocking horse
No, I don't want to pinch you in or be your trail boss
You're the sweetest cowgirl I've ever come across
So settle up, settle in, don't take your spurs off
Baby, let me be your rocking horse
Whoa, baby, let me be your rocking horse
Baby, let me be your rocking horse
