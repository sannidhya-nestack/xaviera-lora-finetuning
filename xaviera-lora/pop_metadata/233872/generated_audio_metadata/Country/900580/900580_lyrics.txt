Closer than two high bees tangled up and buzzing
Nestled in on weekends keep the honey running
Girl I count the minutes I'm alone with you
Snuggling on the sofa
Talking and touching
Out on the screened-in
Hot tub and loving
All the things you do to me
Makes me come alive
Living for a downtime
Downtime
We can stroll down on a beach in Nassau, Bahamas
Sit on our back porch all day in our pajamas
Watch the birds at the feeders play
And the squirrels climb
We're living for downtime
Downtime
And I wish every man alive could have a love in his life like I do
But then again I don't think that there's another woman in this world like you
So I'll keep sneaking up behind you while you're cooking in the kitchen
Biting on your earlobe, fingers crossed wishing you'd get the gooses
Let the cooking slide, living for downtime, downtime
Downtime on a beach or a cruise to the Bahamas
Sitting on the back porch all day in our pajamas
Watching birds at the feeders play and the squirrels climb
Waiting on the night
We're living for downtime
Waitin' all the night
We're livin' for downtime
Yeah, we're waitin' all the night
Livin' for downtime
