There's blinking lights in the distance telling me this time I'm gonna win
The cards are changing, I feel it, this time it's gonna be different
Got a rusty El Camino 1981
Driving fast like a magnet
Vegas is gonna give me some
Give me some easy, easy money
Count my lucky stars
Easy, easy money
Got my lucky charms
Gonna roll the dice
Won't think twice
It'll be so nice
To get my slice
My luck is finally changing like a psychic said it would
I'll ditch this car in the desert and buy me something brand new
And finally taste some caviar, I hear it's something good
Sell my house and move into a better neighborhood
With my easy, easy money I've got my lucky charms
Easy, easy money
Count my lucky stars
Gonna roll the dice
Won't think twice
It'll be so nice
To get my slice
Spend the day at the spa
Eat at a five star restaurant
Have everything I dreamed of
Everything I want
He said, he said my name
And I've got my lucky charms
Easy, easy money
Can't count my lucky stars
Easy, easy money
Can't got my lucky charms
Easy, easy money
Count my lucky stars
Gonna roll the dice
Won't think twice
It'll be so nice
To get my slice
