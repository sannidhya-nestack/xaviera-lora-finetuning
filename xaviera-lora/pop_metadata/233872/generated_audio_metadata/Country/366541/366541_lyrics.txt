I picked her up about 8 .30
Dressed up and ready for love
She wore her tight red dress and her stockings
With her high heel shoes and stuff
I took her to a club where a band played
They played such a serious groove
She looked so good, I said, "Let's go home"
And then she started to move it
And now my baby, yeah my baby
Yes, my baby wants to stay here and dance
Outside I had a taxi waiting
For our quick getaway
And at home I'd put clean sheets on the bed
Hopin' my baby might stay
Well, I looked all around to find her
With her cold, hair in my hand
And I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw her
Dancing on stage with her grand
And now my baby
Yeah, my baby
I said, my baby
Wants to stay here and dance
Look at her shake that stuff, oh look at that woman go
There's no way I'm gonna go take her home
Well, I guess I'll go home on my own
Hey, hey, my baby
Hey, my baby
Ah, yeah, my baby
Ah, come
All right, I said my baby
Yeah, my baby (shake it, shake it, baby)
Oh, my baby wants to stay here and dance
Come on, yeah, I said my baby
Hey, my baby (shake it, shake it baby)
Oh, you know my baby
I said my baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Baby
All right, ah, come on
Baby
Shake it, shake it, baby, yeah
I said my baby
