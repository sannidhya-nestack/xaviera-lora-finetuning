Now's Beulah from Master Beulah
Crazed as she was wild
She get your motor running
Then she take it for a ride
She said she wasn't married
But I discovered that she lied
When her husband, the local sheriff
Put some buckshot in my hide
Now I'll count all my blessings
From one to ninety-five
With all these crazy women and men I'm lucky to be alive
I'm lucky to be standing here I'm lucky I survived
So I'm counting all my blessings from one to ninety five
Now there was Jenny from over Jenny
Fit as she was lean
Said she had a keeping shape
For problems yet unseen
But watch out if you crossed her
She turned ugly to fear some hate
From Winch, Bullard, Smith and Weston
I thought it best to split the scene
So I'm counting all my blessings from 1 to 95
All these crazy women, man, I'm lucky to be alive
I'm lucky to be standing here, I'm lucky I survived
So I'm counting all my blessings from 1 to 95
Now I've been around this big old world
I've seen some crazy things
But nothing can quite compare to the trouble that women bring
To a certain kinda crazy of a sweet insanity
Whatever you may call it, beat the hell right outta me
There was Lola from Meneola, local beauty queen
She had to be the prettiest gal that this man's ever seen
But when she got drankin', she start kickin' up a scene
They could fight
With anyone in sight and usually it was me
So I'm counting all my blessings from 195
For all these crazy women man I'm lucky to be alive
I'm lucky to be standing here I'm lucky I survived
So I'm counting all my blessings from 195
