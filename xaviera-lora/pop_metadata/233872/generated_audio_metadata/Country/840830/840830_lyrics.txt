Standing alone here without you
Watching my whole world fade to grey
Looking for something to hold on to
For the one that I once held has gone away
Searching for answers in the darkness
So full of questions in the light
Trying to make sense of all the pieces
But I can never resurrect what just has died
My heart is feeling like a ghost town
I am standing in the ruins of the way things used to be
In my mind I see your face
And as I look around this place
Those times all that's left are you and me
I start to shiver in the cold rain
Remembering all those nights you kept me warm
I guess my tears don't mean a damn thing
Our love's been damaged by the storm
My heart is feeling like a ghost town
I am standing in the ruins of the way things used to be
In my mind I see your face but as I look around this place
Oh, ghost towns all that's left of you and me
I've got to get away from here
Make all these memories disappear
Stop all those crazy voices in my head
I'm reaching out for something new
I can't keep holding on to you
A ghost town is the only thing that's left
The only survivors in a ghost town
Are the ones who turn their backs and walk away
A little voice inside my head says leave now
Girl get on your horse and ride it's not too late
My heart is feeling like a ghost town
I am standing in the ruins of the way things used to be
In my mind I see your face but as I look around this place
A ghost town's all that's left, a ghost town's all that's left
A ghost town's all that's left of you and me
How?
