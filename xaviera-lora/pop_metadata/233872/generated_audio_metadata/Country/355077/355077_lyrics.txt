Well it's just another night
Talking out our problems
It's just another fight
Don't think we can solve'em
Where do we go from here?
Why can't it just be clear
You're taking it all wrong
Don't walk away crying
It's gone on too long
Don't think I'm not trying
Well I guess it has to end today
Time to go our separate ways
No more calls on the telephone
This house doesn't feel like a home
I guess it's time for me to go
And learn the fine art of dining alone
So I spend my time
Looking for that perfect woman
Talking every line
Don't even move'em
I wonder can it be the same
The grass is greener so they say
But I'll keep on trying
To find the perfect lover
And I pray that I'll get by
Lord, will I find another?
Now there's no more bumps in the night
Got no one to hold me tight
No more calls on the telephone
This house doesn't feel like a home
I guess it's time for me to go
And learn the fine art of dining alone
Talk about it later
Lord I wish we'd have talked about it then
Ain't that the way it always goes
Over and over again
Now that old sunrise, it ain't so bright
Without my baby in my life
No more calls on the telephone
This house doesn't feel like a home
Well I guess it's time for me to go
And now I sit here all alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
