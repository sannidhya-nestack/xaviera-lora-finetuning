I'm happy with my lot now, darling, please
Be sticking to my skin like a disease
The thing about this negativity
Is that it gets the best of me
Hello, hello
Don't speak to me
I wonder on
But it cripples me
It's not blame saving, not at all
I need someone to break my fall
But you don't need no broken bones
Crashing down at 18 stone
I know, I know
It's no good for me
Oh on the on
Don't pity me
I burnt a few along the way
I never really understood
That fortune favours the brave
And that is something I am not
I'm riding on the wrong side of the road
I'll find a way to lighten my load
All around me are those potholes
They rip apart a part of my soul
Hello, hello
Don't speak to me
I'll wander on
But it cripples me
I know, I know, you're no good for me
I'll wander on
