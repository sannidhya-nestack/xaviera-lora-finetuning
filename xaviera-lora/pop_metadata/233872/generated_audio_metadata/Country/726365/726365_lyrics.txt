Mama, it ain't easy growing up
Don't know where to turn, I don't know where to run
And mama can you tell me why life seems so unfair
My daddy comes home every night while her daddy is fighting over there
And it's a crazy world
And I'm only just a girl
Trying to understand what's going on
But in this crazy world
Are you ever really old enough
To know what's right when things are going wrong?
Today at school I heard someone say
Just try one of these and everything will be okay
Daddy can you tell me what should I believe?
Does the flag still stand for freedom?
Are we living the American dream?
Well it's a crazy world
And I'm only just a girl
Trying to understand what's going on
But in this crazy world
Are you ever really old enough
To know what's right when things are going wrong
And tonight as I pray deep in my soul
For a crazy world there's still so much love at home
Well it's a crazy world
We're all trying to understand what is going on
And in this crazy world
Are you ever really old enough
To know what's right when things are going wrong?
