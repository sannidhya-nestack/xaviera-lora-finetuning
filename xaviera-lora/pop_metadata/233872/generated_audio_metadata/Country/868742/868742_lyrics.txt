Martha and Abel sat around the table late one night
Getting full of bourbon, finding it disturbing
They couldn't get high
Martha said, "What we need, baby, is some good old fashioned brew"
Let's make some moonshine
Give it a name like a fancy wine
Called Chateau Martha vintage'79
Abel left the table headed for a stable to get some grain
Martha got some berries, parts off the Chevy and plugged up the drain
Right there in the bathtub folks would come out with no surprise
One forty proof moonshine
That could clear your sinuses or bend your spine
Chateau Martha vintage'79
When word got around
Folks was even coming from out of town
Soon came the G-men, T-men and the C-men into town
Investigated and interrogated everyone they found
I saw one in the barnyard questionin' Mrs. Murphy's fate
He said, "You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning
And anything you say may be taken down against you in a court of law regarding"
She had told Martha Binti'79
Then Martha rolled into town
You got them revenuers to drink some down
Two days later they recuperated and all agreed
That her shine was certainly the finest
What they ever seen
They told Abel put a warning on the label
In accordance with the FDA
And it read
Be careful when you imbibe
Not to get it on your skin or in your eyes
Chateau Mar the vintage'70
Chateau Mar the vintage'70
Chateau Mar the vintage'79
