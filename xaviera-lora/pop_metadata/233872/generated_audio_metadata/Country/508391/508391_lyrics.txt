In the early hours
In some darkened place
He's sitting in his bedroom
But his mind's in space
Looking at his red board
Picking at his strings
And all the world around him
It don't mean a thing
Play guitar, play guitar
He don't want to dream
He just wants to play guitar
In deepest suburbia
In an unknown street
He sits there strumming
I'm tapping his feet
He like to be famous
He like to be the one
But back to reality
Hope's already gone
And play guitar
And play guitar
He don't need to dream
Just needs to play guitar
And play guitar
He don't wanna dream, just wants to play guitar
He don't wanna dream, just needs to play guitar
