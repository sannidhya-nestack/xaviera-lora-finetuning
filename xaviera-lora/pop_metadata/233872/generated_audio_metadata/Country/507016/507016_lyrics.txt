I'm kinda risky business, a flight risk
And I'll be a chance worth taking, I promise
I'm yours for the taking
I'm not a fool for waiting
So take it slow now
I don't know how
You know me it's all or nothing
And play your cards right
You'll be with me tonight
Don't you doubt it
Hey boy, don't you worry
I'll teach you how to love a woman
And lay your cards right
I want you here tonight
I'm all or nothing
There's no point in resisting, you know it
Put your card on the table, show it
And what's the point in waiting?
I'm yours for the taking
So take it slow now, I don't know how
You know me, it's all or nothing
When play you cards right, and be with me tonight
Hey boy, don't you worry
I'll teach you how to love a woman
And play your cards right
I'll watch you here tonight
I'm all or nothing
Take my hand, lay me down
Give me all of you
All or nothing
Say take it slow now, I don't know how
You know me, it's all or nothing
And play your cards right, you'll be with me tonight
Hey boy, don't you worry
I'll teach you how to love a woman
Play your cards right, I want you here tonight
I'm all or nothing
All or nothing
All or nothing
I'm kinda risky business
I'll be a chance worth taking
Promise
