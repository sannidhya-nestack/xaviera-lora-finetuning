I remember et-me-nots are your favorite flower
And running barefoot on the beach, chasing waves for hours
Memories sweet used to be, think I miss you and me
You're wrong, I've moved on
For all I care, change your mind
For all I care, take back goodbye
I'm doing fine on my own
It didn't hurt to let you go
For all I care, I could care less
If you say you have regrets
Come home if you think that's best
For all I care
Summer sunset, tequila sunrise, ends a perfect day
Misty twilight, stings my eyes, I barely see your face
Stars appear, I don't wish you here, think I shed one tear
You're wrong, I've moved on
For all I care, change your mind
For all I care, take back goodbye
I'm doing fine on my own
It didn't hurt to let you go
For all I care, I could care less
If you say you have regrets
Come home if you think that's best
For all I care
If we never dance again I wish you well
That's what I keep telling myself
For all I care change your mind
For all I care take back goodbye
I'm doing fine on my own
It didn't hurt to let you go
For all I care I could care less
If you say you have regrets
Come home if you think that's best
For all I care
I remember et-me-nots are your favorite flower
