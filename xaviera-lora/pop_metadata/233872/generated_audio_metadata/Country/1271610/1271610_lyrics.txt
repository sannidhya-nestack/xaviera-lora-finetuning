You came to me when I was down
Took me high above the ground
Shared laughter, thoughts and love beyond compare
You taught me how to love again
Showed me sun through all the rain
That you'd found in me your soul made life's pure air
I let you know my inner self
Gave you all my inner world
You stood with only me, you felt at peace
You saw deep inside my soul
All your promises were gold
I hoped one day I might wear your ring
But the choice you made today
Let it fade and slip away
Now all I've left to do for you is sing
So all I ask of you
Before you hurt another too
Don't let hold out for a love you cannot bring
I could have shown you what you're worth
Taken you beyond this earth
Now all I've left to do for you is sing
You saw deep inside my soul
Your promises were gold
I hoped one day I might wear your ring
But the choice you made today
Let it fade and slip away
Now all that I can do for you is sing
Yeah, it's so deep inside my soul
All your promises will go
I hoped one day I might wear your ring
But the choice you made today
Let it fade and slip away
Now all that I can do for you is sing
All I'd love to do for you is sing
