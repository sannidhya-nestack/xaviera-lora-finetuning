Everybody says I'm smart
Someday I'll leave my mark
And with a break or two I'll go far
I know I could be anything from A to Z
But I'll never be a lawyer
I can't pass the bar
I'll never be a lawyer
I can't pass the bar
Her memory drives me in
And I have failed again
I wish they'd lock up all those swinging doors
No, I'll never be a lawyer
I can't pass the bar
Smarter people than I am
Have failed a bar exam
I just don't know where all the answers are
Even at my best
Lord it's hard to pass the test
No I'll never be a lawyer
Cause I can't pass the bar
I'll never be a lawyer
Cause I can't pass the bar
Her memory drives me in
And I have failed again
I wish they'd lock up all those swinging doors
No, I'll never be a lawyer
I can't pass the bar
No, I'll never be a lawyer
I can't pass the bar
