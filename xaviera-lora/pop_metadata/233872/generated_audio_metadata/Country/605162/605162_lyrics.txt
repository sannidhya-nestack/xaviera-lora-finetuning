Well I love me some honky tonk living
I love some fast fast winning
There ain't no need to slow me down
I just have another round
I love some honky tonk living
Well the preacher preached you're going to hell
Said no I'm going back I'm here on bail
The devil hung me to you
So you could feel better about yourself
I love me some honky tonk living
I love some fast fast women
Ain't no need to slow me down
Might just have another round
I love some honky tonk living
See I've been fighting these demons all my life
They scoreboard me all the time
I just came back from hell and I'll be run
See you're pouring me a shot you better pour more than one
Well I love me some honky tonk living
I love some fast fast women
Ain't no need to slow me down
Might just have another round
I love some honky tonk living
Ain't no need to slow me down
Might just have another round
I love some honky tonk living
I love some honky tonk living
I love some honky tonk living
