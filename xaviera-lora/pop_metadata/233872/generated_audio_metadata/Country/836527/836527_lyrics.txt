Every time I turn around I'm in a route of love
Seems like I'm either falling or picking myself up
If this keeps on I'll be gone where I can rest in peace
Too much love or not enough's gonna be the death of me
If the fall don't kill me, the sudden stop will
I'll end up in a pine box, pushing up daffodils
Burnt by the heat of passion, nearly frozen by the chill
If the fall don't kill me, the sudden stop will
Love lifted me above the clouds then dropped me like a rock
Well I'm on an elevator that don't know where to stop
I've tossed and turned they can't hurt in or out of love the same
Win or lose what can I do I'm a goner either way
If the fall don't kill me the sudden stop will
I'll end up in a pine box pushing up daffodils
Burned by the heat of passion nearly frozen by the chill
If the fall don't kill me the sudden stop will
Burned by the heat of passion
Nearly frozen by the chill
If the fall don't kill me
The sudden stop will
If the fall don't kill me
If the fall don't kill me
If the fall don't kill me
