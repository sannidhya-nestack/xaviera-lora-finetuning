He's a muscle bound man, drop dead eous too
He's got a real slow hand, didn't graduate from high school
I'm doing my fishing in the shallow end of the dream pool
He's got bleached blonde hair and crazy eyes of blue
He's got a sexy smile I swear but when it comes to love he's a fool
I'm doing my fishing in the shallow end of the dream pool
I'm fishing in the bottom of a wishing well
Honey, I don't need to look in the brook
I reel'em in left and right, throw'em back every night
Baby, I wrote the book on bait and hook
I'm fishing in the bottom of a wishing well
Honey, I don't need to look in the brook
I reel'em in left and right
Throw'em back every night
Baby, I wrote the book on bait and luck
Well, I've been burned before
By sensitive, complicated men
And the only thing I'm looking for
Is a hunk with the perfect tan
That's why I'm doing my fishing
In the shallow end of the drain pool
I'm doing my fishing in the shallow end of the drain pool
I'm doing my fishing in the shallow end of the gene pool
