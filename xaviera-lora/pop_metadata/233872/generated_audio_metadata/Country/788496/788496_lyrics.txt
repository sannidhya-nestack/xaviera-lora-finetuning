Your daddy left when you were only seven
You never even got to say goodbye
Every night you pray to God in heaven
Dear Jesus why oh why
But honey that's the man I'll never be
Your precious gift God has given me
Let me dry your eyes so you can see
Honey that's the man I'll never be
Your first love gave you such attention
He had you dreaming of a better life
Somehow he ot to mention
He already had two kids and a wife
But honey that's the man I'll never be
You're a precious gift God has given me
Let me dry your eyes so you can see
Honey, that's the man I'll never be
Give me one chance, I ain't faking
I am a risk worth taking
Every man you ever loved has ditched you
Every man you loved made you cry
You're too scared to love but I wish you
Would at least give it one more try
Cause honey that's the man I'll never be
You're a precious gift God has given me
Let me dry your eyes so you can see
Honey, that's the man I'll never be
Honey, that's the man I'll never be
