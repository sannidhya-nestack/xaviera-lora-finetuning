I drove by your place tonight
Looking to find a light on
Hoping little had changed
I took the same route that we took after school
Every day since first grade
And there's your old place, just like I remember
The smell of fresh cut grass in early September
We couldn't wait to grow up and do things that big girls did
Dress up to sparkle and shine
Soon you became a woman and I got my first kiss
And we learned that love hurts sometimes
And there's your window just like an old friend
A welcome light on and I am again just right
For a moment in time
In a world that's changing fast
Seems like when our life is in pieces
Home's a good place to land
Tell me dreams stay just where you leave them
And the air is sweet tonight
I've travelled so far to wind up where I started
Where everything's just right
I couldn't wait to leave here
You couldn't wait to stay
But fate had plans of its own
Your marriage beat the odds
Mine ran out of time
And God I felt so alone
But when I look into the eyes of my children
I see the hoping for a life that can be just right
For a moment in time
In a world that's changing fast
Seems like when our life is in pieces
Home's a good place to land
Tell me dreams, stay just where you leave them
And the air is sweet tonight
I've traveled so far
To wind up where I started
Where everything's just right
I've got so much to tell you how I feel
And what it means to me to know this was real
And here you are again, my best friend
And the world is still just right
For a moment in time
In a world that's changing fast
Seems like when our life is in pieces
Home's a good place to land
Tell me dreams stay just where you live there
And the air is sweet tonight
I've traveled so far
To wind up where I started
Where everything's just right
Everything's just right
