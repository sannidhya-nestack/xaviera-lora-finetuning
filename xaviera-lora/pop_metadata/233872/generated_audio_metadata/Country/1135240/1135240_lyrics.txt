I was eight the Christmas day
I flew down our stairway
See my dream come true beneath the tree
That orange Hot Wheels racing set
Had a tiny red Corvette
But it was for my brother not for me
Later on that afternoon
I hid it in my room
Dad was mad but mama kept her cool
She said girls like fast cars too
Speed ain't just for boys
There's something'bout the sound
Of turbo engine noise
We love the look and feel
Of polished chrome and steel
But muscle is what makes the ladies move
Yeah girls like fast cars too
When I got my first real car
I thought I was Dale Earnhardt
Daytona ran up and down my street
Shifter mounted on the floor
Pretended three was on the door
One turn of the key and I was free
On those long hot summer nights
I'd catch guys at a light
And with a wink I peel out a sight
Saying girls like fast cars too
Speed ain't just for boys
There's something'bout the sound
Of turbo engine noise
We love the look and feel
Of polished chrome and steel
But muscle is what makes the ladies move
Yeah girls like fast cars too
So Mr. Let's Shift Gears, what else you got round here?
You can't skip the vans and SUVs
I'm looking for a brand new two door
Candy apple red hot street machine
girls like fast cars too
Speed ain't just for boys
There's something'bout the sound of turbo engine noise
We love the look and feel
Of polished chrome and steel
But muscle is what makes ladies move
Yeah, girls like fast cars
Love those fast cars
Girls like fast cars too
