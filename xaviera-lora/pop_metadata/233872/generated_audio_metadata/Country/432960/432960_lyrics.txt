We started out strangers in the night
Singing songs for the first time
Each year in something pretty different
Even though I never really understand it
A few glances caught my eye
A smile that was a little bit slight
I wonder what was on your mind
Capturing me all of the time
Sun-cold in love
Some call it love, I might call it love
It can only be, life's mystery
It can only be, life's mystery
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
La-la
Many others came and left me
But you were always there
Waiting for my next move
And I didn't think you cared
Some call it love
I might call it love
Some call it love
I might call it love
It can only be
Life's mystery
It can only be
Life's mystery
Time had passed, I did not see you
I was hollow, alone, I cried
I could not wait to get back to you
I never really understood just why
Some call it love (love)
I might call it love
Some call it love (love)
I might call it love
It can only be, life's mystery
It can only be, life's mystery
