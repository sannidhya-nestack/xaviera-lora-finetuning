Went in to hock for powerball tickets when the jackpot hit ten figures
Bought so many scratch offs, wore out three coins and cramped up all my fingers
I bought rifle tickets by the gross, never won a blasted thing
I lost karaoke contests all the time but I always thought I could sing
I never won a thing, thought I was a loser
Turns out I was wrong
I've been a winner since I met her
I won't et, I had the winning ticket all along
Got a great wife, two good kids and a house that's half paid off
More close friends than I deserve
For any man that should be enough
There's a shiny red truck I can drive around
Oh but she's got style
I had the winning ticket all along
And that just makes me smile
Got a couple of world class dogs and a lazy cat
Thinkin' life don't get much better than that
Used to hit the casino when I felt lucky
I ot that the house always wins
I'd go to church every Sunday and beg iveness for all my gambling sins
Went to the race track, read the tip sheets
Usually bet on the horse who ran last
Dropped a bundle on football, no luck at all
Made my money disappear so fast
I never won a thing, thought I was a loser
Turns out I was wrong
I've been a winner since I met her
I won't et, I had the winning ticket all along
Got a great wife, two good kids
And a house that's half paid off
More close friends than I deserve
For any man that should be enough
There's a shiny red truck I can drive around
Oh, but she's got style
I had the winning ticket all along
And that just makes me smile
That just makes me smile
That just makes me smile
