She said, "Daddy, what's heaven?"
Right out of the blue
In the middle of crayons and paper and glue
In the words of a child not yet seven years old
Came a question that shook me
To my very soul
But her eyes kept on asking
As a child only can
But how could I put it
And words she'd understand
So I told her I didn't know just what I believed
But if I could choose heaven this is what it would be
It's where a big magic dragon lives by the sea
As a fool who climbs his old honey tree
Where puppies and ponies run free all the day
And dreams last forever where the unicorns play
It's been so many years now since she went away
But her memory still visits
A little each day
And so for her sake and mine now
I've got to believe
That there is a heaven
And she's waiting for me
Where a big magic dragon
Lives by the sea
When he in a pool climbs his old honey tree
Where puppies and ponies run free all the day
And dreams last forever where the unicorns play
You know dreams last forever
Where the unicorns play
