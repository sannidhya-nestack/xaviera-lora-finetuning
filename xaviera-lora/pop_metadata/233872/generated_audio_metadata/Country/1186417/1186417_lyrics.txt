Pictures worth a thousand words
Stories are told, pages turn
They make me laugh, they make me cry
They reach my soul and they touch my life
All the laughter, love and scars
That's what makes us who we are
Time moves on, years go by
But somewhere in my mind
Old guitars, folded flags, grandma's voice, amazing grace
Time will never erase the beautiful marks they made (beautiful marks they made)
My first dance, my first car, my first kiss that night lit a spark
It doesn't matter who you are
Make a memory, share a moment, touch a heart
Be sure to leave a mark
We painted a cross on my grandpa's barn
We all give thanks and we all work hard
Bring on the wind, bring on the rain
It won't wash the past away
Old guitars, folded flags
Grandma's voice, amazing grace
Time will never erase
The beautiful marks they made
My first dance, my first car
My first kiss that night lit a spark
It doesn't matter who you are
Make a memory, share a moment, touch a heart
Be sure to leave a mark
We are only blessed with so much time upon this earth
Old guitars, folded flags, grandma's voice, amazing grace
Time will never erase the beautiful marks they made
My first dance, my first car, my first kiss that night lit a spark
It doesn't matter who you are
Make a memory, share a moment, touch a heart
Leave a mark
Leave a mark
