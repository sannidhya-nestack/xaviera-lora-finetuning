Whatever happened to those good old days
Cruisin' downtown in a Chevrolet's
Crew cuts and Bobby socks were in
We liked I guess times were simpler then
We got the wolfman on radio
With little Frankie Lyman and Fats Domino
Snappin' our fingers to the doo-wop-wop-bat
A little bit of sha-la-la-la
We sing shama lama shama lama ding dong
Shama lama shama lama ding dong
Shama lama shama lama ding dong
We shama lama shama lama ding dong
Oh let's bring back those golden oldie days
Do you remember that hip parade?
The Sullivan show and daddy's Burma shave?
Sock up and we would dance in the aisles
With poodle skirts, t-shirts, and pepsod and smiles
Parked by the lake'neath a lover's moon
Midnight curfew always came too soon
Who can et all the good times shared
Let's take a stroll down memory lane
We sing shama lama shama lama ding dong
Shama lama shama lama ding dong
Shama lama shama lama ding dong
Wee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee
Shama-lama, shama-lama, ding-dong
Paul, let's bring back those golden oldie days
That was a special place and time
It always takes me back when they sing "He's so fine"
Shama-lama, shama-lama, ding-dong
Shama-lama, shama-lama, ding-dong
Shama-lama, shama-lama, ding-dong
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Shama-lama shama-lama ding-dong
Shama-lama shama-lama ding-dong
Shama-lama shama-lama ding-dong
Let's bring back those golden oldie days
Oh let's bring back those golden oldie days
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
