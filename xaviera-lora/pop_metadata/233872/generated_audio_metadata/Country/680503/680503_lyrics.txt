There's a light
Far out on the sea
And there's a sign
On top of a hill
And there's a road
And it starts right here
And here I see our love
And I know it won't disappear
'Cause you and I
We've seen this before
And all this time
We've been looking for more
But instead of running
Let's sit on the sand
And instead of talking
Let's listen and dance and instead of waiting
Let's call all our friends and instead of crying
Just kiss me again
And there's a night when I cannot sleep
And there's a day when nothing seems deep
But you and I
We know what to do side by side
We fly to the moon and instead of running
We lay down on the grass and instead of talking
We just sing and dance and instead of hiding
We share it with friends
And instead of crying
We just kiss again
And instead of running
We lay down on the grass and instead of talking
We just sing and dance and instead of hiding
We share it with friends and instead of crying
We just kiss again
