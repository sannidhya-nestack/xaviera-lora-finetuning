Two lost souls finding their way
Burning of desire
While apart counting the days
Like birds caught on wire
And those who branded them unworthy
Their words fall to a otten sea
Heaven blessed the day that they met
The love between admirers
Took a chance and started to play
To see what would transpire
And those who branded them unworthy
Their words fall to a otten sea
On the road, flowers dot the highway
The pavement burns like fire
And those two keep on making their way
A love that never tires
