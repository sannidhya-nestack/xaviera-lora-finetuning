I went home looking for the old days
Searching for some of my friends
It didn't take long but we wound up in a bar
Shooting, pulling, drinking again
Order up JD, party starts here
We used to get shots for a buck
But all we got to choose from are some boutique cocktails
Um, what the f -<|28.60|>
My countryside
What happened to my countryside?
Was there a funeral? It just died
It feels like big city
My countryside
Full of beamers and them high rises
Where'd all the magic go? Say bye bye
To my countryside
It ain't all bad, case in point
Bikini car wash and cafe
The food still sucks but the car's clean
And my antenna's back up today
I'd go hunting if I could find something that even looked like the woods
But no can do, all I see for miles are upscale neighborhoods
My countryside, what happened to my countryside?
Was there a funeral, it just died, looks like big city
My countryside
Full of beamers and them high rises
Where'd all the magic go? Say bye bye
To my countryside
I'm all for progress but mama said
Don't et where you come from
And I ain't etting
But the scenery sure has changed
Holy hell, look at the size of that buck!
Who's got a rifle? Nobody? Nobody!
OMG, you guys are institutionalized!
Hey, let's go back to that car wash!
My countryside
What happened to my countryside
Was there a funeral, it just died
It looks like big city
Woah, my countryside
Full of beamers and them high rises
Where'd all the magic ghosts say bye bye
To my countryside
Where'd all the magic go? Say bye-bye to my countryside
So long, see you later, nice to have known you, damn
