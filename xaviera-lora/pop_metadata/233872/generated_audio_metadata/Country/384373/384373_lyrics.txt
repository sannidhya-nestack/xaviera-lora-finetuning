If you're feeling down and blue
And you don't know what to do
If your lover don't love you, yeah
Have another Southern Comfort
When the road's been too long
Where you're going seems too far
Find yourself a cozy bar
Yeah, have another sob in comfort
It's a sweet and sticky brew
Drink it down, it'll stick to you
Melt your brain down to a dew, yeah
Have enough southern comfort
Wash it down with Corona sun
Miller Lite or a honey can
It's a breakfast of champions, yeah
Have another Southern Comfort
It's a sweet and sticky brew
Drink it down, it'll stick to you
Melt your brain down to a goo, yeah
Have another Southern Comfort
Have another Southern Comfort
Have another Southern Comfort
