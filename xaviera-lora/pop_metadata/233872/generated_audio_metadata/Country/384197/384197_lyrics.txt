Players dream of playing
Children dream of toys
Mothers dream of babies
Girls they dream of boys
Cowboys dream of horses
Wise men dream of truth
And me I've got a simple dream
I only dream of you
Teachers dream of teaching
Lovers dream of love
Pilots dream of flying in the wild blue sky above
Bankers dream of money and hipsters dream of cool
But as long as I remember I only dream of you
I've always been a dreamer and it's taken me this far
If I decide to shoot the moon I might fall among the stars
I've always been a dreamer and they say that dreams come true
So I'll just keep on dreaming, dreaming up with you
Musicians dream of music
Kings they dream of queens
Shakespeare dreamt of writing
To be or not to be
Bachelors dream of bachelorettes
Brides they dream of grooms
But as long as I remember
I only dream of you
I've always been a dreamer and it's taken me this far
If I decide to shoot the moon and I fall among the stars
I've always been a dreamer they say that dreams come true
So I'll just keep on dreaming, dreaming I'm with you
I'll just keep on dreaming, dreaming I'm with you
