I've always been a patient kind of guy
Good things come to those who wait
Like the way my mama used to tell me, son
Slow and steady wins the race
Imagine how this took me by surprise
The moment that I realized
I believe in love at first sight
Since I first laid eyes on you
And every night I pray
Someday you might start to believe in it too
And see what I see (I see)
Every time I see you
I went out and I bought the book of love
Just to help me understand
The way you always take my breath away
Every time I hold your hand
And in those pages I know there's a clue
That tells me how I can say to you
I believe in love at first sight
Since I first laid eyes on you
And every night I pray someday you might
Start to believe in it too
And see what I see (I see)
Every time I see you
And when I'm alone
I still feel you next to me (Next to me)
The way the book said love would be (love would be)
All because I believe in love at first sight
Since I first laid eyes on you
And every night I pray someday you might
Start to believe in it too
And see what I see
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
