Looking back it seems so strange
The day we met my whole life changed
I never thought I'd ever know
What it was to love you so
When you are all I need it's true
You're why I breathe when you
Hold me in your arms
I'm inside out, I'm upside down
You turn my world around and around
I'm inside out, I'm upside down
I was lost but now I'm found
When we're close I can't let go
You'll never know how much I love you so
Within my heart it feels so fine
Knowing how your love is mine and you
Are all I need it's true
You're why I breathe when you
Hold me in your arms
I'm inside out, I'm upside down
You turn my world around and around
I'm inside out, I'm upside down
I was lost but now I'm found
And you are all I need, it's true
You're why I breathe when you hold me in your arms
I'm inside out, I'm upside down
You turn my world around and around
I'm inside out, I'm upside down
I was lost, but now I'm found
I'm inside out, I'm upside down
You turn my world around and around
I'm inside out, I'm upside down
I was lost but now I'm found
I'm inside out, I'm upside down
You turn my world around and around
I'm inside out, I'm upside down
I was lost but now I'm found
Found
