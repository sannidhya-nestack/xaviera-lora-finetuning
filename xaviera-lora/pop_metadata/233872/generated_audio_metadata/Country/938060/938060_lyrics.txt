I saw her groovin' down Main Street (there she goes)
Head to cheek, she looked familiar to me (you're goin' my way, baby)
Just like a movie star from a Hollywood scene, mm
She's just the kinda girl that I'd like to meet
She's so fine, she's alright
My honey, my baby, yeah (Chillin' by the seaside, oh yeah)
Like a wise guy, wanna take a ride with me (Oh, I got you on my mind)
All the time, yeah (My honey, my baby, yeah)
Keep doing some good time, wanna go on goodbye, do the two step with me
A rolled up sleeping bag, a thumb in the air
Soft scent of strawberries and her wavy blonde hair (you're going my way baby)
That top white lace top and them cut off jeans
I should have seen it there, she was way out of my league, she's so fine
She's alright, yeah, my honey, honey, yeah (And then I wish I got just a little tongue-tied with you so close to me)
Boy, I got you on my mind all the time, yeah, my honey, honey (And getting honey on that tongue-tied, you didn't tell the drive one of all the times on me)
Ooh, I just need some time with you (Just a little time, baby)
A table set for two (pussy, this is the way that we do now)
Just a little bit of me and you, yeah
My honey, honey, yeah, uh (shake, shake it in the booth)
Come on, shake, shake your little boom-bam-boom
Come on, shake, shake your little boom-boom
Shake, shake your little boom-bam-boom
Yeah, there's a time to talk tough and a time to love one another
Never judge a book by how it's been written on its cover
Treat every lady you meet like you like others to treat your mother never
Confuse the love of your true love and favorite lover
Hot as my dime in Rio after hauling all day
All the cowboys at the Flying J wanna know her name
(You're going my way, baby)
Wild as a Mustang from Soho she came
But these blue eyes of mine are gonna take her breath away
She's so fine
She's all mine, yeah, my honey, honey, yeah (Make it honey out of moonshine, shake that little beehive, get your buzz on with me)
Ooh, I got you on my mind all the time, my honey, honey, yeah (If you're looking for a good time, a little after midnight, wanna get wild with me?)
Ooh, I just need some time with you (Just a little time, baby)
A table set for two (Cause that's the way that we do now)
Just a little bit of
Me and you, my honey Sunday, yeah (Shake, shake, you little boom, boom)
Shake, shake, you little boom, bam, boom (My honey Sunday, yeah)
Shake, shake, you little boom, bam, boom (I wanna make you mine, oh mine)
Shake, shake, you little boom, bam, boom (I wanna make you mine, oh mine)
Shake, shake, you little boom, bam, Boom (Oh my honey Sunday)
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (my honey, honey, yeah)
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, boom, boom, boom (hey, gonna make you mine, oh mine)
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, boom, boom (yeah, gonna make you mine, oh mine)
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, boom, boom (we were sippin' on some moonshine)
Dancing by the lakeside
Kicking with my baby and me
Cruisin' in the moonlight, blowin' through the stop signs
Drop it down and it will dry
My honey, honey, yeah
Oh my honey, honey, yeah
Mm, my honey, honey, yeah
