Ditching me for disc golf on a Saturday afternoon
While I'm wasting time wondering why I can't come to
Hanging on to my phone instead of hanging out with my friends
You get toasted, I get ghosted, and it keeps on happening
But I'm better than that, better than that, better than maybe we'll meet up later
Better than that, better than that, better than handing my heart to a breaker
Better than all the times you don't take the time to call me back
I'm better than that
Better than that, better than all that
I'm better than that
Too broke to take me out
But you got the cash for cigarettes
And beer and bunions and all that stupid shhh
You say you'll come over at seven
You roll up 8 .45
Now I ain't gonna be waiting on you next time
'Cause I'm better than that, better than that, better than maybe we'll meet up later
Better than that, better than that, better than handin' my heart to a breaker
Better than all the times you don't take the time to call me back
I'm better than that, better than that, better than all that
I'm better than nights, hey, hey, hey
I'm better than nights
Alright, here's the truth, y'all ready?
I don't even get a drunk text
You show up when you want sex
I need more, more but you're less
And I wish you were better than that, better than that
Better than me but we'll meet up later
Better than that, better than that
Better than a waste my life heartbreaker
Better than all the times you don't take the time to call me back
I'm better than that, better than that, better than all that
I'm better than that, yeah, I'm better than that
