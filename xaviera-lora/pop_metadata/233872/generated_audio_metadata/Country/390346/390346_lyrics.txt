I want to be like everyone, everyone
You want to be like me
I want to be like everyone, everyone
You want to be like me
I'm just a colleague spinning in a big machine
I'm just a spy but wish I had better genes
I want to be like Jesus Christ
It would be nice to save you from your sins
I want to be on the movie screen
The new James Dean, make out with all the babes
But I'm just a guy that's spinning in a big machine
I'm just a sly but wish I had better genes
It's okay to be who you are now
You don't have to be a superstar
Just be yourself and go and verify
It's okay to be who you are
I want to be like Michelangelo
Paint naked ladies all day
I want to play in the Super Bowl
Catch a throw that wins the big game
But I miss the cars spinning in the big machine
I miss the style but I wish I had better jeans
I wanna be like everyone, everyone
You wanna be like me
I wanna be like everyone, everyone
You wanna be like me
I wanna be like everyone, everyone
You wanna be like me
I want to be like everyone, everyone
You want to be like me
I'm just a college student in the big machine
I'm just a sliver, wish I had better genes
I'm just a college student in the big machine
I'm just like I wish I had better genes
