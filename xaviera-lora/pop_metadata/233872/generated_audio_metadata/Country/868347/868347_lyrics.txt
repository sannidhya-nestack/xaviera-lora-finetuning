I'm gonna have some fun tonight
I'm gonna drink some cold-boiled light
And I got a cooler full enough
So come and get your sum, come and get your sum
There's music in the air
There's a party everywhere
And I got winning on my mind
And the girls are looking fine
And I'll be making some noise
Me and the boys will be having some fun
And the day is done in an F1
Fifty, pick up truck, line'em up, line'em up, line'em up
Game on
We can play all night long
We can take it all away
Game on
We can play our favorite song
We can play it fast, play it slow, play it on the radio
Come and get your game, come and get your game on
Come and get your game, come and get your game on
It's time to celebrate
There's a party on the way
Yeah it's time to have some fun
So come and get your some
Come and get your some
Take'em down at home
We can take'em on the road
We'll be living it up
Living it up for that 13 and 0
Start to cheer with some cold cold beer
There's a whiskey river in the atmosphere
With a lucky koozie and a dixie cup
I raise'em up, raise'em up, raise'em up
Game on
We can play all night long
We can take it all
Game on, we can play our favorite song, we can play it fast, play it slow, play it on the radio
Come and get your game, come and get your game on
Come and get your game, come and get your game on
Touchdown, throwin' around
The boys are loud and the girls go wild
Half time, big bright lights
Fill my cup for some fun tonight
And I start to cheer with some cold cold beer
There's a whiskey river in the atmosphere
With my lucky koozie and a dixie cup
I raise'em up, raise'em up, raise'em up
Game on
We can play it all night long
We can take it all
Come and get your game, come and get your game on
We can play a favorite song
We can play fast, play it slow, play it on the radio
Come and get your game, come and get your game on
Come and get your game, come and get your game on
Come and get your game, come and get your game on
Come and get your game, come and get your game on
Game on
