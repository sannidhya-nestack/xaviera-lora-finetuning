When I woke up this morning the sun was in my face
And on my clock radio they played Amazing Grace
I stumbled to the bathroom and I sprinted for my car
And I sped down that freeway just like a shooting star
It was a great day for a day dream
But I didn't have time, no I didn't have time
It was a great day for an ice cream
But I did not have the time
It was a great day for a silly wish
But I didn't have time, no I didn't have time
It was a great day for the perfect kiss
But I did not have the time
I got to work this morning, and there were papers on my desk
And my office looked a lot like me, that's to say it was a mess
I darted for my coffee and I downed it like a pill
And I dashed to beat that deadline with no time to kill
It was a great day for a day dream
But I didn't have time, no I didn't have time
It was a great day for an ice cream
But I did not have the time
It was a great day for a silly wish
But I didn't have time, no I didn’t have time
It was a great day for the perfect kiss
But I did not have the time
When I got home this evening, the moon was sinking low
And I wondered where the day had gone and what I had to show
For all the working hours, for time away from home
When I wake up tomorrow, I'm gonna make that day my own
It was a great day for a daydream, but I didn't have time, no, I didn't have time
It was a great day for an ice cream, but I did not have the time
It was a great day for a silly wish
But I didn't have time, no I didn't have time
It was a great day for the perfect kiss
But I did not have the time
No I could not find the time
Well I would not make the time
