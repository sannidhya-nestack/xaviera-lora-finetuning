It's a beautiful day and I'm riding'round
Got the top down and the radio's playing Keith Urban
And the wind's blowing through my hair
Hey, I don't care if my heart is broken
I love the feeling of the open road
I'm getting better every mile I go
And hey, what a day to shake a heartache
And I, I think it's time I found my way
Back to who I was before
Found my baby, that's for sure
And hey, what a day to shake a heartache
Not a cloud up there in the summer sky
And I wonder why
I waited so many lonely nights just crying
Getting over you, I'm so overdue
Hey enough already
My heart is lighter and it's all so clear
It feels so good just getting out of here
And hey, what a day to shake a heartache
And I think it's time I find my way
Back to who I was before
Bye bye baby that's for sure
And hey, what a day to shake a heartache
Hey!
I love the feeling of the open road
I'm getting better every mile I go
Hey, quite a day to shake a heartache
And I think it's time I find my way
And hey, what a day to shake a heartache
And I think it's time I find my way back to who I was before
Bye-bye baby, that's for sure
And hey, what a day to shake a heartache
