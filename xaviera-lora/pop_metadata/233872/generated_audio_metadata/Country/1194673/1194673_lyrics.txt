The shade I feel is a different hue
But here's the deal, it's still about you
It may seem lame to follow some rule
But hey, my aim is to get somewhere cool
When last call's done
Like I'm in that sun
I close my eyes but I'm seeing you for the first time
Color me Deja Blue
Color me Deja Blue
We both work hard, but when the game starts
You show your card, the seven of hearts
You move so fast, stay in one place
You're here at last, my saving grace
It's not the end
I'm still your friend
We'll meet again'til then
Paint me in your Garden of Eden
And color me Deja Blue
Color me Deja Blue
I'll give you a spoiler alert
So you can see
Though it's true you got hurt
You're still living in my heart rent free
Colour me, colour me, colour me, colour me, colour me (colour me, colour me, colour me, colour me, colour me, colour me)
Color me, color me, Deja Blue, Deja Blue, Deja Blue
