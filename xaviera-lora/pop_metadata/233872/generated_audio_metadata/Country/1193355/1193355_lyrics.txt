Girl, I'm so in the mood
Here under a lover's moon
To make sweet love to you
To celebrate with you
The day we got married
Our anniversary
So throw that blanket down
There's no one else around
Oh, I can't believe I found a girl who sold my whole world
Baby, I got you, that's all I need
Baby, I got you, got you loving me
Holding, kissing you
I'm sure loving the view
Of my dream girl in my arms
This falling more ain't hard
Your charm blows me away
Like it did from that first day
And I love your loving heart
In everything you are
Sugar ever since our first embrace
I'm not lacking for anything
Baby I got you
That's all I need
Baby I got you
Got you loving me
Baby when I found you, I found such grace
I'll never leave you, there's no way
Baby I got you, that's all I need
Baby I got you, got you loving me
With you so blessin' me
With you so blessin' me
Love you so blessin' me
Girl
Baby I got you (with you so blessin' me)
With you so blessin' me (that's all I need)
Love you so blessin' me (girl)
Baby I got you (with you so blessin' me)
With you so blessin' me (got you lovin' me)
Love you so blessin' me
Girl, baby I got you (so blessed in me)
Baby, so blessed in me (that's all I need)
Love is so blessed in me
Girl, baby I got you (so blessed in me)
Baby, so blessed in me (God you're loving me)
Love is so blessed in me
Girl, baby, I got you
You're so blessed to me, baby, you're so blessed to me
That's all I need
Girl, you're so blessed to me
Girl, that's all I need
