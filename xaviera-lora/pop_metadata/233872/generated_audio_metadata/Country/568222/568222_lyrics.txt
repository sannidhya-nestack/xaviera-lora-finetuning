And if I fell in love with you
I'd bite your lips, I'd bite your toes
I'd just make sure to catch our time
Before the fruit could change its taste
Sometimes I wonder, wonder why
I am so tired of being alive
When you are eager for everything
I look around now and I have to say
It's beautiful, yeah it's beautiful
Far from springtime, flowers bloom
It doesn't mean that I'm in love
What the hell, I pulled your leg
But it's the sweetest lie I've ever said
You're beautiful
Girl, you're beautiful
It's beautiful
You're beautiful
It's beautiful
You're beautiful
