Well you know I've seen a lot of things all throughout the years
I see my share of trouble and shed my share of tears
See myself make some bad mistakes then I'd have to see them through
But of all the things I've ever seen
I don't know what I ever saw in you
Well you know I've seen one million things
In this crazy mixed up world
Seen a lot of pretty women
And lots of lovely girls
But beauty's only skinny
And now I know that's true
Cause of all the things I've ever seen
I don't know what I ever saw in you
Well I shoulda seen it coming
But they say that love is blind
Well I finally got my vision back
So I'm leaving you behind
Behind the signs of 2020
And I'm glad that we are through
of all the things I've ever seen
I don't know what I ever saw in you
Well, you know I've seen a lot of things that I never would have planned
Seen my share of romance and lots of one-night stands
Seen lots of situations where I did not know what to do
But of all the things I've ever seen, I don't know what ever saw in you
Well, I should have seen it coming, but they say that love is blind
I finally got my vision back, so I'm leaving you behind
My hindsight's 20 /20, and I'm glad that we all through
of all the things I've ever seen, I don't know what I ever saw in you
