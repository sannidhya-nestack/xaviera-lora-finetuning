Well all the leaves are falling
The wind's calling my name
And all the birds yell, "fall in line"
I get this feeling every time it rolls around
It says, "Son, you better follow that butterfly"
I'll see you next time
The season starts to change
For I must be moving on
I feel my heart pounding
My blood it's on the run
And I can't seem to stop the flow, no, no, no
Might I remind you my friend it's nothing that you've done
I've been this way all of my life
And though I'll miss you when you pass through my mind
I'm sure you know I'll never change
I'll see you next time the season starts to change
For I must be moving on
I feel my heart pounding my blood it's on the run
And I can't seem to stop the flow
No, no, no
I can't seem to stop it
I can't seem to stop the flow
No, no, no
