It's gonna be a train wreck or it's gonna be a good call
Will it be alright?
A thousand times I have dreamt about this day
The tension does it show
The thought of letting go, oh-oh-oh
Another risk, it's a gamble I must take
To make it all complete
And bring you back to me, come on
It's gonna be a train wreck
Or it's gonna be a close call
Either way I'm excited
It's gonna be a short bet, that we're headed for a big fall
Everything is guided
Will the stars come out tonight? Is there love coming outside?
It's gonna be a train wreck, or it's gonna be a good call
Will it be alright?
Adrenaline keeps on pumping through my veins
The time is getting close
Anticipation flows, oh oh oh
I close my eyes
We're connected once again
And now you're texting me
I'm back on the social feed (come on)
It's gonna be a train wreck
Or it's gonna be a close call
Either way I'm excited
It's gonna be a short bet
That we're headed for a big fall
Everything is guided
Will the stars come out tonight?
Is there love on our side?
It's gonna be a train wreck
Or is it gonna be a good call?
Will it be alright?
It's gonna be alright
Yeah, yeah, oh
Will the stars come out tonight? (Will the stars come out tonight?)
Is there love out there in our sight? (Is there love?)
It's gonna be a train wreck
Or it's gonna be a close call
Will it be alright?
It's gonna be a train wreck
Or it's gonna be a good call
Will it turn out right? (It's gonna be alright)
