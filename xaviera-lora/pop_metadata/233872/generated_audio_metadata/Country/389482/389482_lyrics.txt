It's really such a pity you don't want me anymore
I never thought that it would end this way
I guess I wasn't listening all those times you slammed the door
Just closed my eyes and drank the pain away
You told me I'm the guy who swore to God the blues and I were through
Must have swore a thousand times the promises were true
Good whiskey turns a nightish man to liar
The bottle left me dangling on the wire
The bottle left me dangling, dangling over fire
You were always looking up to me
You thought I was a king
But you came to finally realize
My golden crown was nothing
But a painted piece of tin
I'm not the man I once was in your eyes
You told me I'm the guy who swore to God
The booze and I were through
Must have swore a thousand times the promises were true
Good whiskey turns an honest man to liar
The bottle left me dangling on the wire
The bottle left me dangling
Dangling over fire
You really wanted the kind of love I could not get
I teased you with a touch, you took the bait
Like some wise old fisherman trapped you in my net
Now for you iving is too late
You told me I'm the guy who swore to God the booze and I were through
Must have swore a thousand times the promises were true
Good whiskey turns an honest man to liar
The bottle left me dangling on the wire
The bottle left me dangling
Dangling over fire
Dangling over fire
Dangling over fire
