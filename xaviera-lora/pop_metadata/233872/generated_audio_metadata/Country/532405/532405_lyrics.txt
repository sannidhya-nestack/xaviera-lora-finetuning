I saw you when you saw him coming through the door
And I knew I'd never seen that look before
The light in your eyes everybody could see
But what I saw was you leaving me
I couldn't help but notice how he made you smile
You haven't been that thrilled in a long, long while
I know I don't own you and that's not how it should be
But it's happening way too fast, you're leaving me
Well they say when you love somebody
It's best to let'em fly
And honey I love you so I could cry
Seeing you this happy
Knowing it's how you want it to be
Makes it all come out okay
You believe in me
You won't hear what I hear when you say I do
All the sounds of mixed emotions I'm going through
There's my little girl, the one who sat on my knee
Blue jeans, pigtails, now she's leaving me
Well they say when you love somebody
It's best to let'em fly
And honey I love you so I'm gonna cry
Seeing you this happy knowing it's how you want it to be
Makes it all come out okay, you believe in me
Well I have to say I was scared of this day
Walking you down that aisle to another man
But the closer we both get, I let go with every step
Then he steps up and smiles, and you reach out for his hand
Well they say when you love somebody, it's best to let'em fly
And honey I love you so, couldn't help but cry
Seeing you this happy, knowing it's how you want it to be
Makes it all come out okay, you leaving me
Yeah, it all came out okay, you leaving me
