Well some die hoping but you still thought you'd get
A fair day's pay for all your trouble and sweat
Add in a slow-mo replay, placebo your years away
Maybe live'em all out like in some morality play
But you know how it is
'Cause it happened all the time
Life was never very kind
Hey look, don't you waste my time
There is a small possibility that good things can be found
With your head in the clouds and your two flat feet off the ground
You wear a sad-eyed suicide, sobbing like Johnny Ray
Like the means to the end could be justified that way
But you know how it is
it happens all the time
Life was never very kind
Hey look, don't you waste my time
Well, some die hoping but you still thought you'd get
A third A's pay for all your trouble and sweat
And in the slow-mo replay, classy for your years away
Maybe live them all out like in some morality play
But you know how it is
'Cause it happens all the time
Life was never very kind
Look, don't you waste my time
