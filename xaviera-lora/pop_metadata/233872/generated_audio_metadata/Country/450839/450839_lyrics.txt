I got me one of those GPS's so I wouldn't get lost
No second guesses, it's right on time with great instructions
But it totally missed all that road construction
Recalculating, I can't make this turn
Recalculating
My stomach's starting to churn, she says turn right in a hundred feet
In an accented voice she again repeats, recalculating, recalculating
Confused and lost one stormy night
When that unit froze up searching satellites
Asked some old slick why his help would cost
He grinned and said, "Buddy boy, I ain't lost"
Recalculating, it let me down again
Recalculating, I had to throw him a ten
He said go south for about a mile
The interstate would show in a little while
Recalculating, recalculating
Gonna jerk that gizmo off my dash
Mosey down to Walmart, get back my cash
It won't be missed once it's up and gone
My wife can always tell what I'm doing wrong
Recalculating
It said to turn back there
Recalculating
My darling said turn right here
Who needs that gadget plug by my knee
Who needs another woman squawking at me
Recalculating
Recalculating
Who are
Recalculating
Recalculating
Turn right, 100 feet
Turn right
Recalculating
Recalculating
