I stay home with the kids
While you're out doing your thing
I keep them entertained
We play games, watch TV and sing
When they're tired and sleepy
I take them upstairs
Then we kneel down by the bedside
And say our prayers
The family that prays together
When you've had your fun, come home to one who cares
The family that kneels together
Can't always deal together
So get down on your knees
I'm asking you please
Answer my prayers
A lion dead awake
Until I hear you come in
You stumble by my room
On your way to the couch once again
You stop for just a moment
Is it just a tease?
If you came in, you would find me down on my knees
The family that prays together, stays together
When you've had your fun
Come home to one who cares
The family that kneels together
Can't always deal together
So get down on your knees
I'm asking you please answer my prayers
So get down on your knees
I'm asking you please answer my prayers
