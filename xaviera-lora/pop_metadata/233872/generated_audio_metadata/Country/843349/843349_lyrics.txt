Give me a down beat, that's upbeat
I want to kick up my heels tonight
Give me a down beat, that's upbeat
That'll swing the countryside
Steppin' out now, headin' downtown, feelin' upbeat
Dancing cheek to cheek still has its place
Tonight I want to swing my partner, I need a little space
So count it off, don't count on cutting in
Tonight I'm gonna cut the rug
Let's begin, give me a down beat, that's upbeat
Wanna kick up my heels tonight
Give me a down beat, that's upbeat
That'll swing the countryside
Steppin' out now, headin' downtown, feelin' upbeat
Ballroom dancing's way too square for me
Dosie does a little slow, I got fiddles in my feet
Gonna bebop till I drop, so make it hip
Take it from the top
Let it rip (1, 2, 3, 4)
Gimme a down deep, that's upbeat
Wanna kick up my heels tonight
Gimme a down deep, that's upbeat
That'll swing the countryside
Steppin' out now, headin' downtown
Gimme a down deep, that's upbeat
Want to kick up my heels tonight
And give me a down beat that's upbeat
That'll swing the countryside
Steppin' out now, headin' downtown, feelin' upbeat
Steppin' out now, headin' downtown, feelin' upbeat
Steppin' out now, headin' downtown, feelin' upbeat
