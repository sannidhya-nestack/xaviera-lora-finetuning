Light as a feather as you jump on my back
And wrap your legs around me soft and smooth
The smell of this lady just throws me off track
And I begin to act like a fool
I fumble my words as she kisses my neck
As the sun sings slow in the west
This moment I hope I remember so clear
As one of my very best
We head to the water as the day turns to night
And watch the moonlight dance on the waves
She stripped off her clothes and ran down to the water side
And said, "Hey big boy, what's the wave?"
I tripped on my clothes and then fell to the ground
And then I heard her laughter ringing out
This moment I hope I'll remember so clear
Her laugh was a sweet, sweet sound
Sunrise approaches and she's wrapped in my arms
Morning birds are singing their song
I can't believe this night has come and gone away so fast
But good things don't last for very long
But memories last for a lifetime she says
As my heart beats fast in my chest
This moment I know I'll remember so clear
As one of my very best
Memories last for a lifetime she said
As my heart beats fast in my chest
This moment I know I'll remember so clear
As one of my very best
