You dreamed me a song tonight
Composed in your heart
Shot it straight through my soul
Hit me in the dark
What is it that inspires you
Let me see inside your heart
What gives you hope in life
What sets you apart
Slingshot my love to you
Boomerang my soul
Draw me more close to you
Capture my goals
You spark imagination
Your magical guitar
It's true fascination
It's magic in a jar
You live on Desolation Road
Challenge left and right
You suffered at an early age
And yet you saw the light
Slingshot my love to you
Boomerang my soul
Draw me more close to you
Capture my goals
I'm intrigued how it came to be
How you got to where you are
Curiosity has got the best of me
How's it you're who you are
You inspire all the best in me
You bring out all that's good
You've overcome the worst in life
You're just misunderstood
Slingshot my love to you
Boomerang my soul
Draw me more close to you
Capture my gold
Slingshot my love to you
Boomerang my soul
Draw me more close to you
Capture my goals
