I saw a couple have a New Year's fight, she said
I thought that marriage was to last for life
He bowed his head, not knowing what to say
I won't et the words she said, for he walked away
Fragile rings of gold hold us together
They bend so far with give and take
Vows of love like gold should last forever
Rings of gold should not break
Me and my man have our troubles too
Midnight was falling, I was feeling blue
Lovers were kissing to auld lang syne
I whispered, "I love you"'til the end of time
And I said, "Fragile rings of gold hold us together
They'll bend so far with give and take"
Vows of love like gold should last forever
Rings of gold should not break
It's four in the morning and everybody's gone
The party's over, we're dancing all alone
My head on his shoulder, the darkness fades away
My thoughts shift back to our vows on our wedding day
Preacher said, God bless these rings of gold
Bonds of love, two hearts become one soul
Love can last forever, together you grow
If you give and learn to bend
Give and learn to bend
Like these bands of gold
Fragile rings of gold
Hold us together
They'll bend so far
With give and take
Vows of love like gold should last forever
Rings of gold should not break
Our rings of gold will not break
