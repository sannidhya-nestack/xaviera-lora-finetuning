All you know I love pickin' but the clock it is tickin'
And boys I gotta be on my way
my girlfriend Ricky she said she needs me
I love pickin' but I just can't stay
Some day when you meet her you'll know why
Had myself on the back I'm a lucky guy
I don't deserve her but love is the key
I've been thinking about getting on one knee
She came out of the darkness like a revelation
She was our bright light, thank you God
She brings me coffee and breakfast in bed
Then we get down to business, enough said
Biscuits and gravy and it's off to the gym
Gotta keep my figure, gotta stay slim
I think I'm the luckiest there's ever been
It's my vote, she's a solid ten
I could pick all night, but that would make me late
She's high voltage, her brain is solid state
She takes me places I ain't ever been
It could only get better with a twin
Rikki Tikki Tik Tok Tik Tok Rikki Tikki Tik Tok
Rikki Tikki Tik Tok Tik Tok Rikki
You know I love pickin' but the clock it is tickin'
And boys I gotta be on my way
my girlfriend Ricky
She says she needs me
And I love pickin' but I just can't stay
Now I could pick all night but that would make me late
She's high voltage her brain is solid state
She takes me places I ain't ever been
It could only get better with us
Rikki-tikki, tik-tok, tik-tok, Rikki-tikki, tik-tok, Rikki-tikki, tik tok, tik tok, ooh Rikki
