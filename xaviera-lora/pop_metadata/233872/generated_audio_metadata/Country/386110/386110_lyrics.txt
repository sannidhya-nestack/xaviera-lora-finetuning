There was a time
At Freddy's luncheonette
That's where we used to meet
The burgers, fries and all those egg creams
They were sweet, there was a time
When harmony and laughter filled the summer streets
The school yard called to come play ball to you and me
There was a time
We held the girls real tight
Teenagers searching for romance
We found friendships for a lifetime
A lifetime
There was a time
We strummed guitars and sang about Tom Dooley's plight
Played clancy tunes at local bars all through the night
There was a time
Neighborhood wide dance
We held the girls real tight
Teenagers searching for romance
We found friendships for a lifetime
A lifetime
There was a time
At Freddy's luncheonette
That's where we used to meet
