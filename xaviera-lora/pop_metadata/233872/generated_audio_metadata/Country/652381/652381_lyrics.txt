Got on board American Airlines
Flew from the Charlie Douglas International Airport
Down to New Orleans
To a waiting limousine in the Big Easy
Took the limousine driver
Handed him a fiver
Told him to drive me where they play the blues
The kind they do right here in New Orleans
Took a trip down to Bourbon Street stopping at a bar I see
Sipping on a hurricane while they play the blues
The kind they do right here in New Orleans
I can still hear them sing
Don't worry'bout tomorrow
For it will soon find you in a way
I can still hear them saying
Don't worry about tomorrow
As long as you're right here in New Orleans
I can still hear them sing
Don't worry'bout tomorrow
Red will soon find you anyway
I can still hear them sing
Don't worry'bout tomorrow
As long as you're right here in New Orleans
Going home to North Carolina
On that big old jet airliner that brought me here
Down in New Orleans
Way down in New Orleans
In the big easy
I took the limousine driver
Handed him a fiver
Told his mother fun I had like I never knew
Like they do right here in New Orleans
Like they do right here in New Orleans
Like they do right here in New Orleans
