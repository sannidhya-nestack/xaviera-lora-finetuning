Love is strong, love is sweet, love is wild and free
Love is two together in perfect harmony
Love looks ahead forever and makes the heart believe
If you have love in your life, you have everything
There's nothing like love
It's out of this world
When just the right boy
Meets just the right girl
Miracles can happen
When true lovers touch
Any heart will tell you
There's nothing like love
There's love that falls, love that flies
Love that skips a beat
Love that knows the reasons why you and I should be
Thankful for each other
Together we're complete
If we have love in our lives, darling, we have everything
There's nothing like love, it's out of this world
When just the right boy meets just the right girl
Miracles can happen when true lovers touch
Any heart will tell you there's nothing like love
And no, there's nothing like love
It's out of this world
When just the right boy meets just the right girl
And miracles can happen when true lovers touch
And any heart will tell you there's nothing like love
