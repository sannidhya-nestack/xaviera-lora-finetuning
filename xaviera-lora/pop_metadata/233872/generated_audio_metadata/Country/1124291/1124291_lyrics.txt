Sometimes a dream collides with a nightmare
And they both come true
And it feels just like your world is gonna break in two
If every turn you take leads to a path unknown
Let my love show the way, never walk alone
When your bridges are burning and the ashes rain down
And you find yourself running, praying you're never found
When you wanna ride the wind but your wings are worn
I'll be the mountain and you'll be the storm
I'll be the mountain, you'll be the storm
When the price of life is too high and the world holds you down
I will lift you up my dear to find higher ground
I'm the bright sun in your sky in the solid ground below
You can rest on my love or the peace you'll know
When your bridges are burning and the ashes rain down
And you find yourself running, praying you're never found
When you wanna ride the wind but your wings are worn
I'll be the mountain
You'll be the start
I'm the rock that you can lean on
I'm the summit you can climb
I'm forever yours and you are mine
When your bridges are burning
And the ashes rain down
When you find yourself walking
On uncommon ground
When you wanna ride the wind
But your sails are tore
Oh, you'll be the waves
And I'll be the shore
When your bridges are burning
And the ashes rain down
You find yourself running, a drain you'll never found
When you wanna ride the wind, but your wings are worn
Oh, I'll be the mountain, you'll be the storm, yeah
I'll be the mountain, you'll be the storm
Mm-hmm, yeah, you can be the storm
