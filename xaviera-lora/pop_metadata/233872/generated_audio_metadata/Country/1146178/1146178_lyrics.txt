Thanks for picking up the phone, sure glad I caught you home
How long's it been, a week or two
Long enough to figure out I'm a fool for walking out
All I really want is you
Thought I had enough of this serious relationship
And I was ready for something new
But no matter what I tried I could not be satisfied
All I really want is you
Thought I'd feel as free as a bird
But out here on my own I'm not so sure
And I admit that I was wrong to think I'm moving on
Wouldn't blame you if you said we're through
So baby please stay on the line
Let's give it one more try
All I really want is you
Thought I'd feel as free as a bird
But out here on my own I'm not so sure
So thanks for picking up the phone, just wanted you to know
I can't find no substitute for the way we used to laugh
If I know we can get it back, all I really want is you (all I really want is you)
All I really want is you
