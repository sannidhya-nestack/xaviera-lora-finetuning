Tossing and turning, trying to et the truth
I know it's coming, a minute without you
Can't see how I will get through
Don't want to wake to see that your face isn't there
But I know that me without you is better instead
So if you're leaving me, I won't stand in your way
I never did, anyway, if you're thinking
You can change, it's too late, I won't make that mistake
And those three words I won't say,'cause I won't make you stay
The colors are fading
This picture of us in my head
It's kept me waiting
I'm starting to feel that
Perfect image of us wasn't real
Though I would like to have more than this last goodbye
All that is left of us are these tears that we've cried
So if you're leaving me, I won't stand in your way
I never did, anyway, if you're thinking
You can change, it's too late, I won't make that mistake
And those three words I won't say
I won't make you stay
The last goodbye might be forever
It's not enough to hold this love together
You always said I'd never get over you
If you're leaving me, I won't stand in your way
I never did anyway, and if you're thinking
You can change, it's too late, I won't make that mistake
And those three words I won't say,'cause I won't make you stay
I won't make you stay
