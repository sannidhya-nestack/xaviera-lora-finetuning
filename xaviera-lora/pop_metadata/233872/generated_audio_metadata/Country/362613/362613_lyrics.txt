My grandma was so good to me growing up
On my birthday she made me feel like such a special kid
She would bring me purses, jewelry, another cool girl style
But there was one more thing
She always did
She brought me a red balloon
A card came with it that said
Take the balloon
Aim it to the sky
Make a wish, close your eyes
And reach real high
The heavens will take note
And give your dream life
When you're ready
Let it go
When high school graduation came, grandma wasn't feeling well
And mama said she couldn't be there
Saw her stand up proud when they called my name
And when I came off the podium and down the stairs
She handed me a red balloon, a card came with it that said
Take the balloon, aim it to the sky
Make a wish, close your eyes
And reach real high
The heavens will take note
And give your dream life
When you're ready
Let it go
Two days after this angel of a woman passed on
My four year old wrote a message in crayon
She taped it to grandma's red balloon and then
Asked if she could send it up to heaven
And I said, "Take the balloon, aim it to the sky"
Make a wish, close your eyes, and reach real high
Grandma will take note, and know you said goodbye when you're ready
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
