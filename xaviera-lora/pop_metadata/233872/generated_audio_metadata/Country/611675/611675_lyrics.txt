Tommy the cat has got nine lives
He's been shot four times and run over twice
He don't care that he's on life number seven
when he dies he's going to pussycat heaven
Tommy ain't nothing but an old alley cat
A romance in all the neighbor's pets
Some guys would die and live like that
Tommy ain't nobody's tomcat
One day Tom turned up scratching on my screen
Looking mighty pitiful, lonesome and lean
I fed him, loved him, got him back on all fours
And two days later he was out the door
Tommy ain't nothin' but an old alley cat
A romance in all the neighbor's pets
Some guys would die to live like that
Tommy ain't nobody's tomcat
Tommy don't wear no collar'round his neck
Don't answer to no one and he won't fetch
He knows how to charm the fur off a feline
Shack up and chow down and make a beeline
Tommy ain't nothing but an old alley cat
Romancing all the neighbor's pets
But some guys would die to live like that, whoa
Tommy ain't nobody's tomcat
But that's about as good as life can get
When you're living the life of Tommy the Cat
Tommy, you fence-jumping, dog-dodging acrobat
You got the run of the neighborhood
Stay around all day, get two square meals, all the pussycat chasing you can handle
Ain't nothing better than that
Tommy, you got the perfect life
