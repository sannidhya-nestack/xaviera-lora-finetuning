Oh I just spent my vacation day
Trapped on the tarmac at JFK, hey
Good times, oh good times
They sent my bags to Buffalo
Too bad I was flying to Mexico
Oh good times, good times
As a bad day got even worse I didn't yell, I didn't curse
you were always there with a funny line
There were good times if you don't mind
Fresh frustration, a heap of aggravation
With some irritation on the side
But they were good times'cause you could find
A way to laugh at each bad luck bash
When other people would have lost their cool
They were good times
They were times spent with you
Mmm with you
Spent last Sunday afternoon
Helping you shop for perfume
Good times, oh good times
Didn't look where I put my coat
Had to buy the bottles that I broke
Oh good times, good times
And though my jacket smelled like a beauty queen
I didn't holler, didn't scream
you were always there with a funny laugh
They were good times, if you don't mind
Fresh frustration, a heap of aggravation
With some irritation on the side
But they were good times,'cause you could find
A way to laugh at each bad luck bash
And other people would've lost their cool
They were good times
As they were times spent with you confined
The sunshine in the driving rain
You take lemons and you make champagne
there'll always be good times if you don't mind
Fresh frustration, a heap of aggravation
With some irritation on the side
But they were good times'cause you could find
A way to laugh at each bad luck bash
When other people would've lost their cool
And they were good times
They were good times
they were times spared with you
