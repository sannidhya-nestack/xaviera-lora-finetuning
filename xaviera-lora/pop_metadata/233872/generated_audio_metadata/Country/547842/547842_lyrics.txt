I was looking for a job in Paris, looking everywhere
I wanted to have a good time, wanted to breathe the air
Left Hugo breeding Zola, Rambo bottled air
I wanted to feel the Fleur de Mer that I read on the winding stair
Wanted to sit on the metro and watch the people pass
Wanted to get lost in Paris and never come back
But at times it was lonely, American in Paris
Living in a left-bank room, American in Paris
So I looked around and looked around, looked in every window
Looked for a job in the language school in Ramboutout
The owner hailed from Idaho so very far away
Said she didn't like my look if only she wouldn't pay
I think she was very angry at the sight of me sitting there
I didn't know the etiquette but I knew she was unfair
at times it was lonely, America and Paris
Living in a left-bank room, American in Paris
So I looked around some more, winter turned to spring
The leasee girls sat in the park, I passed and heard them sing
Read all the books in the bookstore, Sylvia Beach & Co
Started a dozen novels, but the words they came so slow
But they nobody for weeks
Lived in a frankie day
Live them bread and water started wasting away
And I typed it was lonely American in Paris
Living in a left bank group American on Paris
Oh, the suffering of this artist was almost too much to bear
Damn it all, I finally said, "Do I do her? Do I dare?"
So I took my old guitar out, long hidden under the bed
And went and sang my dillen songs underground instead
Of waiting for an angel to deliver me from despair
Mr. Tambourine Man on the platform there
And at times I felt lonely walking the tracks home at night
In America, longshore Missouri, in the city of light
At times it was lonely, America and Paris
Living in a left-behind room, America and Paris
Ooh, America and Paris
Living in a left-behind probe, American pirates
