In this old town each footprint leaves a memory
Of people who walked this land and souls that crossed the sea
Sidewalks lined with family trees and shadows cast the history of this town
In this old town the farmer and the soldier
Lived, died and sacrificed to keep the land they love
They share a common resting place
It's no tale of the mark they made on this town
Glories found in this old town where Jews fed the dusty ground
Every stick and stone of every home
Bought with blood and sweat, foundation now is set
And filled with distant dreams the seeds were sown
Built a country from this town
This old town walls whisper the story
Of every woman and man with hopes dreams and plans
Side by side they did their part
Shaping what's become the heart of this town
Glories found in this old town where Jews spared the dusty ground
Every stick and stone of every home
Off with blood and sweat, the foundation now is set
In the field of distant dreams the seeds were sold
To build a country from this town
Life in their veins runs through the streets and lanes
The pulse is the essence to reach the strong and proud
Where prayer and perseverance ed this town
Glories found in this old town
Where tears fed the dusty ground
Every stick and stone of every home
Bought with blood and sweat
Foundation now is set
It fills the distant dreams to see it's worth so
To build a country from this town
This town
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
