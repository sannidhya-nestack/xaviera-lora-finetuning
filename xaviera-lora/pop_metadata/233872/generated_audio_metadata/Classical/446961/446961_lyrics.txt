I meet her each night in the midst of a dream
With her golden blonde hair and her eyes of blue green
She throws me a kiss from the top of the stairs
My heart beats so fast as she answers my prayers
How, Rapunzel, spin your golden hair
Our Rapunzel
I love you I swear
How is it this dream
Finds the core of my soul
She can see right through me
And no other dino
Will dance through the night
I hold her so close to me
With such love, I never knew who could be
At the fairy tale ball of my dreams
At the fairy tale ball of my dreams
The minstrels are playing a waltz from my youth
And the gaze in her eyes speaks to me with such truth
Time is forever, it slows to just now
I want this to last forever somehow
Ah, Rapunzel, let down your hair
Our Rapunzel
I love you I swear
How is it this dream
Finds the core of my soul
She can see right through me
And know all that I know
And we dance through the night
And I hold her so close to me
With such love, I never knew who could be
At the fairy tale ball of my dreams
At the fairy tale ball of my dreams
As the party ends, Rapunzel knows
That I must go where mortals go
She whispers her love and kisses my head
As I leave to wake in my bed
How is it this dream
Finds the core of my soul
She can see right through me
And know of it I know
We dance through the night
I hold her so close to me
With such love
I never knew who could be
At the fairy tale ball of my dreams
At the fairy tale ball of my dreams
