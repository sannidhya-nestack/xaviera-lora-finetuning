Come again, sweet love does now invite
Like races that refrain to do me due delight
To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die
To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die With thee again in sweetest sympathy
Come again that I may cease to mourn through thy love
I am kind disdain, for now left and forlorn
I sit, I sigh, I weep, I faint, I die
In deadly pain and endless misery
I sit, I sigh, I weep, I faint, I die
In deadly pain and endless misery
All the day, the sun that lends me shine
I frown to cause me pine
And feed thee with delay
Her smiles my springs that makes my joys to grow
A frown's the winter's all my woe
A smile's my spring's that makes my joys to grow
A frown's the winter's all my woes
For the night
My sleeps are full of dreams, my eyes are full of streams
My heart takes no delight to see the fruits and joys that some do find
And mark the storms, the storms are me assigned
The fruits and joys that some do find
And mark the stones, the stones on me aside
Out alas! My faith is ever true
Yet will she never knew
Nor yield me any grace
Her eyes of fire, her heart of flint is made
Who tears no truth, no truth may once invade
Her eyes of fire, her heart of flint is made
Who tears no truth, no truth may once invade
Gentle love
Draw forth thy wounding dart
Thou canst not pierce her heart
For I that do approve
By sighs and tears more hot than are thy shafts
Detempt was she, was she for triumphal laughs
By sighs and tears more hot than are thy shaft's
To tempt while she, while she for triumph laughs
