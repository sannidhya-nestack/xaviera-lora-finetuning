I can hear the words coming out of my mouth
Don't ask me if I told you I used to have a dick too long
Don't ask me if I told you I used to have a dick too long
(I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge) (I'm standing to the edge, I'm standing to the edge)
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away
Don't turn away, stay this way
Don't turn away, stay this way
Don't turn away, stay this way
Don't turn away, stay this way
Don't let us make it to the end, it's still the victim to blame (x4)
(Don't you dream, don't you dream, don't you dream, don'y dream, don't you dream, don't you dream, don't you dream, don't you dream)
