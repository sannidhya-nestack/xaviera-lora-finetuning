I've looked before, I've fought before
For everyone's approval
It never made me happier
Or furthered my position
I turned my life into a competition
But now I see, I think I see an end to this confusion
To gain the world's acceptance is not the right solution
If I have you, I'm through with my audition
As long as I'm a winner in your heart
I never need to master any art
If I can have your love
What matters to me now
Is to be a winner in your heart
As long as I'm a winner in your heart
I'll never feel the need to stand apart
What matters anyhow is to be a winner in your hall
To win the prize, to win the race is a beautiful illusion
I'll play the game, I'll chase the fame
And look for recognition
But it won't be my life ambition
As long as I'm a winner in your heart
I never need to master any art
If I can have your love
What matters to me now
Is to be a winner in your heart
As long as I'm a winner in your heart
I'll never feel the need to stand apart when I can have your love
What matters anyhow
Is to be a winner in your heart
Show me the trophy
And I'll show you something worth its weight in gold
And more, as long as I'm with her and you're old
I'll never need to muster any old
If I can have your love
It's to be a winner and your own, winner and your own
