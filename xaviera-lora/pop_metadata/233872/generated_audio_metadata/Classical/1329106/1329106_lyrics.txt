All is taken for granted, our time and our home
I will not live unburdened by the thought of miracles
Across the sea of light years expanding growing cold
A single point of the infinite from the vast one miracle
Fourteen billion years out
One hundred trillion to go
That I have found you right here and now
It's a transient miracle
