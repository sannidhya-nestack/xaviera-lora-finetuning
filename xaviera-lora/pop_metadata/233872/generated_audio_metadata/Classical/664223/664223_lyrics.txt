Comfort ye
Comfort ye my people
Come for tea
Come for tea, my people
Set your gun
Saviour God
Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem
Speak ye comfortably through Jerusalem
And cry unto her that her warfare
Her warfare is accomplished
That her iniquity is pardoned
That her iniquity is pardoned
The voice of Him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, Make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
Every valley, every valley shall be exalted, shall be exalted, shall be exalted
Shall be exalted
And every mountain and hill may go
The crooked straight
And the rough places plain
The crooked's fate, the crooked's fate
And the rough place is plain
And the rough place is plain
Every valley
Every valley shall be exalted
Every valley
Every valley shall be exalted
And every mountain and hill may go
The crooked straight
The crooked straight
The crooked straight
And the rough places plain
And the rough places plain
And the rough places plain
The crooked straight
And the rough places plain
