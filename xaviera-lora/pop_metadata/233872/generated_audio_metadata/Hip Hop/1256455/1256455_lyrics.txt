Chilling in the lounge, vibes smooth as crème brûlée
Wish I could cast a spell, make the worries fly away
Got my wand, got my focus, need a potion to swipe
World in my palm, but the colors turning grey
Feeling low key, like a wizard in disguise
Music in the background, sneak through my own eyes
Flick of the wrist, ever can never know lies
Or I'm so serene under twilight skies
If I could cast a spell, troubles gone with the wind
Life a mellow brew, stress in the bin
Magic in the rhythm, addictive times begin
Lounging temptation like a music kid
Sip of my drink feeling mystic in the air
Tones hypnotize weight light as summer air
Whisper to the night secrets that I bear
Casting vibes chill spells everywhere
Moonlight partner dance no shadows on the wall
Eternal whispers in musical rainfall
Yondra and gone in an ambience raw
Magic in moments no boundaries at all
Eyes closed lost in my line of trance
Spellbound in symphony make my heart dance
In the zone proven not by chance
Enchanting ambience, life's expanse
