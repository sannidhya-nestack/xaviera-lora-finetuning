Steppin' through the door, fresh air on my face
Feel the rhythm hum, I'm caught in its grace
Heart stays present, no worry inside
Music swirls'round me, they shine in so bright
Amber drift, I'm moving with ease
Melody shivers right through the breeze
Confidence shining, my spirit's at peace
Amber drift, I'm feeling this release
Friends in my circle, laughter never ends
Colors bloom around, we sway to the blends
Sunbeam steady, the vibe stays clear
Moments unspoken, I'm planted right here
Amber drift, I'm moving with ease
Melody shivers right through the breeze
Confidence shining, my spirit's at peace
Amber drift, I'm feeling this release
Keys in my grip
Coastin' with style
Harmonies dancin'
They guide me a while
Mind stays open
I'm lost in this sound
Every second golden
My rhythm, unbound
Amber drift, I'm moving with ease
Melody shivers right through the breeze
Confidence shining, my spirit's at peace
Amber drift, I'm feeling this release
I sense a hush, then a wave of delight
Locked in this feeling, everything's so right
Riding this drift (Riding this drift)
I'm wearing a grin (I'm wearing a grin)
Amber feels endless, it lives deep within
