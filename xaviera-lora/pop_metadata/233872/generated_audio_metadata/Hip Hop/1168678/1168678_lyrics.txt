Let's take a drive
1222 yeah on my side
Hop up in the coupe than you so fine
Every time I'm with you time flies by
Time flies by
This is something money can't buy
Call you beautiful and you get shy
Compliment my fade like I'm that guy
This is all I want, it's what I like
It's what I like
Everybody asleep
Cruising the city streets
Looking at that fuzzy
Let's hop up in the backseat
Baby you bad and you don't even know it
We both have a past yeah we been heart broken
You can let your guard down we can be open
Pain never goes away we just outgrow it
I got something for you baby
You ain't like them girls who shady
Wanna keep you till I'm 80
Not promised tomorrow so let's make this last
Remember who we are it's what we attract
If today was it and all this collapse
That's why I stay present ain't tryna go fast
City lights, it's the vibe
Got a baddie right here by my side
Time is never on our side
Live for now we all gone die
No rules to this shit so you decide
No rules to this shit so you decide
Let's take a drive
Twelve twenty two yeah I'm outside
Hop up in the coupe damn you so fine
Every time I'm with you time flies by
Time flies by
This is something money can't buy
Call you beautiful when you get shy
Compliment my fate like I'm that guy
This is all I want, it's what I like, it's what I like
