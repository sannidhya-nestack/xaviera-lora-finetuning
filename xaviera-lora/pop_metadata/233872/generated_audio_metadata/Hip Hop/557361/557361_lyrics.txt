Yeah, it's word of mouth when you heard it back, huh?
And this goes out to the ladies
But if you got that special one like me
This goes out to you
You know I've been around the world
Seen a lot of girls
But I really rather get with you
It's you without a doubt
Cause everything about you
Girl looking so brand new
Got me saying hey hey hey
Got me saying whoa whoa
It's your beauty it's your beauty
Yes you're beautiful
The first time
Girl that I saw you
I knew we was meant for love
You were sent from above for me
Yeah, you were so shy
And so unavailable
But something inside me said
That this isn't for real
I finally found my beautiful girl
Beautiful girl
You are my world
Only my God knows how you keep me on my toes (on my toes)
And I don't want nobody else but my beautiful girl
Just can't go unnoticed (just can't go unnoticed)
it builds an appetite to make love all night
Girl, you're gifted
And keepin' my heart at your feet
Look at the hot wheels, look at the high heels
Turn around, look at me, tell me feelings not real
Got earthy, I want real skills, got deals
Keep the bank in the bank, yeah yeah got meals
But when I wakes up, all I need is you
Like the dude from the hangover movie, need a tooth too
You had me jumpin' through hurdles and now through loops
I would do it again and again and again for you
Why you had to be so fine (so fine)
So beautiful
Always getting away with crying (with crying)
Like usual
The beauty was against the law
You'd be guilty as charged
For stealing my heart baby
You are my world
Only my God knows how you keep me almost close
And I don't want nobody else
Oh my beautiful girl, beautiful girl
You are my world
Only my God knows how you keep me on my toes
And I don't want nobody else
But my beautiful girl, beautiful girl
You are my world
Only my God knows how you keep me on my toes
And I don't want nobody else
