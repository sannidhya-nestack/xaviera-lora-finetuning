We got dicks in this house
Leave opinions at the door
We just wanna last
We just wanna be
Just feel the motion
Set us free (set us free)
Set us free (set us free)
We turn the news up, shut it down
Let's close our eyes and lose our minds
Everybody wear a smile, never wear a frown
And bury all the troubles in the ground
et the fights, et debates
We can't be on time, we all be late
Making memories, that's the end
That's break it down, start again
(B-b-b-b-b-b-bullet tick)
We're not dicks in this house, leave opinions at the door
We just wanna laugh, we just wanna be, just feel the motion, set us free
Turn the news, I'll shut it down, let's close our eyes and lose our minds
Everybody wear a smile, never wear a frown
And bury all the troubles in the ground (in the ground)
et the fights, et debates, we can't be on time
We all be late making memories, that's the end
Let's break it down, start again
We're not dicks in this house
