It's the S-H-I to the F-T-X-L-A-T-T, it's the limited edition nigga, fuck you, pay me, I'ma hold your crew, drinking on Bellevue and Grey Goose, having hits feeling my pain, left bleeding in they boots, I speak the truth
Shoot'em the master to the scrab
Just tell who couldn't be me
But should've chopped and had
You think I don't know
You'd be out there shakin' your ass
Tryna knock the folks up
Them lyrics just straight trash
And for me
Rather stay on point like a javelin
Hope they fat the weapons can get
When the rats batter them, shatter them
We kill a Bogart and it's strictly for amateur
Best come clean like Ja Rule for a damager
Lyric equipped with the clip
On the hip, even brain tissues rip
Grab the cleats, I need a grip
See I'm so out my head right now
Trapped in the sounds
You hate to simply mention whispers in the background
To get so ed plays my time to shine
Double A nine, now I ain't even getting a strike prime nigga
You killing me, I'm a fucking veteran
Shoot that rifle next to big and park
Check my letter on
I guess right to the chase, no cutting corners
I'm shooting work of art like Mona, not just some donors
In this rap game, Lil One hit wonders
Don't want none, I'm hitting like God when I unleash my thunders
24 spinner slim sittin on stacks, now my shortys in the front, all my niggas in the back, throw em up
I'm coming through again, D .C. where you at? (where you at?)
My rap attacks ain't nothing'til the back of your sack, black
Don't make me ski-ski all over these tracks, splat
That's how I'm rolling (gangsta strolling)
Cash prep for the fold, now be that shifty bitch that's holding still
Giving love to the fans while keeping it glutted
Stepping on their head and real hating
Motherfuckers just bent face with that platinum, baby
Past prayers, it come to real, these niggas greener than Fugazi
They ain't paying my dues, they've shifted the frame
Constipation got'em all on a strain, held in a clutch by the brain
Kids are the same
What can I say, except my shit be off the maps, ain't like Eminem and Dr. Dre
My rap's phenomenon, they straight feelin'em
Pullin' the flesh off they backs, die hard fans, I'm killin'em
Except you gon' respect the art, if I rip your souls apart
Leave an open leakage in your hearts
Y'all can't deny, iving destiny's a bad thing
Blast some microphones, set the stage, see they minds blown, then I'm gone
Back there, they the only place I'm dropping bombs
Clean up my park, my cars national, fully armed
Take it to the streets, rockin' the urban, went from rock to Sean John
I keep it gangsta, y'all know fuck my enemies or any MC
Don't smoke up your asses B, shit I took the type of fight that never go without feeling me
I'm from the dirty district, all them Dom Pimps and Maxxers
24 spinner slims sitting on stacks, now my shorty's in the front
All my niggas in the back, throw'em up, make some noise, what's up? (This is DC, where you at?)
I'm from the dirty district, all them Dom Pimps and Maxxers
24 spinner slims sitting on stacks, now my shorty's in the front
All my niggas in the back, throw'em up (Coming through again, DC, where you at?)
This the type of hit to get you croaked up in the club
I got the fuck in OJ shorty that's what's up (what's up?)
My dawgs getting they life, wilding for the night
Ain't trick or jump site (we bust your motherfucking head)
I stays off the rock and don't play with me man
That ass is safe quicker than puffin bad boy the band
My Ruga stands what the shit be named to existence
Ya act persistent yet I'm willing to go the distance
So for real I ain't the one to be fucked with dawg
The geek ain't got your number all dick and no balls
Dial them 1-800 bitch make nigga when I call
Just rhymes and no action I forever stand on top of y'all
Just let it be, let the truth speak
Looking smoking 14 without a paddle up Schitt's Creek
Welcome to my world, I'm the life preserver
Stubbley's here but still short, taking that step further
Bitch I'm talking green, got some pop on y'all brooders
Turn their ass out like nudist, forever remaining useless
We making moves, quote hip hop venues
Home of the Gogo, pad them stats on the menu I can't lose
Besides your whole style's a gimmick, you're worthless
I'm like lava on the drip, digging holes in the earth's surface
But stand on top of the games, only way truly living out my life perfectly
All them dog pimps in masks, 24 spinner slims sitting on stacks
Now my shortys in the front, all my niggas in the back
Know I'm up, make some noise so I can see you act
A revolutionary district, all them dog pimps in masks, 24 spinner slims sitting on stacks
Now my shortys in the front, all my niggas in the back
Coming through a gat, DC, you know what? I'm right here, I'm right there, I'm really near (yeah)
KRS, no fear, I'm always in the back and I'm always in the front
KRS don't front, make the whole party jump (hey, hey, hey) (you know what? that was a joke)
You gats can't take it (ha-ha-ha-ha)
