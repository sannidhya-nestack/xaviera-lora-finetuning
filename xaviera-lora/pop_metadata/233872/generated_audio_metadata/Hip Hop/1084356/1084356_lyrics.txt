I'm going psycho, nobody likes guys on Vico
Who keep rolling around on the ground with eyes closed
And skin is ice cold, no breathing
It seems I'm showing all of the signs my life's ghosting
I got none, pulse beginning to convulse
Going to the back of my throat
It seems my tongue's close and there's none frozen
Guess they done posing
They only go wherever they see that the fun goes
And I'm done fighting
He's hiding inside and I'm leaving
I haven't made decisions to decide when
Maybe the day after the end of days
When the world turns not and begins to fade
And all morality and what's right is gone
And I have the strength to live twice as strong
Grow twice as strong
My advice is right this wrong
But it's hard to write this so we write this song
There's something out there scaring me and though I stare
I can only barely see and it's not fair
I can feel it tearing me it's not out there
It's right there in me
There's something out there scaring me and though i stare
I can only barely see and it's not fair
I can feel it tearing me it's not out there
It's right there in me
Yeah, all I need is a beat
All I need is a beat
All I need is a beat
All I need is a beat to unleash this heat speedily
This beast inside he just feasting keeps eating me
The least thinking heat seeking creep stinking
He's me because me is retreating
And though I show the most composure keep rolling in shows
Although my throat is closed up from this thing
I just sing still missing what I wrote
Hope my boat will float up when I
No people wanna kill my show, the fact is
They never gonna feel my flow, oh no, that's him speaking
I know it's not me thinking, this other guy is just trying to sink in
I won't be beating, his homies reaching
Everybody, and that's how you know the fleeting
And I'm the ship, but call me sheepskin
There's a wolf inside, it's designed to eat men
Hey yeah
There's something out there scaring me and though I stare
I can only barely see and it's not fair
I can feel it tearing me, it's not out there, it's right there in me
There's something out there scaring me and though I stare
I can only barely see and it's not fair
I can feel it tearing me, it's not out there, it's right there in me
All I need is a beat
All I need is a beat
All I need is a beat
All I need is a beat to unleash this heat
Speedily this beast inside me just feasting
Keeps eating me the least thinking
Heat seeking creep stinking
He's me because me is retreating
And though I show the most composure
Keep rolling in shows
Although my throat is closed up from this thing
I just sing still missing what I wrote
Hope my boat will float up
Yeah, all I need is a beat
All I need is a beat
All I need is a beat
But I know people wanna kill my show
The fact is they never gonna feel my flow
Oh no that's him speaking
I know it's not me thinking
This other guy is just trying to sneak in
I won't be beating his homies reaching everybody
And that's how you know the fleeting
And I'm the ship but call me sheep skin
There's a wolf inside it's designed to eat men
Yeah all I need is a beat
