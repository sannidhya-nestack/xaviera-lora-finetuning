I want to dedicate this one to all the people out there who feel like they don't have a way
Cause there's a bigger way out there for you, all you gotta do is ask for it, it's out there y'all
There's a way better way, and I know you're trying to find your way
Just keep him first
Keep him first, you'll see everything will be alright
Keep him first, you'll see everything will be all right
Times have been hard but yeah they only seem to get rougher
When you think you strong enough you still gotta be tougher
Than the rest of the world
And the devil got his trick
Cause he come in the form of girls money pearls
And everything he promised really ain't real
And the youth even kill for the skrill
It's a dirty deal
And we lost these days
So I pray the most high can help us find a way
Cause they can't even pick the right path to choose
Another dead child on the evening news
Kids wanna be winners but afraid to lose
Do a little work and start paying some dues
Don't be afraid to succeed cause success
It don't mean drugs, guns, bulletproof vests
Six feet deep on a permanent sleep
You better keep him first and he'll deliver you'll see
Keep him first you'll see
Everything will be alright
Keep him first you'll see
Everything will be alright
There's a whole lot of kids living with they mom
Took two to make but the dad is gone
If mom ain't a slave to the welfare system
She's out working jobs and the children miss'em
It's the way of life but it don't make it right
Cause the kids are the future and the future ain't bright
We gotta get it together
Our families are torn and they don't know no better
That sets the tone for the next generation
And that's no cause for a celebration
Where's the concept, a wife and husband
Teaching the young unconditional loving
I know someday I'll be blessed with a seed
And I'ma be around to give him all he need
I said, I'ma be around to give him all he needs
And keep him first, that's the policy
Keep him first, you'll see
Everything will be alright
Deep in first you'll see
Everything will be alright
Keep him first, you'll never be last
Keep him first, love unsurpassed
Keep him first, for all it's worth
Eternal life and inherit the earth
Keep him first through all the ways you live
Keep him first in every way you give
Keep him first, he'll quench your thirst
And he'll deliver you from all the evil that lurks
Do you walk by faith or do you walk by sight?
All I know is when he come like a thief in the night
I'm tryna roll out with the king of kings
And it ain't triple A
And a wrestling ring
If you got a crooked image better get that straight
See I'm tryna kick the real and others kick the real fake
And everybody's looking for a guarantee
Keep him first and he'll deliver you'll see
Keep him first you'll see
Everything will be alright
Keep him first you'll see
Everything
We'll be alright
I'm gonna dedicate this one
To all the people out there who feel like they don't have a way
Cause there's a bigger way out there for ya
All you gotta do is ask for it
It's out there y'all
There's a way better way
And I know you tryna find your way
Just keep them first, you'll see
Everything will be alright
Keep them first, you'll see
Everything will be alright
