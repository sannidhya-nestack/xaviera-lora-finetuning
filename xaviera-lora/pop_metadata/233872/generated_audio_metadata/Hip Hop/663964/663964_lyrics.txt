You get a yes sir
Stephen King couldn't write him a horrific picture
When you on shaky ground you don't even need the Richter
True I did some things that I ain't really proud of
The way I stay grounded cause I start from the ground up
I-95 in New York City, bam
Came from the bottom so you'll never see him hold me down
Paul Wild Southern draw, dissect the grammar
My crew make bangers not bammers
No manners, no moths
We floss and dig that shit in clubs
You buying bottles with your rent money ain't your cause
They pay me just to show up
Fill a model quote up
And we ain't talking fame when we say she bout to blow up
More bumps than mumps and weakens just the audience
It's all politics man this lifestyle is fraudulent
It's sad when your reflection is perception or suggestion
And we can't take you serious with spurious connections
May not come when you want to
But I'll be there right on time
my grind
my shine
If rap don't work short then I'll be fine
we been so low
That you gotta look up to see now
But we stay down
And you stay down, even with your eyes closed you can see me now, cause I see you now
When you trim off the fakes when you pound on the hate, they wanna see you good not great
All them high fives and invites is driving inside
They wanna snapshot of what your life look like, yeah they copy copy paste
Crop chop and pause
Take a screenshot then photoshop the flaws
And they don't realize that you're being through it all
When your faith is high as heaven you ain't scared of the fall
How dare you look me side eye and say I don't deserve this
Why you in the club twerking I be in the stool working
Dealing with these jerks and still I keep a smirking
Show them they're reflection cause they looking on the surface
It's possible to spot my obstacles without binoculars
But long as God know me what's the point of being popular
Who's stopping or not you
So here come the bandwagon, hop the caboose, poof
May not come when you want to
But I'll be there right on time
Bout my grind, bout my shine
If rap don't work, shawty, I'll be fine
Cause we been so low
That you gotta look up
Two seat down, but we stay down, and you stay down
Leave them with your eyes closed, you can see me now, cause I see sound
Don't be asking me nothing, they ain't got no explanation
The ones complimenting be the main ones complaining
He said, she said, go ahead and miss me
Doubters, skeptics, you know where to kiss me
Oh they wanna call Elle an actress
What about them days I ain't had no mattress
Sleeping on the suitcase eating that ramen
Couldn't cut it with the briefcase
That left rhyming
Bussing these tables
Telling stories from the past
Man it sound like fables
Now I see the real reason can't kill able
Cause even family will go and stick it clean for the paper
Got fifteen minutes on CP time
I guess I better get me mine
If love is blind and justice is a 9 for 9
Well I salute Captain it's our time let's get it
May not come when you want to
But I'll be there right on time
my grind,'bout my shine
If rap don't work, sure, then I'll be fine
we been so low
That you gotta look up to see now
But we stay down, and you stay down
Even with your eyes closed, you can see me now
I see a sound
