Yeah, what's up, baby? (Yeah, what's up, mom?)
So you say you've been watching me for a minute, huh? (Mm-hmm)
Well, I've been watching you, too (Say a word)
You know what they say, right? (What's that?)
That the eyes tell it all (Right?)
But I wanna know one thing, daddy (What's that?)
If I give you what you've been thinking about (Mm-hmm?)
Could you make me say?
Ooh, ah, oh woah, ooh ooh ah
Could you make me say ooh, ah, oh woah, ooh ooh ah
Since I am a freak, focus, sex is what I seek
I could knock you off like seven days a week
It's time to break it down, you know I'm finna break it
Let's go back to my crib so we can get butt naked
I do it in the day, I do it in the dark
I hit it in my crib, oh I could hit it in the park
It really doesn't matter, I'm out to get mine
You're so fine, I wanna hit you with a six nine
So you could molest me
But first undress me if you play like R. Kelly and sex me
The skills and the talent is something I don't lack
Do you like it from the front can you take it from the back
Here's the number to my pager if you want me won't you hit me
So I can turn your ass out like Bobby did Whitney
Take you to my crib and I'ma turn it out
I'll put my love inside and I bet I'll make you shout
Ooh ah oh oh ooh ooh ah could you make me say ooh
Ah, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ah
Let me say ooh, ah
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ah
Make me say ooh, ah
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ah
When I seen her in the club
You know I was scoping
Shorty is the dime in my mind
So I'm hoping if I say the right words
We might get a little closer
Take her to my crib
Rub her back on the sofa
Excuse my expression
Don't mean to be blunt
Shorty I can't front you know exactly what I want
I wrote my number down straight gave it to her
I went to the bar and I copped the Kahlua
Five minutes later I watched her approach
With Alize in hand so we took a little toast
Next thing I know we was chilling at my spot
Started kissing on her neck things started getting hot
I hope you ain't an amateur like night at the Apollo
Don't stop'til I bust and I wanna see you swallow
You can best believe you know I turn'em out
When I put my love inside I bet I make you shout
Ooh, ah, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ah
Could you make me say ooh, ah, oh, oh, ooh, ooh
Ah, could you make me say ooh, ah, oh, whoa, ooh, ooh
Make me say ooh, ah, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ah
I wanna get up in the middle like that song by Moni
Bobby said it best girl you bees a tenderoni
There's no need to front like you're my one and only
I'll be a man about it like that song by Tony
You know how it goes you know what they say
When the cat is away the mouse go and play
So let's take our time there's no need to rush
Between you and me, let's keep it on the hush
You could come to my house or take it to a telly
So I can beat it up like X did in belly
Make you speak that country grammar like Nelly
Tell your man you love him, you can call him on my celly
Cause when I work the middle, you know I turn him out
Face down, ass up, and I bet I make you shout
Ooh, ah, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ah
Could you make me say ooh, ah
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ah
Can you make me say ooh, ah
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ah
Could you make me say ooh, ah
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ah
Oh baby yeah
Ay papi that's just what I like
Ay lo mio
Vaminos daddy
Vaminos
Ay ganindo
Aye, Bobby, aye
