[MUSIC PLAYING]
Looking back at what I've been through it's been crazy
So many moments that I had no chance of saving
Look in the past and those memories are fading
But where I am right now it took a lot of waiting
When you strike it big reach back and then grab someone else
It's more fun sharing riches than keeping them to yourself
Life has its ups and downs gotta learn to face'em
The moments held onto a wasted realize you can't replace'em
Hearing through the eyes of God, would he be proud or disgusted?
Seeing how we treat our fellow men, no need for discussion
Shooting up our own people, foreign terrorism, bigotry
One percent make more a minute than I did a week
Think daily, worked hard for everything I have
Talking about my mother
Worked full time while doing laundry and dishes for me and my brothers
The drive inside my parents minds kept me undercover
In the winter, determination filled our stomachs with dinner
Opposite of what most people think, nothing was ever given to us free
Besides what's welfare through the streets when others make that and they sleep
I wouldn't trade being me for what I could or should be
It's all good, longest I don't have to deal with race to trigger happy beliefs
Looking back at what I've been through it's been crazy
So many moments that I had no chance of saving
Look in the past and those memories are fading
But where I am right now it took a lot of waiting
When you strike it big reach back and then grab someone else
It's more than sharing riches they're keeping them to yourself
Life has its ups and downs gotta learn to face'em
The moments held onto a wasted realize you can't replace'em
Tell you one thing, man, the world has its issues
Power and money are constantly misused
In the 60's as a black, you scared that they would lynch you
Fast forward now, your landlord's praying they can't evict you
The racists on TV, they try to convince you
That gays, blacks and Muslims are trying to omit you
The struggle is real
And it's so hard to get through
But focus on who's really plotting to get you
Wanted to make a change to my current situation
It just seem like generation after generation
40 hour week rotations
Who'd have thought when needed most
The odds would throw me a standing ovation
My patience almost ain't making
Now everyday's a special occasion
Looking back at what I've been through, it's been crazy
So many moments that I had no chance of saving
Look in the past and those memories are fading
But where I am right now it took a lot of waiting
When you strike it big, reach back and then grab someone else
It's more than sharing riches, they're keeping them to yourself
Has its ups and downs, gotta learn to face'em
The moments held onto a waist, they realize you can't replace'em
