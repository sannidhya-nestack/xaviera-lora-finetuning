Emotionless this city lies
Cruel it is it clouds my eyes
The dull, the dark shades of my day
I live inside this place
I see only what I want to see
I'll be only who I want to be
Get it in, get it in
I think it gives me
I see only what I want to see
I'll be only who I want to be
Get it in, get it in
My blanket covers me
You are my living world
You are my living world
You are, you are, you are my, my only living world
I see only what I want to see
I'll be only who I want to be
Get it in, get it in
I think it kills the state
Emotionless this city life
Cruel it is, it clouds my eyes
The dark, the dark shades of my day, I live inside
