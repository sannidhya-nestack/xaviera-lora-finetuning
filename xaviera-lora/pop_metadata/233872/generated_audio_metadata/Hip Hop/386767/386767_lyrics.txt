Look, look, look
(Screaming)
Don't you judge those who try and fail
Why don't you ever judge those who fail to try
Though I try so very hard to understand
And I wonder why, why you wonder why
Why I be this way on judgment day
Y'all better believe I'm sick of the bullshit
Better be dealing with it, gotta make some pasta, see some bullets
Slip of the finger on the trigger, don't wanna make me pull it
Tell them I'm sick of the madness, what are we doing, making a future like Griff?
I don't know why that's a swift thing
I don't really understand what it is that's going on
Cause the bigger the propaganda
The never to know what's right from wrong
You wanna be real but know you never to deal with the real shit
You wanna be real gotta be yourself if ever to deal with this so on
Don't you judge those who try and fail
Why don't you ever judge those who
Fail to try though I try so very hard to understand
And I wonder why, why you wonder why, why I be this way on judgment day
You better be knowin' that judgment day is on and it's like hallelujah
Hoppin' and poppin' inside of the clock'cause shit'll be sayin' booyaka booya raccoon yeah
But it ain't no sleep for me, gotta carry on, gotta carry on
Even if it's over day, yeah better be bubblin'cause the stake is on another day
Better be thinkin' it's just another day you see, uh (a dreadful day)
A day that's filled up with so much misery, so why (when I)
When I'm never to be givin' up and why (shit)
When I'm to the fullest, living the life of the cheese, there's nothing in this world that can hold me
Life ain't complicated, only what you make it to be
What it is, just keep with people, until there's your presence
The consequence, but it speak no evil, until there's your presence
No comments in, but it's just got facts and intentions
I mentioned you say don't bother, until it be bossing and crushing your ass
Just like a finesse, like you see, all it be doing is separate the facts from what's fiction
And give it a rinse to the fullness that is my addiction
So don't you judge those who
Try and fail why don't you ever judge those who
Fail to try though I try so very hard to understand
And I wonder why why you wonder why why I be this way on
Judgment day
What it is that's going on with society?
Everybody out here worried about them C .O.'s
And talking about the rule, don't fuss with me you, that it is a no-no
No more police brutality, malary, salary, there's no analogy
Families matter, me mentality is fatality
I really don't understand what it is that's going on nowadays
I really don't understand but judgement day will make it clear
Fuck that, gotta walk out of my path, up the tracks what you don't really know
You don't hear me though and that is just the way it goes so
So, so, don't you judge the whole zoo
Try and fail, why don't you ever judge those who fail to try?
And I wonder why, why you wonder why, why I be this way young?
Don't you judge those who try and fail
Why don't you ever judge those who fail to try
And I wonder why, why you wonder why, why I am this way?
Don't you judge those who try and fail
Why don't you ever judge those who fail to try?
Judgment day
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
