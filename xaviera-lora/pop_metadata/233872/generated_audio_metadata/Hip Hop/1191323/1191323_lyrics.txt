Let me fill you up
Please turn on my love
Let me fill you up
So you can please turn on my love
You've put everyone first on your list
Let me empty out your mind, baby, come here
You ain't nothing like I've ever felt
Let me give you a love that's sincere, a deep connection
Meaningful expressions, oh yeah, oh
I've been anxious, damn near crazy, yeah
I can't be patient no more, darling
When we feel you up, me turn on my light
On my mind, let me fill you up
So you can turn on mine
You embellish in my atmosphere
Your body on me feels soft as the wind
Let your spirit run wild in this breath
Don't judge anything you do or it's said
Feel my obsession
I'll surrender to this pleasure
'Cause I've been anxious, damn near crazy, yeah
I can't be patient no more, yeah
So won't you let me fill you up?
Let me turn on my love
Oh, let me fill you up
So you can't turn on my love
Connection is timeless
My lips on your body
My sex drive is hiding
Connection is timeless
The silk on your body
Undress what you're hiding
Let me fill you up
Reserve all my love
Let me fill you up
So you can reserve all my love
Let me fill you up
Need to have my way
Can I, can I, can I fill you up
Take what you got
Give back what you want
Taste on my soul
I'll cherish it all
I'm not in a chance shit all
Time to lose
Body
Heartache
