Soul Express train, baby
Ain't nothing like the summertime feel in the field for real
Some stealing kill but me I chill
Built mills on gold grill luxury lining
I claim a piece of freedom before they confine me
Learn braille I'm a blind you get it inside you
Pop off and knock off anyone trying us
Believe we is riders soldier from the giddy up
Like you ain't never seen one man alone hold the city up
BK Versailles, may give it a little pretty touch pretty much
It get pretty slum, 2151 getting me dumb
Cause problems I got a lot of them
Know how to shake em off cause homie I gotta win
Seeing the birds fly, scoping through my third eye
Roll up at yada to see me father when I'm high
Taking when giving up or faking we living
All aboard the soul express train go ahead and get your tickets
Hop on the soul express train
So we gon' give it to you, yeah (we gon' give it to y'all, we gon' give it to y'all)
Come on up on this train express and so
Let's take it back to where we were kings
Controlling with knowledge, power, freedom
I love to read books
Why you act like you don't need'em?
So go ahead, learn what you have what's in the streets
I'm trying to give history a chance not to repeat
So not a lot of people wanna practice what you preach
I got a lot of class and I got an open seat
Vegetarian rap, we don't mess with no beef
I put them things in check, we don't need no receipt
My plan is set like demolition, tick tick
Don't get it twisted, trial burrows in this room
I'm humble, I spend the nights alone
you could catch a charge, grab an ass but not the microphone
The choice is yours, like black sheep, you could get with this
Or you could get with that, or you could set the trap
My crew like auxiliary, the way that we adapt
Lies pull you back but you could benefit from the facts
Back to the future with a busted old Cadillac
And like my pockets, I make sure it's never flat
I'm never strapped, savvy and Mack both got my back while some people affront
Check my soul expression
Hop on the train come and ride with us
No beef no stress just ride with us
No haters no guns just drinks and blunts
Can't et the ladies there
Taking your mind frame to another level
I'll show you why my chains so chiller
Express, let's go, take you on a ride of the express
And so, take you on a ride of the express
And so, haters not invited
You know for the first time, I'm seeing things quite clear
This train was built so you could meet me right here
Nothing in this world is better than what we got now
Why? Cause I can get'em up and I can get'em down
But I'm never found like fake brothers in Bucktown
It's like trying to tell a leprechaun good luck now
Know when them boys said it off you better duck down
Got greasy players feeling stuck now
It's a new episode now we gotta let'em know
Tribe Burrow getting gold first pick is the clone
This one we taking home, love Jones chicken bones
Ginger mama waffle cones, bikinis in silicone
This in my A living so sauce, I'm feeling right at home
I rep Brooklyn, drop Herro and the Cyclones
Mano y mano, let bygones be bygones and so on
Let's get together on this old expression collection
Come up on this train expressing soul
We gon' give it to you, yeah
We gon' give it to y'all, we gon' give it to y'all
Come up on this train expressing soul
All aboard when you're about to take off
