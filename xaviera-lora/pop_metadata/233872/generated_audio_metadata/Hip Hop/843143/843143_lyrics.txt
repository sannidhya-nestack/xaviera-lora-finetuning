I'll stand tall through the hard times can not
Follow keep on fighting
Fork in the road left or right don't know which way to take
Promises I made don't know whether I should keep or break them
Maybe I should just run away go somewhere and hide
Would anybody care if I had died or if I was alive
Can it be me the best thing since insanity
Or will I bankrupt my luck
But I'm never giving up living up to my expectations of being a man
Life is getting pretty, I definitely need a fan
But I'm still in it, I'm still winning
Got a jet a little wet but I will finish this flight
Cause I got a lot of people counting on me
It's a land burden on my shoulders
Nothing ever goes as planned but I'll stand tall
Through the hard times can
Not
Fall
Keep on fighting
Never surrender
Never surrender
Even when you're under pressure
One thing to always remember
Never surrender
Never seen run the white flag, not a chance, never putting down my hands
Afraid of what lies ahead, first time on my own
All of a sudden gone from little man to fully grown
Mom and dad are no longer making my decisions
Substances of drugs and alcohol tryna blur my vision
Friends out to lead me astray but I don't let'em
Think it's cool to be a fool in the school, man I don't get'em
Guess I'm by myself on the top shelf
Rather catch up on my sleep than get a taste of a cop's belt
Tasers and nines, they ain't worth a good time
Stare that F in the city, my room ain't right round
Speaking for the youth of this generation
I'm bout to put a suit on
And chase the rap game's reputation
I'll stand tall through the hard times, can
Not
Fall
Keep on fighting
Never surrender
Never surrender
Remember when you're under pressure
One thing to always remember
Never surrender
Never surrender
White flag not a chance
Never putting down my head
And looking in the mirror through my eyes I see truth and lies
Bright future in my headlights or a quick demise
Depends on the choices you make they all have consequences
Keep control of your spirit and let every evil fear it
I'll stand tall through the hard times again
Not can not fall
Keep on fighting
Never surrender
Never surrender
Even when you're under pressure
One thing to always remember
Never surrender
Never surrender
White flag not a chance
Never putting down my hands
