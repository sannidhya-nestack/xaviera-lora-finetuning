I'm doing this for my people in the struggle
All my homies a juggle all my hustlers
They must've been born to hustle you get your paper max
Nothing in this life is free and I bet if it's free
It probably comes with a fee so you can bet your bottom dollar
On your Gucci or Prada half these rappers in Toronto
Won't be around tomorrow when it is what it is
No pain or sorrow after the sunshine the rain will follow
And that's that man this track's phat
I'm a shout out Swerney Black short dog
A Dub my big brother and them cats from around the way
Smoke a pound a day this Demon Parks it's 83
Kidding we don't play
Put your hands in the air
I said put your hands in the air
Let me hear you scream that life ain't fair
And repeat after me
Ain't nothing in this life that's free
And if it's free it probably come with a fee
Man I'm so sick and tired
Of being so so sick and tired
And I know you feeling my vibe
So if you want it like you want it
Then baby just come and get it
If you don't then you ain't hungry
And maybe you should et it
Man I'm so sick and tired
Of being so so sick and tired
And I know you feeling my vibe
So if you want it like you want it
Then baby just come and get it
If you don't then you ain't hungry
And maybe you should et it
Man, I done came up in the game
Survived the trife life, weighing a buck, some change
Don't fuck with my name, no thanks, I don't fuck with the cane
Don't be acting stupid, son, go in and touch up my chain
Cause them people that I came with, well I deflamed quick
And put something in your motherfucking brain, slick, same shit
Different pile and we been up Schitt's Creek for miles
Still got a coke and a smile though we been broke for a while
Man we bout to get this paper ain't no joking freestyle
Put my back into it plus we doing it like they can't do it
So fluent I'm the teacher you're the student
So you better get your ass to the back of the line
Cause the back of my mind is like the land before time
And I'm Brian Fiery really dying to die in a hurry
And I tell you that the signs are blurry
Man I'm so sick and tired of being so so sick and tired
And I know you feeling my vibe
So if you want it like you want it then baby just come and get it
If you don't then you ain't hungry and maybe we should et it
Man I'm so sick and tired of being so, so sick and tired
And I know you're feeling my vibe
So if you want it like you want it then baby just come and get it
If you don't then you ain't hungry and maybe we should et it
You know this world will chew you up and it'll spit you out
But I was born to twist and shout'til the spliff is out
I was born a different route and since my head popped out
I've been born to make music and I ain't got no doubts
Man I'm built for this shit right here
And I know half of you were probably killed for this shit right here
So just sit right there let me make myself quite clear
Money ain't going nowhere, went from the bottom to the top
Now we back at the bottom, lost but not otten
And we bout to get it popping, low down dirty and rotten, yep
That's what they call me, I tell them fuck you pay me and give me my raw beef
And I'm so sick and tired of being so, so sick and tired
And I know you feeling my vibes, so if you want it like you want it
Then baby please come and get it
Don't think you ain't hungry and maybe we should et it
Man I'm so sick and tired of being so, so sick and tired
And I know you feeling my vibes
So if you want it like you want it then baby just come and get it
Don't think you ain't hungry and maybe we should et it
Man I'm so sick and tired of being so so sick and tired
And I know you feeling my vibes
So if you want it like you want it then baby just come and get it
You don't think you ain't hungry and maybe we should et it
Man I'm so sick and tired of being so, so sick and tired
And I know you feeling my vibe
So if you want it like you want it then baby just come and get it
You don't think you ain't hungry and maybe you should et it
