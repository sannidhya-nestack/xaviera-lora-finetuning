Come on party people in the place to be
Release some stress, put up your feet
Let down your hair, clap to the beat
Let's get this party started on the count of three
Trials and tribulations across the nation
Took down your heads like missing a beat
Trials and tribulations across the nation
Took down your heads like missing a beat
Waking from my dream at 7 .45
This alarm alarm wipes sleep from my eye
Gotta get ready workin' at 9 to 5
Take a shower get dressed hop on the blue line
to lose my mind the train cars packed
Move behind schedule workin' on the track
Hop on the bus can't find a seat
Been late for work everyday of the week
Trials and tribulations across the nations
To turn your heads like missin' a beat
I pay for the day and I pay for the rain
I pay for the pain and I pay for the hate
I wait for my payday to make it away
From the land of the lakes to the bay of the bank
No train but a plane to the place that I play
My name correlates with the famous to date
I ain't tryna say that I can't get a break
Just tired of the trials and the tribulations
Friday afternoon, I just got paid, what happens next
Time to get laid off, middle of the day
Decided to take off didn't like him anyway
So I choose to make off materials, tools for references
Make the example, get the messages
Doc your last pay, see how less it is
Can't feel my pain, like most fetishes, addicted insane
Repetitive smoking and chains
Taking sedatives, all sounds the same
Drinking beverages, push comes a shove
Pulling leverages, whatever it is
Promise you're facing
Take time to think about your situations
Time after time, reliving frustrations
The game of life, trials and tribulations
Trials and tribulations
Across the nations
To turn your heads like missing a beat
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (Trials and tribulations, percolation)
(Percolation, percolation)
(You turn your heads like missing a beat)
