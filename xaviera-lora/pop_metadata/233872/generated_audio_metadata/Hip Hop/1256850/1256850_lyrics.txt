Voices lost in chaos, beneath steel skies, crime coated dreams (crimes, crimes)
Crushed out of souls, wonder, sound of cries I go unheard in the rush, life lines break
Rooting silence, hearts beating in fire (fire)
Wreckage, soul, a soul way up the mire
Dreams shattered, reflections on a wire
Hopeless fights, dirges of a lost choir
Runnin' wild, runnin' wild
Runnin' wild, streets with their tails
False prophets, gold chains
Heat scars, voices lost in chaos
Beneath steel, steel, steel scars
Beneath steel-scaled scars
Crime-coded dreams, crushed by their souls, no chains
Crime-coded dreams, crushed by their souls
Wander, silent cries echo on the herd
In the rush, life lines fade
Born in the rush, life lines fade
Roaming silence hearts beating in fire, in fire
Wrecked souls tearing up the mire, up the mire
Trees shattered reflections on a wire, on a wire
Hopeless fights, dirges of a lost choir
