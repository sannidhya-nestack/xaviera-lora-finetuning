Love, faith and destiny
If you think about it, you know what I mean
Love, faith and destiny
If you think about it, you know what I mean
Destiny
Love, faith and destiny (love, faith and destiny)
If you think about it, you know what I mean (destiny)
Love, faith and destiny (oh yeah)
If you think about it, you know what I mean (destiny) (yeah, you know what I mean)
Yeah you know what I mean
Yeah you know what I mean
The four letters to make that word shake then stir
Is a fake that verse in case you learn
In a Jason Swerve on any path
Chasing birds or dirt roads going a mile
Love shown back ensures I never throw in the towel
Coke in a smile like little kids jump roping
Sun stroking
Crack the fire hydrant open going dumb
Oakland when my funds broken
Know the honest dollar, shirtless with a blue collar
Soul like the home, envision everyone in the kitchen round a pot of collards
Playing cards and shot and holla, what up nephew?
Word to my nieces, some of it's parts, a whole bunch of it's pieces
Provide the whole globe with a breeze for the seasons
Still need a reason, best foot forward during the duration
It's a much bigger figure than what you earn in a paycheck
Makes sense
They sitting sideways like a figure 8
I push it to the limits of infinity
And then you really see
Love fate and destiny (love fate)
If you think about it, you know what I mean
Love, faith and destiny
If you think about it, you know what we mean
Da da da da da, da da da da, da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da, da da da da da, da da da da da da
Na na na na na na (Na na na na na na) (Na na na na na na) (Na) (Na na na na na) (Na) (Na) (Na) (Na)
Love, faith and destiny
If you think about it, you know what I mean (destiny)
Love, faith and destiny
If you think about it, you know what I mean (destiny)
You know what I mean
Yeah you know what I mean
Yeah you know what I mean
Thinkin' about payin' a visit to the Moonrise Kingdom
Just to kick it a bit, you know, get away from it all
If stress be that wool sweater, well I been takin' it off
And flats to pearly whites to pearly gates
I preach a worldly faith and unfurl the weight upon their shoulders
Come take the rest of me
Love, faith and destiny
Yum, taste the recipe
Effortlessly, a total opposite
Covert operative to your corporate plots and scams
I doubt and dash, they zig and zag
No faith up in it, it's a faceless image
Like snapping pictures of indigenous women
And wonder why you shooting blinks
Soulless attempt
Gotta pay respect before you hit the bank with a check
Remember this, the LFD
Life, family, death, love, faith and destiny
And they all intersect
Which is this and this is that
So don't skip a good chance to making it back
Don't speak of chance, chance, impact
With the love, faith and destiny
If you think about it, you know what I mean
Love, faith and destiny
If you think about it, you know what I mean
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da, da-da, da-da, da, da, da-da, da, da, da, da, da, da-da, da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da-da, da, da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da
Love, faith, and destiny (that's my family, love)
If you think about it, you know what I mean (Jasmine)
Love, faith, and destiny (that's my family, love)
If you think about it, you know what I mean (Jasmine)
Yeah, you know what I mean (let it be my family now)
Yeah, you know what I mean (love)
Yeah, you know what I mean (yeah, you know what I mean)
Love is for the faith, faith is for the love
Love is for the destiny you get from above
Hold your head high, don't ever chin low
And if you're feeling down, don't let the shit show
Don't let the shit show, don't let the shit show
That's what my mama said, don't let that shit show
Na na na na na na na na
Yeah, with me
If your mother only knew, knew, knew
If your mother only knew, boom
She was trying to get with me
See I can't do that shit
