I'm glad you came
'Cause you could've been anywhere
So put on your seatbelts
I'ma take you on a fuckin' ride
You ready? Come on!
Figured they'd come at the back, relax, and they'd flip that
I'm tellin' ya fools what you done wanted to do
You can't interfere, man, because I'm about to flip that
Know that what you done wanted to do?'Cause I'm tellin' ya fools
You can't interfere in my crew, I'm'bout to smash you
Ooh, man, let's get it down
I'm tellin' ya when I can kick it down
you know I got the ill sound
You better give me my room, my respect

Guarantee we got more flow, smoke more weed
Got Geico to ensure we stay high
Parachute you like they Bonnie and Clyde
Ain't no smiling for the camera
Gangsta with this shit I'm on my Tony Montana
Money matrimony I stay faithful to the marriage
If you don't get any money homie you should feel embarrassed
Cause the rich is getting richer money thicker than before
Gotta get it cause I know just how you living if you broke
Stunt hard on these haters I don't do this shit for show
I do it just to let them know I ain't no joke
Come on!
Guarantee we got more flow, smoke more weed
Got Geico to ensure we stay high
Parachute you like they bunny o'clock
Guarantee we got more flow, smoke more weed
Got Geico to ensure we stay high
Parachute you like they bunny o'clock
Each and every day each and every weekend
Cause you know I grow thick with my friends
It's like Puerto Ricans we do it on an everyday session
Cause you know I'm telling I'll be blessing
You better back close to soap or cold soap
You stink like emcees need soap
You better wash yourself homie cause I don't play games
Get in your brain and make you straight go insane
Guaranteed we got more flow, smoke more weed
Got Geico to ensure we stay high
Fear shoot you like they bunny o'clock
Guaranteed we got more flow, smoke more weed
Smoke more weed, smoke more weed
Smoke more weed, smoke more weed
Smoke more weed, smoke more weed
Smoke more weed, smoke more weed
Smoke more
