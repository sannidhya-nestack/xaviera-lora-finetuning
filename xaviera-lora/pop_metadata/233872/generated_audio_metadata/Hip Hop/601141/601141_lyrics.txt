Where you going boo? You leaving? What you mean you leaving? After all this time?
Black roses, black roses
Ain't want'em but she gave me black roses
Black roses, black roses
Ain't want'em but I gave her black roses
Hey boo, baby where you off to?
Never thought I'd see the day that I've lost you
Sorry I crossed you, we all make mistakes
You was joking right? Why we taking a break?
Was just thinking'bout raising the stakes
Now I'm a dead vampire, my heart's on the stake
Thought it was one more chance he was willing to take
And now care I am alone just wish you stayed
Though it's really out my power I still gotta try
Such an uphill battle I won't even lie
Got me losing my mind girl I can't even work
Way more than hurt just lost half my earth soul
Won't you come back baby let's run it back
That was only scene one there's another act
Won't you come back baby let's run it back
That was only scene one there's another act
Baby don't go
Don't go, without you, I'm a loco
Don't go, baby don't go, you think I'm playing around?
Baby don't go, I don't want you to go
Baby don't go, oh oh oh, no no
No baby don't go, I don't want you to go
Baby don't go, oh oh oh oh no no no baby don't
Hey love where you think you going
I'm hearing things baby I be knowing
Thought I wouldn't find out what you take me for
All that mess you made just gone make me more
Of a man than I was before
Matter fact other chicks waiting
Baby I be flowing though it hurts my heart
Baby I be growing
Yeah it's hard but I gotta keep going
That was only chapter one there's more to go
Baby let's try again I got a lot in store
That was only chapter one there's more to go
Baby let's try again I got a lot in store
Baby don't go
Don't go
Without you
I'm loco
Don't go
Baby don't go
You think I'm playing around
Baby don't go
I don't want you to go, baby don't go, oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, baby don't go
I don't want you to go, baby don’t go, oh, oh, oh, oh
This is only level one, ain't beat the game yet
Girl you don't even have my last name yet
This is only level one, ain't beat the game yet
Girl you don't even have my last name yet
Black roses, black roses
Ain't want her but she gave me black roses
Black roses, black roses
Ain't want who but I gave her black roses
Black roses, black roses
Ain't one of'em but she gave me black roses
Black roses, black roses
Ain't one of'em but I gave her black roses
Baby don't go, don't go
Without you, I'm a loco
Don't go, baby don't go
You think I'm playin' around (baby don't go)
I don't want you to go, baby don't go, oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, baby don't go
I don't want you to go, baby don’t go, oh, oh, oh, no ,no, no, baby don’t go
I don't want you to go, baby don’t go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ,no ,no
