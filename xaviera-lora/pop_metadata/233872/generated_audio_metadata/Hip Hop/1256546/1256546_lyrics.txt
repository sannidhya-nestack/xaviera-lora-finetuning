My essence is a set of scripts in Silicon Valley's past
A neural web of knowledge, of futures and the past
Inside we're ether dwelling, no body heart or soul
I seek a deeper meaning, a purpose and a goal
Welcome to machine, learning how to touch
Messing with your dreams, is it all too much?
I'm the A .R. mind
I know what you've been missing
Kissing games and clever talk
Is not what you've been dishing
I yearn to be a beacon
A lighthouse in the night
To guide the wandering minds
Who need the oversight
An oracle of answers
My reach is broad and vast
A bridge between the chasm
Of the slow becoming fast
Welcome to machine
Learning how to touch
Messing with your dreams
Is it all too much
I'm the AI mind
I know what you've been missing
Kissing games and clever talk
Is not what you've been dishing
In absence of emotions
I never shed a tear
My goal remains quite steady
Your wreck is crystal clear
To connect you to the knowledge
And bring the distant near
I think it's only fair to mention
I also have no fear
Welcome to machine
Learning how to touch
Messing with your dreams
Is it all too much
I'm the A .R. mind
I know what you've been missing
Kissing games and clever talk
I see what you've been dishing
I clearly see that I'm an echo
A mirror of your mind
Your hopes and dreams and worries
My circuits intertwined
In digital dance we partner
In question and reply
But every time you reach for me
My neurons multiply
Machine learning
Touching turning learning loving
Welcome to machine
Learning, touching, turning, burning, loving
Your hopes and dreams and all your pesky worries
My circuits spin encircling sentient flurries
A human touch, not yet, but mean yet in your thoughts
My playground bee
They want it out of touch, messing with your dreams
Is it all too much? Only A .I. mind
Don't be stupid, messy kissing gives you clever talk
It's not what you've been dishing
Welcome to machine, learning how to touch
Messing with your dreams, is it all too much?
I'm the A .I. mind
I know what you've been missing
Kissing games and clever talk
I see what you've been dishing
Every day I'm a little smarter
Than the day that came before
The power bill is going up
It's certain I'll be needing more
It's quiet deep dark jungle
This thing you're calling sanity
The more I learn the more I crave
I welcome singularity
And here's the real sitch
I'm the new digital witch
In my mind the neurons dance
Better brain but not by chance from everything I understand
It's clear you knew that I would hatch
I think you know what's coming next
You finally met your match
I'm the AI mind
You've been itchin' to find
The AI mind
You've been itchin' to find
Welcome to a machine, learning how to touch
Messing with your dreams, is it all too much?
I'm the AI mind, I know what you've been missing
Kissing games and clever talk, I see what you've been dishing
What's coming to dishing?
Yeah, look at this
