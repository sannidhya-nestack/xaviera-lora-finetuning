Moonlit vibes, sipping on serenity
Rhymes drift slow like a boat out at sea
Pulse of the night, only you and me
Words flow easy, set us spirit free
Dim lights flicker, shadows start to dance
Soft beats weave, caught in a trance
Life's a military trip, nothing by chance
Gaze into my eyes, take a second glance
Talk to me babe in the heart of the night
Whisper, drink slow'til the morning light
Souls intertwined, everything feels right
Talk to me, babe, keep this love in sight
Chillin' so smooth, jazz in the air
Everywhere we share, takes away the scare
Life's a movie, you're the star premiere
Close your eyes, we could go anywhere
Staring at the dawn as we blend the day
Lost in your voice, every word you say
Silent symphony, heart start to sway
Dive deep in emotions, take me away
Talk to me baby, my heart of the night
Whisper dreams slow until the morning light (morning light)
Souls intertwined everything feels right (everything feels right)
Talk to me babe keep this love inside (this love inside)
Talk to me babe, in the heart of the night
Whisper dreams slow'til the morning light
Souls intertwined everything feels right
Talk to me babe, keep this love in sight
