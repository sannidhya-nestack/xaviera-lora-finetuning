One day soon, life's gonna let up, something's gonna have to give, I won't give up, ever, I'm just fed up, I stay bitter, I can't take it no more, but I figure that one day soon, life's gotta let up, it keeps on knocking me down and I get up, forever, I'm just fed up, I stay bitter
I can't take it no more, so I figure that
I lack a lackadaisic attitude, I have to make it
Will I capture what I'm after, one of the baddest or the greatest?
My name being established isn't really all that matters
Traveling down this path, something difficult to manage
Was it really worth me to merge into this circus?
Timing ain't perfect, I can't break the surface
Detroit, Michigan's underground circuit doesn't serve as my purpose
Got a little pay raise from A-phase, I'm workin'
My pockets always hurtin', never stopped me rockin' verses
Got kinda nervous, I'm not quite certain if my sound surrounds hip-hop
A hip-hop suburban, disturbed but I learned it was a conversion
Mastered my package, shrink wrapped it for the merchants
To put it up for purchase, diverse with my words
Virtually determined to turn my little world into something more permanent
One day soon, life's gonna let up
Something's gonna have to give, I won't give up
Forever, I'm just fed up, I stay bitter
I can't take it no more, but I figure that
One day soon, life's gotta let up
It keeps on knocking me down and I get up
Forever, I'm just fed up, I stay bitter
I can't take it no more, so I figure that
Life's like a curveball, a bad hand of cards
I demand some demances
Handstands and cartwheels through hula hoop loops
Just to get you to see the truth
I used to rap for fun (that's right)
And that was an excuse to abuse alcohol with my dogs and get boozed
My youth? History, nah my mood shifting
Someone's gonna me off, try to talk when I'm not listening
If this thing falls through and the ship sinks
You gon' see me on the bench swimmin' up
It's creak, it's please, maybe it's just me
The industry seems to be a striptease
It'll leave me flat broke and put me back on the street
Like that, cut the show, I didn't get the blow
Never got to touch anything to turn to gold
I wouldn't be the one to wonder why life's a waste
I'll continue at this pace, feel it when I say
One day soon life's gonna let up
Something's gonna have to give, I won't give up
Ever, I'm just fed up, I stay bitter
I can't take it no more but I figure that one day soon
Life's gotta let up
It keeps on knocking me down and I get up
Forever I'm just fed up
I stay bitter
I can't take it no more so I figure that
I'm in the wrong place at the right time
In my life I sport a long face
I work long days and long nights
No one likes me anymore I morph
People think that I'm a storm
More like a hurricane off course
Better lock your doors, reinforce your house
Yeah, hide on all fours
I'm alive, never died, wish I could time warp
Back to the days, hanging out on my porch
Kick a couple rhymes, yeah, try to find someone to buy fours
Man, I didn't give a crap back in them days
Can't explain what happened, I'm glad I made it halfway through the maze
Amazed that I came to the game with integrity people
Jealous of me hoping that I fall off, I laugh as I hold on
This roller coaster's no fun, I've been feeling so numb
Even if I had emotions wouldn't be able to show none
What's it gonna take for B blank to be at peace
For me to find a piece of mind so mine can be at ease
I live to write rhymes, same time hit the beats
I disagree with the game and shake my head in disbelief
Thinking one day soon life's gonna let up
Something's gonna have to give, I won't give up ever
I'm just fed up, I stay bitter
I can't take it no more
But I figure that one day soon
Life's gotta let up
It keeps on knocking me down
And I get up (forever)
I'm just fed up
I stay bitter
I can't take it no more
So I figure that one day soon
Life's gonna let up
Something's gonna have to give
I won't give up (ever)
I'm just fed up
I stay bitter, I can't take it no more
But I figure that one day soon life's gotta let up
It keeps on knocking me down and I get up
Forever I'm just fed up, I stay bitter
I can't take it no more so I figure that
