Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Crazy classes of cliques and crews
All of different heritage and aptitude
To adjust to the fuck that we bust
It's a must so I gotta stop breaking down for you
Do you look to the sky?
Do you wonder what's falling?
Do you think of mankind?
Or the block you evolve in?
Do you educate yourself?
Or you worry about your health?
Do you think before speaking? Do you listen to reason?
Do you always come hating? Are you really perpetrating?
Better check the cards you hold, these curtains will unfold
Now these crazy classes of cliques and crews
All brought together, now in this room
By the D .O .T., Master of the Ceremony
You got the wrong idea, running in here
This is what we gonna do, I know you trying real hard
Deserving a award, that style ain't nothing new
Cause people wanna step into the scene but why?
Everybody wanna give up, why?
Yo, come on give up, why?
Yo, come on give up, why?
People wanna step into the scene but why?
Everybody wanna give up, why?
Yo, come on, hip-hop, wow
Yo, come on, hip-hop, wow
Must underestimate it, intoxicate it
Still create a style and spot like Rain and Pop
You wanna get it hash, we already here
Too slow in the temple in the mento
Catch the pace, I hop a Conte from San Antone
On the road again to a foreign land
Anonymous in Dallas, how I stand today
Unpredictable tomorrow in the line you follow
In the world you borrow but your thought brain hollow
There's the truth, so swallow
Choking on your ego on the dance floor
Too pushy player, she don't wanna dance no more
Or just paint Tamra f***in' hostile, make the same mistake
That's why it's been a while, my advice, switch up the style
Approach on the cool collective and call'em the Vogue Wild
You got the wrong idea
Running in here
This is what we gonna do
I know you trying real hard
Deserving the award
That style ain't nothing new cause
People wanna step into the scene but why?
Everybody wanna give up why?
Yo come on give up why?
Yo come on give up why?
People wanna step into the scene but why?
Everybody wanna get buckwild
Yo, come on get buckwild
Yo, come on get buckwild
Who they besides off the whole night
Wouldn't be rap if it all would go right
So tight, clientele shady
Just a bunch of thugs with no ladies
So maybe you would see
But it seem like y'all ain't got a clue to me
Lose your ste, it ain't that hard
Cause we ain't in jail and this ain't the yard
You paranoid, won't even dance
It'd be funny if that toy got off in your pants
Check your safety, I bet you hate me
I accept that, yo, beat is greedy
Just know off your pride as punction
That you probably that same damn dumb herd
One word, enough, I had it
Then I keep moving on without the baggage
You got the wrong idea, running in here, this is what we gonna do
I know you trying real hard, deserve an award, that style ain't nothing new cause
People wanna step into the scene, but why? Everybody wanna get bucked, why?
Yo, come on get bucked, why? Yo, come on get bucked, why?
People wanna step into the scene, but why? Everybody wanna get bucked, why?
Yo, come on get bucked, why? Yo, come on get bucked, why?
