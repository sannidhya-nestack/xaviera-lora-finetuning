Did you ever have a wish for a girl who could inspire?
A ten thousand year itch of hella hot desire?
Well let me introduce you please to a girl who fits the bill
I think she took the little red kill, she's a sight to see
This money's far worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She struts in her high heel shoes, life's gotten better
She got everything to lose
Fashion so fly, you have to get an airplane seat at what cost?
Love's the pretty petty, come and get some, would you like a little treat?
Turning heads everywhere, trust me, there are very, very many
She's a little more than filthy rich, one tough bitch
Welcome to the sweetness, oh, miss money
You're one sexy sweet honey
Is it fame that you adore, miss money?
Now you got a little, would you like a little more?
Missing money, sweet little honey
I can see that you are vexed
Take a minute, check your mobile
Tell me if you got my text
Flexible finesse and I can see that you've been messing
With some things I think you think that you'd have never seen before
She's got a wallet that is quite the little fatty
Generous, she is very, very, very catty
Buying up the love, it's something that she can't ever seem to get enough of
Of a swipe of a card, like to play the part
Crashing you very hard, in the market for a heart
All in this money, you're a fantasy
I think about you every day, I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person to a person in your life
Maybe you're a girlfriend, maybe you're a wife
Miss Marty, oh, she's no dummy
Buys love, but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of greed in her eye
She's a disco berry, fluttering by
She's got a stock policy in minors
They're all just the assets that are fueling her desire
She trades her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment, not selling just to pocket
The laughter rings like a cash register chime
But her love's a currency she can't seem to mine
A portfolio of heart, oh what a portfolio
Of the deepest ends of love
She'll never really know this money
Oh, she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of greed in her eyes
She's a fiscal fairy, ploddering by
A market of romance she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh how she'll spend to seize
She's a penny pincher with a golden touch
But the cost of love it seems too much miss money
Oh the irony's not lost
Can't budget for love it's an endless cost
Now she's bankrupt in the market of hearts
A fiscal failure torn apart
But oh miss money, you're still a sight
In the cold hard cash of the night
Miss money, oh she's no dummy
Buys love hearts never ever jummy
With a twinkle of green in her eye
She's a disco fairy fluttering by
Oh head to the party, the bell on the wall
You'll have to feel it boom
Mocking romance, she mildens with ease
But her assets are cold, they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh how she'll slay disease
She's a penny pincher with Belle of the Balmy
Your assets be liquid
