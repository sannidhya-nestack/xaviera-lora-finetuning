Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

It's a hot mess in here
A fiesta, a frenzy, oh dear
It's a rough wild mix
Welcome to my bag of tricks
What's going on in there
With the madness in the air
It's a smooth sweet fix
That's my bag of tricks
The way you look
Look at me, baby, oh
It's driving me crazy
So why don't we get up in the mix
With my bag of tricks?
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-ba, da-da-da-da-da da-ba
Da-da-da-da-ba-ba, da-da-da-da da da da
What's that sound in the air with the drums and the dancing flare?
It's a popping tight kick, that's my bag of tricks
What's that shine on you?
With the lights and the moon and the view
It's a dark sweet bliss
That's my bag of tricks
The way you look at me
Baby oh
It's driving me crazy
So why don't we get up in the mix
Let's explore my little bag of tricks
What's that sound in the air
With the drums and the dancing flare
It's a popping tight kick
Welcome to my bag of tricks
My hot little bag of tricks
What's that shine on you?
With the lights and the moon and the view
It's a dark sweet bliss
You can blame it on my bag of tricks
The way you look at me
Baby, oh, it's driving me crazy
So why don't we get up in the mix?
And check out my bag of tricks (my bag of tricks) (my bag of tricks) (my bag of tricks)
(No bag tricks)
Yeah, no clima, no pique, no som, vambora
Na batida quente eu chego sorrateiro
Mistério no olhar tipo um feiticeiro
Ela joga charme, dança, não resiste
Segredo guardado no bag tricks, uh
Luz piscando, suor no chão
Coração pulando feito um trovão
Caí na magia sem truque
Barato o show começou
Prepara o espetáculo
Can you handle the heat when I turn up the flame?
It's a show, it's a spark, not a game
One kiss, one fix, that's the fire in my bag of tricks
Step in close, don't be shy
Wanna see what's behind my eyes
There's glitter, chaos, sugar and sin
Once you're in, you're never out again
I spin, I flip, I burn, I tease
Whisper your name with the magic breeze
No smoke, no mirrors, just my mix
You're caught up now, in my bag of tricks
