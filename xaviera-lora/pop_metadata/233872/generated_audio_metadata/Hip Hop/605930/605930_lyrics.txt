Dealer rule, baby, you know I ain't playin' fair
You know when I get in, everybody say the man
Hell, when I talk about it, be about it, say I'm ready to rear
Said it before, I'm just makin' sure you made aware
Five-three, but I'm large in a life
You can only pay attention when the charge of the mic
And when I move it, you will lose it, I'm the star of the night
Hear about me, you'll be smart to invite
And baby I'm a student of the game, pay homage and write
And without it, it'd be hard to recite
And who cares if you root against me, looking for some flaws in my plight
Nah, listen, I'm taking off with the flight
Now watch it when I bring it back, make you feel right at home
I'm just working on my craft when I spend these nights alone
You see I got the vision, the vision what I'm living for
When I'm in this booth, it's where I'm giving more
Now let me remind you, I am the best
You can say whatever, I'll never settle for less
We are
And you won't
You can't stop me cause I'm in the zone
Now let me remind you I am the best
You can say whatever I'll never settle for less
Yes I'll never settle for less
No matter what the odds no stress
They told me to be patient but I'm chilling
I was waiting for the time for me to strike
And y'all still was contemplating
So I had to make my move knowing I ain't came to lose
There's nobody who I'm on with as long as I pay my dues
I know you can see it what you see is what you getting
Everybody wanna peace they tryna meet me in a split
I made it all look seamless gets no easier than this
All about the future not the past don't need to reminisce you need to
Let it go
Hey I'm taking over
You can feel it in the air
And it ain't the same aroma
I can give you what you want
And they tryna make it quota
And ya'll wonder why that I would say it's over
You see it that I'm on it now
Tell them that it's going down
See it that I'm focusing
You looking at me zoning out
I know you wanna
Get involved with me loving how I'm doping
So tell them that it's over and I'm coasting
Now let me remind you
I am the best
You can say whatever
I'll never settle for less
We are
And you won't
You can't stop me cause I'm in the zone
Now let me remind you I am the best
You can say whatever I'll never settle for less
Yes I'll never settle for less
No matter what the odds no stress
Beast mode
Beastin'
Now tell me bae if you feel it increasing
We are we are the future
This is a new us
And I am too clutch to feeling this unreal
It's how how the sun fell
It's how number one feels
You are a done deal
I am one in the trail
Now let me remind you I am the best
You can say whatever I'll never settle for less
We are and you won't
You can't stop me'cause I'm in the zone
Now let me remind you I am the best
You can say whatever I'll never settle for less
Yes I'll never settle for less
No matter what the odds no stress
Now let me remind you I am the best
You can say whatever I'll never settle for less
We are and you won't
You can't stop me cause I'm in the zone
Now let me remind you I am the best
You can say whatever I'll never settle for less
Yes I'll never settle for less
No matter what the odds no stress
