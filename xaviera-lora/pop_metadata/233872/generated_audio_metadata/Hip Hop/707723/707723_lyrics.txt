Just filled out another application
Cause I gets nothing if I use procrastination
My enemy got me racing
And then I pace it
And then I realize that's only the mirror that I'm facing
It's been a long time coming up in this rap game
I'm starting to feel like I'm in the hood a little of a crap game
If I was standing up on the corner would you give me change
Or would you simply walk past like it's a damn shame
It's kinda hard when you ain't never got your GED
To find a job they looking at your drug felonies
And my background ain't close to squeaky clean
I used to weigh out a lot of my hopes on a triple beam
And I know I must have made a few mistakes in my past
Gotta raise my kids right so they don't go the same path
If I could rewind time I would be a college grad
But since I ain't gotta try to make some good about this band
What can I do? (What can I do?)
To change the situation
Barely holding on to my hopes and dreams
But what can I do, what can I do, what can I do
To change the situation
I know I can't achieve all my hopes and dreams
But what can I do? What can I do? What can I do?
Seems like this world is coming to a bitter end
Everybody walking around like revelations
I'm in the streets doing multiplication
Just trying to make it to my destination
And I ain't got no call for no interview
I guess it's pretty typical for a young black man like me
So what do you expect me to do? Gotta do something illegal
Cause in these streets you either starve or you eat
And opportunity never knocks in my door
I gotta work hard to accomplish my dreams
In my community there's really no hope
And I bet you'll be scarred if you seen what I seen
Or felt what I felt
Or been what I've been through
Take a walk up in my shoes and see my life's not that simple
If I could rewind time I would be a college grad
But since I ain't
Gotta try to make some good about this band
What can I do? (What can I do?)
To change the situation? (To change the situation?)
Barely holding on to my hopes and dreams
But what can I do? (What can I do?)
What can I do?
(What can I do)
To change the situation (to change the situation)
I know I can't achieve all my hopes and dreams
But what can I do (what)
What can I do (what)
What can I do (what)
Man, they just denied my application
Gotta leave that part blank
When it comes to education
I do meet the qualifications
But since y'all say it ain't on paper then it ain't no conversation
My family never got no 40 acres
And if I finally got it they would try to find a way to take it
I'm just wondering why the ghettos hate it
And why y'all say that I will never make it
Y'all want me to work on minimum wages
Work from check to check
Make me bust a sweat, gets no respect
Cause my background criminals wrecked
I hope by now I get my point across to whom it may concern
Gotta get this pain up out my heart because it really burns
We need some solutions, so we can stop all the pollution
If I could rewind time, I would be a college grad
But since I ain't, gotta try to make some good about this band
What can I do (what can I do)
To change the situation (to change the situation)
Barely holding on to my hopes and dreams
What can I do? What can I do? What can I do?
To change the situation? To change the situation?
You know I can't achieve all my hopes and dreams
What can I do? What can I do? What can I do?
