Yeah, yeah
Hey, let's go
Rise up, we ain't falling down
We've been through the fire but we wear the crown
No fear, no doubt, we stand our ground
Turn the pain to power, hear that victory sound
Woah, woah, woah
Rise up, we ain't slowing down
Woah, woah, woah
Keep pushing we gon' run this town
Started from the bottom yeah they counted me out
Had to fight through the struggle now they hear me loud
Every setback just a set up for a major rebound
I was lost in the dark but now the sun came out
Look took my losses turned them into lessons
Every tear that I shed was just hidden blessings
Had to grind through the storm now the days look brighter
Ain't no limit to the sky when you're born a fighter
They tried to break me but I never fold
Heart still strong and my soul stayed bold
Now I stand tall with the stories untold
Watch me write my name in gold
Rise up we ain't falling down
We've been through the fire but we wear the crown
No fear no doubt we stand our ground
Turn the pain to power hear that victory sound
Rise up we ain't slowing down
Keep pushing we gon' run this town
They said I wouldn't make it but I proved them all wrong
Now they singing every lyric when they hear my song
From the nights in the cold to the days on stage
I put in that work now I'm out the cage
Every door that was locked I just broke right through
Did it all for my people now we all shine too
Ain't no dream too big ain't no goal too far
Every scar that I got is just part of the art
If you got a dream gotta chase it down
If you take a hit get up off the ground
No one's gonna hand you the keys to the crown
So we rise, yeah we rise, say it loud
Rise up, we ain't falling down
We've been through the fire but we wear the crown
No fear, no doubt, we stand our ground
Turn the pain to power, hear that victory sound
Woah, woah
Rise up, we ain't slowing down
Woah, woah
Keep pushing, we gon' run this town
Yeah, yeah
We rise, we rise
Aye, aye
No fear, no lies, yeah yeah
We're, we're strong, we fight
And we shine like city lights
