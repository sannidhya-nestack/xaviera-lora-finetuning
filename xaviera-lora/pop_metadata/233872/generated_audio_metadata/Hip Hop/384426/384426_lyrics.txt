I've returned what we taught, react with honorable mention
I don't mean to sound too pretentious
Pull back the curtains, unveil the stage
Relax your mind to the fact we're all engaged
We partake in evolution and it's so inviting
All the meanwhile we avoid the hype we
Relax your nerves, I help your mind curve
I leave your ear drums draining on the drip of my words
Upon the drip of my words
Leave no stress on the dance floor in a pool of sweat
Lay back upon the night like no regret
Keep burning as we yearning for your funky head check
And there ain't no better way to get this day on my chest
I'm blessed with your attention and a rhyme to slay
My mind starts to twitch entering alternate states
A warm type of fuzzy that I can't condone
D .O .T. to the table and we bringing it home
Cause we back up in the house y'all once again
With the vibe that's alive from run to end
Never leaving you hanging
Cause we know that you paid
To relax your mind and let your soul escape
Back up in the house y'all once again
With the vibe that's alive from run to end
Never leaving you hanging
Cause we know that you paid
To relax your mind and let your soul escape
No thank for your buck I know that feeling at two
When cover was ten ducats
Seems you were screwed bamboozled
Led us straight with a remedy
With D .O .T on stage you feel it here the energy so
Just cool out, take shots and be merry
Release worry like tonight's your last chance at it
Cause we coming with it, got the ball running with it
In a Heisman pose, with the force of a titan blow
No biting though, bob your head, let me see you
You ain't heard nothing, this is just a teeny preview
You ain't heard nothing, this is just a teeny preview
You ain't heard nothing
We back up in the house y'all once again
With the vibe that's alive from front to end
Never leaving you hanging
Cause we know that you paid
To relax your mind and let your soul escape
Back up in the house y'all once again
With the vibe that's alive from front to end
Never leaving you hanging
Cause we know that you paid
To relax your mind and let your soul escape
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Feel the breeze as I wind whip emcees with the release
Shaving my fleece, getting comfortable, strutting like Constable
Loving the jazz, holding my waist when it comes to the fact
Cycle full circle on a lunar path
Typical seasonal out like abacus math
Just a slide from the back, D .O .T. on the track
With the flame to the map like Bonanza
Red eye from Smoke Signal
No more interview, time to peripheral
My inquiring mind, are we skeptical?
At every angle, that's pivotal
We deep in the jungle and every moment is critical
Back up in the house y'all once again
With the vibe that's alive from run to end
Never leaving you hanging, cause we know that you paid
To relax your mind and let your soul escape
Back up in the house y'all once again
With the vibe that's alive from run to end
Never leaving you hanging, cause we know that you paid
To relax your mind and let your soul escape
