Chilling in the twilight, I see my Lady Jane
Moonlight on her, oh she's my champagne
Rosy smile, piercing spark off my chain
Everywhere she speaks is a love filled refrain
In the city thoughts she my quiet retreat
Candle lit dinners, ninth boutique
Cherish every moment, embrace unique
Our love hits harder than a classic beat
Lady Jane, hear my sunset and dawn
Life's melody on your love I spawn
Eyes locked and the world's just gone
Together we'll rise to the break of dawn
Cool breeze whispers in my summer rain
No need for words love flows like a vein
Every glance she throws hearts to rain
Never knew warmth till I met Jane
Golden hours pass our story untold
A hand in mine loves precious gold
Life's canvas painted no need for bold
With her by my side I'll never grow old
Lady Jane you're my sunset at dawn
Life's felony on your love I spawn
Eyes locked and the world's just gone
Together we'll rise to the break of dawn
In the city buzz, she my quiet retreat
Candle lit dinners, night's boutique
Cherish every moment, embrace unique
Her love hits harder than a classic beat
Lady Jane, you're my sunset and dawn
Life's melody, on your love I spawn
Eyes locked and the world's just gone
Together we'll rise'til the break of dawn
