Change in the world one step at a time
That's all we can do
Life imitating art
Art imitating life
Hide his own little prize
Genocide in the Sudan
Bloody hands
To achieve a convoluted plan
Uncle Sam spends forty bill
The price tag on the toes of those countrymen who get killed
The 9 /11 Commission insisted that the intelligence gathered was fair and inconsistent
It was all lies, burning of the bush
Liberty and justice for none
Eye for an eye leaves everybody blind
Left picking up the pieces of broken promises
My mama says keep your chin up
Through the mock and the murder
Everything is fine, I heard you once or twice before
You ignored all the warning signs
It is the dream, wait until the morning light
Nothing's changed, the situation's worsening
Before you know it, the whole world will be blowed
The fuck to oblivion unless change is in place
That will be the end of the human race
This is a taste of the future foreseen, act hastily
I better watch what I say, black ties chasing me
Those who refute the change stay that way
Those who break the cycle make change for better days
For better days
Imagine it
Today is never guaranteed
Tomorrow's never promised
One second at a time, one second at a time
Inside your mind, inside your mind
And I will find you inside of me, inside of me
I'm on my way, you follow me
Huh, media lies, see it in your eyes
Spies try to infiltrate secrets deep inside
Though I try to block it all out, time to call them all out
Prisoner of your mind, that's what I'm talkin'bout
I'm the motherfuckin' man with the skeleton key
People see me duck down, take cover, make brothers feel the real
My skill, far beyond the ill
I see you over there, standing at the boob tube
Taking everything coming through to you
Junk food for the brain
All I'm saying is stop vegetation, live life
Stop playing it, entertainment seems to be your way out
I suggest you break out, free stuff
You're fresh out of luck, break the cycle
You can do it if you try to
You can do it if you try to
The seasons change like the rain falls into winter
The cold weather starts to settle in
The leaves begin to tumble to the earth
Floating gently on waves seemingly reminded me
Of a dream that I had once before
Then I awoke to a world that closely resembled hell
I wish I would've fell back into a state of subconsciousness
Where everything is everything, sixth sense enhanced
Beyond the point ever conceived into what?
You and me call reality
I'm not speaking of the things that aren't tangible
Imagination stretch farther than a third eye blind to the simple fact
That our mere existence is an indication
That there's much more to it than what most wish to believe
More than what is written on paper
Every ideology has a similar message
To all those seeking answers to questions
So many beliefs but still you seek
Listen to the words that I speak
Live life
