Stop, drop, roll, stop, drop, roll
Redemption is here if you ready or not
Can't stop the heat cause I'm burning hot
Stop, drop, roll, stop, drop, roll
Redemption is here if you ready or not
Can't stop the heat cause I'm burning hot
It's been a minute since I did it alone
Since 1991 blessing microphones
2008 bringing heat and flame
Rap is a business, rap's not a game
It ain't Milton Bradley or Parker Brothers
A biz full of bad and janky mother
Learned the hard way with the cards I was dealt with
But it'll never happen again if I can't help it
As a man you gotta stand your own
Though I ride with a clique I still stand alone
Life is a classroom of blessings shown
The true measure of a man is how much one has grown
Ignorance is why heads get blown
Intoxicated on the truth, you getting drunk on Patron
Open your eyes instead of opening thighs
And maybe open a book and catch a word to the wise
Stop, drop, roll, stop, drop, roll
Redemption is here if you're ready or not
Can't stop the heat cause I'm burning hot
Stop, drop, roll, stop, drop, roll
Redemption is here if you're ready or not
Can't stop the heat cause I'm burning hot
I'm blessed to have an opportunity to express a debt of gratitude
Even though it's a bad attitude
Those who say my name and they talk that lip
But they smile in my face and they be on my tip
I really can't trip I only wish him the best
In the end the best revenge is to be a success
I'll take free promotion spell the name right
Include a dot com and keep my paper tight
I'm a grown ass man and I hate to fight
Since I'm smarter than the average bear on the mic
I hit'em with knowledge and I kill'em with kindness
I might ignore a lot but don't mistake it for blindness
Third eye vision and it's ever so clear
They say the truth hurts but it's never to fear
And Sang laid the track and I laid the rap
With a one-two punch laying cats on they back
Stop, drop, roll
Stop, drop, roll
Redemption is here if you're ready or not
Can't stop the heat cause I'm burning hot
Stop, drop, roll, stop, drop, roll
Redemption is here if you ready or not
Can't stop the heat cause I'm burning hot
It's a thin line between love and hate
Those who contribute and those who take
Those who make moves and those who wait
Those who stay true and those who fake
Those that deliver and those that flake
Those who stand strong and those that shake
Those that are blind and they walk by faith
Those who see the tricks and still bite the bait
The world's kinda dark and it's hard to see through
I trust nobody, it's just how we do
Dropped a lot of people in the previous year
The words and the actions were devious here
No French connection but c'est la vie
The day I go out'll be the day I be
Caught with a lack of focus
Grounded in reality so you can keep the hocus pocus, stop
Drop, roll, stop, drop, roll
Redemption is here if you ready or not
Can't stop the heat cause I'm burning hot
Drop, roll, stop, drop, roll
Redemption is here if you ready or not
Can't stop the heat cause I'm burning hot
Roll, roll
