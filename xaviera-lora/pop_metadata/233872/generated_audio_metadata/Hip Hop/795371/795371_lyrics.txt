Yeah, my pockets gotta be fed, hit the fuckin' cement
Gotta go for dollars, that's really my only reflex
Cash money's what the fuck I'm talkin'bout
You ain't tryin' to cough it up, what, you tryin' to stall me out?
Fuck that shit, I'll be passin'
Severely plottin' out how I'm'bout to catch you up
Bitch, I'm'bout to keep the glass full, not a half a cup
And I wouldn't be in business if the thing hadn't up
Stuff it in my jeans, pockets bussin' at the seams
Mug it for me,'cause mean muggin' back at me
And I'm off to get the scratch, I'll scrap it out and fight
Plus I know I'm not gonna ever blow up overnight
I'ma break big bread, chase this paper, make the next big step
I'll let them ladies get a taste of this thick head
Man my lifestyle'll change when I'm stiff sittin' dead
Till then, you should know that I'm all about my paper
Take money yeah, I'ma make you raise up
Heavy in the game, never gonna change up
And I was hungry way before I ever came up
You should know that I'm all about my paper
Take money, yeah, I'ma make you raise up
Heavy in the game, never gonna change up
And I was hungry way before I ever came up
Spit flames and I switch up
Nicknames need to cop an instrumental if you want that big bang
Big chips most chicks wanna give me big brain
Man I'm big with the beats and I'm big with the fame
Plus I most definitely got a lot to give
Can you copycat rappers stop mocking pocket big cause ya
It got me sick and I, I wanna vomit, yeah
Treat you like a man when you stop acting like a woman
Plus these, uh, fuckers act like they don't know what time it is
Generate the revenue, the profit gets pocketed
Spitting to my vocal cords, need another lozenjin
I'm gonna promise to get it popping up in your Providence
The prognosis is this kid's dominant
Swallow all your pride right down the esophagus
Cause ain't no stop to this, y'all be taking hostages
Battling with me is like leaping in a lava pit
You're not fit for this, I'm handing out certificates
So sit and listen,'cause you not quite gripping it (yeah, what?)
I'm a product of the dirty murder mitten, that's the Midwest (yeah)
Murder murder, Michigan (oh)
You should know that I'm all all all my paper (yeah)
Take money, yeah, I'ma make you raise up (oh)
Heavy in the gang, never gonna change up
And I was hungry way before I ever came here (oh)
You should know that I'm all all all my paper (yeah)
Take money, yeah, I'ma make you raise up (oh)
Heavy in the game, never gonna change up
If I was hungry, wait before I ever came up
I'm going corporate, it's sort of a legit route
Tougher to be sniffed out from the pig's snout
Yeah, I make sales, I ain't trying to pay for bills
But undercover cops gotta chase my paper trail
And that's what I'm about, from my hand to my mouth
Kiss the crack of my ass, I'll be glad to get out
Of the mitten, that dash, it's shit
Don't et it and you still won't understand
Why I keep grimming like
You should know that I'm all about my paper
Take money yeah I'ma make you raise up
Heavy in the game never gonna change up
And I was hungry way before I ever came up
You should know that I'm all about my paper
Take money yeah I'ma make you raise up
Heavy in the game never gonna change up
And I was hungry way before I ever came up
Yeah, yeah, yeah
