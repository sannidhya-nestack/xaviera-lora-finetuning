Yo, what up, y'all?
Sad song, you gonna hear what I got on it
Yo
Yo come the dawn
We gonna know where we went wrong
I said it all along in all my songs
It's like a chess game and we the pawns
On and on and on
But nothing ever changed
The world is deranged, fucking strange
A bunch of greedy brains causing pain
Everybody's strained for their own gain
And nobody repains
The money is fucking insane
We no longer know life's simple pleasures
The real treasures
We just go on getting exploited by fuckers like Walmart forever
They cashing in on their billions
While their employees and people living in this country in poverty number in the millions
Now that's fucking sad, yeah
Come the dawn
You'll be hearing us one song
We went so wrong
Now our future is gone
Come the dawn, come the dawn
Yo, hate to be so pessimistic about our future, y'all
But it just ain't looking good at all
There are times when the truth hurts more than a lie
But that's the time to look them motherfuckers in the eye
It's the way of the world, don't ask me why
Yo, that's how they win, they tell us lies
They pull the fuckin' wool right over our eyes
Get it again, the same alibis
No matter how hard we try, we just end up crying
Cause we're feeling powerless to stop their crimes
So who's gonna fight poverty, the poor?
Who's gonna stop AIDS, is there a cure?
How long can our planet endure?
The rich get richer, the poor get poorer
Death and taxes, the only thing that's sure
Come the dawn
You'll be hearing our small song
We went so wrong
Now our future is gone
Coming on, coming on
There's no use talkin'bout evolution
The only thing that saved us now is revolution
We'll take from the rich and give to the poor
Like Robin Hood, he knew the score
Just like in Matrix, we're fightin' a war
Us against the money machine
Fuckin' bastards, let's settle the score
Come the dawn
Come down, come down
Come down, come down
Come down, come down
