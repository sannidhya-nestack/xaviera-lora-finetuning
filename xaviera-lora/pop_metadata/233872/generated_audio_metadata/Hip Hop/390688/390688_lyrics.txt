All right, all right, all right (everything is everything, it's nice tonight)
Hey (everything is gonna be all right)
All right, all right, all right (everything is everything, it's nice tonight)
Come on 7-0 till then
Straight up, but a 575 for the west side then 9 double a one nine
Keep it alive and hot to the dick I die for the fact that I'm representing
Down to the footless, middle watch that ass like fresh out the county
Up with em and shit are getting creamed (can't lose everything)
For the way it is, better watch these suicidal situations
Caught up in the mix for six years without no permanent invocations
But I'm back in the mix with some of the type of shit like you can't touch this
Better read me lyrically, lyrically not you can't, uh
What I'm all about instead of putting it down from right to left
Not knowing if my last breath for the way things is most likely murder to death
For the fact nowadays shit is crazy after dark
Tripping up on some madness, somebody end up in the chalk
Tell me to get caught up with the walking dead since statistics
Tell me to get caught up with the fact I'm down with the ballistics
Simply for the fact I'm living life at a fast rate
No reason to wonder why
No doubt stood by this heaven, Seneca
Everything's gonna be alright (everything)
Tonight everything is everything
Tonight, tonight (tonight)
Everything's gonna be alright (hey)
Tonight everything is everything
Don't try to fix it if it ain't right for the ones that know or the ones that don't
Let it be known for the first or friend or fuck for the one known as the rose
Where the belief still to be hidden for the fact that drama's intense
Don't wanna get caught up simply for dollars and cents
Some of these deadly conditions try to make a living fuck prison visions of death
My rest I'm fought for iving listen simply what the way things is
Ain't no telling where the world's popping
For the fact niggas the same from the east to the west Brooklyn to Compton
No doubt about it talk lines got me broken hearted
So many times shed so many tears saw my daily departed nothing but love
Yeah what I went through got me filled with hatred no one to trust
For the way things is just a nigga tryna make you see we loc'd out
Toked out see we smoked out
No doubt
Living life at a fast rate no reason to wonder why
No doubt to the bottom 7's a nigga straight off of the rock
Everything is gonna be alright (everything) tonight
Everything is everything
Tonight's the night (tonight's the night) everything is gonna be alright
Tonight everything is everything
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Don't give up my brother
Don't give up my sister
Oh no
Listen my people
It's really very simple
You gotta take your time
Organize your mind
It's enough for you and me
A hundred and forty four C's
Organize your mind
