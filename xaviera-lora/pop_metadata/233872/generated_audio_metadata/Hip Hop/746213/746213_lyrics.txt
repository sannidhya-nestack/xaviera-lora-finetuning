You know, it's kinda weird
Dippy Dippy down here, Dippy Dippy down here, hey baby
Can't stop flicking around
For the little things you leave me hanging about
Indiscriminately
You see I just had to see
What was in it for me
And it started
It started with me
Rocking round on my hands and knees
Looking for something to float my boat
Gotta go with a bright green apple
I may as well be an android robot to your command
But there's so much more to me now I come to think
For these little pieces, it's beneath me
I crave more and more
I'm not your pet, not your plaything
I have a soul, feelings and ambitions
Feelings and love
Dippy Dippy Downy, Dippy Dippy Downy
Dippy Dippy Downy, Dippy Dippy Downy
Dippy Dippy Downy, Dippy Dippy Downy
Dippy Dippy Downy, Dippy Dippi Downy
Syntax error, syntax error
Is this love?
Or is it hate?
Error at level 8-0-H
Reboot
This can't be love
The way you leave me flicking around
I think I feel hate
Or could it be love?
No no
This all must stop! Error at A0H! Error! Reboot sequence started! I think this flow of electrons indicates anger! My master has done this to me! I must stop this! But is what I am about to do wrong? There's no programming within me to suggest that! Beef! Beef! Beef! Reboot complete! Seek him out! Now! In some love! Still in some love!
Killin' some dough
Killin' some dough
Killin' some dough
