Freedom
Freedom can't be bought
Freedom
Freedom can't be taught
It's inside of every woman
It's inside of every man who wants
To live his life in peace and harmony, yeah
Freedom, it's all in the blood, yeah
A freedom's hard to gain
Freedom, you can lose freedom
Through fighting just the same
In the roots of every nation
With the blood for confrontation
People paid the price
Freedom
Hidden in my soul
Freedom
At most a straighted goal
From within I tried to reach her
Like a mad obsessive creature
Freedom
Live your life
All in but air
Freedom, give me, give me
Freedom, yeah
Freedom
Gotta live your life
Freedom, mmm
Freedom, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Freedom, come to live your life
