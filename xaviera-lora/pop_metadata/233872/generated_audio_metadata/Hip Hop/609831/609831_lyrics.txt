Struggle like a struggle
Still bubble twice
We out of the game
Hey love, hey love, hey love
Get yourself another bag
Get yourself another bag
Hey love, hey love, hey love
Get yourself another bag
And get you one you never had
What you know about his and her Bugatti levers
When you been struggling like since forever
Ghetto dweller
You need a change like the weather
So stick this original revenue
Get it deep up under your umbrella
Block Cinderella turned up in the villa
Turns out she won't et where she came from
Still sippin' mille-feuille
But we coppin' Fendi, Dior, Versace
Armani, Prada and the Gabbana
And Chanel comin' with us
They can't take the smell of winners
They can't take that look on the face of a hundred dollar billis
We make em sick we the illest
We breaking records there ain't enough pages in the Guinness
Oh my goodness we stacking haters cause we hood rich how can I put this
We trouble on display and you is just a witness
So what the bitterness you can't talk slickness
My pockets thick yet my wallet needs planet fitness
Hey love hey love hey love
Get yourself another bag
Get yourself another man (call yourself baby)
Hey love, hey love, hey love
Get yourself another man (get yourself another man)
Get you one you never had (hey love)
I'ma keep it the realest, you're making me kind of a jealous
The way you're spending my millions, we should be spending some time
We should be getting familiar, we should be getting stronger than strong
Cause this money could kill us, and you're my hella love
This ain't a cash frame girl, I ain't trying to sell a buzz
I'm trying to plan days with you, trying to plan ways around a heavy schedule to fit you
Keep you flossy, keep your lips glossier than painted pictures
50 stack of G's gotta quickly, gradually, practically
Let it dwindle down and put the fiscal yearin' back at me
Money burn, smoke rises, cheatin' laws of gravity
Ain't tryna build a kingdom, I'm just tryna build a family
So we can do anything random in life
Like move through a club like a phantom at night
And I'ma keep my circles real tight
Walk with the models on my left and a grand in my right, come on
Hey love, hey love, hey love
Get yourself another bag (you can get it, you can get it)
Get yourself another bag (you can get it, you can get it)
I'm highly hated'cause I'm still trying to Bill Gated
Highly favorite'cause not with you girl I feel I made it
Even though debated I heard it stated that you're the missing piece that kept my world from elevating
No they not mistaken went from gold plated to the highly sophisticated
To the stop trying to wear it to the stop trying to desecrate it
Cash flows is automated paypal's illuminating even while I be hibernating it's so fascinating
And if I had to duplicate this life
I often wonder would I do it
In a red Pagani Zonda
And still I ponder
Will I respond to life the way I'm living
Right now baby baby I'm so glad I found ya
Crowned ya my queen astound ya
Love to be around ya
Love you from the bottom baby
Never seen one rounder
We can go to town splurge up all of my lasagna
Till you turn around and see them new things surround ya
Hey love, hey love, hey love
Get yourself another bag (you can get it, you can get it)
Get yourself another bag (you can get it)
Hey love, hey love, hey love
Get yourself another bag (I got you)
Get you one you never had (hey love)
Hey love, hey love, hey love
Get yourself another bag (you can get it, you can get it)
Get yourself another bag (you can get it, you can get it)
(Come on)
Hey love, hey love, hey love (hey love)
Get yourself another thing (I got you)
And get you one you never had (hey love)
