Kicking off the street in a place so fine
Where our hearts can beat together
The sun has gone away but here it's brightest day
In this spot we stay and not afraid
Here we'll gather close in the love we boast
Where we laugh at dreams but cry the most
To happy walls hold stories dear
Voices we can hear wipe away the fear
Shelter's always near windows let us see
Outside's mystery but with you and them and you and me
This is destiny
Here we'll gather close in the love we boast
Where we laugh the most, so happy
Getting off the street in a place so fine
Where our hearts can beat together
The sun has gone away but here it's brightest day
In this spot we stay and not afraid
Here we'll gather close in the love we boast
Where we laugh at dreams but cry the most
The happy walls hold stories dear
Voices we can hear wipe away the fear
Shelters always near windows let us see
Outside's mystery but with you and them and you and me
This is destiny
Here we'll gather close in the love we boast
Where we laugh the most, so happy
Gather close in the love we boast
When we laugh the dreams will cry the most
The happy walls hold stories here
Voices we can hear wipe away the fear
Shelters always near windows let us see
Outsides mystery but with you and them and you and me
This is destiny
Here we'll gather close in the love we boast
When we laugh the most so happy
