Mama she said keep it cold, keep it high, let it roll
Run don't stop, touch the sky, reach the top, feel it break it down
Break it down
Bounce bounce let it go
Make it high make it flow
Feel the strength in your soul never go go go move come patrol
Until the night,'til the dawn, keep it strong, dance away all your fears
Bounce, break it down
In the rhythm, find your spark, in the sound, leave a mark
Feel the bass through your feet, let the world feel your beat
Bounce, bounce, let it go
Make it high, make it flow
Feel the strength in your soul, never let go
Don't lose control
In the rhythm find your spark in the sound leave a mark
Feel the bass through your feet let the world feel your beat
Bounce house let it go make it high make it flow
Feel the strength in your soul never cold don't lose the control
Look at me
Bounce, I said, oh, make it high, make it flow (oh)
Feel the strength in your soul, never pull, oh, don't lose control (don't lose control)
Never lose control
Through the night'til the dawn, keep it strong, make it long
Pass away all your fears (bounce, make it)
In the middle find your spark in the sound
Leave a mark feel the bass through your feet
Let the world feel your beat
Oh make it count
Bounce bounce let it go
Make it high make it flow
Feel the strength in your soul
Never fall don't lose control
Lose control
Never lose control
Control, never lose control
