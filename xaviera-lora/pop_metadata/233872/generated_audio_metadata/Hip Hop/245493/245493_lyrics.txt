Oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh yeah, first time I saw you (I wanna be here with you)
I adore you (because I'm feeling with you)
Since then I've followed you
You will be the one for me baby
All night I longed for you (she went a slow dance)
Just couldn't ignore you (you went a slow trance)
Now I'll lead my life for you, I'll lead my life
My life's just started but it's time to leave the party, man
I wanna wrap around her waist like that cardigan
I wanna wrap around and taste what you orderin'
Face it, what you started, damn, I cannot support it and
My heart is so left and guarded, take me
You're a trip, I'm the boat that you chartered, baby
I'm your cactus, so fasten up and ride with me
Come sail the tides on USS Enterprise, skippy
First time I saw you (oh lord I can't get with you)
I adore you (because I've been in with you)
Since then I thought you
You would be the one for me baby
All night I longed for you (I thought you were the slow dance)
Just couldn't ignore you (thought you were the slow trance)
Now I'd leave my life for you
I would wait my life (as soon as I spotted you)
From across the room wanted a whole lot of you
I never lost the view
Had my eyes focused and my mind sharp because of you
Wasn't you the one from my dreams all I saw was you
Played hard to get when I first crept up to you
Across the room I let better bets, gifts coming through
I'm getting swept like a jet into the second sun
So I left my numbers, all my numbers but you left me none
All summer for you to come back across the country
Thought I lost the lovely one who wanted to love me
Thought you might have judged me for the way I came at you
Infatuated with you, pardon me I had to catch you cause the
First time I saw you
I adore you
Since then I thought you
You would be the one for me baby
All night I longed for you
Just couldn't ignore you
Now I'd wait my life for you
I would wait my life for you
Give me a call now
If you don't, I'm a fallin' after crown round
On my knees and cryin'
Dig her to the leaves and die
A whole nother life of love like this to arrive
But then it rings, it's your voice on the phone now
Hey baby it's me, what's goin' on now?
I'm in the zone now, baby girl it's so now
She's a goddess, honest, I'ma start this show now
And then the Genesis knew you was the gem I missed
Friendliness I reminisced on all summer long love lasted
Weathered it, spawned into a love so strong couldn't better it
Two veterans and a throughin' Armageddon
And we gettin' better than we ever did
Love strong Santa kid
Every time you hit me with a gentle kiss I'm tremblin'
Heart bending swingin' like a pendulum from ever since the
First time I saw you (I wanna kick it with you)
I adore you, since then I've bought you
You would be the one for me baby
All night I longed for you, just couldn't ignore you
Now I paid my life for you, oh oh
First time I saw you
I adore you (because I'm dating with you)
Since then I thought you
You would be the one for me baby
All night I longed for you (thought you were a slow dance)
Just couldn't ignore you (slept with you in a slow trance)
Now I wait my life for you
I'd wait my life, yeah (You oughta know what I'm doing, what I'm waiting for)
You oughta know when you're doing what I'm waiting on
And when it's on, give me all that I'm waiting for
Babe, I know you like me and I'm waiting for you
And when I wake, I just dream of you at night (I'd wait)
And when I dream, I still see you by my side (I'd wait)
