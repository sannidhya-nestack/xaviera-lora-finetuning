So I went to the store and what did I see?
A beautiful girl smiling at me
She was looking for love and affection
In the produce section
I saw her again in aisle three
Then she came right up to me
She said I'm looking for someone who is handy
By the way, my name is Mandy
I'm Johnny G
I can give you a hand
I can be your handyman
How about we meet for coffee or tea
Well let me check with my boyfriend if I can
But I just don't think that he'll understand
But don't you know who I am
I'm Johnny G the handyman
I'm the man who can
The man who can do it
I can take a screw and screw it
I got a lot of tools in my tool shed
Like a hammer drill and a chisel
I can have fun with my staple gun
Not gonna stop'til the job is done
I met Mandy for coffee and tea
Then she began to question me
She said, "I'm not sure what to do"
And why should I be with you?
I've got fortune and fame
Like Kanye West people know my name
I work out I'm fit you must admit
I've got a sexy body
I'm insanely in love with you
Let me tell you what a handyman can do
I can treat you right
I can hold you tight
I can keep you warm all through
Well let me check with my boyfriend if I can
But I just don't think that he'll understand
But don't you know who I am?
I'm Johnny G the Handyman
I'm the man who can, the man who can do it
I can take a screw and screw it
I got a lot of tools in my tool shed
Like a hammer drill and a chisel
I can fix a leak, I can patch a wall
Clean your gutters in the front yard
Well, let me check with my boyfriend if I can
But I just don't think that he'll understand
But don't you know who I am?
I'm Johnny G, the handyman
I've got the tools to please
I'll make you weak in the knees
I got a hot glue gun
I know we'll have fun
Rockin' the mic'til the song is done
But don't you know who I am? I'm Johnny G the Handyman
I make magic on this microphone I can do the same thing to your home
But don't you know who I am? I am Johnny G the Handyman
