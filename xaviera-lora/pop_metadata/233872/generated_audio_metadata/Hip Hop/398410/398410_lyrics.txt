Don't you judge those who try and fail
Why don't you ever judge those who fail to try
Though I try so very hard to understand
And I wonder why, why you wonder why
Why I be this way on judgment day
Y'all better believe I'm sick of the bullshit
Better be dealing with gonna make some bustas see some bullets
Slip of the finger on the trigger don't wanna make me pull it
Tell to be sick of the madness what to be doing make it a future like grip
I don't know why that's a sweet thing
I don't really understand what it is that's going on
Cause the bigger the propaganda
The never to know what's right from wrong
You wanna be real but know you never to deal with the real shit
You wanna be real gotta be yourself if ever to deal with this so on
Don't you judge those who try and fail
Why don't you ever judge those who
Fail to try though I try so very hard to understand
And I wonder why, why you wonder why, why I be this way on
Judgment day
Yeah better be number one on judgment day, it's on and it's like hallelujah
Hoppity boppity side of the clock, I shoulda been saying booyah kabooyah right dooyah
Yeah but it ain't no sleep for me, gotta carry on, gotta carry on
Even if it's over day, yeah better be four of them bustas think it's on another day
Better be thinking it's just another day, you see a dreadful day
A day that's filled up with so much misery, so why
When I'm, when I'm never to be giving it up and why
When I'm to the fullest, living the life of the chief, there's nothing in this world that can hold me
Life ain't complicated, only what you make it to be
What it is, just keep with people, until there's your presence
The consequence, better speak no evil, until there's your presence
No comments in, but it's just got facts and intentions
I mentioned you say don't bother until I be bossing and crushing your ass
Just like a pinata, you see, all I be doing is separate the facts from what's fiction
And keep it real to the fullest, that is my addiction
So don't you judge those who
Try and fail why don't you ever judge those who
Fail to try though I try so very hard to understand
And I wonder why why you wonder why why I be this way on
Judgment
What it is that's going in with society, but they ain't worried about them CEOs
They talking about the root of us, so we use it, it is a no-no
Non-morpally, sputality, malary, salary, this no analogy
Families matter, me mentality is fatality
I really don't understand what it is that's going in nowadays
I really don't understand, but judgement day will make it clear
Fuck that, gotta walk out of my pants up to stretch what you don't really know
You don't hear me though, and that is just the way it goes so
So, so, don't you judge those who
Try and fail, why don't you ever judge those who fail to try?
And I wonder why, why you wonder why, why I be this way young?
Don't you judge those who try and fail
Why don't you ever judge those who fail to try
And I wonder why, why you wonder why, why I am this way
Don't you judge those who try and fail
Why don't you ever judge those who fail to try?
Judgment day
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
