Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, aayy (Hey!)
The way she move it (the way she move it)
The sexy feeling (the sexy feeling)
Just rock this party (rock this party)
Girl move your body (girl move your body)
Hey!
Hold up (hold up)
Wait a minute (wait a minute)
Let me put some people (let me put some people)
One by one, two by two, I got them girls, them actin' full
Put it up, put it down, girls dem a whine
Left to right, men pass me a wine
Black one, white one, pussy not tight
Give me a dike, I'm a make, I'm a wife
Wish you moving
The sexy feeling
Just rock this party
Girl move your body, hey
The way she moving
The sexy feeling
Just rock this party
Girl move your body, hey
Stepped in the party, eyes all low, you's the first thing I saw whining so slow
You impressed me, take my hand, escort me to the back of the club
Now one, two, rip the downside, your booty got the question, my dick got the answer
Your man wild out, then my gun go block her
Hold her, let me wild with my niggas, relax no beef
See that broad grab her, niggas wonder why we got six swagger
Take her to the floor, make sure she don't flex you
Maybe I might sex you, until then just rock this party
Girl go ahead and move your body
Until then just rock this party
Girl go ahead and move your body
When she moving, the sexy feeling
Just rock this party, girl move your body, hey!
When she moving, the sexy feeling
Just rock this party, girl move your body, hey!
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ay, ayy
The way she move it
The sexy feeling
Just rock this party
Girl move your body, hey
The way she move it
The sexy feeling
Just rock this party
Girl move your body, hey
