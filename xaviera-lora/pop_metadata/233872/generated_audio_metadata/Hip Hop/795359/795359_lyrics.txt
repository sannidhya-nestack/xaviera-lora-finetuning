Trying to kick it I'm just following the paper
Plus I never play the background
So don't try to act out
T cash if we clash
You ain't about to back out
Breaking heads, taking names
F***ing you off with nothing to gain
Pay my dues I'm stuck in the game
Ain't nothing to change ain't nothing to change
Trying to kick this lower class
Keep a steady flow of cash
It ain't no going broke no more
Cause cones just ain't gon' go for that
Keep my pockets overstacked
It ain't gon' be no holding back
I can't let up I won't break down
I'm way too f***ing grown for that
Ain't no sitting patient waiting in the same location
Just praying for some label to pick me up and just be gracious
Oh f*** that am I anxious, antagonistic prickin
Ain't working out for me if I ain't stacking up chips
I got to make money, break bread, take money, make moves, make sure the cash flow
Like it do, I got to make money, break bread, take money, make moves, make sure the cash flow
Like it do
I done seen twenty dollars show the trace and I'm burning
Cheese is a must dog I'm brave and determined
I see niggas get murked for fifteen hundred dollars
To me that's Hawaii or a trip to the Bahamas
The money more important than sleep
We at war with a beast but who gives a fuck as long as we eat
It's a hundred differences between the strong and the weak
And I can have about three hundred bricks gone in a week
I'm just drunk thinking about from all the bounce tweaking out
The streets got me freaking out speak what you about
Okay okay okay
Put the peace up in your mouth for not having the right amount
Wired to my bank account I make money break bread
Stay hungry shake feds praying on these base heads
But you are the safe act
Lay you out where you pray at
I don't give a fuck if it's out of town where you stay at
I got to make money break bread
Take money make moves make sure the cash flow
Like it do I got to make money break bread
Take money make moves make sure the cash flow
Like it do I got to make money break bread
Take money, make moves, make sure the cash flow
Like it do, I got to make money, break bread
Take money, make moves, make sure the cash flow
Like it do
Yo, I never got a school scholar
Didn't wanna do college
Love clubs, pubs and parlors
Goin' after young daughters
Over 21, come holla
Love me for my love of dollars
Every thirty seconds
Brain projectin' ways to sell product
Pocket all the profits
Plot plans to make it come quicker
Double up, re-up and flip it
Fucking with no funny business
Steady 9 to 5
Work a hustle on the side
Incognito on the D-low
Be the steelo when I grind
Self discipline
Persistent with prevent myself from slipping
Work ethic be equivalent to a poor foreign immigrant
Addicted to the business
They stripped me of my innocence
Ever since I was a teen I was doing breaking in the wrench
Shaking dice and gambling breaking dimes and bagging'em
Anything I could to gain my saddle up and straddling
No chit chat no babbling my actions due to dazzling
When you see me in that 740 beaming with the plasma lens
Sitting in the back seat sexing with a bad freak
Spread up on my lap easing my d*** between the a** cheeks
Indeed I'm that indecent I ain't trying to be discreet
I act a clown with my paper I work hard to get my cheese
Money make moves make sure the cash flow
Like it do I got to make money break bread
Take money make moves make sure the cash flow
Like it do I got to make money break bread
Take money make moves make sure the cash flow
Like it do I got to make money break bread
Take money make moves make sure the cash flow
