That hush in the hallway, stir in my mind
Hopes turn to whispers so easy to find
Blurring illusions, I chase what you gave
Reading intentions, no words left to save
You twist the storyline paint me in grey
Calling out signals then watch them decay
I measure your pulses I'm mapping each phase
Leaning on confidence can't be erased
Trapped in the crossfire breathing in slow
Your melody haunts me but I'm letting it go
Clinging to visions that never align
Now I'm slipping your leash reclaiming my mind
Dripping in truth no veil can disguise
Echo in my chest a beat so alive
Driven in truth, I rise in your eyes
Feel the effect, nothing left to revise
You tested my pride, it never withdrew
Trying to hush me but I'm tough to subdue
Whispers once golden now colder than frost
I'm charting new chapters, new pages lost
Don't lock me in doubt, regrets turn to dust
Trust in my voice now,'cause trust is a must
I lock in my clarity, e in my way
No illusions remain, I'm done trying to play
Drippin' in truth, you can't wash it out
Drippin' in truth, it's the pulse that's devout
Drippin' in truth, still the sound I feel
Drippin' in truth, this is how I heal
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dripping in truth
Still the sound I feel
Dripping truth
This is how I heal
