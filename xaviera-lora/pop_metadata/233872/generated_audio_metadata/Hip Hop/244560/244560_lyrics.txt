This ain't no love song, this ain't no club song
But kiss your girl and go get your buzz on
Ain't got a car to say I got dubs on
So I guess that this is a scrub song
I say it proud, you best to call me Scotch Brite
Cause on my bike is how I hit the block right
Not a flashy type, shed light with a hot mic
Just say ooh yeah, we hit the spotlight
Moving to the music, shit I can't resist
Moving through my blood and from the pen it drips
In the wind, in this biz, I spit to get respect
In effect, and I bet you never guessed it
Three MC's with a different perspective
One DJ check phonics on the records
PH maintains all efforts collective
Studio to show y'all now we're gonna wreck it
Wreck it, wreck it, wreck it, wreck it
Moving to the music, shit I can't resist
Yes, ooh, yes, ooh, yes, ooh
Yes, ooh, yes, ooh
Chess, ooh, chess
Ooh yeah you should be concerned with this
What do you get if you don't learn to give
Nothing in return that's affirmative
First thing to note don't burn a bridge
Connect both sides make alternatives
That's for liberals and conservatives
If you support the war you don't deserve to live
I'd give my life if you'd return the gift
This is who, yes, not, hell no, my word you feel, they bump like braille flows
Ain't gotta see'em to believe'em, what I write is what they're bleedin'
Cost it changed like the seasons for no apparent reasons (yes)
This is the pleasure after pain, this is the sun after rain
Rain, rain, just let it rain
Don't you know that
It's, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
We break out the surface coming out the sound cellar
It's raining hip hop go grab your umbrella
If hip hop's dead someone ot to tell her
The smell of salt came alive and woke her up
She looked out the world and said what the fuck
She was never dead so can't be resurrected
She's always gonna be here so accept it
So accept it so accept it
Yes
Ooh yes, ooh yes, ooh yes, ooh yes
