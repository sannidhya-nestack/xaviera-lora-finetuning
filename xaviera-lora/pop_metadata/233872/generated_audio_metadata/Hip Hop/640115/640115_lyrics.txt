Come on boys and girls alike, listen to the beat bump at night
Neighborhoods, surrounding areas, barrios, under one male
All those in jail, even the ones who pushed that yayo
Bush and quail, all the people that ot hip hop is real
Yo here's the deal, open your ear drums hear what's real
Now you can heal, the circle of words cure ill feel
I fit the bill
A dope MC when you put him on a beat give heat to them
Any BPM I drop shit rhyme PBM
Treat him on a holiday rhyme all the way
Hanukkah Ramadan make the girls ache
Single with the day down mingle with the backside
Let the wax slide when I have my way
I remember the days
We made A tapes from crates in the basement
It was amazing
Nothing bout ice, we tryna get it right
I'm gonna get the mic and state my mind
Can you visualize what the rhyme?
Make the art form come alive
Very animated when I'm getting in the vibe
I'm gonna get mine, I'm not gonna lie
But on the way might take my time
Gonna do it my way, hold the highway
Take that hype to Lakeshore Drive
Rock it, rock it, roll with some nerfing and clapping, hold on, I'm drinking some beer, repeat the message
All the people lost, break it down until it's gone, lost and out and now we're something, I'm building'em, get them jumping, now we got the sound
Rock it, rock it, roll with some nerfin' and clapping, hold on, I'm drinking some beer, repeat the message
All the people lost, break it down until it's gone, lost and out and now we're something, I'm building'em, get them jumping, now we got the sound
We made contact with the back and the front
Everyone in the club can get what they want
Now I can get the whole thing started
Grab another brew, turn on a groove
Everybody shake it at the dance party
Know how we do, body rock crew
Buddy got a brand new tune to market
Talk about the group in the interview
Now lethargic in the art department
Making beats in the dark apartment
Spark the earth
But let's throw down that baseline first
We're gonna make it heavy like the waistline hurts
Been ready with the flow since my own birth
For old earth, even the dirt
Make it all worth, benefits, perks
Kinda like taking a paid vacation
Feels great to get away from the same shit
Lame old silly old radio videos
Gotta be kidding, it's hip-hop pigeonhole
So pitiful and minimal
We wanna hit'em all like a centipole
Bring it all back like rapping tone
Sit back, relax, let's get grown
I get rock and roll with some nerfing and clashing, go down on three and simply repeat the message, all the people must break it down until it's nothing, I'll stay out an hour some time, I'm building up, get them jumping, now we got the sound (shout it out)

What's the basis? Fake generation? Make it the same? Fold the bank statement? Turn that station? Practically racist? Hip-hop? That's waxploitation
Go paper chase man, ay, to each his own but you just ate
Wanna get back man, take that last track back to the man that had that made
Some say, "Yo don't hate this"
I say just don't waste it
Don't play or get up in the face kid
Might go bananas then ape shit
Rondeboot loose in the booth
I'll make another record and I'm back to the zoo
What you gonna do show improve
Believe me dude that ain't you
All I wanna do get people in the crew
Beat up on a dude
Read him with a new cool boo
With a boom you ask who
All stride down, beat down like Goose
I'm used to the blues
Hot crews that do amuse you
They might contuse or confuse you
We do it just for show
Much love for the microphone, yo
We build our skill and watch it grow
We got you rockin' too
And throwin', poppin', lockin' like ozone
Do you wanna make it all the way home
Where people can listen and give it their all?
Hear a message, make a movement
Make an impression, take a direction
Love the next man, levitate mind soul reflection
And let me know
Negative energy, elevate melody, enemy better be ready for peace in here
Rampis gotta beat this year, or we could do it on leap year
No money get free in here, like my delivery pizza's here
