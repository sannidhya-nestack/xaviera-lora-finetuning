You can call me Farrah Khan
I don't die for my race
I don't die just because my pride
We like 300 deep
Fingers tip straight to the sky
You got your arm around my neck
Leave me low like trying to die
I ain't selling no crackers
I ain't selling no homicide, all right, all right for my people
I'll buy all y'all guys for my people
To the sky looking down with my people
I gotta march black past all my people
I can't breed black wrong people, listen up
Your boy living through me, give me a cigarette
He wasn't selling no weed, this ain't no dividend
He had family beef, justice in the making
I know they feeling me three beats
They won't walk, we can humbly be
Bet you four to one million, my state is a beast
Never scared so I'm twenty three follow me G
Watch Supreme take off the sheet another million mad march out in D .C.
I dwell in the house G .O .D. they wanna lock me up and throw a weight on y'all kids
They call me Farrakhan
I don't die for my race I don't die just because of my pride
We like three hundred deep fingertips straight to the sky
You got your arm on my neck leave me low like trying to die
I ain't selling no crack I ain't selling no homicide
Got something for the ones in the blues that are bullish
Automatic feelings, 17 deep in, all black hoodies
Rolling up goodies, eye for an eye
If you catch a body I can tell you where to put it
La policia, think I did the meekest us
Think I pushed bass to the speaker bus
But it's illegal you, naive with us
My freedom is heaven as an eagle tough
Every good micro, travel to Freddie, that's more just like you
To cover to fight you, they don't know you, but they just like you
Yeah, my pace is short and my barrel long
Retaliation blowing like a baritone
Have a dirty cop running like a marathon
It's hard, I ain't gas like Chevrolet
I don't die for my race, I don't die, you become my pride
We like 300 deep, fingertips straight to the sky
You got your arm around my neck, leave me alone like trying to die
I ain't selling no crack, I ain't selling no homicide
How bout the palm lightning, palm lightning
Tryna do it too much so take your cape off
All in uniform tryna knock her face off
And you wonder how you get the whole case off
Straight boss warm bout to lace you off
And society sucks don't take a day off
Point name with the Glock tryna erase her off
And it think they run straight to the graveyard
Cause a hitter a killer
How you figure my hitter did you assemble these hitters
Did you dismember these hitters
I'm defending these hitters
To the weakest of hitters up to the Indian hitters
Tryna take what we built you little Indian give us when you ain't gave nothing
Still slaves to the mind they ain't change nothing
Real rapper man cool but a days coming
Retaliate I ain't standing at your great stunt
You can call me Farrakhan
I don't die for my race, I don't die just because my pride
We like 300 deep fingertips straight to the sky
You got your arm around my neck leave me long like trying to die
I ain't selling no crack, I ain't selling no homicide
So what's the reason for the disrespect?
One way or another we gon' put it in check for a flex
Eight shots to the back with no regrets
Let's talk about murder guess who's next
Everything you strove through my hood
You the mother fucker up to no good
All sin is destruction you don't want peace
Pac made it clear stand on our own feet
And don't believe in everything you see
It's a trap you against me
Thought I'd walk through the valley
I should not feel dead if it comes from me
But I'm back where incarnated
Not for everything she gon' pay me
You can call me Farrakhan
I don't die for my race
I don't die just because my pride
We like 300 deep fingertips straight to the sky
You got your arm around my neck
Leave me low like trying to die
I ain't selling no crack
I ain't selling no homicide
