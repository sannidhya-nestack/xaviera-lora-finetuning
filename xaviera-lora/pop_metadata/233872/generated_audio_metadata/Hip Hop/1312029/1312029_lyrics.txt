Steppin' in the zone, feelin' fresh as can be
Music floodin', thoughts sparkin' synergy
No time for the trivial, keep it carefree
Confidence steady, that's the lockin' key
Airwave sparks, I'm ridin' that flow
Beat on repeat, it won't let me go
Heart engaged, it's all I know
Airwave sparks, let the rhythm show
Crew in my corner, we share every bar
Combos lightin' up, no sign of a scar
No gloom in sight, clarity near and far
This synergy hums, no need to spar
Airwave sparks, I'm ridin' that flow
Beat on repeat, it won't let me go
Hard engaged, it's all I know
Airwave sparks, let the rhythm show
I cling to this spark, it keeps me alive
Leading each step, fueling my drive
Airwave sparks, I'm letting it in
Mind wide open, ready to begin
Locked to the vibe, I'm wearing this grin
Airwave sparks, I'm destined to win
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Crew in my corner, we share every bar
Convos lightin' up, no sign of a scar
No gloom in sight, clarity near and far
This synergy hums, no need to spar
I cling to this spark
It keeps me alive
Leading each step
Fuelin' my drive
Airwave sparks I'm letting it in
Mind wide open ready to begin
Locked to the vibe I'm wearing this grin
Airwave sparks I'm destined to win
