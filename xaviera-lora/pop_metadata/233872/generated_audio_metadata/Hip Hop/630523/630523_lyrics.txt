Girl, I'm not the best at wasting time
Make the best out of opportunities, especially'cause you're so fine
Meet me by the dance floor
et about the exit door
Nobody leaving'til we do what we came for
And you know how we do
Como esta my latin boo
I wanna be alone with you
VIP with room just for two
Mommy me and you
Six in the morning moon and rolling
That's what lovers do baby
I'm where I am with a million fans
Including you and him and your other man
Gotta lose them both
Understand, three is company, you, me, rubber band
Throwback circumstance, sippin' zay
Off the branches in France, erday
Grown in sexy status, celebrate
Touchin' Canada, Panama, Montego Bay
Me and you in the backseat, ask me
I we more than just relaxin', gettin' nasty
Fully dressed exactly, my knees too ashy
So I'ma let her throw it at me, tell me
So what you workin' with, what you twerkin' with
What you workin' with, what you twerking with
Throw it to the side baby, put a little dirt in it
In a skirt in it, twerkin' it, workin' it (Why you don't have to)
Flirt, flirt, flirt (Baby you don't have to)
Flirt, flirt, flirt (Girl you don't have to)
Work that flirt (Mama you don't have to)
Flirt, flirt, flirt (All you need to do is)
Twerk, twerk, twerk
Baby won't you twerk, twerk, twerk
Show me how you twerk, twerk, twerk
Mama won't you twerk, twerk, twerk
Sweet lady I can't figure out
How you walked in all alone
But some way somehow
Tonight I plan to take you home
You deserve a man that's grown and strong enough to really put you on
I got everything you need even though girl you can't hold your own
Something inside of me is heavy and my heart won't stop cause I know it's working
Some tell me no some tell me yes I don't really stress cause I know it's working
Something inside of me is heavy and my heart won't stop cause I know it's working
Some tell me yes, some tell me no
Some tell me I just gotta blame it on the twerking
That's why you don't have to twerk, twerk, twerk
Baby you don't have to twerk, twerk twerk
Girl you don't have to twerk, twerk twerk
Mama you don't have to twerk, twerk twerk
All you need to do is twerk, twerk, twerk
Baby won't you twerk, twerk, twerk
Show me how you twerk, twerk, twerk
Mama won't you twerk, twerk, twerk
Da da da da da da, da da da da da, da da da da, oh baby
Da da da da da da, da da da da da, da da da da
Swag, you don't have to work (flirt, flirt, flirt)
Baby, you don't have to work (flirt-flirt-flirt)
Girl, you don't have to work that (flirt-flirt-flirt)
Mama, you don't have to work (flirt-flirt-flirt)
All you need to do is work (twerk, twerk, twerk)
Baby, won't you work (twerk, twerk, twerk)
Show me how you twerk, twerk, twerk
Mama won't you twerk, twerk, twerk
Why you don't have to lurk, lurk, lurk
Baby you don't have to lurk, lurk lurk
Girl you don't have to lurk that, lurk lurk
Mama you don't have to lurk, lurk lurk lurk
All you need to do is twerk, twerk, twerk

Mama won't you twerk, twerk, twerk
