Set this thing off, set it off light (that's right)
Like this, rockets (all day every day)
Seven, I got your back (tell me where we gonna be, tell me where we gonna be)
With the way that things is going down
For the way the hit goes, puffing no madness
My last breath of breath and all hope provoked
So many dying, moms steady crying
Caught up with the way society is, what am I died crying
No reason to wonder why somebody out for the hustle
From the beginning death to the end of time
It's all about the struggle, what this troubled world brings
Pain, eternal flames and shame
Dirty games, save me from a nerdy grave
Three strikes, you're out like life, some sort of a ball game
As always, programmed every day and all day
Facing daily confrontations, heavy situations
For the fact what's yours is yours and mine is mine
Mama told me that I would've mopped up to nothing without cause
Lost against the world, try to make it against all odds
Up on rough waters and on shaky ground
What's going down?
With the way that things is going
Tell me where we gonna be
Tell me where we gonna be
For the way that things is going (Tell me where we gonna be)
(Tell me where we gonna be) (What, what, what)
Better be doing the fuck you must by any means necessary
For the way that things is, for the way that things is going down
Life is all about getting major pays, see me in your world
Yet still the chain remains, the game remains the same
Jealousy and greed, vividly picture my misery
Healing needs, steady's keeping the habit away, still obey the drummer
But I'm addicted to the fast life, that's right
So many visions of prison, suffering is un iving
Losing my religion for the fact I'm trying to make a living
Listen, for the east or the west, no doubt it's all the same
Girls like a playboy page and boys like John Wayne
Feel me?
With the way that things is going on
With the way society is, who's to say what's right from wrong?
Up on rough waters and on shaky ground
What's going down?
With the way that things is going
Tell me where we gonna be
Tell me where we gonna be
With the way that things is going, tell me where we gonna be
Tell me where we gonna be, yeah
But it comes down to it there's only one life to live
Keeping heat with me frequently that's just the way it is
No time for asking why I'm on a mission of getting mine
Mission try to make a living and mission of getting by
Better watch your dangerous liaisons of fatal attractions
Serving with a daily dose of the real fuck how you feel
See yesterday's a memory tomorrow's a dream
Reality check let life ain't what it seems still
Keep your eyes on the prize though under pressure
And hope for the better, taking no drastic measures
Of cause and effect, regrets, never et the stress
Nothing less than the best to expect, for what it's worth
Paying my dues, counting blues, playing the ruse
Never confused in my shoes, up on rough waters and on shaky ground
But the way that things is going (tell me where we gonna be)
(Tell me where we gonna be)
But the way that things is going (tell where we gonna be)
Tell me where we gonna be
What a way that things is going
Tell me where we gonna be
Tell me where we gonna be
