I swear, I swear, I swear, I swear that I'll be anything, anything you want
Nonbelievers telling me I'm dope, yeah I know, I know
I ain't never questioning it bitch, I told you so
Now you wanna celebrate the show, just post a photo of you
Yeah, I don't give a fuck about who fake who not
I don't give a fuck about those likes you bought
I don't give a fuck about your brand new car
Nobody knows that I'm dope you not
All my other homies left my goddamn side
I'm just killing shit solo, saying more ride
I just made like 25 fucking tiktoks
Bitches on my dick but I still tell them kick right
Kick rock just like I met that last bitch over fucker
What got them into a mental asylum?
How can she be sucker with an IM?
Make that bitch wet then I turn into a shipwreck
Guess that explains why I'm over ball
Cause I'm doing this shit till I overdose
And I get that grind from the overload
When I blow like vote and I go for broke
Get it gold, get it, get it gold
It's that super psycho mode screaming run, run, run
Get it gold, get it, get it, get it gold
It's that bitch I told you so screaming I told you so
I swear that I'll be
Anything, anything you want
Nonbelievers telling me I'm dope
Yeah I know, I know
I ain't never questioning it bitch
I told you so
Now you wanna celebrate for sure
Just post like a photo
Who the damn you hatin'?
Talkin' that gang gang gang
You on my side, you fakin'
With me like bang bang bang uh
Fuck up my face, AKA, when I'm gon' pull up with the AK
And I'm gon' point aim, point blank, and you gon' cry, "Wait, wait, wait"
I'm just joking, I don't got a gun
But I might get one, that would be fun
I am so happy like my trigger finger
Two for the pussy and one for the stinker
Talk of that shit but that shit never linger
Don't got the vision, they too busy blinkin'
Pop a prescription, I promise I quit it
So I did it bitch, fuck that shit
Fuck that fender man, fuck that itch
Fuck that fella when you need some more
I did that shit then I flipped that script
Now I sell crack cause my shit too dope
Telling me she love me I think she lying
Get on the flow this is a riot
My thoughts turn to end the fucking cybers
Hold up I'm already this is my highest
I just get gold get it get it get it gold
It's that super psycho mode screaming
I told you so
Get it gold get it get it get it gold
It's that bitch I told you so screaming
I told you so
I swear that I beat
Anything, anything you want
Nonbelievers telling me I'm dope
Yeah I know, I know
I ain't never questioning it bitch
I told you so
Now you wanna celebrate for sure
Just post like a photo
