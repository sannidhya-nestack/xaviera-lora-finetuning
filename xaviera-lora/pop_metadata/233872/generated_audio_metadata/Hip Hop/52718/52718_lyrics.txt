Driving in my car in the middle of the day
Finished with my work now it's time to play
Been a long hard day cause I'm thinking about your love
Can't live without now I'm out on the road doing 80
Jammin' to the hippie I'll jump like a hattie
Drop top down on the song
Make it a little trip to see my number one hun
Do what you do
I like the way you do it
Driving, driving, be wild all the time
I got the rhythm, you got the rhyme
Driving, driving, be wild every day
I got the will, you got the way
Got it in my car in the middle of the night
Cop pulled me up and started reading the riot
So I looked right at him said wish I could hang
But that'll put me late, I got a dang minute for my date
A trade mate, a hot little swamp fox taking the bait
So the cop gave in cause he had a look
He had seen it all before and he knew exactly what I took
Do what you do, I like the way you do it
Driving, driving, speed world, all the time
I got the rhythm, you got the rhyme
Driving, driving, speed world, every day
I got the will and you got the way
You got the way
You got the way
I got the rhythm you got the rhyme
Take my time
Lose my mind
Going down with a lyrical jam
So deaf you got to say "Damn"
Smooth like a razor to the microphone
Cut through like static on your telephone
Listen to the lyrical master
Blasting on the scene and creating a disaster
Boom, right on cue
Before you know it I've bought and sold you
Driving, driving, being wild all the time
I got the rhythm, you got the rhyme
Driving, driving, being wild every day
I got the will and you got the way
Driving, driving, being wild all the time
I got the rhythm, you got the rhyme
Driving, driving, being wild every day
I got the will and you got the way
Driving, driving insane
