I remember man, just being young
Just hanging out and really just, just being cool
I remember when, ay, say I remember when, ay
Say I remember when, when life was so simple, yeah
When life was so simple (I remember when, ay)
Say I remember when, ay
Say I remember when, when life was so simple, yeah
When life was so simple (I remember being just another youngin' on the block)
After school daily practice in my jump shot
Coppin' magazines every time another drop
Studying all of the players wishin' I could be on top
With my top down, straight cruisin'
Down in the bay
All my homies Hispanic
I'm watching for what they say
Mama watch after me
From the window when I would play
And I'm still doing me to this day
Okay got me a crew
They show me around the locale
Running around the sundown
Like what now
Bike riding my pedals
Take it to other levels
I ain't even notice we was in the ghetto
Hello my name
Stickers on my shirt
Doing class work
Seven years old
Trying to figure out some bad words
Shorty right behind me
Talking crazy learning faster
I couldn't speak
Cause I didn't know that password
I remember when
I say I remember when, I say I remember when
When life was so simple, yeah, when life was so simple (I remember when, I say I remember when, I say I remember when)
When life was so simple, yeah, when life
Don't stand for being just another youngin' on the block
After school daily practice in my jump shot
Copping magazines every time another drop
Studying all of the players wishing I could be on top
But my homie got locked, another got popped
We only thirteen, tell me when it's gon' stop
Little did we know hey
It was only getting started
Police looking at me like a target
Learned to do less talking in the street now
It's beef now
Run your mouth and catch a beat down
It ain't sweet now
Did I mention that we in the A
Look in the corner at my mom and she begin to pray
Another day another problem eh
Now tell me how we gon solve em eh
Got with my homies A from Harlem eh
We riding out by the carload eh
And I remember when, ay, say I remember when, ay
Say I remember when, when life was so simple, yeah
When life was so simple (I remember when, ay)
Say I remember when, ay (yeah) say I remember when
Never would have imagined when life was so simple
When life was so simple
Me and Justin at the Youngin on the block
After school daily practice in my jump shot
By now I graduated and my homies done stopped
Boy it's all about the streets since you rolling out of now
And I'd rather make a song expressing my pain
Ain't really did too much wrong in all of my days
I seen too many and my brothers get stuck in the game
And I done met too many women that's learning my name
And give it away now
Rocking the stage with my shades on I be trippin
Parties with ladies on the daily tell me how you living
Cause I'm just tryna make a way to get paid
And live a dream for my people in the grave
Not a bad decision
God please show me the road
Where should I go
I'm in territory my eyes never seen before
Ready for gold by the rainbow
Rapping the crowds are only seen at a trade show
Say I remember when, I say I remember when
When life was so simple, yeah, when life was so simple (I remember when, I say I remember when)
Yeah, I say I remember when (when life was so simple, yeah) yeah (when life was so simple)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Say I remember when, when life was so simple, yeah
When life was so simple
