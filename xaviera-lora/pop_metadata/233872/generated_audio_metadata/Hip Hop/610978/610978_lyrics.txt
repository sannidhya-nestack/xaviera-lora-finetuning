Uh, uh, just try and get, I swear we try and get
Yo, that's that shit man, I play it
Ay yo, the weekend just came and we try and get wasted
Try and get wasted, try and get wasted
The vibe is so dead man you better not waste it
Let's get wasted, let's all get wasted
Don't hold me's hand so this all get wasted
They broke some honey so this all get wasted
Wasted, wasted, finna get wasted
Wasted, wasted, go and get wasted
Couple beer kegs, that'll drown the perks
Shots of Jamison, that'll drown the vikes
Jager bombs next
I'm beyond nice
Me and the frat bros chillin we just loungin perks
Friday night and you only live one time
Weekend is here and you only live one time
YOLO YOLO drinking with my bros though
Party started yesterday ends when I don't know though
This ain't no Soho
Party in the backyard, everybody regular
We don't care about stars
This ain't broadway party by the campfire
Great memories, me and the whole fam wired
Get hammered, drink the beer and flip the cup
Aim the pong ball shoot, better not miss the cup
Either way we all winners, back to the basics
Ain't here to act up, just came to get wailed
Ay yo, the weekend just came and we tryna get wasted
Try and get wasted, try and get wasted
The vibe is so there and you better not waste it
Let's get wasted, let's all get wasted
The homies here so let's all get wasted
They broke some honey so let's all get wasted
Wasted, wasted, finna get wasted
I said, waste, wasted, go and get wasted
Fuel bongs lit, couple cans of beer
Take a few shots, we do not care
Shotgun a brew, I meant you too
Something to do when there's nothing to do
Saturday night, we just living for the moment
Never neglected, nah gotta own it
We on it, on it, whatever you can say
Think of, we hang out with our wings out
Plus black and now this what we on the brink of
Naw this ain't Hollywood, everybody simple
Surrounded by gnarly hoes
Naw this ain't 5th Ave, and all the big cash
Chasing down the joints that give every dude whiplash
Get hammered, drink the beer and flip the cup
Aim the pong ball, shoot, better not miss the cup
Either way we all winners, back to the basics
Ain't here to act up, just came to give
Hey yo, the weekend just came and we tryna get wasted
Tryna get wasted, tryna get wasted
The vibe is so there and you better not waste it
Let's get wasted, let's all get wasted
The homies here so let's all get wasted
They brought some honey so let's all get wasted
Wasted, wasted, finna get wasted
Wasted, wasted, go and get wasted
Damn, killing done
Damn, this shit is giving me a hangover
Yeah, I'm wasted
I hate being sober
Damn, damn, yo
Look at that shorty over there
She fly, she is crazy
I don't know what I'ma do
Somebody please give me some more licks
Yo, pass that Dutch B
Niggas is smack man
Yo, I'm really on way over to hangover tomorrow though
Shit gone be crazy
Aye yo, the weekend just came and we tryna get wasted
Tryna get wasted, tryna get wasted
The vibe is so there and you better not waste it
Let's get wasted, let's all get wasted
The homies here so let's all get wasted
They broke some honey so let's all get wasted
Wasted, wasted, finna get wasted
Wasted, wasted, go and get wasted
