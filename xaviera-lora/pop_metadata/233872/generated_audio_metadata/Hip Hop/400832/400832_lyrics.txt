Some say I took you for granted, it didn't happen like that
People have to adapt to combat, it's what it is
You live or die, your liver's dry
ive or et to live, so I'll die trying
I live in the moment of my choosing
Like protozoa flow on Krakatoa Mount Fuji
Blew all her fuses last Tuesday
Still bruised where I abused pneumatic tubes
I'm ugly on the inside
On the outside
I keep my mouth wide open
And my mind wired shut
I hope the wind finds fire women
To conspire with viable spirals
A new regime will wash a noodle clean
With antihistamine
Can I twist up some greens and sweet dreams
Sweet pea you speak to me
When I peek a boo with you
Cerulean blue and beautiful in bamboo shoots
A national glampoon moon boost
Let's blast off and slingshot until our wings get hot, get hot
Who can hit me again, girl, do what you like
At the door, don't ever come back
I won't try to stop you, you're just in my way, you're a fool anyway
Got her mind wired from a tire material girl
Wanted to be what the world concocted for commercial
Profitable image of her mistress in the kitchen
A model so skinny she wobbles from malnutrition
A gimmick her standard vision of big sticks
No hips do away with 8 cups
Put on your makeup
Pay to be ageless to push your face up
Wake'em up before we sleepin' next to replicas
Does a man want a mannequin or an animal damsel?
Would you trade for a geisha?
Rather have a companion who can handle all your man baggage and still embrace ya
No takers you won't face it
The fact of matter then it's wasted
Go chase it in slow paces
False predication and delusional men
The show is so chauvinistic you're sick in the head
God a lot in bruta grace the earth with her hand
As a mother daughter sister and a wife of a friend
The next time you're acting like you have the right of man
Then think about your mama baby girl and all of them
Think about your mama baby girl and all of them
Be a good girl do what you like
Out the door, don't ever come back
I won't try to stop you, you're just in my way
You're a fool anyway
Love me or leave me alone there goes the front door
Fighting over needs and wants because you want more
Gather all the updated news that's what we hunt for
Looking for the answer and choose the corner drugstore
Medicaid and self abuse is like a tug of war
Thought about the names I called you my Sharia Moore
Pour yourself a gin and juice head for the front door
Arguing until we're wreck loose I think we're done for
Five separate occasions you made a run for
Attempt to end the relations right through the front door
Yeah I was down for the cause but I said up yours
Dirty paws down my drawers and you went all four
Hardcore to vicious dogs you wanna solve porn
Heart's torn breaking the laws and it's an art form
A lost cause stating my cause we need to talk more
Erase your caller ID stay out at bars more
You probably cheated on me counting the sock chores
Then you aborted my seed pop it like popcorn
Killing off a piece of me rip out my heart's torn
Misery, lust company, boom movie soft porn
You can leave setting you free walk through the front door
You can leave spread your wings now we're done for
You can leave I'm setting you free make a run for
You can leave I'm making my peace appetite art form
You'll never be again, girl, do what you like
Out the door, don't ever come back
I won't try to stop you, you're just in my way
You're a fool anyway
