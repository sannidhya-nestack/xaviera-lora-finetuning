Yeah, I hear the hate, hear the, hear the
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Where my owls at? And where my gals at?
And to the fellas? Where my pounds at?
I know you found that? Nocturnal's about that
See into the darkness and let me get a soul clap
Uh! Now let me get a soul clap
And let me hear you say
Don't stop me! Don't stop me!
I don't let me get a soul clap
I don't let me get a soul clap
I don't let me get a soul clap
For the word
For the for the word
For the word
Get in get in the zone
For the word
For the word
And the words, and the words that you say, no, no, no, no, no, no
And the words, and the words, and the words, and the words
And the words get in the zone, get in, get in, get in the zone
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Spread the word, who are you? How do you do?
Come on here, sit down, grab a brew, join my crew
I'm hoping you don't think that I am preachy or pompous
I can promise you my intention was the opposite
see, I don't have much time to be talkin'bout partyin' or drinkin' wine
Still, I'll tell you how I lost my mind and then I got it back with a soul clap
And a ombre in the incense, wake the drones out
Don't get on the phone, spread the word, get in the zone
birds of a feather can fly through any weather
And I think it better if we unite the tribe and do this forever
I'll stack a little cheddar, eat it all together
Make a new gift to kinda me, then et about the past
Rewrite, think faster, put this track
Ohm blast, ohm ohm ohm ohm ohm ohm blast
Ohm ohm ohm ohm ohm ohmlast
Ohm ohm ohm ohm ohm ohm blast
Ohm ohm ohm ohm
Where my owls at? And where my gowls at?
And to the fellas, where my pounds at?
I know you found that, nocturnals about that
Singin' through the darkness, now let me get a soul clap
Where my owls at? And where my gowls at?
And to the fellas, where my pounds at?
I know you found that, nocturnals about that
Singin' through the darkness, now let me get a soul clap
Tho, th-th-tho, th-th-tho, th-th-th-tho
Pray the worm, tho, th-th-tho, th-th-th-tho
Go, go, go, friend of one, go, go, get in the zone, just go
Go, friend of one, go, go, friend of one, go
Go, go, friend of one, go, go go, friend of one
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
Get in the zone (Get in the zone'cause)
If, if, if, if, if, if, if-if, if-if, if-if, if, if-if, if-if-if-if-if-if-if, if-if, if, if, if, if-if-if-if-if, if, if, if, if, if-if-if-if-if-if
This is the end of the video. .
