Heaven or hell or hell or hell
The weight of the world and all its ugliness
Rests upon my consciousness causing me stress
Nevertheless I continue to inhale
Doing my time in this environmental cell
What the hell is the purpose for this drama?
Ima start to question my daddy and mama
Obama, nations causing Haitians to be stricken with diseases (diseases, diseases, diseases)
It's Jesus, just three more years'til he appears in the night
And all those without souls will be fearin' the sight of Armageddon
I'm lettin' go of all the show, concentrating on spiritual upliftment
So that I know my soul's gon' rest in peace (rest in peace)
I pray to the East but I look West for the antithesis
Ying and yanging, bean pie selling, carjacking and gang banging on the same fucking street
Quenshaw swap meet, bootlegging receipts, rolling urban dice
Stolen merchandise, MSG fried rice, fruit flavored malt lickers on ice
Police brutality, morality high, def comedy jam funny
My money, bitch you better have it, nah this ain't no rabbit
Hoe, real pimps wear mink
What you think? Kitchen sinks are being thrown in rhymes
These times, enzymes, deoxyribose, nucleic acid defines then confines
Unless you OJ, no way I say this type of shit
Specifically to convey a mental prism
To distort the light inside your iris
There's three of me, can't you see?
Horus, Isis, Osiris, heaven (heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven)
Heaven, heaven, heaven
I see my name up in lights but I don't see no marquee shining
I often ask myself why the hell I started rhyming
In the first place I got the worst case of paranoia
But life without lyrics is like G etown without the Hoya
I know you asking yourself who I think I am
Well that is just like asking what is in that can of Spam take your guess
Either you like it or you don't
But nothing I say will determine
If you will or won't be into
What my mental feels like expressing
I guess that's why some preachers
Thought I'd still be undressing
In front of more house scholars
For dollars and claps
They holler with their rings around their collar
Perhaps we have entered a new dimension
Way past the fifth
Some of y'all can see it
Cause some of y'all got the gift
The same gift that gave life to slaves to fit
The same gift that gave Isaac Hayes his hits
The same gift that gave Benjamin Mays his wits
The same gift that made Mark Furman et
That he had used the word nigga since 1986
And now it's clear that racism beyond the Mason-Dixon is real
How you feel?
Messing around trying to get a record deal
But still can't read beyond the level of seven
Guess what?
Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, Heaven
