Yeah
I'm in this club so down
I just feel so owned
Sayonara so long
If I take another sip I probably won't make it home
Am I in here alone?
Now somebody gotta be here
And all I really know is I'm finna take you home whenever we finna leave here
This spot so packed out, but to me it's deep through
Cause I don't even see a crowd, baby I only see you
You say you don't really need a man, but what if we never meet again
I don't wanna see you on CNN as a headline like we should meet again
I don't wanna come back too long
But I've been waiting all night long
For the DJ to play this song
So I can say I wanna take you home
Take you home
Take you home
I just wanna take you home
Big city bright lights
But you over shine that cause you my type
And you don't really need makeup
Cause you ain't gone have it on whenever you wake up
And whenever I say stay up
Tell me that you'll be waiting there
I'm switching in and out of lanes
Trying to find a different way
Cause baby I'm trying to make it there
I hope you get the message
I know it ain't a word but baby you the bestest
You deserve nothing less
This us against the world
I dare him to try to test it
When we hold each other close
Tell me what you should heard about
And put your gym clothes on
Cause baby I'm finna work it out
I don't wanna come back too long
But I've been waiting all night long
For the DJ to play this song
So I can say I wanna take you home
Take you home
Take you home
I just wanna take you home
When you step in the room stop
Can't nobody else stop it
And my topic of discussion is
I ain't really trippin' cuz I already got it
You the girl we all don’t, hey
We’re trying to find like wild out
And I’m on the same page
Cause I ain’t spitting game and telling you what we all know
Girl I’m putting my hand out
I’m hoping you would reach it
Cause baby girl you stand out
And you not just something I’m trying to sleep with
Don’t get me wrong I definitely would sleep with her
But my intentions is really meaning to be with her
Cause she something I never could explain
How she running like a tit yeah flyer than a plane
I don't wanna come back too long (I don't wanna come back too long)
But I've been waiting all night long (I've been waiting all night long)
For the DJ to play this song (For the DJ to play this song)
So I can say I wanna take you home (So I can say I wanna take you home)
Take you home (Take you home)
Take you home (Take you home)
I just wanna take you home, yeah
Yeah, you ever be out somewhere and you see a girl
And you like damn, if I don't talk now I might not ever see her again
But that's what I mean, you feel me?
Just wanna take you home, yeah
