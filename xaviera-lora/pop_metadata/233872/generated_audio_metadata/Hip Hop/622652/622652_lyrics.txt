This is dedicated to all those searching
Let us struggle together
Do you feel the love
As we connect as one
The world spins around
And I can't get enough
It's how I feel inside
Come and take me home
This is the satellite that has my life in soul
I had this broken faith
They say the time will heal
But in a world of fake
How do I define what's real
There is a war inside
Tell me how do I reveal
The satellite that my life is inclined to fill
These lessons have begun
The blessings by the one
Reflections of the sun
The message that is love
Physically I know I'm destined to be dust
Spiritually I know my quest is to be sung
And I'm no less than anybody who is networked in a system
That's designed to help us out when we learn to live
Though I'm nervous and concerned with what my purpose is
I shine in all my triumphs and I struggle through the worst of things
We are all the same no matter where we go
So why do we neglect a world that we pretend to barely know
These satellites and our soul can't be compared to gold
It's more like the moon and the sky anywhere it glows
Do you feel the love?
As we connect as one (yeah, yeah)
The world spins around (spins around)
Yeah, and I can't get enough (get enough)
It's how I feel inside (inside)
Come and take me home
This is the satellite that has my life in souls
Yeah, all I'm doing is obeying the spirit
That is trapped in my mind as I'm making these lyrics
It's forever changing every day that I'm living
It's motivating my drive as I'm breaking these limits
So the world might know me in a physical form
But I'm having conversations cause I listen to the Lord
And the truth is everybody's slipping in this war
And the proof that I have is not admissible in court
So I show by example and lead my life
Illuminating my path trying to be the light
On my feet by day on my knees at night
Working to stretch these goals to a decent height
So as I read and recite my history
Addressing this world as I spit my speech
So as you feel the bars of what my prison keeps
The satellite of my soul has me living free
Yeah, yeah
Do you feel the love
As we connect as one
The world spins around
Yeah, and I can't get enough
It's how I feel inside
Come and take me home
This is the satellite that has my life in store
Yeah, takes time to remember where you came from
Retracing my steps back to day one
Cause I'm hearing that it's all about the same love
And all these memories couldn't really fade us
So I'ma stay up and keep motivated
Stop selling us dreams so overrated
Be true if you really wanna grow strong
Hold on
I'm so gone (gone, gone, gone)
Do you feel the love (feel the love)
As we connect as one (yeah, yeah)
The world spins around (spins around)
Yeah, and I can't get enough (get enough)
It's how I feel inside (oh)
Come and take me home
This is the satellite that has my life and soul
Do you feel the love
As we connect as one
The world spins around
And I can't get enough
It's how I feel inside
Come and take me home
This is the satellite that has my life and soul
