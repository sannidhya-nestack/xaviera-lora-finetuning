Whether or not they recognize it is beside the point
Take a look at who the rappers in the sky annoying
The weaker hustle expose the word to the gun and the holster
I'm feeling like Biggie Smalls and pun on my shoulders
These niggas falling backwards
The stunning transformation
Turn a nigga from a human being to target practice
Stunner graduation
Magna cum laude
Shopping sprees, put new mileage on that blue Audi
Feel like I'm God's son, fucking the devil's daughter
Meanwhile I hypnotize the vipers, call me bezel charmer
My white chick tell me that she love my chocolate skin
My side chick tell me that she love the car I'm in
Better to leave them both behind than just desire zen
But with the throne comes the cheddar as we might some men
Hear the violins playing I compose a verse
It unfolds like I'm Michael Corleone in church
They say the way of meditation leads you down a path
I contemplate and then vacation in the south of France
Bring my crew with me what they calling for
Bitches powderin' they noses with a dollar straw
Mafia forever, GND is home
From the bottom of my feet you niggas see the throne
Forty minutes everyday I'm sittin' still in silence
My ears hearin' nothin' still don't keep my spirit quiet
They fear my rhymin', disregard the flow
It's time out for you niggas, I am haulin' oaths
Well connected like my last name was Inelli, nigga
Cuttin' bricks outta the wires in Pirelli's, nigga
Met a musel on the mic, I shit on every nigga
They speechless, "The fuck you gon' tell me, nigga?"
I'm a rockstar, call me Osbourne
I music, can't do it through a firestorm
Highly educated buddhas doesn't mean I'm bitch
They get the picture when the safety on the Nina switch
I protect the temple, opposite potential
When I die the only thing that resurrect is mental
Word to Tommy Brown, GND to Army now
Living on a prayer, Bon Jovi down
This is the life where bitches fuck with you to get ahead
And everyone you gave your life you think you better dead
Before the tears and the sweating you can bet I bled
If you a G then you just let it bring you better bread
Contradictions eat my soul alive
All I see is poltergeist
The mountain top in Ghana where I go to die
Or where I go to fly
None of you will ever know
I'll be the same whether it's heaven or to hell I go
They looking at me like they never seen B before
Looking at me like they never seen a king before
Put the crown on my head and I lean it low
Shiver when you see me, call me 23 below
And I'm God
I'm God
To you rappers, I'm God
I'm God
Huh
It's GND nigga
