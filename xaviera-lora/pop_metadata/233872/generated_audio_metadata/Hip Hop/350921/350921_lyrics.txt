Yeah, haha, it's your girl Toni Hickman aka Slim Goody, yeah

I'm getting my money, getting my money, getting my money man, give me my money
Don't care what you say about me, you talking I'm living L .I .F .E
A lover not a fighter man I'm all about the peace
Getting my money and stacking my G's
In the mirror and like what I see
A six foot nappy gal getting to the cream
I love my kinks and I love my hair
And if you disagree baby I don't care
These bitches wanna hate cause I get them on the track
And I eat them like steak when they pass me the plate
Now your attitude stank and this is what I think
When you hate you really think I'm great wow
I'm so sorry you're not on my level (on my level)
There's nothing I can do to make you feel better (make you feel better)
Judging me ain't gon' get you no cheddar (uh-huh)

Don't hate me cause I'mma go get em'
But me, that's the only way I know how to be
Anything else is something that's fake
And something that's fake is something I ain't
You do you and I'mma do me
Go ahead and be the best you you can be
The game is so cold but the game is so fair
Are you gonna be a piece in the game or a player? Yeah

Don't hate me cause I'm a broke widow
Getting my money, getting my money
Getting my money man, give me my money
I'm getting my money, getting my money

'Cause I'm a go-getter
I love money like BH1
Got a lot of people chasing only few get something
Gotta be a go-getter baby that's no front
Set up for what you get or go for what you want
You gotta get yours or at least try
As long as I got time I'ma get mine
Don't worry'bout me just worry'bout you
You can't count my money and your money too damn
I eat them like steak when they pass me the plate
