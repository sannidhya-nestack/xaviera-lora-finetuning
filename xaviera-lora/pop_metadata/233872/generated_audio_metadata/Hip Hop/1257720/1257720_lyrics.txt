Life's too short for messing with you
I'm moving on, finding something new
Had enough, breaking free
No more games, I just wanna be
Life's too short for all this mess
Time to shine, et the stress
Moving on, no looking back
Got my dreams on the right track
Life's too short, messing with you
I'm moving on, finding something new
Had enough, breaking free
No more games, I just wanna be
Life's too short for all this mess
Time to shine, et the stress
Moon giving on, no looking back
Got my dreams on the right track
Moving on and looking back
Got my dreams on the right track
