Midnight wander, neon glow
Street lights whisper, tempo slow
Lost in whispers from the past, they echo
Mind wander, the city's maze where stories grow
Train rumbles through the steel veins
Life's a carousel, no name, just refrains
Old man say we're ghosts in this urban game
Lost souls on skylines chasing fame
Liquid thoughts and cloudy motion
City dust mixed with ocean
Sips of dreams, pure emotion
Nighttime tales, slow devotion
Moon reflected in puddles deep
Dreams awaken while towns asleep
Toxicated whispers in the heat
Echoes of youth in the concrete beat
Strangers gather at the corner store
Tongues twist, tales of yester-yor
Street philosophers, truth they implore
Life's a riddle, what's it for?
Jazz notes tumble from the speakeasy door
Brush strokes of life on urban campus more
Stories that are twined like vines, lore
City symphony, eternal encore
The boss, sending the pods to boss
Liquid thoughts and cloudy motion
Odds and cloudy motion
City dust mixed with ocean
Sips on dreams, pure emotion
Dreams awaken while towns asleep
Toxicated whispers in the heat
Echoes of youth in the concrete beat
Moon reflected in puddles deep
Dreams awaken while towns asleep
Toxicated whispers in the heat
Echoes of youth in the concrete beat
Strangers gather at the corner store
Tongues twist tales of yester-yor
Street philosophers truth they implore
Life's a riddle, what's it for?
Jazz notes tumble from the speed easy door
Brush strokes of life on urban canvas more
Stories intertwine like vines, lore
City symphony, eternal encore
