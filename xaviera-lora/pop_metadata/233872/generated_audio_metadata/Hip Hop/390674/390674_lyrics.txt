Come deep in the mind of seven
Heavenly father see my demons screaming
(Eternity, your)
Lost soul no night of dreaming
Where all of my true homies they end up dead in a coffin
But if what you see ya'll better don't know these things they happen often
Sagging, dressed in blacking
Sweater my braids, flagging
Instead of be packing, just to get paid
Whatever it takes to name it a game one day will fall
If these walls could talk see my secrets in the dark
West side till I die embedded to my rest
Nothing but a heartbeat away still I can feel the stress
Like the cest in my chest expect nothing less the best
Rough and raw sex no regrets or requests
The ends to the E to the V to the E to the N
No friends simply for the reason down to the N
Retire expire yo ass with ease
Rude boy style black suburban on 18's
Damn embrace my faith lace lost and crazed for days
And I see you know that the body you can't erase
But it comes down to it blaze see you paranoid
My life or your life soon gonna be void
Yes indeed I proceed to just serve
With urge emerge from the dead suckers with nerve
Word the roughness though bluff just the real
With a big African snake for your mouth can you feel me
Bossing loving anything or nothing
Dumping to the beat I'm bumping
No future in front all of a sudden
I'm on a major paper mission
Mission of getting mine
Mission try to make a living
And mission of getting by
In this doggy dog world
Dime for dime
Time to shine in line with rhymes
Mother fuck the crimes
High loaded coated and heavy
Visions of getting buried cemeteries
See I can see it clearly now
So batter up get ready for the home run hitter
Did I do the servants were in all bull shitters
For the tongue that's breaking them off
With or without the quickness
Take this
Lower it out of your mind
Merry Christmas
What is this repentance
Relentless resistance within this
For instance but it won't stop the persistence
So say bang
For the people that are dying
Recognize till I die, eyes on the prize and ride rise and realize
