If you wanna fuck with pros come and rock with us
If you the type to get live come and rock with us
Anybody wanna ride come and rock with us right now
Ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to the best thing in rap since the Panipani
Getting mad again
Three MC's take on the industry battling
From NY to LA to MI to Maryland
Rock with a couple rude boys hit up the block with
Pop, seek and destroy your topics
Source rips it like the paper in your toilet
Stay hot like the water on your stove steady boiling
I chew cause it's untight
All I need is one mic got mama telling papa
Baby we done done right no sunlight no context
Rock with the best
This one right's too complex to be considered average
Phenomenal rap music articles
See how far we go with the flow do-si-do
Unpredictable my razor sharp tongue spit at you
Three shots for real three shots for the lyrical
Pitiful MC's are left blowing in the breeze
Like the fall of the leaves from the red maple tree
Ask around the block if you need some guaranteed
But it's guaranteed nobody's fucking these MC's
Up in the P's got G's shorties call me poppy
Rhyming ever since before Joe was
Sloppy, you gonna need a Russian army try to stop
Three sauce mac and soppy, don't ever try to copy us (if you know you got soul come and rock with us)
If you wanna fuck with pros come and rock with us
If you the type to get live come and rock with us
Anybody wanna ride come and rock with us
If you know you got soul come and rock with us
If you wanna fuck with us
You pros come and rock with us, if you the type to get live, come and rock with us
Anybody wanna rock, come and rock with us, right now
There was some money where my body crashed and some body snatches to capture the crowd like undersea
But nobody moving, surely not the answer, now throw your hands up
The only thing you probably lose once you freeze
It's your mind and it's all psychological
Think about it
Why the side clothes beat you down with
Another bank I got us up and anger management
To the Mad Max, my crew ain't having it
The last laugh, certainly yours
No jokes, these thugs, what the f we look like
Letting niggas lie through without saying goodnight
Rocking the sleeve, the bottle gets deep
In the underground
Sam's be smashin' pumpkins
From sleeping hollow to Key Lago
Causing mass destruction
On this rap production
Won't see tomorrow if that bitch is frontin'
Now non-believers push the padding button
Soon as they see it, save all apologies
If not a seize, they just write a lot
Call gingivitis with that writing's block
Automatic bars we spittin'
Might get shot playin' the opposition
Makin' it hot and sizzlin', warnin'
Holly Flammable, my guys who damage you performance
Not on the stage but here's an offer (If you know you got soul)
(Come and rap with us) (If you wanna)
If you the type to get live, come and rock with us
Anybody wanna ride, come and rock with us
If you know you got soul, come and rock with us
If you wanna fuck with pros, come and rock with us
If you the type to get live, come and rock with us
Anybody wanna ride, come and rock with us
Right now, yo stop!
Beat drops, I'm ready to rock like a drug spot (pluck, pluck, pluck)
I'm so reppin' so you can raise your hands but no questions
I'm guaranteed rhyme, I'm a certified weapon (rock)
I said rock, head bangin', can't put a wild dog on a leash and leave him hangin'
This symphony bad, ain't it? With mackerel hot as fuck, got the track flamin'
On fire'til I retire with back painin'
I'm on the field maintainin', playin', no playin'
I spark a filly up, then spark a semi-wet
Get what you wanted'cause you want that Gimme Gimme stuff
See Savvy got this bitch on lock, get it, get it crunk
But nothing with fucking punks
Bullets to the ground that criss cross
Jump jump jump
Saucer rip straight at you like a double barrel shotgun
Stutter you shook boy if I'm letting your mouth run
Eat you fucks up just as quick as you come
Left numb feeling the rush
Playing it loud moving the crowd
Burning like dutch to master the sound
Streets is hot got the ghetto jumping cause they feel it
Fry catch me at a jam rocking the fans like room ceilings
Girls say I'm so appealing
Just wait till they put me in crates
I'm worldwide known for moving the station
From the lost to the saved, man (rock with us)
B-Boys and B-Girls, you gotta (rock with us)
A-Body round the world, you gotta (rock with us)
M-I-A-N-Y comin' (rock with us)
Philly and my doors in shock comin' (rock with us)
Cali riders in the Lacks rollin' (rock with us)
Don't matter if you white or black, man (rock with us)
My bus shuts up, I put that in a test (rock with us)
And if you tougher than leather, just (rock with us)
Spit no matter what the weather's still (rock with us)
For always and forever, yo, rock with us, rock with us, rock with us, rock with us, yeah, rock with us, rock with us, rock with us, rock with us, rock with us, yeah, rock with us, rock with us, rock with us, rock with us, rock with us, rock with us, yeah, rock with us, yeah, rock with us, yeah, rock with us
Hey, Mack's fake laughing over here. That bitch is like this, "Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh." Sound like Eddie Murphy.
