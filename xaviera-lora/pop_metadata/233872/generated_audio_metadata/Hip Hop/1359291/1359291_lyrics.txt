In the digital dusk, the sisters rise
First and last and always defies
Beyond the floodland, the sound encrypts
Binary heartbeats, black lipstick lips
The sisters of mercy, mercy means I'm me (me)
Cut me and touch me, I love the way you, you hurt me
Through vision bank they thread the code
Dark waves streaming under all upload
Temple of love in a virtual haze
Cypher and anthems of modern malaise
Sisters of mercy, mercy, misami
Make me, touch me, I love the way you, you
The sisters of mercy, mercy
Means on me, cut me and touch me
I love the way you, you hurt me
Lost in the grid, their echo remain
A sonic virus haunting the mainframe
The sisters of mercy in their big brain
In the binary world, inject, release
Hit me on the main
Right to the brain
Hit me on the neck, right to the brain
The sisters of mercy, the sisters of mercy
A picture of pleasure in seductive measure
Pain weaves a melody darker than your dreams
It seems could ever be
Sisters of mercy
Sisters of mercy
Drip from the stars yeah I slide through the static
Dreams turn gold when the beat goes manic
Time bends bad now I'm lost in the fabric
Pulse so loud it's a cosmic panic
Blood in my veins got a mirror for mine
Words be in space when I hit that line
Echo in the glass let's rewind so fine
Zero G flow on zero time climb
Ultraviolet smoke I'm a lucid spark
Flow through the night like a flame in the dark
Face like vanilla leaves a mark
I'm the glitch in your dream so mantle
Sisters of mercy
Mercy, please I mean
Cut me and touch me
I love the way you hurt me
