This is the one moment that I never thought I could live through
This is the one moment that I never thought I could live through
This is the one moment that I never thought I would live through
This is the one moment that I never thought I would live through
This is the one moment
You gots to hear me
Download the track
And pump it in your city
Watch how that flow attract
Gilo on jaw you can stop by my station
And get your whole journal filled with proper narrowization
The beat so sick the lyrics so proper
To listen you will have to get a prescription from your doctor
Take my last verse, put it in quotations
A hundred and sixty MC's catch true salvation
Hold up, chill, here's a proper refill
Jah draped me with these skills, so I'm addressed to kill
I'm not playin', I stick to the thesis
Spit so explosives I flooded a thousand districts
I am music, I enhance corporations
And I run the departments of public relations
In my spare time, I'm big time
One time I bought time that I still can't find, come on
This is the one moment that I never thought I could live through
This is the one moment that I never thought I could live through
This is the one moment that I never thought I would live through
This is the one moment that I never thought I would live through
This is the one moment that I never thought I'd live through
You can see how hard I try
No question in society is why
I say to maintain
The acceptance of change
Especially the same
Y'all just learning I invented word games
Merely entertained
With tickets to events held at world games
I can see the pain but where's the shame
The deception in the brain standing dry in the rain
You let them dames uplift your fame
Let's go to sunny days in the Midwest
With music to invest
Navigate right left within a conquest
And we still the best
Careful when wise on the set
So the groove gone stay correct
Let me mention first it was good
But now it's sour to me
I don't take it personal
I take the bitter with the sweet
I dare you try to test the man
Love and combat goes together like hand in hand
This is the one moment that I never thought I could live through
This is the one moment that I never thought I could live through
This is the one moment that I never thought I could live through
This is the one moment that I never thought I would live through
This is the one moment that I never thought I would live through
I will rock and roll in every story that gets told
My music is console guaranteed in every album sold
Even without a mic I flow remote control
From the time that they stole it returned tenfold
My sight is on the road just in case there's a toll
Blindness is a substance spread out like fools ghost
Get tripped and put in multiple choke holds
Underground street and roll where the wind blow so cold
Lyrical transport take over the soul
Whenever I won't play a look I get set by the whole
South Pole patrol just because of vocal control
And every time I appear you hear them drum rolls
My eyes show me everything, jaws peeping
My clothes reap particular sensi that I'm chiefing
What you use? Them mic utensils
I use my pocket, my mental, the pad, number two pencil
This is the one moment that I never thought I could live through
This is the one, this is the one moment that I never thought I could live through
This is the one, this is the one moment that I never thought I could live through
This is the one, this is the one moment I never thought I could live through
This is the one, this is the one moment
