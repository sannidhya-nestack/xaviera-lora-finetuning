Damn I know you want it
Girls they buying drinks
Like they buying minks
There's no time to think
Sex in the air on the beach on the sink
What you waiting for
Time to sip some more
Treat these cocktails like it's city
Go on go on tour tour tour
Voluptuous vixens, finpey toads, they be always drinking
Every weekend they frequent clubs and bars just for one reason
Tongue-kneading, coke and rum meetings, love squeezing
Liquor by the bottles, body shots on models
Girls they buying drinks
Like they buying minks, there's no time to think
Sex in the air on the beach on the sink
What you waiting for, time to sip some more
Treat these cocktails like a city go on tour
Red margaritas, sauced up señoritas
Oh mama mia, tequila shots for divas
Act like you own the bar
Act like a superstar, out clubbing with your girls
It's time to go real hard, go hard baby, yeah you the best
The kings are in the club like we love chess
My queens in the club cause I love chess
Your booty got me high like I'm obsessed
Drink a little more then what's next
Take it off and get undressed
X-ray vision when I'm drunk you'll see
Right through you I can tell that you want sex
Girls they buying dreams, like they buying minks
There's no time to think
Sex in the air on the beach on the six
What you waiting for
Time to drink some more
Treat these cocktails like a city
Go on go on tour tour tour tour tour tour tour tour tour
That's right girl
Let's live young
Alright girl
Come get some
All night girl
Or this one
This my world
Let's get drunk
Let's get drunk
Let's get drunk
This my world
Let's get drunk
Let's get drunk
Let's get drunk
This my world
Let's get drunk
