This is Co-Anthony Brownsville, channel 9-11 here in the heart of America
Today we're talking about society, how we are struggling as a country
It's like something tearing or pulling at the very seam of the American dream
I think we really have to start to look into this thing because we're on the border of too late
Keep your ears tuned to 9 /11 here in the heart of America
As the sun here rises, his feet hit the floor
Don't really go to school, but he gotta hit that front door
Meet them fellas at the bus stop, they plottin' to jack
Need some courage, by 730 they shakin' the sack
Caught his buzz, but all of a sudden this bitch was movin' slow
Heard the shots from the drop, time by that time
He hit the floor, yeah them cats up the streets
Last week they had beef, plus they holding the grudge
You know we lock down the streets, yeah revenge is the ultimate weapon here in the ghetto
Heard my pride, you gotta die, it ain't cool, no I can't let go
So we plotting to make his heart stop beating
Give his team a reality check and make his mom stop eating
It's like Shoji Cabana, snatch him up in the collar
We play for keeps on my streets, when I creep you gon' holla
Couldn't see nothing, he's clutching on the side of the stretcher
Last words you recall, told you cats I wet ya
Joe Bars and hood scars in his past, what's in his future?
From the hood, here's a pamphlet on how they do ya
Now they at the club, as if nothing had happened
That's when them killers walk in, Scopey Mildin start cappin'
Knockin' over the tables, grabbin' girls for protection
Hit two mothers in the white dome cars, they catch'em
Shorties wanna be hardcore, but I can't see it
Think it's a joke, get your Metro paper and read it
I'm in the motel (na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
California, in the motel, California, I'm in the motel, California, in the motel, California, la-di-da-di-da-di-da-di, California
In the motel, California
In the motel, California
Swerving down 75, tears in my eyes
Finally came to the conclusion, we living to die
I know I'm not the only one who feels that fact
Maybe I am the only one that feels that fact
Back in the kayak
My heart's on overload, another tale of bad news
I just might explode, sorry to hear it, the story goes
But when the doors close, who's here? Nobody but me
To carry my load, Lord help me
I keep hitting my knees, but it's bouncing off the ceiling
Coming back at me, yo, I freeze for a second
And turn on the tube, brushed by the unbearable news
Of shooting at school, another baby's born addicted to blow
How it get into a system? Yeah, you already know
Let's check out that same system
You see what they give'em
A legal prescription
Keeps'em high, now that's prison
I'm in the motel, California
In the motel, California
I'm in the motel, California
In the motel, California
I'm in a motel in California (Stay tuned for more details)
In a motel in California (In a motel in California)
Is it really the land of the free, home of the brave?
I wonder how many times this gon' get played
Knew it was over when them planes hit the Twin Towers
It shook us for hours, the world traced it up
Maybe the Oklahoma bombing cast claimed that they should dime it
But they can't feel common, terrorist attack
Those who died, see you in heaven
Stayin' on the guard, never another 9 /11
I'm in the motel, California
In the motel, California
I'm in the motel, California
In the motel, California
America has never been the type of country that didn't rise to the occasion
You're wondering, where has all the hope gone?
