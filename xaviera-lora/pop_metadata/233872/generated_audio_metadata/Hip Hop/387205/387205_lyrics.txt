See I don't walk on fire, I walk on water
I walk on sand and I walk tall man can you hear me now
Hey can you feel me now
See I don't walk on fire, I walk on water
I walk on sand and I walk tall man can you hear me now
Hey can you feel me now
No man can hold me down
Hold me down, I said no man can hold me down
Jah said, no one can hold me down
Hold me down, I said no man can hold me down
Jah say
Don't want get hold me down
Rub your face tough
The ends if you being too struggle
Too many rats in this jungle
So I keep on ing on
Since the day I was born
I been a trouble to my mom
Word is born
Grandma told me I would see
21 I grab me a gun
Living life like a muscle man
Kill a couple men
I ain't scared to shoot a faggot man
I'm a change man
We ain't wanna keep on pushing it
Hey wait
Cause you ain't off with a family man
I got better plans
Big dreams to come true
All your troops
It's the truth, yeah, I'm ziggin' the cat-puss, very moose
Yeah, I lose, we got this game like an octopus
Ziggin' better move'cause no time for them twenty-twos
Thirty-inch slugs when I'm puffin' on the collie whip
Ziggin' bleed between they heart when they see the kiss
Rockin' so deep, everybody wanna be me
From rappin' and singin', damn, I'm gonna make it
See, I done walked some fire, I walked some water
I walked some sand and I walked on land
Can you hear me now?
Hey, can you feel me now?
See I done walked on fire, I walked on water, I walked on sand, and I walked on land, can you hear me now? (Can you hear me now?)
Can you feel me now? (Can you feel me now?) No man, you're out of your mind now
Ayy yo, I'm broke like a chip, yeah, talk like a chip, yeah, and the swag is so sick, and the hoodie's safe
And if your hands ain't in the air put those up
It's Big J, yo, I'm comin' straight for the top
Need ten zeros in the bank as soon as this drop
And album release, the whole world gon' cop
And I'm sorry to say this, but I'm gon' shop
I got my fitted on, my monkeys on, my wrist game mean
You should see the whip pose, oh man, it's obscene
Dollar signs in my eyes'cause all I see is green
And I'm feelin' like the king, so I'm lookin' for a queen
I walk on fire, I walk on water
I walk on sand and I walk on land, can you hear me now?
Hey, can you feel me now?
See, I don't walk on fire, I walk on water
I walk on sand and I walk on land
Can you hear me now?
Hey, can you feel me now?
No man can hold me down
Hold me down
I said no man can hold me down
Jah said no one can hold me down
Hold me down
I said no man can hold me down
Yeah I said no one can hold me down
