You can't stop, won't stop, can't stop, won't stop, can't stop, won't stop
Yeah yeah yeah
Come head up out of the alleyways
Live it up right from the city of fingers
Mo' bounce to the'ounce
Serve it up from minor to major, yeah
It's all about stacking paper no doubt
Serve it up in the mix with a rock and stick mavericks in the house
Hit'em up with the boy style for the west side
Come cover the black clothes that's why
It ain't all about where you're from
It's all about where you're at
Recognize where the rain is going down
Pound for pound
Fresh out the box
Wrecking money makes the world go round
Now to proceed with extreme caution
Is a must
Till I die
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Pay the price and repercussions
Ain't no future in frontin'
Representing down to the fullest
Straight up 9-00-19
But ghetto star see it's all good
For the way it goes
So the way it shows
To your neck of the woods
That's who commands the flow of the passion
So trick or treat
Tell me how you like me now
Save it or rock us
Putting it down with extreme caution
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
What can I say but that I'm in love with this rap shit
Perhaps to the fact I'm tapping ass while I stack chips
Nothing more better getting cheddar let alone be the cut up
Ain't nothing going on but the party let me blaze the butt up
Word up to all of my peeps from NYC to LA
For the east to the west nothing but love not a nothing do
So why don't you bring it back, swing it back
Fresh out the west, stressed with constant threat
Nearing early death now to proceed with extreme caution
It's a must, sharks in the dark, for the fact jealous and scandalous
Cautious without cause, against all odds
Secrets in the dark, money talks, bullshit walks
But baby don't see it's all good
For the way it goes, for the way it shows to your neck of the woods
Now to commence the flow of the passion
So trick or treats, tell me how you like me now
Save it or rock us, putting it down with extreme caution
Can't stop, won't stop, can't stop, won't stop, can't stop won't stop, can't stop, won't stop, can't stop, won't stop, can stop, won't stop, can't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Tell me what the hell do you like me now?
Can't stop, won't stop
How would you like it?
Where would you like it?
Somebody tell me what the hell
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop
