Oh, man
What's up, man?
La-da-da-da, la-da-da-da
Yo, what you singing, man?
It's a new hectic song, baby
Who's hectic?
You mean you never heard of hectic?
Oh, what's it?
So fly, la-da-da
Oh, Nana, no Osama
Go bananas, oh, Zuzana
I keep that sticky-icky
Smokey, smokey, okie-dokie
I spit that killy-willy
Illy-skilly hit the filly
I get the latest baby, I just like the birdie birdie
My alien hurts your feelings, stuff your face like turkey filling
I'm from from Harlem, from the bottom to the top son
I got a big fat pot of potter, fuck some smoking lotter
Owe your owner forty five a dollar, holla
Who oh he
In the sky, watch your chick, he's a pimp, he's a pimp (hey)
Her ass in the joint, that's the point, that's the point (hey)
La-de-da-de, mami-mami, I like to party-party
I'm Harley off of Marley, Mardi Gras-ti, little Bobby
Stay away from Father Johnny, holy moly, y'all don't know me
This one's only for the morning, homie (my bad), homie
My pants look saggy, faggy
Haters cry like satin waddies
Don't date me, no don't date me
Most y'all chicks be flaky shaky
Mojitas, oh but Jesus
So damn broke I just got beepers
Don't know me, listen homie
This is what they call me
Oh oh oh he so fly
He's a guy, he's a guy, hey
Oh oh oh he so hot
In the sky, in the sky, hey
Oh oh oh watch your cheek
That's him to join, that's the point, that's the point, hey
Yo, fast dragon, ten at a time packin'
Go ahead papi, jump in the bandwagon
Sad ain't it, look he done made it
Hooked on the guns ain't he, croak on the run crazy
I never had no cash before, flash before
Never had a rash before, before
Fat bitches never done a bash before
But now I'm back for more,'bout to attack these hoes
Hey, take a bigger giga, give me some money
I wanna say I'm happy but I'm not, give me your wallet
Sorry buddy, I don't care for honey's dunny
You just a big fat dummy, Nickelodeon flow
Stay away, come be a crummy
Sonny, you better run from me
Lil Hector, the chicken dresser
The pin finesser, dope protector
Hawke-ta, Mochetta
You guess-a, cryptoblessa
Ooh woah, he's so fly
He's that guy, he's that guy
Ooh woah, he's so hot
In the sky, in the sky
Ooh woah, watch your cheek
Master Point, Master Point, happy
