Baby baby, she's a small town lady
No stop lights that small town crazy
Growing up first kiss no tongue came from a neighbor
Never wasted, never been high higher education is what she wants to make it
So she stacking wages making them grades and filling applications
Now it's August and she's eous
Headed off to college now she's living all lawless
Had respect for her father ever since she was a toddler
So she's never skipping class and she's never getting topless
So polished by day getting knowledge
And at night you can find out where the shots is
But her track record's spotless so when it comes time
Yeah she's running from the coppers
Go and get it girl
Go and walk that world
Let your light shine and bright then you do it again
Go and get it girl
Go and take that world, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
When she saw it, she fell for the lights
Saint Paul, mini-yap, get it on tight
Get it all night, she did it on her own
No need to look, she made that her home
Girl on fire, Miss Independent
Met a couple dudes but these dudes ain't with it
Gotta find love, reason we in it
You can't slow down, we live for the minutes
I'm with it, mid-twenties, it was reason enough
Got a ticket for the Greyhound bus
One stop, one light, one city, one night
One path, one right and she left from here
So what would you do with dreams to make?
Would you seize the maze or would you leave the place?
Yeah, then she looked right up in the sky
I won't stop'til the world is mine (world is mine, world is mine)
Go and get it girl
Go and walk that world
Let your light shine and bright then you do it again
Go and get it girl
Go and take that world, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dreams shoot for the moon
Trust is what we all need to do
Love is what we all need to find
Open up your heart, let the world inside
Dreams shoot for the moon
Trust is what we all need to do
Love is what we all need to find
Open up your heart, let the world inside
Go and get it girl (go and get it girl)
Go and walk that world (walk that world)
Let your light (let your light)
Shine it bright then you'll do it again
Go and get it girl (get it girl)
Go and take that world, yeah yeah
Go and take that world, yeah yeah
