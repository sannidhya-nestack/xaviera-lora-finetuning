She's on the phone like you don't even matter to her
She's been on ice, can't deny that you hate her some more
She's going crazy, probably leaving, but it feels like a good thing
She is your hunger, she's been waiting all this time, she'll be alright
She's on the phone like you don't even matter to her
She said I'm wise and a nice person, but more
She's always crazy for me, lazy for me, just doesn't matter
She is the hunter that's been stealing all the pieces you left
She's holding forward to tell you tomorrow
She's fed her lies, can't deny that she needs some more
She's going crazy for me lately, and I just think I love her
She is the hope that is my savior, the peace of your life
She's on the phone like you don't even matter to her
She said her life can't be nice if you hate it some more
She's going crazy for me like you can't even see the truth in her
She is a hunter and she's hearing all the pieces you left
She's on the phone like you don't even matter to her
She's spitting lies, can't deny that you hate her so much
She's going crazy, only making it worse for the better
She is a hunker, this is how you know
