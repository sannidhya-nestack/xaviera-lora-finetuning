Riding down the street, I'm still muggin' all these hoochies hit my phone
They still buggin', I'm just tryna get the cash
It's not a full discussion, I need dollars in my clutches
I was grindin' when you wasn't, out on the'ave, give me all the cash
We gon' make it happen, finish first, not last
Look at how I dash to extract the money bags
In the jungle stay humble, the lion never brash, loot up on the dash
Foot up on the gas
Smilin as I pass so the puppa won't harass
Fly by in a flash and I'm headed to the stash
Spinning corners so fast that I might crash
I swear it's no mistake and me and mines gon make it
If you don't give it then we gon take it
Swear that I'm the greatest if you owe it imma leave your pockets vacant
Trick I'm just sayin
Gimme my money
Gimme my money
My money
Dollar dollar bill yall
Gimme my money
Give me my money, my money, I need all my millions
Give me my money, give me my money, my money, no excuses just G's
Give me my money, give me my money, My money
Dollar dollar bill yah, give me my money
We out here grindin tryna double what we got
Get the paper cause the haters talk about you if you not
When I woke up this morning I hopped out the bed
And had dollar signs on my mind and my head
So I got dressed no doubt I look fresh
No time to waste sleep's the cousin of death
And I'ma come correct till my very last breath
If they hate me then they hate me cause I'm better than the rest
I got my grass cut low
'Cause it's disloyal snakes that's cutthroat (cutthroat)
That'll write you up a love note (love note)
Gain your trust and leave you under a tugboat
Drowning, drowning, drowning, drowning, drowning
When I'm broadcasting I keep it one thousand
When it's a rumble in your tummy don't no joke seem funny
If you owe me then I'm coming right now like
Gimme my money (my money)
Solid dollar bill y'all
Gimme my money
Gimme my money
My money
I need all my billions
Gimme my money
Gimme my money
My money
No excuses just G's
Gimme my money
Gimme my money
My money
Solid dollar bill y'all
Gimme my money
I'm on the freeway burning rubber
In all black like an undercover
So fly I feel like I might hover
For the money I'm a fighter not a lover
Pull up hop out in the heat of the night
Briefcase in my hand with they suit in a tight
I got the best product it won't get any better
You can have it all if you give me my check (give me my money)
Give me my money (my money)
Dollar dollar bill y'all (give me my money)
Give me my money (my money)
I need all my bills (dollar dollar bill y'all)
Give me my money
Give me my money (my money)
No excuses just G's (dollar dollar bill y'all)

Dollar dollar bill y'all (check)
Give me my money
