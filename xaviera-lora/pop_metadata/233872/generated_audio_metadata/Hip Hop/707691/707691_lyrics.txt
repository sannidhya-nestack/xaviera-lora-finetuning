Hell yeah, it's on now
Finna take me a ride out love that cut straight to the dome now
And I got my trunk wang bangin up in yo area
I'm waking up all yo neighbors like it's a bomb scare terror alert
I keep my music bumpin like Radio Rahim
And plus the whippers lookin stupid haters might try to call it a pipe dream
But they just mad cuz they still beatin they feet
While I'm scoopin up all they women up in they hood they tryna peep
And her stuff is so funny, always putting something in her tummy
She's the freshest, so clean, never bummy
And I got the liquor on ice getting scummy
And I know it must look ignorant to the outside looking in
But they just jealous, mad'cause they can actually see the reflection through my rims
I keep my music bumping harder than a Harley
They rev it up, then I turn it up and you can't even hear'em hardly
Quick to hit the mute button every time the cops pass
if they catch you slipping in a pound in a whip
But it's just like a game of tag
While I'm rolling up in your hood, I got my trunk rattling
Plus I'm always up to no good, just let your speakers bang
Gone and turn this music on up, let's go on and break the law
While we light another one up, just let your speakers bang
While I'm rolling up in your hood, I got my trunk rattling
Plus I'm always up to no good, just let your speakers bang
Gone and turn this music on up
Let's gone and break the law
While we turn another one up (just let your speakers back)
Hell yeah, I'm feeling so perfect now
I thought I was driving straight but they just say that I'm swerving wild
And I got them gorillas they beating up out my trunk
And I will damage up out your ear drums
As you can see man I'm known to stunt
And my rims are saying hi to all you haters
I'm disturbing all your neighbors
Hear me beating in the top of a skyscraper
So later with that positive talk
Cause if you had it you would floss
It costs or it pays off
And the stakes are pretty high
When it comes to the street
Get my hair bigger when I drive by
And I let my dogs off the leash man
And I'm setting off every alarm up on your block
When I ride through
It's hard to order your food
Cause I bangin hard up in the drive through
And they say I'm so damn ignorant
Cause I got more cars parked on the block than a Mexican immigrant
You gots to stay up on your P's and Q's
Cause if you get caught slipping well then you snooze you lose
Just let your speakers bang
While I'm rolling up in your hood I got my trunk rattling
Plus I'm always up to no good
Just let your speakers bang
Go on and turn this music on up
Let's go on and break the law while we light another one up
Just let your speakers bang
While I'm rolling up in your hood I got my trunk rattling
Plus I'm always up to no good
Just let your speakers bang
Gone and turn this music on up
Let's go on and break the law
While we turn another one up
Just let your speakers bang
Hell yeah
I can feel it now
Finna take me and flip through that grey goop straight to the grill now
And my music's turnt up to the maximum mobility
So all you people say gotta go to work
Y'all just ain't feeling me
Y'all done made me bust out my hotel on wheels
Look at that chick she's working a street pole
Like a stripper in her high heels
You gotta be crazy if you think I'm about to turn it down
Never seen your lips moving but I really can't even hear a sound
And I really don't mean to crack myself up
But it seems every time I'm wanging on your block
I can see you waiting on the bus
And that's through rain, sleet and snow
I keep it bumping, I'm cracking the bottle
I'm cranking my music like I ain't worried about nothing
And I'm not the type of guy who likes to brag and boast
But every time you open up my door
You can smell me blowing on that good smoke
And I'm not talking about that swag that you be puffing on
If you're getting the whip don't mess with the levels
Got upset how well I could just turn it on?
Just let your speakers bang
While I'm rolling up in your hood, I got my trunk rattling
Plus I'm always up to no good, just let your speakers bang
Gone and turn this music on up, let's gone and break the law
While we light another one up, just let your speakers bang
While I'm rolling up in your hood, I got my trunk rattling
Plus I'm always up to no good, just let your speakers bang
Gone and turn this music on up, let'sgone and break the law
While we turn another one up, just let your speakers bang
