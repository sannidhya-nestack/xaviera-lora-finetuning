Aye yo, showtime, this is how we do it, I'm ready, yeah, yeah, yo, yo
This track here let everybody know
Skip dogs here with the everybody flow
This be the one that bring em to the show
Get em on up then to the dance floor
I wanna be Snoop but I look like Sting
Man on the mic and I've got that swing
Crowds look shocked every time that I sing
Y'all can feel me it's not a sin
Ladies you can look and touch
Two at a time cause I like double Dutch
Well you know who's coming through in a clutch in a club
Even thugs be putting up wands
Winter to summer, spring to the fall
Skip got a lock like keys in a car
Man I've rocked the block to the mall
Philly to LA I done did it all
London, Paris, Monte Carlo, Germany and Rome
Different places, different faces, still it feels like home
China, Holland, Belgium, Rio, Africa, Japan, that's the life
I live and I live any way that I can
You know I'm fresh, sick and slick
Did a photo shoot just for my kicks
Got something that I'd like to admit
I got a little thing for half Asian chicks
Can't lie everyone is a cutie
Chain me up like Sloth in the Goonies
Call me dad like Darth in the movies
Don't even get started on the movies
Myspace .com /skipdan
Having a girl stuck like quicksand
Have a head spinning round like Rims man
Leaning on me like I'm a kickstand
One year back I was real sick man
Got so skinny I was called stick man
But I bulked up and I'm making hits man
Hands in the air damn raise the drink fam
London, Paris, Monaco, Germany and Rome
Different places, different faces, still it feels like home
China, Holland, Belgium, Rio, Africa, Japan, that's the life
I live and I live any way that I can
I play ball, I block shots, they call me the wall
If y'all got love, I got love for y'all
If y'all wanna hate, I still love y'all
I got all this love in my heart
Tat lower back and I'm loving her art
All this blood's pumping up in my heart
Lift my hood and give a jump start
Pop clutch and push me hard
My flows ride low, they leave sparks
My bravado walks the walk
I'm versatile like a flow to a harp
When you hear this song in your head
I'll make you drop like a spider on a web
I love in the club how the rules get bent
And you can jump on it even though we just met
London, Paris, Monte Carlo, Germany and Rome
Different places, different faces, still it feels like home
China, Holland, Belgium, Rio, Africa, Japan that's the life
I live and I live any way that I can
In Paris, Monte Carlo, Germany and home
Different places, different faces, still it feels like home
China, Holland, Belgium, Rio, Africa, Japan, that's the life
I live and I live any way that I can
I see you like it like it
I know you like it like it
Come on don't fight it fight it
You know you like it like it
I see you like it like it
I know you like it like it
Come on don't fight it fight it
You know you like it like it
