Everybody get fat when the king gone
Till the word come back that the kings home
Got my team on smash green on stack
Better run fast like the king stone
Switch up on the fast that they don't know
Black bags full of cash on the low low
Can't sit here while I'm stacking with a low pro
Till we rise and attack the zone no
One time for the G put it in the sky
Two time for the D if you feel the vibe
Remember everybody doubt now it's everybody shouting
Over 35 thousand I feel alive
Black Robin Hood click GND fam
Born odd just a boss with a deep clan
Pray to Buddha just to live in a free family
Up high hope he never let my feet land
We the new icons of the street dream
In a new fly car bump a beep beep
And we do it for the beggars and we doing it for Haiti
And we do it for the people when they can't sleep
Can't sleep in the night so I rise up
I be riding through your city in a white truck
G and D blacklist all the wack rap ish
If I see you on the mic then it's time sup
See me coming down the block with my bass loud
Had to dumb it down and not sort of hate now
Meditating in the temple all the pain in my mental if you step into my level then it's face down
All I wanted was a life that I live now
All I wanted was a mic with a loud sound
And they all recognize they can see it in my eyes when the kitten come around and it's bow down, down
Sometimes I feel like I'm barely breathing, breathing
But did they tell you the reason, the reason
Sometimes I feel like I'm barely breathing, breathing
But did they tell you the reason, the reason
Sometimes I feel like I'm barely breathing, breathing
But did they tell you the reason, the reason
Sometimes I feel like I'm barely breathing, breathing
One thousand buddhas on a golden altar
With flower stems soaked in water
His focus farther from the power gem
Lotus path of true true truth is spoken all to him
Silence is a remedy of bold steadily
Scented lavender rose memories the sage strove heavily
His words are the art of old centuries composed steadily
Be the god god god god life is the complexity of stars
Like a candle in the legacy a dog can shine
Revolutionary mind like the still water
Heart like the dru-dru-dru-drum body like the mountain top
Spirit like the sun and the flames on his head annoyed
His meditation on a seven pointed mind
Training double jointed yoga spine
Amen at your crown chakra
Lotus from the ground blossom
Spoken into sound often be deceived
Syllables we bleed in the jewels
Like life on earth is just a brief interlude
Recorded in time at each interval
We've reached the pinnacles where we rest as a beacon of light
Like light all lost in those who seek in the truth
But the food of mind is unreachable
Unteachable, unspeakable
But meditation is your starship, your starship
Sometimes I feel like I'm barely breathing, breathing
But did they tell you the reason, the reason
Sometimes I feel like I'm barely breathing, breathing
But did they tell you the reason, the reason
Sometimes I feel like I'm barely breathing, breathing
But did they tell you the reason, the reason
Sometimes I feel like I'm barely breathing, breathing
Keep fighting, and though my hands so tired
Rise and I rise to lands become lions
Keep fighting, and though my hands so tired
Imma rise, Imma rise to lands become lions
Keep fighting, and though my hands so tired
Rise and I rise to lands become lions
Keep fighting, and though my hands so tired
Imma rise, Imma rise to lands become lions, lions
Sometimes I feel like I'm barely breathing, breathing
But did they tell you the reason, the reason
Sometimes I feel like I'm barely breathing, breathing
But did they tell you the reason, the reason
Sometimes I feel like I'm barely breathing, breathing
But did they tell you the reason, the reason
Sometimes I feel like I'm barely breathing, breathing
Breathing
