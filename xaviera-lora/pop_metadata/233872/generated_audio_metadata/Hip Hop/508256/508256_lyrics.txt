I know you gonna dig this
Gotta go get that dough
Get dope, get dope, ballin' out of control
Get dope, get dope, this is the way we roll
Get dope, get dope, one thing I know for sure
Get dope, get dope
I'm always down to making side money
The ducking that hide money
Get hide money soon as you make it goodbye money
The slick money, slide money
The fly money, it's kinda funny
Some players die for money
We make money, shake money
And take money, we break money
Robbing them fools that make money
Don't flash money
Cause it might be your last money
On your ass money
Taking their cash so fast
The street money, riding up deep in the Jeep money
We need money, broke ass players can't keep money
The drug money, the push come, the shove money
The thug money, go buy a mix from Chub Money
Gotta go get that dough
Get dough, get dough
Ballin' out of control
Get dough, get dough
This is the way we roll
Get dough, get dough
One thing I know for sure
I'm leaving down to making dirty money
Clean money, the mean money
Take any money, silver money
The green money, the gold money
New money, the old money
The cold money, robbing the bank
The bold money, the job money
Straight up working so hard money
The mob money make you go quick till job money
The tax money straight don't know how to act money
Watch your back money cause I'm bound to jack money
The lotto money drinking straight out the bottle money
Don't follow honey cause she sell sex for money
The pimp money, hoe money, for show money
The fast money, the slow money, the dope money
Gotta go get that dope
Get dope
Get dope
Ballin' out of control
Get dope
Get dope
This is the way we roll
Get dope
Get dope
One thing I know for sure
Get dope, get dope
They call me Mr. Wig Splitter
Doe-getter on the forilla
Hard hitter, rhyme spitter
Making you shiver
Could it be any clearer?
I'm in control of my dough
Stack for stack
N-D-Lo, he got my back
They call me Mack
Back in the days I had them stacks
But I'm done with that
Yogi tracks gon' get me back
Doing bigger things than I ever
Did before, gotta get my dough
Every show that I go
In an happy city
Full of pimps, players and hoes
Trucks on twenty-fold
You can tell we get our dough
This is how we roll
And we bout to explode
Gotta get my dough
Gotta get my dough
Gotta go get that dough
Get dough
Get dough
Ballin out of control
Get dough
Get dough
This is the way we roll
Get dope, get dope, one thing I know for sure
Get dope, get dope, gotta go get that dough
Get dope, get dope, ballin' out of control
Get dope, get dope, this is the way we roll
Get dope, get dope, one thing I know fo' sure
Get dope, get dope
