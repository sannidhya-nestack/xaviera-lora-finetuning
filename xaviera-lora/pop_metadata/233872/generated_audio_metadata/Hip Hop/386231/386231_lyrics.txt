Now if you see me on the block, best believe I'm practicing man
See me in the club, best believe I'm sipping in there
See me in the cypher, I'm controlling the flow
If you don't catch me there, I'm putting nut in your (woo)
It's prime time dude, no mood faking
Coming to this game, got the industry shaking (shaking)
We started this off with a loan on a house
Now S .I .N. is controlling the south
Prom be my name I represent the dirty dirty
Cross my path won't make it past thirty
I'm in it for the cash
I'm in it for the stash
Drunk up in the club feeling shorties on they
Gee I got a wife but you know I'm still greedy
It's the 919 like that song by B-Dag
Who be the man in the jet black Hummer
Heavy rotation hottest shit this summer
Who you represent from?
Raleigh with them thugs on cats and parties
High off the drove, stay poppin' crisp
Never been to a city like this
Where you represent from
Raleigh where the ladies keep it tight and party all night
High off the drove, stay poppin' crisp
Never been to a city like this
Now I bet you never been to a city like this
Where we stay smokin' drove, we stay poppin' crisp
We stay gettin' crunk, we stay gettin' drunk
We got everything you want, the hoes, the cash, the weed, the bars
Liquors, strippers, the clubs, the bars
See it ain't no joke down in North Carolina
Plus down here we got that good marijuana
And if you don't believe just puff the crown up at it
Pop pop pop pop go
And if you want some ass, Duke roll with Prime
I guarantee you goin' hit nothin' less than a dime
You better hide your girl before I run the hell up in her
The Philly born North Carolina represent her
Where you represent from?
Raleigh where them thugs don't gats and party
High off the drove, stay poppin' crisp
Never been to a city like this
Where you represent from?
Raleigh where the ladies keep it tight and party all night
High off the drove, stay poppin'
Chris never been to a city like this
Never been to a city like this
Never been to a city like this
And never been to a city like this
Need us at the after party
Where all the girls come and line up
And all the brothers toast their drinks up
And all my thugs light those L's up
Need us at the after party
Where all the girls come and line up
And all the brothers toast their drinks up
And all my thugs light those L's up
In your prime time
Let's show'em how we raise the roof up (let's show'em how we raise the roof up)
Let's show'em how we raise the roof, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (ay, yo, prime time)
Ay, yo, prime time
Ay, yo, prime time
