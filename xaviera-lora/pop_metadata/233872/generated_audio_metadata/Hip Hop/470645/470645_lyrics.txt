Don't let the beat stop, I wanna see your head rockin'
Beats clacking, the b-boys are body poppin'
The bass drops, yo, it sounds like a tremor
Everybody's in the club getting the vibe together
Hands in the sky, yo, we move to the floor, leave you stressin'
Unhappiness at the door, keep it funky
With a 4 /4 beat from the radio, TV screens and in the streets
So don't stop now, DJ's got the media unlocked now
Temperature's hot now, he's in the mode, there's no time to flop now
I'ma give my all, give it everything I got now
I'm like the colours in a rainbow
The way my white light just shines through a prism
Decipher sounds I'm spitting on the baseline
And our waistlines intertwined with the rhythm
Feel the beat, feel the beat, feel the beat
I make you lose control
Feel the beat, feel the beat, feel the beat
I make you lose control
Feel the beat
Feel the beat, feel the beat, I make you lose control
Feel the beat, feel the beat, feel the beat, I make you lose control
I'm back again, spitting on the track again
I'm in this game for good, I'm never packing in
I'm never lacking in the skills you're slacking in
This year's the year that it's all happening
I'm in the mode, my vibes are skyrocketing
Shut the door on the vibes, they need locking in
These kids too sick, nobody stopping them
I got a lot of talent, you weight off balance
And I'm gripping the game like bad talons
Holding on my joke with a tight grip
While the rhymes come out my throat straight through my lips
Can I deliver a sick twist of lyrics
Never mimic or spit on real gimmicks
This MC's in it just to win it
And I'm never gonna stop so you better get with it
Feel the beat, feel the beat
Feel the beat, I make you lose control
Feel the beat, feel the beat
Feel the beat, I make you lose control
Feel the beat, feel the beat
Feel the beat, I make you lose control
Feel the beat, feel the beat
Feel the beat, I make you lose control
