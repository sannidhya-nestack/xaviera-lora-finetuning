(crying)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Crazy classes of cliques and crews
All of different heritage and aptitude
To adjust to the fuck that we bust
It's a must so I got to break it down for you
Do you look to the sky?
Do you wonder what's falling?
Do you think of mankind or the block you have fallen?
Do you educate yourself?
Or you worry about your health?
Do you think before speaking? Do you listen to reason?
Do you always come hating? Are you really perpetrating?
Better check the cards you hold, these curtains will unfold
Now these crazy classes of clicks and croons
All brought together now in this room by the D .O .T.
Master of the Ceremony
You got the wrong idea, running in here
This is what we gonna do, I know you trying real hard
Deserving a award, that style ain't nothing new cause
People wanna step into the scene but why?
Everybody wanna give up why?
Yo, come on give up why?
Yo, come on give up why?
People wanna step into the scene but why?
Everybody wanna give up why?
Yo, come on, get pop-pop
Yo, come on, get pop-pop
Misunderestimated, intoxicated
Still create a style and spot like Rainy 5
You wanna get it hash? We already here
Too slow in the temple in the menso
Catch the pace, I hop a conté from San Antone
On the road again to a foreign land
Anonymous in Dallas, how I stand today
Unpredictable tomorrow in the line you follow
In the world you borrow but you thought rain
Hello, there's the truth so swallow
Choking on your ego on the dance floor
Too pushy player
She don't wanna dance no more
Don't war her, just pentangle
F***in' hostile, make the same mistakes, that's why it's been a while
My advice, switch up the style
Approach on the cool collective and call'em the Buc-Wah
You got the wrong idea, running in here, this is what we gonna do
I know you trying real hard, deserving of all that style, ain't nothing new cause
People wanna step into the scene but why?
Everybody wanna get buck wild
Yo, come on get buck wild
Yo, come on get buck wild
People wanna step into the scene but why?
Everybody wanna get buck wild
Yo, come on get buck wild
Yo, come on, give'em what they got (come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)
Who they (uh) sides, fought the whole night
Wouldn't be rappin' if it all would go right
So tight, clientele shady
Just a bunch of thugs with no ladies
So maybe you would see
But it seem like y'all ain't got a clue to me
Lose your steam, it ain't that hard
we ain't in jail and this ain't the yard
You paranoid, won't even dance
It'd be funny if that toy got off in your pants
Check your safety, I bet you hate me
I accept that your beat is greedy
Just know if your pride is punctured
That you probably that same damned up herd
One word, enough, I had it
Then I keep moving on without the baggage
You got the wrong idea, running in here, this is what we gonna do
I know you trying real hard, deserve an award, that style ain't nothing new
people wanna step into the scene but why?
Everybody wanna get bucked, why?
Yo, come on, get bucked, why? (Yeah)
Yo, come on, get bucked, why (Yeah)
People wanna step into the scene but why (Why?)
Everybody wanna get bucked, why (Yeah)
Yo, come on, get bucked, why (Buck, buck)
Yo, come on, get bucked, why (Buck, buck)
