Sometimes I feel like the world's against me
So where do we go when it's finally ending
I gotta know can't somebody help me
Are we for real or are we just pretending
9, 8, 1981 I didn't pass through the gates handpicked from above
Mommy's little mistake kept her out the 12th grade now it'll never be the same
Just give me my name and send me on my way
Before I go could you tell me what I need to know
In order to survive cause in this world today is do or die
Plus my family's not an ally I'm growing solo changing like a promo
Started out a mama's boy my tools were toys
Dad's voice just a memory in a fertile mind
Something I've come to understand
In due time, but for now I'm just standing in line
With the rest of the youth, so confused, unaware of the truth
Even abused by the ones we love
No wonder we suicidal, all hooked on drugs
Trapped in a cycle
Sometimes I feel like the world's against me (world's against me)
So where do we go when it's finally ending (when it's finally ending)
I gotta know can somebody help me
Are we for real or are we just pretending
Trekking the trail of life and I'm feeling myself
A little too much life lessons as a teen
Living in the lap of luxury
Safe neighborhoods under mom's custody
Luckily she trusted me at a early age
I was the man of the house she worked nights
So I was out and about trying to be a big boy
And be cool, but cool's just a decoy
Don't be fooled, you gotta learn fast
Never make the same mistakes, so pump your brakes
One second's all it takes to make a change
For better or worse, bless the curse
The truth hurts, it always works in the end
Let's begin another chapter, once a slacker
Now I'm gonna be a factor, I motivate while I demonstrate
We'll take the stairs'cause I'm tryna help us elevate, come on
Sometimes I feel like the world's against me
So where do we go when it's finally ending?
I gotta know, can somebody help me? (I need help, y'all)
Are we for real or are we just pretending? (Just pretending)
I finally found my place, the world is out of order
It's getting colder, gotta keep my composure
Moving at the speed of light, enjoying sounds and sights
Kinda hard when they take my rights, you know the type
Politics all hype, could care less about the truth
Yeah I'm picking a fight, and who the fuck
Fuck's got my back, time to rise or fall through the cracks
Created by lies, I'm a leader for the last chance
Built to last, I'm here to advance
To get my people out the trance
A fortune in fame, this life in a game
That's real talk, something to gain
Use your brain, where do we go from here?
Find your way out the shadows
My heart scarred from battle with love and hate
I find time to meditate, I'm gaining strength
So I could bend the record straight
Sometimes I feel like the world's against me
So where do we go when it's finally ending?
I gotta know can somebody help me (I need help y'all)
Are we for real or are we just pretending
Sometimes I feel like the world's against me (world's against me)
So where do we go when it's finally ending (when it's finally ending)
I gotta know can somebody help me
Are we for real or are we just pretending
