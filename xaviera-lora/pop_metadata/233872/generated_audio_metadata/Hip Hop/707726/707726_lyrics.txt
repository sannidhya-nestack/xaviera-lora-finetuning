Back that ass up
Back that ass up
Back that ass up, back that ass up
First of all, girl I'm a freak
And I know you want,'cause you're here with me
You got a pretty face, and a fat old ass
And a small waist, I slow stroke it for the first half
Then I beat it up, just the way you like it
You can put it in your mouth girl, but just don't bite it
You're so excited cause this is so explicit
Yeah triple X now let's switch positions
Kissing you from the front then flip you to the side
We can smoke this blunt girl while I watch you ride
Girl you're so sexy especially when you cum
The faces that you're making you're shaking making a nigga strong
I wanna use my tongue, now let's hop in the shower
I got this room for the rest of the night not just a couple of hours
Yeah multiples, I see you bustin' em girl
I'm still workin' on my verse but I really don't mind a tussle girl but
I'm tired of doin' all the work
Back that ass up, now let me lift your mini skirt
Back that ass up, I wanna stand against the wall
Back that ass up, because I know that you's a freak
Back that ass up, now gonna give it to a G
Back that ass up, I like to watch you do your thing
Back that ass up, I love to hear you scream my name
Back that ass up
Round two, girl you're so wet
It's like the more I beat it up
The more we dripping sweat
Tattoos on the back
With a tongue ring
And a fat camel toe
Like a Twinkie she's filled with cream
This ain't no quickie
And it ain't romance
I just really love hitting it
Like a stripper loves to dance
Jump in the Jacuzzi
You hear the clapping sound
Like B .B .B just threw me for the kitty cat
I'm a bloodhound
It's like a treasure I found
So I'ma keep on digging, when you come I like to pound it (pound it)
Damn, you somebody's missus (missus)
With your mind at night (night), and you feel so tight (tight)
If fucking you is wrong, I don't wanna be right (right)
Yeah, multiples, I see you bustin'em, girl (girl)
Time to bust my second nut, I swear this feel so perfect, girl (girl)
Yeah, take this pipe
With your thick ass thighs I'm tired I'm starting to feel like I'm working a 9 to 5
So I'm tired of doing all the work
Back that ass up
Now let me lift your mini skirt
Back that ass up
I wanna stand against the wall
Back that ass up
Do it all, back that ass up
Because I know that you's a freak
Back that ass up
Not gonna give it to a G
Back that ass up
I like to watch you do your thing
Back that ass up
I love to hear you scream my name
Back that ass up
It's three AM, and three's a John
I got that missile, but you got that bomb
You a nemfo, that license get stretched out
Like a porno video, you want me to squirt it in your mouth
You say you're my beast and I promise I'm a peach for sleeps
I should call you Rain Woman, baby girl look how you read up the sheets
Yeah, that's your spot
So let me bang, and I know by now like Tray Songz bet the neighbors know my name
By tomorrow you gonna be feeling sore
Every time you think I'm done I keep coming right back for more
You like it slow, then you like it fast
You should work for an escort service girl you be making that cash
Your best friend, she be looking fine too
Maybe next time we can do a threesome if you're willing to do it
Yeah multiples, I see you bustin'em girl
But it's almost check out time so I really don't mean to rush you girl but
I'm tired of doing all the work (back that ass up)
Now let me lift your mini skirt (back that ass up)
I wanna stand against the ball (back that ass up)
Back that ass up, because I know that you's a freak
Back that ass up, not gonna give it to a G
Back that ass up, I like to watch you do your thing
Back that ass up, I love to hear you scream my name
Back that ass up, I want you, you want me
