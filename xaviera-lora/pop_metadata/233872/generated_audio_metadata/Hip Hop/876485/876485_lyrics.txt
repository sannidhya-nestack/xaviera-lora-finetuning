Hey girl you thinking of something but he sees you as nothing but a five minute
He doesn't want to think with you girl
You someone they hate on still want others do celebrate on
Put your cake spade and your tiny face and your pretty face on
Put your mace on cartoon y'all in Paris freight drums
And you shaking that shaking that ping like you never did girl you'll wake up aching
And it's so amazing you're finally rewarded
To see them cute legs expand for the bands girl I find that appalling
You got your IG up, your DM's up but your ego is falling
Falling, crawling, ain't you tired of calling for the ball who'll bounce like a Spalding?
Who you tryna impress? Yes, I can just bet
You thinking your best gotta be stressed from under a evening dress
There's no context especially when you know that you're blessed
Even in the permanent press nevertheless it's so hard to miss
Something about you so natural
Actually way past passable
Why won't you walk in the club like you walk in a zoo
Then be cool with them animals
Pushin' on pushers to get put on
First up like a Catherine Aragon
Enough to bag some bucks she stuck in a swagathon
This be the deal, this be the deal, go-o-o-o-o-o
Keepin' it real, keepin' it real, go-o-o-o-o
You cannot get, you cannot get, go-o-o-o-o
Into my head, into my world, go-o-o-o-o
This be the deal, this be the deal, go-o-o-o-o
Keepin' it real, keepin' it real, go-o-o-o-o
You cannot get, you cannot get, go-o-o-o-o
Into my head, into my world, go-o-o-o-o
He doesn't wanna thing with you girl
Doesn't wanna be same with you girl
Hey girl you thinking of something
But he see she wears nothing but a five minute
He doesn't want to play with you, girl
Sooner or later, he gon' see through the makeup
Straight up, do the panty probe, he activate a actuator
Soon as he wake up, raise up to your human nature
Better take, take, take your card to the mall for your loser relation, later
In every occasion, beauty is not obligation, it's participation
Round and round in every rotation, time to put your heart on vacation
That place I've granted clay vacant, move on to one new situation
We single-edged, and girl, here is your congratulations
Girl, et the drama, I'm just quoting your mama
Get the outside view for yourself, girl, here's the panorama
Your hunger and for it and an applaud is just a forsaken facade
We tend to et that our early concept of the image of God
So abandon the arm candy mentality lift up your ante
Beyond the stars know who you are girl you're more than a fanny
You got to make'em all explore through every nook and cranny
And set yourself on fire to take more more more than they hand me
This feeling real, this feeling real, girl
Keeping it real, keeping it real, girl
You can not get, you can not get, girl
Into my head, into my world, girl
This feeling real, this feeling real
You can not get, you can not get, go-o-o-o-o-o-o
Into my head, into my world, go-o-o-o-o
This be the real, this be the real, go-o-o-o-o-o
Keep it a real, keep it a real, go-o-o-o-o-o
You can not get, you can not get, go-o-o-o-o-o
Into my head, into my world, go-o-o-o-o-o
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Keepin' it real, keepin' it real
Girl, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
You can not get, you can not get
Girl, uh-uh-uh-uh -uh-uh
Into my head, into my world
Girl, uh-uh-uh-uh-Uh-uh
This been a deal, this been a deal
And it doesn't wanna thing with you
Keepin' it real, keepin' it real
Girl, uh-uh-uh-uh-ah-ah
You can not get, you can not get
Doesn't wanna be thing with you
Into my head, into my world
Girl, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Hey girl you thinking of something but he sees you as nothing but a five minute
He doesn't wanna play with you girl
