This is for the fans, this is for the love, to everybody who's supporting what our culture does, this is hip hop, this is hip hop, music for the world, we gonna lift off, this is for the fans, this is for the love to everybody who's supporting what our culture does, this is hip hop
This is hip hop, music for the world
You know we gonna live, die
I'm on another level, they call me skyscraper
Making classic songs, now I'll rewind later
My divine nature will never annihilate you
Spreading love in an industry that designs haters
Watch my rhymes take you into a mental canvas
Not a filler in this verse, no dental planning
My life's been getting heavy
I'm undressing a man that's trying to find respect
And I feel that I'm destined to have it
Been blessed and I'm thanking the most high
A man with both eyes seeing clearly, vanity so blind
Rap is a gas at the factor getting cosigned
Feel like calling him out but I'm hanging up the phone lines
Cause I know I'm looking for a better future
When the world knows you're great and the best salute ya
Learning lessons in this game
As I test maneuvers ready for the fame
So I'm hoping that success is sooner
This is for the fans, this is for the love
To everybody who's supporting what our culture does
This is hip hop, this is hip hop
Music for the world, we gonna lift off
This is for the fans, this is for the love
To everybody who's supporting what our culture does
This is hip hop, this is hip hop
Music for the world, you know we gonna lift off
I'm on another level, they call me Game Ender
Hip Hop, cream of the crop, you can't make me better
Time to clean house, this ain't a break and enter
Gold on my mind, flowing these rhymes, my brain is treasure
Not tryna change the weather, learning to dance in rain
Hoping I'm recognized, searching the path of fame
Working hard for what I plan to gain, but as long as I love what I do
I'll do it even earning half the pay
Mind candy ways has gotten credible
Cause time heals everything my inner clocks are medical
Used to be a child now a hip hop intellectual
Slapping hands have a glance my team rocking festivals
These thoughts are several and never running dry
Y'all can't hold me down like someone who can fly
What will I choose to rhyme the beat is do or die
So if I don't say this now imma lose my mind
This is for the fans this is for the love
To everybody who's supporting what our culture does
This is hip hop, this is hip hop
Music for the world, we gonna lift off
This is for the fans, this is for the love
To everybody who's supporting what our culture does
This is hip hop
This is hip hop, music for the world
You know we gonna live y'all
I'm on another level, two floors higher
Every step that I take proves the Lord inspires
Cause when the flames out, my hope restores the fire
Came out the womb screaming, I was born a fighter
Now I'm bored and tired following the new scene, there's no truth
We should swallow what we do need
We're stealing time and we're borrowing a routine
We gotta be different cause then tomorrow we will lose dreams
No educators, no in the bed of how to's
Just entertainers, promoting empty values
So my passion has been set controlling many taboos
It's forever in my heart my soul's been getting tattoos
Flowing rap truth so people can relate with this
The world is changing slow me I wanna change it quick
Cause hip hop new school sometimes makes me sick
I wanna earthquake the industry and shake the biz
This is for the fans
This is for the love
To everybody who supporting what our culture does
This is hip hop
This is hip hop
Music for the world
We gonna lift off
This is for the fans
This is for the love
To everybody who supporting what our culture does
This is hip hop
This is hip hop, music for the world
You know we gonna lift off
This is for the fans, this is for the love
To everybody who's supporting what our culture does
This is hip hop, this is hip hop
Music for the world, we gonna lift off
This is for the fans, this is for the love
To everybody who's supporting what our culture does
This is hip hop, this is hip hop
Music for the world, you know we gonna lift off
