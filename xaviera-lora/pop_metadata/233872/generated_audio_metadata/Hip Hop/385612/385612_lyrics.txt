You ready for the throwdown
Girlies on the floor, dropping that, but don't collect lowdown
Wait'til they get a load of me
I'ma hit'em so hard, make'em buckle to they knees, G
Honey sweating in the club
All the real G's shouting, "Bow's up," giving much love
For those who want her hate
I got something that's heavy and it'll make you throw up what you ate
But I keep it on the hush tip
In case the sucker wanna pop that lil' up
Me and my crew we roll too deep
Don't make me treat you like a child
Slap you in your mouth, G
So turn up that bang
This is something for the club
That'll make'em wanna tear it up, man
Ain't nothing like that

Show'em we know how to act
So run and grab your girl
Swing your head and then
Do the cherry curl
Take her to the floor
Get low, get low, get low, get real low
You know how we do it
Sweat jumpin' and hollin'
Just yo goin' through it
I know y'all feel me
And when the night is over
You take somethin' home, see
Haters gon' hate me
But you know what that mean
I gotta get trigger happy
But I'm gonna take it light on ya
I won't take her to the crib
Lay her down and put the light on up
But you better keep her in check
if she acts again
I can't tell you what'll happen next
Bones up in the club

Ain't no thang for me, I got it
You can bring your friends
Touch your toes and wobble for me
It's like, throw it as far as eyes can see, alright?
All you haters don't get mad at me
she went up and down in my SUV
I want you to keep me hoppin' like the Yin Yang Twins
I'ma hit it once then I'm comin' again
So uh, sit back and sip
Don't trip, enjoy the view
As they wobble them hips, I want you to keep me hot like the Ying Yang twins
Cause I'ma hit it once and I'm coming again
So uh, sit back and sip, don't trip, enjoy the view
As they wobble them hips, like the preacher
I'ma pray for you cause uh, you been blessed and you know what to do when you shake it
I can feel the heat but we gon' keep the door open
And heat up the streets and cover cheap, let'em in, don't hold'em back
Hit the bar, bought it out, Moet in a six pack
What can you do with that?
Now the radio is broadcasting live from where we at
Too many cuties in here,'cause we can't get a break
Throwin' hundreds, don't look and hate
Get you all blamed out, it ain't nothin' to me
Take you to the car lot, how you an SUV?
5Gs in your tummy
Wine and dine you and you can wake up next to me
All this could be yours so you can roll with a winner or walk with them boys
