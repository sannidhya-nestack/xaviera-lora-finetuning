Ayy, boy, it's finna get lit (yeah)
Ooh, I'm in here to do that, uh-huh
From the struggle to the stars, we're still rising
Gotta keep the faith through the storms and the silence
Through it all
I been dreaming I been working through the nights (through the nights)
Tryna turn this pain into light (into light)
Every law just taught me how to fight (how to fight)
I know my moment gon' come in time
Gotta keep the faith, yeah, keep it alive (keep it alive)
Even when the tears fall, I still survive (still survive)
One day I'ma make it, I feel it inside (feel it inside)
I just keep believing, that's how I fly (that's how I fly)
Used to pray with my back to the wall (to the wall)
Now I stand tall when the pressure calls (stand tall)
No sleep, just dreams on the line (on the line)
Isn't it my soul, can't let it die (can't let it die)
Came from the dirt where the whole fell down (fell down)
I see light where the pain had been
Every scar is a story that made me grow
Every fall taught me what I know
I been dreaming I been working through the night
Trying to turn this pain into light
Every law just taught me how to fight
I know my moment gon' come in time
Gotta keep the faith, yeah, keep it alive (keep it alive)
Even when the tears fall, I still survive (still survive)
One day I'ma make it, I feel it inside (feel it inside)
I just keep believin', that's how I fly (that's how I fly)
Sometimes the road feel too long to see (too long)
But I still chase what's meant for me (meant for me)
Got people doubtin', but that's alright (that's alright)
My faith too strong, I don't need they sight (no)
Every note just push me harder to win (to win)
Every door closed I find one again (again)
The dream don't sleep and neither do I (do I)
I'm tryna reach God with my hands to the sky (sky)
Keep your head up when the nights get cold (get cold)
Don't lose your heart, don't say a soul (soul)
Every step slow still gets you there (you get there)
You just need faith and a little prayer (ooh yeah)
Fire burning bright (burn bright)
The dark don't last when you walk with light
I've been dreaming, I've been working through the night (through the night)
Trying to turn this pain into light (into light)
Every loss has taught me how to fight (how to fight)
I know my moment gon' come and come, gotta keep the faith
Keep it alive (keep it alive)
Even when the tears fall I still survive (still survive)
One day I'ma make it I feel it inside (feel it inside)
I just keep believing that's how I fly (that's how I fly)

We gon' shine someday, someday
Fate over fear
That's our only way
