Uh, yeah, witness the king rise, yeah
J Nolan
Humble beginners make for a happy ending
I started out in the red
Now I'm attractive business
You had to witness it
Something greater done grabbed me
Took me out of the traps
In the wilderness where they had me
I'm happy and feeling classy
Gladly I'm representing
Ascending into the light
I'm like Benjamin with the kite right
Experimenting with new flows and cadence
Take it into the party
DJ's rushing to play it
I'm saying who gone stop me
You can bring out your posse, I'm Rocky rockin' Cavalli
With partners out in the Rockies, you sloppy, not on my level
Check your treble and bass, you got it mixed like a mulatto
I ain't checkin' your race, I'm runnin' mine
Laced up, takin' it to the pavement, courageous
Fightin' for my life to make a statement, amazing
Used to wanna be seen on the basement
Now I'm sensin' victory, close enough I can
Rise above the hate, boy I'm on another plane
I wake up in the morning and I'm going for the ring
I could do anything if I put my mind to it
I could do anything when I put my mind to it
Rise above the hate, boy I'm on another plane
I wake up in the morning and I'm going for the ring
I could do anything if I put my mind to it
I could do anything when I put my mind to it
When I put my mind to it
One of the only ones to see the vision
Read the statistics, my city stuck in needy conditions
Need you to listen, yo I'm set to increase my position
While you plan, I'm making plans to proceed with the mission
Taking meetings to make immediate waves
Maybe a ripple in your eyes, but to me it's a change
They tried to match me, tax me, take me out like a taxi
But little did they know my soul caliber's high as maxi
Drasty, channel my rage into the page, let it go
Now I'm willing to say that I'm not afraid, let'em know
I'm standing here waiting for the opposition
I'm looking right in your face like this the competition?
Gotta be kidding, why you pulling my leg?
Anybody that's doubting it's time to put it to bed
People tell me to rest but I can sleep when I'm dead
They just want me to stop cause they coming short with the
Rise above the hate boy I'm on another plane
I wake up in the morning and I'm going for the ring
I can do anything if I put my mind to it
I can do anything when I put my mind to it
Rise above the hate boy I'm on another plane
I wake up in the morning and I'm going for the ring
I can do anything if I put my mind to it
I can do anything when I put my mind to it
My mind to it, photo ops for flies and photoshop (swag)
I'm the prototype designed by the polo shop, uh (swag)
Word to my mama, gotta defer from the drama
Excellence is the goal, I'm focusin' on my honor (woah)
I opened up, to be honest, I'm removin' that veil
Droppin' some jewels, you would think I did my school in that Yale (okay)
I moved to prevail, and sawin' parents shoot for the sale
Ironically, I used to cop my parents' shoes from the sales (tell'em)
Usin' the trail that was paid for me
Back in the days, used to datin', shorties paid for me
You know the times when you was looking out the window when you wish you could leave
Seven years old on punishment and your friends in the street
Well that was me, restricted but self inflicted, vindictive
Closed minded and tried but couldn't turn on the engine
Borderline defensive and couldn't keep up attention
Gradually got apprenticed and now I'm crossing the line
Rise above the hate boy I'm on another plane
I wake up in the morning and I'm going for the ring
I can do anything if I put my mind to it
I can do anything when I put my mind to it
Rise above the hate boy I'm on another plane
I wake up in the morning and I'm going for the ring
I can do anything if I put my mind to it
I can do anything when I put my mind to it
When I rise above the hate boy I'm on another plane
I wake up in the morning and I'm going for the ring
I can do anything if I put my mind to it
I can do anything when I put my mind to it
Rise above the hate boy I'm on another plane
I wake up in the morning and I'm going for the ring
I can do anything if I put my mind to it
I can do anything when I put my mind to it
When I put my mind to it
