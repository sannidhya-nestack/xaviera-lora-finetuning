Sipping on joints, time in a bottle
Memories caught, echoes out the floor
Last dated like a misty night
Chase'em down, raise the sunlight
Tripping through life, old Polaroid snap
Moments that crack, a grin, no cap
Pages flipping, ink slope to brown
Holding you tight, never lend your charms
Sisters in the wind, shadows play
Heartbeats sync with the break of day
Stumble, fall, gotta stand tall
In the gallery of moments I recall
Sipping on dreams, time in a bottle
Memories caught, echoes of the throttle
Laughs faded like a misty night
Chase'em down, rays of sunlight
Tripping through life, old Polaroid snap
Moments that crack, a grin, no cap
Pages flipping, ink slope to brown
Hold me tight, never let me drown
Sipping through life, old Polaroid snap
Moments that crack, a grin, no cap
Pages slip and make slope brown
Hold me tight, never let me drown
Heart beats in the baseline
Echoes through time, every rhyme
Sip of dreams, life's fine wine
Pages turn but the past still shines
