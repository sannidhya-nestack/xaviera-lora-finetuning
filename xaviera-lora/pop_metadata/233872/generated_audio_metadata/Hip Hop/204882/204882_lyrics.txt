Growing up down south of course I've seen hustlers
Been around busters they all shared tears
My dad had the speakers in the yard when I came home from school
Damn I love living right here
Y'all rap cats take our slang do dances
You know who you are you taking too many chances
No second glances
No time to play we need radio spins
Cause we just pouring it straight
Burning your throat when you mention my state
Texas lone star the flag has to wave
We got more than little flippin' scar face
Don't isolate exposure it's a big place
This ain't a small sack dawg this is big weight
The labels in a bidding war it's a big day
The big payback each wax these kids played
512 we doin' it all day cuz (nothing) cuz (nothing)
Connecticut (I stay the same forever)
But for what? (No nothing living)
(I never stay the same)
Y'all gotta recognize (nothing) nothing (I'll stay the same forever)
The 512 (nah, nothing) kinetic (I'll forever stay the same)
I celebrate Juneteenth style block the corners
Parade each avenue
Filmed by reporters
Hood must support us
Them boys is hot
The good gets rewarded
Bass gets distorted
Them boys can box
I stand for my city
Either you run scared
Or you come and stand with me
Catch'em your mans dizzy
From a flurry of moves
From my mix take material
Mode younger dudes
Respect hunger moves
I grind like it shoulda been
If not then you'll never know what you coulda been
Say A &R can we slide for a minute
Come hop up in the cruiser let's ride for a minute
Absorb this newness that I have invented
Oh where's your contract oh I haven't sent it why not
Not enough zeros up in it
Connecticut joint ventures gotta put my folks in it
Cause nothing I stay the same forever
The new Texas no nothing living I never stay the same
Nothing, brand new, I stay the same forever
The 512, no nothing living, never stay the same
Peace to Teddy Lee, peace out to Kaz
If you ain't from'round here, you don't know about that
Back when Army Man was an underground smash
Back when KB and IC had wax
Back when Candy Fresh hooked up with 2Live
Papa Chuck got signed and he got a little light
And the fellas had Doris Miller every other night
When dollars flipped, speed bumps, yeah that was tight
Run DMC on Loyola that's right
See it's hard to summarize, thank God I have sight
Cause I've seen growth, expansion, I flow like a champion
Giving out plaques, hand them ten
Burn requests, lines, demand them then
Play street heaters composed by these leaders
Cause when I came through to 512
That's the city, this is Texas and it's all new
The new Texas, you know, you know, you know
I stay the same forever
The 512
No, nothing to lose, never stay the same
The New Texas, yo, kinetic (you know, there's nothing)
I'll stay the same forever
No, I'm not
