Get your back up off the wall
I'm just, I'm just vibin' with it
I'm just feelin' it
I'm just, check it
Yo, we spent like two hours getting prepared
Settin' up
Weeks practicin' to make sure we're not messin' up
No matter if it's a club party or warehouse
We wild or fuck out
Get stupid, throw the chance out
Sittin' is prohibited
You spend money on a drink and you won't even finish it
I never heard of this
When I get a drink you know damn well I'm slurpin' it
Till it's dry at the bottom
Fake heads yo I spot'em
With the quickness, you miss my show cause you talking to too many bitches
Too cool to dance, and you wonder why chicks on the dance floor don't give up they number
It's cause they doing what they came to do, trying hard, looking lame with your crew
Hip hop squad, pay my money at the door, you silly dressed clowns ain't funny anymore
So what the fuck did you come for?
The cheap bid, the weed, some dumb whore
You taking up space, and I tell you to your face
If you ain't here to party then the party's just a waste
What the fuck did you come for?
The cheap bid, the weed, some dumb whore
You taking up space, and I tell you to your face
And I tell you to your face, if you ain't in a party then the party's just a waste
See I get frustrated sometimes when I step into a new scene
Everybody lined up single file lead
Across the wall as if they move they just might fall
Into the fat funk we play and they absorb
So I guess that's why I like to play outside
Players with no rhythm got nowhere to hide
From the fat funk we create and you consume
That's why you see these people stand in the middle of the room
Figgity funky flowing on their hands knees and heads
Hollin' back dot matrix that's what they said
There is no need to put a pause on what the hell I'm doing
I got to keep pursuing
I got to keep on grooving
What the fuck did you come for?
The cheap beer
The weed
Some dumb whore
You taking up space
Y'all when I tell you to your face
If you ain't here to party
Then the party's just a waste
What the fuck did you come for?
The cheap piss, the weed, some dumb whore
You taking up space
Y'all when I tell you to your face
If you ain't here to party
Then the party's just a waste
Ladies, you thought you got away scot-free
Seduced by the rhymes of this yellow poppy, that's not me
After a show sweating hard, thanks for the props
My best regards, it's all like an offer
You like a bad author, always the same story
Just cause I came alone don't mean I came horny
No you can't call me, your mom got commitments
If no one found out it still wouldn't make a difference
Besides, I don't fuck around with flaky bitches
I came to do a show, I didn't come to pursue a hoe
So, you don't need to come perfume and made up
We gon' let the music play, babe, and blaze up
Shit, throw your elbows
I wanna see women with corn braids and shell toes
Giving peace and death instead of hellos
In the front row with all the rowdy fellows, like
So what the fuck did you come for?
The cheap beer? The weed? Some dumb whore?
You taking up space?
And I tell you to your face, if you ain't here to party then the party's just a waste
What the fuck did you come for?
The cheap beer, the weed, some dumb whore
You taking up space
And I tell you to your face, if you ain't here to party then the party's just a waste
My frustration comes, yes, from mad interruption
Somebody from that wall is causing a disruption
Want to solve it with no verbal discussion
So I grab this microphone and it's my turn to butt
With a little tiny dabble of this microphone scrabble
Leave all these MC's heads back and rattling
Guess there's just one thing left for you
It's the funky fly sound
It's the dot matrix crew
What the fuck did you come for?
The cheap end, the weed, some dumb whore
You taking up space
And I tell you to your face if you ain't here to party then the party's just a waste
What the fuck did you come for?
The cheap beer, the weed, some dumb whore
You taking up space
And I tell you to your face if you ain' here to party then the party's just a waste
Then the party's just a waste
Then the party's just a what
How you gonna do it if you really don't wanna dance
By standing on the wall
Get your back up off the wall
How you gonna do it if you really don't wanna dance
By standing on the wall
Get your back up off the wall
Come on get your back up off
How you gonna do it if you really don't wanna dance
By standing on the wall
Get your back up off the wall
Get your back up off the wall
