Just have a good time (time, time, time, time, time, time, time)
Just have a good time (time, time, time, time, time, time)
Sometimes life might get you
But tonight we're gonna let it go and get loose
Everybody have fun, everybody get drunk
Let's fly through the town like jets do
I wanna roll downtown in my best suit
I just wanna stand out like Alex Coupe
Without a care in the world for just one night
I don't care if the world comes to an end right now
Who cares, everybody dance
People on the floor, put your hands in the air
Hands in the sky,'cause I feel fly
I just wanna leave all my worries behind
Everybody shine, have a good time
Wish I could stay like this my whole life
DJ keep this bumpin all night
I never felt so alive
Get the world I'm having such a good time
And I just wanna let you know that tonight was incredible
I danced all night without a care in my mind
Tonight we're gonna shine
So everyone just have a good time
Everything is going fine
So just have a good time
Just leave all your cares behind and just have a good time
Free your soul and close your mind and just have a good time
Everything here is alright so just have a good time
Everything is going fine so just have a good time
Just leave all your cares behind and just have a good time
Free your soul and close your mind and just have good time
Everything here is alright
I see everything around me, I'm so fly
I don't ever want this moment to go by
Man, it might be all I have, so I do it like NASA
You never hit the moon if you don't try
See, I will not sit alone waiting to die
I am not dead yet, I am alive
Everybody dance and have a good time
Let's party like it's 1999, people, let's go
Everybody move, ladies and gentlemen, get in the groove
Live in the melody, everything's cool
Tonight I'm gonna try to break every rule
Or build a brick wall and nothing's gonna move it
I refuse to let anything through
Now put up your hands and dance to the music
I had a good time and I hope you did too
Everybody shine, have a good time
Wish I could stay like this my whole life
DJ keep this bumpin all night
I never felt so alive
I danced all night without a care in my mind
Tonight we're gonna shine
So everyone just have a good time
Everything is going fine
So just have a good time
Just leave all your cares behind and just have a good time
Free your soul and close your mind and just have a good time
Everything here is alright so just have a good time
Everything is going fine so just have a good time
Just leave all your cares behind and just have a good time
Free your soul and close your mind and just have good time
Everything here is alright
Just have a good time
Free your soul and close your mind
Just have a good time
Everything here is alright
