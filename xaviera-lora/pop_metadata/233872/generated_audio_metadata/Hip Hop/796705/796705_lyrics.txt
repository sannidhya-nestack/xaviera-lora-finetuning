Fly through the city you with me we living the moment
Tell me you want it I got it it's on me so don't trip
Life is about what you make it and you make it so lit
Life is about what you make it and you make it so lit

Break the bank tonight my jet break the bank tonight
Fly through the city you with me we living the moment

Break the bank tonight, my jet break the bank tonight
Break the bank tonight, my jet break the bank tonight
Life is about what you make it and you make it so lit
Life is about what you make it and you make it so lit
Sitting in the coupe, visualizing millions
I can see it so clear I can touch it I'm in my feelings
And we keep the best smoke
Jet light blow good coast to coast
She wanna see the world and I'm her host
Selfies for the book and gram the post
Oh she bad too, short thick and profile too
Wait to find throw lines at too many tribes that she been lied to
She gotta guard up she in the zone so
Oh if I can't drive I step back and whip a three four
Steph Curry, Kyrie Irving on the East Coast
She made me a promise she wanna be down, she wanna be mine
So let's head out of town, Cooper we flying, Whippa be fine
See I'm taking my time, and it's weak in you mind
And I say it's just to get to know you girl but I swear I be lying
She like boy you weight too much, I'm like you ain't seen enough
In Memphis we on Beale Street, LA it's wheels up
I'm feeling good, got a pocket full, I blow it all
It's plenty more in this bank card, let's hit the mall and
Fly through the city, you with me, we living the moment
Tell me you want it, I got it, it's on me, so don't trip
Life is about what you make it and you make it so lit
Life is about what you make it and you make it so lit
Break the bank tonight
My jet break the bank tonight
Break the bank tonight
My jet break the bank tonight
Fly through the city you with me we living the moment
Tell me you want it I got it it's on me so don't trip
Break the bank tonight
My jet break the bank tonight
Break the bank tonight
My jet break the bank tonight
Life is about what you make it and you make it so lit
Life is about what you make it and you make it so lit
Lil mama you rollin
I see you decidin
No worries you hangin with us tonight
And know that we ridin
See I been workin OT
And I'm usually low key
But tonight it's nothin but two cups
Backwoods and OG
A musical bandit
Livin my life through the keys
So when I leave I feel at ease
Done what I want and I live how I please
Stood on my feet but I prayed on my knees
Got your attention now be at ease
On my guard some of them spares down
Flip, must be the weed, wait
I get a shit like that
Spin it, watch it come right back
Don't do the clubs, don't do no drugs
But I'm in love with the loud pack
Ain't gotta ask what a loud ass
She get in, hit it, laid back
I looked in her eyes, saw she was high
Put it in drive and made tracks
Say I'm a genius, she meanest
She hooked on my magic
She caught in my spell, cushioned my L
She fallin' as fast as the ashes
I got the woods
All you need is the matches
Tonight is a movie
And we shooting the classic out
Break the bank tonight
My jet break the bank tonight
Break the bank tonight
My jet break the bank tonight
Fly through the city you with me we living the moment
Tell me you want it, I got it, it's on me so don't trip
Break the bank tonight, my jet break the bank tonight
Break the bank tonight, my jet break the bank tonight
Life is about what you make it and you make it so lit
Life is about what you make it and you make it so lit
