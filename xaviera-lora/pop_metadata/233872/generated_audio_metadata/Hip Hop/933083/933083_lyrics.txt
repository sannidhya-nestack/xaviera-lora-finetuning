Yo
We need exposure for soldiers ending up homeless
I know this we gotta potus they never think that he owe us
The feeling of being hopeless I focus here go my opus
The dopest before I wrote this I might be a Mike Moses
God willing I'll make a million don't see a ceiling
In a billion a trillion of money so appealing
I'm feeling I'm tired billing I'm working while you be chilling
I'm killing willing and dealing to save it for all my children
Use Twitter to speak
We saw the players take a knee
And the fans would leave seats
And the news is full of leaks
And the Weinstein is a freak
And he treated women like meat
And the shame is cutting deep
All capital stay wanting collateral
Compatible to live with these lies
I won't be after you
Adaptable to blow any moment
It's more than practical
It's factual
To sedate these haters
Love in the reddit queue
Too many guns in the schools
While the president is on a vacation
With ocean views
Tax money abused
Couple of interviews
Harassments on the rise
Surprise and it was you
I took a breather for a moment, I'm sizing up the opponent
I own it, homie, you know it, a poet soon to be stoic
I'm witty, hella heroic, my drive feeling ferocious
I'm never stopping, so quote it, yes
Sick of rappers saying nothing, they mumble a little something
The basslines are bumpin', the adlibs are better than verses
In the discussion, I'm hard without the cuts
And my love comes by the dozen
Russia got us in a bind, we tried drummin' the line
But Trump said, "Never mind," his election was a joke
Or a hoax of the third kind
From Manning Ford to Gates, y'all doin' some hard time
I'm lost in all the topics, life is like the comics
Good and evil profits, generating the profits
Man it's all logic, dreams of seeing Africa looking like it's the tropics
I'm out of my mind
Always on time
I deliver these lines
Like I'm riding on a wave
Wave okay okay
Don't tell me to stop it
I'll be changing the topic
I'm out of my mind
Always on time
I deliver these lines
Like I'm riding on a wave
Wave okay okay
Don't tell me to stop it
I'll be changing the topic
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind
Losing my mind trying to show you
I'm here for nothing but the truth
Losing my mind, losing my mind
Losing my mind to show you
I'm here for nothing but the truth
I'm out of my mind, always on time
I deliver these lines like I'm riding on a wave, wave, okay, okay
Don't tell me to stop it, I'll be changing the topic
I'm out of my mind, always on time
I deliver these lines like I'm riding on a wave, wave, okay, okay
Don't tell me to stop it, I'll be changing the topic
