Super smooth, bass groove under city lights
Drifting through the misty avenues of endless nights
Piano keys, rain drops on otten streets
Chilling in the hum lost in the heartbeat of beats
Velvet sky, saxophone whispers secrets low
Spillin' sly, confessions in that mellow glow
Wine glasses clink, stories told with every sip
Her laughter melody got me catchin' every drip
She jazzes me up more than caffeine in my cup
Dusty vinyl spinning tails ain't no slowing up
Her rhythm syncopates sending waves through my soul
Each note, a job to making my story whole
Haunted midnight lounge, shadows crowned in blues
Her voice and echo, echo through my worn out shoes
Baselines walk tight, ropes cross the moonlit haze
Lost in smokey whispers on the mellow days
Trumpets echo, thoughts float tangled in our days
A slow dance, these streetlaps in a timeless maze
Notes colliding in spirals, rising in the air
Got me floating higher higher like I don't care
Emery glow, our dreams and neon dreams entwine
She lights my spark, simply divine
Our melodies, our magic weaves, enchanting nights and hazy years
