Moon, brew, slider like a moon
Flying through the sky, we gonna get there soon
I might not be born and bred on the west coast
But I feel it in my heart how the blood pump special
Spit it orchestral, combustible gusto
All across the globe, each town got a cutthroat so
They blowin' hot air like the Dust Bowl go
Travel through the air train or bus bone don't
et to take a snapshot photo or the cash box quota
So the wallet hard to fold up
Tourists get lured quick to attraction
When I'm out of town, I'm a victim of relaxing
East to west coast, even stopped off in Asheville
No tip on the table for a trash talking
Aphrodisiac, the world's an oyster
Next place you see me at, haven't made a choice yet
But keep the voice intact for the boys and girls in back
What is that noise? I say the noise is RAP
Music, movement for the people
Corner store anywhere, groovin' free flow
Jazz in a bistro, blues in Chicago
Mountain Rocky high, Boulder Colorado
Any town got a pop hoe
I'll pop in it, pop vintage tags at the thrift store
Let's go anywhere (anywhere)
Have a seat sitting bare
We'll figure out later how we're getting there
I'm dreaming large to see the stars
you have to
Born on the good side of a bad moon (what to do)
Putting faith in things I truly believe
Shooting west to the east, even to the West Indies
So within reach of the voice, skip the gap called speech
So let that boy talk, nah, let that boy teach
Got a couple of things to say
And I'll even hop on a chariot if it swing that way
Swing down, sweet cherry, stop and let me ride
Gravitate to the western states
The western way of living
Best to play position when in a foreign land
I'm local than a mofo, hawaiian shit
Local like the moko, pakalolo
And they think they call me homegrown
The cost to grow your own is so low
And it's solo
Best to know what I'm flowing about
It's going down
My aim to fly the map with feet on solid ground
East to west coast, travel the map
Across the globe and I'm coming right back
Flash in the pan, you gotta make it last
That's the plan, yeah that's the plan
East to west coast, travel the map
Across the globe and I'm coming right back
Flash in the pan, you gotta make it last
That's the plan, yeah that's the plan
Slide like a moon, flying through the sky
We gonna get there soon
Move through, slide like a moon, flying through the sky
We gonna get there soon
East to west coast, travel the map
Cross the globe and I'm coming right back
Flash in the pan, we gotta make it last
That's the plan, yeah that's the plan
East to west coast, travel the map
Cross the globe and I'm coming right back
Flash in the pan, we gotta make it last
That's the plan, yeah that's the plan
Move through, slide like a moon, flying through the sky, we gonna get there soon, move through, slide like a moon, flying through the sky, we gonna get there soon, move
Through, slider like the moon
Flying through the sky
We gonna get there soon
Through, slider like the moon
Flying through the sky
We gonna get there soon
Don't you just move on through
