Live in a time of straights and we got black sheep they don't fit in I'm like ha
Terrorists who want to cut limbs don't zoom into my true lens
These loose ends are too grim to discomprehend I'm like ha
Oh lord it's getting worse cops out in that gang turf
Rich folks don't share first God playing parents don't need birth
God prayers out and don't see church hands up and they shoot first
Another young life in that black curse I'm too hurt I'm like
You don't better come my way
Y'all better come my way, okay and say
Y'all better come my way, I'ma make a statement day by day
Y'all better come my way, y'all better come my way, okay and say

Peace sign, peace signs up, put'em on the air and go rise up (yeah)
Peace sign, peace signs up, put'em on the air and go rise up (yeah)
Live in a time of true greed, we got kids here can't write and read, I'm like ha
Disgust for that mistrust, say one word and you're handcuffed
Don't call bluff and you'll get struck and you ain't cool like ha
Live life with no limits, my way no gimmicks
Pro league, no scrimmage, crunch time and I finish
I'm that superstar, no blemish, I just own this
No tenant, you that background, no sentence, I'm the statement
Y'all better come my way, y'all better come my way, okay and say
Y'all better come my way, I'ma make a statement day by day
Y'all better come my way, y'all better come my way, okay and say
Y'all better come my way, I'm a make a statement day by day

Stand up, rise up, peace signs up, now what's up? (let's go)
Stand up, rise up, peace signs up, Now what's up? (let's go)
Livin' the time of loss, hope we got no ropes for that down slope
We got'em anywhere plenty that say nope
We got refugees on broke boats, I'm like ha
Real life and no TV, millionaires stay greedy
No loving is no grub, we got the homeless saying feel me
Y'all better come my way, y'all better come my way, okay and say
Y'all better come my way, I'ma make a statement day by day
Y'all better come my way, y'all better come my way, okay and say
Y'all better come my way, I'm a make a statement day by day
