Our dreams
All we can face
The open road will always wind away
We're learning to accept
Why we can't change
The story of our lives
We read between the lines
Oh, we cannot face
The open road will always wind away
We're learning to accept why we can't change
The story of our lives
We read between the lines
We read between the lines
Oh, we cannot face
The open road will always wind us away
We're learning to accept why we can't change
The story of our life
We read between the lines
We read between the lines
We're right between the lines
We're right between the lines
