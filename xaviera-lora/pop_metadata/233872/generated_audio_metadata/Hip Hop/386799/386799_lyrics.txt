Simply for the very fact, fools they don't know how to act
Rid it off, so better be checking yourself before you start getting checked
Cause what it be stepping upon to set you, I better be hitting the deck
It's like this, I don't know if a test can attack it
If I'm ever to go, I make way for seven more castles cuz
Please stop all things happening each and every day ya
In LA ya, the city of angels
Please stop all things happening each and every day ya
In LA ya, the city of angels
Please stop all things happening each and every day ya
In a layer, this city of angels
These type of things happen each and every day, yeah
In a layer
Simply for the fact that I'm on the edge
Nothing to lose, playing my dues
Not one to be making false moves, choose playing the rules
Temptations got me going out of my mind
Lord knows lost soul at the crossroads eternally yours
Hardcore, rough and rugged
Subject motherfuckers love it
But blind to the facts perhaps
See somebody think that I'm buggin' love and nothin'
No doubt thought about it I would ride for you
No second I start when it comes out to it I would die for you
Better reckon nobody rides so free between heaven and hell
So don't try to push me simply for the fact that I'm on the edge
For the way it is better watch your back
Better watch your stack
Simply for the very fact fools they don't know how to act
Read it all so better be checking yourself before yourself be getting checked
Cause what it be stepping up on the set y'all better be hitting the deck
It's like this I don't know what this can attest get
If I'm ever to go I'll make way for seven more castles gone
These type of things happen each and every day ya
In LA ya this city of angels
These type of things happen each and every day ya
In LA ya this city of angels
These type of things happen each and every day ya
In LA ya this city of angels
These type of things happen each and every day ya
In LA ya
It's like a circus, it's like a circus, it's like a circus
Better reckon up, better rise from sleep between heaven and hell
So don't try to push me simply for the fact that I'm on the edge
For the way it is, better watch your back, better watch your stack
Simply for the very fact, fools they don't know how to act
Better also better be checking yourself before yourself be getting checked
whether you step in the phone to set ya, better be hitting the deck
It's like, D-S-I-D-Y-O-U-R-A-T-I-S-C-A-N-N-A-T-AS-C-A
If I'm here for the girl, I'll make way for seven more castas, girl
These type of things happen each and every day, yeah
In LA, yeah
Listen to your angels
These type of things happen each and every day, yeah
In a layer, this city of angels
