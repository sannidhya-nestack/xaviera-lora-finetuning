See I done walked on fire, I walked on water, I walked on sand, and I walked on land, can you hear me now?

Hold me down, I said no man can hold my down
(Jah said)
(No one can hold me down)
Rub your face tough niggas if you been to struggle
Too many rats in this jungle so I keep on poison em
Since the day I was born I been a trouble to my mom
Word is born grandma told me I would see 21 I grab me a gun
Living life like a muscle man
Kill a couple men I ain't scared to shoot a faggot man
I'm a changed man niggas wanna keep on pushing it hey wait
Cause you fucking with a family man
I got a better plans big dreams to come true
All your troops is the truth
Ya niggas a cat who's very moose
Ya lose we got this game like an octopus
Niggas better move cause no time for them 22's
38 slugs when I'm puffing on the collie weed
Niggas bleed between they heart when they see the kid
Swaggin so deep everybody wanna be me
From rapping and singing damn I'm gonna make it
I walked on fire, I walked on water, I walked on sand, and I walked on land, can you hear me now?
Hey, can you feel me now?
You see, I don't walk on fire, I walk on water, I walked on sand, and I walked on land, can you hear me now?
Hey, can you feel me now?

I said no man can hold me down
Jah said, no one can hold me down
Can you hear me now? (Can you hear me now?)
Can you feel me now? (Can you feel me now?)
Ay yo I walk like a champion, talk like a champion
The swag is so sick and the hoodie say champion
It's B .I. to the J, you know your troops the game
Bustin' any motherfuckers that tryna bang
And y'all ain't tryna battle, get your paper up
Y'all niggas fallin' off while we steppin' up
While your album sales floppin', better pick those up
And if your hands ain't in the air, put those up
It's Big J, yo, I'm comin' straight for the top
Need ten zeros in the bank as soon as this drop
And album release, the whole world gon' cop
And I'm sorry to say this, but I'm gon' shop
I got my fitted on, my monkeys on, my wrist game mean
You should see the whip pose, oh man, it's obscene
Dollar signs in my eyes'cause all I see is green
And I'm feelin' like the king, so I'm lookin' for a queen
See, I don't walk on fire, I walk on water
I walk on sand and I walk on land, can you hear me now?
Hey, can you feel me now?
See, I don't walk on fire, I walk on water
I walk on sand and I walk on land, can you hear me now?
Hey, can you feel me now?
See, I don't walk on fire, I walk on water
I walk on sand and I walk on land, can you hear me now?
Hey, can you feel me now?
No man can hold me down, hold me down
I said, no man can hold me down
Jah said, no one can hold me down
Hold me down, I said no man can hold me down
Jah said, no one can hold me down
Hold me down, I said no man can hold me down
Jah said, no one can hold me down
