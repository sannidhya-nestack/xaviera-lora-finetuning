How long I don't make the same mistakes?
How long I don't make the same mistakes?
How long I don't make the same mistakes?
How long I don't make the same mistakes?
It was everything I dreaded
Seed-metted and deep-setted
I seed-headed for a brick wall
I picked all the piece shredded
Said it was a minor technicality
Detected, rejected, the pain surrounded me
Accused, put my dignity in question
Is it me or Justin?
I'm guessing frustration rushed in
I stayed in flux when my days were dusted
Never been afraid like gamma rays can bust in
My bravery I find it
Blind rage is gauge one page behind it
I'm staged in a full state of anatomic
Wars like quasars charge comets
I hit like worlds collided
Problems symptoms I dismiss'em
If it cause my system enlist'em
Push hard like pistons
Break the barrier
Hate to carry the caliber
Then I'll take things that I outpace myself
I'm tired of all this running, regrets they don't mean nothing
My life is tainted, but so glad it ain't there
Sometimes there ain't no help, but I keep pushing myself
But they don't make me
I'm self-sabotage standing
I struggle with tempered
My prosperity I fell and recanted
Why the hell am I standing
With myself in a frantic
Toxic cause my optic nerves are stranding
It pitch blackness impacted
Actions and passion
Vast with the gasses
I'm back with the brashness
The practical practice
Rashed with scholastics
Push till it hurts
Or push earth off its axis
But change ain't easy it's brutal
All that it takes is a break or a measy refusal of the confusion
Now I'm done losing power to contusion how I computed minor adjustments
I'm kinda constructed, finding some substance when my mind got abducted
Potential is reached, essentials are preached
Reaching all my then special and intentional feats
Tired of all this running
Regrets they don't mean nothing, my life is tainted, but so glad it made me
Sometimes there ain't no help, but I keep pushing myself
The world can hate me, but they don't make me
It's killing me, drilling me, feeling me
It'll be energy, I will be willingly
Instilling me every misery, bitterly
I'll reiterate it quickly
I won't go docile, I'll float and hostile
I'm supposed to bust out, my quotes are fossil
Fuse cruel world, do constant
Bruise, use my abused conscience
Conflicts, I survived it, timed it, prompted
With the mind of a genetic cybernetic hybrid
Tired of all this running
Regrets, they don't mean nothing, my life is tainted, but so glad it ain't there
And sometimes there ain't no help, but I keep pushing myself
But they don't make me
Tired of all this running
Regrets they don't mean nothing
My life is tainted
But so glad it ain't me
Sometimes there ain't no help
But I keep pushing myself
The world can hate me
But they don't make me
