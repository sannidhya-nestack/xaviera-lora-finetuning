Beans, brain shot, what?
Hey, yeah, uh-huh
Back, uh-huh, scratch, uh-huh
Uh-huh
This bitch
Skin slow
Blended on the way low
Our heart was next to his
Pressure got our wrists weak
Our hearts knew
Stout we are we are
Scent of his soul
Our Oprah overdosed
Partied till they died
This might just be his last high
His fate
Spend some
Overdose
Yeah, icy in the veins, feisty and deranged
Behind a cloud of smoke, the pricey down to pay
Another motel room in the bathtub
Eyes roll back off the ox in a rapture
Mary Jane ain't got nothing on Miss Emma
She had the Mona Lisa dissolving and disfigured
Another dimension, a needle breaking through the skin
Sloping back to reality, take the blanket off the window
Twistin' and turnin' under the covers for the next hit
Quenchin' the urges until his pusher got arrested
Court took his daughter away, you see it
Street corner, 2 AM, scout for the re-up, uh
No hotline number can save his soul
Thirty day programmer and may just overdose
Cold turkeys don't like to party'til they die
This might just be his last high
