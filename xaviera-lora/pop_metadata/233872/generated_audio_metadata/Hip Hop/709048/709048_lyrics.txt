Ladies and gentlemen the captain has turned the seatbelt sign on for you may now move around the cabin
However it's always a good idea whilst you're seated to keep your seatbelt loosely fastened
Take flight south for the winter we touch down right down in the middle we
Take flight west for the weather to the very last letter we be down for whatever we
Take flight got the green light cross ringers in the wind throw caution to the windpipe
We take flight catch you on the flip side dip dive do the rip tie ride ride
Ladies and gentlemen, if you've already done so, please ensure that all your carry-on baggage is placed directly underneath that seat in front of you, or in the overhead compartments for taxi take-off, landing, and any slight turbulence
Yeah, in more ways than one, we orbit the sun
Correlate, then circulate at a certain date
I've seen a cobra snake in the tall grass, tell'em fall back
Running game when the ball's flat, what you call whack
Hoop jumpin for the small stacks
Do what you gotta remember it's all tax
Call send a fax email run it back
Life like a game run it laps on the track
I'm feeling like I'm winded outside lookin in
Haven't done wind sprints in a good long minute man
Been down to spit since missy and the minute man
Now front the keys to the minivan and let it spin
Kick up dust let it settle like sediment
Shake off the rust zoom for the hell of it
Hella bent off the fifth like it's element
Wherever whenever with the weather vane
Taking flights to a better place
If there's anything myself or any of the crew can do for you throughout the flight, please don't hesitate to ask
Please sit back now, relax and enjoy your flight as you can
Take flight, south for the winter we
Touch down right down in the middle we
Take flight, west for the weather
To the very last letter we be down for whatever we
Take flight, got the green light
Cross ringers in the wind
Throw caution to the windpipe
We take flight, catch you on the flip side
Dip dive, do the rip tide, ride ride
In and out the city, business pleasure and back home
Turf where I surf, stay weighty and fat
Can get lazy, hazy vision, I'm trapped and shy
Do that, I'm strapped
With essentials, mental on instrumentals
Notebook, pens and pencils
Spray paint with the stencils
Thought heavy like my menstrual cycle
Red, red, black, no menstrual green
Save face, hella keen
Holla back, check my records pristine
Beat the style, I'm clean
But I don't have no royal treatment
Body scans, killer cams
Privacy scams
Hands pickin' through my afro
Asshole, low key lasso, F-O-H
They wear the mask, yo, seek relief, wanna take your place, yo
I need that window seat fast, bro
Get me outta here, they playin' games like Hasbro
I'm makin' moves about my cash, hoe
Also at this time, we do ask you refrain from using any cellular telephones
Or any remote control devices at any time during the flight
As these devices have been found interfering with various aircraft's electrical systems
Take flight, south for the winter we
Touch down, right down in the middle we
Take flight, west for the weather
To the very last letter we be down for whatever we
Take flight, got the green light
Cross ringers in the wind
Throw caution to the windpipe
We take flight, catch you on the flip side
Dip dive, do the rip tide, ride ride
