My city my God, my city my God, my city my God, my city my God, my city my God, my city my God, my city my God, my city my God, my city my God, my city my God
Runnin' through this maze
Mums the word becomes concerned if
Likes a bitch I put trust in her
She's not always right like customers
So I try to stay sharp before the rest occurs
And hug the curves when I ride the road
When I go for broke with one only goal
One trick pony got a trick up his sleeve (please)
Hand over fist and a fist in the breeze
So your time's up then it's time to go (nah)
If times get rough then it's time to be bold (oh)
Pick and choose which side of the road
We stick and move in survival mode
Bring a new meaning to Chicago code
No this ain't TV
No actors
No green screen
No cameras
Catching green lights in the city means go
Best to get busy we ready for more
On your marks
Get ready
Get set, go!
More, more, more, more, more
More, more, more, more, more
More, more, more, more, more, more, more
More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more
More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more
More, more, more, more, more, More, more, more, more, more
More, more, more, more, more ,more
On your marks, get ready, get going
Got something to show, start showing
Got something to be, start being
Got something to freestyle, friend
My city, my God, my sisters
My city, my God, my misters
My family, my blood, my cig
On my people all the lights are green
Yeah
All the lights are green
More to say and even less time to do it
A forest blaze, a metaphor for the movement
I bet it's more than what you might be ready for
A swisher, game winner, see confetti on the floor
See'em steady on the ball like Shabazz
Got my back against the wall, you could call that Shabazz
See the facts, so just watch me
You can pass me the ball, alley-oop that shit
The rafters are tall, the caption is more than just about rap
Let's write a new chapter in the paperback in my new book
Call it how to move rooks, earthquakes shook all the castles and crooks
Cracks in the corners in the city concrete with a very dope beat
Where we bury our teeth, we some very artiste
Hand of abyss, speaking of which you looking weak in the wrist
So we raise it up, weight down
Bruh raise up the stakes hold it up high
Raise up the gate
Shaw City stand tall (stand tall)
Shaw City stand tall (get it)
My city my God
We stand with our back straight up in this rat race
Money and time all underlined
Running through this maze run it run it down
Some at the summit some still running
Others just running
We do it for the love and hell yeah we love it we love it we love it we love it we love it
My city, my God, we stand with our back straight up in this rap race
Money and time all underlined
Runnin' through this maze, run it, run it down
Some men at the summit, some still run it
Others just run it, we do it for the love and hell yeah
We love it, we love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it
My city, my God, we stand with our back straight up in this rap race
Money and time all underlined
Runnin' through this maze, runnin', runnin' down
Some in at the summit, some still runnin'
Others just runnin', we doin' for the love and hell yeah, we love it, we love it, we love it
My city, my God, I'm stayin' with the rap straight up in this rap race
Money and time all underlined
Runnin' through this maze, runnin', runnin' down
Some in at the summit, some still runnin', others just runnin'
We doin' for the love and hell yeah, we love it, we love it, we love it
