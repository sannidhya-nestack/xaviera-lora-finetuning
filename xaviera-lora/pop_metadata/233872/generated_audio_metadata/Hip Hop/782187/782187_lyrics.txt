Emotionless this city light
Stand up, stand up
Cruel it is it clouds my eyes
All you gotta do is stand up, stand up
The dark, the dark shades on my day
I live inside this game
All you gotta do is stand up
They say a man can't live with bread alone
So I felt necessary to write this song
I wait for the time that they bring back Jesus
When our black sister will find true happiness and live strong
They say home is where the heart's at but it's hard to get there
When the feelings already left cause they say
I see a superscoping in his hailstorm
When disbelief is just getting warm
I see no reflections in the mirror
Without a rhyming word with innocence
So if you can redefine the time
Please bring back the love that we're missing
Cause all you gotta do is stand up
Stand up
I see only what I wanna see
All you gotta do is stand up
I'll be only who I wanna be
All you gotta do is stand up, stand up
And get in here
I don't care the capacity
Stand up, stand up
In time
I know my sister's got a ruck
When the pain is more than a nine month baby
So where is the shoulder to cry on
When it's not there
You feel like giving up
But you can't cut short
You can't redeem your mother's death
Knowing it's hopeless
Without education and guidance
I see your eyes widen
You know you can stand strong
We in trouble hard times
Has always been a part of our life
We've taken a stride
My understanding
Constitute political truth
If you don't know
I saw the war cry through the pain and the misery
And seeing God bled to blessin' it up
So you know you're not alone but you a winner
Stand up
Stand up
I see only what I wanna see
All you gotta do is stand up
I'll be only who I wanna be
All you gotta do is stand up
Stand up, stand up (I think it gives us space inside)
So if there's hope, please know it belongs to your destiny
Work hard, keep the cold light on beauty's skin
And not when it's laughing, cause it's not pretending
And when there's a lot to do with us not coming up
Get your mind right, stand up
So two sisters, believe in yourself
'Cause only you can help this hopeless world grow
without the black wing, you already know
All you gotta do is stand up
I don't see a future in line
Stand up, stand up
all you gotta do is stand up
All you gotta do is stand up
I'll be only who I want to be (stand up, stand up)
All you gotta do is stand up (get it in, get it in)
All you gotta do is stand up (I'll be just as I say)
Emotionless in city life (stand up, stand up)
Cruel it is, it clouds my eyes
The dark, the dark shades of my day
I live inside this place
