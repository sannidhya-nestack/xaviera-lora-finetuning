And walk up in the club
With a pocket full of money
Stop what you doing right there
And meet me at my table
Baby if you able
Girl you know we throwing money like we don't care
And mama said I'm crazy
This ain't how she raised me
Man I swear she got her brother feeling so wrong
So I'ma take this money
Throw it at this honey
Then I'ma get back right after this song man
Don't tell mama
I said don't tell mama
Yeah, I'm just doing what I gotta do
Yeah, she ain't rapping in the bathroom
But they saying I'm the number two
Yeah, she like saving for the kids
Ain't no such thing as being too rich
I'm like, I already know
And then for you know it, I'm already low
I'm sitting in this club, tryna break bread
But as you can see I'm running low on the dough
But I ain't gon' stop, see I'ma keep flexing
And she ain't even fly, so I'ma keep nexin'
And I'ma keep nexin'til I reach a whole'nother section
With nothing but a whole bunch of lesbians
See I'm talking real reckless
Hate to leave your girlfriend breathless
But tell her what up (And walk up in the club)
With a pocket full of money
Stop what you doing right there
And meet me at my table
Baby if you able
Girl you know we throwing money like we don't care
And mama said I'm crazy
This ain't how she raised me
Man I swear she got her brother feeling so wrong
So I'ma take this money
Lower that this hundred
Then I'ma get back right after this song
Man don't tell mama
And y'all think I'm joking (joking)
And y'all think I'm smoking
Y'all can't believe me (believe me)
And y'all can't receive me (receive me)
But y'all wanna be me
Y'all wanna leave me (leave me)
Yeah, talkin'bout them chickens (chickens)
And y'all think I'm sickin'
And y'all think I'm coldin' (coldin')
Boy, that's exactly what I'm doin' (doin')
That's every day and every morning (tell'em what)
Look, they tryna smoke me and choke me (choke me), yeah
But I'm running this game, boy (yeah), yeah
See, it ain't about the fame (nah), it ain't about the chain (nah), it ain't about them things, boy (yeah), yeah
They said it's all about Mama Dukes, yeah
Just doing what she had to do, yeah
So I'ma get her something nice (nice), I might mess around and get her something twice, what up?
With a pocket full of money
Stop what you doing right there
Aye meet me at my table
Baby if you able
Girl you know we throwing money like we don't care
Aye mama said I'm crazy
This ain't how she raised me
Man I swear she got her brother feeling so wrong
So I'ma take this money
Throw it at this honey
Then I'ma get back right after this song man
Don't tell mama
Don't tell mama
