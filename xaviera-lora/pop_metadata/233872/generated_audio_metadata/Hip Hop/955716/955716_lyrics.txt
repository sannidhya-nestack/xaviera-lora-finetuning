In the beginning there was nothing
But the darkness fell gave birth to something moving
It was all consuming time was born and dust was blooming
Gases were forming circles lights colliding blues and purples
Darkness fell in love with the light gotta never let go
Gotta hold on tight it was warming was skin conforming
Imagination of minds were swarming dancing
With hands in the air voices singing loud and clear
Rhythm found ebb and flow breathing deep like the wind you'll blow
Lines were drawn oceans parted thoughts of a soul filled the heart
Curiosity, individual, supernatural, all subliminal
Man-made monsters, man-made God
At odds with the light and the darkness bonds
Demons, angels, pastors, criminals
Liars, seekers, warriors, villagers
Look to something, see the eagle
With knowledge there's power, good and evil
The more we know, the more upheaval
Deceitful, feeble, hungry people
Covered in darkness our bodies et
Awaken the mind, seek no regret
Evolving fire forms the blade
To sharpen the mind and the light be saved
Growing old like seed to grave
The light and the dark form one remade
In the beginning it was
The sun gave warmth from the cold, a miracle
Praise to the sun, bringer of light
Save us from the darkened night
Religion formed, ideas changed
Sinners born, ivers praised
The land was slaughtered just to raise
Know the truth and you'll be saved
Those opposing mind a question
Cast aside with stone rejection
Cut it out if not perfection
Man's ideas just perspected
Different culture, different method
Precious metals, paper vested
Anarchy
Revolution brewing wars on restitution controlling
Man found power, man make fire, man build tower children
Born confused and sure which path in life to choose
Once ideas manifested into reality hearts invested
Change of thinking broke the mold
Different people bought and sold murderous
Uncompromising tagging people numbers binding leaders
The kings, the queens, politicians, dirty schemes, possession
What's rightfully mine, rules and laws and order, crime, question
Have you been deceived? Truth inside is truth perceived knowing
And one decides only from himself he hides with other voices in his mind
Selling purpose to his life, what is peaceful, what is good
What is thought misunderstood? Seek your power, defy the odds
Stand tall in the sunlight, land of gods you're breathing
It's what you feel across your skin, insight reveal ocean
Of pure emotion, paint the sound of art in motion
Honesty, when you take the road you built yourself
With the bricks you mold eternity
Forever laid as a child in the light that the darkness made
