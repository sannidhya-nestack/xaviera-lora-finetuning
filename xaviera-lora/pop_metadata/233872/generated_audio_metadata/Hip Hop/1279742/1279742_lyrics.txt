Yeah, yeah, yeah
There ain't no love in my heart
There never was from the start
That's why I stay with two bitches
Like I got away in the night
Scared unless somebody new
And I keep'em all in the dark
All in the dark
You think I'm lonely
I think I'm playin' it smart
I think I'm playin' it smart
Yeah, level headed with a new beginning I was coming apart
Yeah, giving to you it was everything even down to my heart
Yeah, broken pieces have a reason it's a reason
I couldn't feel it beating for your love and I wonder if you were a season
A lesson, a blessing in disguise
Wisdom advising with advice
Pay attention to recurring signs
Emotions are what have my vision blind
Would've stayed any longer be my demise
Would you be there for my funeral?
I was feeling the void, usable
All I ever was to you
That's all I ever meant to you, huh?
Removable
It's a shame
It's a damn shame
The same one sayin' I just need somebody real
It's a damn shame
The same one wantin' love
But don't know how to take it
Always fakin'
Facades of your toxic relation
I cry out for help
Translation
I think I'm playin' it smart
Yeah
Level headed with a new beginning
I was comin' apart
Yeah
Given to ya it was everything
Even down in my heart
Yeah, broken pieces have a reason, it's a reason
I couldn't feel the beating for your love
And I know for a fact you were seasoned, just know there ain't
There ain't no love in my heart
There never was from the start
That's why I stay with two bitches like I got away in the night
Scared unless somebody new and I keep'em all in the dark
You think I'm lonely, I think I'm playin' it smart
There ain't no love in my heart, there never was from the start
That's why I stay with two bitches like I got away in the night
Scared of letting somebody new in, I keep'em all in the dark
You think I'm lonely, I think I'm playin' it smart
It was all love at beginning
I fell for everything you had in an instant
Like I got me a trophy I'm winning
I fell for you deep because we both was digging
Yeah emotions took over I'm tripping
I'm usually moving off how I be thinking
Yeah but then I get caught up in feelings
It could set you free or put you in a prison
I let you win I let down my guard
Would give you my last I gave you my heart
Thought we was friends you had left me scarred
You took everything I had tore it apart
How could you do that
You made me weak and you knew that
Now I be here by my lonely
You ain't need to have to go that far
With your boy at the end of the day
Man we could've been homies
But I'm a muse
Man I guess you was amused
Told me bout your past and I thought you would change
Now I been mixing up potion and potent
I'll do anything that be numbing the pain
So I been spinning like I hit an artery
Prayin' to God I ain't love you in vain
Just know I treated you just like a queen
No nigga bout to come through how I came
I'm playing it smart
Yeah
Level headed with a new beginning
I was coming up hard
Yeah, given to ya, it was everything
Even down on my heart, down on my soul
Broke it to pieces, how I make it whole
This is a letter to somebody new
If you come around, I think you should know
There ain't no love in my heart
There never was from the start
That's why I stay with two bitches
Like I got away in the night
Scared of letting somebody new in
I keep'em all in the dark
You think I'm lonely
I think I'm playing it smart
