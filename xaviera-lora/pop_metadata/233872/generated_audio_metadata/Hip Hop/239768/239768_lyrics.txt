Come on, get a piece of this ghetto street beef
I'm the reason number one why niggas carry the heat
With hands like these, they make you wanna grab me
Find your ass on your knees, searchin' for air, tryna breathe
If you grab me, come up missin' like child support
You lost your nigga support, landed on life support
Everybody, somebody think they want me
You think you do but you don't, you
Don't want me
You can speak if you want
But I don't talk to you
So if you speak to me
Then I ain't speaking to you
Fake
I'm a trill nigga
Fuck a dollar bill
You in the presence of a real nigga
I done make a mill nigga
You in the presence of a real nigga, I done make a mill nigga
We can take it to the streets, let's take it to the streets
We can take it to the streets, let's take it to the streets
We can take it to the streets, let's take it to the streets
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
We can take it to the streets, let's take it to the streets
We can take it to the streets, let's take it to the streets
We can take it
Let's take it to the streets, let's take it to the streets, come on, motherfuckers, come on, let's get it on
Examine the words in this song, enticed by dollar bills and women wearing thongs
So long to these suckas, while I'm passing you by
Just because you're gonna lose it doesn't mean don't try
Battle cats like battle cats, these cats want battle back
So hold me down black, this ghetto streets sound black
E stay focused if you feel me cuz
Get lost in the beat, maintain the buzz
They be barking a lot but they don't want me dog
Fear become reality when the cage is gone
Ain't nothing holding you back, we can take it to the streets
Let's take it to the streets, we can take it to the streets
Let's take it to the streets, we can take it to the streets
Come on, motherfuckers come on
Come get me, you don't want me, you don't want me, you don’t want me, you don't want me, you can take it to the streets, let's take it to the streets, we can take it to the streets, let's take it to the streets, we can take it to the streets, let's take it to the streets, come on, mother fuckers, come on, we can take it to the streets, let’s take it to the streets, we can take it
We can take it to the streets, let's take it to the streets
We can take it to the streets, let's take it to the streets
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
These niggas be bitchin', switchin' from real to fake niggas
Bitch made, threw out my hands, he pulled a switchblade, two blades
I pull the smooth out my shoes, lay these niggas kill me
I'm sure that you feel me
My introduction
Witness this nigga you're facing my verbal confrontation
Educate these bitches bout hating no time for litigation
I won't engage in conversation so fuck debating
Down here you gets naked no conversation
It's scary how I buried my adversaries
Burn them all up like my name was Kerry
In a hurry I mash out evading lube
I love it down south you should come down here
Have a coconut smile, or some chicken and beer, haha, come get me
We can take it to the streets, let's take it to the streets
We can take it to the streets, let's take it to the streets
We can take it to the streets, let's take it to the streets
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
We can take it to the streets, let's take it to the streets
We can take it to the streets, let's takes it to the streets
We can take it to the streets, let's taking it to the streets
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Dig it up, Mr. (Dig it up, Mr.)
Dig it up, Mr. (Dig it up, Mr.)
Dig it up, Mr. (Dig it)
