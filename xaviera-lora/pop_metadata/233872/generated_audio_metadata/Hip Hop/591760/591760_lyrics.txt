Blade runners play the block like concrete
Dreaming about a beamer with their heaters in arms
Reach women in Palm Beach where Miami heat floss
Seats to floss like a don, two arms crossed on Wall Street
But cautiously they return to the cold
Cold weather when it's 30 below
Burners approach, never know if it be murder she wrote
You gotta study the text, the context and refer it to blow, you know
Then it's other factors that make you double backwards
Cops checking your duffel bags with funny badges
Interrupting the magic all of a sudden it's tragic
And you were trying to kick it just like a punt in practice
Imagine the confusion it starts fusing
Fueling up in the fire to finally start a movement
To crush the competition like prohibition
Wars of attrition that be your decision
You know the mission
When I come down, come down to block
You better close up shop, I don't care if you're ready or not
Got a team by me, now the runny is spot for me
When I come down, come down the block, ay
You better close up shop, see them young boys running they mouth
Till I had them same boys out running around for me
Yeah, tell us to feed the hungry but homie we need that money
How I'm gon' meet these bunnies with sneakers that's lean and funny
For real, if I ain't icing the cake
The pie won't bake and I don't got time to waste
Too many nights, they deprived me of steak, I wanted rib eyes
Grew up in the pig style with sick ties to semis
Where friends died walking to school
The other side want static like they bought you some wool
They pour salt on your wounds, pick and choose your direction
You either pack a medic or you manically depressive
Under pressure to leave long sleeves where they cover your heart
Running the race, no cleats, so you struggle to start
You stutter, mumble to talk, learn to articulate
Authenticate your style, embrace where you taking it now
I know you sick of cash shaking you down
It builds character, soon enough you feeling superior
When I come down, come down the block
You better close up shop, I don't care if you're ready or not
Got a team by me and at a runny spot for me
When I come down, come down the block, ay
You better close up shop, see them young boys running they mouth
Till I had them same boys out running around for me
I vomit realness, saving up the copper building for my familiar
Millions will probably stop the stealing, killing is dead, get it?
Figure the figures configured to get the bread
Living it up while the feds listen, morning my head risen
Brushing my teeth, contemplating cooking the beef just for something to eat
You street and you relate to that
Manifestation rap
The infiltration from the station got us pacing back
I stay intact like a poster
Posted in the crib hopeful
Watching 50 Cent talk to Oprah to describe the culture
My homie Sean tatted both his arms
You think he thuggin but he puttin most his dough in bonds
My local charm did the most for me
Openly prophetic told him I would do it though my tongue was jokingly
Move like a tectonic plate
Replace coca leaves no retreat
Rolling deep different kind of potency
When I come down come down the block
You better close up shop
I don't care if you're ready or not
Got a team by me that'll run in your spot for me
When I come down, come down the block
You better close up shop
See them young boys runnin' they mouth
I had them same boys out runnin' around for me
When I come down
Come down the block, ay, you better close up shop
I don't care if you're ready or not
Got a team by me that'll run in your spot for me
When I come down, come down the block, ay, you better close up shop
See them young boys running they mouth
I had them same boys out running around for me, ay
