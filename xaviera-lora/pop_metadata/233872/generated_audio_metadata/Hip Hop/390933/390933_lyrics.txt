Yup, yup, yup, yup, holla at your boy
Yup, yup, yup, uh, yup, yup, holla at your boy
Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yeah, holla at your boy
Yup, yup, yup, yup, uh, yeah
A black scully, as I hit the city
In the black beers counting ends, holding my 9 milli
Peeping out the suburban, that's whirring on the road
Two ounces in my front pocket sporting Jordans of old
Falsely accused of selling weight, marriage a boner
No dimes, just weight, leave you all in a coma
Connect folk, foes, as I reach for heat
Leaving twitching eyes rolling, face down in the street
The city that I'm from
Keeps me on the run, a rootin', tootin', glock shootin'
Son of a gun, stay hyped, ready to snap
At the drop of a hat, push this headline back
Left his BM in a sack
Whenever you need me, holla at me
No matter the time, just hit me
Not a fake, I'm the real McCoy
Pick up the phone and holla at your boy
Whenever you need me, holla at me
No matter the times I'm just here to see
Not a fake I'm the real McCoy
Pick up the phone and holler at your boy
Reach down for my life
Check twice I pick it up
No luck he's struck
Chewing his tongue in his truck
So what he's gone
Give his family my sympathy
Better him than me
Rest in peace, all my life I've been a victim
Things I can't control, so I keep stacking loot
Lock and load then shoot, beat me out on no game
Brought up on pain, family members in my head
On the heaven train, well other than that
You need me, holler back, I'm your boy in the hood
I got you wishing they would cross you or your mama
It's gon' be some drama, all them laying down silent
Or stuck in a coma at the club, man
You showed me your tech, anybody disrespect
Cop killers they catch
And if they step on my Jordans
You know the ones I just cop
Y'all can catch him on the news
Staking up the block
Whenever you need me, holla at me
No matter the time, just hit me
Not afraid, I'm the real McCoy
Pick up the phone and holla at your boy
Whenever you need me, holla at me
(Holla at your boy)
The man that's hot as a sweet cheese (Holla at your boy)
Not a fake, I'm the real McCoy (Holla at your boy)
Pick up the phone and holla at your boy (Holla at your boy)
Casing in the crack house, slinging them things
What you need, a half a key or a eight feet?
Glocks in his hands, ounces in his drawers
Robbing in the rain, bussing in the fog
In the bars, no tab, need a ride
Free calves, selling eighties and halves
Moving bricks and slabs, facial slugs for mean mugs
Drowning in the tub, putting chest plate up
For catching them slugs can be a killer if need be
Bling you can't see me, sporting purple in my clothes
Like grimace or Bonnie, don't try me you're fooled
200 degrees you're cold, too much you're old
Before a rocket is sold, whatever you need I got it
I'm the real McCoy
Put your scratch where your mouth is, holler at your boy
Like a sponge everything they spill I soak it up
So I just supposed to let him leave me slump in my truck
Whenever you need me, holler at me
No matter the time, just hear and see
Not a fake, I'm the real McCoy
Pick up the phone and holler at your boy
Whenever you need me, holler at me
No matter the time, just hear and see
Not a fake, I'm the real McCoy
The dark moon and holla at your boy
