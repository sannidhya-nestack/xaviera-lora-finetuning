Shy snow, baby won't you take me to the goal
Where the hawks they scream, the icy winds they blow
Shy snow, baby won't you take me to the goal
Where the hawks they scream, the icy winds they blow
Under pressure, do you feel pressure?
You act the wrong, you make a wrong, you end up in a stretcher
Under pressure, the weight of the pressure
Come down and then it fall upon you
Under pressure, the youth feel pressure
They reaching for the gun to find another buried treasure
Under pressure, the youth feel pressure
They wanna know whether it's all true
Can you feel the coldness when you're up in the sky
Everybody cold but many many want money
When you will save the one will you go to survive
Run around with cars so nothing ever harm me
I don't know how long that I'm gonna be around
Don't know how many days that I have above ground
It's inevitable that I will get locked down
So I do what I gotta do
Highs and lows like Eisenberg, happen low when the time occurs
Find the courage inside of ya, the dollar come but the dollar's short
Go to the court don't fall for sport, he's feeling Jillinger
Pinpoint to the millimeter feel the heater radiated
If pressure bust pipes consider this a flood
When the filament go pop, you'll be feeling this in your gut
Freeze over like the lake, so the little kids can skate
Sold your soul at any rate, so it goes so it fades
Shy snow, baby won't you take me to the globe
Where the hawks they're screaming, the icy winds they blow
Shy snow, baby won't you take me to the globe
Where the hawks they're screaming, the icy winds they blow
His finger is on the trigger
Hey brother man come on and put the gun down
Hey brother man come on and put it down
They were the ones who gave us the guns and they are aimed at you
Hey brother man come on and put the gun down
Hey brother man come on and put it down
They were the ones who gave us the guns and they are aimed at you
Pressure builds like a stack of bills
A cold wind killed all the daffodils
A man made a deal he's packing steel
Don't really feel right he's got the chills
All the way down to the back of the heels
The only way out he's about to peel out
Chi-Town nights are freaks come out
He tried to sneak around without a critical beat down
He could be found a week from now where the fishes sleep out
Talk on the street he's in too deep
With the wrong damn people you read about
Brand new jeep for his love sweepy
He could feed him like kings
Queen of house and live life clean
Sure he wouldn't need to wear the same thing three times in a week now
Back to trade always getting paid on minimum wage
Dealing great packs of cane checked his ice
Patrick Kane stood at the elevator door and waved
Time to drop bounce get faded right as the door became adjacent
Heard that anticipated the deal was real but something ate him
A man stepped out his hands were shaking raised his iron fist with a hollow tip
Look at how he gripped the hatred
So quiet you could hear the swept drip down on pavement
In the way he moved the end was imminent and already painted
You're scared
It's either him or you
But there's this killer standing in front of you
Reaching, there's no time to think
His finger is on the trigger
It'd be nice for a day
If all the youth they got to play
All together despite the weather
And everybody's cool
It'd be nice for a date
If all the youth they got to play
All together despite the weather
And everybody's cool
Shy snow
Baby won't you take me to the globe
Where the hawks they scream
The icy winds they blow, shy snow
Baby won't you take me to the goal
Where the hawks they're screaming
Where the icy winds they blow, shy snow
Baby won't you take me to the goal
Where the hawks they're screaming
The icy winds they blow, shy snow
Baby won't you take me to the goal
Where the hawks they scream
The icy winds they blow, oh, oh, oh
Under pressure, the youth feel pressure
They reach out for the call to find another way return home
Under pressure, the youth feel pressure
They wanna know where their eyes are true
Under pressure, the youth feel pressure
You're at the ready, we are on the end of the night stretch out
Under pressure, the youth feel pressure
Hold down and then let's walk on through
Under pressure, the youth feel pressure
They reaching for the gun to find another buried treasure
Under pressure, the youth feel pressure
They wanna know when lies are true
