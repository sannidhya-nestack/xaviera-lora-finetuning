Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
And though we're traveling on this road alone
We out here figuring out how to make it on our own
Now we've come too far to just stop now
Family's gotta eat, we gotta make it somehow
So don't give in when the struggle is on
When you hit them hard times just be strong
Cause we come too far to just stop now
We gotta make it so let them blessings rain down
I'm tryna make it happen in these streets I'm hustling hard
I'm tryna get it cracking breaking cheese with all of y'all
I'm tryna make this money stack for my kids
So they don't have to go through the same things that I did
I'm trying to fill out applications
Everyday I be facing different situations
My peoples procrastinating
I'm trying to keep my sneakers tight
While running from cops
They hit the block just for a bag
You would swear they would swap
Oh
I'm trying to make sure these open they eyes
Because the devil's in disguise
Also known as blue and white
I'm trying not to hit the bottle as hard as I do
And still I'm trying to give it my best at everything that I do
Now, I'm tryna make you feel the root of the pain
So if you put the youth in the game
If you reach, I'ma preach
Never go against the grain
It's Mack'til it ain't a damn thing changed
And I never let nobody treat me like no lame
How much more do I want to
I'ma live how I want to
Get grimy if I want to
Or I'll face the consequences
I'ma do what I want to
I'ma live how I want to
Get grimy if I want to
For the last ten years I've been writing, rapping, performing, producing, fighting, hustling all my marbles I'm losing for the last ten years
I've been striving in this system a victim of prosecution evading my constitution for the last ten years
A lot of my niggas deceased they started gangs started wars and supplied us all with the heat for the last ten years
You've been hearing tales about the market of beats so many people infected man made disease
For the last 10 years
I been tryna get up out this ghetto
I'm hustling, I'm serving, I'm working
I'm tryna stay mellow
For the last 10 years
I done got closer to Jesus
Cause when I find myself slipping the F's
We pick up the pieces
For the last 10 years
I been tryna keep myself sane
Been tryna find someone to blame
Cause it's my life, it's in it's lane
For the last 10 years
I been tryna go against the grain
I look at a grown man
No legal ways to make no change
I'ma do what I want to
I'ma live how I want to
Get grimy if I want to
Or have physical consequences
I'ma do what I want to
I'ma live how I want to
Get grimy if I want to
Or have physical consequences
We been writing a lot, and all the writing we got
We should be writing the spot, writing the drop
We ain't trying to say they wrong but we writing they not
Play me to the left, it'll stop writing they not
I'm writing it hot, ghetto cops go writing in socks
Put up cameras take our rights and we lock
I won't be left at the bottom as we write on top
Give us a deal that'll make us sound right on the dot
They ain't know a nigga like me live writing the block
Y'all only saying right, uh, cause we write like Pac
Record stores to have your mans write in stock
You got the right hits it'll be right in your box
I'm a hungry nigga I ain't write for props
Some say middle phony want the writing to stop
Cause parts have writing around the whole clock
Either writing your will or writing is hip hop
I'ma do what I want to
I'ma live how I want to
Get Grammy if I want to
Or have physical consequences
I'ma do what I want to
I'ma live how I want to
Get grimy if I want to
Or have physical consequences
No trouble alone this road alone
We out here figuring out how to make it on our own
Now we've come too far to just stop now
Families gotta eat we gotta make it somehow
So don't give in when the struggle is on
When you hit them hard times just be strong
Cause we come too far to just stop now
We gotta make it so let them blessings rain down
