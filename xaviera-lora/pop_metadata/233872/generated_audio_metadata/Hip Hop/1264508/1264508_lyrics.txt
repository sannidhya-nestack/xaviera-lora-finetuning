I'm taking to downtown where the vibe is right
I'm staking my claim on a lost old sight
That never could see the light of day in the dark dark dark shadows I pray
Walking the streets under stormy sky
Where I'm searching for dreams that never die
And that echoes the night so bright
Oh in the heart of the city my story's told
Downtown shadows come and play
In this world I choose to stay
Lost in the rhythm of endless night
Praying for dawn but loving the sight
Restless of secrets and alleyways
Every new stranger a friend who stays
Graffiti dreams on every wall in the shadows
And the shadows I stand tall
Breeze blows the dots away
In the downtown lights I find my way
Hustle and bustle, a constant heart
This city speaks and I support
The downtown shadows come and play
In this world I choose to step
I'm lost in the music of endless night
Prayin' for dawn, lovin' the fight
I'm taking it downtown where the vibe is right
I'm staking my claim on a lost old sight
That never could see the light of day in the dark dark dark shadows I pray
Walking the streets under stormy sky
Where I'm searching for dreams that never die
And the echoes of night so bright
Oh in the heart of the city my story's told
Downtown shadows come and play
In this world I choose to stay
Lost in the rhythm of endless night
Praying for dawn but loving the sight
Whispers of secrets in alleyways
Every new stranger a friend who states graffiti dreams
On every wall in the shadows
In the shadows I stand tall
Breeze blows the doubts away
In the downtown lights I find my way
Hustle and bustle a constant hug
This city speaks and I succumb
Downtown shadows come and play
In this world I choose to stay
I'm lost in the music of endless night
Prayin' for dawn, lovin' the fight
