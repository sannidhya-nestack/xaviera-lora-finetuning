So I like to get rowdy but show
No I'm not the fight but the crowd reacts to them (over the top)
So cool off, chill out, it's not a bug out and
Yes a Dominican can also get down
With the new style for me is wicked wild
Those who try to diss they got rubbed out
My cousin create the funky fat track sound
But they just scratch it when I let the other hoes around
So when I swat if you can drink boy try
I'll choose a Philly tea and drink up cold 45 yes I am
The woman jumpin' then I dunkin'
I'm boogie-woogie I give a stack of scooby-dooby (what?)
Get off the knife and stop jocking me
Yes I'm getting rich my hoes are making money
So there you go, is it'cause the coots sting? Don't step in the ring'cause you might get flinged
Come on, get with it, what's the matter? Don't you know the meaning of the word boom-batter?
You got the right to fight (fight, fight)
You got the right to boom-batter
You got the right to fight (fight, fight, fight)
You got the right to boom-batter
You got the right to fight (fight, fight), you got the right
You got the right to fight, you got the right to ask, ask
Step in the 94, I mean war, jab a jaw, whichever wrist get raw
Got a boom batter'bout to put up hands
Got a boom batter'bout like clubberland
strong as jazz is beat to the Latin
Stronger than a bottle of gothic acid
Stronger than a DT full of proof docket
Stronger than a puff of a thousand crackhead (boosh that's strong)
Stronger than the word, pay your mind to this and fuck what you heard
Boom batter makes you put out like T .O., some kid did jump
But we like to fight
Murder, that a step to the set up
Suck a joke, the punks put up a shut up
Get head, said it all for some adder
We talking mad shit like you on a blue batter
I don't know why these kids have to be so damn tough
Back in my days we used to settle it the easy way
But now all they want to do is boom bata boom
Fight, fight, fight, fight
So what is the meaning of the word poom badda
Doesn't mean it's scattered when it matters the most
Or when your ass is about to get lit like toast
Bread or get your big fat head full of lead
Over self don't bullshit your head said
Oh and the niggie knock up the other mans blocker
Off his shoulder
I box and rocks kids younger and older
Huh like I told ya
You got the right to fight (uh)
You got the right to (do matter)
You got the right to fight (uh)
You got the right to (do matter)
You got the right to fight (uh)
You got the right to (do matter)
You got the right to fight (uh)
You got the right to (do matter)
(crowd cheering)
(I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it)
