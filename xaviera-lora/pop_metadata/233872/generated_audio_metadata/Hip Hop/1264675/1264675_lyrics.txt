Queen of my world, I wear my crown proud
No one ever gonna change that, shout it out loud
Walking on my path with strength and grace, nothing gonna stop me
I own this space, I'm the queen of my world
No one can change this girl
Facing the storms, I stand tall
I'm burned through it ever, as much as I turn I hold my ground
I'm the queen of my world, no one can change this girl
No matter what they say, I rise everyday
Keep on shining, lighting up the night
Queen of my world, I'll wear my crown proud
No one ever gonna change that, shout it out loud
Walking on my path of strength and grace, nothing gonna stop me
I own this space, I'm the queen of my world
No one can change this girl
Facing the storms, I stand tall
Burn through whatever
Twist and turn, I hold my ground
I'm the queen of my world
No one can change this girl
No matter what they say, I rise everyday
Keep on shining, lighting up the night
