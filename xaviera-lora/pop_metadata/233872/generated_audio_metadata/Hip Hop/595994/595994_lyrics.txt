Uh
On the grill
Ah
Yeah
All of sudden it feels different
Finally tuned automobile that can't pass emissions
Track record shatters the competition but the heart is missing
Artist climbing the charts wishing it would fall apart
That was never part of the mission
Tortilla eat up the rap they just tell him speed up the track
They gone give him keys to Maybach but he just don't feed into that
But he cannot leave the decathlon
They want him rapping on every track that they feed him
So they can eat off the catalog
Moms crying got her raining tears like casting dogs after all
She done witnessed all her suspicions decisions come to fruition
Her son is just a musician she's wishing he never rapped at all
But that's the fall when you rise
Hypnotized blessing in disguise
See the skies open up when he prays closing his eyes
Trying to focus the mind to an elevated state
Like he was lord of the flies in the court of spartan
On the rail all these rappers looking for a deal
On the prowl working on they style showing they skill
I reveal not everybody's trying
If you really wanna make it, learn to cook your own meal on the rail
All these rappers looking for a deal on the prowl
Working on they style, showing they skill, I reveal
Not everybody's trying to build
If you got your own bricks, time to take it to the field
Yeah, it's time to set it, verbal callousness
Aesthetics gotta let it hang out like ghetto burgers
They givin em flat word to Roberta
Learn to carry your burner no murders
But if his beef is a waiter ready to serve him his word is his ball
Finish the song with the message he wrote to his son
If he's to die learn the lesson don't ever respond
To all the urges in your habitat
The only one that kept you sleepin on a wetter mattress
That matter fact
Sick of the game cause it made him soup
Gator suits Mercedes coupes dipped in the latest boots
Sipping that 80 proof feeling like a baby Zeus
Till they put his head in the noose beg him to take it loose
Never people could change quick as the weather
Sever all the ties when they peeping your endeavors
Clever forever witty die young in the city but his wife's pretty
Everybody recite with me on the rail
All these rappers looking for a deal on the prowl
Working on they style showing they skill I reveal
Not everybody's trying to build if you really wanna make it
Learn to cook your own meal on the rail
All these rappers looking for a deal on the prowls
Working on they style showing they skill I reveal
Not everybody's trying to build if you got your own bricks
Time to take it to the field
Via satellite, sacrifice trade for his paradise
God got him on the road like a paradise
Son grew up, can't talk to him so he's doing the same now
Even his song blew up, see his arms drewed up
Chains on his neck in the game for respect
Growing pains to collect, didn't listen
Trying to get his homies in position
Situation sticky like he spilled soda
And the kitchen didn't go with intuition
And his mama know the outcome
Seen it through his father
He was obviously outgunned and now done
But kids gotta see it for they self
Giving you the middle finger for the hands
They were dealt reckless and effective
Block move like Tetris aggressive
Hollin' at the moon for a crescent, stressin'
Make a dollar, now he gotta stretch it
Get excited when they see him like a fetish
On the rail, all these rappers lookin' for a deal
On the prowl, workin' on they style, showin' they skill
I reveal, not everybody's tryin' to build
If you really wanna make it, learn to cook your own meal
On the rail, all these rappers lookin' for deal
On the prowl, workin' on they style, showin' they skill
I reveal, not everybody's tryin' to build
If you got your own bricks, time to take it to the field
On the rail
All these rappers looking for a deal on the prowl
Working on they style showing they skill I reveal
Not everybody's trying to build if you really wanna make it
Learn to cook your own meal on the rail
All these rappers looking for a deal on the prow
Working on they style showing they skill I reveal
Not everybody's trying to build if you got your own bricks
Time to take it to the field on the rail
