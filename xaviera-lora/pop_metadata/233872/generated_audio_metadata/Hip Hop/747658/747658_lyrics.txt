Let me start it with a table for two
I was digging the view we elevated
Draped in that LA hard denim
Had to tilt my shades off look down she winning
Killing the game when she walked in
Double C's on the bag and them lenses in
Thinking this can't be life but if it is then we ride tonight
Got me feeling right on time
Gym beam in my hand but it's you on my mind
Wanna make a toast tonight
Baddest chick I ever seen in my life
I'm gonna take it slow
Gonna give you what you need
I'll be your fantasy
Say that you'll stay, stay, ay, ay
Never thought that it would be like this
Slow dance, give my lady a kiss
Old school love
I'm a sucker for the temptations
Heating on up, baby no waiting
So when I put it down she go pick it up
Instagram throw them pictures up (hot)
Sunday morning and I'm next to my queen
Throw that L green right on the vinyl (set the scene)
Hit the town for the week or two
Fly home, ask mom what she think of you (yeah)
Make a brother wanna fall for the smile
Like a skydiver falling a mile
I'm gonna take it slow (slow)
Gonna give you what you need (what you need)
I'll be your fantasy
Say that you'll stay, stay, ayy, ayy
You and I, side by side
We gonna make it, baby
You and I, side by side
We gonna make it, baby
Been a long week but we still so with it
Club turned out it's the reason we in it
We gotta keep it young both nothing to lose
Single owner status we could update soon
Drinks up toast what black label for two
I ain't even ask she was ready to move
Gave me that look so I know there's no doubt
Last call down grab the keys roll out
I'm gonna take it slow
Gonna give you what you need
I'll be your fantasy
Say that you'll stay, stay, ay, ay
