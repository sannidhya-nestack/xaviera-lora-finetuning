You might catch me down south
Trapped in a club
I'm north in a Benz
Ridin' on clubs
Out west with my Feds
Protectin' my chest
On the east coast with my crew
You know what we do
Get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow, get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow, get low, get low
To the flow, to the flow, get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow
Off in Africa, seated with the kings up in Canada
Doing time where it changed, in Detroit with Aretha
Blowing out some speakers, in Montana with Santana
On tour in some bleachers, I make you feel like you all good
No stress on your brain, I even sympathize with you
When your heart's in pain, bang your head up and down
This your thing, gon' do it, I'll be right here when you come back
So get used to it
Ay-ya-hay, gettin' low, gettin' low
Ay-ya-hay, to the flow, to the flow
Ay-ya-hay, gettin' low, gettin' low
Ay-ya-hay, to the flow, to the flow
Ay-ya-hay, gettin' low, gettin' low
Ay-ya-hay, to the flow, to the flow
Ay-ya-hay
Get low, get low (why are you) to the flow, to the flow
I might be in Switzerland, coming through headphones
At the opera in the hood, sitting on chrome
At your high school in a bedroom, that's where you might meet me
Even babies listen to me and they'll see how I be
Yo, Wapu, shake that bang, I'm looking and listening
Hustle through it, ballroom to it, yo, go do it
All in all is how you move, it gets in your soul
Put your hands up, shake it like you ten years old
Ay-ya-hay, get low, get low
Ay-ya-hay, to the flow, to the flow
Ay-ya-hay, get low, get low
Ay-ya-hay, to the flow, to the flow
Ay-ya-hay, get low, get lower
Ay-ya-hay, to the flow, to the flow
Ay-ya-hay, get low, get low
Ay-ya-hay, to the flow, to the flow
Get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow
Get low, get low, get low, get low, get low (Wah, ay-yah-hay) to the flow, to the flow (Wah, ay-yah-hay) get low, get low (Wah, ayy-yah-hay) to the flow, to the flow (Wah, ayy-yah-hay), get low, get low (Wah, ayya-hay) to the flow, to the flow, (Wah, ayya-hay) get low, get low (Wah, ayya-hay) to the flow, to the flow (Wah, ayya-hay) get low, get low (Wah, ayya-hay) to the flow, to the flow (Wah, ayya-hay) get low, get low (Wah, ayya-hay) to the flow, to the flow (Wah, ayya-hay), get low, get low (Wah, ayy-yah-hay) to the flow, to the flow (Wah, ayya-hay)
