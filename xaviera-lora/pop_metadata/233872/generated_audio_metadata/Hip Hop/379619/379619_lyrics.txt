I'm in the Zona Zona Al Capone
I'm in the Zona Zona Al Capon
I'm in the zone, the zone of Al Capone
Not always right, right or wrong
Cyclone just might, just like the brightest sun
Like the lightest gun, the righteous one
There can only be one, our war has begun to draw blood
Sweet sweet blood, the sweet street blood
The street needs to fill lungs, it's obvious
Them I need to control the markets
So I need to mark some targets
With some guns I can rise above the crumbs
And succumb to the numbness of new thumbprints
I'm in the zone, zone, zone of Al Capone
I'm in the zone, zone, zone of Al Capone
I'm in the zone, the zone of alcohol
I feel powerful anger
An itchy trigger finger
That triggers my pistol anger
There's great power in my pistol
I wished for a fistful
At the core of my crystal
Keep it tight with the combination lock pick
They say don't knock it'til you shot it
Shot samples of high caliber hot steel
I'll reveal when this deal is sealed
Take the money and we'll buy some guns
Firepower to push my mission on a mission
Make the money and we'll buy more guns
Firepower (I'm in the zone, zone, zone of Al Capone)
I'm in the Zona Zona Al Capone
I'm in the Zona Zona Al Capon
I'm in the zone, zone, zone of Al Capone
I'm in the zone, zone, zone of Al Capone
