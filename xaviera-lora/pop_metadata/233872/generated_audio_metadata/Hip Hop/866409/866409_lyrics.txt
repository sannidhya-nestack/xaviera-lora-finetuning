What keeps me up at night is keeping my game tight
They wanna take my life
All cause I'm just doing right
Winning playing by the rules
They took me for a fool
Just gotta play it cool
Work hard and stay in school
Final notices from collection agencies saying
"Here's what's your O + interest or we'll take your things"
What's that supposed to mean? I can't afford to pay a crook
So the 99s and overtime store lay fees are overlooked
My granddad once said they don't even wanna sit biased
What to me? More like they don't wanna
What's the point of even being black if your neighbor's priority is seeing you dead or under arrest
And being raised by minimum wage will filter bad habits
Or teach you the hard lesson if you want it you better grab it
Nothing handed to you in this life, it what you get
Cause you're black and beat the case because you white, accountability's a one way street
In the projects you witness murder and the cops threatening you for your silence
To make it in this cruel world just put fairness in your rear view
And let the thought of you making it big the reason people fear you
What keeps me up at night is keeping my gaze high
They wanna take my life
All cause I'm doing right
Waiting playing by the rules
They took me for a fool
Just gotta play it cool
Work hard and stay in school
Think the chorus is corny but these words are what kept a young brother steady scoring
Girls in junior high used to say that kid is boring
Now look at my business story they all but ignored
I remember sixty hours at one job twenty at another
And being a full time student and looking back
From the outside looking in
I still can't believe that man there was able to do it
Started out with a vision turned it into a living
Told my mama I'd make it no matter how long it take me
Finished college in four years part of my life went by fast
Funny when all goes by slow till all of sudden it's my past year
Shout out to every teacher who told me I could be good at whatever
It be English and 5th grade spelling test made these lyrics more clever
When you chasing the cheddar
It's difficult trying to settle
Cause with every single letter you feel
Magic coming together
What keeps me up at night
Is keeping my game tight
They wanna take mine
All cause I'm doing right
Winning playing by the rules
They took me for a fool
Just gotta play it cool
Work hard and stay in school
