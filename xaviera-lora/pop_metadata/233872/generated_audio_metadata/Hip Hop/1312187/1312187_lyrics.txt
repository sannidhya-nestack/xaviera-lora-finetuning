Check the beat while I'm stepping out
Sunshine colors no room for doubt
Melody sweet with a honey gold flow
Smiling like I mean it let that radiance show
Saffron sky in my eyes feel that bliss ignite
Groove into a rhythm that's steady and bright
Every ray in my day sparks a carefree high
Soft from the sky in my eyes I'm soaring so fly
Check the beat of the beat
Check the beat of the beat
Check the beat of the beat
Check the beat of the beat
Dancing on a whim, got a sparkle in tow
Each verse ties a ribbon'round the joy I know in you
Clouds in my path, only breezes of cheer
A glow in my heart telling me I'm right here
Saffron sky in my eyes, feel that bliss ignite
Groove into a rhythm that's steady and bright
Every ray in my day sparks a carefree high
Saffron sky in my eyes, I'm soaring, so fly
Chach-te-te-te-te-teem
Chach-te-te-te-tee-teem
Chach-te-te-te-teem
Chach-te-te-te-tee-teem
Saffron sky, saffron sky
It's the color of my body
Never letting it die
I'm lost in the gold
Tapping into my soul
In the hush of the moment
I'm feeling so whole
South front sky in my eyes
I let gratitude ring
Basking in this light
This is how I sing
Ja de de de de de
Ja de de de de de de
Jack, they did it again
Jack, they did it again
Jack, they did it again
Jack, they did it again
It's the color of my vibe never letting me die
It's the color of my vibe never letting me die
I'm lost in the gold tapping into my soul
In the hush of a moment I'm feeling so whole
Saffron sky in my eyes I let gratitude ring
Basking in this light this is how I sing
Jack the deep dead dead dude
Jack the deep dead dead dude
