Did you ever have a wish for a girl who could inspire?
A ten thousand year itch of hella hot desire?
Let me introduce you please to a girl who fits the bill
I think she took the little red pill
She's a sight to see, miss money
A smile worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She's stuck in Ohio shoes, life's gotten better she got everything to lose
Fashion's so fine, you have to get an airplane seat at what cost?
Lost a pretty penny, come and get some, would you like a little treat?
Turnips everywhere, trust me, there are very, very many
She's a little more than filthy rich, one tough bitch, welcome to the sweetness
Oh Miss Money, you're one sexy sweet honey
Is it a thing that you adore Miss Money?
Now you got a little, would you like a little more? (Miss Money)
Sweet little honey, I can see that you are vetched
Take a minute, check your mobile, tell me if you got my toast
Don't just go finessing, I can see that you've been messing with some things
I think you think that you never save up the gold
She got a wallet that is quite a little fatty
Generous she is, very very very catty
Buying up the love, it's something that she can never seem to get enough of
Of a swipe of a card, like to play the part
Crashing it very hard in the market for a heart
Oh, Miss Money, you're a fantasy
I think about you every day
I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person
To a person in your life
Maybe you're a girlfriend, maybe you're a wife
Miss Money, oh, she's no dummy
Lies love, but it's never ever chummy
With the twinkle of green in her eyes
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
She's got a stockpile of sweet admirers
They're all just the assets that are fueling her desires
Trace her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment, not selling just to park it
Her laughter rings like a cash register chime
The loves of currency she can't seem to mine
A portfolio of hearts, oh what a portfolio
But the David fans of love, she'll never really know
Miss Money, oh she's no dummy
Buys love, but it's never ever chung me
What's the equal of greed in her eyes?
She's a fiscal ferry fluttering by
A market of romance, she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold, they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But all hell she'll spend to seize
She's a penny pitcher with a golden touch
But the cost of love, it seems too much
Miss Money, oh, the irony's not lost
Can't budget for love, it's an endless cost
Now she's bankrupt in the market of hearts
A fiscal failure torn apart
But oh, Miss Money, you're still a sight
In the cold hard cash of the night
Miss Money, oh, she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of green in her eye
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
So here's to Miss Money
A doll on the phone and your ass is feeling wet
Miss Money, oh she's no dummy
Buys love, but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of green in her eye, she is a business fairy fluttering by
So here's to Miss Money, the belle of the ball, may your assets be liquid
