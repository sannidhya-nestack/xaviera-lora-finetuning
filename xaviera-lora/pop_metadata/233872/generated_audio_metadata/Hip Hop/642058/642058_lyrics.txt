Salute, salute, salute, salute, salute, salute
Yeah they try to slip kryptonite in my drink
Prayin' I get sick tonight but I'm here
And if you don't give a shit like I don't give a shit
Put your motherfuckin' hands in the air
Stay on that money hose and close me too
I'm growin' roses in the concrete
To the earth in my hands and the sun up under my feet
Settled for a week in Puerto Rico at least
Added recliner to my rider so I can kick my feet
Driver like PSD, I don't like the backseat
Less you talkin' 62, 57's at least
Yeah life attract me, I let myself get out of shape
Back on my calisthenics, my version of moving weight
Past is in the trash, future bright solar
Flow masters, V12's, Harley bike, Mopar
Thots and triceps chisel
I fuck around and change my name to Zeus on y'all
Rolling stones, I'm roaming with rich transients
Big whales backstage, me Larry'bout these laminate niggas
Red lights, feel the ambience
Room full of Bubba Kush stimulants and young Pam Andersons
These white girls, they on that white girl
These Hilton's and Lohans, they go cold man, call me snowman
He get they nose numb, I ounce be looking like a way out where I'm from
Salute to the ones that made it
Now I ain't hitting, but I'm on your ass
Meet your new neighbors and don't be afraid to salute me back
We moving on up, we got to get to get up outta here now
I said we moving on up, in my world you either get up or lay it down
Disco round, we foil the plan of haters, spoil my family rotten
I et the haters, but a traitor's never otten
Been through the ringer, numb to the crying, stop it
Stood in the hurricane's iris like it was nothing
I think I'm Phil Ivey, and when the chips down you find out who bluffing
The gang needed Kalanick, and I may not be the remedy
But I'ma make sure they don't et my name like a Kennedy
Tryna keep my head though, I used to love her
But lately we been lacking chemistry, I keep it Danny Glover
She keep on falling for the singers every single summer
I keep on calling her the bitch keep on changing the number
We both miss Biggie and Punz so it's Hope Steel
And most of these rappers would've been Machiavelli roadkill
They lacking heart so they music I don't feel
And we won't even bother to talk bars but I still give a salute
To the ones that made it now I ain't hitting but I'm on your ass
Meet your new neighbors and don't be afraid to salute me back
We got to get to get up out to him now
I say we moving on up
In my world you either get up or lay it down
I was politicking over lunch with Do
Kicking that young billionaire rap Mark Zuckerberg flow
Probably worth a hundred gold bullions
I pull tools on you rap new borns
Over the green like croutons
We got the one up
Cause we too strong, tripled up the chains
Cause I heard the third time's a charm
Nevermind the arm, my left wrist is a death wish
Like Charles Bruns, I ain't taking no bruns
Only gold medals in the blue when they got me looking like a ruin
to ruin what you doing, I ain't never sold pebbles
You can kick racks all through the kids block
I ain't with them fairy tales fella
You a lie teller
I'd rather lie tell em who new models on they back and fuck em till they cry yellin
Papi Chulo I remain Numa Uno
If you lay a finger on me then the army like the two toes
You the ones that made it
Nah I ain't hating
But I'm on your ass
Meet your new neighbors and don't be afraid to salute me back
We moving on up, we got to get to get up out of here now
I said we moving on up, in my world you either get up or lay it down
