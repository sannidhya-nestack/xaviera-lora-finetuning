Man, I just heard the saying
Don't worry if people don't like you
Most people are struggling to like themselves
Clock in, lock it in a new day
A breath of fresh air in a new phase
Smell the aroma of life's whip appeal
Touching it on many levels you will get the feel
The real, time to open up the seal
So many letters to endeavor on a meal
It's a give and take when it comes to grace
I pray that every heart will awake
The sleeping giant so defiant in alliance
I saw the world cry over Kobe Bryant
G e Floyd, many others, we saw the void that exists
Let justice be the main fix
No competition on a mission to bring back
What was rightfully theirs as ancients on the map
The attacks should be lessons to all people
Under the creator's eyes we are all equal
When the struggle is real, real as it gets
You feel like going under, never another breath
How many hearts understand, are you really?
Need to talk to someone, do you hear me?
When the struggle is real, real as it gets
You feel like going under, never another breath
How many hearts understand, are you really?
Need to talk to someone, do you hear me
So many fell asleep, never wishing to complete
What was dealt to them, the root cause
Or the stem, touch the hem
The woman with the issue of blood
Got out of her comfort zone
She fell all alone
But the love, the virtue
The healing from above
Was connected by her faith
A saving grace
Now today
Look at the hatred in the face
Cause you stand for what belongs to you
In the first place
Hypocrites
So pious they're sniffing it
Giddy up on the high horse where's the kick
Send them back too you know of that too
Ain't no pill to talk you need to smack you
Ignorance is a bliss that has impact you
What is the real you what you gonna do
What was meant to do only but of you
But when you put it into action gotta see it through
Struggle is real, real as it gets
You feel like going under, never another breath, ah
How many hearts understand, are you really?
Need to talk to someone, do you hear me?
When the struggle is real, real as it gets
You feel like going under, never another breath, ha
How many hearts understand, are you really?
Need to talk to someone, do you hear me?
Everybody has a tipping point, come and join
Think back when it was a matter of fact
Facts can change but the truth remains
History has a way of talking, so evident in the stains
The bloodshed, the living bread on the meds
It's like a sniff on the drug going straight to your head
Many can't see clearly now they still soaked in the rain
Drowning in their own pain, the migraine
Metaphorically siren, sound the alarm, heavenly arm
When the smoke glares, you see who really cares
When there's no more fanfare, a multitude of chairs
Crosses to bear, moments to share
Power of love and a sound mind
Versus to fear, persevere
Even if you gotta shed a tear
It doesn't make you any lesser of a person
Draw near
Struggle is real, real as it gets
You feel like going under, never another breath, ha
How many hearts understand, are you really?
Need to talk to someone, do you hear me?
When the struggle is real, real as it gets
You feel like going under, never another breath, ah
How many hearts understand, are you really?
Need to talk to someone, do you hear me
When the struggle is real, real as it gets
You feel like going under, never another breath, ha
How many hearts understand? Are you really?
Need to talk to someone, do you hear me?
When the struggle is real, real as it gets
You feel like going under, never another breath, how?
How many hearts understand? Are you really?
Need to talk to someone, do you hear me
