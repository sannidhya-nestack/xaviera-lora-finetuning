You better get lit when I plug it in the system
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake Up!
A thousand voices, a thousand people, a thousand oceans
Universe, ideal, a million prophets, a million men
A million continents, I felt it then
I can see with my eyes closed the sky's gold
And my high's the limit isn't it
Is the limitless potential unlimited
Or limited to indiscriminate attacks that are imminent
Preeminent domain
Earthquake awakening
Earth shattered my birthplace
The first base awakening
I act out my dreams as a disease
When I sleep I can conceive and believe in
A thousand voices speaking as one voice
Saying one word that will unite
Two men to ignite liquid nitrogen
Three men unite to fight the Hydro Twin Phenomenon
Wake up to this song of a thousand voices (wake up)
When you did not listen to his sorrow (wake up)
When he did not find his soul (wake up)
One particular voice (wake up)
An absorbed light sound (wake up)
Wake up, just wake up, wake up, come on, wake up, wake up, just wake up, wake up, just wake up, wake up, just wake up, wake up, just wake up, wake up, just wake up, wake up, just wake up, wake up, just wake up, wake up, just wake up, wake up, just wake up, wake up, just wake up, wake up, just wake up, wake up, just wake up, wake up, just wake up, wake up, just wake up, just wake up, wake up, just wake up, just wake up, just wake up, just wake up, just wake up, just wake up, just wake up, just wake up, just wake up, just wake up, just wake up, just wake up, just wake up, just wake up, just wake up, just wake up, just wake up, just wake up
