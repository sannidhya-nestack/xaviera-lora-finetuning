Oh yeah, nickel, check it out
Pardon Mr. Impeccable
Can I intersect for a sec or two
On this mic I came to wreck for you
These words just like a weapon dude
All due respect to you
Payin' homage to these genres
Too many out there are dishonest
We like music, Dalai Lamas
Not too fond of prima donnas
Who only do this for their commerce
On that even though sadomas
Could foresee this holy fusion
If they see they only choosin'
Trap they souls all in confusion
While an optical illusion
I throw that as night vision
Stay mic rippin'
That's how my life has been written
Words from the sages, now this wisdom is contagious
Not concerned who's on the A-list
Freedom from these cages, outrageous allegations
The truth has been compromised and the youth has been traumatized
And the earth has been monetized, it's a spiritual homicide
It's only music that can save us, animalistic type behaviors
These things can't get you nowhere
You feelin' hollow, oh yeah, I'm a universal soldier
Ain't relyin' on your Prozac just to roll out of your beds
Maybe sold out to the feds, aren't you all out of regrets?
This is all cause and effect, wrong turns can get you burned
And it's sad'cause someone never learned'til they ashes in a urn
T-zeens just dropped dead, messin' around in the hotbed
So many stars I can hardly believe
I don't even know who you are and who you are
So many stars and I'm not a machine
I don't even know who you are anymore
I don't even know who you are
You wanna mess with me
I got the things you need
You got a friend in me
