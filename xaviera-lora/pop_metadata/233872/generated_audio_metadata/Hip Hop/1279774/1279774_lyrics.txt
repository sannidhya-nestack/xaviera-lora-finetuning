Leave a legacy, tell em that I'm tryna leave a legacy
Been questioning what I want in my lifetime
If you know me you know music been my life grind
I am blessed to see an age where many men perish
If not they sitting in a cell like all they truly cherish
Get rich or die trying not trying to get rich quick
My two sets quickly turning into fifty cent
I got it all over the game that's a lil flip
They couldn't stand where I stand cause they not equipped
Just visited my niece and nephew way up in Ohio
You feeding those kids too with that link in my bio
Spent these last few months just searching for answers
Don't do this for the money more for the legacy standards
Your face dirty but you did that for the big faces
Everywhere I go they said I blow feel like I rig places
The older that I get the more I realize
Rather keep my respect than have my morals compromised
I watched a homie turn away a million
To not appear like a hero doing business with villains
Still for something I'll be sitting at the dinner table
Can't wait to tell my grandkids about the realer fable
That's why I be accountable with all the fathers
You hold the future when you teaching your son and your daughter uh
Hold them to high standards cause they got your name on it
Rap on beats to have fun but give game on it uh
Tell'em that I'm tryna leave a legacy
In no rush to get what God meant for me
Get inside the booth and treat it like therapy
Rappin' for respect and I'm rappin' for the clarity
And the fact I'm tryna leave a legacy
Hope it's love when y'all sayin' love and memory
Embrace it all while you got your dick with destiny
And when you talkin'bout me say he did it all verily
Did you stay true? Did you stay real?
You here for more than to go to school and pay off some bills
I show my scars, hope to help another person out
Growing as a man, I'm a brand new person now
Paying tributes to all of my tribulations
Can't wait they see they faces, saying that young Rilla made it
I'm past the glory dog and the fame chasing
More into telling truths, more into pain facing
Plus the fact I'm tryna leave a legacy
Ain't no rush to get what God meant for me
Get inside the booth and treat it like therapy
Rapping for respect and I'm rapping for the clarity
And the fact I'm tryna leave a legacy
Hope it's love when y'all singing love and memory
Embrace it all while you got your dick with destiny
And when you talk about me say he did it all, barely (yeah)
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
The absolute part of each
