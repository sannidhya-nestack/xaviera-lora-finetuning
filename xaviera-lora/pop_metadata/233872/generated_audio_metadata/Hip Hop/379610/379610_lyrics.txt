Revolutions coming slow in increments, rotates and grows
Ideas voiced and stacked together, speech is tough and thick as leather
No stop and no end, spins around until it bends
Corn of change, it seeds and grows
Can't be stopped, can't be imposed
War and conquer our creation
Erratic retaliation
Population overflows
Misfortune it moves and grows
See choice before it's made
You and I we can be saved
You know it's gonna happen
From the sticks up to Manhattan
Only two ways to save the world
Destroy us all now or unfurl
Step aside to let it begin
The change has got to start within
Only two ways to save the world
Destroy us all now or unfurl
Step aside to let it begin
The change has got to start within
