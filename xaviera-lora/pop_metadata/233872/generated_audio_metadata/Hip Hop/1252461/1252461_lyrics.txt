Like all the other worlds, I feel the shift inside
A slow awakening of a power I cannot hide
The moon's soft whisper echoes through my mind
A call to embrace
I am the threshold between two worlds apart
A bridge of flesh and blood that beats within my heart
I am the paradox of light and dark combined
A mystery that's mine to define
The nightmare carries
The scent of my desire
A longing to surrender
To a hot seductive fire
The flames that fuel
The passion that I hold
A burning need to break free
From this place I've been controlled
I am the crossing
Where two realities meet a heart that pulses
A dark and steady beat, I am the union
Of black and white combined
The werewolf calls for you
And I'm in the darkness of your vampire mind
Ooh, ooh, the werewolf calls for you
I am a werewolf, I am a werewolf, a werewolf, a werewolf, a werewolf, a werewolf, a werewolf
