Listen to this song, come on
Walking on the streets of the night city
I am meeting girls who are such pretty
After I see a beautiful Bentley
And I hear a woman's voice
Is she calling me?
Yes, it's true that she's calling me
Mr. Tango, could you be in a photo with me?
I'm giving an answer
Sure, let's go
Taking this photo you start feeling this flow
Where everything looks pretty
It looks beautiful only in the night
And the life is going right, right, right
Then she ask me to get into her car
The answer is gone, maybe I'll going to the bar
After that she is becoming such happy
But I'm glad only to sit with you baby
She's driving so fast, wow she is the best
I'm walking out this car, cause we're going far and far
It always capture me, keep on playing this CD
It doesn't matter what you see in Apple TV
Only in the night you can see these lights
It will always fool your memory bytes
One wish, one motion, one atmosphere
We don't wanna get out of here
I just wanna stay here all time
During this period I won't do any crime
Don't et that beauty makes your life go well
This is one important message I should tell you
Where everything looks pretty
It looks beautiful only in the night
And the life is going right, right, right
By the way we see another cast and dance bars
Near all that there are different parts of music
People noise and crazy dances
In this city everybody has chances
To live the life that is desirable
And to make it be very reliable
Cause everything is possible when you want it much
After your desire becomes your life crush
Well now I think it's time to party
Come on girl just shake your body
You are dancing, I am dancing
And we becoming more and more brazy
I just want this night go long
To let this pleasure going on
Ok, the time has come to relax
And to et about all of these checks
This is a big night city
Where everything looks pretty
It looks beautiful only in the night
And the life is going right, right, right (Call me up, say)
This is such a big city
And the life is going right (Call me up, say)
This is such a big city (Big night city)
And the night skies are red
