It don't be feature
No one in particular
Oh Lord
I am dry in this desert made with my own hands
And every time I reach for the sky
My heart just sinks here in the sand
But I don't know how I wound up here
You gave me such good directions
I started to stray
And then I lost my way
I need a touch of your affection
Send your mercy
Send your grace
Let your power fall
Watch over us all
Some will say
Look around, what's all this?
Many others have joined my journey
With blanks in their eyes, still they criticize
Yet for a speck they think they see, why can't we?
Lift ourselves from this mess, why can't we give up all this strife?
This desert is dry and we're all gonna die without the water of life
Send your mercy, Lord, send your grace
Let your power fall, wash over us all, send your mercy
We, whose tongues are sharper than swords
We dig a pit in the path of others
And then we fire right in
We gotta cry out to the Lord
Send your mercy, yeah
Send your grace
Let your power fall
Wash over us all
Send your mercy
Send, Lord, send, yeah
Send your grace
Let your power fall
Wash over us all
Send your mercy
Oh Lord
Send your mercy, Lord
