Never thought that I would see it in my lifetime
People walking in the dark and their mind is blind
Negativity and sensitivity is a crime
90's haters clock blocking and they drop and die
Never thought that I would see the day
The sky opened up when we prayed
Night in heaven, clock ticks close to eleven
Pretty smile in the mirror makes you feel like a felon
And outside the window starts a brand new day
While you're sleeping there's more to it just coming your way
And the day will come, light will shine from above
Children's voices will fill our hearts with love
And the money will come and it will rain with gold
Life will fill the stories yet untold
Never thought that I would see the day
The sky opened up when we prayed
I never thought, I never thought, I never thought that I would see the day
And the day will come, light will shine from above
Children's voices will fill our hearts with love
And the money will come and it will rain with gold
Life will fill the stories yet untold
When table rings you can hear the chimes
And the angel gets his wings in divine time
So many roads to travel, too many miles to climb
In between love and hate there's a fine line
I'm blessed and got the victory and yes I'm grateful
That I'm able to put it on the table
I'm married to this game and yes I'm faithful
