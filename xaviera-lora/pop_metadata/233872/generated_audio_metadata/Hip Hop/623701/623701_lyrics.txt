This feeling got me high, better keep it on the low
When the world is passing by like we flying
But what will pull me down if my dream is still around
And I feel like I am found
Yeah, I don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world, yeah
Yeah, I don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Yeah, I've been down that dead end road
The hard times would test my soul
Never thought that I'd get so close to the top
And I'd have to stop and reset my goals
But now I know nothing comes for free
Rockin' with a team that is loved for me
Can't be out of the loop, gotta be up to speed
Life is filled with these custom dreams
Trust that we could make this better
Define the lines between pain and pleasure
Blessed to be alive everyday I treasure
The world is ours so we can change it forever
I seen the light now I seen the dark
And the demons tried to kill my beating heart
But it was faith in God that would keep me smart
So before I die I will leave my mark
I will take a stand and speak words of truth
Even if I get beat up, burnt to bruise
Even if I get put down, hurt or chewed
Cause being myself is what I learned to do
So I will earn my spot in this beautiful place
I will work my songs and I will choose to be great
I'm living this up in a musical way
And I do it to praise and I do it for change
Swimming got me high, better keep it on the low
When the world is passing by like we flying
But what will pull me down if my dream is still around
And I feel like I am found
Yeah, I don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Yeah, yeah, I don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Have you ever thought you had the strength to play the major role and get off the bench
But in the time that it is in you live a life that let you believe that you can
So you drop and et the dream you were born to live in and you're torn to think
I got to survive, afford some things but then you end up bored and pissed
And look at your life, the city itself, there's gotta be more to this
I've been there, done that, been scared, once trapped
Never thought that the feeling would come back
But when I top of the world I fell down cause we all know that everybody does crash
We living a way where we sleep on potential dreams are the key to your mental
We're greater than what we can get through whatever we fear is let's leave them and let loose
Working so hard, living it up and becoming a man
This is my heart, giving it nothing but loving this rap
Uncovered a chance, get lost in these beats now I'm under a trance
Hoping I'm found, creating colors on tracks
Taking me up in a flash
You say they got me high, better keep it on the low
When the world is passing by like we flying
But what will pull me down if my dream is still around and I feel like I am found
Yeah, I don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Yeah, yeah, I don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
I spent my time searching
For a feeling that I never knew
I'm not the same person
Yeah, I've changed
Now my soul I will never lose
Used to spend my days asleep, always chilling
Now I'm staying chasing dreams, with ambition
My struggles have made me see
Now I'm sitting on a cloud, thinking out loud
Living so proud because
This feeling got me high, better keep it on the low
When the world is passing by like we flying
But what will pull me down if my dream is still around
And I feel like I am found
Yeah, I don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Yeah, yeah, I don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
This feeling got me high
Better keep it on the low
When the world is passing by like we flying
But what will pull me down if my dream is still around
And I feel like I am found
Yeah, I don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world, yeah
Yeah, I don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Yeah, I don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world, yeah
Yeah, I don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
Don't wanna be lost up in this world
