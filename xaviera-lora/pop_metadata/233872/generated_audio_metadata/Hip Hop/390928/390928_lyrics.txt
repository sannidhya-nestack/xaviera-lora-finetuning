Hey, there's an artist by the name of Minister Kane (Hold up, let me tell you something)
I think he has that rugged, you know, rough urban sound that we're looking for (Do you know who you're talking to?)
It's like a twist between maybe DMX and the Dayton family
He's on some type of deal but I'm pretty sure we can get him out (I'm on the line, I'm on the phone)
Life is hard enough without having to dream
Pistols popping, empty pockets, dying for cream
Long was the road ahead, my eyes couldn't see it
Tears were blinding me, I'm stuck so be it
Imitating Michael Jackson, fiending for moves
Dancing'til I couldn't breathe,'cause the gap was so smooth
Every time I saw a stage, it sucked me into it
Moral talent shows was all I knew, I'm used to it
Love to turn tables, but I could not scratch
So like a statue I folded my arms and played the back
Was up on the stage, they passed me the mic
I started reciting the rhymes I wrote from last night
Everybody was hyped at how I spit the rhyme
Now I'm battling in the classroom and in the lunch line
Click up and join the group, we were platinum bound
Didn't know at the time it wasn't how you used to listen to my demo
He says this one line, you know something like "I'm cocky like Rocky"
Can you listen to my demo?
All this time I was writing, ready to score a lick
But the times had changed, wrote about the dope game
How I flipped it and cooked it, rocked it and served it
Boulders for your shoulders in a 5 .0 Swervin'
In studios all night, tryna make it tight
Sweatin' and strugglin', rappin' with all my might
Had to put it on hold and stack up some chips
Manager was gettin' no shows to run my lips
So it's back to the streets, supportin' my habit
No opportunities for me, so I couldn't grab it
Lacing tracks for demos, low budget studios
No mix on my vocals, they didn't care, I'm just local
I'm starving like Marvin, stuck in this game
Hopin' I'll make it somewhere before I'm blown out the fire
And you ask why he drinks, maybe why he smokes
To keep his sanity and not kickin' you low (Please listen to my demo)
We'll get a publicist to hype him up, you know, make him look like he's busy (We can't give our son money)
Can you listen to my demo? (We'll get him on Star Search, we'll get him on Rap City Beats) (Get him on the phone now)
Please listen to my demo
I'm pretty sure MTV-TRL will give us a spot with this guy (Yeah, they'll do it, they'll do it)
Can you listen to my demo?
I mean, he's the best thing since sliced bread (They'll do it for me)
Listen, man
You can keep your advance, front me more meat
It might take a little longer but uh you'll see
How you gon show me truth and nails
Off my dream
Buy me a Cadillac while y'all make all the cream
I sent mail to your companies, knocked on your doors
Diggin deep for 500 to open the show
So I gotta rap this to hit they playlists
All about a B4 or this, a pop of some crisp
Gon expose you with this tech, hope you wearing your vest
Keep your A &R's you check until you give up
Respect, we know you holding for hostage our demos
And pictures of us in the jail pose
Recognize you got poets, lyricists on the mic
We might be tangled up in shuffle but we get it right
Got hot ones for you companies that straight to the spine
Please consult your lawyer before you go
Please listen to my demo
What they don't understand is that we make artists every day
Can you listen to my demo?
It's like natural, duh, can you see the TV shows?
Please listen to my demo
I mean, we'll get this guy out the hood into suburbia, he'll be okay
Can you listen to my demo?
I mean, I really gotta have this guy, I mean, call him up on the phone, thanks
Please listen to my demo
Hey, have a seat, have a seat, have a seat
I know we'll get it, we'll get it
Can you listen to my demo?
Sit down, let me tell you, you green on this stuff (I agree, just do whatever you have to)
Please listen to my demo
You don't know nothin' (Make sure you get him to sign that contract)
Can you listen to my demo?
Hey, out of my office now (We can hold him for at least seven years)
Man, hang up on that fool
I don't know who he is, who is that bucky?
Huh?
Hang up on that fool
Man, I'm outta here
