(Freaks)
Sensationalize, sensationalize
Legal limitations and the justice dies
Fascinating story'bout the way it began
Recall the smell of dirty money and a shitty tent
Educated sucker with the money and the power
He would come with the crack, cold charge'em by the hour
Government official come sort it out
Marketing a drug-free America, no doubt
On to that black heaven thing this time
It ain't fine, it's time to open up your mind and open up your eyes
Electronically visualize (I wanna get high if I can only find the time)
Time to fly, time to cry, time to get mad busy wondering why
Time to watch the world through the devil's eyes
Look at all those freaks
Rolling round the streets with big beasts surrounded by freaks
Look at all those freaks
Living it up, living it up
Look at all those freaks
Rolling round the downtown streets
Look at all those freaks
Living it up, living it up
They capitalise and they capitalise
Cold filter manufactured alibis
Well I'm a sentimental sucker with a piece of the pie
And a thing or two to say about the how and the why
I wanna get ready and rehearse my parts
I wanna be ready when the freak show starts
Feel the rage as it hits the stage
Just like a good boy I join up a rave
Life like everything is fine
Fine it ain't fine
It's a congregation of freaks
With loyalty peaks and information leaks
Only key high if I can only find the time yeah
It's time to be, it's time to be free, it's time to be we
You see, look at all those freaks
Rolling round the streets
I can't compete with all the freaks
Look at all those freaks
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Look at all those freaks
Rolling round the downtown streets
Look at all those freaks
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Living it up, living it up, living it Up
Living it up, living it up, living it UP
My crimes are not crimes against you (legalize my crimes)
I don't believe in the things that you do (cause I don't believe in your ways)
Legalize cause I just don't get it (legalize my crimes)
It'll work if you let it (it'll work if you let it)
Look at all those freaks, living it up, living it up (they're living it up)
Look at all those freaks, rolling round the downtown streets
Look at all those freaks, living it up living it up
Look at all those freaks
Pullin' brown, pullin' brown, pullin' brown
Look at all those freaks
Pullin' brown, pullin' brown, pullin' brown
Look at all those freaks
Pullin' brown, pullin' brown, pullin' brown
Look at all those freaks
Pullin' brown, pullin' brown, pullin' brown
