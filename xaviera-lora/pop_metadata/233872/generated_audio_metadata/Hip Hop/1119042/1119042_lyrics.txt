Take the top down
Rolling with my shorty
Ride or die
I'll ride, I'll ride, I'll ride
Take the top down
Bonnie and Clyde
We ride, we ride, we ride
Bunny and Clyde, lakes on the side
Two birds on the fly, going cross county line
I'm a lost cause, walk the walk and don't stop
Mama didn't raise a fool to my dirt and don't talk
White collar crime, blue collar grind
Pray to Jesus everyday but I don't plan to change my life
Take it to the bank, all my paperwork is fake
Gotta make it on way in a motel safe
All I wanna do is cruise with you, cruise with you
Speak aloud with the top down, top down
Make it run'til the cash out, cash out
See me rollin' with my shorty, shorty
Ridin' dirty'til the morning, morning
Bonnie and Clyde, ride'til I die
Doing what it takes even if it ain't right
Two keys in the trunk, running with the system, boom
Stacking up, packing funds on the road on the run
I'm a lost cause, I was running from the cops
Ain't coppin' no plea, go down I won't talk
I'm on that midnight run (stack it, stack it)
I'm on that midnight run
I'm active
Speak aloud with the top down
Top down
Make'em runs'til they cash out
Cash out
See me rollin' with my shorty
Shorty
Ride and die till the morning
See me rollin' top down
Top down
Top down
Make'em runs'til they cash out
Cash out
See me rollin' with my shorty
Shorty
Ride and die till the morning
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
We gotta get up outta here
We gotta get up, get outta here, the coast is clear
Jump in the ride, the coast is clear
I hear the sirens, they're getting near, the coast is clear
It's getting late, I hear the sirens
You by my side, I know we're riding (you by my side, I know we're riding)
Wanna cruise with the top down (top down)
Make'em runs'til they cash out (cash out)
See me rollin' with my shorty (shorty)
Ride and die'til the morning (see me rollin', rollin')
Wanna cruise with the top down (top down)
Make'em runs'til they cash out (cash out)
See me rollin' with my shorty (shorty)
Ride and die'til the morning (see me rollin', rollin')
All I know is how to get this dough
I work hard for money
Like all the time
All I know is how to get this dough
I work hard for money
