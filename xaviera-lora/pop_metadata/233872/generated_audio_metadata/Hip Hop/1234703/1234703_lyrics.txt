I'm in the zone
I'm in the zone
Uh, chill girl, step in now
Lookin' does a fist in every stride
Every move purely us, sound delicious
They say beauty's in the eye
Mine's drama-ful-ous
In the mirror, who's the star?
Always missed an amazing lavish show
So hot it burns, call it plas-tacular
Walking hard, breaking hearts
In my fashion vernacular
Every word I spit is like a kiss of steel
Got'em lost in my world
Where my made up words dwell
Eyes, camera, action, see me gleam and glow
With a charm so charm-marvelous I steal the show
Lyric sharp, beats tight in my fantasy realm
A way of words like stunned, amazing hell
A vision in the night, a stone delicious sight
Our presence alone makes the darkness light
This time to love eyes from dusk'til dawn
Dawn of the dream you wish you never woke upon
I'm in the zone
All in this song
All in this song
All in this song
It's your girl, stepping out
Looking down the face and every stride
Every move clearly, I sound delicious
They say beauty's in the eye
Mine's drama-ful-ous
In the mirror, who's that slut?
So hot it burns, call it the fabula (walking pop)
Breaking hearts in my fashion vernacular (every word I spit is like I kissed a spell)
Got'em lost in my world where my made up words dwell
It's your girl stepping out looking dazzling
Every stride every move clearly that's time malicious
They say beauty's in the eye mind's charmed by the list
In the mirror who's the star oh it's this time amazing
Loud so hot it burns call it gristacular
Walking hard breaking hearts in my fashion vernacular
Every word I spit it's like I cast a spell
Got'em lost in my world where my made up words dwell
Made up words and my lexicons glow
Turning heads as I effortlessly flow
In this game I'm the queen watch my throne
With my dazzling fleece and style I'm in zone
Lights, camera, action see me gleam and glow
With the charms go try my bullets I steal the show
Livered sharp beats tight in my fantasy realm
Where words like slander maze and helm
A vision in the night, it's down below your sight
My presence alone makes the darkness light
The secular vibes from dusk till dawn
I'm the dream you wish you never woke up on
I'm in the zone
I'm in the zone
I'm in the zone
I'm in the zone
I'm in the zone
I'm in this hole
I'm in this hole
