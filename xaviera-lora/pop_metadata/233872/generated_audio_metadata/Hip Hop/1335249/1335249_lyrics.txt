We don't talk, we just stand on business
Slide with the fam, no need for permission
Ain't no cap, this is facts not fiction
Playing with the don, better know your position
Posted on the corner like a street sign
Grew up in the jungle where the beats grind
Talk tough but your team lookin' decline
I move weight but it's legal when the beat shine
Raised with a siren sing lullabies
Now I'm cashin' out while the others just fantasize
Big smoke never hide let the hammer fly
But I'd rather build wealth let the commas rise
Cold heart but the wrist got fire in it
In the trap I was flipping like a gymnast
Had to level up now I'm thinking logistics
Deals on the table now we talking statistics
No love for the fake or the informant
We was on goal while they stuck in the dormant
Now it's AMG when I slide through the morning
Champagne goals from a life that was storming
We don't talk, we just stand on business (that's it)
Hunter deep, move smooth with precision (no gimmicks)
Eyes low, still sharp with the vision
Came from the mud, now we stackin' up digits (stack cap)
We don't talk, we just stand on business
Slide with the fam, no need for permission
Ain't no cap, this is facts, not fiction
Playin' with the don, better know your position
That's it
Representing the blue dope, no bimits
