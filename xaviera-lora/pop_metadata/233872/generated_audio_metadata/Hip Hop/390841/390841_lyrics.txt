Cleverly collecting the essence of my consciousness
Precise with illusionary device
Critic to self art
Style self taught
Your brand store bought
Generic and coherent
Crowd looking like they need an anesthetic
Who beside a pathetic
Ever heard the word "edit"
Got's to do what I got's to do
Pull the curtain and pull the credit you through
Heard the name but nobody transmitted to your frequency
Head slides side to side when you saying
You've heard of me?
Hell naw
Move along with that same song
Exit the race with a taste of the glove across your face
This is war
You gotta play the part when you actin' (light, camera, action)
Quiet on the set, we regret to inform you the schedule program you seek
Has been replaced by something much more unique
We much more unique
I'm that breath of fresh air you've been needing to inhale, prevail
Over all evil in my life, blessed for being curious
This luxurious picture they paint isn't as great in the real world
Results vary, life can get scary when you pack it with guns, bitches and drugs
This is a love, yo, not a way to finance temptations that I can't overcome myself
I spend my time studying, observing, introspect, not worry bout the next person
If I find me, we'll find each other
Faith, not the marketing that keeps me safe
Trying to shake the stereotype my art breeds
You think you know, but my mind's a hard read
Everybody on that next level nonsense
Money involved and people can't grab the concept
Well maybe you know
And just cool with the fact, nowadays a n***a gotta have a crew and a gat
Chains instead of brains, objects instead of topics
I drop it, cause rap ain't worth my soul
I control, I demand more respect from a fan
I control, I demand more respect as a man
Scene one, rapper enters with a bottle of grits (sike)
I'm not the type that's gon' follow the script but uh
Music please
You gotta play the part when you actin'
Like camera action
Quiet on the fact we regret
To inform you the schedule program you seek
Has been replaced by something much more unique
We much more unique
So people may doubt me speak
This type of communication it ain't just noise
With our heads held high
A whole lot of poise we embrace
Every act in which we're given
From the hoe in the wall clubs
To the big city living
The confidence we exhale is another form of grace
It ain't to be confused with arrogance over style and taste
To define what's art
That's a matter of opinion
So I play my part
Try to keep y'all grinning
We never quiet on a set when the dot bell sounds
It's an action packed adventure till we lay the mics down
I regret to inform ya
But I think it's wise
So there's no confusion or compromise
No director yells cut when we hit the stage
No choreographer here to work her ass like slaves
There's a possibility that we gon' change your views
About the way hip-hop is supposed to groove
See I find myself living like Lesia Lee
Bouncing off the wall and doing what the hell I please
Infest me to a life of no strike
Never giving up hope cause I seen the light
We air tight the music's right and people hype
So it seems that when the lights hit my eyes
We don't get camera shot we lay our lights on the line
For your miracle tease everybody holla back
You gotta play the part when you actin'
Like camera action
Quiet on the set
We regret to inform you of schedule program you seek
As we're replaced by something much more unique
We much more unique
Mastering the craft of skillful thought
Welcome to the final part on this miracle art
Looking scared on your mark set falling apart from the start
Life lesson play the progressions
We season in session competition green in first branch
First fall off like first glance
I enhance disclose realness expose natural style arose path I walk I chose
Posed in your clothes looking nice with the ice
Action figure stature all merchandise
Style plastic coated you a hollow shell molded
Like what you quoted
Wonder who wrote it
You'll see.
