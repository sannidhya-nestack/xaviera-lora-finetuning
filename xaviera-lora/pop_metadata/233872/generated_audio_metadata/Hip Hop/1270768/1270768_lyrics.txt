Calling all the beats on the run on the street
Under heat under pressure under everybody's feet
Now we making some deals chasing dreams burning bright
Like a blunt in the undertone hit beat
On the corner making plans time to shine it's in our hands
Back when we couldn't catch a beat now we're rising feels the heat
City lights flashing by, bow your head getting high
In the smoke filled alley telling stories of the past
Dreaming there will be tomorrow, promise hope lies
We'll never just believe until the sun hangs high
Catch a break in a world so fast
Hold on tight, make it last
Moving on up to our own song
Finally, finally, finally we belong
We belong
We belong
We belong
