Let's fly, let's fly
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
Fly, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you wanna ride with me, spread your wings and let's fly (let's fly, let's fly)
If you wanna roll with me, get on my side and let's ride (let's ride, let's ride, let's ride)
If you wanna ride with me, spread your wings and let's fly (yeah, oh)
You wanna roll with me, get on my side and let's ride (yeah, yeah, yeah)
The first seed, baby, back up in this, and back to business
I'm in the witness, I'm breaking records like I'm in Guinness, huh
You wanna rhyme with me? Go ahead, do your thing
You wanna shine with me? Go ahead, bling
Just step into the light, you'll see shine from my rhyme
I swear I'm getting closer, every time
I climb this mountain that's in front of me
No, I ain't a wannabe, what are the wanna-see?
It's the haters that's behind me sting
Like a honeybee, you want none of me
It ain't about a thing, I just wanna be free
To drop lyrics that lift spirits high into the sky
I'm on the edge, wings spread, ready to fly, come on
If you wanna ride with me, spread your wings and let's fly (let's fly, let's fly)
If you wanna roll with me, get on my side and let's ride (let's ride, let's ride)
If you wanna ride with me, spread your wings and let's fly
You wanna ride with me, get on my side and let's ride (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I, I stood the test of time, I stood the test of rhyme
That's why every rhyme and other test I'm in a mind
Spent nothing but the truth, okay, little lines
That's'cause I'm in the booth helping build this enterprise
Rhyme, invent a line designed to enter minds
Converting people to other representers of mine
So they can spread the word, something amazing occurred
First seeders, here the leaders, now it's making sense
No longer need to search, I'll take you all to church
I'll tell the congregation everything that I've learned
So you can come with me, into the sun with me
I'll help you break the chains, you will be one of the free
If you wanna ride with me, spread your wings and let's fly
If you wanna roll with me, get on my side, let's get high
If you wanna ride with me, spread your wings and let's fly
If you wanna roll with me, get on my side, let's get high (let's get high, let's get high)
If you wanna ride with me, spread your wings and let's fly (let's fly, let's fly, let's fly)
If you wanna roll with me, get on my side, let's get high (get high, get high, get high)
If you wanna ride with me, spread your wings and let's fly (let's fly, let's fly, let's fly)
If you wanna roll with me, get on my side, let's get high (let's get high)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah
