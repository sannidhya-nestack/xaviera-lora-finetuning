I told you that I'd make it but you ain't never believed me (believed me, believed me)
You used to tell me that I'm wasting all my time and money I just don't wanna be
Best believe I see you peeping me
Now you're crying late night right before you lay to sleep
Baby best believe
I told you that I make it but you ain't never believe me
You used to tell me that I'm wasting all my time and money I just don't wanna be
Best believe I see you peeping me
And now you're crying late night right before you lay to sleep
Baby best believe why you ain't believing me (why you ain't)
Why you ain't believing me (why you ain't, why you ain't)
Why you ain't believing me (why you ain' why you ain't)
Why you ain't believing me (why you ain't)
Why, why, why you angry?
I used to pop about your job on a Wednesday (it was good)
To show you what I'm on in this song that I just made (check this out)
But thirty seconds and you start talking'bout scandal (I hate that show)
That's how you treated all my dreams
But I got that handled (believe that)
I told you that I'd make it but you ain't never believed me
You used to tell me that I'm wasting all my time and money I just don't wanna be
Best believe I see you peeping me
And now you crying late night right before you lay to sleep
Baby best believe
Now these baddies acting crazy tryna reach me
Blowing up my phone why don't they die and meet me
Used to pull up on you late night white tee in my KD's
9 .5 on the mile in my shoes now tell me was that easy
Now do you believe me
I told you that I make it but you ain't never believe me
You used to tell me that I'm wasting all my time and money I just don't wanna beg
Best believe I see you peeping me
And now you cry late night before you lay to sleep (late night)
Baby best believe (believe that)
I told you that I'd make it but you ain't never believed me (believe me, believe me)
You used to tell me that I'm wasting all my time and money, I'm just a wannabe (I'm just a wannabe)
Best believe I see you peepin' me (I see you peepin' me)
And now you cry late night before you lay to sleep
Late night, late night, now you crying late night, late night, late night, now you crying late night
