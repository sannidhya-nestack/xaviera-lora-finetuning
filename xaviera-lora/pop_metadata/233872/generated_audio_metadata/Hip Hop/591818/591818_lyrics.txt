Uh, another day, another dollar, no
More like another day, another problem, yo
Homie, my pockets low, falling down like some dominoes
Wondering though when I'ma go die, get filled up with dominoes
Energy depleted, the synergy is leaving
But mentally I'm still a G, friends can be deceiving
Ministry is teaching, if you indeed are seeking
It's bigger business when you in this inner city region
Line'em up Donald Trump style, dumb it down
Coming south, popping up on an ounce at your mother's house
Try and make a couple thousand, politic and colon pal
Either you running or you slugging, homie, thug it out
That's in your mind state, crime rate increase
Never violate, object is to isolate the streets
Cause the product ain't for cheap, gotta lock from A to Z
Contemplating doing dirt, but that's not the way to be, homie
Yeah, I'm doing me, trying to make a dollar, be happy for two or three
Got my whole team with me, we been at it all week
We done made it through the fog, we finally gone see
Know what it's gone be, huh, I'm doing me
Trying to make a dollar, be happy for two or three
Got my whole team with me, we been at it all week
We done made it through the fog, we finally gone see
Know what's it gon' be
Strong will with an aura like a force field
Talk real do it all to build not at all for deals
Could pump grills if I needed to I keep it true
Creeping through drinking juice looking for a decent coupe to push back
Rappers getting bushwhacked for acting tough
Jack em up even if his album double platinum what
You ain't heard that I'm hard to be impressed
Tryna pardon me for press
But your R &B cassettes that I heartily respect
I do it for the love
Learning from the scholars and I'm schooling all the thugs
From computers to the clubs, I'm doing what I does
Deep root and never cheap, so they tutelage above
Keep it moving for the buzz, rap it manifests
Got these haters up in arms, so they handing me they checks
I intend to be the best, will never reconsider
If you think somebody better, disconnect with me on Twitter
Yeah, I'm doing me, try and make a dollar, be happy for two or three
Got my whole team with me, we been at it all week
We done made it through the fog, we finally gone see
Know what it's gone be, huh, I'm doing me
Try and make a dollar, be happy for two or three
Got my whole team with me, we been at it all week
We done made it through the fog, we finally gone see
Know what's it gone be
It's just a matter of time
Till I break down the barriers and shatter the lines
I had to recline they told me the rap was in a decline
But I looked in the mirror and saw the status was fine
I'm one of the last left
I'm here to ruin they mood just like some bad breath
Shouldn't have gave me access
Now I'm bout to catch rack and never will I half step
Charging y'all for verses bigger numbers than your address
Writing in my tablet tryna make a classic
Speaking of my pain and related to the masses
Dealing with the madness and everyday sadness
Yet I keep a smile cause the ending isn't tragic
Whipping through the traffic, heading to the HQ
I pay dues, I'm definitely gonna break through
I can't lose cause the victory is mine
The epitome of shine, my destiny is to rhyme uh
Yeah I'm doing me, try and make a dollar be happy for the rest of my life
Got my whole team with me, we been at it all week
We done made it through the fog, we finally gone see
Know what it's gone be, huh, I'm doing me
Try and make a dollar, be happy for two or three
Got my whole team with me, we been at it all week
We done made it through the fog, we finally gone see
Know what it's gone be, yeah, I'm doing me
Try and make a dollar, be happy for two
Got my whole team with me, we been at it all week
We done made it through the fog, we finally gone see
Know what it's gone be, huh, I'm doing me
Try and make a dollar be happy for two or three
Got my whole team with me, we been at it all week
We done made it through the fog, we finally gone see
Know what's it gone be
