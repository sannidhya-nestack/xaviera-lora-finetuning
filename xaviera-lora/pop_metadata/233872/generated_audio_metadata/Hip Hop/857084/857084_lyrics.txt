We came here to party with y'all (Jayshin, Layman, Light Up, Sicko)
Keep the swing alright, keep the mind alright
Keep it live all night, just keep thinking y'all
We came here to party with y'all (Jayshin, Layman, Light Up, Sicko)
You keep the swing alright, you keep the mind alright
You keep it live all night, just keep thinking
We came here to party with y'all (Jason, Layman, Light Up, Sicko)
You keep the swing all right, you keep the mind all right, you keep it live all night, just keep thinking
Party start jumpin' when this beat start bumpin', dirty south in this house
Gettin' it crooked, I got Honey's cootie poppin', chicken head droppin'
The neighbors is here, so we ain't gotta stop it
Bacardi Limon on the rocks,'cause I made it, toast it up
Don't hate it, the sunshine state, the FLA
All the way crossin' waters to the UK
We came here to party with y'all, don't you hate it?
You keep the swing all right, you keep the mind all right, you keep it live all night, just keep thinking
You know me, living like the truest that I can
I give it a man to be the guard holding your hand
And I see through the crystal, not all got the ball
So for those, let's help them to their toes when they fall
Swing it to the right, to the early morning light
When the dawn breaks in the face of a new day sight
Refresh with the mind blessed to release distress
Keep all peaks in step and bypass each other less
And if you keep it up, do what you do
G is gon' be a private after party for you by shit
And maybe she'll bring along a friend or two
And if you any good
And what you do is another time another place another session or two
The party don't stop the saga never ends
Just check your hotel, motel, quality and scope
We came here to party with y'all
Drink champagne and light up cigars
You keep the swing alright
You keep the mind alright
You keep it live all night just keep thinking
We came here to party with y'all
Drink champagne and light up cigars
You keep the swing all right, you keep the mind all right, you keep it live all night, just keep thinking
Keep the flow now, and hold each other down, cause we know now, we speak the same sound
Keep the flow now, and hold each other down, cause we know now, we speak the same sound
Turn it up a notch, two sips of johnny walker scotch, turn the AC up, party getting too hot
Honey's in the back, it's taking off they tops, and a line of cars outside is about to open
We came here to party with you, drink champagne and light up cigars
You keep the swing alright, you keep the mind alright, you keep it live all night just keep blinkin'
We came here to party with you, drink champagne and light up cigars
You keep the swing alright, you keep the mind alright
You keep it live all night, just keep thinkin' (We can't get too caught in a jam)
(We can't chase your mind and light up some guns)
You keep the swing alright, you keep the mind alright
You keep it live all night, just keep thinki'n (We can't get too caught in a jam
We can't chase your mind and light up some guns
You keep the swing alright, you keep the mind all right
You keep it live all night, just keep think'n
