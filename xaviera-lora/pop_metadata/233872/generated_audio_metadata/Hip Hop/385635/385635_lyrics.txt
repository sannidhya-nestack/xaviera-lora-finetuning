Fine as age wine, pimping on my mind
Check my watch, I got the time, what if you from behind?
Lovely as a morning on vacation, stress free
If she's got a couple shorties, that's cool with me
I'm gon' handle this like a man, there's so many wrong
Broke up so many homes, begging me back on the phone
Gotta fess up, I messed up
Many faithful young ladies, all because I got plucked early
It was crazy, now I know how to choose
Who to save and who to leave
Who to keep at a distance, who to hold and let cleave
This heart is so lonely, no one's in tune with me
Did I reject her years ago, too blind to see
Saw my soul full of drama, and they do it so smooth
I didn't know he wanted to see the kids after school
This heart is so lonely, no one's in tune with me
Did I reject her years ago, too blind to see
Sitting down to write you a letter
Sitting down to write you a letter
Sitting down to write you a letter
Sitting down to write
Remembering times I asked questions, can you be with me tonight?
Is your kids alright? I care then that's what you like
Rogues that's Capone, once I'm pushed in the zone
Calico for your baby daddy, leave me alone
Have you home by twelve, powder looking fresh male
Steak and cheese eggs for breakfast
Watch as juices well, maybe now it's too late
My heart is grew cold, when I want those emotions
They put me on hold, only if you knew
What this mans been through
You see why I'm out of reach, from my walk to my speech
Why I keep this door closed
Locked and shut in, yeah, you see a thug
But inside a crime man
Gotta protect my heart, she'll tear it in two
And say she scored one for the team
When she's through, why keep this door closed?
Locked and shut in, yeah, you see a thug
But inside a crime man
Sitting down to write you a letter (I hope you understand, I hope you understand)
Sitting down to write you a letter (I really do, I really do)
Sitting down to write you a letter (I mean, don't throw it away, don't throw it away, alright)
I wanna give you all the things you want in this life
Should I have to watch my back? No, that ain't right
My philosophy, trust no man, I trust you
You don't have to trust those ladies, trust me, boo
They can't open the door that I don't unlock
He can't push you to the edge if you tell him stop
Come and go with me
I show you the world, it's not about diamonds and pearls
But that's yours girl, been through a lot together
Guys and girls, whatever
Hurt my pride inside, felt like I had died
That's why I'm sitting here now, writing you this letter
Hoping this time we can stay together
It's been hard and I know it, no pain no gain
Wanna find you baby before I'm blown out the frame
That's why I'm sitting here now, writing you this letter
Hoping this time we can stay together
Sit down to write you a letter
Sit down to write you a letter
Sit down to write you a letter
Sit down to write you a letter
