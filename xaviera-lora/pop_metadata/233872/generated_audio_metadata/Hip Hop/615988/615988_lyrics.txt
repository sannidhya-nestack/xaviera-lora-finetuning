Everybody know you cold so you gotta stay on your toes
All they wanna do is just get in your clothes
So let a brother know if you down and you ready to roll
Baby we can go to south east maybe out to E
Ocean drive out Nikki beach
Baby we can take a seat in the dolo
Make sure you look fly as a dress code
In your dress show cardio
All the squats you've been working
Out you hot now you got all the looks
I'm addicted and I'm hooked
We can wait until the beach close
Take you to the room and then boom it's a peep show
Don't tease though I'm a freak yo
All the screams got you peaking through the peep hole
Dreams come true, if it's what you want baby I can make you come too
Do a run through, in my white tee, oh it's too big, try the white V
We can play a game of hide and seek, parking lot in the back of the Jeep
We can play a game of hide and seek, parking lot in the back of the Jeep
Just rock, rock, come through baby watch, watch
As she make her top pop, pop, and the headboard knock, knock
Just rock, rock, come through baby watch, watch
As she make the top pop, pop, and the headboard knock knock
Know a lot of girls have never met a woman like you
You stay fresh to death the way you dress is cool
You got me stressing you
Because you looking like your front page runway
Straight up out a video shoot
Got a ticket for two that we can hop in the coupe
You got me day dreaming all day thinking of you
You right out of bold
Even when you looking at me looking like you striking a pose
So yo you ain't know
Love to get a back massage once you hit the globe
Head to toe
She the best she the fresh baby girl nothing less than just dope
But we worlds apart
Everybody thinks she a dime she keep breaking my heart
Like we in the dark like I'm old school hip hop
Baby girls pop dreams come true
If it's what you want baby I can make you come too
Do a run through in my white tee
Oh it's too big try the wife bee
We can play a game of hide and seek
Parking lot in the back of the Jeep
We can play a game of hide and seek
Parking lot in the back of the Jeep
Just rock rock come through baby watch watch
As she make her top pop pop
And the headboard knock knock
Just rock, rock
Come through baby watch, watch
As she make the top pop, pop
And her headboard knock, knock, knock, let's go
