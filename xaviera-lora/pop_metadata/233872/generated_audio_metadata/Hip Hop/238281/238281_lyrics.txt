Lookin' back, how things got started
It's like paying homage to the
Dilly departed was my brother from another mother
Word to God, runnin' the same streets, avenues and dirty boulevards
Dealing with the same hard challenges, watch'em all do struggle
Pull together, create balances, knowin' talent is only half the battle
Rob had a wicked shot, and look what happened to him
Now they rappin' to him from the other side
On the block they wonder why, his son had to die
A nigga came and it's not that I'm tough, I chipped in
I bought some paint for the mural, flowers for the funeral and such
So touched, I depressed, babysat the Dutch
But fuck, in the end what you come down to?
Is it fate or the motherfuckers around you?
I know (I know) I know (I know) life goes on and on (life goes on and on)
I know struggle yeah, life goes on and on
Life goes on and on and on and on
But I know love, yeah
Life goes on and on
Just say you haven't lost the feeling
We all have plans, but life's a trip
I remember all we wanted was an R &B bitch
Maybe Mary J, Mariah, or Maya
Selling for them ones down by Grace Papaya
Out on the town feeling high then high
It was six in the morning, I ain't tired, I lied
A group of them hens just came outside
Cause the club ain't jumping so it's time to ride
Man them days is fresh in my memory
The vibe, the clothes, the chicks, the energy
The times, the shows, the risks, the synergy
The fights, the foes, the licks, the chemistry
Shit's history, mystery unsolved
How the world turns around and our lives evolve
And you most of all should know this fact
If you never had left
I know, I know, I know, I know, life goes on and on, life goes on and on, well I know struggle yeah
Life goes on and on, life goes on and on and on and on and on and on, life goes on and on
Well I know love yeah, life goes on and on
Just say you haven't lost the feeling
You know I'm catching feelings, cause nigga you lied
You said we putting the coat down, but look at you tried
By a judge and jury, run out of your piss
He threw the book at you, ayo for how many years?
For a quick buck, shit luck don't last that long
I looked up, you locked up, so I blast this song
How fast you gone, how can I pass this on
To the two little ones so they could grasp this wrong
And personally to me, it's more than that
We talked of going on tour when this rap shit crack
And all the parties and things that come with that
It's fucked up and on the real we can't do nothing with that
And I thought I had enough to plague my mind
When I got the call, take out pop, raise the spine
But nah, you had to put some icing on the cake
Could've found Jesus on the block, fuck up state, but I know
Damn son, I know I fucked this up, right?
I shoulda listened to you, but you know
You don't have to hold it down for me now, girl
I'ma be alright, do that
I know (I know) I know (I know) life goes on and on (life goes on and on) well I know struggle, yeah
Life goes on and on (life goes on and on and on and on and on and on) life goes on and on (life goes on and on) well I know love, yeah
Life goes on and on
