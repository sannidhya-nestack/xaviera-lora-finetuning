Yo man why don't you break me off a little son?
All I know and all I see
All I know and all I see
Straight love for the way your body's pumping in so many ways
Talkin' about non-weight that's somethin' with a bombay
For the fact that I roll like a roller loat
Excuse me miss you got me twistin' like some chronic smoke
Straight puffin' up on the fat one somewhat feelin' for your body
It's human nature to be deep low and downright naughty
See me fantasizin' about you and every little thing you do
If I could I would gotta be the one freakin' you
No second of thought but I'm unengaged with my conversation
Permission to be on fire when it comes down to no hesitation
I do you and you do me see it's a done deal
Simply for the way I feel all I ask is to come real
So baby won't you give it to me and I'll give it to you
Give it to me and I'll give it to you
No doubt about it, love of the finest, woman
For the ways of class and finesse
Stressed out about the way you got me sprung
For the rest of the rest, nevertheless hooked on intense
Passion, my intuition
Honey coated candy drop, hit'em up much with precision
Take a test drive, my sex drive
To the break of dawn for the fact, let's ride down to the west side
No love for the money grubbing type like 902 on hoes
Hit em up with a two pack of players and straight up gigolos
No second of thought but I'm unengaged with this conversation
Pumming shit up beyond where it comes down to no hesitation
I do you and you do me see it's a done deal
Simply for the way I feel all I ask is to come real
So baby won't you just give it to me and I'll give it to you
Give it to me, and I'll give it to you, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Sweet like sugar but up at the same time
Sour for the pack only attracted to the dollar sign
Between the lines scandalous with the money grubbing
Tell me that ain't something
Somewhat sort of a hooker cause it calls for her love
And never giving up some sort of a dime
PC ain't no teller but the way it goes now in the 90's
So better watch for these games that these tricks play nowadays
Better wake up or wake it up in the morning with AIDS
Give it up for some sort of a way how she could get mine
But the fact that she ain't worth a food stamp at the county line
It was good while it lasted drastic and malicious
What about we call you bitches? (Give it to me and I'll give it to you, ah)
That's right, come on, candy drop (Give it to me and I'll give it to you, ah)
Say what? (Give it, give it to me)
I know you, I see it in your eyes
I see it clearly (give it to me) don't cry
Just real, ill
I'ma get with it real baby
I'ma get with it real
That's 7 Rockers
Give it to me and I'll give it to you (give it to you)
Give it (ah-ah-ah-ah) give it to me
Give it to me and I'll give it to you (ah-ah-ah-ah)
Give it (so, so small)
