To an unknown friend
A hidden code I send
A secret symbol I extend
The reason I cannot pretend
But I will come again
When the autumn leaves descend
And the blackbird bends
Where the labyrinth ends
With a serpent's grin
I know you'll let me in
Where no one's ever been
Into your sweet secret sin
Through a whispered thread
In the dark, unstead
A flicker burns in red
Like a book no one has read
I trace the path unseen
Through the cracks between
Where the echoes lean
And the silent steps between
With a serpent's grin
I know you'll let me in
Where no one's ever been
Into your sweet secret sin
Send me your code and hold me in
To the place where the maze grows thin
Autumn comes and I fall again
With a labyrinth dance
We begin
Sweet secret sin
Sweet secret sin
Sweet secret sin
Where the labyrinth ends, we begin
Through a whispered thread, in the dark unsaid
A flicker burns in red, like a book no one has read
I trace the path unseen, through the cracks between
Where the echoes lean, and the silent steps between
Where the serpents grin, I know you'll let me in
Where no one's ever been, into your sweet secret sins
Sem-ye goreum go me in
To the place where the maze grows thin
Autumn comes and I fall again
Where the labyrinth ends
Sweet secret sin
Where have you been?
Sweet secret sin
The blackbird cries
Sweet secret sin
Where the labyrinth ends, we begin sweet secrets in
Silver key in hand, drawn by fate's demand
In the hush of night, a hot story we write
No witness left, no trace, just a flimsy embrace
In the shadows we spin
Bound by sweet secrets in
Sin, sin
