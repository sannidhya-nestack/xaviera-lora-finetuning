So sick it, so sick it, so sick it, so sick it
Pussycat, pussycat, where have you been?
I've been to London to visit the Queen
Where have you been?
I've been to London to visit the Queen's Queen!
Where have you been?
Been to London to visit the Queen's Queen!
Pussycat's been living with a feast of cats-a-rat (been to London)
Pussycat, Pussycat, where have you been?
Pussycat, Pussycat, where have you seen? (been to London)

You went to New York to find liberty
You went to Rome to explore history
Been Paris and Pella, Taipei and Tokyo, Madrid
Barcelona, Dublin and Toronto
From the North to the South, from the East to the West
24 /7 now we're passing the test
Mixing towns and cities, so many the places
Mixing people and cultures, so many the faces
Sophisticatin' is about bringing back the motion
We can be moving, ocean bending time and emotion
Living truth in devotion
Cause we're living on high riding waves to fly
We be floating on tsunamis of a global motion
Join hands one beat we be flowing 2012 wake up now
Parties growing and growing and growing and growing and growing
On the sunlight from the seeds we are sowing
On the sunlight from the seeds we are sowing
New world's memory, our time has come, see
Rebirth illusory, through music, art and history
Join hands, one beat, one soul complete
Journey across the sea, surrender to the forces that be
Allow your love to help you see
Turn the key, remember the truth that be
We, we are eternity, we are eternal
We, we are eternity, we are eternal
So girl where have you been?
So girl, so girl what have you seen?
I've seen a few things
Pussycat, pussycat, where have you been?
Pussycat, pussycat, what have you seen?
I've been to London to visit the Queen
I've been to London
Where have you been?
I've been to London to visit the Queen
Pussycat, pussycat, where have you been?
Pussycat, pussycat, what have you seen?
The guy's talking to his cat in the hat
A pussycat's been living with a pussycat's a rat
Pussycat where have you been
Pussycat where have you seen him
There's Dr. Seuss's cat in the house
And pussycats been living with the pussycats around
Pussycats are free loving minds
Holding up and true new world designs
And flowing with fresh rivers of desire
Raising people higher in a flash
Not chasing people for cash
But bringing love in a new dawn
The pages, histories of torments
Stories of dawn laden melodies of memories
Of the solar system that lays deep within me
Deeper than the seventh sea
The black hole of eternity burns as the planet turns
And we as humanity yearn for history's saviour
But that ain't gonna save you, it's time to turn
The tables on the fables and intrusions of illusions
Get back to basics so the future faces
Can't wait to make this a catalyst
For our future history to look back upon our time
And smile on the telepathic dial and cosmic telephone
No one's alone in our quest to clean up the mess in our mind
Cause our soul's on fire cause we're chasing feelings of desire
Balancing planetary time
Let your soul shine, let your soul shine
Let your soul shine, let your soul shine
Let your soul shine, let your soul shine
Let your soul shine
She's a cat with a cat, where have you been?
She's a cat with a cat, what have you seen?
As dark as this cat in the hat
She's a cat in a living mess and this cat's a rat
She's a cat with a cat, where have you been?
She's a cat with a cat, what have you seen?
As dark as this cat in the hat
She's a cat in a living mess and this cat's a rat
Pussycat, pussycat, where have you been? (You know we're living on the high of your life)
Been to London to visit (Cat, pussycat, where have you been?)
Pussycat, cat, what have you seen? (Ignite all the souls of vice desires)
(We can rise higher if we're just waking in the plane)
(Relevant existence, we can dance to free our mind and soul)
(And we can roll on the rivers of eternity)
(And we're burning inside as the lemons in the sky ignite what's around us)
Been to London, to Viz, pussycat pussycat where have you been?
Pussycat pussycat what have you seen?
