Coast to coast we ride with the sun in our eyes
you reap so wild, freedom in the skies
City lights so bright, neon signs ignite
Groovin' through the night, rhythm still it right
Livin' that life we choose, no rules, no need for shoes
Lost in the fast lane, dancin' through the rain
Waves of laughter flow everywhere we go
Memories we know will never outgrow
Mountains stand so tall catch us if we fall
Hear the summer call, we're giving it
Living that life we choose
No rules, no need for shoes
Lost in the fast lane dancing through the rain
Coast to coast we ride with the sun in our eyes chasing dreams so wild freedom in the skies
City lights so bright neon signs ignite grooving through the night
Rhythms feeling right living that life we choose
No rules no need for shoes lost in the fast lane dancing through the rain
But put waves to life to flow
Everywhere we go, everywhere we go
Memories we know will never outgrow
Now it's there so tall, catch us if we fall
Hear the summer call, we're giving it
Living that life we choose
No rules, no need for shoes
Lost in the fast lane, dancing through the rain
