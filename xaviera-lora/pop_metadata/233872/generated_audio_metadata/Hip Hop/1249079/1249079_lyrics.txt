Did you ever have a wish for a girl who could inspire
A ten thousand year itch of hell or hot desire
Well let me introduce you please to a girl who fits the bill
I think she took the little red pill
She's a sight to see, miss money
A smile worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She's struts in her high heel shoes
Life's gotten better, she got everything to lose
Fashion's so fly, I have to get an airplane seat
At what cost? I'm still pretty petty
Come and get some, would you like a little treat?
Turning heads everywhere, trust me
There are very, very many
She's a little more than filthy rich
What's her bitch?
Welcome to the sweetness
And this money
Your one sexy sweet money
Is it fame that you adore, miss money?
Now you got little, would you like a little more, miss money?
Sweet little honey, I can see that you are backspickin'
Here to check your mobile, tell me if you got my text
Flexible finessin', I can see that you been messin'
With some things I think you think that you never seen before
She's got a woman that is quite the little fatty
Generous, she is very, very, very catty
Buying up her love is something that she can never seem to get enough of
A swipe of her card, like to play the part
Crashing it very hard in the market for all this money
You're a fantasy, I think about you every day
I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person to a person in your life
Maybe you're a girlfriend, maybe you're a wife
Miss Money, oh she's no dummy
Eyes look up, it's never ever charming with a twinkle of greed in her eye
She's a fiscal fairy, gotta ring by
She's got a stockpile of sweet admirers
They're all just the assets that are fueling her desires
She trades her disses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment that's selling us to market
Her laughter rings like a cash register chime
The love's a currency she can't seem to mine
A portfolio of hearts, oh what a portfolio
But the dividends and loves you'll never really know
Miss Money, oh she's no dummy
Eyes locked up, it's never ever charming
With a twinkle of greed in her eye
She's a disco fairy, wanna ring by
A market of romance she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh how she'll spin to seize
She's a penny pitcher with a golden touch
But the cost of love seems too much for this money
The irony's not lost, can't budget the load, it's an endless cost
Now she's back-fucked in the market of hearts
A fiscal fairy torn apart, but all this money
You're still in sight in the cold, hot, hot in the night
A miss money, oh, she's no dummy
Eyes locked up, it's never ever charming with a twinkle of greed in her eye
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by, so she'll miss the money
Bellow up a ball, may your asses be liquid
Kissing is money, bailing up the ball, may it last, feeling weak
So kissing is money, bailing up the ball, may it last, may I last this, feeling weak
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Miss Money, oh, she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of greed in her eye
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
So here's to Miss Money
The belle of the ball, may her eyes be filled with
But oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Miss Money
Oh, she's no dummy
Eyes love pop
It's never ever charming
With a twinkle of greed in her eye
She's a disco fairy fluttering by
So here's to Miss Money
Round up the ball may your essence be liquid
