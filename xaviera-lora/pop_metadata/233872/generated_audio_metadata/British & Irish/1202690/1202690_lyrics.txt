The Empress of India, such an elegant boat
She was the most gracious cruiser afloat
With her clipper prow and her wardian lines
She stood a symbol of much grander times
But Empress, my Empress, where have you gone?
Just lying otten down in old Shepparton
Every summer from 1910
She guides the length of the River Thames
Carrying women, children and men
On day trips from Richland up to Tharbornend
But Empress, my Empress, where have you gone?
Just lying otten down in old Shepperton
The ladies all wore their pretty frocks
As they sailed the reaches and through the locks
Past ancient churches and cows as they grazed
Waving to picnics on the banks as they laced
Then the river lord changed, you could no longer sail
So they marred you up, left you to fail
Your dicks they walked, your house sprang a plank
No one cared when into the mud you sank
But Empress, my Empress, where have you gone?
Just lying otten down in Old Shepherdstown?
Where have you gone? Where have you gone?
Then came the Conservancy and tore out your heart
They ripped up your wheelhouse and broke you apart
Just threw your pieces into a barge
A century of history lost to the past
But Empress, my Empress, where have you gone?
Just broken and otten down in Old Shepherdstown
Just broken and otten down in Old Shepherdstown
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
