There were three drunken maidens came from the Isle of Wight
They started to drink of a Sunday and never stopped until the Saturday night
And when Saturday night came around me boys all still they wouldn't get out
At ease three drunken maidens they pushed the jugs about
And then in came young Sally with her cheeks as red as the bloom
Move over near me sisters and give young Sally some room
And I will drink your equal before the evening's out
Had these three drunken maidens they pushed the jugs about
They had woodcock, they had pheasant, they had padridge and they had pear
And every sort of delictite me lads was placed up there
Dead forty castor beer me boys and still they wouldn't get out
Had these three drunken maidens they pushed the jugs about
And then in came the landlord, he was looking for his pay
And forty pound bill me boys, these ratbags had to pay
They'd only ten pound a piece me boys, and still they wouldn't get out
These three drunken maidens, they pushed the jugs about
Where are your fancy hats me girls, your mantles rich and fine
They balled these swallowed up me boys, in caskets of fine wine
And where are your fancy men, oh ratbags rich and gay
We left them in the ale
And it's them that'll have to pay
There were three drunken maidens came from the Isle of Hight
They started the drink of a Sunday and never stopped until the Saturday night
And when Saturday night came around me boys, oh still they wouldn't get out
Ah these three drunken maidens they pushed with jokes about
