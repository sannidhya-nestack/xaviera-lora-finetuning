Look, my darling, over there
The waving grass on the hills of Clare
Listen, hear the music swell
At the Bellbridge House Hotel
Summer brings ten thousand feet
To smooth the stones of Milltown streets
Fiddles, flutes and pipers play
Down at Spanish Point today
The music brings the sweetest smile
We've come five thousand miles
Just to dance and play awhile
With the ghost of Willie Clancy
At the cross as we step in
From the sunset half past ten
Soon the session will begin
Set our spirits flying
Chairs are shuffled, pints are set
Old friends gather, newly met
A pretty jig then reels galore
Dawn comes early, we still want more
The music brings the sweetest smile
We've come five thousand miles
Just to dance and play awhile
With the ghost of Willie Clancy
Listen darling can you hear
The sound that rings from the hills of Claire
The music floats out on the sea
Wraps its arms round you and me
If you could have just one wish
Would it be to feel like this
Runs through our fingers just like rain
And hides to find us all again
The music brings the sweetest smile
We have come five thousand miles
Just to dance and play awhile
With the ghost of Willy Clancy
The music brings the sweetest smile
We have come five thousand miles
Just to dance and play awhile
With the ghost of Willy Clancy
With the ghost of Willy Clancy
