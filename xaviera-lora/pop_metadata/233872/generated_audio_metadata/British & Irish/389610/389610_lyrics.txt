Come become a shooting star
White-tailed flasher racing
To the spacey home of rainbows
Rock and rolling
Silver ships like tinsel strewn
Across the stars
Santa Claus is on the moon
Rockets aimed from Mars
Planet Saturn got so good
Spinning rings round tombs
He made the trip in a million years
On a path lit by the moon
Lit by the moon
Lonely winds that never blow
Comet's tail never sways
Aiming for the chenitz children
On Christmas Eve who pray
On Christmas Eve, who prays?
On Christmas Eve, who prays?
