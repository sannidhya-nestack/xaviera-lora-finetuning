It seems like only yesterday I sailed from out a car
I wonder if from Aaron's Isle I landed in New York
There wasn't a soul to greet me there, a stranger on the shore
But Irish luck was with me here and riches came galore
Now I'm going back again to dear old Aaron's Isle
My friends will meet me on the pier and greet me with a smile
Their faces sure I've almost ot they've been so long away
But my mother will introduce them all and this is what she'll say
Take hands with your uncle Mike my boy and here's your sister Kate
And there's the girl who used to swing down by the garden gate
Shake hands with all of the neighbours and kiss the colleagues off
Here's welcome as the flowers and make the dear old money go
They'll give the party when I go home, they'll come from near and far
They'll line the roads for miles and miles with Irish jumping cars
Their spirits will flow and we'll decay, we'll fill their hearts with joy
The piper will play an Irish reel to greet the Yankee boy
We'll dance and sing the whole night long such fun has never seen
The lads will be decked in corner eye the colleen's wearing green
There'll be thousands that I never saw or I've been so long away
And me mother will introduce them all and this is what she'll say
Shake hands with your uncle Mike my boy and here's your sister Kate
And there's the girl you used to swing down by the garden gate
Shake hands with all of the neighbours and kiss the collings off
Here's welcome as the thousand made to dear old Manigault
Shake hands with your uncle Mike my boy and here's your sister Kate
And there's the girl you used to swing down by the garden gate
Shake hands with all of the neighbours and kiss the collings off
Here's welcome as the thousand made to dear old Manigault
