A seed, a host of fleet footmen whose favourite face is one
From farmstead and from fisher's huts along the banks of the Bann
They come with vengeance in their eyes
Too late, too late are they
And young Roddy McCarley goes to die
On the bridge of Doom today
Up the narrow streets he steps
A shining pike in hand
Around the Emperor
'Round his neck the golden ring lit so
There was never a tear in his blue eyes
But strong and bright were they
And young Roddy McCarley he goes to die
On the bridge of doom today
There never was one of all our dead who more bravely fell in fray
The knee who marches to his death on the bridge of doom today
Truth to the last
As we say goodbye, he climbs the upward way
And young Roddy McCarley goes to die on the bridge of doom today
'Twas on a dreary New Year's Eve as the dead of night came down
A lorry load of volunteers approached a border town
There was men from Dublin and from Cork, Fermanagh and Tyrone
And the leader was a limerick man, a shouts out from Gary
A sergeant he's by dare, dare and plan he's by down through the door
With Sten gun and with rifle shots a hail of death they roar
And when that awful night had passed, two men lay cold as stone
The one was from a border town and your man from Garyown
No more he'll hear the seagulls cry or the Mormon shenan-tide
For he fell beneath the northern sky, grave handling by his side
He is gone to join the gallant band
Of Conlon, of Pearce and Town
Another martyr far-off
Ireland, John Snow from Garyown
