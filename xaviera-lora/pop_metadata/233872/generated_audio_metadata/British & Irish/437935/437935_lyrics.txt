Kettle river once again, three years later
In early August we came back for another round
We had no spears but still weren't unarmed
No rods, no tridents but some weapons of another kind
And all the fish down in Kettle River
They were in for a rough sight that day
When two men jumped into the stream but naked
And this time all the fish lived to tell
Worn by our quest in the holy mountains
The coolness of the river granted us much needed rest
Sunny skies and a glass of bubble
The fair ones on the beach call summertime at its best
And all the fish down in Kettle River
They were in for a real treat that day
Two merry men jumped in skinny dipping
And this time none of them became filly
(whistling)
And all the fish down in Kettle River
They were in for a rare sight that day
When two men jumped into the stream but naked
And this time none of them became fillet
And all the fish down in Kettle River
They were in for a real treat that day
Two merry men jumped and skidded it there
And this time all the fish lived to tell
And this time all the fish lived to tell
All fish lived
