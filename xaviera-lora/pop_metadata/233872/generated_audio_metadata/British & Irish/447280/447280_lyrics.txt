A brave and wise old captain came into a rugged town
He had a brand new sailboat, no crew to take her out
But word it got around, of course, about captain and his ship
And soon he had around him men to join him on the trip
It all went very well, at first the wind was in our sails
We trusted our new captain and not once did he fail
But doubts arose among the lads, both captain and his plan
And soon we foolishly decide to take our own command
Take warning folks, he told us, I know this course too well
And if you do not change it, we're going straight to hell
But no one listened, look now where we are
But that you see turned us into a mad and raging horde
And some of us were bastards who kept an overboard
There came a storm that wrecked our ship and we barely survived
We're on a desert island stuck just waiting for it to die
Take warning folks, you told us, I know this course too well
And if you do not change it, we're going straight to hell
But no one listened, look now where we are
Oh Captain R, dear Captain, come save us if you will
With guilt and shame we now face the mess we put us in
For lack of sense we're now paying the price
