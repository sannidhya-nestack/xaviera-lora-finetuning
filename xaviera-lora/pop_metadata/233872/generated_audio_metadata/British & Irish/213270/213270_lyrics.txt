For first steps and learning we set off each morning
To walk the three miles to the bridge of Mayo
Over by Brennan's past lively's and Linden's
With seasonal stops for Blackberry and Slow
Later to Sheeptown with Wellington's turned down
Climbed up Crowhill to the schoolhouse below
Though work on the farm waited for our return
We'd find ourselves running the last half mile home
For it's good to be home
Good to be home
It's good to be home
And so it began for a travelling man
In search of adventure from books that I'd read
Whistled my way over high hills and valleys
Never much caring where I laid my head
Roasted in sunshine and froze in the snow time
Often the rain soaked me through to the bone
But every evening, whatever the season
I'd find a warm someplace that I could call home
For it's good to be home
Good to be home
It's good to be home
And now that the light doesn't shine quite so brightly
I nearly have rambled as much as I need
Daughters and sons setting out on their own way
Wandering footsteps both follow and lead
Over by Brennan's past, Lively's and Linden's
Over Crow Hill, the wide world to roam
In search of adventure, in hope of fulfillment
In hope of someday to be coming back home
For it's good to be home
Good to be home
Good to be home
It's good to be home
