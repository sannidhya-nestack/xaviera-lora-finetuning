There was no warning of the way our love would end
So come the morning light, I will leave to make amends
Through the wind that blows, I will let you know
Where I am
I can never be
What you see in me
I'm all I am
You know I must leave this way
Wherever I look
I'll see your face
The soldiers will come this way
You know I must leave without a trace
Keep running, hiding
Is the way your life will be
Forever riding
If you choose to run with me
Through the rain and snow
We would never know
What would be
They are searching now
They will never set me free
They'll never believe the truth
The hangman is ready with his news
The world is a lonely place
I know I can never win this chase
The love you gave to me
Will always set me free
When my soul is on the wind
You will feel my love again
When you walk amongst the trees
You will hear me on the breeze
I will see you in your dreams
A love that could never be
There was no warning
Of the way our love would end
But come the morning
I will leave to make amends
I will always be what you've seen me
I am what I am
They will never know that my love will grow
Till the end
