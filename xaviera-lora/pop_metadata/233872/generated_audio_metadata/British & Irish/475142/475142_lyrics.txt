I've been a wild rover for many years
I spent all me money on whiskey and beer
But now I'm returning with gold in great store
And I never will play the Wild Rover no more
And it's no nay never
No, nay, never, no more
Will I play the Wild Rover?
No, never, no more
I went to a nail house I used to frequent
And I told the landlady me money was spent
I asked her for credit she answered me nice
Such a customer as you I can have any day
And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never, no more
Will I delay the while over?
No, never
No more
I took up from my pocket
Ten sovereigns bright
And the landlady's eyes
Opened wide with delight
She says I have whiskeys
And the wines of the best
And the words that you told me were only in jest
And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never, no more
Will I play the Wild Rover? No, never, no more
I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
When they've caressed me as oft times before
I never will play the Wild Rover no more
And it's no name, never
No day, never, no more
Will I play the Wild Rover?
No, never, no more
I've been a Wild Rover far many's the year
I spent all me money on whiskey and beer
