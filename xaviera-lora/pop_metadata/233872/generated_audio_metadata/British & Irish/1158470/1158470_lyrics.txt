Overhead and underfoot, the word is out it seems
All the nervousness you felt is banished like a dream
Anywhere you choose to go and anywhere you've been
All your troubles are behind you, full stops in the stream
'Cause this is a happy day
This is a day we will remember
The saddest thing the day will bring
Will be the closing bell
Yes this is a happy day
No time to change your plans
For all the folks who can't be there
There's many more who can
This is a happy day
This is a happy day
People come and people go, time's a fickle friend
Life's a many story thing, it takes you in the end
Hard to say the moment when your losses turn to gain
If life's a railway track that's fine, just don't get off the train
This is a happy day
This is a day we will remember
The saddest thing the day will bring
Will be the closing bell
Yes this is a happy day
No time to change your plans
For all the folks who can't be there
There's many more who can
This is a happy day
This is a happy day
The beating heart, the fevered brow, the troubles you will see
Hand in glove you'll soldier on, some things are meant to be
And all the many lies you'll touch and play for cross day miles
Remember this, this happy day, it's sure to make you smile
'Cause this is a happy day
This is a day we will remember
The saddest thing the day will bring
Will be the closing bell
Yeah, this is a happy day
No time to change your plans
For all the folks who can't be there
There's many more who can
This is a happy day
This is a happy day
