From this valley they say you are going
We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
For they say you'll be taking the sunshine
That has brightened our path for a while
Come and sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
But remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy who loved you so true
From the East Texas plains and the valley
As the time come for you to depart
You return to your home on the Murray
Taking with you this poor cowboy's heart
Come and sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
But remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy who's loved you so true
Now through Marshall and all Grayson County
As the wind in the pan speaks your name
I remember my lost love in the Highlands
And a song from this heart set aflame
Come and sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
But remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy who's loved you so true
