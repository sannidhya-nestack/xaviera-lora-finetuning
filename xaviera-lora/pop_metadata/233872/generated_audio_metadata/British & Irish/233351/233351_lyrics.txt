Let the farmer praise his grounds
Let the huntsman praise his hounds
Let the shepherd praise his dewy scented lamb
Oh, but I'm a-wiser than they
Spend each happy night and day
With my darling little Krushke lawn, lawn, lawn
My darling little Krushke lawn
Oh, grá ma crí ma crúis chín, slánta grá ma vónín
Grá ma crí ma crúis chín lán, lán, lán
Grá ma crí ma crúis chín lán
Immortal and divine
Great Bacchus god of wine
Create me by adoption your own son
In hopes that you'll comply
And my glass will never run dry
Now my darling little Krushke-lon-lon-lon
My darling little Krushke-lon-lon-lon
Ó gráma gríma crúskin slántagáma fóninn
Gráma gríma crúskin lán lán lán
Gráma gríma crúskin lán
Gramma crema cruzkin slanta gamma vonin
Gramma crema cruzkin lon lon lon
Gramma crema cruzkin lon
And when grim death appears in a few but happy years
They'll say, "Oh, won't you come along with me?"
I'll say, "Begone ye, nay, for King Bacchus gave me life
To take another Krushcheel on, on, on
To take another Krushcheel on"
O gram o cream o crushkin shlant o gram o vonin
Gram o cream o crushkin lon lon lon
Gram o cream o crushkin lon
So lift your glasses high, let us not part so dry
Though the lock proclaims it is the dawn
And since we can't remain, may we surely meet again
To share another Khrushcheen lawn, lawn, lawn
To share another Khrushcheen lawn
O gram o gram o kruskin slanta gama vonin
Gram o gram o kruskin lon lon lon
Gram o gram o kruskin lon
O gram o gram o kruskin slanta gama vonin
Gram o gram o kruskin lon lon lon
Gram o gram o kruskin lon
