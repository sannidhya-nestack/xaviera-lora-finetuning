Farewell to your bricks and mortar
Farewell to your dirty lies
Farewell to your gangways and your gangplanks
That the hell with sir overtime
On the good ship Ragamuffin
It'll lie in a decay
For to take your pad with a shovel on his back
To the shores of Botany Bay
I'm on my way down to the quay
Where the ship and anchors lay
To command the gang and navvies
They told me to engage
I thought I'd pop in for a drink
Before I went away
For to take it
On an immigrant ship to the shores of Botany Bay
Farewell to your bricks and mortar
Farewell to your dirty lies
Farewell to your gangways and your gangplanks
And the hell with your overtime
The good shipwreck I'm off on is lying at decay
For they'll take your pet with a shovel and a spout
To the shores of Botany Bay
That boss came up this morning and said, "Well, Pat, you know
If you don't get your nabbies out, I'm afraid you'll have to go"
I asked him for me wages and demanded all me pay
I told him straight that I'd immigrate to the shores of Botany Bay
Farewell to yer bricks and mortar
Farewell to your dirty lies
Farewell to your gangways and your gangplanks
That the hell with your overtime on
The good sugar agamuffin is lying at the gate
For the takeout pad with a shovel in his back
To the shores of Botany Bay
And when I reach Australia, I'll go and dig for gold
There's lots there for the taking, or so I have been told
Or else I'll go back to me trade and a hundred bricks I'll lay
For a lift for an aide and it'll be great on the shores of Watney Bay
Farewell dear bricks and mortar
Farewell to your dirty lies
Farewell to your gangways and your gangplanks
And the hell-bunch are over time
And the good sheep are like a muffin
In a line of decay
For the take-go pad with a shovel on his back
To the showers of Bodney Bay
Farewell to your bricks and mortar
Farewell to your dirty lies
Farewell to your gangways and your gangplanks
And the hell with your overtime
I'm the good sheep ragamuffin
She's a lion at her kay
For to take your pet with his soul on his back
To the shores of potty bay
