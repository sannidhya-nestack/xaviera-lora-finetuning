But now they are moanin' on El Cagrin loanin' the floors
Oh, the forest are all we'd want
At bachts in the morning, nae blithe lads are scornin'
The lassies, they're lainly and dowy and way
Nae daafen, nae gaafen
But saayin and saabin
The floors o' the forest are all weed-walled
O cursed be the order
Sent our lads'tway the border
The English for'irs'twas by guile won the day
The flurs o'er the forest that fought I, foremost, the prime, o'er land now lie cold in the clay.
