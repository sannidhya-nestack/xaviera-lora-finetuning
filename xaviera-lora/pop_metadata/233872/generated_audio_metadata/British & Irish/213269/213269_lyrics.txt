And she turns away from the sunset
Looking for darker skies
She waits for the great awakening
When the night shall open its eyes
And the cold waves crash on warm sand
While tears warm a cold, cold face
Wrapped up in his old MacKinnon cloak
And the memory of his warring ways
And she searches without any guide
Through all of the heavens for thee
Wondering which of those eyes up above
Belong to her love lost at sea
For the call of something strong and sure
Told him to find nature's laws
On a tall ship that catches the wild, wild winds
And he'd navigate by the stars
And she'd see
The way that he was, hold to the light in his eyes
And the last words he spoke before he sailed away
It's a good night for stars
It's a good night for stars
