I wish I had you in Carrick, Fergus
Only four nights in Ballyground
I would swim over the deepest ocean
The deepest ocean
To be by your side
But the sea is wide
And I can't cross over
Neither have I
The wings to fly
I wish I had me
A handy boatman
To ferry me over my love and I
My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy times spent so long ago
My boyhood friends
And my own relations have all passed on now
Like the melting snow
So I'll spend my days in endless roving
Soft is the grass and my bed is free
Oh, to be home
In Carrickfergus on the long road down to the salty sea
And in Kilkenny
It is recorded on marble stones as black as ink
With gold and silver I did support her
And I'll sing no more till I get a drink
And I'm drunk today, but I'm rarely sober
Just a handsome rover from town to town
Oh, but I am sick and my days are numbered
So come all you young men
And lay me down
