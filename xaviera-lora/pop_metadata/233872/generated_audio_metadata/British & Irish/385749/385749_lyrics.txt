Let the grasses grow and the breezes blow
In a free and an easy way
Just give me a sup it a rare old stuff
That's made near Galway Bay
Come growlers all from Donegal
Sligo and Leitrim too
We'll give them the slip and we'll take a trip on a bucket full of Mountain Dew
Skiddley-iddle-iddle-dum-dum, diddley-iddle-dum, skiddley-um-dum, diddley-iddle-day
Skiddley-iddle-iddle-dum-dum, diddley-iddle-dum, skiddley-um-dum, diddley-i-day
Skiddley-iddle-iddle-dum-dum, diddley-iddle-dum, skiddley-um-dum, diddley-i-day
Skiddley-iddle-iddle-dum-dum, diddley-iddle-dum, skiddley-um-dum, diddley-i-day
At the Fortadale there's a neat little still where the smoke hurdles up in the sky
Be a sniff of the smell you can plainly tell there's a butching boy who's close by
Fills the air with a perfume rare and the tricks both me and you
With a twenty dollar hoe a double fisting we will go
With a book or pull a mountain dew
Skiddley idle idle dum dum diddley idle dum skiddley um dum diddley idle day
Dum diddley idle dum dum diddley idle dum skiddley um dum diddley high day
Skiddley idle idle dum dum diddlely idle dum skiddley um dum diddlely idle
Diddle idle idle dum dum diddley idle dum dum diddley idle dum
Skiddley um dum diddley high day
No learned men who used a pen have spoke the praises high
And a sweet pachine from Ireland's green is made from wheat and rye
A way with your pills it'll cure all ills with a Christian pagan or Jew
With a twenty dollar hoe a double fisting we will go with a bucket full of Mountain Dew
Skilly idle idle dom dom diddly idle dom skilly om dom diddly idle day
Dom diddly idle dom dom diddly idle dom skilly dom dom diddly idle day
Skilly idle idle dom dom diddly idle dom skilly om dom diddly idle diddle diddle dom
Dom diddly idle dom dom diddly idol dom skilly om dom diddly idle day
Ah, the grass is growing, the breeze is blowing a free and an easy way
Just give me a supp in the rear, we'll snuff this maid near Galway Bay
Come growlers all from Donegal, Slaygo and Leitrim too
We'll give them the slip and we'll take a sip from the bucket full of Mountain Dew
Skilly idle diddle dum dum diddly idle dum skilly um dum diddly idle day
Dum diddle yodel dum dum diddle yodel dum
Skiddle yom dum diddle yidey
Skiddle yodel diddle dum dum diddle yodel dum
Skiddle yom dum diddle yodel diddle diddle dum
Dum diddle yodel dum dum diddle yodel dum
Skiddle yom dum diddle yidey
Ah, skiddly yodel, yodel, dom, dom, diddly yodel, dom, skiddly yom, dom, diddly yodel, ay!
Ah, diddly yodel, dom, dom, diddly yodel, dom, skiddly yom, dom diddly yoday!
Skiddly yodel, yodel, dom, dom, diddly yodel, day, diddly yom, dom diddly yodel day!
Dom diddly yodel, dom, dom diddly yodel, dom, skiddly yom, dom diddly yoday!
