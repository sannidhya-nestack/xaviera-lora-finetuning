Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountainside
The summer's gone and all the roses fallen
'Tis you,'tis you must go and I must bide
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
I'll be here
In sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so
And if you come when all the flowers are dying
And if I'm dead, as dead I well may be
Then you will come and find where I am lying
And kneel and say, "Anave," there for me
And I shall hear those soft you tread above me
And still my grave will warmer, sweeter be
And you shall bend and tell me that you love me
And I will sleep in peace until you come to me
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
And I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy
Oh Danny boy, I love you so
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so
