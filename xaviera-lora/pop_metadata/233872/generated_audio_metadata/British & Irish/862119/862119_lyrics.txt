Oh dear me, the mill's going fast
The pair we shift ours, can I get their rest?
Shifts and bobbins, coarse and fine
They fairly make you work for your ten and nine
Oh dear me, I wish the day were done
For in an up and down the path is nae fun
Schäften pisan l'spänen warmp weften twain
There's no much pleasure leven affen tennen dein
And it's, oh dear me, the world is ill divided
For them that works the hardest are the least provided
I will work the hard hour, dark days are fine
To feed and clad my bare knees often ten and nine
For it's so dear me
The mill's going fast
The pearly shifters
Can I get their rest?
Shifting barbells
They fairly make you work for your ten and nine
