Bowin', bellin', dancin', drinkin', breakin'
Windows damming, sinking, ever aching
Never thinking, live the rakes of Mallow
Spending faster than it comes
Beating waiters, bailer's sons
Bacchus's true begotten sons
Live the rakes of Mallow
Then to end this raking life they get sober
Take a wife ever after live in strife
And wish again for the raking life of Mallow
One time not but claret drinking, then like politicians thinking
To raise the sinking funds when sinking live the rakes of Mallow
When at home a dad died dying still for a mallow water crying
But where there's good claret lying live the rakes of Mallow
Then to end this raking life, think it's over
Take a wife, ever after live in strife
And wish again for the raking life of Mallow
Living short but merry lives, going where the devil drives
Having sweethearts but no wives, live the rakes of Mallow
Racking tenants, stewards teasing, swiftly spending
Slowly raising, wishing to spend all the days in raking as a mallow
Then to end this raking life, fake it sober
Take a wipe ever after, live in strife
And wish again for the raking life of Mallow
