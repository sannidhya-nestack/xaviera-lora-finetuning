Say rantingly, say wantonly, say dauntingly, gate he
He played the tune and he danced around beneath the gallows tree
It was by a woman's treacherous hand I was condemned to die
Beneath a window on a ledge she stood And a blanket threw over me
Sey ran tindly, sey won tindly, sey done tindly gade he
He played a tune and he danced around beneath the gallows green
Release these bands from off my hands
And give to me a sword
There's nae a man in all Scotland
I'll brave him at a word
Say rantingly, say wantingly, say dauntingly, gade ye
He played a tune and he danced around beneath the gallows tree
Now there's some that come to see me hang And some just top by my fiddle
But before that I would part with her
I'll brack her through the middle
Say ran tin lee, say won tin lee, say don tin lee gate he
He played a tune and he danced around beneath the gallows tree
Say rantin'ly, say wantin'ly, say dauntingly gay dey
He played a tune and he danced around beneath the gallows tree
