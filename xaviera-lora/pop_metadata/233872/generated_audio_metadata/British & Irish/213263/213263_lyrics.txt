I might wander, I might roam
Dublin, Paris, I have been out
A long time I've been gone
But always, Cavan is my home
I've walked the streets of London
Touched under the stars and road
Matter where I go, I'll remember
Cavan is my home
Cavan is my home, yeah
Cavan is my home
Cowshed on the road, an old man on his own
Lonesome night winds moan, yeah, cabin is my home
These things I always say when I lie in my couch alone
No matter where I wander, cabin is my home
Cabin is my home, yeah, cabin is my home
Cabin is my home, yeah, cabin is home
On the lake the herons cry
We drink the souls over grud
In every field and lane, yeah
Cavan is my home
The bitter mouse has grown
And it's time to pay a load
The snorting of pigs in a pen, yeah
Cavan is my home
Cavan is my home, yeah
Cavan is my home
I've wandered the wide world over
Seen the Coliseum and Rome
Danced for Pidome in London
But Carvel's calling me home
Maybe it's just a hunger
Someone leave me alone
I'll bury my heart in Virginia
Cavern sweet, cavern my home, yeah
Cavern is my home, yeah, cavern is my home
Cavern is my home, yeah, cavern is my home
Cavern is my home, yeah, cavern is my home
Cavern is my home, yeah, cavern is my home
