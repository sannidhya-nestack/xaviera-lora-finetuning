Irish lass, mischief in her heart
Lover of nature
Music, books, and art
Woman of courage
In the face of death
Traveling life with passion
Till her dying breath
Oh Irish lass, oh Irish lass
She's at peace now, her battle's done
Her suffering is over with her setting sun
Now the twinkle in her eye is in the starry night sky
And her smile is on the face of the moon
Oh Irish lass
Oh Irish lass
She may be gone from here
But not otten
She's in our hearts now
We think of her often
We hear her whisper through the trees
And feel her touch in the morning breeze
Catch her laughter
Cascading down that tumbling stream
Oh Irish lass, oh Irish lass, oh Irish lass
Raise a glass to this Irish lass
(whistling)
