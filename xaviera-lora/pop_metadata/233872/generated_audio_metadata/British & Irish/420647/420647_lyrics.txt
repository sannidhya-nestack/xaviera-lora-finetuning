(Hey!)
Seth Wigaly on we go
Heel for heel and toe for toe
On and on and on we go
Off for Mari's wedding
Oh the hill weighs up and down
Myrtle green and bracken brown
Pass the shilling through the town
All for the sake of Mari
Step, we get it, on we go
Heel for heel and toe for toe
On and on and on we go
All for Mari's wedding
Plenty here in plenty here
Plenty feet to feel her grill
Plenty body bonds as well
That's the toast for Mari
Step, we get it, on we go
Heel for heel and toe for toe
On and on and on we go
Off for Mari's wedding
Sheets as bright as Romans are
Brighter far than any star
Fairest of them all by far
Is my darling Mari
Said we gave the young we go
Heel for heel and toe for toe
On and on and on we go
All for Mara's wedding
Over hill, ways up and down
Murder green and black and brown
Pass the shilling through the town
All for sake of Mara's wedding
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
(Woo)
(La la la la la)
(Woo woo woo)
(La la la la la)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Step, we get it on, we go
Heel for heel and toe for toe
On and on and on we go
Off on Marley's way
Step, we get it on, we go
Heel for heel and toe for toe
On and on and on we go
Off on Marley's way
S'eth m'gay leon we go
Heel for heel and toe for toe
On and on and on we go
All for Marvin's wedding
S'eth m'gay leon we go
Heel for heel and toe for toe
On and on and on we go
