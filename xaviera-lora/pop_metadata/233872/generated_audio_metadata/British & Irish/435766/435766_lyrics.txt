Our campfire's burning, the night is still young
Together again after such a long time
There's tales to be told and there's songs to be sung
And the occasional mountain to climb
While life is a struggle and most days are grey
And it's hard enough just to get through the day
I'll think of these good times and smile and go on
And know that the future's still bright after all
We'll raise a glass for times that passed and say hooray for friendship
We'll have a pint for days to come may they be filled with laughter
And later on we'll sing new songs and take away all sorrow
We have the greatest time right now so can't wait for tomorrow
We'll raise a glass for times in the past and say hooray for friendship
We'll have a pint for days to come may they be filled with laughter
And later on we'll sing a song to take away all sorrow
We have the greatest time right now still can't wait for tomorrow
Raise a glass for times in the past and say hoorah for friendship
We'll have a pint for days to come may they be filled with laughter
Later on we're singing songs to take away all sorrow
We have the greatest time right now still can't wait for tomorrow
