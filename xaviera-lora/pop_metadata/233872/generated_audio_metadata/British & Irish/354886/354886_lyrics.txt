On the fourth of March, back in nineteen forty-three
For many a sad reminder, a tear-stained memory
As Waterford awoke
To decry the pitiful call
Of the many souls that were lost that night
Beneath the old jail wall
The silence of the night it was broken
By a terrible rumbling sound
Like a bolt from out of heaven
Come crashing to the ground
And the noise rolled on like thunder
As it echoed through the town
And the wall of the old jail gave in to the power
Collapsed and tumbled down
On the night of thunder the candles they flickered and died
There was nowhere to run from the awesome destruction
And nowhere to hide
And the battle was fought for some never won
Like a thief in the night, their last breath of life was taken, stolen away
As the night of thunder turned into a brand new day
For they are gone but not otten
And their memories linger still
Engraved there forever
Upon Pali breaking hills
Under night of thunder the candles flickered and died
And there was nowhere to run from the awesome destruction
Or nowhere to hide
And a battle was fought and many they fought
They never could win
Like a thief in the night
The last breath of life
Was taken, stolen away
The night of thunder turned into a brand new day
Like a thief in the night
The last breath of life
Was taken, stolen away
As the night of thunder turned into a brand new day
