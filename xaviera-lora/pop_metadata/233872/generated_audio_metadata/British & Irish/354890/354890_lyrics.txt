At night inside they sleep in
She wanders through my mind
How'd I go back two years long gone
And love I left behind
I still can't see her gentle smile
No better love I've known
Than to care for your love long years ago
But my heart calls me to roam
She's always been here with me
In the shadows of my mind
Back then I used to tell myself
The pain will ease in time
I tucked it away and faced each day
And no one knew but me
That deep inside my heart still cried
For a love that could not be
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And I still can't find no answer
On a matter of how I try
As to why they may not stay apart
And cause our love to die
But at night I lie light sleeping
Ah that's when the memories start
For time was meant to kill the day
But no one told my heart
Our time was meant to kill the pain of what no one told my heart, no one told my heart
