I tell me ma when I come home
The boys won't leave the girls alone
They pull my hair and steal my comb
But that's alright till I get home
She is handsome she is pretty
She is the belle of Belfast city
She is counting one two three
Please mister tell me who is she
Albert Mooney says he loves her
All the boys are fighting for her
Knock on her door and ring on her bell
And oh my true love are you well
Out she comes as white as snow
Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes
Old Johnny Murray says he will die
If she doesn't get the lad with the roving eye
Let the wind and the rain and the hair blow higher
The love comes humbling from the sky
She's as nice as apple pie
She'll get her own lad by and by
When she gets a lad of her own
She won't tell'em all when she comes home
Let them all say what they will
It's Albert Mooney she loves still
Tell me ma when I come home
The boys won't leave the girls alone
They pull my hair and steal my comb
But that's alright till I get home
She's handsome she's pretty
She's the belle of bellefair city
She's coming one two three
Please mister tell me who is she
