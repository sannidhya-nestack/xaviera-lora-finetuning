Just another day in Eden
Paradise so far away
No one can stop the bleeding
No one around is gonna heal the pain
But yeah, yeah, yeah
I said, ain't that a bitch?
You break a bone'til somebody's itch
I said, ain't that a bitch?
You stop your soul just to feed the itch
I'm all alive'cause better
Not the one that I despise
If I can get myself together
Man, they're gonna send me to fly so high
I said, ain't that a bitch?
You break your bones for somebody's itch
I said, ain't that a bitch?
You starve your soul just to feed the rich
I said, ain't that a bitch?
You break your bones for somebody's itch
I said, ain't that a bitch?
You starve your soul just to feed the rich
Man, they got me working'til I die
Don't wanna do this no more, I'm leaving, goodbye
Get me the hell outta this place
Don't want it no more, don't wanna win this race
Seasons come, reasons go
Why they holding on instead of letting go?
Seasons come, reasons go
Why they holding on instead of letting go?
I said, I ain't that a bitch
You break your bones for somebody's itch
I said, I ain't that a bitch
You stop the soul just to feed the rich
I said, I ain't that a bitch
You break your bones for somebody's itch
I said, I ain't that a bitch
You stop the soul just to feed the rich
Ain't that a bitch
