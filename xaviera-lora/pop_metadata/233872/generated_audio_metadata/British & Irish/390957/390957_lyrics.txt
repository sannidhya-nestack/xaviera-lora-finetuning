As I was walking over the far-flung Kerry Mountains
I met with Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced me pistol and then whipped out me rapier
I said, "Stand and deliver or the devil, he will take you"
Which I ringed him a doodle my dad
Whack for the daddy-o
Whack for the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
I counted out his money
It was a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and
I took it home to Jenny
She swore that she loved me
And never would she leave me
The devil take that woman for ya
No she can't be easy with your ring
Dam-a-do-da-da-da
Whack-a-ball-a-daddy-o
Whack-a-ball-a-daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
I went into her chamber all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of golden jewels and for sure it was no wonder
For Jenny stole me pistols and filled them up with water
Then sent for Captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter
Which a ring never do to my dad
Whack for the daddy-o
Whack for the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
early in the morning
As I awoke to travel
The redcoats stood around me-o
And with them Captain Farrell
I forced produced me pistol
But all I shot was water
The devil take that woman'cause
For sure she is his daughter
With the ring-da-ba-doo-da-da
Whack-a-ball the daddy-o
Whack-a-ball the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
Wait during the mudoodoodah
Whack for the daddy-o
Whack for the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
If I could find me brother
He's a corporal in the army
If I could find his station down in Cork or in Killarney
The two of us we'd go walking
Around the streets of Kilkenny
Where he knows them women better than I know that woman Jenny
Whadja ring dem a do to my dab?
Whack for all the daddy-o
Whack for all the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
Some men like the drinkin'
And some men like the fightin'
Some men find a pleasant woman's company quite inviting
Oh me I just like jillion
All the way down Whitnelly
Where I know she'll treat me better than that awful woman Jenny
Whadja ring dem a do to my dab?
Whack for the daddy-o
Whack for the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
Witchering dum-a-doo-da-ma-da
Whack all the daddy-o
Whack all the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
