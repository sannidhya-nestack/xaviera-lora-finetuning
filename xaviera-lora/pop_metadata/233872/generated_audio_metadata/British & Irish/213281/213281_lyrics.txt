Come vacant, young hearted, come no one
Come show me the truth where it lies
Come heaven, hell or high water
And I'll give you a new pair of eyes
But please don't be too disappointed
If you don't win a prize
I'll buy you a bucket of freedom
And I'll give you a new pair of eyes
If you love me, come love me forever
If you hate me
Leave me alone
I'll buy you a moment that's sweet dear
And I'll give you a dog for the bone
But please don't be too disappointed
If you don't win a prize
I'll buy you a bucket of freedom
And I'll give you a new pair of eyes
But please don't be too disappointed
If you don't win a prize
I'll buy you a bucket of freedom
And I'll give you a new pair of eyes
