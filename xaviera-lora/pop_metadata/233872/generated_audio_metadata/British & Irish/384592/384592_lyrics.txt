I was down the Glen One Easter morn to a city fair rode I
There Ireland's lines of marching men in squadrons passed me by
No pipe did hum and no battle drum
Did sound its dread tattoo
But the Angelus bell over Liffey's swell
Rang out in the foggy, foggy dew
'Twas England bade our wild geese go
That small nations might be free
But their lonely graves are by Sulvis waves
On the fringes of the cold North Sea
But had they died there by Pierce's side
Or fought with Valera true
Their graves would keep where the Finians sleep
the shroud of the foggy, foggy dew
Right proudly high over Dublin town
They hung out a flag of war
be better to die'neath an Irish sky
Than at Sulver or Sud-El-Far
But from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through
While Britannia's Huns with their long range guns sailed in
Through the foggy, foggy blue
But the bravest fell and the requiem bell rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Easter tide in the spring of the year
And the world did gaze with great amaze at those fearless men but few
Who bore the fight so that freedom's light might shine through the boggy, boggy dune
