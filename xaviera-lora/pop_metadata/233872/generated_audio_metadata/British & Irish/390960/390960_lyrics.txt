The places that I travel are far away from home
Invisible ties still haunt me and urge me not to roam
It's back to Bani Kaithnes, the land of my birth
The closest place to heaven
That I have found on earth
Upon the hills of yarrows
Along the road that narrows
Lime slack holds no sorrows
Just wonderful memories
See Granny at the line
Tending to the clothes
The old man's in the kitchen
He's at his milk and bros contented
They both are in their croft upon the hill
The magic and the beauty at the place where time stands still
Upon the hills of Yaros
Along the road that narrows
Lime slack holds no sorrows
Just wonderful memories
(beeping)
