In the mists of the morning
the cobbles of the square
There's a sound of a lonely mandolin
There's a figure, he's walking with his head held high
Can you hear him? It's the coming of Finn
Can you hear him coming? He's playing all the way
Can you hear him coming through the din?
Flags are waving as the village band begin
Can you hear him? It's the coming of Finn
To run in the light
Too raw, live your life
Too raw, live your life
Too raw, live your life
Too raw, live your life
Too raw, live your life
Too raw, live your life
Can you hear him coming? He's playing all the way
Can you hear him coming through the din?
Flags are waving as the village band begin
Can you hear him? It's the coming of Finn
On his brow there's a furrow in remembrance of the war
In his smile all the countries that he's been
In his hands there are memories of the tunes that we bear
Can you hear him? It's the coming of Finn
Can you hear him coming? He's playing all the way
Can you hear him coming through the din?
Flags are waving as the village band begin
Can you hear him? It's the coming of Finn
Can you hear him coming? He's playing all the way
Can you hear him coming through the dune?
Flags are waving as the village band begin
Can you hear him? It's the coming of Finn
Can you hear? (Can you hear?)
Whoa, can you hear? (Can you hear?)
He's coming now
I say, can you hear?
Flags are waving (flags are waving)
As the village band begins (as the village band begins)
Can you hear him?
It's the coming of Finn
It's the common home of Finn
