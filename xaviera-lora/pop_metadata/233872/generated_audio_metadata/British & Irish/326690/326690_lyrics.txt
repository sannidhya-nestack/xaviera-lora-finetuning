I traveled the world over and what did I see
But many sweet women looking back at me
But none did I ask out or they ask of me
For the love of one lady and I love her the most
Ti-ti-ti-tum-ti-tum-ti-tum
Ti-tai-tai-tum-ti-dil-tai-to-dil-tai-tay
I travelled the world over and what did I see?
I saw the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea
But does not compare to what you mean to me
For the love of one lady and I love her the most
Ti-tai-tai-tum-ti-dil-tai-to-dil-tai-tum
Ti-tai-tai-tum-ti-dil-tai-to-dil-tai-tay
I traveled the world over and what did I see
But many sweet women and my short young life
But none did I marry, oh they marry me
For the love of one lady and I love her the most
Ti-tai-tai-tum-ti-l-tai-to-l-tai-tum
Ti-tai-tai-tum-ti-l-tai-to-l-tai-tay
I traveled the world over and what did I see?
The rose that grows near the Sea of Galilee
But does not compare to what you mean to me
For the love of one lady and I love her the most
Ti-tai-tai-tum ti-l-tai-to-l-tai-tum
Ti-tai-tai-tum Ti-l-tai-to-l-Tai-Tay
Ti-tai-tai-tum Ti-l-tai-to-l-Tai-Tum
Ti-tai-tai-tum Ti-l-tai-to-l-Tai-Tay
