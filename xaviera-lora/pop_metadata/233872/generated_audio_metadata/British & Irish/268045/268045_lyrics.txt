The water is wide
I can't cross over
And neither have
I wings to fly
Build me a boat
That can carry two
And both shall row
My love and I
There is a ship
And she sails the sea
She's loaded deep
As deep can be
But not so deep as the love I'm in
I know not how to sink or swim
Oh love is handsome and love is fine
The sweetest flower when first it's new
But love grows old and wax is cold
And fades away like summer dew
Build me a boat, build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row
My love and I
And both shall grow
My love and I
