Last night as I lay dreaming of pleasant days gone by
Me mind been bent on rambling to Ireland I did fly
I stepped on board a vision and I followed
With the will
Till at last I
Came to anchor at
The cross at Spancil Hill
Delighted by the novelty
Enchanted by the scene
Where in me early boy
I thought I heard a murmur and I think I hear it still
It's that little stream of water that flows down around Spansel Hill
To amuse a passing fancy I lay down on the ground
Where boyhood friends and relations did shortly gather round
As we were home returning we danced and sang with goodwill
At the Uwe Morrison's accordion being played round Spanshill Hill
It was on the 23rd of June, the day before the fair
When Ireland's friends and relations and the sons they gather there
The young, the old, the brave and the bold, their duty to fulfill
In that little church of Cluny, a mile from Spansail
Well, I went to see me old neighbours to see what they would say
The old ones were all dead and gone, the young ones torn and grey
I met the Taylor Quigley's, as strange as ever still
Sure he used to sell me bridges when I lived round Spancil Hill
Well I paid a flying visit to me one and only love
She's as fair as ever
And as gentle as a dove, she drew her arms around me, saying, "Johnny, I love you still"
Oh, she's now the farmer's daughter and the bride of Spencerville
While I dream she hugged and kissed me like in the days of yore
Saying Johnny you're only joking like many's the time before
The cock crew in the morning he grew both loud and shrill
I awoke in California
Many miles from Spantle Hill
I awoke in California
Many miles from Spantle Hill
