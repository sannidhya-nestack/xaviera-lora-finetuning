A holiday, a holiday, and the first one of the year
Lord Donald's wife came into the church, the gospel for to hear
And when the meeting it was done, she cast her eyes about
There she saw little Mattie Groves walking through the crowd
Come home with me little Mattie Groves, come home with me tonight
Come home with me little Mattie Groves, sleep with me'til light
Oh, I can't come home, I won't come home and sleep with you tonight
By the rings on your fingers I can tell you are Lord Donnel's wife
But if I am Lord Donald's wife, Lord Donald's not at home
He is out in the far cornfield bringing the yearlings home
And a servant who was standing by and hearing what was said
He swore Lord Donald he would know before the sun would set
And in his hurry to carry the news he rent his breast and ran
When he came to the Broadmouth stream he took off his shoes and swam
Little Matty Groves, he lay down and he took a little sleep
When he awoke Lord Donald was standing at his feet
Saying, "How do you like my feather bed?
How do you like my sheets?
And how do you like my lady fair who lies in your arms asleep?"
Oh, it's well I like your feather bed
And well I like your sheets
But it's better I like your lady gay
Who lies in my arms asleep
Well, get up, get up, Lord Donald cried
Get up as quick as you can
It'll never be sad in this fair land
That I slew a naked man
Oh I can't get up, I won't get up, I can't get up from my life
For you have two long beaten swords, and I but a pocket knife
Well it's true I have two beaten swords, and they cost me deep in the purse
But you will have the better of them, and I will have the worse
And you will strike the very first blow, and strike it like a man
I will strike the very next blow, and I'll kill you if I can
So Matty struck the very first blow and he hurt Lord Donald's sore
Lord Donald struck the very next blow then Matty struck no more
And then Lord Donald he took his wife and he sat her on his knee
Saying who do you like the best of us? Matty, Groves or me?
And then up spoke his own dear wife, never heard to speak so free
I'd rather a kiss from dead Maddy's lips than you or your finery
Lord Donnel, he jumped up, his broad sword he did draw
He struck his wife right through the heart and pinned her against the wall
A grave, a grave, Lord Donald cried to put these lovers in
But bury my lady at the top, for she was of noble kin
Ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
