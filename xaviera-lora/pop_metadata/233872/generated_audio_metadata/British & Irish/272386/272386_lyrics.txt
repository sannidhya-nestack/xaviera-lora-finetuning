Beauty may seem a worthy prize
But often wears a thin disguise
A jealous heart and evil fear
Transform the children of good King Lear
Fyr na leith, fyr krakon
Nine hundred years your fate is swans
No voice or harp can music bring
To match the plaintive song you sing
A widowed king's desire led
Him to an envious beauty wed
Her grace a darkened heart concealed
Her curse did her true self reveal
His precious children left in her care
To do the countryside repair
Down to the lake for sport and game
Her curse she placed, swans they became
Fear no life, fear Quir'qan
Nine hundred years, your fate is swans
No voice or harp can music bring
To match the plaintiff's song you sing
And oh, forlornly did they cry
Across the lake, circling the skies
Their father, hearing of their fate
Rushed madly, sadly, to the lake
Oh good King Lur, a tragic pain
Within your heart now must remain
No charm have you to end the spell
No words your depth of grief can tell
Fionnula e Fíocracan
Nine hundred years your fate is swans
No voice or harp can music bring
To match the plaintive song you sing
Fionnula e Fíocracan
Nine hundred years, your faintest swans
No voice or harp can music bring
To match the plaintive song you sing
