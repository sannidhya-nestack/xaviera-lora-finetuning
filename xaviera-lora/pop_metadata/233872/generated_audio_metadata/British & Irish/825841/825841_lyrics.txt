Black is the color of my true love's hair
His lips are like some roses' fair
He has the sweetest smile in the gentlest hands
And I love the ground
Where on he stands
I love my love and well he knows
I love the ground where on he goes
I wish that day would soon come
When he and I can be as one
Can be as one
Can be as one
Can be as one
As one
I go to blacklight and I mourn and weep
But satisfied, I never sleep
Just a few short nights
Dust affected
Ten thousand times
Black is the color
Of my true love's hair
His lips are like some roses' fair
He's got the sweetest smile
In the gentlest hands
And up the ground where on his toes
High up the ground, we're all lost here
