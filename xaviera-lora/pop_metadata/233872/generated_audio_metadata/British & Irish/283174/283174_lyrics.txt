It was his nineteenth August
Blind fire burning in his soul
She was a woman of twenty-one
Flashing eyes as black as coal
And she had been to London
And learned the fashions there
And she wore summer roses
Summer roses in her hair
And he was like a sailor drunk with their perfume
He fought his pounding heart as she showed him to her room
And he would long remember
The pleasures they found there
Among the summer roses
Summer roses from her hair
Surely as the warm days ebb
And the mist flows from the sea
She soon was swept away by a grown man of twenty-three
It broke his heart completely
That fair weather love affair
It died before the roses
Summer roses in her hair
So guard your heart
From the blooming flower
And of its thorns beware
Be sure it's love you love
And not just roses
Summer roses in her hair
