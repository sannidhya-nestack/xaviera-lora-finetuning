As I was a-goin' o'er the Cork and Kerry mountains
I spied Captain Farrell and his money he was countin'
I soon produced me pistol and then produced me rapier
Sayin', "Stand and deliver for you are a bold deceiver"
Rush a-ring-a-mada-rum-da
Whack fo' the dairy, oh
Whack fo' the dairy, oh
There's whiskey in the jar
He counted out his money
And it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket
Took it home to darling Jenny
She sighed and swore she loved me
That she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women
For they never can be easy
Rush a ring-a-ma-da-rum-da
Whack for all the dairy, oh
Whack for all the dairy, oh
There's whiskey in the jar
I went into me chamber of four to take a slumber
There'd a dream of golden jewels and for sure it was no wonder
Me Jenny took me charges and she filled them up with water
And called on Captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter
Russia ringa ma drum da
Whack fo' the dairy ho, whack fo' the dairy ho
There's whiskey in the jar
Next morning, bright and early, just before I rose for travel
Up came a band of footmen and likewise Captain Farrell
I soon produced me pistol, for she'd stole away me rapier
But a prisoner I was taken,'cause I couldn't shoot the water
Rushed a ring on my durum dah
Whack fo' the dairy, oh, whack fo' the dairy, oh, there's whiskey in the jar
Oh, some might take delight in the carriages a-rolling
And some may take delight in the hurling and the bowling
But me, I take delight in the juice of the barley
And courting pretty fair maids in the morning
Oh, so early, rush a-ring-a-ma-da-rum-da
Whack fo' the dairy, oh
Whack fo' the dairy, oh
There's whiskey in the jar
If anyone could save me, it's my brother in the army
If I might know his station, whether Cork or in Killarney
Well together we'd go rovin' all around Kilkenny
And I swear he'd treat me better than me darlin' Spartan Jenny
Russia ring-a-ma-da-rum-da
Wack fold the Dario
Wack fold the Dario
There's whiskey in the jar
Rush a ring-a-ma-da-rum-da
Wack fold the Dario
Wack fold the Dario
There's whiskey in the jar
