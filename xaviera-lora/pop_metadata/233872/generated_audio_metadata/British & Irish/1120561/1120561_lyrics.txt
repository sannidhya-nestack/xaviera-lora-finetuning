I've been a Wild Rover for many's the year
And I spent all my money on whiskey and beer
And now I'm returning with golden great store
And I swear I will play the Wild Rover no more
And it's no, nay, never
No never no more
Will I play the Wild Rover
No never no more
I went to an alehouse I used to frequent
And I told the landlady my money was spent
I asked her for credit, and she answered me, "Nay"
Such custom as yours I can get any day
And it's no nay never
No nay never no more
Well I play the Wild Rover
No never no more
I reached in my pockets for a handful of gold
And on the round table it glittered and rolled
I called then for whiskey and beer of the best
But I told you before it was only ingest and it's no, nay, never
No name never, no more
Will I play the Wild Rover
No never, no more
I'll return to my parents, confess what I've done
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
And when they ive me as oft times before
I swear I won't play the Wild Rover no more
And it's now, nay, never
No, nay, never, no more
Will I play the Wild Rover?
No, never, no more
And this, no, nay, never
No name, never, no more
Will I play the Wild Rover?
No, never, no more
Will I play the Wild Rover?
No, never, no more
