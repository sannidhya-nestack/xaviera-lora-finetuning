Kilkarny and Kilkenny and Dublin on to Cove
Cliffs of Moor and County Cork
Let's kiss the Blarney Stone
Orange, white and green
Fields of ethereal heat
Raise your glasses, lads and lassies
It's higher than to me
Ring of Kerry, Waterford and Limerick or Clare
Shannon needs to go away where we'll sing an Irish air
Orange, white and green
Fields of athenry
Raise your glasses, lads and lassies
It's Ireland to me
Guinness mixed with Jamieson
Murphys and some Killians
Four leaf clovers, baited rovers
Sheep running wild and free
Orange, white and green
Fields of ethinry
Raise your glasses, lads and lassies, it's higher than two-e
Bagpipes play in amazing grace at Patrick's own parade
Football and some rugby down in Pines at the end of the day
Orange, white and green
Fields of ethereal heat
Raise your glasses, lads and lassies
It's higher than to be
