Listen to the radio, see it on the TV
Headlines in the morning paper, the clock of history repeats
They say we gotta make a stand, shoot'em'til they drop
Lay a little freedom there
Like it or not
If I told you once
Must have told you twice
The last thing you're looking for is their advice
You'll plead their case and make nice, nice
But the last thing you're looking for is their advice
For the safety of our homeland
Think we've been through this before
Sent our kids to die in Vietnam
To keep the commies from our door
Now they tell us there's a way to live
Mixed messages are clear
Spend your bread but watch your back
Oh, live your life in fear
If I told you once, must have told you twice
The last thing you're looking for is their advice
Truth they told is just a pack of lies
The last thing you're looking for is their advice
The towers fell, another easy sell
We let them lead us down the road to hell, ooh
If I told you once, must have told you twice
The last thing you're looking for is their advice
They'll plead their case and make it nice, nice
But the last thing you're looking for
If I told you once, must have told you twice
The last thing you're looking for is their advice
They'll plead their case and make it
Nice, nice, but the last thing you're looking for
If I told you once, must've told you twice
The last thing you're looking for
