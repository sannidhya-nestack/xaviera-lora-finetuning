Some wore blue, some wore grey
Some were free, some were slaves
They fought for home and way of life
Some were wrong, some were right
But they were brothers in arms, one and all
Marching into battle just the same
Fighting with valor, stand or fall
To meet their fate and share the pain
Some wore blue
Some wore blue
Some wore grey
They call to you
From their grave
They sacrificed as they believed
And gave all gallantly
And they were brothers in arms one and all
Marching into battle just the same
Fighting with valor, stand or fall
To meet their fate and share the pain
And some wore grey
Though we celebrate those who win a war
All shed their blood and tears come what may
Recognize the heroes they are
United in one nation today
Here to stay
Oh some wore blue
And some wore grey
Yeah some wore blue
And some wore grey
