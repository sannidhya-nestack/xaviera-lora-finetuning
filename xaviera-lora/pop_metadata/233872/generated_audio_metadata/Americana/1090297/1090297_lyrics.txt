Gazing out the window
Listening to the thunder
Watching beads of rain
Roll down the window pane
I realize as lightning fills the sky
I was crazy to ever let you go
All those nights I told you
I was being faithful
I was running round with girls all over town
I realized as I recalled my lies
I was crazy to ever let you go
If I'd been in my right mind
I'd have known what I had
A woman who loved me with all of my faults
A woman who loved me as I am
Storm clouds finally moved on
But I don't see a rainbow
After all these years
Your memory's still so clear
I realize
As tears fall from my eyes
I was crazy to ever let you go
If I'd been in my right mind
I'd have known what I had
A woman who loved me with all of my faults
A woman who loved me as I am
Gazing out the window
Listening to the thunder
Watching beads of rain roll down the window pane
I realize as lightning fills the sky
I was crazy to ever let you go
Oh I know
I was crazy to ever let you go
