I still look at the sky
Through your clear blue eyes sometimes
So perfect how they seem to hold the light
Like a Venus sun arising
Through the middle of the night
You had a special way of shining with the light
One day while we were walking
Eyes watching you start your lying
Though I hated all that lying
I just had to share that light
And share we did
Although I knew the night would come sometime
Somehow you had the magic and still you do today
But you weave it now with others light like you
And I sit here in the darkness and I play my same old song
Singing how I once had shone in the light of you
But I still look at the sky through your clear blue eyes sometimes
I can still sing to the world through your voice
So beautiful and liquid how they seem to hold the light
Still looking on the bright side of a choice
