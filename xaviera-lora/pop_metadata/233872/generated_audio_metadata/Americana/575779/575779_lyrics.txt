The sun don't always shine in this life of mine
It's no use complaining when it keeps raining
And the blues keep on hanging around
I know when Saturday comes
I'll get those blues on the run
When the week's work is done
It's time to have fun
Waltzing the blues away
Waltzing the blues away
I'm waltzing the blues away
It's a waltz with a bottle and a waltz to the bar
I'm waltzing the blues away
I've never felt so alone since my good girl was gone
She turned off the light and said good night
And I won't see her anymore
Whiskey won't hide memories
Not sweet memories like these
So when I feel down I hit the town
And go waltzing the blues away
Waltzing the blues away
Waltzing the blues away
It's a waltz with a bottle and a waltz to the bar
Waltzing the blues away
It's just a waltz with a bottle and a walk to the bar
We'll sing the blues away, mm-hmm
