This small town couldn't hold my big dreams
The distant lights beyond the river shone brighter than home
At eighteen I rode my dreams on the first wind out of town
They'd all come true somewhere down the road
Down the road I'll ride faster horses
Climb higher mountains and run through greener fields
Like an eagle on the wind, I'll fly over the rainbow
Somewhere down the road
With every step, my world kept getting smaller
Found my dreams were never further than my front yard away
Looking back from where I'm at I've got a different point of view
Now the lights of home are showing me the way
Down the road I'll ride faster horses
Climb higher mountains and run through greener fields
Tonight I'll sleep in my old bed at the end of the rainbow
Somewhere down the road
Down the road
Down the road
Like an eagle on the wind, I'll fly over the rainbow
Somewhere down the road, down the road
