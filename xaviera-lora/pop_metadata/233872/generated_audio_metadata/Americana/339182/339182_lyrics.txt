A sad, sad man found a lot of money
More money than he had ever seen
But the money slipped through his fingers just like honey
And the honey couldn't stop his leaky dreams
Well who said that life was logical
Well I'm not so good at this at all
And who said that life was practical
Logical
A beautiful lady passed through the night
But her beauty was missed beneath the old street light
And her cheap dress didn't go unnoticed
On the bedroom floor early in the morning
And who said that life was logical?
Well I'm not so good at this at all
And who said that life was practical?
Logical
The morning forecast called for wind
More wind than you had ever seen
But the storms in this town are not so friendly
That the dirty streets were swept clean
And who said that life was logical?
Well I'm not so good at this at all
And who said that life was practical?
Logical
And who said that life was logical?
I'm not so good at this at all
Who said that life was practical or logical?
