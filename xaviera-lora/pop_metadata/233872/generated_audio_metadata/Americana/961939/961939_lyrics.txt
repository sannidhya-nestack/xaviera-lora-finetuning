Yeah, the pubber can't find my way home
But Papa can't find my way home
And I found out I got a long, long way to go
But today, Hugo had him cried
But today, Hugo had him cried
Say hello to Marseille on that wicked child way
And when the time of coming and the snow is gonna fall
When the time of coming and the snow is gonna fall
There ain't a woman touch some of my time in this soul
Yeah, I've a papa, my boneheads are all wild
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've a papa, my boneheads are all wild
I've a papa, can't find my way home
(Outro)
