It takes a hot and sweaty night
To grease up the dance floor
It's all the girls eager for love
That brings you back for more
And there's no end to this life
Created in song
And there's no end to the tour
That goes on and on
When the last song's been played
And the crowd calls out for more
There's a sigh that fills the air
And you know he's been there
He fell one night and there was no cure
His anguish quenched his soul and the sound was so very pure
Now the crowd heads for the door
For tonight there'll be no more
His life was filled with the music
Spilling out on the floor
And when the last note's been played
And the crowd calls out for more
There's a sigh that fills the air
And you know
He's been there
