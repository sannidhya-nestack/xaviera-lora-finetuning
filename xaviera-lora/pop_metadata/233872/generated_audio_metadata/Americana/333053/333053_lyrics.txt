Well today I'm gonna do exactly what I wanna do
I can't please everybody
I can't please everybody
I'm tired of compromising, no offense to you
I can't please everybody
I can't please everybody
The road keeps rolling and the time goes faster
I gotta take a step back and remember who I wanted to be
Every time I try to live a lie I wind up with a bigger disaster
I have to stop and ask myself if I'm being me
You don't have the power to hold me down
You can't set me free
I'm not living for you, I'm living for me
I won't tell you how to live
Don't bother telling me
I can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
Don't expect me to convey you that authority
I can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
The road keeps rolling and the time goes faster
I gotta take a step back and remember who I wanted to be
Every time I try to live a lie I wind up with a bigger disaster
I have to stop and ask myself if I'm being me
You don't have the power to hold me down
You can't set me free
I'm not living for you, I'm living for me
And if you wanna come along and ride with me
We'll have a good time and I'd like the company
But I'll be sitting in the driver's seat
The road keeps rolling and the time goes faster
I gotta take a step back and remember who I wanted to be
Every time I try to live a lie I wind up with a bigger disaster
I have to stop and ask myself if I'm being me
You don't have the power to hold me down
You can't set me free
I'm not living for you, I'm living for me
No, I'm not living for you, I'm living for me
I'm not living for you, I'm living for me
