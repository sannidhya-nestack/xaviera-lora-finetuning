How many lives have passed between us
I can't count the broken hearts and dreams
Your fading love's before my eyes
Why is mercy yours now running blind
We would walk along the river
We would talk like kids of school
I watched you graduate in
Who taught the girl to be so cruel
Mercy yours, mercy mine (mercy mine)
That once will never happen twice
I can't recall no sweeter time (mercy mine)
Mercy yours, mercy mine
You know that I can't talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it
I can't read about it
I don't wanna joke about it
I don't wanna think about it
I don't wanna laugh about it or cry about it
How about you?
I don't read them morning papers
No, I prefer to hear my lies
I can watch your lips still moving (mercy mine)
But I now rely on older signs
This night's so gray and faded (mercy mine)
My lust for love is more than jaded
I can't even recollect a time
Mercy
When I had some faith and I hoped to make it
Mercy yours, mercy mine (mercy mine)
That once would never happen twice
I can't recall no sweeter time (mercy mine)
Mercy yours, mercy mine
Crashing through the kitchen dishes (mercy mine)
Burning all my fondest wishes
Can you recollect a sweeter time (mercy mine)
When mercy yours was mercy mine
You held me once or twice again (mercy mine)
Now you tell me just as true as then
Can you recollect a sweeter time (mercy mine)
When mercy yours was mercy mine
It was so fine
