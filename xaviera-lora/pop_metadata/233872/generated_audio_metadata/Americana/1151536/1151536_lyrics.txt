'Til the tale of tides did rise
The levee sinks before our eyes
What's gone is gone, what's high is dry
Sit out on the street, watch the children cry
I got to keep their memory
From fading into the passing sea
So I tell the tale
Why not tell the tale again a thousand times
Streets dissolving into mud
Lies that fly out the dusty skies
What has been done today is done
You know no one ever heard your cry
I tell the tale of children crying
Tell the tale
This ain't no soft wind brushing no summer's time
I know, tell the tale
I watch the government just look away
Had nothing ventured and nothing to gain
Why are the poorest always made to pay
The highest price for some other charade
These stories left untold will fade
Right into their streets like another parade
Why not till the day? (till the day)
Why not till the day? (why not till the day?)
Yeah, why not till the day? (till the day)
Why not till the day? (why not till the day?)
