I'll be your backbone baby
I'll be your sure thing
I'll be your superstar
You can rely on me
I'm like the sun shining
Even there behind the clouds
I'm here to pick you up
Even when you don't fall down
All your worry can melt away now
All your worry can melt away
All your worry can melt away now
All your worry can melt away
I'm right here
I'll be your jawbone, baby
I'll be your cornerstone
I'll be your cheering crowd
When you're feeling all alone
Keep shining out your bright light
Really bold and dazzling
Rest easy and know for certain
No matter what, you got me
All your worry can melt away now
All your worry can melt away
All your worry can melt away now
All your worry can melt away
I'm right here
Now rest and save your strength
You sure have been through hell
I wish that I could tell you
How proud I am of you right now
You're strong like your mama
Smart and bold and oh so brave
Can my angel have an angel
To guard her anyway
All your worry can melt away now
All your worry can melt away
All your worry can melt away now
All your worry can melt away
All your worry can melt away now
All your worry can melt away
All your worry can melt away now
All your worry can melt away
I'm right here
