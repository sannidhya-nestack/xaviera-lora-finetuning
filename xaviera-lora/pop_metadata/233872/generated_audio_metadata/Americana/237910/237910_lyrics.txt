Raise your purple finger
Come on and raise your purple finger
From the land of the free and the home of the brave
Hold on folks cause freedom's on its way
Purple finger
Yeah raise a purple finger
They took a stand for freedom and sweet liberty
Raised their ink-stained fingers for the world to see
Purple finger
Yeah, they raised their purple fingers
It's the right to vote and the freedom of speech
So hold your head high walking down the street
Purple finger
Come on and raise your purple finger
Earn it!
Yeah!
Purple mixed from the red, white and blue
It's the land of the free for all who choose
Purple fingers, oh yeah purple fingers
Raise the victory sign so no doubt still lingers
We've all come together just to raise in purple fingers
Brothers and sisters raising purple fingers
