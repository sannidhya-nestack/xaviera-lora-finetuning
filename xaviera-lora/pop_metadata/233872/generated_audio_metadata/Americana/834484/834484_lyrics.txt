You wonder why I smile when all I feel is pain
You wonder why I laugh
When all it does is rain down on me
Down on me
And I say life is beautiful
Life is beautiful
Life is beautiful to me
I played my songs for money
I played my songs for free
Truth be told about it
It never mattered much to me
Either way, yeah
Either way, yeah
'Cause life is beautiful, life is beautiful, life is beautiful
And I just wanna play
Sky is getting dark, it's getting hard to see
But the moon is shining for, shining down on you and me
And I say, yeah
And I say, yeah
Life is beautiful
Life is beautiful, life is beautiful today
