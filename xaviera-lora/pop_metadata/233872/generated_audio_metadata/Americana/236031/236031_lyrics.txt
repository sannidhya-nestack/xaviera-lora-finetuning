Mother and child, sons of men
Refugees from different lands
Open your heart,'cause she's calling you
Here's to the lady that's standing tall
Out in the harbor she takes her stance majestically
She reaches high to shine her light to welcome more
Open your heart'cause she's calling you
The time has come to weld her steel
Mend her eyes, light her torch
Keep her standing strong
Let your voices sing and shout
Sing to her and cheer her great aloud
Here's to you, Miss Liberty
May you always hold your head up high
Here's to you Miss Liberty
May the light of freedom forever shine
Here's to you Miss Liberty
God bless you and keep you strong
May the light of justice shine on everyone
Mother and child, sons of men
Refugees from different lands
All in the pursuit of liberty
All who believe in the American dream
Let's keep her safe, protect her home
Restore her heart, keep her strong
Give her love, keep her standing proud
Can't you hear her calling you?
Lift your voices and sing to her aloud
Here's to you, Miss Liberty
May you always hold your head up high
Here's to you, Miss Liberty
May the light of freedom forever shine
Here's to you, Miss Liberty
Fathers and daughters and sons and sons
Lift your voices and sing out one
Here's to you, Miss Liberty
May you always hold your head up high
Here's to you, Miss Liberty
May the light of freedom forever shine
Here's to you, Miss Liberty
Lift your voices and sing aloud
Keep her strong and keep her standing proud
