You may not know who I am
One of the men who fought for this country
Even though my heart tells me that war is wrong
When duty calls I'm ready to stand strong
I know you don't understand
You weren't there fighting right by my side
Those five inch guns still echo in my mind
Like the bell that tolls for my shipmates left behind
Where's the glory they deserve?
Where's the honor that they've earned
Where's the dignity when young heroes die
Where's the glory in the star-spangled sky
It was the third of June in'69
The moon was bright and the sea was calm
The heavens had a crash and she went down fast
For seventy-four souls this day would be their last
Where's the glory they deserve?
Where's the honor that they've earned?
Where's the dignity when seventy-four heroes die?
Where's the glory in the star-spangled sky?
When you go to Vietnam in fall
Your name should be up on the wall
For seventy-four men in sixty-nine who died
Their rightful place is still being denied
Where's the glory they deserve?
Where's the honor that they've earned?
Where's the dignity when young heroes die?
Where's the glory in the star-spangled sky?
Where's the glory? Where's the glory?
Where's the glory in the star-spangled sky?
Where's the glory?
Where's the glory?
Where's the glory in the star-spangled sky?
