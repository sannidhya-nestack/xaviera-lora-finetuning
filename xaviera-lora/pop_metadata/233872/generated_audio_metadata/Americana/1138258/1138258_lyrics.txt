Thieving boy, I was a thieving boy
All my life I was a thieving boy
Thieving boy, I was a thieving boy
All my life I was a thieving boy
Ain't no life, ain't no joy for a thieving boy
Ain't no joy, ain't no life for a thieving boy
Ain't no joy in the life of a thieving boy
Thieving boy went to jail
Judge said son now there ain't no bail for a thieving boy
Thieving boy went to jail
Judge said son now there ain't no bail for a thieving boy
Sent to jail ain't no bail for a thieving boy
Sent to jail ain't no bail for a thieving boy
Ain't no joy in the life of a thieving boy
Learn to sleep on a cold hard floor
Rats and mice running through my door
Learn to sleep on a cold hard floor
Rats and mice running through my door
Ain't no sleep on a cold hot floor for a thieving boy
Ain't no sleep on a cold hot floor for thieving boy
Ain't no joy in the life of a thieving boy
Thieving boy met a thieving gal
Got married, went robbing, right back to jail
Judge said you look like you're doing so fine
But this time, boy, you got a nine and nine
Thieving boy
You're never gonna see blue sky again, Stephen Boyd
Never gonna walk out free no more, Stephen Boyd
