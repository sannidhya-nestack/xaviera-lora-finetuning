There's darkness in the deepest ocean
Out from the stars above
Not as much as the light that shone
From a gold-colored land of growth
There's bitterness when the winter freezes
And there's warmth from the big red sun
Not as much as the warmth I felt
From a torch of anachrome
She was a good friend to me
She would come and go
One day she disappeared like the pure
Oh, I drift in the snow, where she go?
I had a dream
It was on one cold grey dawn
I walked and looked around me
Never saw her face no more
And there's beauty in colour
In a world of rain and sun
I ain't seen the beauty since Anna Grove been gone
She was a good friend to me
She would come and go
One day she disappeared
Like the pure white drifting snow
