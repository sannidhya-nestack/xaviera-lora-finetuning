She put the pencil down
She opened up her book
I could feel the pressure closing in
She gave me such a look
Saw the cloud fly by her eyes
The shadow across her face
She could either tell me or die right in her place
It seems her time had come and gone so fast
Like I was standing still
Well she fed Van Gogh's white horses
By his grave upon the hill
She kissed me on the church steps
By Rémy Auvers
They say that pictures cannot lie
I said now come again
Their heart was crumbled papers
That were flying over the fair
Her eyes go blue like the autumn sky with tears of raining wind
Her voice a shout of languages I will never understand
I watch the fingers play my guitar like a frailing piece of tin
She said to me she'd try to be exactly what I wanted
Happiness denied, but her heart's come slightly haunted
She must've loved the storm, her blue eyes loved to cry
She must've ripped herself wide open like the autumn sky
Like the autumn sky
She must have loved me once
She must have loved me twice
We must have been so happy
In that freakish paradise
She never said one single word
That did not crush my heart
We never sang a sweeter
Than the day we had our birth
She called me on the phone
No need in innocence
I'd listen up anyway because the force was so intense
She would not make no sense at all
I couldn't follow this all back
I told her why'd you use this sentence
A period for that
She said to me she'd try to be exactly what I wanted
There'd be no denying that our house came slightly haunted
Our house came slightly haunted
Come slowly, heartache
