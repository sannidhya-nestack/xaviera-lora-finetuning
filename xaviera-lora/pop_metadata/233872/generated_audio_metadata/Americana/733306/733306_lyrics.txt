Won't you hold the ladder while I try to reach the sky
Although I don't suppose it matters if I never get that high
I just want a good friend behind in case I fall
So won't you hold on to the ladder while I try that song
Well you know there was a time when I'd have tried to do this all by myself
But I took one too many tumbles and tumbling ain't so good for your health
Boy you know I'd do the same for you if you asked me to when all is said and done
it's good to have somebody you can trust standing on the bottom rope
So won't you hold the ladder
While I try to reach the sky
Although I don't suppose it matters
If I never get that high
I just want a good friend
Behind in case I fall
So won't you hold on to the ladder while I try
That's all
Now you know that I'll get vertigo if I look below and you've let go at the end
Oh when I come down from a ladder I wanna know that I was let down by a friend
So won't you hold the ladder
While I try to reach the sky
Although I don't suppose it matters
If I never get that high
But I just want a good friend
Behind in case I fall
So won't you hold on to the ladder while I try
Won't you hold on to the ladder while I try
Won't you hold on to the ladder while I try
That's all, that's all, that's all
