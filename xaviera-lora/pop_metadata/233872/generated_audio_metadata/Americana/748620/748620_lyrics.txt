Here come the blues, baby like bad news
One invitation that we can't refuse
I heard from a bird this marker's due
I look around, baby all I see
Is desperation and misery
At least I've got you for company
If we head out in a different town
You know they'll only hunt us down
We can change our names and flee
But they're gonna get us eventually
Here come the blues
Here come the blues, here come the blues, here come the blues
And the word is there after me and you
Bad luck and trouble are closest friends
Even the devil wants to make amends
Ever since the fruit fell off of the tree
That snake's been after you and me
Yeah, here come the blues
Judas had them too
Here come the blues, here come the blues
What are we to do?
Because I hear the only way out is to go straight through
Yes I guess the only way left is to go right through
