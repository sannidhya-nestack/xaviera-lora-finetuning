No more I travel, no more I ride
Don't look in the bottom of the bottle where I used to hide
The roof is leaking, there's a sign outside it says
No place like home
Well there's no place like home
Well your ruby red slippers they're clicking three times
And you're wishing upon a star and that old children's rhyming
Lord I hope they make it back in time
Cause there's no place like home
No place like home
[Silence]
So don't you bring me no silver, no diamonds, no gold
And don't you bring me no sadness, I don't wanna be told
Don't let them shatter all the dreams a man can hold
there's no place like home
So no more I travel and no more will I ride
Don't look in the bottom of the bottle where I used to hide
The roof is leaking there's a sign outside it says
There's no place like home
Well there's no place like home
No place like home
There's no place like home, no, no
