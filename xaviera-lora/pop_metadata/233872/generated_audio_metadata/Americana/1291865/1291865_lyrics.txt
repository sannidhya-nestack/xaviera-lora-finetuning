I'm just a regular joe
From the heart of the country
Some folks I know
Think I'm kinda grumpy
Guess I can be hardcore
Too rough around the edges
Risk keeping score
I'll give you three guesses
I don't really care'cause
Don't wanna be nobody's hero
Ain't got nothing to lose
Since I'm bad and zero
Might be a poor excuse
Of a knight in shining armor
Not a ladies man or snake charm
Don't wanna be nobody's hero
But if you're looking for a bacon and eggs kind of guy
Who loves the outdoors, we can give it a try
But I'm not defending your honor or your pride
No need for pretending or tell stories about who lied
Don't really care,'cause
Don't wanna be nobody's hero
Ain't got nothing to lose
Since I'm bad zero
Might be the poor excuse
Of a knight in shining armor
Not a ladies man or snake charm
Don't wanna be nobody's hero
But if you're looking for a bacon and eggs kind of guy
Who loves the outdoors, we can give it a try
But I'm not defending your honor or your pride
Or tell stories about who lied
I don't really care'cause
Don't wanna be nobody's hero
Ain't got nothing to lose since I'm bad and zero
Might be a poor excuse
But the night is shining on, I'll leave
