I had a dream that we were sailing on the sea
And everyone we knew was sailing by our side
We made it down to where the ocean meets the trees
And through the equatorial and tropic tide
We sailed around until we found a southern pole
Then made it back to where another journey starts
I circumnavigate the oceans of your soul
You're batting down the hatches of your heart
Cruel seas pass me by
Sorrow and pain is all come and gone
Hold me here while I'm a little dreaming here
I woke up in a bath and all my clothes were on
It was a long and sunny golden afternoon
It must have been the day we made it by the pond
It must have been that 22nd day of June
I walk into the sunlight falling on your yard
And find a place where I can sit and scratch my head
I try to hold on to the memory but it's
I close my eyes and off to dream again
June leaves and July
August rain is all coming on
All these dandelions
Follow your dreaming head
I fall into your arms and look up to the stars
I find a new moon flower growing on my fence
There was rhythm in the passing of the cars
Was it just a dream?
I listened to the sweethearts of the rodeo
I listened to the distant holy thunder crack
I tried to run but I could find no place to go
But I hit the road it hit me back
Moonbeam satellites
Solar parades all summer long
Oh these candle lights
Follow your dreaming head
Cruelty's passed me by
The sorrow and pain is all coming on
Hold these dandelions
Follow your dreaming hair
