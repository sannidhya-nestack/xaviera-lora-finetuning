Before I got to G ia I was running scared
Ran on my back in loneliness I was all alone
I was watching out for the signs
Now I got to G ia I ain't going home, no
Man, I worked my fingers to the bone
Doing my job to pay for what I own
If I could've changed it, man, I would
But before I got to G ia, I wasn't doing too good, no
She took her time to change me
Change me like she could
She took her time to heal me
And healed me for good
by the time I got to G ia I was running scared
Rain on my back like all the things I felt inside
But hey, I don't wanna do this all alone
But before I got to G ia I was on my own
Rain on my back, running scared and all alone
Now I got to G ia, I ain't going home
Now I got to G ia, I ain't going home
Now I got to G ia, I ain't going home
Now I got to G ia, I ain't going home
