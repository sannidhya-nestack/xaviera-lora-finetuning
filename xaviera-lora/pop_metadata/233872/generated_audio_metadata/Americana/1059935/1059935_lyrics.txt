They shot'em down, using it up
In Baltimore, using it up
More stretchers, using it up
More flower beds, using it up
Emergency, using it up
More Cheerios, using it up
To see the house and you're wanting to settle
And settle and settle down
Using it up, things are getting
Using it up, more fragile
Using it up
Through scarcity, using it up
They take control, using it up
More value, using it up
Gonna take some time, using it up
To enjoy it and getting to know you
Better and better and better
Now using it up
Going, going, going on
Kicking stones along the road
I now know what makes me strong
Going, going, now long gone
On the surface, using it up
No clarity, using it up
You gotta break through, using it up
See what's going on, using it up
You gotta look down, using it up
Much deeper, using it up
To see the gold shining brilliantly
Richer and richer and richer
Still using it up
Going, going, going gone
Kicking stones along the road
I now know what makes me strong
Going, going, now I'm going
Going, going gone
Kicking stones along the road
I now know what makes me strong
Going, going, now long gone
