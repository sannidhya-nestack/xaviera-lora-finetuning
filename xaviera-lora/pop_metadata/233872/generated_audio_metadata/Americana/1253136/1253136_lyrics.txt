His daddy took off when his mama died
His grandma raised him
He grew up angry, full of devil's fire
She prayed to save him
Though he'd say hateful things that hurt
There was love in her eyes
He turned sixteen, headed for the streets
Without a goodbye
Tire spitting gravel
Like it was shot from a twenty gauge
He saw grandma cry for the first time
As he drove away
Two homeless years ago today
As he pulled up to the farmhouse gate
His hands were shaking
He could almost taste the strawberry cake
That she was baking
Chickens cackling to be fed
The rooster crowing
Nothing's changed in two long years
Like he was hoping
Tire spitting gravel
Like it was shot from a twenty gauge
Time rewinds, grandma cries and his heart begins to break
He smiles when he hears her say
Come on in, where've you been? Welcome home
Are you thirsty? Are you hungry?
My how tall you've grown
They hugged out on the porch
Standing by the kitchen door
She said what you waiting for
Come on in
She never stopped praying
He thanks God he heard her saying
Come on in, where've you been?
Welcome home, are you thirsty?
Are you hungry?
My how tall you've grown
They're hugged out on the porch
Standing by the kitchen door
She said what you waiting for
Come on in
She said what you waiting for
Come on in
Welcome home, son
