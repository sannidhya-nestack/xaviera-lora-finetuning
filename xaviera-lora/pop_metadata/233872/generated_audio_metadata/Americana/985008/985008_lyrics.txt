Up on the mountain
River flow
Jump in the water
Heal my soul
Wisdom flowing
Underground
Hidden treasure
I have found
There may be potholes in the road
I don't feel them
There may be pebbles in my shoe
See you later
I'm on my way later (see you later)
See you later
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day later
The heat and the hope and the rust go on forever (and forever)
Drumbeat dripping in the night
Take me to the morning light
See you later
Can't sit still
Later, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
See you later, whether you want to, whether you will
Later
I can feel each moment passing by
Look out for something I never could define
Oh, I'll see you later
I've got to move on
I'll be gone when the sun is rising
Later
See you later
See you later
See you later
