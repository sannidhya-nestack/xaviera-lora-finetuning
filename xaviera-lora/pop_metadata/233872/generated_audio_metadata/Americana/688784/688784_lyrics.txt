I've seen you standing nowhere
And you thought I was lying too
I've got a photograph of some step
And it's the same picture of you
And I know love is on the overground
And nothing is in on the town
Well I cannot make it so
And I think you ought to know
I broke the floor on Tuesday
And we fought until the dawn
We're not abandoned till you worry
If I had known I wouldn't have gone as true
And I know love is on the old ground
And you think that you're the love of town
Well I cannot make you so
And as if you ought to know
Walling on the dime
Feeling all the signs
Something is missing
Then I think it's all a sign
I cannot make it right
And I know
You think that we're a homeward bound
But your plans are more than overblown
And I cannot make it so
And I think you ought to know
And we know
And I think you ought to know
Oh, you ought to know
Thank you, Anna
