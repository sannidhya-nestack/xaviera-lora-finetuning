I walk down by the river
Where we shared a lifetime of years
A breeze whistled through the tree
Sweet music to my ears
Think I hear you singing
Your favorite song again
But it's only the wind
Memories have a habit
Of playing tricks on my mind
This wishful thinking
Is working overtime
I see your carefree smile
Like I used to yesterday
And I could swear your helping hands
Are guiding me on my way
Think I feel your laughter
Hug me like a long lost friend
But it's only the wind
I think you call my name every now and then
But I'm just hearing what I wanna hear
it's only the wind
Only the wind
