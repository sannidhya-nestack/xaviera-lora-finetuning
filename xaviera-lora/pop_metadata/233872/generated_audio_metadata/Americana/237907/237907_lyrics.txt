Seems like everywhere you turn
There's a group of people with the flag to burn
But they don't like what's going on round here
They're outranged and offended
Wanna protest and an amendment
And claim what they're doing's cavalier
And I see high profile folks
Who are angry with the votes
Claim they're gonna move so far away
Well I'm not one to join a fight
But I will if I think I'm right
These five words are all I've got to say
Hey, let me help you pack
I wanna make sure you don't leave nothing behind
No need to come back
Watch you're leaving here, I'll take any time
Oh, some soldier made a choice
That's why you got a voice
Try find the bad in some touchy-feely place
So here's to your blue skies and your silly compromise
Freedom's never been freed and that's a fact
Let me help you, Pat
Now there are millions of committees
Focus groups in every city
All telling us a brand new way to act
From where I grew up on the farm
My razor never did me no harm
And I thank the good lord every day for that
It's all a never ending show
About how you feel and who you know
The working man can't trust no one no more
It doesn't take much education to size up this situation
There'll come a day we'll reap just what we've sown
Hey, let me help you pack
I wanna make sure you don't leave nothing behind
No need to come back
Once you're leaving here I'll take any time
Oh some soldier made a choice
That's why you got a voice
Try find a bath in some touchy-feely place
So here's to your blue skies
And your civic compromise
Freedom's never been free in the last pack
Hey let me help you pack
I wanna make sure you don't leave nothing behind
And no need to come back
What you're leaving here, I won't take any time
Oh, some soldier made a choice
That's why you got a voice
Try finding that in some touchy-feety place
So here's to your blue skies
And your silly compromise
Freedom's never been freed that fast
Let me help you pack
All freedom's never free and that's a fact
Let me help you, Pat
Let me help you, Pat
Let me help you, Pat
