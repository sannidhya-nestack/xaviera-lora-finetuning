I was born no good, I was raised bad
My mama's love I never had
You however heard that it's good
All you ever know is love in the world
I'm moonshine, you're daylight
I'm moonshine your daylight
You're Alabama
I'm New Orleans
We meet in the middle of the in between
You shake us it off
I'm rock and roll yeah
But we got rhythm baby in our souls
I'm moonshine your daylight
I'm moonshine, you're daylight
Opposites attract, it's a well known fact
We only do what's natural
It's gotta be fate, nothing to debate
It must be something magical
Ooh, you got religion and you're single (you're single, you're single)
Ooh, cows have you, babe (I know that love's a burden)
I'm moonshine, your only light (your only light)
I'm moonshine, your daylight
I'm moonshine, your daylight
I'm moonshine, your daylight
