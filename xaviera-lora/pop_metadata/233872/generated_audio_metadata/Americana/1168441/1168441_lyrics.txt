All I could do was listen on the perfect August night
We walked the cliffs over Newport watching waves of mountains height
She warned me not to listen then she made me feel her heart
Still a bleeding sorrow since her love and her hand parted
I listened on to all her talking
It seemed like the evening sun stopped setting
I never let on just how her love had caught me there
While she was crying how much she loved him
And how he never understood
I did not interrupt her
I just let her ramble on like she was
All at once it seemed I felt her fading smile
That timing hit me like a flash of fire
All the while she held me burning with desire
Was the last thing on her mind
When I saw her just today I thought she would stop on by
But there she goes just a step in as I listen
To her silent goodbye
Her silent goodbye
In silence, goodbye
Yet another goodbye
Yeah, goodbye
Six months rolled by and I could hardly breathe
That woman held my heart between her knees
She knew just how to make a man believe
But still the last thing on her mind
She phoned me up today, still don't wonder why
But I kept on talking while I listened
For her silent goodbye
That silent goodbye
Another silent goodbye
Yet another goodbye
