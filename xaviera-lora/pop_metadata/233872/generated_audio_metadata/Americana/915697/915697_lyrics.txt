A blaze of solar wind must be your father
You must have heard the music of the spheres
You've wild ideas of what it means to love me
Look right here, I'm right here
I walk this earth and wander through the canyons
At dusk I rest in caverns'til the dawn
Excavate the stones for buried treasure
Then you're gone down to the bone
That's where you'll find me
Your dazzling show will only blind me
Down to the bone
Last night I dreamt about you, you were flying
Your face upturned, your arms stretched out in the air
You thought that you were reaching for me
Babe, I wasn't there, I'm not there
I'm standing on this island in the ocean
The water scatters diamonds to the sky
I search for you up there but still I'm left here shielding my eyes
Down to the wall, land on the ground for me
Your dazzling show only astounds me
From star to stone I search for a friend now
Am I alone or will you descend now
Down to the bone
Where are you now, so hard to see?
Are you circling the sun?
High above the trees, must be lonely there
Will you fold your wings and fall to me?
A blaze of solar wind must be your father
You must have heard the music of the spheres
You've wild ideas of what it means to love me
Look right here, I'm right here
I walk this earth and wander through the canyons
At dusk I rest in cabins'til the dawn
Excavate the stones for buried treasure
Then you're gone again
Down to the wall
That's where you'll find me
Your dazzling show
Will oh only blind me
From star to stone
I search for a friend now
Am I alone
Or will you descend now
Down to the bone
Oh, down to the bone
Am I alone?
From star to stone
Bone
Down to the bone
