I hit the blacktop with a busted map
Coffee in hand and a dream in my lap
Radio crackles like my rebel soul
Chasing down stories that ain't been told
Highway dust right to the sea
Running wild with nobody with me
Steel strings humming my name
Freedom's burning in the fast lane
Oh, I ain't looking back
No one to blame
Gas station gospel, motel blues
Boots on the dash and worn out news
Every mile's a memory I never planned
But I write'em down as I travel this land
Wind in my hair, heart on fire
Every detour just feeds the desire
No roots, no chains, just open sky
I was born to roam
Don't ask why, highway dust right to the sea
Running wild with nobody with me
Steel strings humming my name
Freedom's burning in the fast lane
Oh, I ain't looking back
No one to blame
