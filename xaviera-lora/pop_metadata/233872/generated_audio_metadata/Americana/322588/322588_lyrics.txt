Pets talk the whole world round
Pets use the very same sounds
High to dee, low to doe
They're the sounds that kids know
Kids seem to understand
Understand in every land
Sound of thee around the world band
I'm Bucci the hound with a woof woof sound
I bark the whole world around
I'm Pickles the cat, a purring sound
Meow the world around
I'm Tweety the bird, haven't you heard?
The sounds I chirp, they're my words
I'm Polly Wog Polly too young for a sound
But I'll grow up to be Polly the frog
And you'll hear me ribbit the world round
Two, three, pets talk the whole world round
Pets use the very same sounds
High to dee, low to do
They're the sounds that kids know
Kids seem to understand
Understand in every land
Sound of thee around the world, man
The sound of thee around the world, man
