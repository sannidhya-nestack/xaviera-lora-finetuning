Come on, give it all you got
Get out on that stage
Tell a good joke, hope they know what it's about
Make this one of those days
Believe in what you do
Show the real you
Then take a bow before the day is over
Show a smile, let it reach your eyes
Tell the world you're grateful for here and now
Then take a bow
Be bold, you can make that reach
Set off your own spark
Share an idea, invent your very own brand
Time to leave your mark
Give thanks and compliments
To your audience
Then take a bow before the day is over
Show a smile, let it reach your eyes
Tell the world you're grateful for here and now
Then take a bow
Show your admiration
Stand up, walk out front
Be the celebration
Enjoy the moment
Then take a bow before the day is over
Show a smile, let it reach your eyes
Tell the world you're grateful for here and now
Then take a bow
Take a bow, before the day is over, show a smile, let it reach your eyes, to the world you're grateful for here and now, then take a bow
