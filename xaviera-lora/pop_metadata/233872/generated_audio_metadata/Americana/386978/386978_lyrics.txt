There's people talking nowadays
They say this nation needs to change
Grace and truth have blown away
They're never coming back
America thought your spirit might have died
Then realized it was with us all the time
America, some say you're gone
But I hear your voice, still hear your song
It's in the earth, the fields and farms
A mountain's majesty, my America
A motorcycle engine hums
She's heading south to find the sun
As free and wild as horses run
Then comes rolling back to home
America thought your spirit might have died
Then realized it was with us all the time
America, some say you're gone
But I hear your voice, still hear your song
It's in the rivers, streams, and ponds
Our mountains, majesty
My America
The Rockies and Sierras tall
Can take your breath away
Hudson and Missouri white
Make me believe
In a brand new day
In America
America, some say you're gone
But I hear your voice, still hear your song
It's in the land, the fields and farms
Our mountains majesty
My America, America
Some say you're gone
But I hear your voice
Still hear your song
Montana wind and cold Maine air
Can find you everywhere
In America
In America
My America
My America (America)
