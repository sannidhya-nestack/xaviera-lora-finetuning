I've been dogged, I've been driven, I can't cry this time
Why you misuse and confuse me, Lordy hold me down inside
I was standing by the river, watching the water flow
And like that river, Lord, I gotta row
I been talked down, I been slowed down
You don't want me no more
Yeah, that's alright, I got another girl
Living out on the other shore
I was standing by the river watching the water flow
And like that river I gotta row home
Gotta get away
We need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need to get back home, we need -<|22.68|>
And sometimes I wonder what in the world I'm gonna do
Yeah, my good girl left me and my sweetheart she left me too
I was standing by the river watching the water flow
And like that red ball I got to roll
Gotta get away
Gotta get away
Gotta get away
Hey hey gotta get away
