Ooh la la, how can this be?
Can you see what I see?
Ooh la la, look at this
My eyes cannot believe
That something so marvelous can be staring back at me
Ooh la la, how can this be
Can you see what I see
A sparkle here, a sparkle there
My eyes cannot believe
That something so marvelous can be staring back at me
Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la-la
Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-La-La
Ooh la la, how can this be
Can you see what I see
Nike was made for you and me
My eyes cannot believe
That something so marvelous
Can be staring back at me
Ooh la la, ooh la la la
Ooh la la, ooh la la la
Ooh la la, ooh la la la
Ooh la la, ooh la la la
