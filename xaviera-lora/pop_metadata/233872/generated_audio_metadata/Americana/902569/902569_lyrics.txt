Well, I made a pact with the devil, oh, some long time ago
Said, "Boy, I'll take your troubles away, but the whiskey's gotta flow"
Well I went ahead I said yeah to him
my train was about to go
I lost my heart and I lost my head
Way on down where the cypress grow
I'm giving it up, I'm giving it up
Gonna throw that bottle away
So long I've been a drinking man
But I'm done with you today
Oh, I've been drowning in a river with water the color of gold
But you can't win before losing, Lord
This road's so hard to hold, oh yeah
Well, I ain't lost, just never found
The place where I'm going to
Like a long lost bird flying south
I ot what it already knew
I'm giving it up, I'm giving it up
Gonna throw that bottle away
So long I've been a drinking man
But I'm done with you today
I'm giving it up, I'm giving it up
Gonna throw that bottle away
So long I've been a drinking man
But I'm done with you today
Oh, I've been drowning in a river with water the color of gold
But you can't win for losing love is oh so hard
I'm giving it up, I'm giving it up, gonna throw that bottle away
So long I've been a drinking man, but I'm done with you today
I'm giving it up, I'm giving it up, gonna throw that bottle away
So long I've been a drinking man, but I'm done with you today
I'm giving it up, I'm giving it up, gonna throw that bottle away
So long I've been a drinking man, but I'm done with you today
I'm giving it up, I'm giving it up, gonna throw that bottle away
So long I've been a drinking man, but done with you today
