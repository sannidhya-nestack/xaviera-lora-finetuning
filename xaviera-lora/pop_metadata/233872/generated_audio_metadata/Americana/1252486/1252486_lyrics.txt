Well she lies and she cheats
She mess around with everyone that she meet
And she lies all the time
Doing the way I can call her mine
And she lies on the phone saying
I can't believe a word that she saying
And she lies and she cheats
She look so good walking next to me
Cause she lies all the time
There ain't no way that I can call her mine
And she lies on phone saying
I can't believe a word that she say
Now she lies and she cheats
She mess around with everyone that she meet
And she lies all the time
There ain't no way I can call her mine
She lies on from say
I can't believe in what that she said
She lies and she cheats
She look so good walking next to me
