Hey, hey, hey, I never said I knew for sure
I ain't no visionary, I'm an entrepreneur
And if you got a message, won't you send a telegram?
Yes, I will be your hero for a grand
You're always finding something wrong
I just want to sing my songs for you
I'm packing all the action
But you can't get no satisfaction
Hey, hey, hey, I never said I knew for sure
I ain't no visionary, I'm an entrepreneur
And if you got a message, won't you send a telegram?
Yes, I will be your hero program
I have a plan to catch your eye
The very next time you pass by
And then I'll sing my songs for you
Check one two one two
And if you got a message won't you send a telegram
Yes I will be your hero for a gram
Yes if you got a message won't you send a telegram
Yes I will be your hero for a grand
Yes I will be your hero for a grand
Yes I will be your hero for a grand
