Is the naked truth
Is what I want from you
Nothing else matters
Nothing else will do
Lies make me wanna fight
Nail and tooth
So all I wanna hear from you
Is the naked truth
If you wanna please me
I'll show you where to start
Don't cross your fingers
While you're crossing your heart
I wish I could believe you
But I still have some doubt
I haven't quite decided
The jury's still out
The naked truth is what I want from you
Nothing else matters, nothing else will do
Lies make me want to fight, nail and tooth
So all I want to hear from you is the naked truth
What I want
Don't make no promises
That I know you can't keep
Just put all your lies asleep
This a naked truth
Is what I want from you
Nothing else matters
Nothing else will do
Lies make me wanna fight
Nail and tooth
So all I wanna hear from you
Is a naked truth
Is what I want from you
Nothing else matters
Nothing else will do
Lies make me wanna fight
Nail and tooth
So all I wanna hear from you is a naked truth
So all I wanna hear from you is a naked truth
