Hurry down to the Kelso Station, I'll be there, I am waiting
Hurry down to the Kelso Station, don't give your love to anyone else but me
Leaving from the Kelso Station, you can't miss me, I'll be waiting
Leaving from the Kelso Station, and I won't be back for many a good long day
Hurry down to the Kelso Station, I am there, I am waiting
Hurry down to the Kelso Station, don't give your love to anyone else but me
I'm leaving from the Kelso station
You can miss me, I'll be waiting
Leaving from the Kelso station
And I won't be back for many a good long day
I'm leaving from the Kelso station
You can't miss me, I am waiting
Leaving from the Kelso station
Let's blow this dusty town and ride away
Let's blow this dusty town and ride away
