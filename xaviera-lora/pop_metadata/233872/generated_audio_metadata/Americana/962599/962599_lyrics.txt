I've been looking everywhere
Trying to find another girl like you
I've been looking real hard
Trying to find another girl like you
Cause ever since you went away
I've been looking everyday
But I haven't found another girl
To brighten up my day
So I'm still looking
Looking for a girl like you
A pretty girl like you
I've been sitting here thinking about
Where to find another girl like you
There's not a single destination
Where I can find another girl like you
I've been looking high and low, everywhere I go
But my search has come up empty, I got nothing more to show
I'm still looking, looking for a girl like you
A pretty girl like you
There's not a question in my mind
That I'll never find another girl like you
There's not a girl around this town
Who walks or talks or sounds a bit like you
So if you're ever back my way and you're feeling all alone
Don't hesitate to call me I'll be waiting by the phone
Cause I'm still looking
Looking for a girl like you
Pretty girl like you
A pretty girl like you
Pretty girl like you
