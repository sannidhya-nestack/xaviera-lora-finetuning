Pour me another sleeve of stout
My insides twist about
While I am drinking away my two weeks of pay
Spend it all to blackout
For a time I was a logger
Chasing chokers on the hill
Through the rain and the mud, the slash and the blood
Till I finally logged my fill
For me another sleeve of stout
Buying size twist of out
Why I'm drinking away my two weeks of pay
Spend it all to black out
And once I had me a young wife
But we had no child
Soon I broke her heart, lord she did her part
Left me drunk and stoned and wild
Pour me another sleeve of stout
My inside's twist about
I am drinking away my two weeks of pay
Spending all to black out
It seems my health is leaving
I'll catch me one last ride
Through the corners of hell
I bid you farewell
Pour me another for the ride
Or me another sleeve of stout
My insides twist about
I am drinking away my two weeks of pay
Spend it all to black out
Or me another sleeve of stout
My insides twist about
I am drinking away my two weeks of pay
Spend it all to black out
