I like the way you smell today, tomorrow you might stink
Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye, that's what I think
Don't think too much, don't think too much, don't think too much
You might hurt your brain if you think too much
It quacks like a monkey, but it's a humperdink
Aye aye aye aye aye aye, that's what I think
Don't think too much, don't think too much, don't think too much
You might hurt your brain if you think too much
Don't think too much, don't think too much, don't think too much
You might hurt your brain if you think too much
I like the way you smell today, tomorrow's you might stink
Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye
That's what I think
Think too much, don't think too much, don't think too much
You might hurt your brain if you think too much
Don't think too much, don't think too much, don't think too much
You might hurt your brain if you think too much
Don't think too much, don't think too much, don't think too much
You might hurt your brain if you think too much
You might hurt your brain if you think too much
You might hurt your brain if you think too much
