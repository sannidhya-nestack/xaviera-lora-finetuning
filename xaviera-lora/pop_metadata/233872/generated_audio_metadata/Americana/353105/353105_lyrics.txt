I was there riding shotgun in the dark
I was there riding shotgun in the dark
Well, I was riding shotgun on a moonless night
I was watching your face child in a dashboard light
I was there riding shotgun in the dark
No one knows how I feel except you
No one knows how I feel except you
No, no, no
No one knows just how I feel
Got that Texas highway underneath my wings
No one knows how I feel
Riding shotgun with you at the wheel
Drive on, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Drive on
Lord, lord, lord, I was there (I was there)
A violent shotgun (I was there)
In the dark (in the dark)
I was there (I was there)
A violent shotgun (I was there)
In the dark (in the dark)
I was riding shotgun on a moonless night
Watching your face child in a dashboard light
I was there riding shotgun in the dark
In the dark, in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, I'm riding shotgun, in the dark, in the dark, why don't you take my hand, let's ride together
