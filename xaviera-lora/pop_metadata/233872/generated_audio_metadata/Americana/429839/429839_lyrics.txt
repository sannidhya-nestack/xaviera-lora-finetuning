Isn't this a lovely day
He smiles and sends us on our way
And we thank him and we tip our hats
And he bows and offers his congrats
A lovely day
Such a lovely day
A lovely day, such a lovely day
Strolling through the gardens as the piper plays
Stranded pearls catching in the wind
A clutch of daisies and a white book spent
Isn't this a lovely day
A promise and a pink bouquet
And the prelate standing in his yard
Folds his hands and offered to the bard
A lovely day
Such a lovely day
A lovely day
Take me up, up, up, up, up, up
Ah, ah, ah
