Well my girl she told me to mend my ways before it was too late
And I didn't listen to what she said
I'm in the doghouse
I'm a dirty old dog in the doghouse again
Well I roamed the backyard and the alleyways as far as I could on my chain
Sleep in the cold in the pouring rain
I'm in the doghouse
I'm a dirty old dog in the doghouse again
I'm in the doghouse oh me oh my
Here in the doghouse that's where I lie
If come tomorrow I won't mend my ways
I'm gonna sleep in the doghouse for the rest of my days
I bark at the moon, I beg for my bone
I keep scratching at all of my fleas
I know it ain't much but I'll call at my home
I'm in the doghouse
I'm a dirty old dog in the doghouse again
I'm in the doghouse, oh me oh my
Here in the doghouse, that's where I lie
And if come tomorrow, I won't mend my ways
I'm gonna sleep in the doghouse
For the rest of my days
I'm in the doghouse
Oh me, oh my
Here in the doghouse
That's where I lie
And if come tomorrow
I won't make my ways
I'm gonna sleep in the doghouse
For the rest of my days
Well, I promised her that I'm gonna mend my ways
But I guess I'm just too late
