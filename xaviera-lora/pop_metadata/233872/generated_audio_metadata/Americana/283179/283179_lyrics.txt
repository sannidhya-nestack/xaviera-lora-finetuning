Well, I went on up to the big old sky and they all asked for you
They all asked for you
Why'd I even inquire about you?
I went on up to the big old sky and they all asked for you
The ducks asked, the eagles asked, and the buzzards all asked me too
I went on down to the deep blue sea and they all asked for you
They all asked for you
Why they even inquired about ya
I went on down to the deep blue sea and they all asked for you
The shark asked, the whale asked, and the barracuda asked me too
