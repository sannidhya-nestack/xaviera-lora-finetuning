Gather'round the table
Never et your roots
Family faith and fables
There are no substitutes
We want to be accepted
Differences are my patch quilt
Loving hearts keep us
Let's break down the walls we've built
Come from a place of love
Your past is no
Disgrace
Hold onto your visions down the road
Joy awaits all you're in search of
Come from a place of love
When the struggle is real
The Smokies always call me home
Mama taught me how to feel
My spirit strong wherever I roam
Having next to nothing is a good place to start
Trust in your fearless heart
Come from a place of love
Your past is no disgrace
Hold on to your visions down the road
Joy awaits all you're in search of
Come from a place of love
I come from a place of love
I come from a place of love
