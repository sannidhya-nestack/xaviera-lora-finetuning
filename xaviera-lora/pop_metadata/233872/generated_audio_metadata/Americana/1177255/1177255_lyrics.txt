I've heard some pretty strange excuses
But not quite as lame as this
I've seen lovers try some mean abuses
But not one of yours involved a kiss
Why has their sweet love gone flying?
Away like a page in the breeze
It seems it ain't no use in my trying
To find any help of all my means
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't you ever lose your spirit
The one that began with free
You'd never choose to hear it
Or show a little tenderness to me
While you're starving me out on your shelf
You say stalling is good for your health
Gotta suck it up now and find out how
This strange blade will shake itself out
I dare not try and wait for a new one cell by day
Could there ever be anyone else
That knows me just as well as yourself
Been right on the edge of a whale
But I just can't seem to bail
While you're starving me out on your shell
You say stalling is good for your health
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, won't you stop being beyond your shell?
All you've been starving is good for your health
So have a nice life, the best, best life
In a heartbeat you'll find someone else
Still have a nice life, the best, best life
In a heartbeat you'll find someone else
