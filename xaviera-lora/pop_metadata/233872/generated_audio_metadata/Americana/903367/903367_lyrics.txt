All the games we play
Crying out for luck to come my way
Queen of Hearts is calling but I'm on a losing streak
I can shake this mood
Play a winning hand to pull me through
Queen of hearts she's calling but I'm on a losing streak
King of space is laughing and now he keeps taunting me
Here I go, life is a roll of the dice
All alone, the cops say you're falling right
Here I go, losing my shirt on a dream
I'm gonna start the flow and break this losing streak
Now the story's sad
I can't win a girl
It never lasts
Queen of Hearts is calling
But I'm on a losing streak
King of Spades, he keeps laughing
When I'm on my banded knees
Here I go
Life is a roll of the dice
All alone
The cops say you're falling right
Here I go
Losing my shirt on a dream
I'm gonna stop the flow
And break this losing streak
Here I go
Life is a roll of the dice
All alone
The constantly falling ride
Here I go
Losing my shirt on a dream
I'm gonna stop the flow
And break this loop
Losing, losing, losing streak
