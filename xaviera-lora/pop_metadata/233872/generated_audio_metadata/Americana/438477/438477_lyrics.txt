With my right hand pounding on my left breast
With my feet taking hold of the half rest
And it's then we prepare for the big test when we go
Hear a thump and a stir from the big sky
Take the sign that you get from the big guy
Now you pray that you get to the big fly when we go
Hey mama, what's the matter with you? Hey papa, what's the matter with you? Hey mama, I say it's time to go
Hey mama, what's the matter with you? Hey papa, what's the matter with you? Hey mama, I say it's time to go
Hey
Me I love with the heart for the broken
It's a badge that I wear not a token
And it leads me to be so outspoken
When I go
Now and then I et where I came from
Like my hand torn away from the big drum
So I beat hard on it till it goes numb
Then I go
Hey mama, what's the matter with you? Hey papa, what's the matter with you? Hey mama, I say it's time to go
Hey mama, what's the matter with you? Hey papa, what's the matter with you? Hey mama, I say it's time to go
Just be good and kind
And it will all pan out in time
Read what you have sown
if you did it right
You'll never be alone
Just be good and kind
And it will all turn out in time
Read what you have sewn
if you did it right you'll never be alone
I'm not sure if I'll go where the air's clear
I just hope that I go where there's no fear
So I'll raise you a toast with my light beer when I go
And I'll dance and I'll sing with a big smile
As I make my way up through the big aisle
And we'll walk hand in hand through the last trial when we go
Hey Mama, what's the matter with you? Hey Papa, what's the matter with you? Hey Mama, I say it's time to go
Hey Mama, what's the matter with you? Hey Papa, what's the matter with you? Hey Mama, I say it's time to go
Hey mama, what's the matter with you? Hey papa, what's the matter with you? Hey mama, I say it's time to go
Hey mama, what's the matter with you? Hey papa, what's the matter with you? Hey mama, I say it's time to go
Hey mama, what's the matter with you? Hey papa, what's the matter with you? Hey mama, I say it's time to go
Hey mama, what's the matter with you? Hey papa, what's the matter with you? Hey mama, I say it's time to go
