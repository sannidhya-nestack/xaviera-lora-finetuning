(Vocalizing)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
[Muffled singing]
A young man walked up to me
In the lowdown bar room one night
He said can I have your drink miss Vickie
It's called the American Snakebite
He says hey I'm just a nice girl
Looking for some peace and quiet
Except one drink can do you no harm
Why don't you go ahead and try it
I drink that snakebite
Sniff my poison in my brain
Make me feel so goddamn awful
I'll never touch that drink again
I was about to take a drink
When I heard a voice say hey
You drink that drink, Miss Vickie, you'll end up in a real bad way
I didn't listen, drank the whole lot in one go
Next thing I remember, my poor head hit the floor
I'll drink that drink, Miss Vickie
Sleep like poison in my head
Make me feel so goddamn awful
I never touch that dream again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'll never say bye, I'll never say bye, I'll never say bye, I'll never say bye
Wasn't in my brain
I lay suffering in my bedroom
For a whole week or more
Even Lil' Rosie came in to see me
Took one look and threw up all over the floor
But let this be a lesson to ya
Ain't no cryin' shame
The one thing's for sure
I'll never touch snakebite again
I'll drink that snakebite
Snakebite poison in my brain
Make me feel so good and I'm a fool
I'll never touch that finger again
A scotsman or a jew
You drink that snakebite
Same thing gonna happen to you
Been all around the world
Been all over the place
You drink that snakebite child
You'll end up flat in your face
I drink that snakebite
Snakebite poison in my brain
Say it again
Makes me feel so god damn awful
I never touch that trigger again
I'll never say bye
I wanna say bye
I wanna say bye
A lot of people ask me one question
What was in that drink you drank?
I say cider, vodka, lemonade, the devil himself, I think
Let me feel a lesson to ya, this sorry tale of mine
Someone offers you a snake bite
Tell him to stick it where the sun don't shine, I drink that snake bite
Snake bite poison in my brain, oh come on, come on, say it again
Made me feel so god damn awful
I'll never touch that drink again
