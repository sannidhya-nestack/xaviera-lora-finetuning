I was born in Baton Rouge, a child of the maritime
Grew up on a fishing boat that my daddy built by hand
My mama cooked and I was crew as daddy worked the net lines
From the mouth of the Cajun Bayou to the heart of the Caribbean
One day I asked why we don't settle down
And have ourselves a house on solid ground
Daddy left and said to me
Boy we're gypsies of the sea
When we're together on this boat we call it home
Didn't know then that his words would last me all my days
He sent me to a school on land to see things from their side
School filled my head like Easter church with new ideas and other ways
And choice between my memories and the dreams of a different life
But fate don't always give us a chance to choose
My daddy had a stroke when I finished school
He said you must live your life
But take care of your mama right
Where the trade winds blow you both you call it home
We call it home
Daddy passed that summer and we buried him at sea
Now I run this family business and my mama's here with me
I promised that his words would guide me, keep his memory deep inside me
So I renamed that boat the Gypsy Three
I met my wife in Mobile and asked her for a hand
She said if you're making me a vow I want to settle on solid ground
There's a white church on a hill where my family owns some land
If I'm going to raise our children it's they will settle down
So I built us our house next to that church
But I work my daddy's boat and I lift his word
From that hill we see the bay
Think of him each day and pray
Got a family of my own and we call it home
We call it home
Na na na na we call it home
We call it home
