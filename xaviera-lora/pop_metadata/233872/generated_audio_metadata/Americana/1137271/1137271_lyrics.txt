Man I'm on your mind just on the time
Looking for a place to hide
Touched shelter with
The belly of shade sun's hot
Say why don't you stay a while
You don't know now you will never
Say what you wanna say hey hey
When you see me mama gone
You realize nothing's for free
Ah, concert, the woman who went from world, world found by her side
Concert broke and the hell ran low, slow that woman changed her mind
If you don't know now you will never see what you wanna see
When you see me and papa gone you'll realize nothing's for free
Yeah, hold on, the older woman
Out in the wilderness
Do you know the way out of here?
I've been there saved by a kiss
Yeah, now, now, now, you won't laugh out
Say what you wanna say
When you see me by my God
You realize nothing's for free
Hey, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hey, ooh, ooh, ooh
Weeheehee!
Love, love
