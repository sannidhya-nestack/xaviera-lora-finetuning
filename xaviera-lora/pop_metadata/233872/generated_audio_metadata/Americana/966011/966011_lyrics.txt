Most things in life just pass me by
I guess I could sit around and cry
nothing ever comes my way
Until you smiled at me that day
And when you looked in my direction
The day took on a certain perfection
So now we're travelling down this road
Emotions high on overload
God knows what tomorrow brings
For now this tired engine sings
when you look in my direction
The day takes on
A certain perfection
Who knows where the days go
They disappear so fast
We only count the memories
Make'em matter, make'em last
The breath of God blows where it will
Feel it strong when you're holding still
Stand with me, stand until we fall
Most days we're lucky just to crawl
Still when you look in my direction
The day takes on a certain perfection
