I remember the stories
The ones that they told
Of sunken treasure and pirates gold
Fifteen dead men on a dead man's chest
And a bottle of rum sitting heavy on your breath
Well now he got a patch on one eye
Got teeth as black as coal
He said he knows a way a man can find that pirate's gold
He took a galleon, he sailed across the sea
With a crew of mercenary vagabonds and thieves singing
Yo-ho-ho
I still remember the tales they told
And yo-ho-ho
Just keep on searching for pirates gold
He's just a dead man on a dead man's chest
In the coat of Davy Jones his bones are laid to rest
Let all the fishes and the mermaids know
That they never gonna find no, find no pirate's gold
Singing, "Yo-ho-ho"
I still remember the tales they told
And now, "Yo-ho-ho"
Just keep on searching for pirate's gold
You gotta keep on searching for pirate's gold
Just keep on searching for pirate's gold
Your home
