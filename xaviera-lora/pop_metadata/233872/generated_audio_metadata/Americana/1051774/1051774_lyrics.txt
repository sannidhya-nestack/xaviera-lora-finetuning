I was born in this land some twenty years ago
And I've worked through the turning of the seasons
And it's hard to bear when I see him standing there
And the bailiffs cannot look me in the eye
And I'll never understand how the paper in his hand
Could break the soul of many a proud man
So I have to go, I've got to let you know
My ship will leave the harbor in the morning
Cross the sea so blue, but my heart will stay with you
I'm bound for New York City in the morning
Now it's with a heavy heart
I walk my childhood streets
Past the bar where we'd sing into the night
Past the hall where I danced
Where I had my first romance
I believed I would stay here all my days
And I'll never understand how the paper in his hand
Could break the soul of many a proud man
So I'll have to go
I've got to let you know
My ship will leave the harbor in the morning
Cross the sea so blue
But my heart will stay with you
I'm bound for New York City in the morning
And I'll never understand how the paper in his hand
Could break the soul of many a poor
So I'll have to go, I've got to let you know
My ship will leave the harbor in the morning
Cross the sea so blue, but my heart will stay with you
I'm bound for New York City in the morning
So I have to go, I've got to let you know
My ship will leave the harbour in the morning
Cross the sea so blue, but my heart will stay with you
I'm bound for New York City in the morning
Yes, I'm bound for New York City in the morning
I'm bound for New York City in the morning
Yes, I'm bound for New York City in the morning
