She's twisted, she's all tangled inside
This woman needs a doctor or a good alibi
She's so twisted, she's a cheat and a lie
But I can't get her out of my mind
She's so twisted, it's only trouble she brings
Spending all my money on the craziest things
She's so twisted, one continuous flame
I can't get her out of my mind
One of these days I'm gonna tell her
That I can't take it no no more
One of these days I'm on a bell tower
Pack my bags and walk out the door
She's so twisted and she knows what to do
To push the right buttons to make a fool out of you
She's so twisted, a real lonely tune
But I can't get her out of my mind
She's twisted, that chick is insane
She's got a strange condition that her doctor can't name
She's so twisted, I think she's damaged her brain
I can't get her out of my mind
One of these days I'm gonna tell her
That I can't take it no no no more
One of these days I'm gonna belt her
Pack my bags and walk out the door
She's twisted, she don't know right from wrong
The only thing to say is that this chick is real gone
She's twisted, she's in all points alone
But I can't get her out of my mind
No, I can't get her out of my mind
Twisted
