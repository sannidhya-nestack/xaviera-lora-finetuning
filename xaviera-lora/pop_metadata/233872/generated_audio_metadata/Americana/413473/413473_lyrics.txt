I remember everything about her
Every little line on her life weathered face
Her soft brown eyes
As she looked into my soul
Everybody knows
She made the world a better place
Mama said she found her first
But she found mama
It was a God thing I think
Family destiny
Mally Lou gave a lot more than what she took from this old world
So much love came from nothing as a sharecropper's daughter
Mally Lou taught me most of life's greatest lessons
And how to live as she did and rise above it all
From the life that she first came from
That's what taught her
She was a sharecropper's daughter
She made me and everyone feel special
And to this day I'm in awe of that skill
No one else in the room ever mattered
But the two of us
And we could talk until
I couldn't keep my young eyes open anymore
And I drift away like a babe
Maddie Liu gave a lot more than what she took from this old world
So much love came from nothing as a sharecropper's daughter
Maddie Liu taught me most of life's greatest lessons
And how to live as she did and rise above it all
From the life that she first came from
That's what taught her
She was a sharecropper's daughter
And she'll always have my back
I can see her in that hat
On her way to church
Each and every Sunday
The only time I made her cry
Was when I had to say goodbye
Be strong, move on
Matty Lou gave a lot more than what she took from this old world
So much love came from nothing
As a sharecropper's daughter
Mally Lou taught me most of
Life's greatest lessons
And how to live as she did
And rise above it all
From the life that she first came from
That's what taught her
She was a sharecropper's daughter
Yeah, she was a sharecropper's daughter
