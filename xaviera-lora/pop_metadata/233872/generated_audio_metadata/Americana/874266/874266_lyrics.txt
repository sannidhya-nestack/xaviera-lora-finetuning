Soldier, the cuts don't hurt me no more
Soldier, your armor's made for war
But sometimes I'm part of the machine
Sometimes I don't think that I can bleed
And it's hard sometimes to let them go
I got a wounded heart and a fractured soul
And these gunshots they don't bother me
I'm leaking out my vanity
Oh helium you carry me away
From this life I've been living like an actor on a stage
And oh I pulled the curtains closed
I took the high road
Back home, I took the high road
I'm coming up, gotta give me some
I'm coming up, gotta give me some
Gotta give me some, give me some helium
The surgeon, the gloves don't fit me no more
The surgeon, your blade is getting dull
Sometimes I can't feel my heartbeat
Sometimes the scars won't let me heal
In his heart sometimes I'm letting go
I got a wounded heart and a fractured soul
And these gunshots they don't bother me
I'm leaking out my vanity
Oh, helium, you carry me away from this life
I've been living like an actor on a stage
And oh, I pulled the curtains closed
I took the high road back home
To the high road (Give me some)
I'm coming up (Give me some)
Gotta give me some (Give me some)
I'm coming up (Give me some)
Gotta give me some (Give me some)
Give me some (Give me some)
Gotta give me some (Give me some)
Give me some (Give me some)
Gotta give me some (Give me some)
Give us all helium
