I took my broken heart, a beating in my hand
I took her down to the bottom of the hill, all the money you give the man
Nobody hears him talking, nobody hears the truth
Nobody cares if it's an inch or a mile, they're waiting just for you
Cause God give me that, God give me that dark dark soul
I took two shiny pennies
I broke them in my hand
I took them down to the bottom of the hill
By the story teller man
Cause this time we're trying
And this time we're free
And this time I'm gonna get me a bunch
I'm gonna keep a bunch for me
Cause God give me that
God give me that dark soul baby
God give me that dark soul
God give me that dark soul baby
God give me that dark dark soul
God damn give me that dumb dumb show
I took two flying feathers, I put them in my head
I took a bag of nectar to the old town fools, no they didn't ask for it back
I took a piece to the ocean, I burned a little to the sky
I watched it rise and smoke until the sun go down, until the middle sun young dragons got give me that
Gotta give me that dark song baby, gotta give me that dark song yeah
Gotta give me that dark song baby, gotta give that dark dark song yeah
God, if you'd give me that dark, dark soul
God, if you'd give me that dark, dark soul
God, if you'd give me that dark, dark soul
