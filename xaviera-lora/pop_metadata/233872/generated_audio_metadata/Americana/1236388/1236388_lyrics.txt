The whole man
In the heartland where dreams take flight
Underneath the stars so bright
From sea to shining sea we stand tall
United as one we answer the call
Made in America, land of the free
When the spirit of hope grows wild and free
With pride in our hearts we'll always stand
For the red, white, and blue, I'm gone
From the farms to the city streets
Where every voice has a beat
In the land where dreams are born
We rise above, whether in death or scorn
Made in America, land of the free
Where the spirit of hope runs wild and free
The pride in our hearts will always stand
For the red, white and blue are all our homeland
From trials and trials we've held the line
With courage and honour our nation shines
From valleys low to mountains high
In our hearts the American spirit flies
Made in America, land of the free
Where the spirit of hope runs wild and free
With pride in our hearts we'll always stand
For the red, white and blue are all the homeland
