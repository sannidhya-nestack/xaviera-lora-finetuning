Yesterday you count my coup
Yesterday you took it whole
Didn't see nothing leave with you
But I traded off my faded soul
Count me out for paradise
Count on me for twice the pain
There ain't one thing I would not beg to count you into my blue sky
Twice ain't half the price I'll make, I can't afford but one more try
It's twice too much to give away to sell off with no alibi
Yesterday you count my coups of love and sweat and whisper
You take back all I took from you
The happy shabby songs we'd sing
Many many nights have gone
Could not stay a month or two
Not a hint of sadness songs until you came to count your coup
Take some more off hand advice before I fade away to sky
You tell him one more thing from me I will never ask for mercy
Take some more off hand advice
Heavy handed times are on
Never count your coup for twice
Still we have to carry on
Count me in for paradise
There ain't no price I would not pay
Even if I begged their price
To count on you for one sweet day
To count on you for one sweet day
To count on you for one sweet day
