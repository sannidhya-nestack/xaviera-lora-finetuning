Heirlooms and special memories I hold dear to my heart
Keepsakes of our family tree, reminders of a rocky start
Appalachian mountain history, patchwork evidence from our past
Rising out of poverty, strong traditions made to last
So precious I'll never let go of these treasures among my cladiments
Whiskey made by moonlight, searching for our freedom
Fiddle music played all night
Rhythms beating out that banjo drum
Scottish Irish canned in hand
Early roots of bluegrass
Sacred songs from a sweet homeland
Shared with every lad and lass
Souvenirs and photographs, accordion, mandolin and spoons
Mementos of classic arts and crafts, stories recorded in folksy tunes, ooh
So precious I'll never let go of these treasures among my cladiments
Whiskey made by moonlight
Searchin' for our freedom
Fiddle music played all night
Rhythm speedin' out that banjo drum
Scottish Irish hand in hand
Early roots of bluegrass
Sacred songs from a sweet homeland shared with every light and mass
So precious I'll never let go of these treasures among my cladiments, cladiments
