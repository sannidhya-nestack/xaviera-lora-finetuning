One, two, three, four
On my blanket of calls
It's your face that's been lost now
Crazy like a firecracker
Let you set off my backyard
But it feels like a bland
Time to turn and walk down the rain
Sometimes I get a jig up
But at taxpayer costs
Here lies Harvey Dooling
Do you remember your own son?
Let your body decide
Time to turn and walk down the road
Today's Spanish was weird
Got my jeans on from sea
Who has got my earring
I can't remember Friday night
Now my adolescence is gone
Time to turn and walk down the ring
Time to turn and walk down the ring
