You can't hold on to issues or you can learn to let go
You just have to choose the next thing you know
You will find your way
When you feel lost and alone
And think you don't have solutions
Things you've always known
Present like a revolution
You have more answers than you think
And in the face of confusion
If you feel like you're on the brink
There's a logical conclusion
Little distance and time
It won't all make sense, there is a reason, a reason
Life doesn't have to be so tame
You will find your way, you will find your way
Life can be full of wonder
The promise of a new start
Getting up from under
Begins with a change of heart
You will find your way
You have more in essence than you think
And in the face of confusion
If you feel like you're on the brink
There's a logical conclusion, little
Distance and time
It won't all make sense
There is a reason, a reason
Life doesn't have to be so tame
You will find your way
That's why you'll find
Oh you, oh you'll find your way, yeah
