Used to be you and me, we were quite a pair
But since I found you runnin' around, it hurts too much to care
If you cross my path again, you better be prepared
To eat your heart out when you see me, darling
Eat your heart out
When I walk on by
I find a little salt and pepper
Makes it taste a whole lot better
So eat your heart out
Just like I ate mine
Next time that you see me
I'll be dressed to kill
And when you see what you let go
It's gonna make you ill
I don't have a crystal ball
But I know you will
Eat your heart out when you see me darling
Eat your heart out when I walk on by
I find a little salt and pepper makes it taste a whole lot better
So eat your heart out just like I ate mine
Someday in your own sweet time you'll crawl back to me
Saying how you're sorry and you're tired of being free
But as far as I'm concerned your ancient history
Eats your heart out when you see me darling
Eat your heart out when I walk on by
I find a little salt and pepper makes it taste a whole lot better
So eat your heart out just like I ate mine
So eat your heart out just like I ate mine
