From Sabine to Lafayette and New Orleans
Izaka, Diana, mouth of the river
Your golden triangle is oil
Evangeline, is this what you mean
Well you can detour but don't damn the river
As I try to follow one step behind her
But you chose to love her this one or the other
Bullets are flying one side of the river
Are you standing when sides are choosing
What does it matter if I am losing
Pretty girls have long hair and they drive pickup trucks
Mercedes Benz or Rolls Royce
It's their choice it depends
So I turn on the raid video
Down here on the bayou
Cause when the lady bird touches down on an oil drilling town
In those calm gulf waters
You better not mess around when the hurricane comes down
In those rough gulf waters
My Delta D what you mean to me and what you were to be
Pitch silhouette against the dark night sea
So I turn on the raid video
Down here on the bio
Cause when the lady bird touches down on an oil drilling town in those
Calm Gulf waters
You better not mess around where the hurricane comes down on those
Rough Gulf waters
My Delta D
What you mean to me and what you were to be
Pitch silhouette against the dark night sea
