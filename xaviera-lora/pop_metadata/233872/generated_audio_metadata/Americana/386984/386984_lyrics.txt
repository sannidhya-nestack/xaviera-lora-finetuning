Just twenty-one
With all of life in front of you
And all the world to travel through
Wasn't meant to be
Just twenty-one
With so much love inside to give
Someday a home, a wife and kids
But nothing's guaranteed
There's some that get a hundred years
Don't really live at all
For some life's window closes fast
Their goodness we recall
There's some that we et who take
Hold tight to what they have
There's some like you who touch us all
Whose memory will last
Just 21
Was high school captain of the football team
Your teacher said you'd realize your dreams
Plans got rearranged
Just 21
Went off to war to defend our ways
Make the earth a better place
Help make a change
There's some that get a hundred years
Don't really live at all
For some life's window closes fast
The goodness we recall
The some that we et or take
Hold tight to what they have
The some like you who touch our soul
Whose memory will last
There's some like you who touch us all
Whose memory will last?
