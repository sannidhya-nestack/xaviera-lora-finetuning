You know it's really nice to see you
You know it's been a long long time
Since I held you in my arms
And I felt your lucky charms
And we spent some time alone just you and I
When we last said our goodbyes
Were those tears in your eyes
When I drove off in my car
You know I didn't get too far
I wanted to be back there in your arms
You know I really hate to leave you
It's not my favorite thing to do
But in another week or two
I'll be back here home with you
And we will spend some time alone just like we do
Come on Jeanie, let's get crazy
Don't say no, don't say maybe
Come on kiss me for a while
You know that'll make me smile
We will have a good old time just like we do
You know I really hate to leave you
It's not my favorite thing to do
But another week or two
I'll be back here home with you
And we will spend some time alone just like we do
And we will spend some time alone just like we do
