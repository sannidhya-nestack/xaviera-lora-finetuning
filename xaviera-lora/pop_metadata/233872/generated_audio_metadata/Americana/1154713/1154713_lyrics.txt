I wrote about us, now what about me? I guess you're gone
It's clear to see that you don't need my company
Where it is you've gone
I told you once I'm where you belong
But tell that to my heart aches long
And you don't need to sing that song
Where it is you've gone
Oh, where you gone? Ain't no damn good for me to cry
I want you back, laughing like you understood
Serious as a heart attack
I know it don't matter what I say
Where you gone it's hard to say
It don't matter much anyway
Where it is you gone
Oh where you gone ain't no damn good for me to cry
I want you back
Ain't no place for me who stood between your words
I'd wider black
I guess I'll just bid you farewell
Put down my heart of rotten hell
The hole in my soul will never tell
Where it is you've gone
That hole in my soul will never tell
Where it is you've gone
