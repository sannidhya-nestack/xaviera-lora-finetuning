This is America's moment
This is America's dream
Hope for a world filled with lasting peace
Freedom for every human being
This is one of our moments
Touching the future with our past
Our fathers built this land
Strong and proud, hand in hand
To make America our home
So many lifetimes of accomplishments
So many heroes sharing dreams
As we continue on their journey now
With God's blessing may we sing
Of a world with angels' wings
To keep us soaring through all time
Our independence will survive
And our children will thrive
In the spirit of red, white and blue
We'll always
And we thank our lucky stars
For this country of ours
And we know through all of time
Through all the mysteries of mankind
We'll have this moment of our own
We'll have this moment, we'll have this moment of our own
