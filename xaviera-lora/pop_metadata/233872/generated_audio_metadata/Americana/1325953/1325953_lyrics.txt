Not just any kind of lovin'
Not any kind of lovin'
Not any kind of lovin' will do
Not just any kind of lovin'
Not any kind of lovin'
Not any kind of lovin' will do
baby I want you
You're hotter than a pancake
More kernels than a corn
Fresh when you're awake and lovely
Since the day you're born
Oh, I'm in for some lovin', some really good lovin', some really good lovin' with you
Not just any kind of lovin', not any kind of lovin', not any kind of loving will do
'Cause baby I want you
You're hotter than a pepper
Sweeter than butter
Fresh when you're awake and love you since the day you're born
Not just any kind of loving
Not any kind of loving
Not any kind of loving will do
Not just any kind of loving
Not any kind of loving
Not any kind of loving will do
Cause baby I want you
Oh, I'm in for some lovin', some really good lovin'
Some really good lovin' with you
Baby, I want you
