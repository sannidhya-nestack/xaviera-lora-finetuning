In the midnight shadows silence reigns
Whispers echo through the dark haunting my brain
The notes of a piano, melancholic and low
A seductive melody, a tale of war
The double bass hums like a distant thunder
Brushes dance on the snare
A haunting wonder
The saxophone moans
Carrying a sense of despair
As the trumpet lingers
Filling the air
Whisper
In the night don't wake the sleeping souls
Hush your fears as the eerie jazz unfolds
Feel the tension rise with every note played
In this midnight jazz, a foreboding escapade
