A story I once heard about the hunter and the half-lime boat
Never reached, was never inside, was a half-lime boat
That's right
And the people said, how could it be? How could a boat feel so free?
One day the butcher stood way through that half-lime boat
Long came the fast flame
It went flashing by
Way over yonder
Beyond the western sky
And then one day a message come
Broken news for everyone
Jewels in darkest night
Gave some money
That's right
Said old buffalo to old crow
If I call it I know where I will go
No answer old crow and you
Flap your wings and away it flows
A long cave, a fast plane, a big wave flashing by
Way over yonder, the old western sky
