Pack up the family, then you hit the open road
So much you can't see
That will lighten up your load
You can take them up to Maine
Eat some lobster in the rain
Have some ice cream at the lighthouse
Catch a crab along the East Coast
So many ways to play
Having fun along the way
Changing scenery every day
When you ride the USA
Ride north in New Hampshire
To the Kankamangas Highway
Take a swim along Swift River
Do some camping if you do stay
Take a drive up Old Mount Washington
Climb four thousand feet
Get a bumper sticker you put on
To show the world your feet
So many ways to play
Having fun along the way
Changing scenery
Every day when you ride the USA
Shuffle off to Buffalo and see Niagara Falls
Virginia is the place to go where Appalachia calls
You can take and skyline drive Blue Ridge Parkway and the Smokies
Find yourself in Pigeon e where Dollywood will please
So many ways to play
Having fun along the way
Changing scenery everyday
When you ride the USA
Head across the Great Plains
Then you drive up to Grand Canyon
Make your way to Salt Lake City
Cross the Great Sierra, Nevada
You can hang out in the Redwoods
Head up north to Mount St. Helens
Hit Seattle, cross the Cascades
Off the glacier down to Yellowstone
So many ways to play
Having fun along the way
Changing scenery every day
When you ride the USA
Head up to the Badlands
See the carvings in Mount Rushmore
Head on south to Rocky Mountain
See Black Canyon on the Gunnison
There's cliffs and Mesa Verde
See the caves that cause bad currents
Over to the hot springs
You can land and also give
So many ways to play
Having fun along the way
Changing scenery every day
When you ride the USA
