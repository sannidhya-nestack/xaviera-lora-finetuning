I'm gonna work the holiday
To make my life more comfortable
For everyone I thought it had
Work makes life more sufferable
So complex, that's what I am
The primitive and full of anger
I don't expect you'll understand
It's gonna keep your blood away from danger
You know that I don't wanna spend another holiday with you (holiday)
I know that if I spend another holiday with you
I think I'll work another holiday (holiday, holiday)
when I'm with you, girl, I'm still alone
Will I make it through this whole day alone? (Holiday, holiday)
Seems that all my waking life I've been alone (Holiday, holiday)
Seems like all my waking life
It seems like all my waking life (I'll just find another)
All my waking life
All my life I've been alone
Ah, holiday, holiday
Ah, holiday, holiday
Ah, holiday, holiday
You know that I don't want to spend another holiday with you
Because I know that if I spend another holiday with you
I think I'll have another holiday
Truer words were never said alone
Seems like all my life has been a holiday
