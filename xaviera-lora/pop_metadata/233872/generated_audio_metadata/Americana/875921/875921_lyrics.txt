Let's put the front porch back in the music
Plug in to the power of the moon
With a washboard jug and a tub bass fiddle
Playing just a little out of tune
Picking bronze on wood is it gone for good
I want to listen to a flat tops drum
Let's put the front porch back in the music
Cause that's where it all came from
It's genuine American and born on a front porch swing
It helped our folks et when times were rough
Grandpa rocked and rolled his eyes while grandma tried to sing
She had a voice that only he could love
The banjo's grandpa named Lenz and Kenfolk kept the beat
Slightly out of time if no one knew
Just planned to please each other and the only thing as sweet
Was the cider they all shared when they were through
Let's put the front porch back in the music
Plug in through the power of the moon
With a washboard jug and a tub bass fiddle
Playing just a little out of tune
Picking bronze on wood is it gone for good
I wanna listen to a flat top strum
Let's put the front porch back in the music
Cause that's where it all came from
Put it back now
Let's put the front porch back in the music (back in the music)
Tugging to the power of the moon (to the power of the moon)
With a washboard jug and a tub in his kiss (back in the music)
Playing just a little out of tune (playing just a little out of tune)
Picking drums on wood, is it gone for good?
I wanna listen to a flat top strum
Let's put the front porch back in the music (back in the music)
Cause that's where it all came from
Let's put the front porch back in the music
that's where it all came from
