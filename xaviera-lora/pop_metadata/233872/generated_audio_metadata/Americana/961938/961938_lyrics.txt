When you're banged so post Then your heart needs grain
And crops won't grow from the drought again
Losing faith, losing sight
Take my order, little October bride
When the hounds, they picked up your track
You know that there's no turning back
Losing faith, losing sight
Take my word and let love to provide
Can you taste?
You can tell
Your heart knows
That there's poison in your well
Losin' faith
Losin' sight
Tip of the little super right
How, how, how, how it changed
And he pollies, breaking in
And he runs the whole comeback again
Losing faith, losing sight
Check my order, little old trooper ride
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
It's safe
And this ain't your
He said, "You're wrong"
Said, "Son, it's time for us to move"
Losing faith
Losing sight
Take part and learn to put right
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, say
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
