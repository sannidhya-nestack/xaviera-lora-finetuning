First thing you notice are his eyes
So clear and cold promise you the skies
Beware my love, beware my love
He'd like to put you to the test
A soul like his will never rest
Beware my love
Beware my love
Ooh
He'll ask you why don't you climb on in
If you do you won't be back again
Beware my love
Beware my love
First thing you notice are his eyes
So clear and cold promise you the skies
Beware my love
Beware my love
Should the sun find you today
Better fall down on your knees and pray
Beware my love, beware my love
First thing you notice are his eyes
So clear and cold, promise you the skies
Beware my love, beware my love
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Should the sun find you today
Get down on your knees and pray
Beware my love
Beware my love
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
