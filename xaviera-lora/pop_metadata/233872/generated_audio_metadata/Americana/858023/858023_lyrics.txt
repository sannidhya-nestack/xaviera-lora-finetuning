America, I miss you
But in my dreams you're still alive
A place that I believed in
That honored truth instead of lies
A place where every man, woman, and child had worth
A place where people valued the beauty of the earth
I can see you in my mind
I didn't ever want to part
I remember with tears of joy
And your passing breaks my heart
Oh America I love
America, it's hard to let you go
America, I still hold you dear
America, don't give in to fear
America, I miss you, how you once stood so strong
For decency, democracy, for right over wrong
A place where freedom rang from every hill and peak
A place that honored dignity and lifted up the weak
I can see you in my mind
I didn't ever want to part
I remember with tears of joy
And your passing breaks my heart
Oh America I love
America, it's hard to let you go
America, I still hold you dear
America, don't give in to fear
We've seen mighty kingdoms come and go
Empires rise and fall
But America stood proudly for the rights of all
I can see you
In my mind
I didn't ever want to part
I remember with tears of joy
And your passing breaks my heart
Oh America, I love
America, it's hard to let you go
America, I still hold you dear
America, don't give in to fear
