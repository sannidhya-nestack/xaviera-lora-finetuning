I don't believe in nothing
Take it away
I don't even hear a word you're saying
Why you stopped smiling at me
Sweet little babe
When are you leaving me today?
And I'll hang around with my head in the clouds
Waiting for a way to face tomorrow
Sweet little babe
Where will I find you at tomorrow
Time slips away
Surely the mind is fit to follow
Oh and I'll wear your crown
Till the sun sets you down
Maybe we can find a way to win
Oh and I'll hang around
With my head by your mouth
I can hear every word that you are saying
By the way
Who can say what'll happen tomorrow
Oh I'm always around
With my head in the clouds
Waiting for a way to face tomorrow
And I'll wear you down with my hands and my mouth
Fate is just a place to hide your sorrow
