Greed gave way to a dying need as he woke up on the run
He shook the snake from his worn out boot and the frost off his gun
Headed down to Ketchikan town
Setting up for a medicine show
He'll sell Lydia Pink, a snake oil drink
His pretty bottles all in a row
He's even got Fontaine's Balm of a thousand flowers
It will cure all your pain
It might even bring some rain in
Some have swore it gave them supernatural powers
Take a spoonful to calm your fears
To open up your mind and wash it clear
You will mend a broken heart and dry your tears
There seems to be a lot more of those falling down'round here
Elbow to elbow, move in ear to ear
Put the short in the front and the tall in the rear
It will cure your disease and the ache in your knee
I have in this bottle the magical key
The potions that he sold them
Settle deep into their brain
It kept the skin from crawling
But it only grazed the pain
So they take another swallow of their deluded lives
Never noticing the dying ghosts trapped behind their hollow eyes
One more spoonful to disappear
Two more to drown the cries and lies of the insincere
Escape into the drop of a falling tear
There seems to be a lot more of them falling down round here
They gather round this simple town
And they trust in what the label says
Ooh, if you dare get yourself some balm of a thousand flowers
Come on down, gather round, don't pay attention to the sound
When they cry out loud
One last spoonful to disappear
To drown the cries and lies of the insincere
Escape into the drop of a falling tear
There seems to be a lot more of them falling round down here
There seems to be a lot more of them falling round here
I see a lot more of us falling down'round here
Just open wide and take it down
Take one for yourself and pass it around
Watch the horizon say goodbye to the sun
Close your eyes this day is done
