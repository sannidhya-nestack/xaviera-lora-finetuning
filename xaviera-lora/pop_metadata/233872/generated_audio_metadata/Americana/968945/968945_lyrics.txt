Well, the break of dawn did crack the sky
Some old wounds can't open in the night
And it looked like thunder, it looked like rain
You'll see me walking down that road again
Well, my troubles got me on the run
And if they don't catch me I'm a lucky son of a gun
Gold and silver shine like the sun
Shine on me I'm a lucky son of a gun
Well, a rich man, poor man, beggar, thief
Standing proud on your knees
There are some who love you and some who hurt
Got my head in the clouds and my feet are stuck in the dirt
Yeah, my troubles got me on the run
But if they don't catch me, I'm a lucky son of a gun
Gold and silver, shining like the sun
Shine on me, I'm a lucky son of a gun
Oh my troubles got no end
Got no money, I ain't got no friends
I got trouble sleeping, worn out my shoes
But I'll keep one step ahead of my blues
Well my troubles got me on the run
And if they don't catch me I'm a lucky son of a gun
Gold and silver shining like the sun
Shine on me I'm a lucky sun
Yeah a lucky sun
