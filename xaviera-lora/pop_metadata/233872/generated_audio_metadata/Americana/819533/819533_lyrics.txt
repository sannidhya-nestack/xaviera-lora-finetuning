Mrs. Iskrig, I am writing you from Washington, D .C.
I have journeyed to this cold black wall
There's someone I had to see
His memory broke over me just like the pouring rain
When I reached up and touched your Danny's name
Well the war was never popular
But no war's meant to be
And I know that Dan dreamed someday
Maybe all men could be free
I prayed that God did not allow your son to die in vain
When I reached up and touched your Danny's name
So many lives
So many dreams carved in that cold black stone
So many men
So many boys dying to come back home
But I guess it's time to say goodbye
And head on toward the sun
And I hope that in your heart of hearts
Some healing has begun
I only wanted you to know
I'll never be the same
Since I reached up and touched your Danny's name
Since I reached up and touched your Danny's name
