Step back into the blinding sunlight
I've been running for days, running day and night
I try to change my hair, my clothes, my name
After all this time it remains the same
Now, but if you don't care where you're headed
You could have a train
Rolling like a stone in the night
Feeling less than sane
Outrunning my demons left and right
Keep going'til you see the morning light
Until you reach mountains and streams of name
After all this time this girl can never be tamed
Not if you don't care where you're headed
You could have her take
Rolling like a stone in the night
Feeling less than sane
Cry me out back in the blindin' morning light
There'll be no more runnin' after tonight
So tell my story, say my name
I'll be spendin' the rest of my life in jail
