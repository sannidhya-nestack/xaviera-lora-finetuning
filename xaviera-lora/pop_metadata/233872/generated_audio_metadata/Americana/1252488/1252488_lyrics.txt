I have climbed the highest mountain
Some made from rock and stone
I have sailed the longest rivers
And I have never been alone
As I rise from this childhood
And I see all that I own
Well there ain't no place that I'm coming from
Can satisfy my soul
From the fire to the stove
Oh, I'm gonna satisfy my soul
From the ancients to the old
Oh, I'm gonna satisfy my soul
I have seen the rising spirit on the wings that eagles fly
I have felt its high, its no show with the rhythm by my side
And I have seen and found distinction in the messages I've owed
As they cry a thousand more tears as their running blood turns cold
From the fire to the stove
All I want to satisfy my soul
From the ancients to the old
All I want to satisfy my soul
From the fire to the stove
All I want to satisfy my soul
From the ancients to the old
All I want to satisfy my soul
Satisfy my soul, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Satisfy my soul
I have walked with ancient people
Through sea and sky and sand
I have heard their solemn voices
As they cry upon sacred land
As I rise from this childhood
And I see all that I own
Well there ain't no place that I'm a coming from
Can't satisfy my soul
From the fire to the stove
Oh, I wanna satisfy my soul
From the ancients to the old
Gonna satisfy my soul
From the fire to the stove
Gonna satisfy my soul
From the ancients to the old
Gonna satisfy my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul
Like to satisfy my soul
Not satisfied my soul, satisfied my soul, satisfied my soul, satisfied my soul, satisfied my soul
