Imagine life without a home
Or a country to call your own
Thank God for those who gave their lives to make this the home of the brave
Hey, come live the American dream
Set yourself free and fight for your beliefs
Place your hand on your heart
And shed a tear for Mother USA today
The years gone by, we're far away
Give us all we have today
Brave souls who mark their graves
Cry out so you can hear them say
Hey, come live the American dream
Set yourself free and fight for your beliefs
Place your hand on your heart and shed a tear
Oh Mother USA hey hey today
Remember that September day
The sun shined down while our children played
The sky was clear when the planes came down
Clouds of smoke rose from the ground
We watched in disbelief and cried
When thousands of our brothers died
The evil won't around that day
They can't take our pride away
New day dawns and hope abounds
Find it there from town to town
We paid the price for freedom's sake
And we'll rise to show the world we'll still lead the way
Hey, come live the American dream
Set yourself free and fight for your beliefs
Place your hand on your heart
And shed a tear for Mother USA today
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
