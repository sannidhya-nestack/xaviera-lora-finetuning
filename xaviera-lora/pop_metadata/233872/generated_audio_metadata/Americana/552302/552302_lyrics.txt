Monday comes and I wonder where you are
The phone is quiet there's no sign of your call
Is something wrong or are you taking a break
When silence rules my heart begins to ache
Sometimes sleep don't come easy
Your face keeps rolling through my mind
I toss and turn and imagine the worst
My head should know you're more than likely fine
But sometimes sleep don't come easy
Two days later you knock on my door
Say you missed me but I'm never sure
And all seems well there was no reason to fret
But something tells me your eyes are still wet
Sometimes sleep don't come easy
Your face keeps rolling through my mind
I toss and turn and imagine the worst
My head should know you're more than likely fine
But sometimes sleep don't come easy
And Friday evening we're out there again
Having drinks and meeting all our friends
Music's loud and the whiskey is strong
Smile on your face, I guess I was wrong
Sometimes sleep don't come easy
Your face keeps rolling through my mind
I toss and turn and imagine the worst
My head should know you're more than likely fine
But sometimes sweet don't come easy
But sometimes sleep don't come easy
Yeah sometimes sleep don't come easy
