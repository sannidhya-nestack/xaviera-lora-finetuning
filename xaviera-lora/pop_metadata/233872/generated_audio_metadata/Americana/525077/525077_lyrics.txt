It's three fifteen in the morning
And the train is right on time
I can hear that whistle blow
five miles down the line
My baby said she'd be here
One oh five, don't fret
She said that it was over with him
On the day we met
Train, train
Take me out of here
Train, train
Take me out of here
Love is just a game, oh, so they say
Win, lose or draw, there's a price to pay
Timing ends so many things
Come into play
The only thing on time this time
Is that train today, yeah
Train, train
Take me out of here
Train, train, take me outta here
Train, train, take me outta here
Train, train, take me out of here
