Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oompah-pah, do-do-do, oompah-pah
Do-do-do, oompah-pap
Do-do-do, do-do
Well, you left me baby, you made it clear
You said you didn't want me here
You sent me on my way in the pouring rain
Now I've lost my way out on the astral plane
Now I've lost my way out on the astral plane
So many years that you were mine
I had to walk that narrow line
It's a line between love and hate I know
It was your idea so I had to let you go
I got a soul that'll never stop living
I got a heart that'll never stop giving
This sounds like a plan from a man who's gone insane
So look for me baby out on the astral plane
Mmm bop bop, do do do, do do, mmm bop bop
Do do do, do do, do do, mmm bop brop, do do do, do do
If you change your mind, you want me near
Now if you look around and I'm not here
Then you know I've gone but I hear you call my name
You can find me baby out on the astral plane
Now I got a soul that'll never stop living
I got a heart that'll never stop giving
It sounds like a plan from a man who's gone insane
Now I got a soul that'll never stop living
I got a heart that'll never stop giving
It sounds like a plan from a man who's gone insane
So look for me baby out on the astral plane
So look for me baby out on the astral plane
