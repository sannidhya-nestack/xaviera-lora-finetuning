I hope it's you,'cause I loved you from the very start
I hope it's you, and I love the way you fight from the heart
I hope it's you,'cause I still turn my head when you're walking by
I hope it's you, and I'll need you'til the end of time
I hope it's you
I hope it's you
I hope it's you
I hope it's you, I hope it's you now, hey, hey, so, so
I hope it's you,'cause I love the magic when we talk
I hope it's you, and I love the way you're bad after dark
I hope it's you,'cause I dislike the way you light up my life
I hope it's you, and I love the way you show me your mind
I hope it's you
I hope it's you
I hope it's you
I hope it's you, I hope it's you now
I hope it's you, I hope it's you
I hope it's you, I hope it's you
I hope it's you,'cause I loved you from the very start
I hope it's you, and I love the way you fight from the heart
I hope it's you,'cause I still turn my head when you're walking by
I hope it's you, and I'll need you'til the end of time
I hope it's you, I hope it's you
I hope it's you
I hope it's you, I hope it's you now
I hope it's you
I hope it's you
I hope it's you
I hope it's you
I hope it's you
I hope it's you
