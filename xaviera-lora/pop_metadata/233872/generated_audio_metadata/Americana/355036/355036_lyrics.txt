Well I sat down last Sunday morning and I turned on my old TV
I saw the preacher he was saying that he could make a blind man see
And then he looked
And to the camera he said I'll heal the sick and lame
If you'll just send me twenty dollars I'll make you well in Jesus name
And then he went on and started screaming about the sins of rock and roll
He said to burn all of your records before you start to lose control
And then he said that country music is just as bad, Lord, and just as wrong
You'll go to hell
You'll burn with Satan if you keep listening to those songs
And he don't play no country music
And he don't like to rock and roll
Yes, he's the only human being with a sound
And I don't claim to be no saint now
But there's one thing that I know for sure
That it just ain't right to make no profit off the law
And we grew up with all our heroes
They made us feel so good inside
It might be Elvis or the Beatles
Or O'Hank Williams jammed the line
And I don't like to see no con man
Or take advantage of the weak
He's trying to find himself a scapegoat
To pave his way to easy street
And he don't play no country music
And he don't like to rock and roll
Yes, he's the only human being
We're the sanitarist soul
And I don't claim to be no saint now
But there's one thing that I know for sure
And it just ain't right to make no profit off the law
Well, this ain't right, it just ain't right
Well, look, this ain't right now, well, look, this ain't right
It just ain't right to make no profit off the law
Oh no, it just ain't right, it just ain't right, it just ain' right now, it just ain't right, it just ain "t right to make no profit off the Lord
