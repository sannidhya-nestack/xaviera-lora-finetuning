Hangin' out east of Baton Rouge at a place called the End of the Line
Gettin' stuffed on seafood gumbo, snuggled up with a jug of wine
Barkeep said the lead singer got drunk and he just fell off the stage
And as soon as they could find a replacement, they had more music on the way
I said, "Buddy, you're lookin' at a bluesman who's a little down on his luck"
And if you could see fit, I could sure use a gig
Maybe just enough to fill my truck
You said, "Go on out and get your guitar, son"
But I'm telling you here and now
That you better be able to play that thing
you're playing for a coon-ass crowd
End of the line, right at the end of the line
It was a one night stand for a one man band
We had nothing but time
End of the line, out at the end of the line
I was playing that music that they wanna hear
Out at the end of the line
We done started getting lots of musicians
Dale, Bridget, CJ and Mahmood
They all stop by to do a little sitting in every night or two
First time the police come right through the door
Well I thought they'd shut us down
But they just come to do a little bit of dancing
And they rocked the whole damn town
End of the line, out at the end of the line
No more one night stands for this six piece band
Our name's up there on the sun and
End of the line, out at the end of the line
We're just playing that music that they wanna hear
Out at the end of the line
End of the line, out at the end of the line
No more one night stands, we're a six piece band
Our names up there on the sign
End of the line, out at the end of the line
We're just playing that music that they wanna hear
Out at the end of the line
We're playing that music that they wanna hear
Out at the end of the line
