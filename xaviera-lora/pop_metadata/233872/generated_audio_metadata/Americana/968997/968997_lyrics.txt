I got a black-eyed dog and sorrow is his name
Hear him howling in the cold rain
Yes, a howl that tells me my soul is lost
I gotta carry that heavy cross
And I know I'll stand my ground
As the sorrow dogs they hunt me down
Oh, I'll stand my ground as the sorrow dogs
They hunt me down, hunt me down
I got a black-eyed dog and sorrow is his name
I hear him howlin' in the cold rain
It's a howl that tell me my soul is lost
And I gotta carry that heavy cross
And I know, I'll stand my ground
As the sorrow dogs, they hunt me down
Oh, I'll stand my ground
As the sorrow dogs, they hunt me down
Hunt me down
Hold me down
Hunt me down in the morning when the sorrow dog come calling
Hunt me down in the evening when the sorrow dog come creeping
Hunt me down in the shadows where the sorrow dog is hiding
Hunt me down in the morning when the sorrow dog come calling me
And I know I'll stand my ground as the sorrow dies
They hold me down
Oh, I'll stand my ground as the side road dogs, they hunt me down
Oh, I'll stand my ground as the side roads dogs, they hunt me down
Oh, I'll stand my ground as a sorrow dove
They hunt me down (oh, oh, oh)
Hunt me down
