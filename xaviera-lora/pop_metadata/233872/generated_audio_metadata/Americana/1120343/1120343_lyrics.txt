If you lock me up, I'm gonna break on out
And if you tear me up, I'm gonna come on down
Don't you bring that stuff, go ahead and take it out
And if the going's too tough, I wanna hear you shout
nobody told you, told you, told you it would be easy
You've just gotta believe me
If you test my heart
You're gonna get results
And if you push too far
You're gonna feel the volts
And if you talk too much
It's gonna bite you back
You better watch your touch
I just might react
nobody told you, told you, told you it would be easy
You've just gotta believe me
You've just gotta believe me
You got a chance right now
If you wanna explain
nobody told you, told you, told you it would be easy
You just gotta believe me
You just gotta believe me
You just gotta believe me
