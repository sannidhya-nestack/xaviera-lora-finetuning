But that's the way that I've been heading home
Keep crossing over railroad tracks
Just trying to shake that monkey from my back
Through howling winds and
Driving the rain to be in your arms again
Keep on crossing over railroad tracks
Just trying to find my way back
Kicking dust up as I walk that road
Just trying to find my way back home
I can't hear the angels sing so sweetly
Under the blood red sky of the setting sun
You can show me truth with a slighter hand
I won't try too hard to understand
et my sorrows and all my pain
When I'm in your arms again
Keep on crossing over railroad tracks
Just trying to find my way back
Kicking dust up as I walk that road
Just trying to find
Oh, my way home
I'll keep on crossing over railroad tracks
Well, I'm just trying to find
On my way back
I'm kicking dust up as I walk that road
Just trying to find
My way back home
Yeah, my way back home
Yeah, I'm gonna find
On my way back home
Yeah I'm gonna find
Well my way back home
