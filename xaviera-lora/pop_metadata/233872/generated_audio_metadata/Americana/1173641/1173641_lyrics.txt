I was staring out the window wondering just what I could say
If I had to justify to some of my old buddies why I live this way
All of a sudden it just hit me right between the eyes
I couldn't tell nobody else, nobody in the world but me, myself and I
The first job I had was perfect
My first girlfriend she was too
But there just seemed to be some little something
Keeping me from being true
So I got out on the highway
Texas sun up in the sky
I couldn't blame nobody else
Nobody in the world but me myself and I
Everything in moderation
Nothing to accept
Man, if it wasn't worth overdoing
Then it failed my test
Lives a mess of contradictions
I wouldn't tell no lies
Not to any one of you
Just to me, myself and I
I let experience be my teacher
Just my conscience was my guide
And the hell I was fleeing
The love I was seeking
They were both inside
Seen the future and it scared me
Said a prayer on me own mind
I couldn't save nobody else
Nobody in the world
But me, myself and I
So me, myself and I, we all recommend
To you and you and you, just be your own best friend
It ain't over'til it's over, what goes around comes around
And while we're on that subject, what goes up's surely gonna come back down
I couldn't save nobody else, nobody in this world but me, myself and I
