You're just like her, though you don't know it
You need a drug, you're gonna blow it
You need your fix, you need your fire
Your Jones and Fowler takes you higher
Who is this bitch, this harlot whore
How dare she steal my friend and more
ive my sting, she's not my gripe
I'm mad at you, the time is ripe
For you to hear some real ass talk
You're in a haze, you're in shel-shar
You're just like her, though you don't know it
Need a drug, you're gonna blow it
Need your fix, you need your fire
Jones and Ford takes you higher
Now I don't mean hard drugs or smack, you're trying to find all that you lack
And other people and tricky women in me and drink and fancy living
And when this happens you disappear, you're gone again, just what I feared
And I'm bereft, I lost my friend all because you're lost again
You're just like her, though you don't know it
Need a drug, you're gonna blow it
Need your fix, you need your fire
Jones and Farr takes you higher
You have to wait and sit with pain, you must be strong and weathering
First you must fill yourself up with love and care, all that good stuff
And then maybe a girl will come your current state
You're just like her though you don't know it
Need a drug you're gonna blow it
Need your fix you need your fire
Jones and fire takes you higher
Just like her though you don't know it
Need a drug you're gonna blow it
Need your fix you need your fire
Jones and fire what takes you higher
Higher, Higher, Higher, Higher, Higher, Higher, Higher, Higher, Higher, Higher, Higher, Higher
