Last night I had another dream while the moon sat to my right
So many people died in some idealistic fight
You know there ain't no place that's safe no more there ain't no hell's remote
Our boring time on this old world is a sorbenturo
I walk through shattered buildings of a used-to-be proud city
I step through hate and fear so deep it almost buried me
While I wondered the entire time what could we all be thinking
To create a perfect hell on earth with the fire and blood we're drinking
Why can't we dream with naked eyes
I know this comes as no surprise
Why can't you feel within your heart
Don't you know we will tear this world apart
Don't it come as no surprise
Every week a movie breaks, the plot is old, it's weak and tired
I watch them every single one, I'm interested, why yet?
Why oh why oh why, comes as no surprise?
Why's Alma getting so interested nearly every single time?
Why oh why oh why comes as no surprise
To watch some soldiers mad with hate engage in sadist cry
Why oh why oh why comes as no surprise
Why can't we dream with naked eyes
I know this comes as no surprise
Why can't you feel it in your heart?
Don't you know you will tear this world apart?
And it doesn't come as no surprise
We've heard the songs and we've read the book so many many times
Why oh why oh why comes as no surprise
Telling us how life is dying and how we are now in decline
Why oh why oh why comes as no surprise
Well I guess our time on earth is waning fading as we're speaking
Why oh why oh why comes as no surprise
We'll litter up the universe with the people and machines
Why oh why oh why comes as no surprise
This ain't no lie this stuff comes boiling right up from my heart
Why, oh why, oh why, comes as no surprise?
Oh, it had been too many times that we tore this world apart
Why, oh why, oh why, comes as no surprise?
We will host some newer travelers to launch the colonizing
Why, oh why, oh why, comes as no surprise?
You know I welcome that since humanity is the perfect fertilizer
Why, oh why, oh why, comes as no surprise?
