Hey baby what you gonna do
You never stopped to think things through
Scratch that itch if you only knew
Trouble sticks around like a bad tattoo
Ba ba ba da ba ba
Ba ba ba da ba
Ba da ba ba ba
Ba ba ba da ba
Oh boy, you made a mess
But you can't undo what you can't confess
And you're swearing up and down it isn't true
You went sneaking round that corner
Dirty money in your hand
Messed around with the dealer's daughter
But nothing went exactly as you planned
Ain't that always true now?
Ba ba ba da ba ba
Ba ba ba da ba
Ba da ba ba da
Ba da ba da ba
Hey babe, you should have known
Your cover someday would be blown
Now the "ba ba ba da ba" has hit the fan
You know it's nothing new
The past just catches up with you
And you're running for your life as fast as you can
You went sneaking'round that corner
You went creeping down the stairs
Thought you'd make out like Jack Horner
But the calm you pull has vanished in thin air
Ain't that always true now?
Ba ba ba da ba ba
Ba ba ba da ba
Ba da ba ba ba da
Ba ba ba da ba
Ba ba ba da ba
Ba da ba ba ba
Ba da ba
Ba da ba ba
Ba da ba da ba
Hey baby, what you gonna do?
You never stopped to think things through
Scratch that itch if you only knew
Trouble sticks around like a bad tattoo
Bad tattoo, bad bad bad, ooh, ooh
Bad tattoo
