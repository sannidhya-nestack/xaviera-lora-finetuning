Wake up to another day
There was a time I did not feel my age
Oh, but I feel it now
Pop two pills and send'em down
I'm like an aging boxer facing his last round
They wanna knock me out
Reminiscing on the past just seems like a waste
When I can count the memories by the lines on my face
Time will never let me go
Time won't let me go now
Time will never set me free
Keep stickin' it just keeps stickin'
Time ain't gonna be my friend
It's not gonna be my friend'cause
Time's catchin' up to me
Father time has got my keys
And I'm ridin' shotgun straight on down the line
We never stop for gas
Everything I pass in life
It just brings me closer to the end of mine
Man it's going fast
We do the same things every day and lose who we are
And now the world remaining doesn't seem very far
Time won't ever let me go
Time won't let me go
Time won't ever set me free
It keeps ticking, it just keeps ticking
Time ain't gonna be my friend
It's not gonna be my friend'cause
Time's catching up to me
Driving'til the wheels fall off
I'll call it quits and kick back with a smile
I got no regrets
I wouldn't change it if I could
I know I can't so dreaming does no good
I guess I made my bed
When I look back upon my life I'm somewhat impressed
But wasting all my promises is what I did best
Time will never let me go (time won't let me go)
Time will never set me free (it keeps ticking, it just keeps ticking)
Time ain't gonna be my friend (it's not gonna be my friend)
time's catching up to me
