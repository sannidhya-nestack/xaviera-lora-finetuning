There's a light that shines over the tears
It's a whole new way of life
There's a bed of joy for you and me
we're fighting to survive
Oh, won't you take me down there
People say this is the promised land
Every dream will be fulfilled
And they say that life is sweet as pie
No more tasting bitter pills
Oh, won't you take me down there
I say, oh, would you take me down there?
Diamonds and pearls, I'll be your girl
In a brave new world, we'll find diamonds and pearls
And I'll be your girl
In a brave new world
People say the streets are paved with gold
Instead of broken bottle glass
There has got to be some joy in hope
'Cause my life is fading fast
Oh, won't you take me down there
I said oh, please take me down there
Down there
Diamonds and pearls
I'll be your girl
In the brave new world
We'll find diamonds and pearls
And I'll be your girl, yeah
In the brave new world
We'll find diamonds and pearls
And I'll be your girl
In a brave new world
We'll find diamonds and pearls
And a real world
In a brave new world
In a brave new world
Oh, it's a brave new world
It's a brave new world
