You've got to move, you've got to move
You've got to move child, you've got to
Be with Lord, get ready, you've got to
Y'all gotta move
Sometimes I'm up
Sometimes I'm down
Sometimes I'm too close
So they ground
It went low, yeah
They're ready
Y'all got time
Move in city police upon the street
And say they lie out on the beach
You were lying, get ready, you got time
You gotta move, you gotta move, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta move, you gotta, you gotta gotcha gotcha gotcha gotcha gotcha gotcha move ya
You gotta move, you gotta move, you gotta move
You gotta, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Move, you gotta move
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta, gotta, gotta, you gotta move
You gotta move
You gotta move, you gotta move, you gotta move
You may be high, you may be low
You may be rich child, you may be poor
But when the Lord Him get ready
You got time, you got time
You got to move, you got to move
You got to move child, you got to
You and Lloyd, get ready
You got to move
