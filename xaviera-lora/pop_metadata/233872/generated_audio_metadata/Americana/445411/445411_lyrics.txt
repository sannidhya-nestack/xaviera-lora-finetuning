A young'un said, "Mama, where did I come from?"
The stars in the sky say life's only begun
Give me a line on how to be someone
A young'un said, "Mama, where did I come from?"
You're family made
Family made
Out of love
Family made
Family made
Family made
Guaranteed for life
Family made
A young'un said, "Mama, where does money come from?"
The birds and the bees don't ever need none
They fly and sing and look like they have fun
I yawned and said, "Mama, where does money come from?"
It's family made, family made
We all work hard, family made
Family made, family made
Guaranteed for life, family made
A young'un said, "Mama, where does love come from?"
A kid at school was shot with a handgun
The lady on the news said hate was the problem
A young'un said, "Mama, where does love come from?"
It's family made, family made from above
Family made, family made, family made
Guaranteed for life, family made
When I see little trouble in the world today
I thank the Lord I was family made
I'm family made, family made
Out of love, family made
Family made
Family made
Guaranteed for life
Family made
We're family made
Family made
Out of love
Family made
Family made
Family made, guaranteed for life
Family made, we're family made
