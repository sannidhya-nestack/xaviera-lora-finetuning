These colors don't run
These colors hold fast
This symbol that waves
Over a free land
Our emblem blood red
White and blue
Shining with stars
That stand for me and you
Well our adversaries run her down
And burn her in vain
The freedom bought with blood
Still runs through our veins
Always the same
these colors don't run
They cross swords and fight
These colors don't die
They prevail through the night
This banner don't fade
Raise it up high
Or the home of the brave
Where the Eagles fly
Standing at the zero ground where so many fell
Keeping a lonely vigil determined to prevail
these colors don't run
These colors hold fast
This symbol that waits
Over a free land
Our emblem blood red
White and blue
Shining with stars
That stand for me and you
Shining with stars
That stand for me and you
