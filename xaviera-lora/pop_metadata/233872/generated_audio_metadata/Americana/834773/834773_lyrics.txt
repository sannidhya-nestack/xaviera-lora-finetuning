Oh when the ghost of Louisiana
Moves with grace over Bourbon Street
Through the summer heat
Smell the Cajun food
As she dances to the Mississippi Delta Blues
To the Mississippi Delta Blues
To the Mississippi Delta Blues
And as if on cue
She drifts to the bayou
Where Pagan witches make their brew
Steams like a sauna with New Orleans drama
Down in the French Quarter
Oh down near the French Quarter
Dancing to the Mississippi Delta Blues
And as the night becomes a blanket
And the witches prepare a banquet
Those dancing shadows in the dark
Can only be the ghosts of Louisiana
And everyone will know that, yeah
Everyone will know that
This dancing is more than show
Oh, and the ghost of Louisiana
Moves with grace over Bourbon Street
Through the summer heat
Smell the page unfolding
As she dances to the Mississippi Delta Blues
To the Mississippi Delta Blues
To the Mississippi Delta Blues
The Mississippi Delta Blues
