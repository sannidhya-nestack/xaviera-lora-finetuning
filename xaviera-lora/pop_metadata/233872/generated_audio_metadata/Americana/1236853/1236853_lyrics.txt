They say I am too sensitive
And my thoughts are too deep
Maybe they are insensitive
Or walking through life half asleep
Unaware and afraid to feel
We see through a glass darkly
Perhaps they can't see what I see
Our great friends of honesty
Living in blindness, what's for them?
Some can be so quick to condemn
It makes me want to scream
We see through a blast
When I push the boundaries of my mind
I might have to walk all alone
Truth may not always be so kind
But I can call my life my home
Refusing to see through a glass darkly
The more I seek to understand
The less they are understanding
Time is slipping through my hands
Distance between us is expanding
Living in blindness continues on
Some see through a glass, darkly
When I push the boundaries of my mind
I might have to walk all alone
Truth may not always be so kind
But I can't call my life my own
Refusing to see through a glass, darkly
Some see through a glass darkly
But I refuse to see through a glass darkly
Some see through a glass darkly
No one has to see through a glass darkly
