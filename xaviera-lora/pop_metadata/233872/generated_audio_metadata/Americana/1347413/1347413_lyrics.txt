Heard your songs out in my car
Guess they had a nice guitar
But now I think it's time you leave me, babe
Can't make it work but still I see
You ain't been no fool to me
Take good care, don't be so hard broke or so ashamed
Was it easy to believe me when I said
You are such a beautiful man who's done nothing but love and care for me
And now I know it seems unfair
But every gap's a showing here
And now it's you that simply cannot be
Many tears are falling bare
Many nights gone quiet here
You done nothing but love and care for me
Now your heart's inside a bee's nest
Your hurt burned every bridge
Why you'd guess that I'm still
Gone like John, anyway and anyway
What a special touch when I caught the eye of
Some stupid passer-by
While you told me how you'd waited half the day
You'd wait forever for a reason that ain't there
Many tears have fallen there
Many nights felt quiet here
You've done nothing but love and care
I felt the world shut vacuum straight
While my ass flew out the gates
Till you done nothing but love and care for me
Stop never did I understand
Why I thought I loved that man
But now I get it plain as sand that I just
You said it was your worst mistake
Loving someone who drops a heart just to break it
In a prison special made for fools like me
Still no hate, no hurt or shame
Still gone like John and I just don't care
I'm still gone anyway, anyway
