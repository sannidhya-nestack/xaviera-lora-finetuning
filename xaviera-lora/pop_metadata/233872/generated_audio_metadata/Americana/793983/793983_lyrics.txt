I lost my patience, I lost my pride
I lost my money when I let a bad ride, ride, ride
I lost my passion'cause I took it in stride
When I lost your love, I might as well have died
I want to get back that feeling like we had
Since it's been gone, oh I need it bad, so bad
I want to get back that gift of indescribable bliss
That's one feeling I surely have missed
Some folks will tell you I've lost my mind
But when they say that, just being kind to kind
I lost my senses, I waved them goodbye
But there's one thing I know I cannot be denied
I want to get back that feeling like we had
Since it's been gone
Oh, I need it bad, so bad
I want to get back that gift of indescribable bliss
That's one feeling I surely have missed
You're easy to love but you're hard to like
And you won't even consider my plight
But I'm not trying to pick a fight
I just want to rekindle the light of love
I want to get back that feeling like we had
Since it's been gone
Oh, I need it bad, so bad
I want to get back
That gift of indescribable bliss
That's one feeling I surely have missed
Yeah, that's one feeling I surely have missed
