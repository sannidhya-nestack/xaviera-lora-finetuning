Gotta walk tall, don't look back
Like a railroad train down a one-way track
Just keep smiling like nothing's wrong
Keep on singing that same old song
The trails narrow, the cold wind whips your face
Pray a bit, hope to find some grace
And strength to keep on moving straight ahead
On that rock and gravel trail inside your head
Ooh, it's a hard way to go
And I ain't telling you nothing
You don't already know
It's a real dark night
Let the fire inside you rage
Just like good whiskey
It all gets better with age
Turning back is a choice you dare not make
What does it mean for heaven's sake
Rolling like an engine beating time
Finding a way to make things right
Truth is it's a long old winding road
No reason to complain about the load
This trail leads along a narrow path
Won't slip and you'll reap the aftermath
Ooh, it's a hard way to go
And I ain't telling you nothing
You don't already know
It's a real dark night
Let the fire inside me rage
Oh, just like good whiskey
It all gets better with age
