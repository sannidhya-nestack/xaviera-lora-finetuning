News that ain't abuse is getting scarcer
I'm just a kind and susceptible guy whose ears can't stand to be hearing
About rape and murder every day of my life (No good news, no good news)
Christ, don't let folks news hear you say
I think I'll take out the wire
Ain't been no good news now since I can remember (No good news, no good news)
Even the funny papers ain't a-havin' no fun (no fun, it's no fun, it's no fun, it's no fun)
I can't no more bet about that awful fake on the 11th of September
Baby, pack your bags, we are moving to a news-free zone
Car wrecks, train wrecks, and no good suspects
And don't et all the planes
There's everybody talkin', the heads are all talkin'
They keep talkin' all over again (now goodness)
I can't abide gettin' that kind of job in my home (now goodness)
Oh baby pack your bags we are movin' to a news free zone
No good news, no good news
No good news, no good news
No good news, no good news
So don't call me and ramble on about that pipeline tonight (no good news)
When they killed the wrong man on the TV and let them go (No good news, no good news)
But who is giving who now and that's psycho motivation
What the hell is going on in our nation
Baby pack your bags we are moving to a news free zone (No good news, no good news)
Honey pack your bags we're moving to a news free zone (No good news, no good news)
I don't wanna know, I'm moving to the new street zone
