I got a little ant crawling up my knee
Oh, quit buggin' me
I think he's starting up an ant colony
Oh, quit buggin' me
He's gonna bring in his whole family
Oh, quit buggin' me
He's building a house with six balconies
Oh, quit buggin' me
Quit buggin' me
Can't you just let me be
Yeah, quit buggin' me
Why don't you get up and leave
I got a big brother always pickin' on me (oh, quit buggin' me)
He's teasing me almost constantly (oh, quit buggin' me)
He gets me in trouble with authority (oh, quit buggin' me)
He's a branch I cut off off our family tree (oh, quit buggin' me)
Quit buggin' me, can't you just let me be?
Yeah, quit buggin' me, why don't you get up and leave?
Sometimes it seems they're all against me
Can't they leave me alone and go peacefully
When I get older when I'm not so small
They're gonna be sour gonna bug them all
I've got a bad case of poison ivy (oh, quit buggin' me)
I'm scratchin' every part of my anatomy (oh, quit buggin' me)
Now no one's to blame except for maybe me (oh, quit buggin' me)
I'm buggin' myself, itchin' crazily (oh, quit buggin' me)
Quit buggin' me
Can't you just let me be? Yeah, quit buggin' me
Why don't you get up and leave
Yeah, quit buggin' me
Can't you just let me be
Yeah, quit buggin' me
Why don't you get up and leave
Quit buggin' me
Quit buggin', buggin', buggin' me
Oh, quit buggin' me
Quit buggin' me
Oh, quit buggin' me
Quit buggin' me
Oh, quit buggin' me
Quit buggin', buggin', buggin', buggin'
Oh, quit buggin' me
