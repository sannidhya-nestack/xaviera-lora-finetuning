Grandfather fiddled Canadian herd down
St. Anne's Reap, fly bird mill
It's all like the devil till the morning
To see the dance floor fill and the ladies swoon
When I was young, home in Louisiana
I couldn't sleep, fiddle singing in my dreams
Folks all heard my fiddle when I grew up
To carry on the tunes my Pepe played
Grandfather's fiddle sings of him when I play fast
And she cries when I play slow
When they go, the not otten road
Anytime grandfather's fiddle gets struck by the bow
Grandfather's gone but not otten
He lives on in his fiddle and bow
Our kids will know where they come from
When I play a little fiddle and call out "Dancy Doe"
Oh don't you know
Grandfather's fiddle sings to him when I play it back
And she cries when I play it slow
When they go and I've otten to know
Anytime Grandfather's fiddle gets too far to go
And father said who is a good fiddlin' son
Learn the tunes your pappy plays
All the songs we've all learned after we are gone
The tunes of the fiddle they live to another day
Grandfather's fiddle sings of him when I play fast
And she cries when I play the slow
When they go they're not otten, no
Anytime grandfather's fatal, get stroked by the bow
Grandfathered music lives on through my soul
