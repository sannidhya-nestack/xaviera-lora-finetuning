I used to cry all night long
But that was before you came along
I used to go down'til someone cried foul
That was my life, that was then, this is now
I used to lie when I opened my mouth
You turned me around and made the truth come out
I used to fall down but you caught me somehow
That was my life, that was then, this is now
Long before you came into my life
Every day was filled with struggle and strife
We used to fight like cats and dogs
Chomping at the bit, nipping at my heels all day long
I used to go down'til someone cried foul
That was my life, that was then, this is now
I'm having the time of my life and I don't ever want it to end
So keep the wheels turning so we can go on and on and on
I used to cry all night long
That was before you came along
I used to go down'til someone cried wow
That was my life, that was then, this is now
That was my life, that was then, this is now
That was my life, that was then, this is now
