What you gonna do when the deal goes down, boy?
Who you gonna take your troubles to?
What you gonna do when the deal goes down, boy?
When the only one to blame is you
Everybody knows that life's a gamble
Some you win and some you have to lose
This time you took on more than you can handle
Bit off a little more than you can chew
Everybody knows that life's against you
Time was never ever on your side
When things don't turn out how they're meant to
It's time to take the midnight train and ride
Be sure to write a letter to your mother
Tell her that you won't be home no more
Be sure to tell her that you love her
And someday you'll meet on that distant shore
What you gonna do when the deal goes down, boy
Who you gonna take your troubles to?
What you gonna do when the deal goes down, boy
When the only one to blame is you
When the deal goes down, what you gonna do?
