Last time I fell in love
I felt like a shooting star
Only to burn out like a spark in the wind
As my heart went up in smoke
I swore that's all she wrote
I'd never fall again
So I flew straight as an arrow
I walked the straight and narrow
I slipped and took a trip down lover's lane
I've got that sinking feeling
You've got me reeling
I'm falling like I never thought I could
My head is in a tailspin
My heart just took a tumble
It's time I stumbled onto something good
Your love knocked me for a loop
And now I've come full circle
I'm flying high with both feet on the ground
Though I swore I'd never fall
I was mistaken after all
I'm on my way back down
I've got that second feeling
You've got me reeling
I'm falling like I never thought I could
My head is in a tailspin
My heart just took a tumble
This time I stumbled on the soft and good
My head is in a tailspin
My heart just took a tumble
This time I stumbled on
To something good
