Let's go downtown, see the boats in the harbor
Sit in the park, listen to the band
I'm going downtown, have a cappuccino
Why don't you join me, I know you can
Downtown is just a few miles
I've been there a hundred times
I can pick you up in my car
Just give me some sort of sign
Let's go downtown
Will you go with me, sit under a banyan
Splurge on a burger, drink an IPA
We'll have a good time if we go early
Shorts and t-shirt, just you and me
Downtown is just a few miles
I've been there a hundred times
I can pick you up in my car
Just give me some sort of sign
Let's go downtown
We'll walk on the pier and we'll soak up the sun
We'll stay there all day, be tired when we're done
Then we'll go home and take a hot shower, head up to bed
I'll show you how, but will it happen?
I sure do hope so
I think you should come
Spend a day by the bay
I'm going downtown
See the boats in the harbor
Sit on a park bench
Drink an IPA
Downtown is just a few miles
I've been there a hundred times
I can pick you up in my car
Just give me some sort of sign
Let's go downtown
So will it happen?
I sure do think so
Yeah you should come
Spend a day by the bay
We're going downtown
See the boats in the harbor
Sit on a park bench drinking IPA
Drinking IPA
Drinking IPA
