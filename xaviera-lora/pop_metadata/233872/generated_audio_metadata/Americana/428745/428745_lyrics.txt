Here in the panhandle, I'm fit to be fried
Thinking it over, knowing everybody lied about him
Here I am
A promise and a dollar, we'll buy you a drink
A coffee and a cup while you sit here and think as the dust
Fills your lungs
Don't listen to your friends
Don't listen to your heart
Don't listen to anyone
Don't draw on the charts
it don't matter at all
It won't work out after all
And here you are
There's nothing as far as the eye can see
But the wind blows on endlessly
At least you've got your thoughts
Bitter as they are
Buck up and face the fire with muddy tears
A lone desert flower and the sinner on heat
A rose in the desert, together we beat the odds
Curse the gods
The days never ended, just oil or dirt
A film of frustration, coated in hurt, love romance
Of dreams and days
The clock's running faster, time's running out
I feel myself graying, alone with my doubts
I watch him driving down
The dirt road out of town, and here I am
And with frustration, pain and regret
The columns and shadows that watch the sunset
Stuff my hopes in keepsake box
And snap the heart-shaped lock
And curse the dust
