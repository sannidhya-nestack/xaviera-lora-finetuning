Come on son, turn off the TV
Put down that game and sit down on my knee
Today is the day called Memorial Day
It's special to our family
Here's Grandpa's picture
He looks a lot like me
He was a sailor heading out to the coral sea
Memorial day
Now his life is gone
But in our memories
He will always live on
Uncle Joe fought in Germany
We don't know how he died
But daddy always kept his letters
And this picture by his side
A bullet or a river swept his life away
That's why we plant flowers by his grave
On Memorial Day
Though his life is gone
In our memory
He's still young and strong
Every family has a story from Afghanistan to Vietnam
In the cities of Iraq or the desert of Iran
In Europe or Korea or an unknown grave at sea
Somewhere in someone's heart
There's a living memory
On Memorial Day
Though their lives are gone
In our nation's memory
They will always live on and on
They will always live on and on
