Over there, over there
Send the word, send the word over there
Hear them calling you and me, every son of liberty
Hurry right away, no delay, go today
Over there, over there
Send the word, send the word over there
That the Yanks are coming
The Yanks are coming
The drums rum-tumming everywhere
So prepare
Say a prayer
Send the word
Send the word
To be fair
We'll be over
We're coming over
And we won't come back until it's over over there
Over there, over there
Send the word, send the word over there
That the Yanks are coming, the Yanks are coming
The drums rum-tumming everywhere
So prepare, say a prayer
Send the word, send the word to beware
We'll be over, we're coming over
And we won't come back till it's over over there
