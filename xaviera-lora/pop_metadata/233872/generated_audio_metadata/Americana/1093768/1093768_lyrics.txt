We had a boy, precious to the moon for us and it was a ploy
To try to make us human, not another couple trying to find
A reason for our pantomime
We had a purpose that was bigger than the sun, he met a girl
Someone who was on his side, she is his world
Someone who will share the ride to where no one can ever know
We always hope the road will show us why we are here
So take the long road
Down familiar avenues
Try to unload
All the burdens you've accrued
And be grateful
For the journey you are on
And use the elders
For the wisdom they have gained
Stoke the embers of the love inside the rain
And remember those who helped along the way
When we are one
All the world is ours but it's no fun
Then we make it two and we've begun to find out what it's like to share
The puppies and the cats are there still there's something missing
And we both know what it is when we are three
The world revolves around the child we see
We try to shape the person they become
When they're shining in the sun
We hope they find the wisdom that we try to pass along
In the end we all do our best
To keep the good and then toss out the rest
To be the person that they need
So take the long road down familiar avenues
Try to unload all the burdens you've accrued
And be grateful for the journey you are on
Use the elders
For the wisdom they have gained
Stoke the embers of the love inside the rain
And remember those who helped along the way
You just take the long road
Down familiar avenues
Try to unload all the burdens you've accrued
And be grateful for the journey you are on
And use the elders
For the wisdom they have gained
Stoke the embers of the love inside the rain
And remember those who helped along the way
