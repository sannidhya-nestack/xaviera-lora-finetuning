I took cocktails with lonely Abigail
When our ship was set to sail
She said, "I swear, ain't this like a fairy tale?"
I said my life was hell until you turned up at my gate
And you were never ever my Miss Perfect
I'll never be your Mr. Right
At least we've got to know each other
At least we are
Together here tonight
I took sweet tea
With Leslie in a cafe in Chelsea
She looked at me
Intensely
Said, "Do you like my dear Elvis Presley?"
I said, "My life was messy until you turned up at my gate"
And you were never ever my Miss Perfect
I'll never be your Mr. Right
At least we've got to know each other
At least we are together here tonight
I drank sherry with handsome Mary
Whose hair was distant cherry
She occupied the berry
I said Mary please be wary
Of the Home Secretary
If he turns up at your gate
Because my heart is yours forever
And you were never ever mine this perfect
I'll never be your Mr. Right
At least we've got to know each other
At least we are together here tonight
At least we are together here tonight
At least we are together here tonight
