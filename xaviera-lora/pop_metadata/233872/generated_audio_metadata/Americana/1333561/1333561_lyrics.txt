We've travelled in darkness, in search of the light
Our country's seen sadness, had long sleepless nights
Our voices are silenced, when they need to be raised
Strong words never said
Leave us half-crazed
And we've undone the hard work
Of past generations
Found excuses to shirk
False media creations
And when we are done
There's no turning back
We'll be master of none
From being so far off track
There'll be nothing left to unpack
When there's no turning back
There's no turning back
First step down a new road
Can feel a bit uncertain
Time to carry the load
Pull back the curtain
Heart can change a mind
Share an invite today
Best not to fly blind
Down information's highway
Take a look around
We're honor bound
We've undone the hard work
Of past generations
Found excuses to shirk
False media creations
And when we are done
There'll be no turning back
We'll be master of none
From being so far off track
Life can be hard to unpack
Better change now before
There's no turning back
There's no turning back
