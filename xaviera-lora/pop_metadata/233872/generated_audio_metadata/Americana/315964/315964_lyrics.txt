We start your day with a greasy breakfast
Hash browns, bacon, toast
Don't et that butter
Don't et that butter
Spread what you want on your toast
I just wanna watch you order
Good biscuits, good gravy
Darling you float my gravy boat
Help yourself to that sauce
Pour it on everything
Veggies, meatloaf, taters
Go ahead and ladle it
Go ahead and ladle it
Eat and get meat on your bones
I just wanna watch you order
Good biscuits, good gravy
Darling you float my gravy boat
Coffee is good too after that meal's through
After the gravy's been flowing
Good old Joe right in your hand
Fill it up, won't you ma'am
We start your day with a greasy breakfast
Bacon, hash, browns, toast, don't et that butter
Don't et that butter
Spread what you want on your toast
I just wanna watch you order
Good biscuits, good gravy
Darling, you float my gravy boat
I just wanna watch
You order good biscuits, good gravy
Darling, you float my grave aboard
Darling, you float my grave aboard
Darling, you float
My Grave-A-Bone
