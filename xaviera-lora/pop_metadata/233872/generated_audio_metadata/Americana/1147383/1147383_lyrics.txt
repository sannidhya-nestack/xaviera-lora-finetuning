Cold water in my mind, in my soul
Feels like cold, cold water in my heart, black as coal
Cold water in my mind, in my soul
Feels like cold, cold water
In my heart, black as coal
Cold water in my soul, in my blood
Cold, cold dark water
Coming down like a flood
One day soon I'll be
Dead and gone from this earth
And that cold water
Wash away all I'm worth
The songs I've been singing
Since the day
You were born, let those words keep on ringing in your head
Oh, when you mourn
Oh, your sons and daughters that went down and won't return
of that cold blood
Water running through my wicked mind
Cold water in my soul and in my blood
Cold dark water coming down like a flood
My God, you're burning high, seen what I've done
You'll drown me in cold water before I make my way back home
