You're a high heel walker
You're a street wise talker
Oh yeah

Try to understand you and I try to comprehend
You want me as a brother, as a lover or a friend
And I got to thinking hey it ain't that way at all
You're just a high heeled stroller heading for a fall
You're a high heeled walker
You're a street wise talker
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Hey, I'll tell you about it
Lay down last night with just some questions on my mind
How could you treat a girl who's so unkind?
So unkind, I said, so unkind

You're a high heel walker
You're a streetwise talker, oh yeah
Oh yeah, you're a high heel walker
You're a streetwise talker
Oh yeah, here's to the bro baby
If I think about it now it all falls into place
Still see that kiss you hugged me look upon your face
I look right through it to your sore reflecting eyes
You ain't nothing but a demon in disguise
You're a high heeled walker
You're a street wise talker
Oh yeah oh yeah
Hear a high heeled walker
Hear a street swastika, oh yeah, oh yeah
High heel walka (high heel walka)
Streetwise walka (streetwise talka)
