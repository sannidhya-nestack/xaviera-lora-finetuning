I pull down the shades and I turn off the lights
I dance in the dark and I dream
As I rock my hopes into empty arms
I wonder what life's like out there
Is it dangerous?
My mother said, better to stay home safe than your bed
Yes it's dangerous, can't you see dangerous for me
Faces, faces everywhere
Girl with the wild, unnerving stare
The strange young man with a face of stone
Down on the corner all alone
Yes it's dangerous in the cold unknown
Dangerous when you're out on your own
Dangerous, just to pick up the phone
Dangerous for me
And I pass you now like I do everyday
I say hello
What would you say? Would you quicken your steps? Would you run away?
Am I so dangerous to you?
Am I dangerous?
Could I get to your heart?
Dangerous?
Better yet not to start
fear is much safer than love, you see
And love's very dangerous to me
So very dangerous to me
So I pull down the shades and I turn off the light
I dance all alone in the dark
As I rock my hopes into empty arms
I wonder what life's like out there, out there
