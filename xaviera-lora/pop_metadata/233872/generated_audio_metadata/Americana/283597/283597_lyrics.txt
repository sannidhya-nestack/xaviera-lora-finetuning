Today our nation saw evil, the very worst of human nature
And we responded with the best of America
With the daring of our rescue workers
With the caring for strangers and neighbors who came to give blood
And help in any way they could
If I were to tell you something I haven't until today
I would say that I'm a different person than the one they sent away
I have seen fashion and fame
And days of bitter be discovered again
I've seen ordinary days unfold
And towers fall and planes explode
So I became a soldier
492K1 and then they sent me over
Oh mama the things we've done
I have seen pleasure in pain
From either side of this war machine
I've seen the horror in a mother's eyes
When a baby falls and angels rise
Under the flag we got here
Under the flag
We fought here under the flag
I'm not sure
I wanna go home
Under the sun we let fly
Bullets and praise that God won't buy
Underneath the stars spangled banner
Under the rockets red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Mama can I tell you something
Mama can I confess
Even though I volunteered
I didn't sign up for this
I have failed triumph and shame
To get these oil fields running again
So Halliburton and Chevron
Could fill their pipes and burst their bombs
Under the flag
We got here under the flag
We fought here under the flag
I'm not sure
I wanna go home
Under the sun we let fly
Bullets and tears that God won't dry
Underneath the stars spangled banner
Under the rockets red glare
The bombs bursting in air
And we all stand together
We're brothers to the bone
One way or the other
Brothers we'll get home
Under the flag
We got here under the flag
We fought here under the flag
I'm not sure
I wanna go home
Under the sun we let fly
Bullets and prayers that God knows why
Underneath the stars spangled banner
Under the rockets red glare
The bombs bursting in air
None of us will ever et this day
Yet we go forward to defend freedom
Under the flag
And all that is good and just
Under the flag
In our world
Thank you
Under the flag
Good night and God bless America
