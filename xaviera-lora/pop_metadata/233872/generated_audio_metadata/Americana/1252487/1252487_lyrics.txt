These are the boots upon my feet in which I walk alone
These are the streets in which I walk in which I call my own
I walk these streets a thousand times with every passing day
And I can't feel that coming down in every single way
I wake up the town, I throw the boot, get through the people, now wake up the town
Wake up the town and throw the boogie to the people now wake up the town
Wake up the town and throw the boogie to people now wake up the town
Wake up the town and throw the boogie to the people now wake up the town
Uniform gang up on the streets, beating the people's soul
Cracking heads with that like I'm Grace, the way they have been taught
People are scared they do not know that liberty has been sold
They were asleep they did not see the way the money flows
Wake up, I tell the truth, we'll get to the people, now wake up, I tell'em
Wake up, I tell the truth, we'll get to the people, now wake up, I tell'em
I wake up the town and throw the boogie to the people and I wake up the town
I wake up the town and throw the boogie to the people and I wake up the town
I see a man in a tie and suit lying up on TV
It is the death of day, but it's totally been nothing to believe
All of them faking, all of them talking, smiling at lies they use
They color the words and fill the page and they brush out the truth, ah
Wake up, now turn and show the boogie to the people, now wake up the town
Wake up, now turn and show the boogie to the people, now wake up the town
I wake up in the town I throw the boogie to the beat when I wake up in the town
I wake up in the town I throw the boogie to the beat when I wake up in the town
Wake up, now time to throw the boogie to the people, now wake up
Now time to throw the boogie to the people, now wake up
Now time to throw the boogie to the people, now wake up
Now time to throw the boogie to the people
