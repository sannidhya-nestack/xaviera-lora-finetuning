Don't ask me how I feel
Just one look and you know
I feel great
And believe me I'm giving it to you straight
I feel great
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Every day is your best day
What are you waiting for?
Colour me pink, colour me red, colour me blue instead
It won't matter to me,'cause today is the day (I decided to feel)
I decided to feel brave (I decided to feel brave)
Others may talk about good and bad days
They believe only great is on holidays
You decide today is the day
There's nothing can hide those feelings inside that you
Color me pink, color me red, color me blue, feel great
It won't matter to me'cause today is the day
I decided to feel great
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Every day is your best day
What are you waiting for?
Color me pink, color me red, color me blue instead
It won't matter to me'cause today is the day
I decided to feel great (I decided to feel great)
(I decided to feel great)
(I decided to feel great)
