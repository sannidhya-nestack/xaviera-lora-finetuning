Maybe
A little old fashioned
I may not have the years
I certainly have the tears and pain
That drives me into the ground
I listen to the Cubs on AM radio
I may not be up on all the new lingo
I may be a little old fashioned
But I feel as old as I can be
I would love to hear an old vinyl record
All its pops and cracks
You really feel the tracks the way
I think they're supposed to sound
I love to hear good old Hank Williams
Singing I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
I may be old fashioned
Yet I feel as old as I can be
Every now and again
I know I need to catch up with the world
Now I feel like I'm growing old too soon
And that's something I can't blame on anything
Maybe
A little old fashioned
May not have it yet
But I certainly have the tears and pain
That drives me into the ground
Well, maybe
A little old fashioned
Maybe that's all that I can be
I feel as old as I can be
I feel as old as I can be
I feel as old as I can be
