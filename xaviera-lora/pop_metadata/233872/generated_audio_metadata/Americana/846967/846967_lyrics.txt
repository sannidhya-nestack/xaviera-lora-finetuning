I'll finish up the dishes while you watch TV
Go ahead dear have a seat
It doesn't bother me
Can I fluff your pillow
Fix you something else to eat
How about I rub your feet
Would you like to get some sleep
I must admit I don't know what you're going through
But I just can't help smiling while I'm lying close to you
our love is alive and kicking
We'll be babysitting in a few more days
Yes, our love is alive and kicking
With a new addition well on the way
You've sure gone through some changes and it really shows
You're wearing funny clothes
You can't even see your toes
But you've never looked more lovely than you do tonight
There's a warm glow in your eyes
I'm such a lucky guy
You've got your suitcase packed and I've got my cigars
Just tell me when it's time to go
I'm ready when you are
Cause our love is alive and kicking
We'll be babysitting in a few more days
Yes our love is alive and kicking
With a new addition well on the way
If our love is alive and kicking
We'll be babysitting in a few more days
Yes our love is alive and kicking
With a new addition well on the way
