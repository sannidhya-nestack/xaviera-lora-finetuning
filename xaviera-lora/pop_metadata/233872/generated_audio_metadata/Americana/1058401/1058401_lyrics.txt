I've started heaven knows
Fourteen years are indisposed
Medicaid and how it goes
And I will let you get your way
But you won't ever find your way back home
In your eyes are vacant blue
Double vision, nothing new
Complicated, see it through
And I will let you get your way
But you won't ever find your way back home
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
All those people lost and found
Devils dancing all around
Wishful thinking buckled down
And I would let you get your way
But you won't ever find your way back home
Ever since you lost control
Poor decisions claim your soul
Cast a shadow, dig a hole
And I will let you get your way
But you won't ever find your way back home
Oh, and I will let you get your way
But you won't ever find your way back home
Ooh, gasoline
Ooh, gasoline
And I will let you get your way
But you won't ever find your way
And I will let you get your way
But you won't ever find your way
And I will let you get your way
But you won't ever find your way
Back home
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Gasoline
Ooh, gasoline
