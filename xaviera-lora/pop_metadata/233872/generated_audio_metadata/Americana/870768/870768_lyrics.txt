Let's go down to the river, become martyrs here today
Worship way beyond redemption, trade some sins so we can play
On a mountain full of ammo, near a bridge we mustn't close
We're a bold and passionate vision, and we're ready to explode
I'm dying now, you said so
Rising to a higher cause
You're lying now, I think so
But my judgment's placed on pause
Count my wives, there are plenty
Procreation run amok
Off the grid we make our own rules
Leaving nothing to pure luck
Got more lawyers on retainer
So we'll never go to jail
We're a cult of our own making
Come and listen to our tale
I'm dying now, you said so
Rising to a higher cause
You're lying now, I think so
But my judgement's placed on pause
I'm dying now, you said so
Rising to a higher cause
You're lying now, I think so
But my judgement placed on pause
Under pretense of religion
No taxes paid at all
We're an island in a country
Where our brethren hear the call
Where the women and the children
Abrogate their every right
And the reason to be living
Is the journey toward the light
I'm dying now, you said so
Rising to a higher cause
You're lying now, I think so
But my judgement's placed on pause
You're lying now, I think so
But my judgement's placed on pause
