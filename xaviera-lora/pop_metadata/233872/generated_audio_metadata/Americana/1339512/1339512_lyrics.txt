Spend a little time
And you know that you'll be mine
Life is a highway
Filled with many twists and turns
When the road gets rough
We'll be strong enough
Life will get better as long as we
Together, together
There's no one like you
Make your every wish come true
I'll stand by your side
Shining stars will be our guide
As long as we're together, together
When the road gets rough, we'll be strong enough
Life will get better as long as we're together
Together
Hand in hand from the start
You're always in my heart
Together
When the road gets rough, we'll be strong enough
Life will get better as long as we're together, together
Together
