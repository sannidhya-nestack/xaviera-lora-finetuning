In Bambridge town, the walls came down
And peace ruled for a time anyway
And Rafferty was a tavern keep
a band of rogues came and drank his wine
And they took his wife, saying, "Tie Rafferty down"
Don't let'em make a sound
Though the winds may blow and the trees may grow
But tie your Rafferty down boys
When I looked in the eyes of a sun-naught mind
Rages like chills crawled up my spine
Just not a day goes by that I don't awake to my revenge
My boy and I in a rusty knife
Traveled a trail as cold as ice
In hopes to put the fear of God in those devil's eyes
Who sank Tyraffordy down
Don't let it make a sound
But the winds may blow and the trees may grow
But time will have to lay down boys
Well hold on steady my son
The work here is almost done
And I can't wait to see
The fear on their faces
Hold steady my son
Some men from Clown
Said they could be found
Far to the south in a burned out church on holy ground
And when Rafferty came
To lay his blame
Those sleeping demons never heard a thing and they went up in flames
Saying, "Tie Rafferty down
Don't let him make a sound"
Whatever winds may blow and the trees may grow
But tie Rafferty down boys
You can't tie Rafferty down
He burned their church house down
Now the fallen leaves from the burned out trees
Will never make a sound
