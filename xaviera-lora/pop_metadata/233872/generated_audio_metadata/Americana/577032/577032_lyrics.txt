You seem a little nervous, maybe you're just shy
You say you lost in love before and you're afraid to try
With me by your side girl, you won't need to worry
Put your little hand in mine, you know you won't be sorry
Ah now give it up baby, give it up baby
Listen to me one time
Give it up baby, give it up baby
You know you're so fine
Give it up baby, give it up baby
Listen to me one time
Give it up baby
Summing off of the moon and stars I say let her try
We can have heaven right here on earth so let's get together and fly
Your heart is beating way too fast your thoughts are in a flurry
Moving a little closer now we'll take our time don't worry I'll nap
Give it up baby give it up baby
All your old hills so fine give it up baby give it up baby
Oh, you know you're my kind now, give it up baby, give it up baby
Oh, move a little closer now, give it up baby (Move a little closer now, give it up baby)
Give it up baby, give it up baby, leave the past behind
Give it up baby, give it up baby, I tell you you're my kind
Give it up baby, give it up baby, let's see what we can find now
Give it up baby, give it up, yeah
