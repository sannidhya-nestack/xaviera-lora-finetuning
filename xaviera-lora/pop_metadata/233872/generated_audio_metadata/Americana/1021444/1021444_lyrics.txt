an wipes the tears away
As her youngest throws his hat
How quickly seasons change
And the leaves fall
And the leaves fall
And the leaves fall
Alan visits every week
Dana can't recall his name
You cannot sell your soul
And the leaves fall
And the leaves fall
And the leaves fall
Rogers picture on the wall
Thirty years with the firm
Folks won't do that anymore
Casey looks up at the hills
Nothing pressing for the day
There's a trail out there for you
And the leaves fall
And the leaves fall
And the leaves fall
