When Johnny comes home again, hurrah, hurrah
We'll give him a hearty welcome then, hurrah
Hurrah, the men will cheer, the boys will shout
The ladies they will all turn out
And he'll be here to stay when Johnny comes home
The old church bell will ping with joy, hooray, hooray
To welcome home our darling boy, hooray
Hurrah, the village lads and lasses say
With roses they will show the way
And he'll be here to stay when Johnny comes home
Get ready for the Jubilee, hurrah, hurrah
Give the hero three times three, hurrah
Hurrah, the Lord breathed his breath in you now
To place upon this loyal brow
You'll be here to stay when Johnny comes home
