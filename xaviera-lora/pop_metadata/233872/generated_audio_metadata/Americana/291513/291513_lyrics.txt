A mother sat her daughter down and tried to ease her mind
Held a dusty photo album, she felt that it was time
Out fell some letters, softly to the ground
Ink on yellowed paper, she didn't make a sound
Staring at the words written in her father's hand
She never got to meet him, she tried to understand
Her daddy wrote these letters before he went away
He wanted you to have them on your special days
When you open up this letter it will be your graduation day
You know that I would be there if I could
They'll have your share of worries
Questions and uncertainties
Other times you'll feel misunderstood
Don't be afraid, you're not alone
Dream with all your soul
This letter from heaven to you
She stared back at his picture, she's got her father's eyes
Her laugh is unmistakable, she'll always have his smile
Handsome as a soldier, a duty to perform
He made that final sacrifice the day that she was born
When you open up this letter
It will be your perfect wedding day
You know that I would be there if I could
marriage is a special house
Rich in happiness
Built with love instead of stone and wood
Don't be afraid, be full of hope
And dream with all your soul
This letter from heaven to you
She always got letters from heaven
A few words could always see her through
Somehow they'd arrive
Always right on time
From a daddy she never knew
When you open up this letter
You will see that it will be the last
You know that I would be there if I could
Life is a blessing, treasure every day
Live it to the fullest like you should
Don't be afraid, you're not alone
And dream with all your soul
This letter from heaven to you
This letter from heaven to you
