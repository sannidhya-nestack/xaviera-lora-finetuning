I'll learn to follow if you take the lead
There's hours tomorrow, that's what you believe
But there are no tomorrows, ive me if you please
Judas missed the bus to bury Grandpa Keys
I started thinking, my ears were ringing
The priest and the cassock had the whole thing swinging
Couldn't carry the weight for that time to grieve
Judas missed the bus to bury Grandpa Keys
The smile that I got is the same one on your face
It's just the mirror that puts me in your place
I showed late for the station it was time to leave
But you dismissed the bus to bear at Grandpa Keys
The word came on Monday half past the day
When we left for the border to hear the gypsies play
My mind is on that moment we will forever grieve
Judas missed the bus to bury Grandpa Keys
People from the north are seeds from somewhere else
Take the time to visit when they still have their health
Grandpa played his songs, he played them all for free
But Judas missed the bus to bury Grandpa Keys
I was fooled, I was believing, I memorized the part
I dodged them holes of sorrow in a land of broken hearts
My mind is on that moment, I will forever grieve
Judas missed the bus to bury Grandpa Keys
Her word came on Monday, half past the day
When we left for the border to hear the gypsies play
My mind is on that moment we will forever grieve
Judas missed the bus to bury Grandpa Keys
Judas missed the bus to bury Grandpa Keys
Judas missed the bus to bury Grandpa
Grandpa Keys
