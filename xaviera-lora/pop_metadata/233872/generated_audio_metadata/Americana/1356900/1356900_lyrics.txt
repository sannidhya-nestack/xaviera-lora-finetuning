I've been in a few nasty storms
Built the walls to keep me warm
But every battle, every scar
Was the path to where you are
It's not gold, it's not fame
It's not the glory in this game
It's the way you say my name
Just the way you say my name
Love me and I'll love you, that's all
No crown, no throne, but I'll walk tall
Let the world spin out of control
You found my heart and my soul
Love me and I'll love you
That's everything
I've seen lots of distant towns
I've felt the loneliness bring me down
But your voice cuts through the noise
Turns my heartache into pure joy
So let the thunder roll in the angry sky
I'll hold you close'til the day I die
If there's just one thing I'll rise above
It's just you and me and to this love
Love me and I'll love you that's all
No crown, no throne
But I'll walk tall
Let the world spin out of control
You found my heart and my soul
Love made out of you
That's everything
