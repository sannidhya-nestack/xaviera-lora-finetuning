I'll be waiting'til the hope is almost gone
I'll be waiting from the morning to the dawn
When I retire is where you make your lonely home
Pouring showers on the wilderness I roam
Time is like a thief
Only brings you grief
Wheels in your mind
Spin like a carousel through time
I'll be waiting like a song that never ends
I'll be waiting by the river where it bends
Soon you will awaken to the sound of ancient drums
Softly sailing round the mountain when she comes
Now is all I know
Steady as we go
The river in your mind
Flow to the crooked straits of time
I'll be waiting by the window'til you're here
I'll be playing a guitar to an empty chair
Sun beyond your face and moon beyond your back
I'll be waiting when the train runs out of track
Every raging sea delivers you to me
Every aching mile knows of the glory of your smile
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
I will be waiting
