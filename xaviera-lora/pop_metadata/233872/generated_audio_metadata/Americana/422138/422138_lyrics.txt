He took my hand, his only son
And he led me into the mountains of Table Rock
Down Linville e
Where he painted the beauty of the mountains
He said, "Son, this is the goodliest land
My father used to take me here"
Drink from the spring where I drank as a boy
It's the water of life, so sweet and clear
He took my hand, his only son
And He showed me the mystery of the mountains
From wise men's view (from wise men's view)
We saw the lights (we saw the lights)
We saw them flicker and fade into the mountains
Son, this is the goodliest land
My father used to take me here
Drink from the spring where I drank as a boy
It's the water of life, so sweet and clear
Now I take your hand, my only son
And I lead you into the mountains
Up Table Rock, down Linville e
Where I sing about the beauty of the mountains
Son, this is the goodliest land
My father used to take me here
But the sins of men have destroyed this spring
The water of life so sweet and clear
