Soon we'll come hurling out of the blue
Dropping our bombs on the ground
It's something I must do if we can make it and come back alive
That's all that matters for now
And oh, I'm feeling older
Fade upon my shoulder
The world has turned one more time around
With jet engines screaming
No time to find a meaning
My fine friends
Where we go by
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Where we go about
With jet engines screaming
No time to find meaming
My fine friends
Where we go bam
Yeah yeah
Where we go bam
Yeah, yeah, we go bound
