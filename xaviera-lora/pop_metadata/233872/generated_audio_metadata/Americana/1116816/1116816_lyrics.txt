Gotta let go, it's iron lungs cold
Scream down a whale, let the old bells toll
Look at that cross that cut so blue
Nailed to the wood by a steeple chased crew
It broke, I labored to prove a point
I planted a seed in that weed it joined
So I gotta let go, it's iron lungs cold
Scream down a whale
Let the old bells toll
I scraped the skin, I broke the nail
I squeezed the life, what's left to sell
I followed that bluff so I could see
As far as where, wherever I please
So I gotta let go
It's iron lungs cold
Scream down a whale
Let the old bells toll
It's still there
Passing the plain
Side by side
Drinking the rain
River boats and ships
Will raise their mast
We might as well use that wind
As long as it lasts
So I gotta let go
It's iron lungs cold
Scream down a whale
Let the old bells toll
Pressure will poison an empty head
If only my ship would have sailed instead
A sentinel guards that spectral view
Averting their eye to label the clue
Gotta let go, it's our lungs cold
Swim down a whale, let the old bells toll
No more knowing, nothing to see
Try to view
The leaves in the trees
How I get the love that I send
How I walk, hell this road won't bend
So I gotta let go
It's iron lungs cold
Swim down a whale
Let the old bells toll
Wings of reason
If only for flight
Swoop down low and guard me tonight
It's more than seed or planted thought
See what you see then subtract what you got
Gotta let go, it's iron lung cold
Scream down a whale, let the old bells toll
A slave to rule
But not to the cost
Humble little words
That stick in my mouth
Pieces together
Puzzles are solved
There's time to waste
The world will revolve
Gotta let it go
It's iron lungs cold
Scream down the well
Let the old bells toll
Is it forbidden
I'm tired of the night
Keep it all hidden
Close to my heart
Perched on a limb so long ago
So scream down a well at the old bells toll
