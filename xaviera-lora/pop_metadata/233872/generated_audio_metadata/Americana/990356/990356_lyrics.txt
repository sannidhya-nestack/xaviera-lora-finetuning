Great great granddad came to this land wearing everything he owned
Dug in the moon run mines till he was fifty nine
For black diamond blue coal stones
Barely making rent saved every cent to buy a farm for the family
When his days were done left it to his son till it made its way down to me
Now before I could walk before I could climb
Before I could talk
I spent most of my time
In the dirt
Sweet mother earth
In the clay and the dust and mud
In the dirt
For all it's worth, it's running through my blood
It's where I race my car, where I earn my scars
In my denims and t-shirt
When good old boys need to make some noise
We do it in the dirt
Before the sun comes out
There ain't no doubt I'll be turning up the sod
At the end of the day when it's time to play
Four wheelin' on the quad
my girl drops by with them sexy eyes
They cut through me like a knife
With the ring I bought, take her to our spot
And ask her to be my wife
We'll lay on the ground beneath the stars above
No one else around
And we'll kiss, we'll make love, yep
In the dirt, sweet mother earth
In the clay, in the dust and mud
In the dirt
For all it's worth, it's running through my blood
It's where I race my car, where I earn my scars
In my denims and T-shirt
When good old boys need to make some noise
We'd do it in the dirt
It gives me peace of mind that one day my great grandson might be
Standing under the same old oak right where they'll bury me
In the dirt, sweet mother earth
In the clay, in the dust and mud
In the dirt
For all it's worth, it's running through my blood
It's where I race my car, where I earn my scars
In my denims and T-shirt
When good old boys need to make some noise
We do it in the dirt
Oh, in the dirt
We do it in the dirt
Talkin'bout some good clean fun in the dirt
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm
