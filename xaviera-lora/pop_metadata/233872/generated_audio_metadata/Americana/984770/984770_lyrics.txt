All I ever got to show
Is the back of my army coat
The door says what I've got to say
When it's slammed shut and I walk away
The door says what I've got to see
When it's slammed shut and I walk away
Curseless echo burning me
I can be what I want to be
But I never wanted
To be frustrated
I wanted to run, I wanted to hide
But all I do is hide inside
As my heroes stand in mirrors
And search for truth
And those who wear pretends to care ask you from my youth, well
You're not talking about my generation anymore
Doped up hopes and this old brain
Back and forth on the L train
Don't I know this is my prime
I should do something with my time
But I never wanted to be frustrated
I wanted to run, I wanted to hide
But all I do is hide inside
As my heroes stand in mirrors and search for truth
And those who I pretend to care I've steal'd from my youth, well
Someone better save me (Someone better save me)
Someone better save me (Someone better)
Someone better save me
Save me from myself
Save me from myself
Save me from all I ever do
All I ever do
All I ever do
