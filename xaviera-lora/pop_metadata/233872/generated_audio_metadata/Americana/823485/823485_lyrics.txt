The days are hard, I can't stand the heat
I gotta get off this forsaken street
Now this place ain't working out for me no how
The money's gone, the cocaine too
I gotta find my next rendezvous
You know this place ain't working out for me no how
Well there goes my daylight, there goes my dreams
Looks like there goes my self esteem
Been walking this street since God knows when
Wishing I was still a good citizen
I fell in a trap so long ago
Over shortened damage like you would know
Now this place ain't working out for me no how
What a mess I'm in, you say to me
I'm trying to figure out my dependency
You know this place ain't working out for me no how
Well there goes my daylight, there goes my dreams
Looks like there goes my self esteem
Been walking this street since God knows when
For wishing I was still a good citizen
Well, there goes my daylight, there goes my dreams
Looks like there goes my self-esteem
Been walking this street since God knows when
Wishing I was still a good citizen
Oh, I fell in a trap so long ago
Overshot and damaged like you would know now
This place ain't working out for me no how
What a mess I'm in, you say to me
I'm trying to figure out my dependency
You know this place ain't working out for me no how
You know this place ain't working out for me no how
