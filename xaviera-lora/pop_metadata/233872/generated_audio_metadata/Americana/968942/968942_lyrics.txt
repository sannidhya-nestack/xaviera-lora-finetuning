I'm gonna carry a lamp to shine a light on, shine a light on me
Carry a lamp to shine a light on, shine a light on me
Take that boat across the water
To the promised lands
I'm gonna take that boat out across the water
And I'll meet you at the promised lands
I'm gonna carry a lamp to shine a light on, shine a light on me
I'm gonna carry a lamp to shine a light on, shine a light on me
Fetch your own water
Say your own prayer, you gotta fetch your own water
Well you gotta find your own way there
Yeah I'm gonna keep on moving
Until I find my own way there
I'm gonna carry a lamp to shine a light on, shine a light on me
I'm gonna carry a lamp to shine a light on, shine a light on me
Fetch your own water
Say your own prayer, you gotta fetch your own water
You gotta find your own way there
I'm gonna keep on moving
Yeah, till I find my own way there
Yes I am
Oh Lord, I'm gonna keep on moving
Until I find my own way, find my own way
Find my own way there
