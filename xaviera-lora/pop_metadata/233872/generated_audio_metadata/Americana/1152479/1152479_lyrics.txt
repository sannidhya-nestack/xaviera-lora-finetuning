If there ever was one notion, one last desire
I would have to say
I just wanted you to know
Just how I feel
I'm happy darling, it's all okay
It's all okay, not much else to say
It's all that way, for some reason I believe
Even though your face never left my eyes for a minute
There I was so surprised
That love's the only gift we could not give
So we leave and let live (leave and let live)
Leave and let live
Still I had to mention just one more thing
Even if I don't see you again
You have touched me forever
And all I have to say is
I'm happy darling it's all okay
It's all okay, not much else to say
It's all that way, for some reason I believe it's all okay
So don't go thinking that I'm missing you like crazy
That things will never be so much the same (much the same)
I tell you you don't want to know who made me say what words you heard
That I will never see you again
It's all okay, no much else to say (It's all okay, baby, I love you)
It's all that way (It's all that way)
For some reason I believe
It's all okay, not much else to say (say that a lot)
It's all that way (all that way) for some reason I believe
It's all okay, it's all okay, it's all okay, it all okay
