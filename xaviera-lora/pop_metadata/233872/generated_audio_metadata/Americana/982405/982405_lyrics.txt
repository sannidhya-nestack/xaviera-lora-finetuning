We walked proud when this land was new
Men of integrity wore red, white and blue
Men tough and brave at the Hindenburg Line
This country was yours, this country was mine
Now there's dissension, now there's a wall
The heavens cry tears when empires fall
The British, the French, all had their time
The Spanish, the Romans, all felt the sunshine
Sometimes the devil, sometimes a friend
But the glory days must come to an end
All powerful men will soon learn to crawl
The heavens cry tears when empires fall
Is it our turn? Will it be today or tomorrow?
The leaders won't suffer in a world full of sorrow
The truth will surround us from sea to shining sea
Now we'll know what fools we mortals be
We'll soon et we walked proud and tall
The heavens cry tears when empires fall
Is it our turn? Will it be today or tomorrow?
The leaders won't suffer in a world full of sorrow
The truth will surround us from sea to shining sea
Now we'll know what fools we mortals be
We'll soon et we walked proud and tall
The heavens cry tears when empires fall
