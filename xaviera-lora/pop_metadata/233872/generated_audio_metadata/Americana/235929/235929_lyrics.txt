I'm all alone, I'm all alone, I'm lonely
I'm just sitting here twisting in my fate
I was hoping to find that one and only
But I found you, and you're too far away
Yeah, I found you, so now I have to wait
It's so quiet I can hear my neighbors breathing
It's so quiet I can hear them brush their hair
I'm just sitting here staring up at the ceiling
Cause I'm right here and you're way over there
Yeah, I'm right here and you're way over there
So I'm gonna make a racket, gonna make some noise
Shout real loud, gonna raise my voice
Stomp all around with big shoes on
Until that quiet is gone, gone, gone
Something's trying to tell me that I can't get up
Something's trying to tell me that I'm stuck here on my own
if I leave I would press my luck
And I wouldn't be here when you call on the phone
Yeah, I wouldn't be here when you call on the phone
So I'm gonna make a racket, gonna make some noise
Shout with love, gonna raise my voice
Stomp all around with big shoes on
Until that quiet is gone, gone, gone, gone
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm all alone, I'm all alone, I'm lonely
I'm just sitting here twisting in my fate
I was hoping to find that one and only
But I found you, and you're too far away
Yeah, I found you, so now I'm gonna have to wait
But first I'm gonna make a racket, gonna make some noise
Shout real loud, gonna raise my voice
Stomp all around with big shoes on
Until that quiet is gone, gone, gone
Gonna make a racket, gonna make some noise
Shout real loud, gonna raise my voice
Stomp all around with big shoes on
Until that quiet is gone, gone, gone
Us, us, us, us, us, us, us
