I met a man while I was sleeping And he spoke these words to me
He said, "Believe"
A simple man of Galilee
He showed me lands of time otten
And he sang a simple prayer
I knew right there
That I would ask him, "Take my hand and lead me there"
Fare thee well, immortal danger
Do not lay your hands on me
For I will sail across the water
On the waves of destiny
For I have walked and I have stumbled
Through the briars and bramble sweet
I've lost my way and I have faltered
Like the man of Galilee
Won't you stay with me'til morning
Close your eyes and we will sleep
Until the valley's filled with clover
Far below the mountain steep
Fare thee well, immortal danger
Do not lay your hands on me
For I will sail across the water
On the winds of destiny
Fare thee well, immortal danger
Do not shed a tear for me
For I will sail until tomorrow
On the winds of destiny
