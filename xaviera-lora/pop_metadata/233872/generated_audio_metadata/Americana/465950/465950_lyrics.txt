I never really had a girl of my own
Always moving somewheres
Now I can't find home anymore
I don't know where to look
Once you drive these things awhile
You know it seems like
You could drive a million miles never stopping
Wide awake and completely hypnotized
This town reminds me of the place where I was born
When I see those children playing in the yard and laughing
I got some family but they're all spread out
Every year or two we meet for a weekend
Familiar strangers from another life
I found a path up to the creek
By the state road
And I laid down beside the falls
Maybe now that spring is here
We could take a walk
Cause this place reminds me of the town where I was born
And you remind me of this girl who moved away
I've had a real good time with you and your friends
And I know I'm not the only guy that you know
But I'm off the road and I'm looking for a job
Cause this place reminds me of the town where I was born
A bunch of skinny children playing in the yard
This town reminds me of the home that I pretend I had
And you remind me of this girl I never knew
But always wondered about
