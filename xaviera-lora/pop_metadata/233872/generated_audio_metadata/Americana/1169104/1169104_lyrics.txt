One, two, one, two, three
Teach me baby
Teach me to be your
Help me honey
Not to be bored
Teach me
Teach me again
Teach me honey if you're so smart
Teach me to calm my wandering heart
To make it finally stop
Teach me again
I can't keep pretending this love is all now
I can't keep defending my feelings won't stop
Teach me, teach me and win
You may think you know a thing or two at my hand
You may learn to accept some love and to stand
In the light of love's sweet way in living
And have every happy day
My heart's got its own radar and it's fixed on your smile
And mine has its language to speak to you all the while
Teach me, teach me again
Why you refuse to listen to any word I say
Make me feel like I don't deserve your attention anyway
Teach me
Teach me again
Teach me
Teach me again, man
