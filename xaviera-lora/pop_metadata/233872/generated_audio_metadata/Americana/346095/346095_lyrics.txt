It's three fifteen in the morning
And the train is right on time
I can hear that whistle blow
About five miles down the line
My baby said she'd be here
105, don't fret
She said that it was over with him
On the day we met
Train, train, take me out of here
Train, train
Take me out of here
Love is just a game
Oh, so they say
Win, lose or draw
There's a price to pay
Timing and so many things
Come into play
The only thing on time this time
Is that train today, yeah
Train, train
Take me out of here
Train, train
Take me out of here
Train, train, take me out of here
Train, train, take me out of here
