Well an old man told me once ago he said be someone to love
Even though it can be rough
He said hell if I know I don't think we're only flesh and blood
There's a connection with something there above
Be a man of your word, don't just follow the herd
Walk your own road, you might find something you like
And I've been trying to do so, and still have many roads to walk
I know whatever happens, I'll keep moving on
I know Santa and an angel might have done a few things wrong
Try to find a little peace for my soul
Times have changed and times will tell
Where I do belong
Maybe someday
I'll find home
Maybe someday I'll find home
Maybe someday I'll find home
