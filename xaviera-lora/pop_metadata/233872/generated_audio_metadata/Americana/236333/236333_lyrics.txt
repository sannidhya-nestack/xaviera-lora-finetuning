Mama used to say that I'd go far
She said, "You can be anything you'd like"
And I used to think I'd be a big star
Or fly a rocket ship up and through the sky
But as I grew I learned there were some things I couldn't do
Like carry a gun for what it's meant to do
So here's to my brothers, my sisters overseas
Who carry the guns and fight for life that's free
And I would like to thank you
For all that you do
Is my salute to you in the red, white and blue
And I live my life in peace from day to day
Making music and friends and taking time to play
But for all of the freedom that is me
I know freedom isn't free
So here's to my brothers, my sisters overseas
Who carry the guns and fight for life that's free
And I would like to thank you for all that you do
Here's my salute to you in the red, white and blue
But for my freedom and the life that lies ahead
I remember why the stripes were white and red
So here's to my brothers, my sisters who fought for me
Who carried the guns and died for victory
And to all the moms and dads who cry in disbelief
Your sons and daughters are heroes to me
So here's to my brothers, my sisters overseas
Who carry the guns and fight for a life that's free
And I would like to thank you for all that you do
Here's my salute to you in the red white and blue
So here's to my brothers and sisters overseas
Who carry the guns and fight for a life that's free
And I would like to thank you for all that you do
Here's my salute to you in the red, white, and blue
Here's my salute to you in the red, white, and blue
