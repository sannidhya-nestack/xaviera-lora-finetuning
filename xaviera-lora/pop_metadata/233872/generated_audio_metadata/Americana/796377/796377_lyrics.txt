Out on the edge, over the edge
Out on the edge, American dream
Out on the edge, over the edge
Out on the edge, American dream
Down on the street lives a girl named Ruth
Somewhere between the lies and the naked truth
Ruthie's got a habit and it's overdue
She's waiting for her night to deliver the news
Life on the edge of the American dream
Sometimes it makes you just wanna stop and scream
Out here, love is never what it seems
It'll cut you on the edge of the American, American dream
Out on the edge, over the ledge
Out on the edge, American dream
Ruthie knows the deal is under wraps
One false move and I'll be playing taps
She knows what she expects to catch a buzz
She's got to give it up to the local buzz
That's life on the edge of the American dream
Sometimes I need to just wanna stop and scream
Out here lovers never
What it seems, it'll catch you on the edge of the American, American dream (I'm on the edge, over the edge, I'm on the edge)
She once had daydreams made of gold and sand
Her life was like a magic song
Now she just wonders where the nightmare began
It all went very wrong
Your life went very wrong
Ruthie's whole world is a game of chess
The bishop has sins that he won't confess
The king takes a knight just to show who's best
Sacrifice the queen and you can't guess the rest
That's life on the edge of the American dream
Sometimes it makes you just wanna stop and scream
Out here love is never
What it seems, it'll cut you on the edge of the American, American dream
Out on the edge, over the edge
Out on the edge, American dream (American dream)
Out on the edge, over the edge
Out on the edge
