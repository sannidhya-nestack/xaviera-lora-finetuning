Walking to the bar
Is right down the street
It's really not so far
I got a date to meet
She ain't ever quite on time
Always a little late
Or sitting in the back room
And chatting about fape
Ain't that your pal Hal
She squeezed my hand and winked
And then she waved him over
And she got him a drink
It started with the chatter
We couldn't jam in a word
All that stuff that didn't matter
Still I never got hurt
We're talking about the songs where friends fade away
A sip in our Guinness till the end of the day
There ain't no need to shout
God only knows what you're talking about
You never know what's running out a drunkard's mouth
Like a brainless water spout
More alcoholic chatter
As I watch my date excuse it
To ease the words thrown at her
Whiteboard felt he abused it
I wanna blow my brains out (brains out)
There ain't no need to shout
Oh God only knows what he's talking about
You never know what's running out a drunkard's mouth
Like a brainless water spout
I would skate on the bill
It wouldn't wanna be ya
He was walking it to the till
And we just said we'll see ya
You never need to shout (I'm so tired of listening to your friend, hell, he never shuts up, he just keeps going on and on, I mean he's like a brainless waterspout, I can't understand him, how did you ever become friends with him, he just talks and talks)
You never get to say a word, he doesn't even ask me any questions
The bruise is flying out of his mouth, he couldn't see the spit, he's disgusting
How is this your friend? Okay, I know, I know he's your all time friend
But he doesn't shut up, he just goes on and on and on
There's plenty of bread with waters but I'm sick and tired
Tired of listening to what you say (There ain't no need to shout)
You think you might ask us one question about ourselves? (Ain't no need to shout)
Maybe ask me one question about myself? (There ain't no need to shout)
Your best friend maybe ask you one question about yourself? (Ain't no need to shout)
I don't need to get out of here
