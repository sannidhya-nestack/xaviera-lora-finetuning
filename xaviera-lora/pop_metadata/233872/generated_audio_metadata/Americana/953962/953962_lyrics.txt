I see the storm clouds rolling in
They make me feel so small
The road ahead is long I know
I'm waiting for a call
These eighteen wheels I'm driving on
We need a place to roam
I've got a son in Abilene
He needs his daddy home
Life on the highway it's hard to explain
It gets down in your soul and does something to your brain
North, south, east or west doesn't matter where I go
It's just one more day
That's life on the road
Won't be long till these tires are gone
My checkbook's in the red
The engine light it just came on
We're stationed just ahead
The DOT is on my back
My logbook's overdue
The diesel signs says 419
Don't know how long before I'm through
Life on the highway it's hard to explain
It gets down in your soul and does something to your brain
North, south, east, west doesn't matter where I go
It's just one more day
That's life on the road
Headed south to San Antone
With a heavy load of steel
I pray these straps are holding tight
My fingers they grip the wheel
Then I hear a still small voice
It says you'll be okay
I know there's angels watching me
Day after day
Life on the highway it's hard to explain
It gets down in your soul and does something to your brain
North, south, east or west doesn't matter where I go
It's just one more day
That's life on the road
That's life on the road
That's life on the road
