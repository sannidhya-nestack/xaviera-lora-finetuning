Wait September night near Lake Pontchartrain
So much on my mind that I can't explain
Well I'm saving it up, gonna see you soon
If I can find the time, New Orleans moon
Be waiting for the town, New Orleans moon
From the Vukery to these transatantines
I've been hanging on down in New Orleans
And I wear it thin in the afternoon
I'll save myself for the night
New Orleans moon
They're waiting for the night
Mm-hmm, New Orleans moon
Take it, Brent
We'll hear the jukebox croon
Old Rachel sounds, sweet Magnolia breeze
Almost hum along, well I might leave here
Dream tonight and drown if I can find the time
New Orleans moon, been waiting for the time
New Orleans moon
Ooh, yeah, yeah
