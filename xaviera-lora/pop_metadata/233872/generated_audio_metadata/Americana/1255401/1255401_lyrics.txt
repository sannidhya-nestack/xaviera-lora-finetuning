With the sun shining down
Feel like playing around
No better time than now
I can show you how
I jump high
I jump high
I don't hide
No better day than today
No better day than today
I don't hide
I don't hide
I don't hide
No better day than today
No better day than today
Pardon me, I'm sure
Pardon me, I'm sure
Pardon me, I'm sure
No, I'm a no-day-k-or
No, I'm a no-day-k-or
