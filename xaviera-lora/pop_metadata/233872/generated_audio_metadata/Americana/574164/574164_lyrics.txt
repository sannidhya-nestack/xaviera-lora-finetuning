I've been waiting such a long, long time
Well, I'm getting so worried I'm going out of my mind
Hurry home to me ASAP
Every minute seems like an hour has gone
And every hour feels like a day too long
Hurry home to me, ASAP
Well they say good things come to those who wait
But I've been waiting so long
You'll be lost if you hesitate
Why don't you come on home miss and don't let me worry one minute more
You got me talkin' to myself and walkin' the floor
Hurry home to me ASAP
Now they say good things come to those who wait
But I've been waiting too long
You'll be lost if you hesitate
Why don't you come on home?
Don't let me worry one minute more
You got me talking to myself and walking the floor
Hurry home to me ASAP
Why don't you come on home ASAP
