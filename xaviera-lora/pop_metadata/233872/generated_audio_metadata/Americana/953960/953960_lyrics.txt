We stumble through this forsaken life
It is fraught with fear and strife
There has to be more than this
We stumble through this forsaken life
I drag around this fallen chain
Every man is bound the same
Innocent and I bear the shame
I drag around this ball and chain
I've tried it all my way
There's really nothing more to say
Despair is found in worthy dues
I've tried it all my way
I drag around this ball and chain
Every man is bound the same
It is sin and I bear the shame
I drag around this ball and chain
The answer to my concrete lies
And the son of man who bled and died
For me he was crucified
Jesus who paid the price
Drag around this ball and chain
Every man is bound to sin
I'm no longer a slave to sin
it's covered by the blood of him
It's covered by the blood of Him
