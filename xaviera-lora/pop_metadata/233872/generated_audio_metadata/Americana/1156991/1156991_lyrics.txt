On the day she found Apache
Carol recognized her own
She was a tall blonde with a black belt
He was a handsome big red roam
So she paid eight hundred dollars
For that twenty-year-old horse
Friends told her she was crazy
But we were wrong, of course
She'd say Apache
Old Apache, who knows the ties that bind
From the moment that I saw him
I knew that horse could read my mind
Now Patchy was a wild one with a strange uneven gait
He would do fancy sidestep instead of walking straight
But she barely had to rein him or prod him with her knee
She'd just think of the direction and Apache would agree
She'd say, "Apache, who's Apache?"
Who knows the ties that bind from the moment that I saw him?
I knew that horse could read my mind
No one else could ever ride him
That crazy Appaloosa roam
But when Carol was astride him
He'd always bring her safely home, safely home
But then there came that summer, Carol had to go away
She boarded old Apache for eight months and a day
And when she came to get him, she might as well have known
That horse would not ive her for leaving him alone
So she put him out to pasture where the ancient oak trees grew
And by the time he left this green earth he was nearly forty-two
But before he went to lay down, he came to her back door
I guess he finally ave her after giving her what for
She'd say, "Apache, old Apache, who knows the ties that bind
From the moment that I saw him?"
I knew that horse could read my mind, read my mind
