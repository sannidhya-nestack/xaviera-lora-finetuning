Dirt road, a lonely hunter can't find his doe
She lost her antlers and broke her bones
He left a shotgun shell and stones at home
They put a buck in the back of a pickup truck
Take me home, let me go
I don't need no preacher man to save my soul
Tie me up
Throw your stones, but look me in the eye before you
Lock and load, lock and load
Save my soul and put a buck in the back of a pickup truck
The hunter lost his door
And he don't know where to go
And he's looking at me and my freedom speech
And his hunger starts to grow and show
Show me your shotgun
If looks could kill, you got a deadly one
And I'm tangled up in barbed wire
Yes, I'm dangling over your campfire
And I got stuck tangled up
I got stuck in the back of a pickup truck
Baptize, tell me lies, you're so quick to criticize
Break down, break my bones, break some bread with these home fools
Fight back, last attack, I'm gonna get you in the sack
And put a bucket in the back of a pickup truck
Take me home
Let me go
I don't need no preacher man to save my soul
He's gonna soak my jeans in gasoline
He's gonna strike a match on my disease
He put a buck in the back of a pickup truck
The hunter lost his dove
And he don't know where to go
And he's looking at me and my freedom speech
And his hunger starts to grow
Show, show me your shotgun
If looks could kill you got a deadly one
And I'm tangled up in fog wise
I'm tangled
It'll be okay if I, I got stuck tangling up
I got stuck in the back of a pickup truck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
