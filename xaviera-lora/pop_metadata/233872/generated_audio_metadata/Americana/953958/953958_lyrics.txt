By little country church there stands a stone
Who the only hero I've ever known
The factory world is home for forty years
I remember what he said as I fight the tears
Get'er done son
You got to make it your own way
Work hard every day
And learn to be a man
Get'er done son
But don't worry'bout tomorrow
Don't beg, steal, or borrow
Listen son
You got to get'er done
Every time I go back to my home
Well I'd take a walk to see my daddy's stone
Was a working man and I know how much he cared
By those simple words that I see written there
Get'er done son
You got to make it your own way
Work hard every day
And learn to be a man
Get'er done son
Don't worry'bout tomorrow
Don't beg, steal or borrow
Listen son
You got to get'er done
My mother stayed at home, I'm glad she did
My daddy wanted a home to raise kids
I know that it was tough to make ends meet
And I never will et what he said to me
Get'er done, son
You got to make it your own way
Work hard every day
And learn to be a man
Get'er done, son
But don't worry'bout tomorrow
Don't beg, steal, or borrow
Listen, son
You got to get'er done
And every time there's sweat upon my brow
I still know that my daddy's proud
When sun goes down on a long hard day
I can hear my daddy say
Get'er done, son
You got to make it your own way
Work hard every day
And learn to be a man
Get'er done, son
Don't worry'bout tomorrow
Don't beg, steal or borrow
Listen, son
You got to get'er done
Oh listen, son
You got to get'er done
