Someday down along the road I might realize
That carrying this heavy load is just a bunch of lies
Lies that nobody told me, lies that hid the truth
Lies that no one else can see
Lies that stole my youth
So when can I begin anew
And start all over again
What if I can't do the things
That I could back then
What if all my dreams and hopes just vanish into the past
If I can't do the things I need how could I ever last
Everything's much clearer when it's written in black and white
All the fancy colored words just fade into the night
My mind is overflowing like a bucket full of rain
Making me feel alive, I bestowing on me pain
And all the time I sit here casting shadows on the wall
Everyone keeps telling me that it's nothing at all
So when can I begin anew and start all over again
What if I can't do the things that I could back then
What if all my dreams and hopes just vanish into the past
If I can't do the things I need
How could I ever last
