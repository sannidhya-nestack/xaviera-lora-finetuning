The water runs only on toward the sea
As it winds down the valley and slows by the trees
And it courses through canyons displacing the stone
And moving on it's continually drawn
It forever will go
Like my heart will flow into yours
The flow of the river waters the land
And it never stops running, even blocked by the dam
And it carries whatever it wants down the stream
And moving on
It's continually drawn
It forever will go
Like my heart will flow into yours
Part of the water ends up in her cup
And part boils in kettles on a thousand cooktops
But the rest just keeps flowing on toward the sea
And moving on, it's continually drawn
It forever will go
Like my heart will flow into yours
