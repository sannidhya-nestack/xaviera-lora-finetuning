We were born alone
We will die alone
But at the end of days
We all find our way home
You've been burning bright
You've been close to the light
But at the end of days
Blindness will give way to sight
We all get down sometimes
Life can turn on a dime
But don't give up your fight in time
You will be fine, you will be fine
At the end of the day
We give thanks and pray
Because the darkest hour is always before the dawn
We all get down sometimes
Life can turn on a dime
But don't give up your fight
In time you will be fine
We all get down sometimes
Life can turn on a dime
But don't give up your fight
In time you will be fine
We all get down sometimes
Life can turn on a dime
But don't give up your fight in time
You will be fine, you will be fine
