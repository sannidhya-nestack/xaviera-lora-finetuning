My daddy ran beside me
When I learned to ride my bike
He held the handle bars
While I held on for dear life
That bike is gone forever
I can never ride it again
But the love my daddy gave
Is a gift that goes on giving
Love is a gift that goes on
Long after we are gone
And through the years the love we share will go on living
Love is a gift that goes on giving
My mama found the time
To sing me happy songs she always made me laugh
How I loved to sing along
Though now we're miles apart
In my heart I hear her sing
The love my mom gave
Is a gift that goes on giving
Love is a gift that goes on
Long after we are gone
And through the years the love we share will go on living
Love is a gift that goes on giving
Love is a gift that goes on
Long after we are gone
And through the years the love we share will go on living
Love is a gift that goes on giving
Love is a gift that goes on giving
