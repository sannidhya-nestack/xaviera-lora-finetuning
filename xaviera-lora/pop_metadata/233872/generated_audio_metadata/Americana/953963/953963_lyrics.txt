I lost my wife, family, in the collapse of'59
I gave myself to the Pemberton Mill and I escaped with just my life
I had no home, I had no job, I lost it all that day
The smell of the smoke and the burning death I had to leave, I could not stay
I dream, dream of a different life
One bereft of trouble and strife
The sun comes up and the sun goes down
To the day they lay me in the ground
I went to work on the iron road, five men to move the rails
Sixteen hours and a dollar a day, worked until my muscles failed
Hear the sound of the hammer beating, time with the song of men
Can you hear the captain shout and swing that hammer again and again
I dream, dream of a different life
One be ripped of trouble and strife
The sun comes up and the sun goes down
To the days that lay me in the ground
The mountain shows no mercy as we blow up its insides
I'll never et that violent day I saw it with my own eyes
Lightning flashed and the smell of smoke then everything was still
Just like that day four years ago that day at the Pemberton Mill
I dream dream of a different life
One bereft of trouble and strife
The sun comes up and the sun goes down
To the day they lay me in the ground
I dream, dream of a different life
One bereft of trouble and strife
The sun comes up and the sun goes down
To the day they lay me in the ground
