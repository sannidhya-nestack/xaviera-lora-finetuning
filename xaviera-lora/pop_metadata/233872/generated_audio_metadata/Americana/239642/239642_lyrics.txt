It's the blending of the ages, a having of our times
To put our songs upon the pages, let the words do their rhyme
It's the blending of the ages, you are young, I am old
To show you hope while war rages in words that will be told
Wouldn't it be nice to lead the normal life
To kids and a wife feel the domestic strife
Let's meet by the tree to write a song just you and me
To set loneliness away to be free
It's a blending of the ages
A having of our times
To put our songs upon the page
Just let the world
It's just the blending of the ages, you're so young and I am old
To show you hope while war rages in words that will be told
Under that tree I'll say understand
Loneliness is all that is not grand
John just wait for the call
You'll get the girl just like me
Love is worth the wait you'll see
It's a blending of the ages
A having of our times
To put our songs upon the pages
Let the words do their rhymes
It's just a blending of the ages, you're so young, I am old
To show you hope while the war rages in words that will be told
Your quarter life crisis, you wanna be six again
Try my midlife abyss, why do we worry us men
There's bigger things than us, let's do that song for your brother Ben
And my son Matt, not quite ten
It's a blending of the ages
A having of our times
To put our songs upon the pages
Let the words do
And it's the blending of the ages
You're so young and I am old
To show you hope while war ranges
In words that will be told
It's just the blending of the ages
It's just the blending of the ages
