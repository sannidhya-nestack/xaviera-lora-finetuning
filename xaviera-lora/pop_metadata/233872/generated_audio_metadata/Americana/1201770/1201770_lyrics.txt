Just about nine o'clock
He strolls in
You never know he was set by his friend
He orders a double scotch
And then he sits down
Leans back in his chair and looks around
He sees some old friends and waves them a greeting
But he sits alone by himself
There's no one here special, he's mean it
Makes you think he's been there and done it all
The ballroom dancer, he was one of the best
He lost his wife, now that's a real test
But before she died, she said go and live your life
So he comes here to dance with her memory
The music starts and he ventures a glance
Pretty girls, he picks one to dance
The dance and whirl, they spin them around
You can't even tell his feet touch the ground
Every night he moves like he did long ago
The skill and grace, it's a real magic show
So if you're out for the night
Well just pass him through
Come by, meet this man, he's eighty-two
He'll show you you can be young again
He says thank you with small talk and a grin
The band plays again, he starts to spin
Pretty girls all line up to dance with him
So if you're out for the night
Or just passing through
You gotta meet this man, he's 82
Every night old Ozzy puts on a show
Skilling grace, it's magic, oh
Just like a reimagined show
