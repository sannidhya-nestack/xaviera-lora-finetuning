You're out of shape, you wanna try and work it out
But nothing seems to go your way, running all the time in place
Inertia's strong, it's got a silent hold on you
All ambitions run away, staring at the walls all day
Your friends around, they try to say be positive
Do they et, sometimes it's just too hard to live
But while you're waiting for the grave, you better start it now
Your treadmill will run
You're finally trying to get it done
And then the hours melt to years
All your precious time is gone
Hide in your room, it's getting slower by the day
Happiness is oversold, nothing now to do but pray
Your enemies, they'll only try to break your stride
Just make the move, so you won't have to run and hide
All the things you want to do, you better start it now
(Humming)
Just take a chance
Why not take another ride
Don't fall to fears
it won't matter in this life
Anything you want to do
You better start it now
Just break these walls
There's no need to go and hide
And take the chance
No need to worry in this life
All the things you want to do
You better start it now
You're out of shape, you wanna try and work it out
The time we're living is so short, you'd better start it now
