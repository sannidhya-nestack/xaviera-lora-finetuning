Baby says she loves me
When I ride her through the night
I got a long red limousine
I gotta keep my engine clean
You know I love my baby
I don't ride her overtime
If I get my engine dirty
Baby says she'll put me down
Well, I roll up and I scrub and I clean it
She oils it every single night
Girls come around here looking for a ride
Well, keep my engine out of sight
She got a fine pocket lock
For me to pop my limousine
If I want that real good lovin'
I gotta keep my engine clean
Oh
Ay-yo, ay-yo
Rubbing, I scrub and I clean it
Telling little girls, "Oh, I'll sit every single night"
Girls come around here looking for a ride
Well, keep my engine out of sight
She got a fine parking lot
For me to pop my limousine
If I want that real good lovin'
I gotta keep my engine clean
If I want that real good lovin'
I gotta keep my engine clean
