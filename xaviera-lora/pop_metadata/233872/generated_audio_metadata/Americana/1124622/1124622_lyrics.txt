Every part of me is drawn to you like waves to the shore
The tide's too strong to hold it back with that kind of force
I tried so hard to keep it all contained
It happened so fast
Love was pouring out and rushing over me
And there's no turning back
'Cause you, you can't stop a river
From flowing to the ocean
And there's no way I can hold in this emotion
When I try to keep my feelings in
They just keep getting bigger
you can't stop love
And you can't stop a river
There's a stream that goes around a rock and turns with every bend
The one way trail it curves seems to know where it will end
Some things are stronger than they seem to be
More than I could know
I've been swept away by what I couldn't see
And love won't let me go
And you can't stop a river from flowing to the ocean
And there's no way I can hold in this emotion
When I try to keep my feelings in
They just keep getting bigger
you, you can't stop love
And you can't stop a river (you will always need her)
You can't stop a river (my love will never change)
You can't stop a river (you will always need the)
You can't stop a river (my love will never change)
No, you can't stop a river from flowing to the ocean
And there's no way I can hold in this emotion
When I try to keep my feelings in
They just keep getting bigger
you, you can't stop love
And you can't stop a river
No, you, you can't stop love
And you can't stop a river
