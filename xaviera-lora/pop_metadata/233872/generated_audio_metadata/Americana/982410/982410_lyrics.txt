They stormed the beaches of Normandy
They flew the B-52's
They did the job at Guadalcanal
They died for me and you
They died
They died in the sea
They died at Gettysburg and Waterloo
They died throughout our history
They froze in the cold
They were burned in the red hot sun
Fighting for our freedom
Heroes each and every one
Sing it loud, sing it strong
Let's pay tribute to the veteran song
Oh, it's their song
The veteran song
Fighting for flags of different colours
Fighting for the just cause
Fighting for the homeland
Sometimes on far away shores
Proud to wear the uniform
Back in our young
What is right or wrong
Is sometimes lost in the haste
Singin' loud, singin' strong
Let's pay tribute to the veteran song
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The veteran song
