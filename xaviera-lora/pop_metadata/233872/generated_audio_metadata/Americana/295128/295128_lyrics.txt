Got a banjo hidden under my bed
Like a gun in the pillow'neath my head
It's so deep don't make a sound
Guns and music all around me
Hidden banjo plays hidden chords
Sweet music playing, thank the Lord
Preacher says it'll take me to hell
Guns or music I can't tell
Which way mama should I go?
Truth or beauty, fast or slow
My destiny I wish I knew
Let me play my song for you
Daddy told me hide it son
Music's like a loaded gun
Shall I point it out or in?
Frailing clicking hear it spin
One night soon I'll load that gun
Tune my banjo, have some fun
Out of sight, I keep them ready
Under my finger, sure and steady
Which way, Mama, should I go?
Truth or beauty, fast or slow
My destiny, I wish I knew
Let me play my songs for you
Dust and cobwebs all around it
Hits so deep, like to never found it
This day, mama, this sweet day
I bring my music out to play
Which way, mama, should I go?
Truth or beauty, fast or slow
My destiny I think I know
I will play my song for you
