I hear your stories and I don't believe
I see no evidence that your hands are clean
I hear your lies and won't let you in
I know my history and what lies within
And it's a long hard way to fall
And it's a long, hard, hard way to fall
I hear the prophecy, the truth unfold
I hear it written in the words I hold
You seek to destroy this world from within
But you are damned, you fools, you cannot win
And it's a long, hard
On, way too far
And it's a long haul
On, way too far
And your one world government does not fool me
And your new world order does not scare me
your tyranny will cease to be
Well it's a long, hard, hard way to fall
And it's a long, hard, hard way to fall
