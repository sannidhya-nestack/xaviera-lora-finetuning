Blistered my bloody nose
Broken heart, shattered soul
Held apart, broken to heavy mine
What a faulty
NSA
With a heart
That isn't right
Or out of power
Nothing to prove
Been here before
Open up your eyes
I'm headed for the door
No chance to be
No chance to be
No chance to be
No chance to
I'm tangled in my high street
I'm tangled in my high street
I'm tangled in my high street
I'm tangled in my
Lost your path
By hand
Ooh
Stronger now
There's nothing you can do
Turn around
Don't look back
Broke your spell
I'll never get me back
No chance to be
No chance to be
No chance to be
No chance to
I'm tangled in my heart string
I'm tangled in my heart string
I'm tangled in my dream
I'm tangled in my dream
I'm tangled in my dream
I'm tangled in my strings
No chance to be
No chance to be
No chance to be
