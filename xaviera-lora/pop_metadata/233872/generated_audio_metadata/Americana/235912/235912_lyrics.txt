It's a party on the bayou, let the good times roll
Etouffée and Zydeco
Crawfish bone and jambalaya in the pot
Don't worry about nothing that you've otten
It's a party on the bayou, let the good times roll
Et tu fais anxiety-co?
Profits more than jambalaya in the pot
Don't worry about nothing that you ot
Louisiana living, Louisiana ways
Cajun country calling all of your names
You ain't seen it all'til you see how it's done
Down in alligator country, having some fun
Grand Street Saturday night
Wait all week just to get it right
Little feet playing get you out on the floor
Can't sit down once you're through that door
Mama and Papa gotta come along
Waltzing and a poking and singing them songs
Everybody going gonna have a good time
Won't go home till morning light
It's a party on the bayou, let the good times roll
Etouffee and Zydeco
Crawfish, born and joined by lying in the pot
Don't worry about nothing that you ot
Louisiana living, Louisiana ways
Cajun country calling all of your names
Ain't seen it all'til you see how it's done
Down in alligator country, when they're having some fun
Oh, yay!
Rooving the skillet blue dog in the air
Zachary preaching KDN everywhere
Pulling those P-Rolls up to the door
Don't have to wait around in the mud no more
Lot of folks tell you that it all washed away
Ain't no place for you to come and play
But over in the swamp laying all around
The washboard scratching, zydecajun sounds
It's a party on the bayou, let the good times roll
Etouffee and Zydeco
Crop is boiling, jambalaya in the pot
Don't worry about nothing that you ot
Louisiana living in Louisiana ways
Cajun country calling all of your names
But ain't seen it all until you see how it's done
Down in alligator country, in there having some fun
It's a party on the bayou, let the good times roll
Pay to play, inside it go
Crawfish born and jump a lie in the pot
Don't worry about nothing that you ot
Louisiana living, Louisiana ways
Kitchen country calling all of your names
Ain't seen it all'til you see how it's done
Down in alligator country
When they're having some fun
It's a party on the bayou, let the guitars roll, et tu fais un sadico
Rockets falling, jambas high and the cops, don't worry'bout nothin' that you ot
Ouh, ouh, ouh, ouh, ouh, ouh, ouh, ouh, ouh
It's a party on the bayou, let the guitars roll, et tu fais un sadico
A bitch strong as I'm a lion in the park
Don't worry'bout nothin' but you
