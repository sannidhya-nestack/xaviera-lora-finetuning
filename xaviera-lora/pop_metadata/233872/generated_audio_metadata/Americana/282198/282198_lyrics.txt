I'm a rag doll, just a little rag doll
I'm looking for my Raggedy Andy
I'll find him at the lost and found
That's where he hangs around
He's a rag doll, just a little rag doll
Some folks say I'm not very pretty
my dress fits funny and my hair is frizzy
Rag doll, just a little rag doll
And when my great big button eyes look at him
I'm gonna love him, it ain't no whim
He's a rag doll, just a little rag doll
Maybe I walk too many a mile
I always did it with a smile
And I have never been in fashion
Feeling good is my only passion
I'm a ride-ah
Just a little ride-ah
Lookin' for my Raggedy Andy
I'll find him at the lost and found
That's where he hangs around
He's a rag doll
Just a little rag doll
And I am feelin' sweet as candy
Dancin' with my Raggedy Andy
We're rag dolls
Just little rag dolls
Just baby rag dolls
Little baby rag dolls
