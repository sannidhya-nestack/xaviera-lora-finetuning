Morning train is coming gone, looks like she wasn't on it
Her face still glowing red with scorn, you don't need to ask about it
Questions asked come never answered around this time of year
Gotta look round behind her head to see who's next out there
Some afternoons get cold as hell with frost to set them off
Walking barefoot down the glacier's path gets twice as tough
Darkness comes too early now that seasons start parading
Winter sun so weak and clouded over every day
Seems things got turned around
She'll search another town
Find herself a hideaway before they both go down
Her ghost still hears his cry
Though her body's above ground
A place to go when things get turned around
First he was her candy man, she was his sugar cane
She ends up running far and fast away from her own name
Every time he hears it tears him up like ripping wraps
Every mirror shows her face looking sad and sad
He rambled all around his world to see all he could see
Now he's got all that he can do to find a place to sleep
He'd wish she never meant the heartin' things she said
Some days he just pretends to dream still sleepin' in her bed
If only her intentions spoke it up a little louder
If her old ears had heard it better, up in her crystal tower
He takes that train and gets his due, he's leaving her the station
Waiting for the shoe to drop, ain't all that fascinating
He'll shame and taint whatever it is to suit his foolish pride
She'll be over yonder waiting for his next abide
I don't know nothing much except things got turned around
