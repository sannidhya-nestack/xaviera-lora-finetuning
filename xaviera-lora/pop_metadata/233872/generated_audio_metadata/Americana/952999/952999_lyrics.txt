Spinning round without my feet on the ground
Never knowing I'm gonna stop
I've been up, I've been down, I've been all over town
Kinda feel like I'm gonna drop
I don't know where I'm going but I know where I've been
But I kinda got a place in mind
Gonna put my head down and gonna look around
Gonna get there in a little time
Marjorie Jane, I kinda like her name
She got everything you'd ever want
She's hot and she's steamy
She's perfectly dreamy
She's a girl I really like a lot
I don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
But I kinda got a place in mind
Gonna put my head down
And gonna look around
Gonna get there in a little time
Give me a smile, let's ride another mile
And I can help you if you need a hand
I can sing you a song, I can pull you along
We can get to where we're going to
And we can get to where we're going to
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
