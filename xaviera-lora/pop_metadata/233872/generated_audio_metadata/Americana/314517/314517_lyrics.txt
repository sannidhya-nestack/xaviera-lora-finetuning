You used to be 39, now you're 30 old
You used to be a rolling stone, now you're getting mold
You're officially it has been, at least that much is clear
You are 40 and it's all downhill from here
A fire truck was radioed to help put out your cake
The heat was so intense they had to throw it in the lake
When people say you're looking good you wish they were sincere
You are forty and it's all downhill from here
'Cause you are forty, beyond the shadow of a doubt
You've hit the big four-o, your body's wearing out
You've climbed the highest mountain, now you're way beyond your prime
You are forty and you're on that great decline
You don't have any problems sleeping in a chair
Don't care about how often you change your underwear
The sex life that you used to have will shortly disappear
You are forty and it's all downhill from here
Your skin is tough as leather
Your face is looking drab
Your abs have disappeared into a great big massive flab
The only hair that you can grow is in your nose and ears
You are forty and it's all downhill from here
Cause you are forty
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
You've hit the big four-oh
Your body's wearing out
You've climbed the highest mountain, now you're way beyond your prime
You are forty and you're on that great deep line
'Cause you are 40
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
You've hit the big four-oh
Your body's wearing out
You've climbed that highest mountain
Now you're way beyond your prime
You are 40 and you're on that great decline
You are 40 and you're on that great decline
You are 40 and you're on that great decline
