I am not sleeping, I have not left
I am not beholden, I am not trapped
I come here willing, with hope and with grace
I'm all around you, joy in your space
And I've been waiting for so long to see a new day, to live a new dawn
And I've been waiting for so long to see new day, to live a new dawn
So I followed, I followed my breath
Surrendered my fear, over to death
And the world turned brighter, she lived and she bloomed
And I knew I was risen, I was not doomed
I've been waiting for so long
To see a new day
To live a new dawn
And I've been waiting for so long
To see a new day
To live a new dawn
I've been waiting for so long
To see a new day
To live a new dawn
I sing out to show you that now is the time
To inhale and celebrate, I've seen the signs
A new day, a new way to let love in show
The walls fall to the ground like Jericho
And I've been waiting for so long to see a new day
To live a new dawn
And I've been waiting for so long to see new day
To live a new dawn
I've been waiting for so long to see a new day, to live a new dawn
And I've been waiting for so long to live a new day, to see a new dawn
