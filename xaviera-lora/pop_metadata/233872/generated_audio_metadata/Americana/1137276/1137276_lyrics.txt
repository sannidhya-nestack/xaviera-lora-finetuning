I've got a goal at the head of the creek
Go and see about this town's a week
It's where magic, sweets and wine
Rifts off round like sweets in a van
Go on up Crip Creek, go and run
Go on up Crip Creek, have a little fun
Go on up Crip Creek, go on and walk
Go on up Crip Creek, see my goal
Golden creeper, it sure crawls
Jump on by like a dog on a ball
Grab my perch, search in my knees
Gonna wait on creeper when I sleep
Go on creeper, go on a run
Go on creeper, having fun
Go on creeper, go on a walk
Go on creeper, see my call
I'm going up the creek, going to run
Going up the creek, having fun
Going up the creek, going to whirl
Going up the creek, see my girl
