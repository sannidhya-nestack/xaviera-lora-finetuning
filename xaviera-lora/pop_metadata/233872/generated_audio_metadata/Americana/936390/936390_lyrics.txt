Buffalo girls won't you come out tonight, come out tonight, come out tonight
Buffalo girls won't you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon
As I was walking down the street, down the street, down the street
A pretty little girl I chance to meet under the silvery moon
Buffalo girls won't you come out tonight, come out tonight, come out tonight
Buffalo girls won't you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon
I asked this gal to be my wife, be my wife, be my wife
That I'd be happy all my life, skip to my loon, my darling
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight, come out tonight, come out tonight
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stockin'
And her heel kept rockin' and her heel kept rockin'
Now buffalo gals won't you come out tonight
And dance by the light of the moon
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight
Come out tonight, come out tonight
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight
And dance by the light of the moon
Buffalo girls, won't you come out tonight?
Come out tonight, come out tonight
Buffalo girls, won't you come out tonight and dance for the light of the moon?
