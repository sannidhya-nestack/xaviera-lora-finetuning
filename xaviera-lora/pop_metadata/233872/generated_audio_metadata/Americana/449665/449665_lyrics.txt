Well, there's fire in the spirit, blood in the holy wine (Holy, holy, holy, holy)

Hey, hey, yeah, what a revelation (what a revelation)
What a sacred sign when Jesus sat to wed and turned the water into wine

Glory hallelujah, he shined his light on me
Well, there's fire in the spirit, blood in the holy wine
