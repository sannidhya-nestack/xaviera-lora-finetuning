Or can it be, I'm at this creek again?
Only this time, I'm trying to decide
Oh if I should, I should step in
Oh our story's not yet told
Oh, but understand if I can't hold self back from you
Hold myself back from you
The voice is a melody, oh a sweet bell in my ears
For some time now, you're all I want to be near
Our stories are not yet told
But understand if I can't hold
A peck from you
Oh, you've stolen my heart
Enraptured my thoughts
Your love is all I need (your love is all I need)
Oh, what may this be (this be)
A love so sweet (a love so sweet)
You are my every dream
Please don't let my heart wrap to my thoughts
Your love is all I need, love is all I need
What may this be, but love is so sweet
You are my every dream
All our stories not yet told
Oh lord understand if I can't hold myself back for me
Hold myself back from you, back from you yeah
My soul burned from you, yeah
Oh, you stole my heart
And raptured my thoughts
Your love is all I need
Love is all I need
Oh, I made this beat
My love was so sweet
You are my everything
