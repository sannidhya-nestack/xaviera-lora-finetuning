We'll take away all the joys that bind us
And take away what is rightfully ours
And fill your house with ill-gotten fortune
And brick by brick we will take your house down
Take a man's right to earn his living and try to tie him down his soul
One day he'll rise from his bed of frustration and standing tall he will take it no more
Lift your heart to the great tomorrow
Now hold your head high, turn your face to the sun
Feel the wind rising from the east now
And fear no man for the day it has come
Don't cry, sweet child, from your smile we borrow
Fought to chew, fought to carry on
Lift your heart and write your tomorrow
This world is yours and your day it has come
Lift your heart to the great tomorrow
Now hold your head high, turn your face to the sun
Feel the wind rising from the east now
Now fear no man for the day it has come
