For it's very clear to see
What America means to me
It's my country, it's my home, it's my pride
It's a place for all to share
In all the bounty and all the fare
America, my country, proud and free
For I'm proud to be an American
I fight for the red, white and blue
From the oceans to the shores
All the battles, all the wars
America, my country, proud and free, yeah
For it's very clear to see
What America means to me
It's my country, it's my home, it's my pride
It's a place for all to share
In all the bounty and all the fare
America, my country, proud and free
For I'm proud to be an American
I fight for the red, white and blue
From the oceans to the shores
All the battles, all the wars
America, my country proud and free
America, my country, proud and free
Now we're home in all its grand
Living here in this great land
But there are those whose threats we can't ignore
No we can't
We must gather all our force
All our strength to stay the course
For freedom is well worth fighting for
For I'm proud to be an American
I fight for the red, white and blue
From the oceans to the shores
All the battles, all the wars
America, my country, proud and free
For I'm proud, proud to be an American
My colors are red, white and blue
From the East Coast to the West
North and South, we are the best
America, our country, we love you
America, we love you
