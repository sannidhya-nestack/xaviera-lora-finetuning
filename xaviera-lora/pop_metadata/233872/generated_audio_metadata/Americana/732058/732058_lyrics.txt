Name your poison
Name your prize
Name your children
After someone dies
Kiss your grandma
If she's around
Kiss their asses while they have you down
But you gotta get up off the ground, oh
Gotta get up off the ground
time won't wait for you now
Find a nice companion, find a nice house
Find a nice lawyer if it don't work out
Lose your patience, lose your friends
Lose your sanity, try to make amends
But you gotta get up off the ground boy
Gotta get up off the ground
time won't wait for you now
If two wrongs do not make the right
Maybe it takes three
Don't you know that being someone nice ain't the easiest way to be
I'll change your reasons
I'll change your vice
Change yourself back into someone nice
But you gotta get up off the ground boy
Gotta get up off the ground
You gotta get up off the ground boy
Gotta get up off the ground
Cause time won't wait for you
Time won't wait for you
Time won't wait for you now
The time won't wait for you now
The time won't wait for you now
The time won't wait for you
The time won't wait for you
The time won't wait for you now
