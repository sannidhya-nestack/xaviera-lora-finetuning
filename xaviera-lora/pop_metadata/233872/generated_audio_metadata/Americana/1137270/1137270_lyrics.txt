I don't want no high-pressure woman
Tell me where to be
Oh, I don't want no high-person woman
Tell me who to save
All night long, all night long
All night long
Make me feel me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She wanna poison my tea
Oh, she wanna poison my coffee
She wanna poison my tea
All night long, all night long, all night long
I've been drinking whiskey
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There's something I wanna tell you, but you don't know
There's something I want to tell you, what you're to know
I don't, I don't, I don't want no high pressure woman, oh no
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
(I'm gonna be a good man)
(I'm gonna be a good man)
(I'm gonna be a good man)
(I'm gonna be a good man)
(I'm gonna be a good man)
Oh, oh, oh
