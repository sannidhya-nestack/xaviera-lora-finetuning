You with the world upon your shoulder
Your tears they fell like icy rain
You
You're no wiser but you're older
But one day you'll fly
You'll fly away (one day)
You'll fly, you'll fly away
You, you were standing on the corner
Just trying, just trying to pass the time
Those days, those days are gone forever
But one day you'll fly, you'll fly away
One day you'll fly, you'll fly away
It used to be so easy for you
It's not so easy now
They used to dance when you called their names
But no one's dancing now, you
You gave away your freedom
No time, no time to say goodbye
Well the night is gonna be a cold one
But one day you'll fly, you'll fly away
One day you'll fly, you'll fly away
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
