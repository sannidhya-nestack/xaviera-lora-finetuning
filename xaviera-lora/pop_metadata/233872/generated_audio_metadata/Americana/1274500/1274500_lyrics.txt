Adieu, adieu, goodbye to you
Sadly the clock must start anew
Memories we had that went on dying
Adieu my love, goodbye
I'll do, I'll do, it was good knowing you
Your scent will stay with me the whole winter through
Commitments that cold lies to red jewel
I'll do you a sweeter than wine
We pass by chance along the boulevard, sir, may I just feel grateful I happen to be there?
We were both alone but in the wink of an eye
We became lovers and swore we couldn't die
Now we do, I do, for a time the residue
Of days and nights together will make us both feel blue
What was once familiar will seem cold and dry
Oh dear, my love, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Adieu, adieu, how many times for you?
My train is bored and your friends are waiting you
Like delicate sweet night exposed to cruel day
Adieu, remember me, silver playhead
When we first kissed it felt like the first time
Feelings we had for others they stopped all the time
We built a dream world that wasn't meant to last
We woke the last morning it came crashing down at last
Adieu, adieu, goodbye to you, sadly the clock
More startling new memories we had
That will not die
Hug to my love goodbye
Hug to my love goodbye
Hug to my love goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye, oh goodbye
