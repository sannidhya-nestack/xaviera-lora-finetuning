Home, I'm a coming home
Back to where my heart belong
Blacktop road, I'm on my way
Tell my love, I'm a gonna stay
Where old Molly flow
Ooh, where cypress grow
Where the cottons hide
Brush in late summer skies
Home, I gotta get home
Back from where my memories come
When I reach familiar shores
Then my heart will ache no more
Where song of hummingbirds
In the morning stone is heard
Where the nightingale's roamed
Here I'm coming home
Spanish moles
Trace on that southern breeze
Floats on that salmon oar wind
Like those memories of home
Home, I'm a coming home
Back to where my heart belong
Blacktop road, I'm on my way
Tell my love, I'm a gonna stay home
I'm a coming home
Back from where my memories come
When I reach familiar shores
Then my heart will ache no more
Home, I'm coming home
Home
Back to where
My heart belong
My heart belong
Home
Strange voice
Sways on that southern breeze
Strange voice
Place on my soul, please
