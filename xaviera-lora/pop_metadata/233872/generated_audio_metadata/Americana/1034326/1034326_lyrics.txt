From the four corners they came
Looking for the golden streets
Stepped ashore on Ellis Island
Strange land beneath their feet
Was sold the dream of a new life
In this land of the free
To plant a new generation
Of every colour, every creed
These are the hands that built America
Laid the foundation stone
This is the soul of America
And they call this land their own
From the east coast to the west
They built the cities, worked the farms
Have to fight for every dime
Weathered every storm
They kept the dream alive
Though many stones were thrown
Just the same as any man
They want a place to call their own
These are the hands that built America
Laid the foundation stone
This is the soul of America
And they call this land their own
And all the sights and all the sounds of America
From Little Italy to Chinatown
We're still reaching for the dream of America
And I believe that it's still there to be found
These are the hands that built America
Laid the foundation stone
This is the soul of America
And they call this land their own
These are the hands that built America
Laid the foundation stone
This is the dream of America
We call this land our home
