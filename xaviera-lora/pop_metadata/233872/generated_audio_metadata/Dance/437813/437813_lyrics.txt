I wanna show you what you mean to me
I'd like to get together and go for a ride
And make it happen
today we'll meet some friends along the way
Come on and let the music play
We'll be dancing all night long
So let me rock with you
Making sweet love and feeling strong
So let me rock
Here we are now
Losing our minds
We can make this come alive and do it right
So let's make a promise
To realize
Our dreams along the way
Come on and let the music play
Dancing all night long
So let me rock with you
Making sweet love and feeling strong
Rock, rock with you
Who knows what we'll chance upon
When I am rocking with you
Don't hold still we're moving on
So let me rock
And we'll be dancing all night long
So let me rock with you
Making a sweet love and feeling strong
Rock, rock with you
Who knows what we'll chance upon
When I am rocking with you
Don't hold still, we're moving on (Slowly walk)
My love will get through (it will get through honey)
So let it come down to you (down to you baby)
Down to you (down, down, down to you baby)
Walk with you (I wanna, I wanna, I wanna walk with you, baby)
No hostile way (oh yeah)
All night long, all night long
All night long, all night long, all night long
I wanna rock with you baby, rock with you
Oh, I wanna rock with you baby, oh
Oh baby
Down to you, down to you
