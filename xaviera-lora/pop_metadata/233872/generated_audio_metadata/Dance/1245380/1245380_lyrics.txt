Underneath the windows we're hiding from the world
City lights reflected as the night unfolds
In this little haven it's just you and me
Lost in our own illusions but wild and free
I'll be racing your touch like fire
Every moment with you takes me higher
In the haste of the night we're breaking through
Misty wind, it's just me and you
Feeling the secrets in the rain
Fading shadows, let's do it all again
In the fog each twilight knows a sweet escape
See, we're less matter of passage and just a shade
Raindrops on the glass, they're writing our song
In the silence, we've been here all along
Every glance and whisper, a story to be told
In the misty windows, I lost your call
I'll be racing, you'll touch like fire
Every moment with you takes me higher
In the haze of the night we're breaking through
Misty windows, just me and you
Doing the secrets in the rain
Facing shadows, let's do it all again
In the foggy twilight, love's a sweet escape
Misty windows where our hearts did shake
Underneath the moonlight, our dreams are so bright
In the misty windows, everything's alright
We're painting the night with every breath we take
In this world of wonder, we'll never break
Follow me through moonlight
Dreams will go by
In the misty windows everything's alright
We're painting the night with every breath we take
In this world of wonder we'll never fade
Misty windows secrets in the rain
Dancing shadows let's do it all again
In the foggy twilight, love's the sweetest game
Misty windows where our hearts take shape
City lights fading, but the moment's staying
Misty windows, when we're like the light
Having had forever, we'll never let go
Misty windows, our love will always glow
