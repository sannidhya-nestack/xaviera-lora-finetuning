Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-nay, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-nai, na-na-na-na-na
Painted signs on the avenue blow
Every step feels faster than slow
We don't chase we just collide
In this rhythm we can't hide
Every secret's breaking through
Every road is leading to you
Take me into the blue
Where the world feels wide and the pulse is true
Every breath is something new
I'm alive, I'm alive into the blue
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na-na, na, na, na, na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Silver lines on the glass unfold
Every glance is brighter than gold
We're electric, wide awake
Every moment ours to take
Every secret's breaking through
Every road is leading to you
Take me into the blue
Where the world feels wide and the pulse is true
Every breath is something new
I'm alive, I'm alive into the blue
We rise, we move, we break away
No chains, no walls, nothing left to wear
It's here, it's us, it's shining through
Forever starts in the shade of blue
Take me into the blue
Where the world feels wide and the pulse is true
Every breath is something new
I'm alive, I'm alive into the blue
Into the blue
I'm alive, I'm alive into the blue
