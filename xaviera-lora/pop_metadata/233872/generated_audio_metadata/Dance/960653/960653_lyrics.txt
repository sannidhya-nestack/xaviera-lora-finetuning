Bang on I hear the drums
Dance on the feeling comes
So true the mystery
So long I need to be inside
Hang on, I hear the drums
Dance on the feeling of
So true a mystery
So long I need to be inside
Come with me
Lie to me
Love to see
Forever
Rescue me from destruction
I'm gonna lose it
I'm gonna get down
I'm gonna run free
I'm gonna break out
I am free
I am free of you, I'm losing you, I'm losing you
I am free, I am free of you
