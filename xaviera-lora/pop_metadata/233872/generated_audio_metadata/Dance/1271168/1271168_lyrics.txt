We could keep it here
I won't disappear'til you catch me in
Don't wanna interfere
You try to make it weird but you can't see
So simple
You got me twisted around in my fingers
Till you come any closer
I know what you want from me
You don't need a promise I will keep
We'll fall apart and call it destiny
Not meant to be
But if I believe
You're the one for me
You're the one for me
You're all I need
You're the one for me
Oh no
Now I'm tangled in my thoughts can't push up how I feel
But we don't have to talk to know the truth
So simple, you got me twisted around your finger
Don't come any closer
I know what you want from me
You don't need a promise I won't keep
We'll fall apart and call it destiny
Not meant to be
But if I believe
Oh no
You don't need a promise I won't keep
We'll fall apart and call it destiny
Oh no
Not meant to be
But if I believe
You're the one for me
You're the one for me
You're all I need
You're the one for me
You're the one for me
You're the one for me
You're all I need
You're the one for me
