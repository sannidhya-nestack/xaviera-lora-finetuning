I'm back in my home, people
And everything good to come
What are we like, setting our sights
On pushing out the sun
We don't need the gold, the Zagreb
On flight 472
Pushed to the back
Wearing a dress in black
It's just what I'm gonna do
We're the right on people
Moving into town tonight
We rely on love
To see us through it
We rely on people
Living in the world tonight
We rely on love
Every new day
You don't wanna miss the city
It sure would be a pity
Best swing by on a red hot night
When everything's getting good
We the right old people
Moving in town tonight
We rely on love to see us through it
We're the right old people living in the world tonight
We rely on love every new day
I guess more or less
All good things will pass
No looking back
Into the black
With everyone
Everyone
Everyone
We rely on people moving in town tonight
We rely on love to see us through it
We rely on people living in the world tonight
We rely on love
Every move that I make (We rely on love)
We rely on love (We rely on love)
We're the right on people (We're the right on people)
