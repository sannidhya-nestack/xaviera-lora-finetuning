Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the breeze of the night
You're scent in the air
Remembering your fragrance
Takes me back there
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Soft whispers in the dark
Flowers in sweet wine
Lost in the memory
Wish you were mine
All the scent I can't et
Your touch lingers yeah
In my mind you're still here
Freedom swipes away the fear
Candles burn slowly
Mixing shadows and light
In the echoes of your essence
Thonging through the night
Every breath a memory
Every kiss, a dream
Remembering your fragrance
Lost in the in between
Oh, all the scent I can't et
Your touch lingers yet
In my mind you're still here
Fragrance wipes away the fear
Every breath a memory
Every kiss a dream
Remembering your fragrance
Lost in the in between
All the scent I can't et
Your touch lingers yet
In my mind you're still here
Fading twice away in fear
