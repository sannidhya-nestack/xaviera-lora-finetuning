One day in the earth I'll listen the sound
I hope you find it and never will last
I calling about you, I calling you
My dear I found you, I promise improve
I promise improve, I promise improve
I promise improve
Hey, don't care when it's incomplete
For me being young and muscle of creating
I lost you but don't et you
I miss you a lot of time come back home
Hey, don't care when it's incomplete
For me being young and muscle of creating
I lost you, but don't et you
I miss you, a lot of time, come back home
Person, person
Why are you so?
Why are you so?
Why are you so?
Reason
Reason
Reason
So many words haven't been told to you
I hope to see you very soon
So many words haven't been told to you
I hope to see you very soon
Very soon
Very soon
Rare songs, rare songs, rare songs, rare songs, rare songs
Hey, don't care when it's uncompleted
For maybe I'm a muscle of creating
I lost you but don't et you
I miss you a lot of time come back home
Hey, don't care, don't care, don't care
Hey, don't care, don't care, don't care
Hey, don't care
Don't care
Why so?
Why so?
