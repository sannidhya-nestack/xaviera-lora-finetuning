Look in my eyes and see the burning flame
One thousand heartbeats like the floor
Feels like a storm is rushing through my veins
A passion so strong cannot ignore
Understand there's no one else I need her
Seduction way beyond it drives me wild
Never once before I did desire
Now I'll walk the earth and search for
I call the name
I'm driving in the rain
Nothing can I change
As I look into my heaven
And I never felt such gain
My eyes are pouring rain
Can I handle this desire?
Desire
Look in my eyes and see the burning flame
One thousand heartbeats like the floor
Understand there's no one else I need, her
Seduction way beyond it drives me wild
Never once before I did desire
Now I walk the earth and search for
I call her name
I'm driving in the rain
Nothing can I change as I look into my heaven
And I never felt such gain
My eyes are pouring rain
Can I handle this desire?
Desire
Desire
