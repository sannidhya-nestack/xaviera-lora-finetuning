I feel so fine when you look into my eyes
Try to keep my cool tonight
Just promise that you'll do me right
You can keep me going'cause I like your style
And I want your body close to me
Got you in my room for another night
I could give you everything you need
Can I call you señorita?
Can I say de bonita?
When I'm lying underneath ya
Messin' all the sheets up
Keep all the lights down low
When I call you señorita
Keep on keepin' right, down low, little left
Keep on keepin' right, down low
'Cause you're so fly, still taste your lips
Oh my, we can burn it up
So fine, just promise that you'll do me right
You can keep me going'cause I like your style
And I want your body close to me
Got you in my room for another night
I can give you everything you need
Can I call you senorita?
Can I say "damponita"?
When I'm lying underneath ya
Messin' all the sheets up
Keep all the lights down low
When I call you senorita
Goodbye, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodbye, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
