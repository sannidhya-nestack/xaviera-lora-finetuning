Sunrise breaking through the haze
Golden lights lose my face
Words are calling my name
I feel wild, can't be tamed
Sand between my toes so free
Ocean breeze sings to me
Laughter echoes in the air
Everywhere it disappears
Summer shimmering sun
Every day's a white run
Underneath the sky so blue
Dreams and wishes all come true
So high when night arrives
Stars that ignite in your eyes
Dancing'til morning light
Love and laughter shining bright
Splashing in the crystal sea
Time is lost so carefree
Heartbeat sink with the tide
In this moment we could fight
So much humor in the sun
Every day's a white run
Underneath the skies so blue
Dreams and wishes all come true
Dreams and wishes all come true
Summer shimmering sun
Every day's a wire run
Underneath this castle blue
Dreams and wishes all come true
Bonfire when the night arrives
Stars ignite in your eyes
Dancing to the morning light
Love and laughter shining bright
Splashing in the crystal sea
Time is lost so carefree
Heartbeat syncs with time
In this moment we could find
Summer shimmer in the sun
Every day's a wild one
Underneath the sky so blue
Dreams and wishes all come true
Dreams and wishes all come true
Flourish in the rain, sir
Every day's a wild one
Underneath the sky so blue
