I see you wandering
Searching for the sun
Outside it's thundering
A reflection of my mind
I never knew
That I was hurting you before
Hurting you before
Couldn't see through
I couldn't see you through the storm, see you through the storm
This blurry mind condition only lets me focus on what it wants
If you got left behind then I want you to know
That it wasn't nothing personal, Mr. Bloody Mars
Mr. Blurry Mind
Mr. Blurry Mind
Mr. Blurry Mind
I see you under it
Searching for the signs
Outside it's thunderous
A reflection of my mind
Mr. Blurry Mind
