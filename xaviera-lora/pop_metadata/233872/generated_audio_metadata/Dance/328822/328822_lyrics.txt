Everything's got to have a shade of grey
Don't know why it's got to be that way
You're cheerful and smiling
But something still rattles your brain
Right on time, call again my name
Bitter with the sweet
Bitter with the sweet
Bitter with the sweet, bitter with the sweet
Wonder how can you be so alone
Tell me what excites you all alone
Creating a world is as simple as making a friend
Tell me why are you so different?
Bitter with the sweet
Bitter with the sweet
Bitter with the sweet
Bitter with the sweet
Everything's got to have a shade of grey
Bitter with the sweet
Bitter with the sweet
Bitter with the sweet
Bitter with the sweet
Bitter with the sweet
Bitter with the sweet
Bitter with the sweet
