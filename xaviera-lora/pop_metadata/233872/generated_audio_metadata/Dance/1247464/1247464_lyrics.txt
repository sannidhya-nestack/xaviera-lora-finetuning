In the spotlight, there's drug and power
A queen on the runway, there's never a doubt
Fashion lights, designer clothes
But when I'm with you, oh, the world slows
You see the girl behind the fake, you call my name
And it's not the same
With every step and every glance you make my heart dance in a sweet romance
I'm a murderer on the stage but with you I'm out of this cage
We laugh and love no need to grow in your arms my true self show
Behind the curtain when the show's done
I'm your girl, you're my only one
No more makeup, no more mask
Just your love, that's all I ask
You see the girl behind the fake call my name
And it's not the same
With every step and every glance
You make my heart dance
In a sweet romance
I'm a mongrel on the stage
But with you all out of this cage
We laugh and love, no need to grow
In your arms like true self show
Behind the curtain the show will start
I'm your girl if you're my only one
No more makeup no more mask
Just your love that's all I ask
Deeper passion lights I may seem so tall
But it's your love that makes me feel it all
In your eyes I see my true reflection
In your love I find my perfection
I'm a model on the stage
But with you I'm out of this cage
We laugh and love no need to pose
In your arms my true self shows
So here's to us my lost soul
In this dance of life it's me, yeah
From the runway to a little world
You're the love that makes this girl float, ooh
So here's to what's my love so true
In this dance of life it's me and you
From the runway to our little world
You're the love that makes this girl twirl
