City light, shine like celestial flame
Is beckoning us to this nocturnal game
The streets pulse with an electric vibe
This vibrant energy we can't deny
We surrender to the rhythm tonight
Let the beat consume us with its light
Escape reality, leave worries behind
True freedom found when bodies are alike
Basslines rumble with seismic might
Melodies soar, take us to new heights
We move as one transcendent tribe
Intoxicated by music's delight
We surrender to the rhythm tonight
Let the beat consume us with its light
Escape reality, leave worries behind
The true freedom found when bodies all align
We surrender to the rhythm tonight
Let the beat consume us with its light
Escape reality, leave worries behind
True freedom found when bodies align
As dawn breaks, break this blissful spell
The night's magic forced memories to dwell
Indelible marks of passion unchanged
A rebirth, our existence forever
As dawn's rays break this blissful spell
The night's magic ed memories to dwell
Indelible marks of passion unchanged
A rebirth, our existence forever
