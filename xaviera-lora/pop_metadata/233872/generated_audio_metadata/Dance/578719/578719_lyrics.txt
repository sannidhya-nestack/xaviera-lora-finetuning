I'm out of time, while breathing in, my head still spins
Like carbon dioxide
You can smell the sin
It will drench your skin
Oh woah oh woah oh woah
When you're on the battle
You know you're gonna lose the war
Oh woah oh woah oh woah
It doesn't really matter
ot what I am fighting for
I'm fighting love
Yeah yeah yeah
You saved my heart
But look what am I, it's my love (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You saved my heart
But look what am I, it's my love
I knew it from the start
I guess you saved my heart
But didn't stop the bleeding of my love (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You saved my heart
With a preemptive strike, you turn lose to win
Destiny unfulfilled, lost between black and white
The end begins with a Judas kiss
You took the sacred apple, stabbed it till you hit the core
My mind just popped and crackled'til I couldn't take no more
I am done (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You saved my heart (ay)
But look what I'm on is my love (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You saved my heart
But love undermines my love
I knew it from the start
I guess you saved my heart
But didn't stop the bleeding of my love
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
You saved my heart
But love undermines my love
My heart has been taken
Defenses are breaking
Please don't let me hate you
And don't let me et
I'm a mess, I feel lost and cuffed
How could I know you suck my love like love? (Suck my love like love) (Suck my love like love)
You saved my heart
But look what I'm I, it's my love
You saved my heart (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
But look what I'm on is my love
I knew it from the start
I guess you saved my heart
But didn't stop the bleeding of my love
You saved my heart, yeah yeah yeah yeah
But look what I'm on is my love, yeah yeah yeah yeah
You saved my heart
You saved my heart
But look what my smile owes
You saved my heart
You saved my heart
But look what my smile owes
