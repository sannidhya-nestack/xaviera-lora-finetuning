On the road we've got a ways to go
Switching lanes I can't regain control
Can't turn around I've got no place to go
So let's get lost, take off, grab a hold
Chase the sun, ride the wind, race the rain
Find something new, break the rules, erase the pain
Let's go too fast, don't look back, find a lane
Pedal down, look around, it's just us
I wanna drive'til our hearts crash
Racing so fast, hold on love
Up in the sky
In the moonlight
Right by your side
I'll drive all night
Shift gears and slow it down, love
So far from where we were
There's nothing else around us
Now the best is just to blur
Chase the sun, ride the wind, race the rain
Find something new, break the rules, erase the pain
Let's go too fast, don't look back, find a lane
Peddle down, look around, it's just us, I'm gonna drive
our hearts crash, racing so fast, hold on love
Up in the sky, in the moonlight
Right by your side, I'll drive all night
Let's pretend it won't end
Let's pretend it won't end
Let's pretend, let's pretend, let's pretend, let's pretend
It won't end
I wanna drive into a heart's crash
Racing so fast, hold on love
Up in the sky, in the moonlight
Right by your side, I'll drive all night
I wanna drive,'til my heart's crashed
Racing so fast, hold on love
Up in the sky, in the night, in the moonlight
Right by your side, I'll drive all night
