Disco ball shining bright
Dance floor lights flash all night
Roll to the rhythm right
Electrify, stay fly
Feet moving fast and free
Boogie down feel the spring
Energy's wild and clean
In this disco city
Disco, fresco, all delight
Get up, dance and pump the nightlight
Colorful space in my sight
Feel the love tonight
DJ stand in the tune
Underneath that silver moon
Voices in unison grew
In this vivid filter room
Shake, shake, feel the heat
Lights up high on the beat
Does the heart skip a beat
Groove from the nose to feet
Disco, fresco, I delight
Trip up, dance into the daylight
Converse, blazing out of sight
Feel the lights ignite
Distress spinning the tomb
Underneath the silver moon
Voices in unison crew
And it's live and feel good
Shake shake feel the heat
Lights up high already
Disco hearts get the beat
Groove from the nose to feet
Disco frisco I delight
Get up, dance until daylight
Colors blazing out of sight
Feel the love in the night
