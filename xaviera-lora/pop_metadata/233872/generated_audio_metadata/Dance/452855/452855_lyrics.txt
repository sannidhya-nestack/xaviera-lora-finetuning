I'm running without moving
Racing the surge of waves flooding my head
Dare to defy my inner screams
I take a breath, hoping man's broken seams
I'm surfing the wind, flying above
I'm surfing the wind with wings of our love
The world is my nest when you are with me
We're slurping the weed and calming the seas
Unkept by the summer
Caressed by the wind next to you, I'm wrapped up
Troubles dissolve and look smaller from here
I look to the sun, feel your lips on my cheek
I'm surfing the wind, flying above
I'm surfing the wind with wings of our love
The world is my nest when you are with me
We're surfing the wind and calming the sea
I stumbled through waves, got dumped by the sea, lost in life's swell
I struggle to breathe when it's pulling me in
I saw higher above, right in the sky
I'm surfing the wind
Flying above
I'm surfing the wind
With wings of our love
I'm surfing the wind, flying above
I'm surfing the wind, with wings of our love
The world is my nest when you are with me
We're surfing the wind and calming the seas
Flying above, I'm surfing the wind with wings of our love
