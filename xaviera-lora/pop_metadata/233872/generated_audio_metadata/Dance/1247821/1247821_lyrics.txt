You and me, a perfect spark
Dancing close and feeling hot
In this groove, we'll never part
Sun sets low but we shine bright
Living neon every night
Hold me tight, we take off light
Magnetic love, we can't define
You and I, electrified
Pulling close, we touch the sky
Heartbeat thumping to the bass
In this dance we find a place
Time stands still in your embrace
Feel the rhythm feel the beat
Move our bodies to the heat
In this moment we're complete
Magnetic love we can't defy
You and I electrify
Holding close we touch the sky
Let it go off, we can't defy
You and I electrify
Pulling close, we touch the sky
Heartbeat, up into the bass
In the stands, we've tied our trains
Time stands still and no embrace
Feel the rhythm, feel the beat
Move our bodies through the heat
In this moment we're complete
Magnetic love, we can't define (define)
You and I, electrified
Pulling close, we touch the sky
Magnetic love, we can't define
You and I, electrified
Pulling for us, we touch the skies
