Darling, find me, find me before you go, morning
So burn me up before you go
Don't let my love hold you back
Don't let my tears be your scars
We built this house out of glass
We built these realms with broken hearts
You've got a lot on your mind
So you can't just walk away love
Woah
Feels like we've been here before
Just waiting for the break love
Just waiting for the
Just waiting for the break
Just waiting for the
Just waited for the break
Just waited for the break
Just waited for the break
Just waited for the break
Just waited for the break
Passion
Drive me, drive me into the night
Slowly
You give me up into the night
Don't let my love hold you back (Don't let my love hold you back)
Don't let my tears be your sky (Don't let my tears be your sky)
We built this house out of glass (We built this house out of glass)
We built these traps with broken hearts
You've got a lot on your mind
So you can't just walk away love
Woah
Feels like we've been here before
Just waiting for the break love
Just waiting for the
Just waiting for the break
Just waiting for the
Just waiting for the break break (I've been waiting for)
Just waiting for the break (I've been waiting for the break)
Just waiting for the break (I've been waiting)
Just wait a bit
Just wait a bit, wait a bit
Wait a little bit, wait a bit
Wait a little bit, wait a bit
