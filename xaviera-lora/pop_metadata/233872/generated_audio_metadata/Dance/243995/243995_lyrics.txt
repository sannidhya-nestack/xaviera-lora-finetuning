Now they kiss the seven wishes, run away as they are wishes
Spread your wings and fly away meet me past the dawn of day
Crossing the Atlantic, I'm just swimming in my little baby
Hiding in the sand, I'm running far away
Catch me if you can
Can you touch all of my feet?
Don't hesitate when I can beat you
Strengthen my heart
And change you
Catch me as your feet kick in, as I run over you
Catch me as your feet kick in
If you don't love me
If you don't love
Keep you by the other side of lost time
