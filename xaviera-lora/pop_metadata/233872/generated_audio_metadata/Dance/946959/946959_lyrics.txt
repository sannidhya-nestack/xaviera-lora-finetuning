Hey, let me speak to you in your own way
Hey, let me speak to you in your own way
Hey, let me speak to you in your own, way
Hey, let me speak to you in your own day
You say you love me when you are alone
But when you are fine you don't need my love
I have to stop going back to you
Back to you, back to you
You say you love me when you are alone
But when you are fine you don't need my love
I have to stop going back to you
Back to you, back to you
I never learned how to get away now
I never realized that you never fell in love
I had to escape, I'm prisoner, now run away
You say you're really fine, I wanna change a thing
I can't ignore this feeling inside of me
My heart beats so fast when you walk around
You walk around, hey, hey
You say you love me when you are alone
But when you are fine, you don't need my love
I have to stop going back to you
Back to you, back to you
Back to ya, back to ya
Back to ya, back to ya
You say you love me when you are alone
But when you are fine you don't need my love
I have to start going back to you
Back to you, back to you
You say you love me when you are alone
But when you are fine you don't need my love
I have to start going back to you
Back to you, back to you
I never know how to get away now
I never realized that I never fell in love
I have to escape, I'm prisoner, now run away
You say you're really fine, I wanna change a thing
I can't deny this feeling inside of me
My heart beats so fast when you walk around
You walk around, hey, hey
You say you like being when you are alone
But when you are fine, you don't need my love
I have to stop going back to ya
Back to ya, back to ya
Back to ya, back to ya (back to ya, back to ya)
Back to ya, back to ya (back to you, back to ya)
