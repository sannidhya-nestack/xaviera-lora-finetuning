I need to fight it, move up, we're on the wall
Dancing through the city lights, feeling high
We're gonna have a blast, no need to ask why
Drinks in our hands
Feeling high, we're gonna have it last
No need to ask why
Dreams in our hands, feeling the groove
Music pumping, can't help but move
Turning heads, causing a scene, living in the moment
Live in the dream
Tonight we're gonna dance, we're gonna shout
Let's go out and show them what we're about
We'll paint the town with our neon lights
It's gonna be a wild ride, no need to fight
Cruising down the street, can't control the beat
Feeling so alive in the midnight heat
Neon lights flashing like a symphony
Windows down, music loud, it's just you and me
Pedal to the floor, no need to hesitate
The night is ours, no need to wait
Leaving all our worries, leaving them behind
Letting go of everything, free our minds
Midnight drive, three hour life
Every single night, on the city lights
In the summer smoke, feel so alive
