Light up the night
And feeling so high
And we loving life
And it's alright
Light up the night
And I'm feeling so high
Cause we loving life
And it's alright
And it's alright
And it's alright
Light up the night
And feeling so high
We love in life
And it's alright, and it's alright
Light up the night
And feeling so high
And we loving life
And it's alright (and it's alright)
It's alright
Turn off the light and light up the night
Feeling so high
Loving life
It's alright
And I turn off the light
And it's alright
And it's alright
And it's alright
