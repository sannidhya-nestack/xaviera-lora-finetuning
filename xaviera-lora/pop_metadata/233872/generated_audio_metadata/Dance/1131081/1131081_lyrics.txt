Don't you go, don't you go, don't go nowhere
Because don't you go, don't you go, don't go nowhere
Because don't you go, don't you go, don't go nowhere
We're dry, don't you know
Don't you go, don't go nowhere, be gone
Don't you go, don't you go, don't go nowhere, be gone
Don't you go, don't you go, don't go nowhere, be gone
