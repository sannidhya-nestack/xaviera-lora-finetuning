You can take me to the stars
We can touch the stars tonight
You can take me to the stars
We can touch the stars tonight
Under the moonlit sky we shall turn
A star for each moment we have shared
Tonight's the night for new beginnings
We feel it together
Come bring your spirit in this time now we collide
You can take me to the stars
We can touch the stars tonight
You can take me to the stars
We can touch the stars tonight
Gotta feel it, be it, take it with you, catch the star tonight
Gotta feel it, be it, take it with you, catch the star tonight
Gotta feel it, be it, take it with you, catch the star tonight
Gotta feel it, be it, take it with you, catch the star tonight
You can take me to the stars
We can touch the stars tonight
You can take me to the stars
You can take me to the stars
We can touch the stars tonight
You can take me to the stars
We can touch the stars tonight
