I can almost taste your lips, I can almost shake your hips
I can almost hear that sound
I can always be the fool, you can always keep your cool
We can always mess around
you got something I heard, it's a four syllable word
Starts with V and ends in night
She's a fortune girl
She's driving me wild
She's a fortune doll
Got me off for long
She's a fortune girl
She's driving me wild
She's a fortune doll
Got me off for long
I can almost taste your lips
I can almost shake your hips
I can almost hear that sound
I can always be the fool
You can always keep your cool
We can always mess around
Cause you got something I heard
It's a false set of love or what?
Starts with the end and ends tonight
She's a fortune girl
She's driving me wild
She's a fortune doll
Got love for long
She's a fortune girl
She's driving me wild
She's a fortune doll
Got love for long
