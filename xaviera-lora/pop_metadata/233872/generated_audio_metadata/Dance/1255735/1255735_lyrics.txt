Waves crash, sun shines
Feet in the sand, feels fine
The ocean song, in my ear
All my worries disappear
Shining stones, gleam bright
Lives and kids, pure delight
Seagulls fly, skies clear
Love this place, never fear
One day at the beach, feeling so free
One day at the beach, just you and me
Build castles, feel strong
Holding hands, where we belong
Cats in the air, so high
Under this blue, endless sky
Born fight a night, stars glow
Stories told, and we're sure
Sweet moments, hearts tight
Perfect day, perfect night
One day on the beach, feeling so free
One day on the beach, just you and me
One day I'm a bitch, feeling so free
One day I'm a bitch, just you and me
