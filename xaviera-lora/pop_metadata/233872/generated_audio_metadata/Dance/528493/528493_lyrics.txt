One day here, the next day gone
How did it end? What went wrong?
I look around, I can't believe that you're gone
I do my best of moving on
I try to et what went wrong
It don't matter, you're still gone
Remind me of the times we walked along
Your hand in mine
Remind me of the days I was so sure they'd never go away
Remind me of the times we walked along
Your hand in mine, remind me of the days
I was so sure they'd never go away
One day here, the next day gone
How did it end, what went wrong
I look around, I can't believe
That you're gone
Reminded me
Of the times we walked along
Your hand in mine
Remind me of the days
I was so sure they'd never go away
Remind, remind me
Remind, remind me
Remind me
Of the times we walked along
Your hand in mine
Remind me of the days
I was so sure they'd never go away
Remind me of the times we walked along
Your hand in mine
Remind me of the days
I was so sure they'd never go away
Remind me
Remind, remind me
