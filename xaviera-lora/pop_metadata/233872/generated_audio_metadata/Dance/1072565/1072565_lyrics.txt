Things are not working
But you don't even care
Oh you mean nothing
I see it in your eyes
What can I do if you're in my head
I've been thinking about you all day
I've been so need you to explain me
Baby I just need to understand
Why can't you stay
Tell me how can I do if you live in my head
Tell me where should I go if you don't come with me
Tell me how can I do if you live in my head
Tell me what you like of you don't go with me
What can I do if you're in my head
I've been thinking about you all day
I've been so need you to explain me
Baby I just need to understand
What can you say
Tell me how can I do if you live in my head
Tell me where should I go if you don't come with me
Tell me how can I do if you live in my head
Tell me, would you like it if you don't go with me?
