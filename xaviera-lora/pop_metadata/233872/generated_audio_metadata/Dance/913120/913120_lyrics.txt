Yeah, I see you, you don't see me
Look into my eyes
The sky has gone, turned its back on me
Look into my eyes
You give me good, good, good love
Look into my eyes
You give me good, good, good love
Look into my eyes
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Look into my eyes
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Look into my eyes
You give me good good good love
Look into my eyes
You give me good good good love
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes
