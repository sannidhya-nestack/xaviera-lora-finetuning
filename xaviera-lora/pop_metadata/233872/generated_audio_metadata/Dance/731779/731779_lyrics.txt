I see you moving, you coming close to me
We're on a party and having fun tonight
You feel my loving, it's in the air tonight
Just fall in love with me and smile
We draw the limit, you coming close to me
You're coming over, our bodies will be free
You want more with, I'm what you want to go with me
To endless fun baby
I jump in the fire for you girl
I jump in the fire for you baby
I'll send my power
Will take me on the road
That leads the way baby
And baby baby stay
I just wanna play
Play the love game
Baby say your name
I know we feel the same
Move it up stop
Clap your hands and rock like this
Pump it up and don't stop
Doing it good all up from the hood
Move it and all around to the groove
Love as much as we as you can
Be strong as a hurricane yeah
Living up to the top
Never stop
Cry no more on the floor
Just once more yeah
I wanna be with my love, be with my dawg
Rock to the beat, rock to the beat
Stay with my sweet
Stay with my sweet T
