Under neon lights we move as one
Heartbeat sinking up the nights begun
In the rhythm we find our release
Dancing till the dawn a sweet release
Feel the baseline let it take control
In this moment we're unstoppable
No more worries just the beat and glow
Come on let your body flow
We're chasing starlight, dancing through the night
Lose ourselves in the sound
Let the music take us higher, higher
Shine so bright, echoes in the night
Feel around, feel the world surround
Let the rhythm be our fire, fire
City's pulse alive, we're intertwined
Every step and sync our spirits climb
Lost in melodies, we close our eyes
Dreaming wide awake, no compromise
Feel the baseline, let it take control
In this moment, we're unstoppable
No more worries, just the beat and glow
Come on, let your body flow
We're chasing starlight, dancing through the night
Move ourselves in sound, let the music take us higher, higher
Shines so bright, echoes in the night
Feel the world, move us all around
Can never be a fire, fire
Every move and each swing we're electric
In this dance we're connected magnetic
