Overpouring different somethings in the air
Taking paths less travelled with a daily flare
In a world of echoes I find my own frame
Living life in colour gold against the grain
Against the grain where we stand tall
In the face of doubt we won't fall
Every step of both can pain
Living life against the grain
Whispers in the shadows, voices in my ear
Telling me to follow but I see it clear
Breaking through the silence in the pouring rain
In the heart of chaos, cold and disagreeing
There's a grain where we stand tall
In the face of doubt we won't fall
Every step a bold campaign
Living life against the grain
In the fire, we find our light
In the struggle, we ignite
Every moment, we'll remain
Strong and free against the grain
Calling of a future with each passing day
In a world of black and white we find our way
In the rhythm of our heartbeat hear the golden frame
Breathing loud and fearless golden is the grain
That's the grain where we stand tall
In the face of doubt we won't fall
Every step that both can pain
Living life against the grain
As the night gives way to dawn
In the strength we've drawn
With our hearts we'll stake our claim
Living proud against the grain
