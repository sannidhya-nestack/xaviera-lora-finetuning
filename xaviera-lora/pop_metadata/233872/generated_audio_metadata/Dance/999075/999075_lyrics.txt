You think you know the purpose of our stages
Say I'm only entertainment, nothing more
Wanna put me where you think my place is
Order me on how to use the platform, oh
White baller tryna make me run, make me run, oh
Are you scared? My voice is a bigger threat than your gun
This crowd gets louder when you say
Sit down, count down, shut up, obey
Burn books, burn the authors too
You wanna eradicate every thought against you
Watch now, watch how we go to work
Watch out, we'll strike you where it hurts
Run you over'cause you're standing still
And maybe you won't feel it but history will
What you don't see coming's gonna hit you hardest
Don't underestimate a starving artist
Don't underestimate her
Don't underestimate her
Don't underestimate a starving artist
Drop a dollar on a dream of safety
Demand a refund if I contradict your views
Shoot your mouth saying I'm nobody
Just cause you didn't know my name well now you do
Too late to et it now that you gave a damn (uh-uh)
Oh, I'll make sure they remember who you are and where you stand
This crowd gets loud when you say
Sit down, count down, shut up, obey
Burn books, burn the authors too
You wanna eradicate every thought against you
Watch now, watch how we go to work
Watch out, we'll strike you where it hurts
It's running you over'cause you're standing still
And maybe you won't feel it but history will (what?)
You don't see coming's gonna hit you hardest
Don't underestimate a starving artist
Don't underestimate it
Don't underestimate it
Don't underestimate a starving artist
Don't underestimate it
Don't underestimate it
Don't underestimate it
Stop it, stop it
This crowd gets loud when you say
Sit down, count down, shut up, obey
Burn books, burn the authors too
You wanna eradicate every thought I instill
Watch now, watch how we go to work
Watch out
We'll strike you where it hurts
Run you over'cause you're standing still
And maybe you won't feel it but history will
What you don't see comes gonna hit you hardest
Don't underestimate a starving artist
Don't underestimate him
Don't underestimate him
No, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, oh
