Everybody's looking sharp tonight
City cars and bright lights in my set
Dance floors call me when lights they fight
Oh oh, I'm feeling it right
Laughter echoes, drinks in hand
Friends around, it's a one night band
Let's break our own bread
Up in the air, deep breathe
Hope beats like a perfect beat
Let it glow, let the disco light
Shake low, let's make our own bread
Shake low, in the air we breathe
Heartbeat sinking, perfect beat
Shake low, on the disco lights
Hold on tight, through the night
Step by step just you and me
Rhythm flows like the open sea
Shake your head, soul melody
Feel the rush, set your spirit free
Form is flash like a Polaroid
Joy so pure never get annoying
In this space we can't avoid
All the world's noise she could deploy
The fool and the happy breed
Hope beats like a perfect weed
I grew up on the disco life
She glowed, let's make her a bride
She glowed in the alley
Bringing heartbeats in here perfectly
She glowed on the disco night
So I tied to the night
Moments flash like a Polaroid
Joy so pure never get annoyed
In this space we can avoid
All the world's noise, she could deploy
Shake off in the air we breathe
Heartbeat sinking perfectly
Shake off on a disco night
So tired tonight
