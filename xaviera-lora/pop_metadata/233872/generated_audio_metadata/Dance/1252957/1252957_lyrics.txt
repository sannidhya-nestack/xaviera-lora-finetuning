Stars ignite within my core
A hunting force I can't ignore
Rhythms pulse into my veins
Unleashing chaos, breaking chains
Every beat a call to rise
Underneath the vast blue skies
Fueling flames of fierce reply
Fire in the belly, burning high
Fire in the belly, can't contain
Wild and free, a boundless flame
In the storm I find my name
Fire in the belly, endless game
Voices echo in the void
Silent whispers now deployed
Crashing waves and thunders roar
Guiding me to something more
Every beat a call to rise
Underneath the vast blue skies
Fueling flames of fierce reply
Fire in the belly, burning high
Fire in the belly, can't contain
Wild and free, a boundless flame
In the storm I find my name
Fire in the belly, endless game
In the shadows I ignite
Turning darkness into light
In the chaos on my way
Fire in the belly here to stay
Here to stay
Fire in the belly can't contain
Wild and free, a boundless flame
In the storm I find my name
Fire in the belly, endless game
Echoes fade but embers glow
In this place I come to know
Fire in my belly, let it show
We'll fit this fire, I will, I will grow
