This ain't the first time, this ain't the last time
This is now and this is forever
Give me your love now, show me you need me
Give me something, give me forever
I know you want it, I know you feel it
Let's just start and burn it together
And I'll burn the world for you
And I'll search the ocean blue
Give me something
Give me your love now
Give me forever
I know you want it
I need your love now
I wanna be stronger
Don't leave me here now
Give me forever
Think you're making me in love, think you're making me in love, think you're making me in love, think you're making me in love, think you're making me in love, think you're making me in love, think you're making -<|16.56|>
Just give me, give me your love now
Taking me home now
Making me love you for now and forever
Give me your love now
Taking me home now
I'll be everything that you want now
Give me forever
