These nights on my own I put the city to sleep
I put the city to sleep, oh
All the pictures in my phone I could never delete
No I could never delete
We need time, oh
To feel alive, oh
We'll be fine, oh
In our own little paradise
I find peace when I'm looking at the stars and low
The stars and low, oh
Every constellation I'm looking above
I'm looking above and I still see you
I see you in the middle of a dead dream
I see truth anywhere you take me
I see you, am I really dreaming? Yeah
We need time, oh-oh, to feel alive, oh-oh, we'll be fine, oh-oh, in our own little paradise
We need time, oh, to feel alive, oh, we'll be fine, oh, in our own
