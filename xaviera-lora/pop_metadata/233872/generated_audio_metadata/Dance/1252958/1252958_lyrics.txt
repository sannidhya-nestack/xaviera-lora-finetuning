I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm, I'm a, I'm a, I, I'm a, I'm a, I go up
Through the atoms and the atoms go
Break everything from within now
Misty, we let it flow
The ocean's set to disarray
Plot and shift and ricochet
Feel the pulse, don't hesitate
Stomp or pop, it's like the vay
Stop, pull, pop, and feel the vibe
In this chaos we arrive
Twisting sounds, we come alive
Stop, pull, pop, we won't subside
Echoes of a fragile tune
In the silence we commune
Harmony in broken lines
In this groove, the summer lines
Motion set to disarray
Pattern shift to disarray
Pattern shift to ricochet
Pattern shift to ricochet
Feel the pulse, don't hesitate
Feel the pulse, don't hesitate
Stumble, pop, let's activate
Stop, boom, pop, and feel the vibe
In this chaos we arrive
Twisting sounds, we come alive
Stop, boom, pop, we won't subside
Shattered beats and twisted chords
Find the rhythm, break the boards
In the flux, we find our spot
Stop, pull, pop, give all you've got
Stop, pull, pop and feel the vibe
In this chaos we arrive
Twisting sounds, we call our life
Stop, pull, pop, we won't subside
Stop, pull, pop, the final call
In the echoes we stand tall
Through the noise, we hear the call
Stop, pull, pop, we break the wall
