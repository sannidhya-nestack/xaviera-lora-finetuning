Walking down the street today
Saw you and I lost my way
Heart racing can't catch my breath
In a spin you got me stressed
Hands shining in the sunlight
Eyes sparkling oh so bright
You smiling I'm paralyzed
Every move is hypnotized
So where's the ache I've been swoonin'
Like a movie you keep me tuned in
Can't resist your perfect charm
I just wanna be in your arms
Every time you look my way
Words vanish nothing to say
You're a dream in real life for me love I want to warm
Step closer my pulse quicken
It gave my heart a fit again
You were laughing the world was perfect
In your love I wanna live
Smooth like the egg I'm spoonin'
Like the movie you keep me toomin'
Can't resist the perfect charm
I just want deep in your heart
Every time you look my way
Words vanish, nothing to say
You're a dream in real life for me, love, I want to walk
Step closer my pulse quickens
In your gaze my heart thickens
You laugh and the world's perfect
In your love I wanna live
Swoon with me yeah you got me swoonin'
Like a movie you keep me tuned in
Can't resist your perfect charm
I just wanna be in your arms
Yeah
