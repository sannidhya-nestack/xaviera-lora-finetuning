Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Seems like every day just fades away
Everybody's got something to say
You and I we're not the same
But that don't mean we can't be unchained
Chaos and disorder
Won't you wash me in the water
Save us from ourselves now
Save us from ourselves now
The truth and the deception
The answer and the question
Save us from ourselves now
Save us from ourselves now
I need to see it, I need to feel it, I must believe it
Seems like one by one we fall from grace
On and on repeat the same mistakes
I can't seem to think it straight
But that don't mean we can't change our fate
Chaos and disorder
Won't you wash me in the water
Save us from ourselves now
Save us from ourselves now
The truth in the deception
The answer in the question
Save us from ourselves now
Save us from ourselves now
I need to see it, I need to feel it, I must believe it
And I feel like dancing in the rain (in the rain)
And I feel like dancing in the rain (in the rain)
I need to see it, I need to feel it, I must believe it
And I feel like dancing in the rain (in the rain)
Save us from ourselves now
Save us from ourselves now
I need to see it, I need to feel it, I must believe it
Save us from ourselves now
