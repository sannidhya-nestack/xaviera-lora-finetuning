You got me to a place of sunshine
Where the skies are always blue
Every step with you feels so divine
In a world that's made for two
Oh, your light, it guides me through the night
In your eyes I see the perfect sight
With you, I'm never lost
You're my guiding light
You're my personal star, that's for sure
Lighting up my world, giving so much more
In your embrace, I'll find my peace
If you my love, my heart's at ease
Walking hand in hand through golden sands
Every moment feels so right
In this dance we take our chances
Underneath the starry night
Oh your light guides me through the night
In your eyes I see the perfect sight
With you I'm never lost in my guiding light
You're my personal star, that's for sure
Lighting up my world, giving so much more
In your embrace, I find my peace
If you're my love, my heart's at ease
