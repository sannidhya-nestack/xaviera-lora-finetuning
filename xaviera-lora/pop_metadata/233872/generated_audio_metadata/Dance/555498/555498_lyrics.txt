Hung over and blessed
Like I'm under arrest
you crashed into my heart
The devil in flesh
You're a dopamine bash
Reveals my worst and my best
Damn what a mess
my mind is splitting
Oh my body wants to go
I wanna go
I wanna go
Don't know how I can resist your body and your kiss
It's gonna blow, it's gonna blow-ow-ow
Oh, my heart is into double trouble
You could be a con or be an icon
I don't know if you got brains or muscles
If you're the one or more like Saint John
Don't wanna jump the gun, it's falling on the fun
But it's dragging me down, I'm spinning round and round
Oh, I'm falling for your body double
Don't care for the gun or for the icon, I used to do fine
No troubles on my mind, nothing to fly, just the true and the tried
Now I'm trying to hide, I've launched into your cloud night
Like a Soviet spy, I'm mystified
Our bodies talking dialect, causing an effect
We're gonna blow, we're gonna blow-oh-oh
But I'm ready to reload to get my Romeo
My Romeo, my Romeo-oh-oh
Oh, my heart is in to double trouble
You could be a con or be an icon
I don't know if you got brains or muscles
Iggy or Don Juan, I'm more like Saint John
Don't wanna jump the gun, it's falling all the fun
But it's dragging me down and spinning round and round
Oh, I'm falling for your body double
Don't care for the con or for the icon
(Woo)
Oh, my heart runs in a raging riot
You're driving me wild, I'm feeling so blind
Oh, my heart runs in a raging riot
You're driving me wild, I'm feeling so blind
And I don't know if I can even fight it
You're driving me wild, I'm feeling so blind
Woo!
Woo!
Oh, my heart is into double trouble
You could be a con or be an icon
I don't know if you got brains or muscles
you're the one, or more like sunshine
Don't wanna jump the gun, it's falling all the fun
But it's dragging me down, it's spinning round and round
Oh, I'm falling for your party double
Don't care for the pain, or for the heat
