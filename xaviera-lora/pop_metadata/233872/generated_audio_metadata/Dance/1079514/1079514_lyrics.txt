I remember from the start when you smoothed the wrinkles from my heart
With a single touch, that's a plus
There isn't much more I can say but to give your love a solid A you've passed
Every test I could ever dream of
I'm enchanted, romantic, attracted when you're in my brain
But that's not a complaint, oh no
You read me completely, so deeply
Like no one has before
Down to my core, locking me, oh oh oh oh
I can see that you are my most wanted one
My whole world exists for you
Since you came into my view
Lucky me, oh oh oh oh
I can see that you are my most wanted
You and me, oh, oh, oh, oh
Think it's this
You don't seem like the magic type
But I feel like I've been hypnotized
Just a look from you to end my drought
I never was the gambling kind
But my bed or you has changed my mind
And I want a life supply of you now
Consider me triggered, just picture
I'm alone with you is an experience
I can't miss
It hit me
So quickly
Quite simply
I never noticed
Love could be like this
Locking me
Oh oh oh oh
I can see
That you are
My most wanted
You and me
Oh oh oh oh
Thick as thieves
Oh yes
That's the truth
Am I on you?
So long like a spy
I know you're minus one
And no one else comes close
You are minus one
