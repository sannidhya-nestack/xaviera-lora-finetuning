Amidst the city's symphony
We found a song, a melody that pulls us in
Where we belong, our hearts in sync, a perfect rhyme
A love so pure it's written in time
With every step we take, the rhythm grows
A love so pure it's written in time
With every step we take, the rhythm grows
The song between us, it ebbs and flows
We're dancing through life hand in hand
Our love's a force that can't be bent
Heartbeat harmony
Echoes through the night
Our souls entwined, shining light
Together we'll soar, reaching for the sky
In this dance of love, we'll never say goodbye
Through the highs and lows we'll persevere
Our love's a symphony that's always near
No matter the distance we'll find our way
This heartbeat harmony is here to stay
The love so true it will forever belong
Our voices united, a perfect blend
This heartbeat in harmony will never end
The masses united, a perfect blend
This heartbeat in harmony will never end
In this dance of love, we'll never say goodbye
The heartbeat harmony echoes through the night
Souls entwined in a shining light
Together we'll soar to the other sky
In this dance of love we'll never say goodbye
And in that we'll never say goodbye
Hand in hand we'll face the unknown, this heartbeat harmony
Forever sewn, the symphony of life, a final place, a love, a melody
A lasting grace
