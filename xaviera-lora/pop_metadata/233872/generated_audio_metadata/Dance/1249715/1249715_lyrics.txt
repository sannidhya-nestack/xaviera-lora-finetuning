Mystery
Mystery, mystery night
Another tale in time
Mystery night
Under the stars with neon eyes
We dance on cosmic ties
And to the beat of hearts so pure
In moments that endure, oh yeah
Oh feel the pulse, it lights our way
With every step we sway and sway
Mystery night, another dream to chase
Mystery night
Invisible it's you and I
No we can never hide
For now it's clear just take my hand
Forever we will stand like magic bands
You will always find the rhythm
Guiding through this space
Feel the pulse it lights our way
Mystery night, mystery night, mystery night
Electric waves, they'd pull us close
A journey we compose
No gravity, just you and me
In sync, eternally
Oh yeah, oh let the fire ignite our souls
We'll break the limits, lose control
