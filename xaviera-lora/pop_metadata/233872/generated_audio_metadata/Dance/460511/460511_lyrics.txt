Yo man, these ladies are killing me on the dance floor
Yo bartender, just give me what I need man
Give me some of that eighteen hundred, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, let's get rowdy
She's got that magic carpet, I see her fly by
I wanna hop aboard and ride it with her through the sky
I like her altitude, she's off the latitude
There isn't anybody with a body bad as you
And when
I arrive, I see the shorty shorty
I see it in her eyes, she's lookin' naughty naughty
She kinda flown it, flown it, I kinda want it, want it
I'ma launch upon it, I'm throwin' down my gauntlet (gauntlet, gauntlet)
And you know we're jumping, jumping on the floor
Bass pumping, body sweating, grinding, bumping
I'm about to fall in love
It's getting wild and crazy face to face
I feel you racing heart pumping, pounding, pacing
I'm about to fall in love
Hey Mr. DJ play my song up in this club
I see this girl here
And I think that I'm in love, I think that I'm in love, I think that I'm in love
I can't leave this club cause I think that I'm in love
We do it a twist twist, we do it a cha cha cha
You make me trip trip, and I'm like ja ja ja
Unstrap that bra bra bra, et the drama ma
Yo, them problemas,'cause I ain't pobre ma
I like this position, body collision
I'm navigating'round your curves like this is pole position
You got me hoping, wishing, I got this whole vision
It's you, it's me, it's clear as day, let's get them clothes ripping
One, two, three, what?
And you know we're jumping, jumping on the floor
Bass pumping, body sweating, grinding, bumping
I'm about to fall in love, it's getting real
I'm wild and crazy face to face I feel you racing heart pumping panic pacing
I'm about to fall in love hey Mr. DJ play my song up in this club
I see this girl here and I think that I'm in love
I think that I'm in love I think that I'm in love
I can't leave this club cause I think that I'm in love
I'm in a whirlwind, I'm in a whirlpool spinning round twirling
My ship is going under, my flare is in the sky
You are my only hope, baby throw me a line
I'm feeling fortunate, dance floor she's torching it
Flame throwing scorching it, like she's a sorceress
She is so eous, I love her portrait
I'm knocking hard now let me in your fortress
And you know we're jumping jumping
Jumpin' on the floor, bass pumpin' body, sweatin', grindin', bumpin'
I'm about to fall in love, it's gettin' wild and crazy, face to face, I feel you racin' heart, pumpin', panic pacin'
I'm about to fall in love, hey, Mr. DJ, play my song up in this club
I see this girl here and I think that I'm in love (love)
I think that I'm in love (love), I think that I'm in love
I can't leave this club'cause I think that I'm in love (love)
And now we're jumpin', jumpin' on the floor
Bass pumping, body sweating, grinding, bumping
I'm about to fall in love
It's getting wild and crazy face to face
I feel you racing heart pumping, pounding, pacing
I'm about to fall in love
Hey Mr. DJ play my song up in this club
I see this girl here and I think that I'm in love
I think that I'm in love
I think that I'm in love
I can't leave this club cause I think that I'm in love
