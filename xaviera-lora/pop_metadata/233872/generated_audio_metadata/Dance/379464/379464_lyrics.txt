Mother with the sun and the dove with the colour
Just another sunny day
Young coupling, falling, enjoying the weather
And I'm here and here to stay, oh-hmm
Even my old man is kinda happy as he watches his car, frankly, oh-hmm
All colors shining bright'cause every color gets its space, yeah
Everyone's okay, everything feels great
Even trees they start to sing
Ooh, can't bring nothing on my mind
All troubles are left behind
These feelings are enough for me
Let the wind take care of me
It's what I call quality
Can't trade this for money, see
Some might say it's all in my head
I say it's a super sunny day
It's a super sunny day
Closure, no bad times, my opinion
Isn't that a great idea, yeah
Wrong turn, change lanes, don't let it get to you
Come on in, I got some space
Yeah yeah yeah
My day is a day without frustration
You're invited to change
I offer satisfaction
Just enjoy expenses paid
So inspiring, when it all feels great
Everybody starts to sing
Ooh, I can't frame the thing on my mind
All troubles you left behind
These feelings are enough you see
Let the wind take care of me
It's what I call quality
Can't trade this for money, see
Some might say it's all in your head
And it's your super sunny day
Sunshine or cloud green, it doesn't matter
Just make sure you are easy, yeah
Blue, white, black, green, doesn't matter what color
Be famous anyway
So inspiring,'cause we do feel great
Bet you really want to sing, oh
Can't free nothing on my mind
All troubles are left behind
These feelings are enough for me
Let the wind take care of me
It's what I call quality
Can't trade this for money, see
Some might say it's all in my head
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't free nothing on my mind
All trouble you left behind
These feelings are enough for me
Let the wind take care of me
It's one of a quality
Can't trade this for money, see
Somewhat say it's all in my head
Welcome to my super sunny day, yeah
To my super sunny day, yeah
Super sunny day
