Dancing in the cosmos where the star dust glows
In the space between us where the magic flows
Astral flares are guiding lighting up the night
In this endless journey everything feels right
Astral flares lighting up the sky
In the darkness we so high
Through the galaxy we share
Lost in love and astral flips
Floating through the silence where the calm leaves play
Every constellation showing us the way
Astroflares are blazing trails of silver light
In this cosmic dance we ignite the night
Astroflares lighting up the sky
In the darkness we soar high
Through the galaxy we share a lost in love
In astroflares
Flowing through the silence where the comet's plane
Every constellation showing us the way
Astral plans are blazing trails of silver light
In this cosmic dance we ignite the night
Astral flares lining up the sky
In the darkness we soar high
Through the galaxy we share
Lost in love and astral flares
Stars are all around us in this vast expanse
Every moment fleeting in this cosmic trance
Astral flares are burning with a fiery glow
Guiding us together everywhere we go
Astral flares lighting up the sky
In the darkness we soar high
Through the galaxy we share
Lost in love in astral flares
Astral flares in the night
Guiding us with their light
In this dance beyond compare
Lost forever in astral flares
