The clouds are lit like tangerine
Tonight we're looking pretty and mean
Lock and loaded ready to roll
Sing with us cause we're out of control
There's a rave down highway 9
We're driving Kelly style
Rush rush
Woah oh oh oh
Cause it's the light that cries
For being mystified by us
Woah oh oh oh
We'll dance into the dark, kill all the lights and stars
We're beautiful, bizarre (yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're up like superstars, getting down so hard
We're beautiful, bizarre (yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're beautiful, bizarre (oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
We're beautiful, bizarre (oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
We'll crank the boombox in our bar (bar, bar, bar)
the sun strikes, we'll raise up the bar (the bar)
Lazy liquor, frazzled brain (brain, brain, brain)
We're sick and sexy, acting insane (acting insane)
Feels like our last night on earth
We're stoked and we're firm, nothing to hide, woah-oh-oh-oh
Gonna give it all we've got and blow your mind tonight, woah-oh-oh-oh
We'll dance into the dark, kill all the lights and stars
We're beautiful, bizarre (yeah, yeah, yeah)
We'll rock like superstars, we're getting down so hard
We're beautiful, bizarre (yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're beautiful, bizarre (oh, oh, oh)
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
We're beautiful bizarre
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, beautiful bizarre
Oh, beautiful bizarre
We'll finish what we started
we know who we are
A beautiful bizarre
death or day we'll smile
we know who we are
A beautiful bizarre
All days into the dark
You'll love the lights and stars
A beautiful bizarre
We'll rock like superstars, getting down so hard, we're beautiful bizarre
We're beautiful bizarre, you know who you are, you're beautiful bizarre
We're beautiful bizarre, you know who you are you're beautiful bizarre
We're beautiful bitches, you know who you are, you're beautiful bitches
