I just got paid, so I won't rush,'cause tonight's untamed
Let's hang on'til the dawn breaks, just cans and shades
You don't need much,'til the sunlight fades
Lookin' sweet just like a cupcake
And I, I, I, I'm not soft-tailed
I'm getting hung up on your honey
And I, I, I, cry and ramble, yell
I want you to be my lover
I wanna own your heart to get you in my zone
Rock you till your heart gets sewn
Wanna own your show you gonna go for broke
Gonna give you poppy love
Own your heart to get you in my zone
Rock you till your heart gets sewn
Wanna own your show you gonna go for broke
Gonna give you poppy love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Thank you'til your heart gets out
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Gonna give you popping love
Like the sunshine stain, you're blazing
Looking sick insane
Don't know how we got to your place
Our hearts just race, and we're yearning
This pain on top ain't safe
I can't promise you I'll behave
And I, I, I
Don't wanna break this spell
Lost control of my body
And I don't wanna kiss and tell
Don't wanna share you with no other
I wanna own your heart to get you in my zone
Rock you till your heart gets sewn
Wanna own your show you're gonna go for broke
Gonna give you puppy love
Own your heart to get you in my zone
Rock you till your heart gets stoned
When I own your show you gonna go for broke
Gonna give you puppy love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Rock you till your heart gets stoned
Oh oh oh oh oh
Gonna give you puppy love
Own your horse she'll get you in my zone
Falling like a domino
On your show you're gonna go for broke
Like a love game overload
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
Rockin'til your heart gets dumb
On your show, you're gonna go for broke
Gonna give you puppy love
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh yeah
Rockin'til your heart gets dumb
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh
Gonna give you puppy love
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh
Rock it'til your heart gets stoned (Rock it'til your heart gets stoned, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Gonna give you puppy love
