In the heart of the meadow where the wildflowers grow
There's a secret whispered by the river's gentle flow
A place where worries fade like shadows in the breeze
Where the soul finds solace under the rustling trees
With every step I take I leave the past behind
Embracing every moment with a peaceful mind
The world may spin around
But here I stand still
In this sanctuary
I find my will
Ray of bliss wash over me
In this tranquil harmony
Let the world around us see
The beauty in simplicity
In the golden sunrise
As the dew begins to dry
There's a silent promise
Written in the sky
A melody of nature
In every chirping hum
A song of pure contentment
Where I feel I've come
With every step I take
I leave in peace so deep
Unbreaking the spirit
From its quiet sleep
The world may rush and roar
But here I found my calm
In this perfect moment
I hold the balm
Ray of bliss wash over me
In this tranquil harmony
Let the world around us see
The beauty in simplicity
Lonely for grand illusions
Just the earth beneath my feet
In the hush of morning
Where my heart and nature meet
The whisper of the leaves
The murmur of the stream
In this peaceful haven
I find my dream
Ray of bliss wash over me
In this tranquil harmony
Let the world around us see
The beauty in simplicity
So here I stand and wonder
Where the wild flowers grow
In this perfect stillness
My true self I know
Ray of bliss you guide me
In your gentlest way
In this endless moments
Forever I will stay
