(Certified cushion)
Bare myself to the world
Hit the roof, yeah
Drunk on the memories, volumes of us
Feel your everything, trembling touch
Give it up, give it up
Rising to the beat now pull me close
Feel the heat when you want it most
Rising to the beat now pull me in
Disappear anywhere we wanna go
Sinking into you and it feels so right
Automatic craving right through the night
Rising to the beat now pull me close
Feel the heat when you want it most
I'm rising to the beat now (I'm rising to the beat now, beat now, beat now, oh)
I'm rising to the beat now (I'm rising to the beat now, beat now, beat now)
I'm rising to the beat now
Pull me closer to the heat when you want it most
Reveal yourself to my world
Hit the roof, yeah
Turn up in all the chaos, it's an outbreak of lust
Explicitly suggestive and we're feeling the rush
Give it up, give it up (give it up)
I'm rising to the beat now, pull me close
Feel the heat when you want it most (ooh)
Rising to the beat now, pull me in
Disappear anywhere we wanna go (ooh)
Sinking into you and it feels so right
Automatic craving right through the night
Rising to the beat now
Pull me close to the heat when you want it most
Rising to the beat now, beat now, beat now, oh
Rising to the beat now, beat now, beat now, oh
Blossom to the beat now, pull me close, feel the heat when you want it most (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (blossom to the beat now) (blossom to the beat now) (blossom to the beat now)
Rising to the beat now, move me close, feel the heat when you want it most
