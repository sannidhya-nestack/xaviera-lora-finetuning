Won't lie, caught me by surprise
Neon butterflies, neon butterflies
Feeling dizzy on this carousel
I'm too busy even for myself (oh yeah)
Yeah it gets lonely in the prison cell
Oh time and time again
Yes time is not my friend
Wow, you changed my mind so quickly
Total laser focus now
Walleye, caught me by surprise
Neon butterflies, and you know I'm not the type
Late nights, unlock what's in my eyes
Come crack my code tonight
You make me feel that high, high, high, high
I'm down if you don't see me up in an hour
Got me focused on chemistry, baby, what we could be (what we could be)
Won't lie, you caught me by surprise
Neon butterflies, neon butterflies
Mile a minute you run through my head
If my heart is in it, end up in my bed
The stars are dancing in this chemistry
Oh time and time again
Can time just be my friend?
Wow, you changed my mind so quickly
Total ease of focus now
Won't lie, caught me by surprise
Neon butterflies, and you know I'm not the type
Late nights, unlock what's in my eyes
Come crack my code tonight
You make me feel that hot, hot, hot, hot
I'm done if you don't see me up in an hour
Got me focused on chemistry, baby, what we could be (what we could be)
Won't lie, you caught me by surprise
Neon butterflies, neon butterflies
I've been close but now the door's open
Low key cheated, walls are faded
Just one look, I'm hooked on this emotion
And I don't want a style, it's so beautiful
Spots ignite
Don't lie, you caught me by surprise
Neon butterflies
And you know I'm not the type
Late nights, I love what's in my eyes
Come crack my code tonight
You make me feel that high, high, high, high
I'm down if you dance with me up in the now (If you feel alive just this night)
Got me focused on chemistry, baby, what we could be (Just tonight)
Won't lie, you caught me by surprise
Neon butterflies, neon butterflies
