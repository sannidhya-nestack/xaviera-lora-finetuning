You sit there and you wonder why
You're not going out tonight
When you're young and free you should be having fun
The inner radar seeks you out
Neon lights begin to shine
Three dimensional trends now it's there
Take the chance keep on going
Keep on going, yeah
Keep on going, yeah
Hold on baby, hold on baby
Keep on going, yeah
Keep on going, yeah
Keep on holding
Catch a glare of the distant lights
Kick your heels and close your eyes
Living hard behind the wheel
You should feel more real, more real
Keep on going, yeah
Keep on going, yeah
Hold on baby, hold on baby
Keep on going, yeah
Keep on going, yeah
Keep on holding
Hold on baby, hold on baby, hold on baby
Keep on holding
You gotta keep on
You gotta keep on baby
