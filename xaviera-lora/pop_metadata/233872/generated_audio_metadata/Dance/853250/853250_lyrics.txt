All of these letters that I've written
Have always needed a home
All of these pages bear the traces
Of other girls that don't belong
So I'm wasted in the basement
Writing songs of lovers gone
The corner of the room is overflowing
From the pages that I've thrown
Tell me what it's like
So I can see and write about
The world through your eyes
Through your eyes, through your eyes
Tell me what it's like
So I can see right about
I wanna be with you when my story ends
I don't know how many stories I have left
But I know now, yes I know now
I want you to be the last to show me
Show me what it's like
So I can see right about the world
Through your eyes
Through your eyes
Tell me what it's like
So I can see right about
Through your eyes
