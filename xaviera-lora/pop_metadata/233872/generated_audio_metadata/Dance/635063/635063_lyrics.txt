How many stitches does it take
I lie on my bed wrapped and padded in white
See the monitor pulse in the glow of the light
Now the room is disintegrating and I
Roll under an exit sign
Scalpel please, ECG, anesthetize
Is what I hear as I close my eyes
Chemical undertow pulling me down
I'm ready for the doctor now
Breathe, breathe, count to three, critical injury
How many stitches does it take to repair a heart?
Heartbreak, gravy, emergency, serious surgery
How many stitches does it take to repair a heartbreak?
La da da da
Get me a doctor
La da da da
Give me a drug
La da da da
Help me recover
Save me from this poisonous love
La da da
La-da-da
La-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
I am under a spotlight
A shape on a stage
A grim operation
A vital exchange
A little defective
A little diseased
Incomplete anatomy
Scalpel please, ECG, anesthetize
Is what I hear as I close my eyes
Chemical undertow pulling me down
I'm ready for the doctor now
How many stitches does it take to repair a heartbreak?
Grave emergency, serious surgery
How many stitches does it take to repair a heartbreak?
La da da da, get me a doctor
La da da da, give me a drug
La da da da
Help me recover
Save me from this poisonous love (the doctor has arrived)
Yo, yo
Trust me baby I'm a doctor (oh)
Depibulator I'ma shock ya (oh)
Drugs and a needle pull the bottom, flip the top up and he will, he will, he will rock ya
How many kisses does it take for me to make your earth quake?
Got your heart broken now you up in emergency (uh huh)
Need shame mode to perform the surgery (oh)
I'ma put my glove on and keep my hands steady (da-da-da-da)
Countdown from a hundred and a moment we'll be ready (da-da-da-da)
Got you all stitched up by the time you woke up
Is you still thinking'bout your other man? No sir!
I'ma put that thing on you, have your ass doped up, watch
Watch me pee, ECG, anesthetize
Is what I hear as I close my eyes
Chemical, I'm dying
Pulling me down, ready for the doctor now
Breathe, breathe, count to three, critical injury
How many stitches does it take to repair a heartbreak craving?
Emergency, serious surgery
How many stitches does it take to repair a heartbreak?
La da da da
Get me a doctor (get me a doctor)
La da da da
Give me a drug (give me a drug)
La da da da
Help me recover (help me recover)
Save me from this
Save me from this
La da da da
Breathe breathe
La da da da
Breathe breathe
La da da da
Breathe breathe
Save me from this poisonous love
