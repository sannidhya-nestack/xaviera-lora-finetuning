You love your symphony, playin' just for me, a beat that sets me free, we're dancin' endlessly
Every note, every rhyme, feels like magic all the time
In this song of yours and mine, we're forever in the prime
You're the melody, my heart's harmony, like a pop song stuck on repeat
We're a perfect tune in the summer heat, oh-oh
You're my favorite heat
My love's like rock and roll
Wild and out of control
With a touch of soul
We're making stories bold
Every verse, every line
Feels like we're in perfect time
In this rhythm, so divine
We're a love song by design
You're my melody
My heart's harmony
Like a pop song stuck on repeat
We're a perfect tune in the summer heat, oh-oh
You're my favorite beat
From the jazz of your kiss to the blues we won't miss
Every genre, every sound
In your love I'm spellbound
You're my melody, my heart's harmony
Like the pop song stuck on repeat
We're a perfect two in the summer heat, oh-oh
You're my favorite beat, oh-oh
Run off like rock and roll
Wild and out of control
With the touch of soul
We're making souls bold
Every verse, every line
Feels like we're in perfect time
In this rhythm so divine
We're all lost on by design
You're my melody
My heart's harmony
Like a pop song stuck on repeat
We're the perfect dude in the summer heat, oh oh
You're my baby thief from the jazz of your kiss
To the blues we won't miss every charm and every sound
In your love I'm spellbound
You're my melody, my heart's harmony
Like the pop songs, the comedy
With the way that you dance in the heat
Oh, oh, you're my lady
I'm just a timeless hit
Every moment, every bit
You're my number one hit
Together we're forever young
