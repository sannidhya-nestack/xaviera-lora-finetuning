Now I'm not feeling alive
Can't you see that I'm alive?
High time to get it
We're still standing
I'm not feeling alive
But can't you see?
A moment slipping
And we're still in love
Yesterday is gone, keeps on fading
Feel the weight
Of all that we're evading
Step into this don't let us miss out today
Let it free you, lift you high
Lost in time and now our chance is flying
I can take you where we need to go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Find time and stick me in
If we're still standing in the same spot in the daylight
Can't you see? (Can't you see?)
Don't delay
I want to love the bits that line and stop my shit
And it was the best, I wanna get on the way
This party got away
Come on, feel the beat, hearts race
Stars are aligning
In this fleeting moment, are we standing?
The time, the night
