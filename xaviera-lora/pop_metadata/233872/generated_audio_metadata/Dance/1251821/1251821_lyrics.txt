Didn't leave our smoke in the air
Vodka on ice, I'm already there
Your eyes meet mine across the room
We both know what we're gonna do
No strings attached, that's how we roll
One night of bliss to feed my soul
Don't need your love, just need your touch
Is that too much?
High on the rush, low on emotion
Diving deep in this wild commotion
Bodies entwined, sweat on my skin
This is my drug, my favorite sin
Don't wanna stop, don't wanna think
Just wanna feel, just wanna sink
Into this moment, into this high
baby, I'm not built for love, I'm -<|20.40|>
I'm -I'm -I'm -I'm -I'm -I'm -I'm -I'm -I'm -I'm -I'm -I'm -I'm -I'm -I'm -I'm -I'm -I'm -<|29.24|>
Morning light creeps through the blinds
Last night's memories cloud my mind
Lipstick stains and tangled sheets
The aftermath of midnight beats
No regrets, that's what I say
But why does my heart feel this way?
One taste and you know I'm addicted
And it was never predicted
High on the rush, low on emotion
Diving deep in this wild commotion
Bodies entwined, sweat on my skin
This is my drug, my favorite sin
Don't wanna stop, don't wanna think
Just wanna feel, just wanna sink
Into this moment, into this high
baby, I'm not built for love, I ain't
In the daylight we're strangers, at night we're a danger
This cycle's never ending, my heart's still bending but I can't quit you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
High on the rush, low on emotion
Diving deep in this wild commotion
Bodies entwined, sweat on my skin
This is my drug, my favorite sin
Don't wanna stop, don't wanna think
Just wanna feel, just wanna sink
Into this moment, into this high
baby, I'm not built for love, oh
