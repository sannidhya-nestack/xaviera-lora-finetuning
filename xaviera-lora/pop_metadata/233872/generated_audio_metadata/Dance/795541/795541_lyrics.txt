Hey you, done what you're doing tonight
Still waiting gaze until you drop
It's too late, she's got you fooled all this time
Your only saving grace is to get up
Stay high, let's get nasty and tight
Leave it up, we're getting down tonight
C'est la vie when hearts are open
To do run when soak up the sun
C'est la vie when hearts are broken
To do run when one steal our fun
To do run until we're done
I owe you not a thing (I owe you not a thing)
You owe me just the same (You owe me just the same)
I owe you not a thing (I owe you not a thing)
You owe me just the same
Dance like there's no tomorrow to run until we're done (I owe you not a thing)
Dance like there's no tomorrow to run until we're done (I owe you not a thing)
Dance
Like there's no tomorrow to run until we're done (you know you got a chance)
Like there's no tomorrow to run until we're done
Amaze me, might let you miss the fight (oh-oh)
No more maybe waiting for some love (oh-oh)
Play me,'cause it's just you and I (oh-oh)
No chasing ghosts that done you wrong
Stay high, turn this sugar to spice
Live it up, we're getting down tonight
Say lovey when hearts are open
To do run run soak up the sun
Say lovey when hearts are broken
To do run run won't steal our fun
To do run run till we're done
I owe you not a thing (I owe you not a thing)
You owe me just the same (You owe me just the same)
I owe you not a thing (I owe you not a thing)
You owe me just the same
Dance like there's no tomorrow to run until we're done (Run, oh, you're not a gym)
Dance like there's no tomorrow to run until we're done (Run, oh, you're not a gym)
Dance like there's no tomorrow to run until we've done (Run, oh, you're not a gym)
Dance like there's no tomorrow to run until we done
They love you when hearts are open
To do run run soak up the sun
They love you when hearts are broken
To do run run won't steal our fun
They love you when hearts are open
To do run run soak up the sun
To do run run till we're done
