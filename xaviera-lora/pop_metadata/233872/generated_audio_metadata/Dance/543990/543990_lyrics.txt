Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm on the interstate, in the Chevrolet, in the'55, goin'78, hey
On 285, just passed'78, hey
With a loaded 9, smokin' on some Mary J., hey
Bitch, I'm on the grind, I hustle every day
Pound for pound call me a heavyweight
Round for round nigga I don't hesitate
I'm doing real estate tryna get my business straight
Got us going down on my license plate
Cause it's going down so get out the way
Tryna separate the real from the fake
So I'ma demonstrate which I'll imitate
And that's flipping cakes cause nigga I'm good at it
I don't talk much I'm from the hood daddy
See these splurging they ain't worried bout the post
Cause I'm a mad shot they already know me
I'm coming round the loop
I'm in the Bentley coupe
In a 35 doing 22
Don't honk your horn
Don't flash your light
Cause me and Joe they passing blunts like we pass the mic
I'm after nice
The A's after me
Bitch I'm a boss I can increase your salary
Locked up in ATL
For getting blunted
Straight out of Fulton County
To Magic City Monday
Blowing money
Throwing money, it's snowing money
These bitches should lay down and make a snow angel
Let the bitch suck my dick, now her dope long paper
Short gangster, short vanquish
And I can speak everything except court language
Snitches die ugly, so I forbid thee
And tell her pigs come and get me
Catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me If you Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch
My windows tinted I'm a menace yeah I admit it but still I got to get it
Whip it till I'm out of business and flip it like acrobatics
Boy better mind your business than strapping them automatics
It's about paper stacking not about activating
Grams I'm cackling cause I'm glued with the mathematics
I got a kilo on me I'm going to see the homies
I'm knowing if I get caught that I'm going to see big homies
I'm going all out
Never hustle scary, I'm a thoroughbred
Not your ordinary, plus my hustle buried
Strictly bout my cash, if I really need it
Then I'ma wear a mask, couple hundred slaps
In the paper bag, and if we see the cops
We dipping on they ass
Famous, long paper, short gangster, short vanquish
And I can speak everything except court language
Snitches die ugly, so I forbid thee
And tell the pigs come and get me
Catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch me if you catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch Catch
I'm a menace, yeah I admit it, but still I got to get it
Sweep it'til I'm out of business, and slip it like acrobatics
Boy, better mind your business than strapping them automatics
It's about who paper stacking, not about who activating
Grams I'm calculating,'cause I'm blue with the mathematics
I got a kilo on me, I'm going to see the homies
I'm knowing if I get caught that I'm going to see big homie
I'm going all out, never hustle scary
I'm a thoroughbred, not your ordinary
Plus my hustle buried, strictly about my cash
If I really need it, then I'ma wear a mask
Couple hundred slaps, in the paper bag
And if we see the cops, we dipping on they ass
