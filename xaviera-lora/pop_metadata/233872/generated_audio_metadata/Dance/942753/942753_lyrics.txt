Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma
Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma
There is something that is haunting
And it's playing over in my mind
Always, always, it's a feeling
When I wake up that I need you by my side
Always, always, it's a feeling
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, oh no, no, no, no, oh no, no, no
Somehow everything was different
Like a new person had emerged from me
I could see myself in a perspective that I've never seen before
No inhibitions, no worries
For the first time I felt like I knew where I belonged and nothing could stop me from being there
Nothing and yet everything felt real
The world was underneath me, around me, above me
I could see everything and everything could see me
This feeling, this feeling, this feeling, this feeling, this feeling
I'm all alone, I'm all alone
I'm all alone, I'm all alone
I'm all alone, I'm all alone
I'm all alone, I'm all alone
Oh no no no, oh no no no
