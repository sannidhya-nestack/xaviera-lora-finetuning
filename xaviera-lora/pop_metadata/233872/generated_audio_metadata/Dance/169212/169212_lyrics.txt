Flashes from my mind
Floating swiftly through the night
Oh, mirror of life
Watching different faces
Magic eyes set me on fire
Games of desire
Close my eyes and dreams will come back
In waves of eternity
And maybe someday it's you and me
Silence of the moon is watching over us
I'm flying higher
The silence of the moon is watching over us
We're flying high, we're heading to
The silence of the moon
Silence of the moon
Secrets of the sky
In a trance of living lies
Oh, a mirror of light
Don't keep waiting, hesitating
I'll show you what I feel inside
Give me your pride
Close your eyes, I'm taking you now
On a trip to eternity
Believing somehow it's you and me
Silence at the moon, it's what you never was
I'm flying higher in the sky
Silence of the moon is watching over us
We're flying high, we're heading to
The silence of the moon
