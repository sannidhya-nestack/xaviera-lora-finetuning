I went to Africa, Mama Africa
I met a cute girl, beautiful like pearl
We fell in love, so deep in love
When I look into her eyes, I see paradise
You are my paradise, I can't deny, you make me high
You are my paradise, I can't deny, you make me high
Together we go to a city where there's no pain
Peppermint, take me away
The love is forever with you, I mean no shame
Peppermint
Twente, let's go
Peppermint, paradise
Twente, let's go
Peppermint
Paradise
There wouldn't be no goodbye
It's no surprise
I'm hypnotized
There wouldn't be no goodbye
I'm hypnotized
So
There
Together we go to a city where there's no pain
People need
Take me away
The love is forever with you
I mean no shame
Bipoli
I went to Africa
Mama Africa
I met a cute girl
Beautiful like pearl
We fell in love
So deep in love
When I look into her eyes
I see paradise
