Can you feel this energy?
It's like a dream, don't wanna wake
Oh, oh, yeah
Lights are flashing to my favorite beat
Come on baby move your feet
This vibe's electric won't face defeat
Don't let this magic fade away
you and I it's an adventure
Like a story yet untold
Feels like every moment's treasured
Don't wanna let you
How does it feel
How does it feel when we dance?
How does it feel in this trance?
Do you want it? Do you need it?
Can you feel it? Tell me how does it feel when we dance?
How does it feel when we dance?
How does it feel? Is this true?
Tell me how does it feel when we dance?
How does it feel when we dance?
How does it feel when we dance
