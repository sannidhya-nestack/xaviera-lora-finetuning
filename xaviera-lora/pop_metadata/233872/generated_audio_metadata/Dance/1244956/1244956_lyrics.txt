Red sunsets and all of the nights
Your silhouette in the fading lights
We're lost in canyons vast and wide
Where whispered secrets go to hide
Vinyl spinning that old sweet sound
Drifting through this ghostly town
Lips like sugar, eyes so deep
Promises that we can't keep
Whispers in the cannon calling me home
To a love so wild where I once roam
It touched, lingers like the summer's breeze
In the canyon's echo I find my peace
In cold, fun Rockies
Champagne dreams on a sandy beach
With your hands in mine just out of reach
Stars above us, the lining conspire
In the glow of our fleeing desire
Whispers in the canyon calling me home
To a love so wild where I once rolled your dust
Ringed us like a summer's breeze
In the candy's echo of time
Whispers in the canyon call to me home
To a love so wild where I was from
Just fingers like summer trees
In the canyon's echo find my peace
