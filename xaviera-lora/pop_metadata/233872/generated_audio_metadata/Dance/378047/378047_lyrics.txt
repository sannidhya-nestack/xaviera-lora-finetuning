Yeah, hey, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead
Don't let nobody put you down
There ain't no reason to turn around
You're moving on the one way street
There ain't no chains on your feet
Dancing is the way I'm found
Moving up to higher ground
Dancing one direction
Leaving no exception
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead (yeah yeah yeah)
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead (I said keep moving)
So many people in this world
Think there ain't no way to turn
Living life with such confusion
What is real and what's illusion
Dancing is the way I found (yeah, yeah)
Moving up to higher ground
Dancing one direction
Leaving no exception
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Look straight ahead
Keep moving straight ahead (keep moving straight, straight ahead, oh yeah)
Look straight ahead
Keep moving straight ahead (keep moving, moving, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Look straight ahead
Keep moving straight ahead (keep moving, yeah)
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead
Everybody keep moving
I said keep moving
Woah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Look straight ahead
Straight ahead, yeah
Look straight ahead
Keep moving straight ahead
Yeah, yeah
Look straight ahead
Keep moving straight ahead
Oh, man, yeah, yeah
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead (I said keep moving straight ahead, oh yeah)
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead (I said keep moving, moving)
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead (I said keep moving, moving)
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead
Look straight ahead, keep moving straight ahead
