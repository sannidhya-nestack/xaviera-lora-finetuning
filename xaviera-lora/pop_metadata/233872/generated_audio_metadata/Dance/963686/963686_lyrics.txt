It's hard to be alive when you're not here
It's hard to be alright when you're not here
I feel the misery, I feel the jealousy, I feel everything
I didn't want to feel, oh it's real
Baby come on now
Let me know where you are before I lose it all
Let me know where you are before I lose it all
Let me know where you are before I lose it all
Oh before I lose it all
I feel the misery, I feel the jealousy, I feel everything
I didn't want to feel, oh it's real, oh oh
Baby come on now let me know where you are before I lose it all
Let me know where you are before I lose it all
Let me know where you are before I lose it all
Oh before I lose it all
Let me know where you are before I lose it all
Let me know where you are before I lose it all
Let me know where you are before I lose it, oh
Oh, before I lose it all
