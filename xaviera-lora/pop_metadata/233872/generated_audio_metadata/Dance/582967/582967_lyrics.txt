Reach up
To the sky above
Higher
Like you can't get enough
Reach up
Push the feeling higher
And then you bring it back
Once in a while, I can see your smile
And I know, I know that it's on its way
And it feels so right, till we wait
For the time and we feel the stars as they start to shine
So the night draws in and we've waited all week for this night to begin
Reach up to the sky above higher like you can't get enough
Reach up
Push the feeling higher
And then you bring it back
Reach up
To the sky above
Higher
Like you can't get enough
Reach up
Push the feeling higher
And then you bring it back
Back once again and I don't know when
We were here, here on our own at last
Like I knew it then, when the dawn starts to creep
Back into the sky and it's time to leap
We can still feel the drum
And it's pulling us right back to where we begun
Reach up
To the sky above higher
Like you can't get enough
Reach up
Push the feeling higher
And then you bring it back
Reach up
To the sky above higher
Like you can't get enough
Reach up
Push the feeling higher
And then you bring it back
Reach up
To the sky above, higher
Like you can't get enough, reach up
Push the feeling higher
And then you bring it back, reach up
To the sky above, higher
Like you can't get enough, reach up
Push the feeling higher
And then you bring it back
