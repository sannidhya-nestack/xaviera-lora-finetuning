I'm waking up, I'm taking chances tonight
Opening my eyes and I'm feeling alive
You give me all the strength that I need
And I wanna know if I can be by your side
I don't wanna be anywhere but by your side
I just wanna be here for you
Alive, alive, oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh, no, no, I feel alive tonight, yeah
Oh, no, no, I feel alive tonight
Waking up, I'm taking chances tonight
Opening my eyes and I'm feeling alive
You give me all the strength that I need
And I wanna know if I can be by your side
I don't wanna be anywhere but by your side
I just wanna be here for you
Alive, alive
Oh, no, no, I feel alive tonight, yeah
Oh, no, no, I feel alive tonight
