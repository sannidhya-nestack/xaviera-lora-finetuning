Let yourself be free, I wanna see you going crazy
Better come with me, when your world is getting crazy
Let yourself be free, I wanna see you going crazy
Better come with me, when your world is getting crazy
I feel good, I feel good, I feel good
I feel good, I feel good, I feel good
Alright, alright, come on
I feel good
Let yourself be free
I wanna see you going crazy
Better come with me
When your world is getting crazy
Let yourself be free
I wanna see you going crazy
Better come with me
When your world is getting crazy
I feel good, I feel good, I feel good
I feel good, I feel good, I feel good (When your world is getting crazy)
Alright, come on
I feel good, I feel good, I feel good
