Woke up with a headline, heart bolt through my chest
Coffee on the windowsill, hope getting dressed
Traffic's on the radio, beating like a drum
Life keeps throwing riddles, I keep humming along
I've been saving little sparks in a jar by the bed
Sticky note, pep talks, all the things we said
Every tiny victory stitched into the day
If the sky turns grey, I know just what to say
Ooh, when the world starts weighing heavy
I turn the dial until it's ready
Make it steady, count me in, one, two
I've got back pocket sunshine
Pull it up when the clouds roll in, na-na
Sing it like a lifeline
Bright enough to light my grid
Hand clap, hard time
Feel that rhythm under my skin
I've got back pocket sunshine
Oh-oh, I keep it on me, on me, on me
On repeat again
They train me on rain laughing down the block
Turning all the crosswalks into ticking clocks
But we don't need a miracle, just a little spark
Snap it like a Polaroid, glow in the dark
You and me, we're anchor strong in a paper boat town
Dancing through the puddles'til the doubt drowns out
Pocket full of chorus lines, ready when it's rough
Turn a Tuesday into fireworks, watch it go up
Ooh, when the doubt starts talking louder (ooh)
More sugar in the sour
Let the script reclaim the hour
Count it down, three, two
I've got back pocket sunshine
Pull it out when the clouds roll in
Na-na-na, sing it like a lifeline
Bright enough to light my grand handclap
Hard time, feel that rhythm under my skin
I got back pocket sunshine, oh-oh
Keep it on me, on me, on me, on repeat again (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Throw your worries in the rearview, let the daylight drive
Every heartbeat is a thank you for the simple staying alive
If the night tries to convince you that the morning won't begin
Check your denim for the daylight, let the little rays rush in
Hey, hey-oh, hey-oh, hold it in your hand
Oh, hey, oh, bright as a marching band
Snap, clap, kick, step, count it off with me
One time, two times, set it free
I got back, back pocket sunshine
Pull it out when the clouds roll in, na-na
Sing it like a lifeline, bright enough to light my grid
Handclap, hard time, feel that rhythm under my skin
I got back, pocket sunshine
Keep it on me, on me, on me, on repeat again
So when the storm says stay inside
I button hope up tight
Black pocket sunshine baby
Turn the volume up to high (nah nah)
Sing it like a lifeline (nah nah)
Till every shadow's thin (black on)
Black pocket sunshine
On repeat again and again (hey hey)
I won't repeat again
