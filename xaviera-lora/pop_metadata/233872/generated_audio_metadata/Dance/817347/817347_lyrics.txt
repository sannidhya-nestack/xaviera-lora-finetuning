You breathe me in, you breathe me out
I wanna scream, I wanna shout
You breathe me in, you breathe me out
I wanna scream, I wanna shout
All of me, just sing it for you
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Can you not see me when I'm standing here in front of you
I'm naked you see
You breathe me in you breathe me out
I wanna scream, I wanna shout
You breathe me in, you breathe me out
I wanna scream, I wanna shout
All but me, just sing it for you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
