Sandbox, you're not drinking today, eh-eh
I close off footsteps, so that you'll refrain, eh-eh
You and I linger where time seems to bend
The space is between where hours are spent
Cafe lights twinkle in the dusky haze
Your love gets us all lost in the dusky haze
Your love just sparkles through the autumn days
Central secrets in the fading light
Holding on to what feels right
When the clouds et to undress
We'll be dancing to the times on stairs
Under stars that refuse to set on our wall
When the clouds et
Even on the runway, runway
Sandbox you must bring yesterday, eh-eh
Echoes of footsteps fall down from the sky, eh-eh
You and I in the light of 6 to 10
Spaces between where hours are spent
Graffitied lights twinkle in the dusky haze
When the clouds et to warm their heads
We'll be dancing to the title sounds
All of the stars that refuse to set
In our world where the flashing's been set
In the space it beats again
Even though we're the closest in dreams
(La la la la la la la la la la la)
And we dance all day to run the heads
Where we can sing to the times old sands
And the stars they refuse to set in a world where the clouds et
That's so sad
Understands and refuses to say
In a world where the gods can't fit in
From this weekend that never fade
In the twilight of moments we made
Time is just a rhythm that we ignore
Together forever and evermore
