Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Pixel screen in the night
Game world's glowing, feel the thrill
Chase the beat inside the light
Electric rush, get your fill
You got me wired, you got me high
Pixels poppin' no deny
Let's go go go'til we drop
Got me in a retro high
Got me movin' like, movin' like, movin' like this
Got me movin' like, movin' like in the game bliss
Crank it up, crank it up, crank it up, crank it up
Now
Crank it up, crank it up, crank it up, crank it up
Now
Digital analog, take me away
We'll keep dancing'til the break of day
Digital analog, can't stop to play
We got it, we got it, feel the sway
Boom, boom, supersonic zoom, supersonic zoom
8-bit beat drops, let's fill the room, fill the room
Boom, boom, supersonic zoom, supersonic zoom
Heart thumps in sync with the bass bloom, bass bloom
Crank it up, crank it up, crank it up, crank it up now
Crank it up, crank it up, crank it up, crank it up now
Crank it up, crank it up, cranking up, crank it up now
Crank it up, crank it up, crankin' up, crankin' up
