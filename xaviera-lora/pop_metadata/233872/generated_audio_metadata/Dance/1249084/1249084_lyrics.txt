It's better than saying goodbye
It's better than saying goodbye
The train's passing by our bedroom window
It feels like there are tints on the wall
You try your best to reassure me
But lately I don't believe you at all
It takes time to build up some kind of mountain
It takes strength just to sit and watch it fall
If I can change your mind
Then I wanna change for you every single night
Pick my clothes, run my life
I wanna change for you every single night
It's better than saying goodbye
It's better than saying goodbye
I know that this all sounds self destructive
But I'll be the first to make it work
Use your hands and control me like a puppet
Because losing your love right now is worse
If I can't change your mind
Then I wanna change for you every single night
If I can't change your mind
Then I wanna change for you every single night
Pick my clothes, run my life
I wanna change for you every single night
Pick my clothes, run my life
I wanna change for you every single night
It's better than saying goodbye (I wanna change for you)
It's better than saying goodbye
It's better than saying goodbye
I'll change for you
It's better than saying goodbye
It's better than saying goodbye
I'll change for you
It's better than saying goodbye
I'll change for you
It's better than saying goodbye
