Going deeper
Going deep deeper
Going deeper
Going deep deeper
Going deeper
Don't make me wait
Going deep deeper
Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait
Fly by the weight of expectation
I gave and then I gave a little more
Don't know why love can't be the answer
Love will find a way, oh yeah, I'm sure
Tell me when you're done, how you feelin'
Tell me when I left you in the cold
Tell me why you're hiding the meanings
Waiting with a love I can't control
Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait
Going deeper, going deeper, going deeper
Goin' deep, deeper (oh, yeah)
Going deeper, going deep deeper
Going deeper, going deep deeper
