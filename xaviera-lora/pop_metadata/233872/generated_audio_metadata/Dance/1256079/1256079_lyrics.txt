Shining light through the night, heartbeats electric bright
Colors swirl in my mind, feel the rhythm rise
Dance in circles we spin, every step pulls us in
Touch the sky feel the rush, energy in our skin
All our game let it flow, feel the love let it show
Hurricane all around lift us up off the ground
Electric waves in the air, we are flying without care
Feel the spark, feel the pulse, in this moment we're whole
Nets and circles we spin, every step pulls us in
Every step pulls we spin, every step pulls us in
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Dance in circles we spin every step pulls us in
Every step pulls we spin every step pulls us in
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Dance in circles we spin every step pulls us in
Dance in circles we spin every step pulls us in
Every step pulls a rash energy in our skin
All we gain let it flow
Feel the love let it show
All we gain all around
Lift us up off the ground
Off the ground
Electric waves in the air, we are flying without care
Feel the spark, feel the pulse, in this moment we're whole
Dance in circles we spin, every step pulls us in
Every step pulls we spin, every step pulls us in
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Electric waves in the air, we are flying without care
Feel the spark, feel the pulse, in this moment we're whole
