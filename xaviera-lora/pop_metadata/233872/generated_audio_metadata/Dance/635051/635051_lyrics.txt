Devil, devil, devil, devil, devil, devil, devil
Devil, devil, devil, devil, devil, devil, devil
Oh boy is a good devil
Oh boy is a devil
He's casual and complicated
And each move is calculated
To look like it's so unplanned but I
I can't stand how he fakes his own mythology
Catch phrases, shrugs and mysteries
That's why I really don't want to like
I don't want to like him
Wake up with hell to pay
he works in a serious way
That boy is the devil that you know
he's reckless
But he's always in control
So help me, help me
He'll make me believe he's just a
Good boy with very bad dreams
I really don't want to like him
I'd rather not want to let myself go
Bare bones exposed in liquid lines
He combines bad plans with perfect time
He always finds the front of the line
I try to capture or characterize
But it's useless, I'm helpless, I'm hypnotized
And now
I can't stand how he puts on careless attitudes
He follows trends but never rules
That's why I really don't want to like
Don't want to let him make up with hell today
he works in the sunniest ways
That boy is the devil that you know
he's reckless but he's always in control
So help me, help me, don't make me believe
He's just a good boy with very bad dreams (very bad dreams)
I really don't want to like it (don't want to like it)
I'd rather not want to let myself go
Bare bones, exposed, do with liquid lines he combines
Bad plans with perfect time
That boy is the devil, ooh
That boy is the devil, boy is the devil
That you know, that you know
Ooh, that boy is the devil (boy is the devil)
He's charming, disarming, it's cold and it's cool
He drops notes, makes jokes, and he's writing the rules
The boy is the devil (boy is the devil)
Ooh, that boy is the devil
Boy is the devil that you know
