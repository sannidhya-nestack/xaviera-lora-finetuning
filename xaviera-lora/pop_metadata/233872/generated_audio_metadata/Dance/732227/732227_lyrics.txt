Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
A thousand dreams tonight
A sea of stars
You found the summer breeze and sent it to my heart
Dancing, dancing
The morning lights (just you and I)
The time to spy (keep dreaming too)
The stars they glide, twilight in your eyes
Oh
The moonlit sky tonight, the music plays
I've fallen under the spell and taken far away
(Keep dancing, dancing, dancing)
The morning light
(Just you and I)
The time drifts by
(Keep dreaming, dreaming, dreaming)
The stars take flight, twilight in your eyes
Ooh
Keep dancing, just you and I
Keep dreaming, yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep dancing'til the morning lights
Just you and I, the time to smile
Keep dreaming'til the stars ignite
Twilight in your eyes
Ooh, ah
Keep dancing, just you and I
Keep dreaming, yeah yeah yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
