Under the golden sky, we just laugh and play
Hearts intertwined tonight, chase the world away
Feel the gentle breeze, kisses in the air
In your arms I freeze, lost without a care
Eternal love we share, in the moon's soft glow
An endless affair, together we grow
Through the highs and lows
With my heart exposed (ah-ah-ah)
In your gaze unknown (ah-ah-ah)
Forever we chose (ah-ah-ah)
Starlight in your eyes
Whispered soft and sweet
Chase the love that lies
Every heartbeat
A tunnel of love we share
In the moons soft glow
An endless affair
Together we grow
Through the highs and lows
With my heart exposed
In your gaze I know
Forever we chose
Starlight in your eyes
Whispered soft and sweet
Chase the love that lies
Every heartbeat, beat
Eternal love we share
In the moon's soft glow
An endless affair
Together we grow
Oh, oh, oh, oh
