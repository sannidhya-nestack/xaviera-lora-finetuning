Neon lights, electric nights
Your eyes on me, it feels so right
We're dancing close, skin on skin
This moment's ours, let it begin
No need to think, just feel the beat
Our bodies move in perfect sync
The world outside just fades away
In this moment we're here to stay
Physical, chemical, magical
Our love's a dance that's radical
Don't need tomorrow, just need tonight
Together we're dynamite
Levitating, gravitating
Our hearts are syncopating
This rhythm's taking over me
Baby can't you see
Midnight strikes, but we don't stop
Our loves are high, we're on top
No looking back, no regrets
This passion's real, no safety nets
One touch from you, I'm on fire
Can't get enough, you're my desire
The heat between us is so intense
Let's lose control, et pretence
Physical, chemical, magical
Our love's a dance that's radical
Don't need tomorrow just need tonight
Together we're dynamite
Levitating, gravitating
Our hearts are syncopating
This rhythm's taking over me
Baby can't you see?
Baby can't you see?
In this moment we're infinite
Time stands still when you're with it
Don't wanna come down from this high
Let's touch the stars you and I
Physical, chemical, magical
Our love's a dance that's radical
Don't need tomorrow just need tonight
Together we're dynamite
Levitating, gravitating
Our hearts are syncopating
This rhythm's taking over me
Baby can't you see
When you catch a seed
