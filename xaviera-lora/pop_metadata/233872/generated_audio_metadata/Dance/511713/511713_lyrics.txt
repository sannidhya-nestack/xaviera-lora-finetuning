I'm over here, ooh, I'm over here
I'm over here, I'm watching you
Flirt a little and talk to you
That's just what I wanna do
I can't cool down
Damn it's building up inside me
What to do is just spin around in my head
I can only think my way through to you
Because I can't do anything
I know, I know what I wanna do
But what I wanna do will never come
What I wanna do will never come
Hey I'm over here I'm watching you
Come on just go my way
Flirt a little and talk to me
That's just what I want
See you watching me from over there
Should I just throw you away
Flirt a little and talk to you
That's just what I wanna do
I try my moves on the dance floor and work it everywhere
But every time my head spins around I go numb
Some other day maybe though I know that my feet ain't gonna move
Maybe too late to get you but that's just what I wanna do
That's just what I wanna do
Hey, I'm over here, I'm watching you
Come on, just go my way
Flirt a little and talk to me
That's just what I want
See you watching me from over there
Should I just go your way
Flirt a little and talk to you
That's just what I wanna do
Hey, I'm over here, I'm watching you
Should I just go your way?
Flirt a little and talk to you
That's just what I wanna do
That's just what I wanna do
I can't cool down
I see her swaying on the dance floor
Movin' her body and damn I think that she's hot
I want her
I need her
Wanna lift from my toes to my fingertips
Girl, can you hear me?
That's just what I wanna do
I want you
I need you
That's just what I wanna do
Girl, I see you swaying on the dance floor
Hey, I'm over here
On your lips, from my toes to my fingertips
I'm over here, I'm watching you move
Flirt a little and talk to you
That's just what I wanna do
I'm over here, I'm watching you
Come on, just go my way
Flirt a little and talk to me
That's how love's supposed to be
You're watching me from over there
Should I just go your way?
Flirt a little and talk to you
That's just what I wanna do
I'm over here, I'm watching you
Come on just come away
Flirt a little and talk to me
That's just what I want
See you watching me from over there
Should I just call you away
Flirt a little and talk to you
That's just what I wanna do
Oh that's just what I wanna do
Girl you got me moving
That's just what I wanna do
