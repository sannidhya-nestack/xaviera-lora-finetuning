You can shoot me right up to the sky
You take me high, you take me high, you take me high
You got a hold of me, I gotta stop pretending
And when you're next to me, that buzz is never ending
Just like I took one of them little happy pills
You make me, make me feel, like I scored a hundred mil
You can shoot me right up to the sky
You can shoot me right up to the sky
A life so complicated, I'm glad you're by my side
I know we're gonna make it,'cause you do me right
Just the sound of your voice is like ecstasy
And I'm gonna give you every little bit of me
I'm the one that you run to when you wanna cry
But you're the one that I come to when I wanna fly
I'm hooked on you
I got a game I'm fixin'
A drunk of love
A seriously addicted
Just like I took one of them little happy pills
You make me make me feel
Like I scored a hundred mil
You can shoot me right up to the sky
You can shoot me right up to the sky
With wine
Like I'm doped up, you take me up, up
Like you need me, roll me up, up
You touch me a crime, a roller coaster ride
You wanna take me high, well I can do the time
Like a twisted butterfly, a million colors fly
You can shoot me right up to the sky
You can shoot me right up to the sky
You can shoot me right up to the sky
You take me high
You take me high-ee-ah-ah
You can shoot me right up to the sky
You take me high
You can shoot me right up to the sky
You take me high
You take me high-ee-ah-ah
You can shoot me right up to the sky
We're wild
