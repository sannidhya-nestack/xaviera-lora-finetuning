Hey everybody, look around you
Do you see what you want to see?
Oh think about it
Do you know what it's like to be free?
Leaders pretend they are leading
Us somewhere we need to be
They lie, they cheat, they say they're only human
We excuse them from truth and honesty
Afraid to upset status quo
We sit back and watch the seat grow
They hold us captive with lies
They steal our hope'til it dies
Where is the passion? Where is the life?
To fight for the good, to fight for the right
Where is the passion? Where is the peace?
We settle for less, we've otten our dreams
Where is our passion?
Where is our passion?
Despair is at every turn
Why do we never learn?
We gave them their power, we can take it away
We must stop the ones who betray
We long to feel the sun shining on our face
We've got to make this world a safe and sacred place
Where is the passion? Where is the light?
To fight for the good, to fight for the right
Where is the passion? Where is the fire?
Of kindness and love
Have we lost desire?
Where is the passion?
Where is the peace?
We selfless
We've otten our dreams
Where is our passion?
Where, where, where, where is our passion?
We long to feel the sun shining on our face
We've got to make this world a safe and sacred place
Where is the passion? Where is the light?
To fight for the good, to fight for the right
Where is the passion? Where is the fire?
Of kindness and love
Have we lost desire?
Where is the passion?
Where is the peace?
We've settled for less
We've otten our dreams
Where is our passion?
Where is our passion?
Where, where, where is our passion?
Where is the light to fight for the good?
To fight for the right?
Where is the passion?
Where is the fire of kindness and love?
Have we lost desire?
Where is the passion?
Where is the peace?
We've settled for less
We've otten our dreams
Where is our passion?
Where is our passion?
