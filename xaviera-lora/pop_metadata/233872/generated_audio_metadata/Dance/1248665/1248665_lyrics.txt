Towns that go the street
Based on them feel the beat
City lights and me and you
Summer night just me and you
Hands are high we touch the sky
Dancing under stars so bright
Heartbeat sinking through for two
Electric love beneath the moon
Feel the night come alive
With you by my side
We're unstoppable
In this summer nightline
Laughter echoes through the air
Carefree moments we can share
Every second feels so new
Magic happens, me and you
Time flies when we're together
Let's make this moment forever
Dance'til the dawn breaks through
Under stars just me and you
Feel the light come alive
With you by my side
We're unstoppable
In this summer nightline
Oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
In this summer life I
Feel the night come alive
With you by my side
We're both stars, oh, oh
In this summer night, night
Oh, oh
Our laughter echoes through the air
Carefree moments we can share
Every second feels so new
Magic happens, me and you
Time flies when we're together
Let's make this moment forever
Dance'til the dawn breaks through
Under stars, just me and you
Feel the light, come alive
With you by my side
We're unstoppable
In this summer night, babe
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
In this summer night, babe
Feel the night come around
Waking, by my side
We're unstoppable
In this summer night, I
Our eyes when we're together
Let's make this moment forever
Dance till the dawn breaks through
