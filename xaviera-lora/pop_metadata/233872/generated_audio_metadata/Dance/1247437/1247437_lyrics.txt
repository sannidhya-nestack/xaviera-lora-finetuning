Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-fun
Can you hear my voice?
So what are you thinking of?
I wasn't breaking the silence tonight (tonight)
Alright (alright)
The moments were building inside
It's getting so deep to share
And finally got him on my mind, I'm so alright (alright)
Can they give me love all of my life?
In this world we're both alone
We're a castaway
Papas, papas, pa
Can you hear their voice?
And when we're fucked on board
How you guess we were?
Papas, papas, pa
Can you hear their voice?
So what are you thinking of?
I would've bring in the silence tonight
The moments we're building inside
Is giving something to share
And don't let anybody know how it all felt
Alright, I think I'm here to move my life
And they fall, fall, fall, fall, fall (fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, fall)
Can you hear their voice? (Can you hear their voice?)
And they fall, fall, fall, fall, fall (fall, fall, fall, fall, fall)
When it gets too rough
F-F-F-F-Fall
Can you hear it in our voice?
Let the night unfold
Our faces keep on dancing through the streets where you lie
And if there is hope somewhere
