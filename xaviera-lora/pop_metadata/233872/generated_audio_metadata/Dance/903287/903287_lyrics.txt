I guess I learned my lesson, I see that you're a blessing
I think that it's time that I finally quit messing around
Feel like gold in a mine I found
Let's get out of here, let's hit up the town
Let's climb mountains with no fear of looking down
You know when I travel the world with you
Mommy know it's true, let's fly
Sail across the ocean blue
Gotta focus on the present and not where the end is
Just follow where the wind blows and go where nobody knows
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
It'll be a picture perfect, come on you know it's worth it
Just let it all go, yeah go with the flow
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, uh
I guess I learned my lesson, I see that you're a blessing
I think that it's time that I finally quit messing around
Get that golden mind I found
Let's get out of here, let's hit up the town
Let's climb mountains with no fear of looking down
Don't wanna travel the world with you, I know it's true
Let's fly, sail across the ocean blue
Gotta focus on the present and not where the end is
Just follow where the wind blows and go where nobody knows
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
It'll be a picture perfect, come on you know it's worth it
Just let it all go, yeah go with the flow
et about the past, I wanna make this last
There's a beautiful tomorrow, so et about yourself
There's no need to be afraid, there's not much else to say
Just accept a little change and embrace a new wave
You let go, you'll find life out
And embrace a new wave, you let go, you'll find life out
Sail across the ocean blue
I'm not gonna let you go, I'm not gonna let you go, I'm not gonna let you go, I'm not gonna let you go, I'm not gonna let you go, no, no, no, no, no, no
Let's fly, sail across the ocean blue
