Losing common sense
Feels like we've grown apart
Feels like we've grown apart
But damn this long distance
But we still love with purple hearts yeah
Love me like a riot
Now be your grenade
Bombs away bombs away tonight
From the other side of the island
I won't sleep alone
Cause you and I were under the same sky
Running out of words to say how much I need you
Running out of ways to show you that I care
I'm so done trying to find new ways to tell you
But you know, yeah you know
I miss you just come home
Just come home
Won't you come, won't you come, won't you come home?
Yeah, just come home
Oh, I miss you, just come home
I've seen it get shot down
Time and time again
Yeah, I've seen it burning down
But I know we're not like them
Love me like a riot
Now be your grenade bombs away, bombs away tonight
From the other side of the island
I won't sleep alone'cause you and I were under the same sky
Running out of words to say how much I need you
Running out of ways to show you that I care
I'm so done tryna find new ways to tell you
But you know, yeah you know I miss you
Just come home, just come home
Won't you come, won't you come, won't you come home?
Oh, yeah, just come home
Oh, I miss you, just come home
The battle for your heart is won
But still you are away from me
Still you are away from me
Waiting for the white flag
That eventually will set us free
Running out of words to say how much I need you
Running out of ways to show you that I care
I'm so done trying to find new ways to tell you
But you know, yeah you know I miss you
Just come home
Won't you come, won't you come, won't you come home?
Yeah, just come home
Oh, I miss you, just come home
