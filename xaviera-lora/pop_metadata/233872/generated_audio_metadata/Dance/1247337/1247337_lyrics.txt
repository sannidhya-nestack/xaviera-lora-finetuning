Find a magic lamp in the desert sand
Rub it once and out you spring
Genuine smile said I've got three
Wishes for you so what will they be?
Three wishes dreams come true
What's your heart telling you?
In the glow of this night
Three wishes shining bright
Three wishes, the end
Magic moments everywhere
First wish for love that will never fade
Second, courage when I'm afraid
Third, for peace in a world so grand
Three wishes granted with the wave of your hand
Three wishes, dreams come true
What's your heart telling you
In the glow of this night
Three wishes shining bright
Three wishes in the air
Magic moments everywhere
Three wishes in the air
Magic moments everywhere
First wish for love that will never fade
Second for courage when I'm afraid
Third peace in a world so grand
Three wishes granted with the wave of your hand
Three wishes dreams come true
What's your heart telling you
In the glow of this night
Three wishes shining bright
Three wishes in the air
Magic moments everywhere
As the stars align and the night is still
Grateful for the magic and the thrill
In the heart of dreams where the wishes flow
Three wishes granted now I know
Three wishes dreams come true
What's your heart telling you
In the glow of this night
Three wishes shining bright
Three wishes in the air
Magic moments everywhere
Three wishes in the night
Guiding us with their light
