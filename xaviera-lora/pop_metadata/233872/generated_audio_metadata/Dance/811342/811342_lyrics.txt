So vivid, real, like I'm still there
Living all the things
Desperate to et in my new life
Ooh, and all I
All I wanna do is get some peace and free my mind
All these things are so deep inside me
All these things
Keep on haunting me, taunting me
I wish I could move on
I hope I can be strong
I wanna be free of this pain
I want to et
I don't wanna regret
Gotta do what's right for me
Move on
Be strong of this pain
et, regret for me
All these things that I feel
All these things that I see
Looking out from the inside
Looking out from the inside
