I can barely sleep'cause you were always on my mind
I can hardly breathe, I'm so afraid to lose the time
We were so big, we were lovers
We were superstars undercover
We shared so many things together
Thought our love would last forever
Don't leave me, no don't leave me, don't leave me
Your love kept my heart on fire
It burned with desire
But our world is falling down without you
You kept my heart on fire
It burned with desire
But our world is falling down
Tell me where is the man who really cares what I feel
Tell me where is the face that removes all my fears
Can you turn back the time to relieve my sad heart
I wish that you could deny
What you all have done in your life
Don't leave me, no don't leave me
Don't leave me, no don't leave me
Don't leave me
Your love kept my heart on fire (kept my heart on fire)
It burned with desire (it burned with desire)
And our world is falling down (falling down)
Falling down without you
You kept my heart on fire (you kept my heart on fire)
It burned with desire (it burned with desire)
Now it is falling down (now it is falling down)
Falling down, falling down without you
Falling down without you
Your love kept my heart on fire (kept my heart on fire)
It burned with desire (it burned with desire)
My world is falling down, falling down without you
You kept my heart on fire (you kept my heart on fire)
It burned with desire (it burned with desire)
My world is falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down (falling down, falling down)
Falling down without you
Girl, girl, kept my heart on fire (kept my heart on fire)
If I remember this life (If I remember this life)
My world is falling down
My world is falling down without you
You kept my heart on fire (kept my heart on fire)
It burned with desire (burned with desire)
My world is falling down, falling down
Your love (your love)
Kept my heart on fire (kept my heart on fire)
It burned with desire (burned with desire)
The world is falling down, falling down without you
You kept my heart on fire, it burned with desire
The world is falling down, falling down, your love
Kept my heart on fire (kept my heart on fire)
A burn with desire (a burn with desire)
My world is falling down (my world is falling down)
Without you
