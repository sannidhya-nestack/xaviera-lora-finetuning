I'm rolling, rolly polly
It's effortless, I just undergo it
I'm thinking of tumbleweed
I keep on going in perpetual motion
Nothing's gonna weigh me down, I can only get higher
Nothing's gonna weigh me down, I can only get higher
I'm floating by
Drifting on the southern winds like clouds in the sky
Aimlessly and weightless
I'm flying on and on always had these wings
But I never knew where I moved them
Up and down, I've been to places I'd never heard of
Ooh, nothing's gonna weigh me down, I can only get higher
Ooh, nothing's gonna weigh me down, I can only get higher
I'm floating by
Drifting on the southern winds like clouds in the sky
Aimlessly in weightless
I'm floating by
Drifting on the southern winds like clouds in the sky
Aimlessly in weightless
I'm flying on and on always had these wings but I never knew it
I moved them up and down I've been to places I'd never heard of
I'm floating by
Drifting on the southern winds like clouds in the sky
Aimlessly and weightless I'm floating by (I'm floating by)
Nothing's gonna wake me now (Drifting on the southern winds like clouds in the sky)
Nothing's gonna wake me now
Aimlessly and only get higher
I'm floating by (nothing's gonna weigh me down)
Drifting on like a southern wind (only get higher)
Like clouds in the sky (nothing's gonna weigh me down)
Aimlessly and only get higher
