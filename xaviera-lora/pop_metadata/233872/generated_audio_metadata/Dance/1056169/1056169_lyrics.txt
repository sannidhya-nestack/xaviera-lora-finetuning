Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, you ready?
I'm ready, are you ready?
Ooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, hey
Come on, are you ready?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, are you ready?
I'm on, you wanna?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm gonna
Come on, tease with your uncertainty
Thrill me with the game
You don't know what you do to me
I wanna see your fame
Touching me emotionally
Exciting all the same
Making me go crazy
It's you I have to blame
I don't need temptation
Come on and light my flame
Take me with you baby
You're driving me insane
Gonna make you feel good, it's understood, ooh
I know I should, if only I could, ooh
You gotta read the signs
You don't wanna fall behind, behind
You just gotta see the signs
And read between the lines
What line, what time, what sign is it gonna be now?
You're fine, you shine, you're mine if you wanna be now
You gotta read the signs, you don't wanna fall behind behind
Exposing internally, I know you feel the same
Cool and calm externally, it's all part of the game
Refraining's the adversity, not to be entertained
I know controversially, this love will ascertain
Giving to the pleasure, feelings learn again
Living for the moment, it's where I will remain
Gonna give it to you, that's what I'm gonna do, ooh
I'll see it through, you know you want me too, ooh
You gotta read the signs, don't wanna fall behind, behind
You just gotta see the signs
And read between the lines
You're shy, tongue tied
Don't hide away from me now
Just try, don't lie
My guy's what you wanna be now, ooh
You gotta read the signs
You don't wanna fall behind, behind
Ew
