Cool cats taking all the cool back
She's a cool cat taking all the cool back
Cool cats taking all the cool back
She's a cool cat
Taking all the cool back
Blows cold, she's hot, you know she blows your mind
On fire, can't stop, she's burning all the time
She's hot, you can't stop
You freeze, dead cold, she's gonna melt you right
The chill, the thrill, cold turns to nice
Too cold
Too old, she's hot
You can't stop, she's hot
Cool cats, she's a cool cat
Cool back, taking it all back
Cool cats, she's a cool cat
Cool back, taking the cool right back home
Cool cats
Taking all the cool back
Cool cats
Taking all the cool back
Blows cold, she's hot
You know she blows your mind
On fire, can't stop
She's burning off the time
She's hot
You freeze dead cold, she's gonna melt you right
The chill, the thrill, colder than ice
She's hot
You freeze dead cold, she's gonna melt you right
Cool cats, she's a cool cat
Cool back, taking it all back
Cool cats, she's a cool cat
Cool back, taking the cool right back home
Taking the cool right back home
Taking a cool ride back home
Cool cats
Cool cats
Cool cats
Cool cats
