Morning breaks with shades of grey
Whispers of the night still in play
We dance beneath the starless sky
Promises made, no need to try
Streets echo with our laughter's trace
Memories that time can't erase
Your silhouette against the morning light
Holds the secrets of our night
In the shades of yesterday we find our truth
In the echoes of our youth
When the world was just a canvas waiting for our touch
In those shades of yesterday we loved so much
In the shades of yesterday, we'll find our truth
In the echoes of our youth
When the world was just a candle just waiting for our touch
In the shades of yesterday, we loved so much
Sunset colors bleeding tonight
Holding on to what felt right
Your eyes, a mirror disguise
Reflecting stars undisguised
In those shades of yesterday you'll find our truth
In the echoes of our youth
When the world is just a canvas waiting for our touch
In those shades of yesterday
We loved so much, so much
To where hearts beat what words can't say
Let's dance again where shadows play
Live in the lingering light of yesterday
In the shades of yesterday we find our truth
In the echoes of our youth
When the world was just a canvas waiting for our touch
In those shades of yesterday
We loved so much, so much
To our hearts beat what words can't say
Let's dance again where shadows play
In the lingering light of yesterday
