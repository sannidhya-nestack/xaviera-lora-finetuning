I see her body moving but I feel impressed
Haven't even met her but I'm feeling so attached
Obsessed with her body in that sexy dress
Can't regret she's the one that I can't et (can't regret)
She's the one that I can't et
In bed she biting the pillow but she can't resist
Cause she never had a type like this
All the types she gone leave and she gone to dismiss
Before she suck it, lick it, give it a kiss
Her morning is crazy but doesn't wanna quit
We on a different level we ain't ready to switch
We ain't gonna mess with spots mainly on the list
If I know this shit done let your friends come in the mix
When your lips touch me I lose control
I know you want me to take you to my spot
