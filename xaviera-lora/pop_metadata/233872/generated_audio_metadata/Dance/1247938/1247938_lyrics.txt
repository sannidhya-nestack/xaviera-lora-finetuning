Morning sun is rising, casting golden light
Dew upon the flowers, sparkling so bright
In the fields of daisies where the soft wind sighs
We spend our days in laughter catching butterflies
Catching butterflies in the summer sky
Moments like the breeze as they flutter by
Colors in the air pure and true
Catching butterflies, me and you
Running through the meadow, hearts so full of glee
Chasing all our dreams underneath the tree
Every winged wonder, a sweet surprise
In the dance of nature, catching butterflies
Catching butterflies in the summer sky
Moments like the breeze as they flutter by
Colors in the air pure and true
Catching butterflies, me and you
By the river's edge where the lilies grow
In the quiet beauty where the soft winds blow
Every fleeting moment a cherished prize
In the golden sunlight catching butterflies
Catching butterflies in the summer sky
Moments like the breeze as they flutter by
Colors in the air pure and true
Catching butterflies meeting you
As the twilight fades and the stars appear
Memories of today will keep us near
In the hush of evening as the fireflies rise
Dreaming of tomorrow catching butterflies
As the twilight fades and the stars appear
Memories of today will keep us near
In the hush of evening as the fireflies rise
Dreaming of tomorrow catching butterflies
In the night where dreams take flight
Catching butterflies feels so right
Every memory shining bright
Catching butterflies in the night
