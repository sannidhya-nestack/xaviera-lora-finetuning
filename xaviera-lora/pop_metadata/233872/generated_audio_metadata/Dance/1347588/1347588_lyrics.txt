Uh-huh, yeah, OMG Becky, is that? (Attention)
Cue the spotlight, I'm comin' in hot
Heels clickin', lips pop, make it look tank
Struttin' like a wifi, sittin' in full bars
So fab, I don't walk, I got past cars
Gloss too loud, gotta turn it down
Snap so fierce, I just broke the town
Credit card gold, nails like chrome
Postin' thirst traps for my throne at home
Got more sparkle than a disco ball
And if you blink too quick, you'll miss me
Make it look (ooh girl, she flashy)
Turnin' heads like I'm tryna start traffic
Make it look
Oh snap she wild
I got that mall walk rich chick smile
Make it uh make it uh make it look
Snap a pic can't crop this hook
Make it uh make it uh make it look
Serve it up hot fresh shook
I'm the algorithm dream all likes no stress
Even my haters low key obsessed
Talk fast walk fast sass on blast
Pulling more clout than a rockets mask
Glitter in my teeth yeah that's intentional
Lip gloss so dimensional
Style from the future vibe from the mall
You tried to roast girl I've heard it all
Like, seriously?
Did you just not notice me walking in?
Honey, this outfit's got its own zip code
You ain't ready for this kind of fabulous
Make ya laugh!
Make ya look
Work that light
Slayin' even when I'm outta sight
Make ya look
Snap that pic
Even my throwaways hit real quick (Make ya uh)
Make ya uh
Make ya look
Pop like soda, can't overlook (Uh)
Make ya uh
Make it look zoom in tight, don't miss the hook
Don't chase trends, I make the wave, style so bold it misbehaves
Pink Corvette in the parking spot, pullin' up just to show what you're not
Yeah, make it look, front page fab in every book
Wink, blow, kiss, click that pic, just another day bein' that hot chick hit
Now go ahead, try not to look
Make it look, ooh girl she flashy
Turning heads like I'm tryna start traffic
Make it look, oh snap she wild
I got that mall walk rich chick smile
Make it uh, make it uh, make it look
Snap a pic can't crop this hook
Make it uh, make it uh, make it look
Serve it up hot fresh shook
Make it look
Work that lie, slayin' even when I'm outta sight
Make it look, snap that pic
Even my throwaways hit real quick, uh, make it, uh
Make it look pop like soda, can't overlook, uh, make it, uh
Make it look zoom in tight, don't miss the hook
