Caught your eye and tell me I'll be
A fleeing glance, a mystery
Travelers lost in reverie
In that moment, you and me
Suitcases and boarding calls
Echoes down the endless halls
In this place where no one stalls
Found a loved in Elephant Falls
Airport romance where our stories start
In the fleeting seconds you stole my heart
Among the gates in distant lands
We found love where no one plans
Waiting at the baggage claim
Whispered soft you said my name
In this rush we play the game
Two souls caught in passions flame
Fright attendance overhead
Announcements blend with words unsaid
In your smile the world we share
In this journey we're a land
Airport bowling's where our stories start
In the fleeting seconds you stole my heart
Among the gates in distant lands
We found love where no one plans
Waiting at the baggage claim
Whisper soft you said my name
In this rush we play the game
Two souls caught in passion's flame
Flight attendants overhead
The announcements blend with words unsaid
In your smile the world we share
In this journey we're all led
Layovers and delayed flights
Moments stolen in the night
In your arms the world feels right
In this space we take our flight
Runway lights and engines roar
Promises of what's in store
In this love we both explore
Every kiss we soar
Airport moments where our stories start
In the fleeting seconds you stole my heart
Among the gates and distant lands
We found love where no one plans
