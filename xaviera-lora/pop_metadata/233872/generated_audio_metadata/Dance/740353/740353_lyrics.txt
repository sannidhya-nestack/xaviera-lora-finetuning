All we have is one night for us to have
All I want to feel is your touch and your love around me
You live at night I see in you breathing the energy
Push, pull, love stay together we
Push, pull, love stay together we
Push, pull, love stay together we
Push our love when worlds collide
When worlds collide
When worlds collide
When worlds collide
For how long you live that night I see you breathing the energy
All we have is one night for us to share
All I want to feel is your touch and your love around me
You live at night I see you breathing the energy
Push, pull, love stay together
We push, pull, love stay together
We push, pull, love stay together
We push our love when worlds collide
When worlds collide
When worlds collide
Worlds collide
Around
You leave at night I see you dreaming the energy
