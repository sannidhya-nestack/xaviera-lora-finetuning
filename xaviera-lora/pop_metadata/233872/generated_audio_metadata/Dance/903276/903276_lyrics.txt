Always days were all the same
Always looking for someone else to blame
For the mistakes that we'll make it in our lives and
For the truth that we always wanna hide
I'm tired of living the same dreams
For them to shatter all over me
Let my emotions get the better of me
A never ending epic of repeats
Pick myself up off the ground and dust off once again
Set me free, this time I pray
From this deja vu that consumes my days
Give me sight to ascertain what's real
To stop this parasailing me
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Always days, we're all the same
Always looking for someone else to blame
All the mistakes that we're making in our lives and
For the truth that we always wanna hide
I'm tired of living the same dreams
For them to shatter all over me
Let my emotions get the better of me
A never ending epic of repeats
Pick myself up off the ground
And dust off once again
Set me free, this time I pray
From this déjà vu that consumes my days
Give me a sign to ascertain what's real
To stop this carousel and let me in
Na na na na na, na na na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na, na na na na, Na na na na, na na na na, Na na na na, Na na na na, Na na na na
All these days, we're all the same
Always looking for someone else to blame
All the mistakes that we're making in our lives and
For the truth that we always want to hide
I'm tired of living the same dreams
For them to shatter all over me
Let my emotions get the better of me
A never ending epic of repeats
Set me free
This time I pray
From this deja vu
That consumes my days
Give me signs to ascertain what's real
To stop this carousel and let me in
Na na na na na, na na na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na, na na na na, Na na na na, na na na na, Na na na na, na na na na, Na na na na, Na na na na, Na na na na, Na na na na, Na na na na, Na na na na, Na na na na, Na na na, Na na na, Na na na, Na na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na
