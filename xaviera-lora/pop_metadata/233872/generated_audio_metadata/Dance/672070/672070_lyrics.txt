If I wanted to change the world from the disco
And if my world never evolved around the disco
Let's go
If I wanted to change the world, I would from the disco
If I said so, would you follow?
And if my world never evolved around the disco
If I let go
Would you follow?
Bet that I bet you would
I bet you could
I bet you'd run away with me if I should ever
Take your hand when you're falling
everybody hits the ground sometimes
Everybody needs to change somehow
So if I wanted to change the world I would from the disco
If I said so, would you follow?
And if my world never revolved around the disco
If I let go
