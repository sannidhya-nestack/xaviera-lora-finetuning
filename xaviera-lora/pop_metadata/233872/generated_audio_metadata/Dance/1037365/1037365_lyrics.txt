I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why
Baby, I need your touch
Un ettable kisses
Girl, there's never too much
That's why I want all of the pieces (all of the pieces)
We lose control, no one sees that (no one sees that)
Baby, tell me what it's like being perfectly bad and
Tell me how it tastes goodbye when she's leaving you first, babe
But I know you know it, I know you know it, babe
Nothing hurts like love
Nothing hurts like
Nothing hurts like love
Nothing hurts like love
Nothing hurts like
Nothing hurts like love
Don't know why
Don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
When she's leaving you first, babe
But I know you know it, I know you know it, babe
Nothing hurts like love, nothing hurts like
Nothing hurts like love
Nothing hurts like love
Nothing hurts like
Nothing hurts like love
Don't know why
Don't know why
Don't know why
Don't know why
Don't know why
Don't know why
Don't know why
Don't know why
Don't know why
But I know you know why
Nothing hurts like love
Nothing hurts like
Nothing hurts like love
Nothing hurts like love
Nothing hurts like
Nothing hurts like love
