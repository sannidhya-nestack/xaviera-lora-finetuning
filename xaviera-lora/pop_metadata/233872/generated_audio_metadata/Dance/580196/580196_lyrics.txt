I just wanna peel away, wanna break free
Wanna spend my time with you
Watching the sunset, driving out west
That's what I wanna do
I say we just go back and live a simple life
Staring out the window, soaking up the sky with you
And when we wake up in the morning
We'll be someplace we've never been
Keep on going through the desert
You drive and I'll hold your hand
Oh the moon's so bright
It's like a street light
In the middle of nowhere
Feels so nice
Staring out the window
Soaking up the sky with you
Honky tongues, rest stops, tube tops, cowboy boots, ice cream, whiskey breath
Again I kiss your neck, sleeping bag, night sky, awake and I don't mind
We'll be rolling down the windows, living life large
Let's crank up the radio and play our favorite songs
Listen to the wind blow, a million stars aglow
We'll be rolling down the windows, soaking up the sky with you
I just wanna peel away, I wanna break free
Wanna spend my time with you
Watching the sunset, driving out west
That's what I wanna do
I say we just go back and live a simple life
Staring out the window, soaking up the sky with you
And we'll be rollin' down the windows
Livin' life large (Livin' life large)
Let's crank up the radio (crank up the radio)
And play our favorite songs
And listen to the wind blow
A million stars glow
Rolling down the windows
And soaking up the sky with you
Soaking up the sky
Honky tonks, rest stops, tube tops, cowboy boots, ice cream, whiskey breath
Again I kiss your neck, sleeping bag, night sky, awake and I don't mind
We'll be rolling down the windows
