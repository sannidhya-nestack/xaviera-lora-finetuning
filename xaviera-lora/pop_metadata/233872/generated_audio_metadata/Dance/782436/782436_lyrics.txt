Check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out
I wanna dance, dance, dance, dance all the time
I wanna go, go, go, go to that side
I wanna feel, feel, feel, feel your skin in mine
I wanna glow, glow, glow, glow, glow your mind
Let me see your body flow
Let me see your body flow
Check it out, check it out
I don't wanna be alone tonight
Let me see your body float
Let me see your body float
Check it out, check it out
I don't wanna see you cry tonight
You can't deny
Can't touch the sky
Can't feel so high
Let me hear you say
Hey you can't deny
Can't touch the sky
Can't feel so high
Let me see your hands
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na, na, na na na, na, na, na, na, na, no no no no
I wanna dance, dance, dance, dance all the time
I wanna go, go, go, go to that side
I wanna feel, feel, feel, feel your skin in mine
I wanna glow, glow, glow, glow, glow your mind
Let me see your body flow
Let me see your body flow
Check it out, check it out
I don't wanna be alone tonight
Let me see your body float
Let me see your body float
Check it out, check it out
I don't wanna see you cry tonight
Can't tonight
Can't touch the sky
Can't feel so high
Let me hear you say hey-oh
Can't tonight
Can't touch the sky
Can't feel so high
Let me see your hands
Na na na na na na na
Let me see your hands
