Let it out, home
Let it out, home
Let it out, home
Gotta keep moving on
Let it out, home
Gotta keep moving on
Makes me feel alright
Well, well, what a feeling
Well, well, well, well, what a feeling
Well, makes me feel alright
Far away when the day meets the night
Makes me feel alright, hey
When the day trips away and the night
Makes me feel alright
Whoa, whoa, what a feeling
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what a feeling
Whoa, makes me feel alright
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, gotta keep moving now
Whoa, gotta keep moving now
Makes me feel alright
Well, well, what a feeling
Well, oh, well, well, what a feeling
Well, makes me feel alright
Makes me feel alright
