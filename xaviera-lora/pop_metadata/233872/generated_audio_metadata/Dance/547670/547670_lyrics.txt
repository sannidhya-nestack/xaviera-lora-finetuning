When I look at other boys, their talk is just a noise
Their words are just a game, I don't care to play, no
I've got you in my sight, I bet your kiss is nice
Intensified me off the Richter scale
When all those other girls tell you they'll give the world
Don't you believe it baby I'm the one you need
I'll feed your hungry soul
I'll make you lose control
Your style's amazing
You're one of a kind
So hot, so hot
I'm falling to my knees
So hot, so hot
One hundred degrees
So hot, so hot
Baby, take it slow, oh, oh, oh
Come on, baby, drive me home
I don't wanna be alone
Why don't you come with me and stay for a while?
I see it in your eyes
Don't you wanna kiss goodnight
Tell me baby let me know
Don't be shy
I'll be your sweet surprise
I don't want just any guy
Come on baby hypnotize me
With your loving
I wanna kiss you through the night
Hold me tight
Come on baby so hot (so hot)
Falling to my knees, so happy so
One hundred degrees, so hot, so hot
Baby take it slow, oh, oh, oh
When I first saw you
Couldn't take my eyes off you
You're smooth and classy
You're everything I want and everything that I need
I'm falling to my knees, so hot
One hundred degrees, so hot
Baby, take it slow, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So hot (so hot)
I'm falling to my knees, so hot (so hot)
One hundred degrees
