I was lost, now I'm found
Pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up
Dust it off, carry on
When nothing seems, when nothing seems to work
You throw those sticks and stones
Can't hurt me, me anymore
You know I'm born to fight
Put the gloves on and learn to fight like a champion
Feel like a butterfly
Can't hold me down, can't hold me down
Life is a battlefield, I'll be a warrior
Can't hold me down, can't hold me down
Fight like a champion
Feels like war, but what for?
I'm above it all, I'm above it all
There's no words can explain
Oh, it feels, oh, it feels so cool
You throw those sticks and stones
Can't hurt me, me anymore
You know I'm born to fight
Put the gloves on
And learn to fight like a champion
Float like a butterfly
Can't hold me down, can't hold me down
Life is a battlefield, I'll be a warrior
Can't hold me down, can't hold me down (I'm on your chain)
I will step into the rain
I'm the undisputed queen
If you try to hold me down
I will rise above, rise above
Fight like a champion, float like a butterfly
Can't hold me down, can't hold me down
Life is a battlefield, I'll be a warrior
Can't hold me down, can't hold me down
I learned to fight like a champion, swim like a butterfly
Can't hold me down, can't hold me down
Life is a battlefield, I'll be a warrior
Can't hold me down, can't hold me down
I learned to champion
Can't hold me down, can't hold me down
I learned to champion
Can't hold me down, can't hold me down, I am the champion
