Underneath the street lights where the wild things roam
Living on the edge never calling it home
In the heartbeat of the city where the stories unfold
I'm a rebel soul breaking out of the mold
Rebel soul standing tall
Landing alive to break the fall
In the fire where we find control
We're living loud with a rebel soul
Every night's an anthem in this restless town
Chasing after dreams never backing down
In the whispers of the night where the secrets are told
I'm a rebel soul burning bright and bold
Rebel soul standing tall
Begging life to break the fall
In the fire where we find control
We're living loud with the rebel soul
Underneath the moonlight where the shadows play
Dancing with the chaos in a wild display
In the rhythm of the night where our hearts ain't cold
I'm a rebel soul, never doing what I'm told
Rebel soul standing tall
Living life to break the fall
In the fire where we find control
We're living loud with the rebel soul
As the dawn approaches and the stars fade out
In the light of morning there is no doubt
In the pages of our lives where the stories are told
I'm a rebel soul and the truth unfolds
Rebel soul standing tall
Living life to break the fall
In the fire where we find control
We're living loud with a rebel soul
In the echoes of our time
Rebel soul forever shines
Through the highs and all the lows
We're living life with a rebel soul
