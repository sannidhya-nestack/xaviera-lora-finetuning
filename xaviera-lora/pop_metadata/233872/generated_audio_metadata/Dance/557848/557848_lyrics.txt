Game on, step up on the platform
I'm waiting for ya, heavy on the dance floor
Someone tell the DJ to start this music
Makes my body switch like an analog stick
So make your move'cause I'ma put it down on the floor
Don't stop, give me more
Life bars slipping, need to catch up
Dancing with the star, star, you better level up
Oh, better level up
Oh, gotta level up
Oh, need to level up
Dancing with the star, star, you better level up
Round two, sixty seconds on the clock
And I'm going in'til the bass tells me to stop
Tonight I wanna dance'til the morning
I'm in the zone, I can't control it
So make your move if you want to
Follow my lead if it's getting too hard to keep up with me
But you gotta pay attention, watch me (3, 2, 1, go)
I'ma put it down on the floor
Don't stop, give me more
Life bars slipping, need to catch up
Dancing with a star, star, you better level up
Oh, gotta level up (level up)
Oh, gotta level up (level up)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Need to level up
Dancing with the star, star
You better level up
You know I love a challenge
Let's make this party last until dawn
Not gonna stop until I've won, won, I've won
Make your move if you want to
Follow my lead if it's getting too hard to keep up with me
But you gotta pay attention, watch me go
I'ma put it down on the floor
Don't stop, give me more
Life bars slipping, need to catch up
Dancing with a star, star, you better level up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Better level up, level up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, gotta level up, level up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, needs to level up
Dance on like a star, star, you better level up
