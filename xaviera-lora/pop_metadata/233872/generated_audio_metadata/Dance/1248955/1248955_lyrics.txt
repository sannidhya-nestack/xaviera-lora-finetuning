I saw you there across the room, in your eyes a spark aflame
You smiled and it felt like June, but outside it poured and rained
We stepped out into the storm, laughing like we were insane
No care for what's the norms, two hearts without a chain
We're dancing in the rain, lost in the sweetest pain
Nothing but love remains in every drop that breaks
Holding on to this night under the silver sky
Dancing in the rain, you and I
The streets are rivers, glittering gold
Neon lights reflect our dreams
Your touch makes me feel bold
We're more than what it seems
This moment's ours, so pure and true
A world away from all the noise
If it's just me and you
Lights, rhythm, our silent voice
We're dancing in the rain
Lost in this sweet escape
Nothing but love remains
In every drop that breaks
Holding on to this night
Until the suicide
Dancing in the rain
You and I
Oh, oh, oh, dancing in my heart
Oh, oh, oh, I'll shake my friend
Tomorrow might be miles away
But tonight let's not pretend
In your arms I wanna stay
Till the rain brings us to the end
We're painting memories so bright
Colors only we can see
In this dance we find our light
Of forever in each heartbeat
We're dancing in the rain
Lost in this sweet escape
Nothing but love remains
In every drop that breaks
Holding on to this night
Under the silver sky
Dancing in the rain
You and I
Oh, dancing in the rain
Oh, dancing in the rain
Just you and I
Oh, oh
Tomorrow might be miles away, but tonight
