Disaster, disaster
Chase after a little bit faster
You don't want to end it
Dreading water as you try to defend it
I let you go freely
Cause I want somebody to incomplete me
You say it's not fair that's true but
Smoke and mirrors on the battlefield out here
And now we're down to the wire and it's still not right
Give it up, give it up, you've tried but I don't wanna be so confined
I'm a dead end, I'm a waste of time
You don't want secrets and you don't want lies
Don't want what's on my mind
Try to put it all together but you can't yet
what is love but a moving target?
Diamond ceilings and crystal floors
All I wanted were open doors
Disaster, disaster
You held out for a happy ever after
But when it never came you were left holding out your heart
Saying I still feel the same
Don't try to resist it
A charmed life but a perilous existence
A bit of medicines and breakable ties
All live in the shifting distance
And now we're down to the wire and it's still not right
Then give it up, give it up, you've tried
But I don't wanna be so confined
I'm a dead end, I'm a waste of time
If you don't want secrets then you don't want lies
Don't want what's on my mind
Try to put it all together but you can't yet
what is love but a moving target?
(Target, target, target, target, target, target, target)
Stacks of records in constant fall
Can't regret what you can't recall
All I count on and all you'll get
Is inevitably we et
All I count on and all you'll get
Is inevitably, inevitably
And now we're down to the wire and it's still not right
Give it up, give it up, you tried but I don't wanna be so confined
I'm a dead end, I'm a waste of time
You don't want secrets and you don't want lies
Don't want what's on my mind
Try to put it all together but you can't yet
what is love but a moving target?
