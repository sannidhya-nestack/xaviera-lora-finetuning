Tonight I will dance until my feet can't feel the floor
Tonight I don't care because it's my life to control
Rock your body when the beat drops
Loose control and crank the beat up
Tonight everybody dance
Move it to the music and get loud
Have the time of your life
Reach out and feel the sound
Tonight I'm tryna break loose, time to break the chains
Just let the music lift you up like David Blaine
Feel like I'm up court on a breakaway
Clubs treat me like a star cause I make it rain
Like Lil Wayne got my shades on my face and a cup in my hand
I blow smoke like a dragon, puffin' on gear
We're takin' fire to the dome like the top of a candle
Feelin' hotter than lava, right now I don't care
So where my party people at, put your hands up
Time to hit the dance floor and take over the damn club
People put your bottles in the air if you don't care what
We just tryna party hard until we see the damn sun
Rock your body when the beat drops
Lose control and crank the beat up
Tonight everybody dance
Move it to the music and get loud
Have the time of your life
Reach out and feel the sound (reach out and feel the sound)
We own the night, bring the music to life
Reach for the sky and let the beat drop
The moment's right, just have the time of your life
Woah, because I'm losing it
The way you rock your body, drives me crazy
Feel like the world's mine, time to take it
Follow rules long enough, it's time to break'em (break'em)
The way you rock your body, drives me crazy
Feel like the world's mine, time to take it
Follow rules long enough, it's time to break'em, yeah, yeah
Tonight's the night, everybody dance
Move it to the music and get loud
Have the time of your life
Reach out and feel the sound
Tonight I will dance until my feet can't feel the floor
Tonight I don't care because it's my life to control
