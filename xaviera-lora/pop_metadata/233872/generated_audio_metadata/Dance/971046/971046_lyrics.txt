When something in this world tumbles me down
And it seems like there's no light out there
I just look at me and the mirror has its ways
Reflecting what is and I'm okay
I'm okay, and I'm okay, I'm okay, yes
When something in this world tumbles you down
And seems like there's no light or death
Just look at you, just a mirror has its ways
Reflecting what is, and you're okay
You'll be okay, you'll be okay
When the weight of the world is on your shoulder
You don't know which way to go
every road looks like a war zone
Just look at you
the mirror has its ways
It's reflecting what is
And you'll be okay
When something in this world tumbles me down
And it seems like there's no light of day
I just look at me
And the mirror has its ways
Reflecting what is
And I'm okay
I'm okay
Reflecting what is
And I'm okay
If my dream boy is
If my dream boy is
If my dream boy is
If my dream boy is
If my dream boy is
If my dream boy is
If my dream boy is
If my dream boy is
I'm a pig in skin
