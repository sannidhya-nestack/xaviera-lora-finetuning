And now I'm free, free, free
And now I'm free, free, free
This time you know that you took it too far
So tell me, tell me who do you think that you are?
Try again, you know, I hadn't heard that one before
Turn around, you're done, so go find yourself a door
And now I'm free to do whatever I choose
And I'm free to do it right, I got nothing to lose
Freedom cost me dear but now the path is clear
I can find my way
I'm free to do whatever I choose
And I'm free to do it right, I got nothing to lose
Freedom cost me dear, but now the path is clear
I can find my way
Freedom
Last time you said that you'd always be there
So tell me, tell me how you expect me to care
Looking back I can't believe that you tried it again
My eyes were closed but now they're open and I'm over the pain
And now I'm free to do whatever I choose
And now I'm free to do it right I got nothing to lose
Freedom cost me dear, but now the path is clear
I can find my way (my way)
Free to do whatever I choose
And I'm free to do it right, I got nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
Freedom cost me dear, but now the path is clear
I can find my way
Freedom
Free, freedom
And now I'm free
Free, free to do
And now I'm free
Free, free
And now I'm free
