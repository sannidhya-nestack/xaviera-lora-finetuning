Your room, lights dim low, hard to reach, don't you know?
Locking eyes from across, should I flirt or let it toss?
Smile's shy, but it's bold, sure brush feels like gold
Waves crash inside my chest, playing cool is my best
To flirt or not to flirt?
Mind the storm, hearts a-burst
Do I make a move or stay?
To flirt or not today
Lost in thoughts like a maze
Every step it feels a craze
One word could change the night
Will I get it right?
Simple words getting strong
Maybe right or maybe wrong
But my heart won't stand still
Come up going for the floor
To flirt or not to flirt (not to flirt)
Mind the storm, hearts a burst (hearts a burst)
Do I make a move or stay
Too afraid or not today
The smile's shy but it's bold
Shoulder brush feels like gold
Shoulder brush feels like gold
Smile's shy but it's bold
Shoulder brush feels like gold
Waves crash inside my chest
Playing cool is my best
To flirt or not to flirt (not to flirt)
Mindstorm hard to burst (hard to burst)
Do I make a move or stay (move or stay)
To flirt or not today (to flirt or not today)
Too afraid or not today
Lost in thoughts like a maze
Mind is told how it works
Do I wait or will I stay
Too afraid or not today
