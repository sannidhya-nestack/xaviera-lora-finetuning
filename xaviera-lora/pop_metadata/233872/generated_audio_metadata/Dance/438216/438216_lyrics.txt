One thing is certain I think I know
I saw a blessing in your disguise
Secrets you hide behind your open eyes
Will show me the way to your heart tonight
We engage, we inspire
We will light a candle between two fires
We are one, we are wise
At the last we will be, I can see in your eyes
Give and take, get some satisfaction
Don't hesitate, you just gotta see that there's no time to waste
When all is said and done, communicate
I really wanna know, give and take
Don't hesitate
There's no time to waste
Communicate, I really wanna know
Nearer to you is where I will be
Being beside you is said and done
Everything's perfect, I've waited so long
It goes without saying, we will be strong
We engage, we inspire
We will light a candle between two fires
We are one
We are wise
At the last we will be
I can see in your eyes
Give and take
Get some satisfaction
Don't hesitate
You just gotta see that there's no time to waste
When all is said and done
Communicate
I really wanna know
Give and take
Don't hesitate (hesitate)
There's no time to waste
Communicate, I really wanna know
Give and take, get some satisfaction
Don't hesitate, you just gotta see that there's no time to waste
When all is said and done, communicate
I really wanna know
Give and take, don't hesitate
There's no time to waste (I'm trying to see)
Communicate (I really wanna know)
Give and take (Give and take)
Don't hesitate (hesitate)
There's no time to waste (No time to waste)
Communicate (Give and take)
Give and take, oh
