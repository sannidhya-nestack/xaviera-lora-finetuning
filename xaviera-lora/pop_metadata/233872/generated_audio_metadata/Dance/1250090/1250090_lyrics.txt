Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sunrise in my eye, empty road ahead
Feel the thrill to ride, no plans, no bed
City lights behind, speed across the trees
Music loud and wide, open road so free
Come drive my car tonight
Feel the wind, feel the light
Take the wheel and hold on tight
Drive my car'til morning bright
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Echoes in the night, laughing voices now
Under stormy skies, miles from the crowd
Leave your worries for, silence fills the air
Just you me and my car, nothing else can compare
Come drive my car tonight
Feel the wind, feel the light
Take the wheel and hold on tight
Drive my car'til morning bright
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Come drive my car tonight
Feel the wind, feel the light
Take the wheel and hold on tight
Drive my car'til morning bright
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
