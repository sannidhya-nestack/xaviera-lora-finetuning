There are no phrases
And in our words there are no codes
And enough music and beautiful notes
To explain how I'm feeling about
You wouldn't want the whole letter you owe
But I've got your most hopeful
Bringing us to the place where we have been so long ago
We have been strung in harm
I swear I know that it goes already quite long (quite long, quite long, quite long)
I swear I will never betray your hope (your hope, your hope)
Just give me one chance, just tell me three words
Just let me know that there is still love
There is still love, there is still love, there is still love between both of us
There are no phrases, and no numbers
To fix what is broken and
To mend what is gone
To mend what is gone
Maybe there is no way of going back
I wish I let the child I cope of
But I'm catching this hope of
Bringing us to the place where we have been so long ago
Where we have been so long
I swear I'm not bad at golf, already quite long (quite long, quite long, quite long)
I swear I won't ever betray your hope (your hope, your hope)
Just give me one chance, just tell me three words
Just let me know that there is still love
There is still love, there is still love, there is still love between both of us
I swear I'm not bad, I go already quite long (quite long, quite long, quite long)
I swear I will never betray your hope (your hope, your hope)
Just give me one chance, just tell me three words
Just let me know that there is still love
There is still love, there is still love, there is still love between both of us
