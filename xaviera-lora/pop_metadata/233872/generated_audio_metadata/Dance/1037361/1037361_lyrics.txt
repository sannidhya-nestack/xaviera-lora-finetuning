Why did you tap like
I'm the father of this fat girl, fat girl
I need you by my side
But you better text her
Don't talk to me, I'm a resentful bitch
Don't flip my tape
You aren't even worth it
You aren't even worth it
To look at me
To look at me
I mean good to you, never touch it
Go home and start loving yourself
Go home and start loving yourself
I've been good to you, never touch it
Go home and start loving yourself
Don't look at me, don't look at me
Don't talk to me, I'm a resentful bitch
Don't flip my tape, you aren't even worth it
You aren't even worth it
To look at me
To look at me
I mean good to you, never touch it
Go home and start loving yourself
Go home and start loving yourself
