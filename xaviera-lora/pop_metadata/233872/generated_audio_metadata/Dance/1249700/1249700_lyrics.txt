Every time we meet again, like a new beginning
Eyes that shine so bright, makes me feel so alive
Heartbeat starts to race, every smile you chase
In the moment lost, what a perfect call
Feels like the first time, every time you're mine
Like a spark ignites inside
Every look can't hide
Moments freeze in air when you're standing there
Touch is electric makes life so empty
Feels like the first time, every time you're mine
Like a spark ignites inside, every love can't hide
Moments freeze in air
When you're standing there
Touch is electric
Makes life so hectic
Feels like the first time
Every time you're mine
Like a spark ignites inside
Every low can't hide
As they interlace in a time and space
With your misplace, love's a lovely trace
Hands they interlace
In a timeless space
With you in this place
Love's a lovely trace
Feels like the first time
Every time you're mine
You're mine
Like a spark ignites inside
Every look can't hide
Can't hide
Feels like the first time
Every time you're mine
Time you're mine, mine
Like a spark ignites inside
Every look can't hide
Every look can't hide
