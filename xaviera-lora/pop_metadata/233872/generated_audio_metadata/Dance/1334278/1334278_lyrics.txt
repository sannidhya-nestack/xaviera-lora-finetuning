Oh no
You showed up like a flash of gold
Right when the world was feeling cold
One look and my doubts let go
Now I'm burning from the inside
We're laughing loud like we own the sky
Hands in the air we're flying high
You and me we don't need a plan
Just a beat and a second chance
We got the stars in our corner
Running fast, getting warmer
Every touch, every word
Feels louder than ever
We go all night, all in
Hearts wide open, no end
Feels like we're finally living
Yeah, we're born to break and bend
We got no brakes, just fire
Fueling every desire
If this is love, we're winning
We go wild
All night, all day
Every move a spark we strike
Spinning under the city lights
No past, no rules to fight
Just the rhythm in your hand and mine
Pulled close by the gravity
Of a moment that was meant to be
This isn't luck, it's chemistry
We're storming, we're finally free
We got the stars in our corner
Running fast, getting warmer
Every touch, every word
Feels louder than I've ever heard
We go all night
All in, hearts wide open, no end
Feels like we're finally living
Yeah, we're born to break and bend
We got no breaks, just fire
Fueling every desire
If this is love, we're winning
We go all night, all in
No rewind, no pause, just go
We're the spark that stole the show
Right here, right now, we know
We're the ones that'll never slow
We go all night, all in
Hearts wide open, no end
Feels like we're finally living
Yeah, we're born to break and bend
We got no breaks, just fire
Fueling every desire
If this is love, we're winning
All night, all in
All night, all in
All night, all in
We go all night, all in
