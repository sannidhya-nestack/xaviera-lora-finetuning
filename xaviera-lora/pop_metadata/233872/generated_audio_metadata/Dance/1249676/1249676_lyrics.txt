Need a break from the chase
Heart is feeling tight
Gotta breathe and find my space
Baby give me back my life
Running, running out of steam
Pressure every night
This is when I need a dream
Baby I deserve to fly
I've done this for me, buddy, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Got this down, I'll be, I'll be on
Yeah, I'm the, I'm the heartbeat, I'm the young
Do it all, do it all, do it all
Yeah, I'm the, I'm the heartbeat
I'm the young
Need a break from the chase, show you feel tight
There's a bench to be, clean all the things, now I just need a light
Need a break from the chase, heart is feeling tight
Gotta breathe and find my space, baby give me back my light
Running, running out of steam, pressure every night
This is when I need a dream, baby I deserve to fly
I'm done slipping to find you
I've got left out, I've already found you
Know the light is on the skies, love my baby face
Can't be pronounced, your ins and outs, your body's great
Throw some ice, baby, when you throw some ice, baby, when you shoot a light
I just don't ever argue
In my life I get baby beat, I deserve to fly
Sometimes I just need a place
Where I can be free
A moment to et
Just to be me
The city lights are blinding but I
Close my eyes
Hoping for a place where time flies
Need a break
From the chase, heart is feeling tight
