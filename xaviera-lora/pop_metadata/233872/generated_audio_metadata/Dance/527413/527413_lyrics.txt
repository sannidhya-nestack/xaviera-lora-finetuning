One hundred and eighty days
Feels like forever since we've had our last embrace
You left an empty space
I'm sleeping in your shirt so I will not et your face
No last goodbye, no time to cry and pray
Just another night I wish you'd stayed
No arms to hide, no reasons why you changed
Just another hour to feel this pain
And I am going crazy
Cannot handle who I am
Oh, I am going crazy
I'm missing you like hell
Our love was paramount
But like the king and queen were crowned
Our love was paramount
We would break the speed of sound
Our love was paramount
We would dance around and round and round and round
Our love was paramount
Now I feel I'm drifting out of bounds
One hundred and eighty nights
I'm still wondering who was wrong and who was right that night
Thorn in my side
It reminds me how I miss your tender kiss goodnight
And I am going crazy
Can I handle who I am
Oh I am going crazy
Cause I'm missing you like hell
Our love was paramount
Felt like the king and queen were crowned
Our love was paramount
We would break the speed of sound
Our love was paramount
We would dance around and round and round and round
Our love was paramount
Now I feel I'm drifting out of bounds
Lonely days and lonely nights
Feels like a soul survivor whose soul just died
Lonely days and lonely nights
My heart can't seem to find a place to hide
Our love was paramount
We would dance around and round and round and round
Our love was paramount
We would break the speed of sound
Our love was paramount
We would dance around and round and round and round
Our love was paramount
Now I feel I'm drifting out of bound
