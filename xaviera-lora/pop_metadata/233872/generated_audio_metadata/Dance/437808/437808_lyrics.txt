Gotta tell you, gotta tell you what you do to me
Do you know, do you know what you do to me, baby?
Gotta tell you, gotta tell you what you do to me
Life has not been the same
Shine your love on me
You just shine
Shine your love on me
I just live
To see the dawn of another day
I just live
To see the dawn of another day
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh, uh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'd like to know, like to know what you feel for me
Tell me now, tell me now, what you feel for me, baby
You just shine, shine your love on me
You just shine, shine your love on me
'Cause I just live to see the dawn of another day
I just live to see the dawn of another day
I just live to see the dawn of another day
I just live to see the dawn of another day
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, papi (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
'Cause I just live to see the dawn of another day
I just live to see the dawn of another day
I just live to see the dawn of another day
I just live to see the dawn of another day
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
