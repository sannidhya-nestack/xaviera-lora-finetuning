I could always be the one you wanna call when it's cold outside
I will always be the one that's right here standing by your side
Open up your heart and let me in
I promise not to break you
I promise I'll be all, all that you want
So let me in, in my heart before
Let me in, oh
Love explodes, our hearts implode
Your love explodes, our hearts implode
Your love explodes, our hearts implode
I could always be the one you want to call when it's cold outside
I will always be the one that's right here standing by your side
Open up your heart and let me in
I promise not to break you
I promise I'll be all, all that you want
Catch me now, I can't leave
Hold me now, I'm yours now, believe
Your love explodes, our hearts implode
Your love explodes, our hearts implode
Your love explodes, our hearts implode
Your love explodes, our hearts implode
Your love explodes, our hearts implode
Your love explodes, our hearts implode
