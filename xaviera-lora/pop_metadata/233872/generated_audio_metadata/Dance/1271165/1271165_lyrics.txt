Baby it's my fault
I could take the fall
No I don't mind at all
You know you played your part
Tell me I'm the enemy
Sure know how to get to me
You got me gamblin' my heart for clarity
You live in memories
Not what you turned out to be
I never wanted it to be like this
You'll never change
Never for me
You'll never change
Till we stay the same
You'll never change
Never for me
You'll never change
Till we stay the same
You never change
You taught me how to let go
So why do I still miss you
I'm happy but I'm all alone
Won't call you but I want to
And I wonder if you miss me at all
Watch the marks from my toes
Off the passenger window I saw
He burned all the clothes
The ones that remind you of coffee
On your way home
Tell me I'm the enemy
Showing how to get to me
You got me gambling my heart for clarity
The living memory's not what you turned out to be
I never wanted it to be like this
You'll never change
Never for me
You'll never change
Till we stay the same
You'll never change
Never for me
You'll never change
Till we stay the same
