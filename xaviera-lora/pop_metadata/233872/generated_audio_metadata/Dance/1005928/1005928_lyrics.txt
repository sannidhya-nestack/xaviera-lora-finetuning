Words can mean so much, let's save them
And use our touch, hush boy, don't make a sound
Can't hear you over the crowd
Keep it low-rad'cause you're so fine
We can't nose dive from way up high (up high)
Come let's fly, you do what you do (you do)
Everything you're feeling now is up to you (oh)
We are so used, we just can't move
All we can do is feel the groove
We are so used, we just can't move
All we can do is feel it, feel it, feel it
Groove
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Getting close to last call
Don't even know you at all
Check your heartbeat racing
It's the pulse that I'm chasing
Keep it low, Rad,'cause you're so fine
We can't nose dive from way up high
let's fly, you do what you do
Everything you're feeling now is up to you
We are so good, we just can't move
All we can do is feel the groove
We are so good, we just can't move
All we can do is feel it, feel it, feel it
Groove
I know you're trying to keep your hands to yourself
I'm catching your vibe, your vibe
Now I can't see myself leaving when nobody else
I'm catching your vibe, your vibe
Your vibe
We are so young
All we can do is feel it
Feel it grow, feel it grow
The beauty in it
The beauty in it
Ooh
