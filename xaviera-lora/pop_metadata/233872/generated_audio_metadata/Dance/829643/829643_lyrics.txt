Please, please, please, please, please, please, please
Please, please, please, please
Be on the ground
Sensation like fall
No fear to be found
A movement of people
The makers of sound
Image and energy
All future bound
Alchemist creating
A science of sound
Keeping you guessing
Feeling the stress
Feeling the pressure, release with finesse
Vader in fashion, speakers and sound
Take it away to the underground
Beauty of spirit, beauty of soul
Intimate creature, high in gold
Take me back to the beginning
Please, please, please, please
Be on the ground
Sensation like fall
No fear to be found
A movement of people
The makers of sound
Image and energy
All future bound
Alchemist creating
A science of sound
Keeping you guessing
Feeling the stress
Feeling the pressure
Release with finesse
Vader in fashion, speakers and sound
Take it away to the underground
Beauty of spirit, beauty of soul
Intimate creature, high on gold
Take me back
Leave
Leave
Leave
Leave
Be on the ground
Sensation like fog
No fear to be found
A movement of people
The makers of sound
Image and energy
All future bound
Alchemist creating
A science of sound
Keeping you guessing
Feeling the stress
Feeling the pressure
Release with finesse
Fader in fashion, speakers and sound
Take it away to the underground
Beauty of spirit, beauty of soul
Intimate creatures, high on gold
