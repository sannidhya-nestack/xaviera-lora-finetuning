I was born to be your everything
Eternally
Eternally
I was born to be your everything
I've lived a long time and I've seen the snow and the sun
Do you see my reflection in the snow and the sun?
I was born to be your everything
Eternally
Eternally
I was born to be your everything
All along, long, it was you, you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
It was you, you, ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I've lived a long time and I've seen the snow and sun
Do you see my reflection in the snow and sun?
I was born to be your everything
Eternally
Eternally
I was born to be your everything
I was born to be your everything
Eternally
Eternally
I was born to be your everything
