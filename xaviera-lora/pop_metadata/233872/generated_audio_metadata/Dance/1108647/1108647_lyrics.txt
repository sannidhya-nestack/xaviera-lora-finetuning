I know you love it, but you can't show it
I don't know the reason why you can't stay down by my side
Please don't blow it, I need to know it
My baby running to me, lying through the night
We are carefree junkies
We are carefree junkies
We are carefree junkies
We are carefree junkies
Who cares what they're sayin'
I ain't complainin'
So proud that I'm your lover
I'll shine to the top
We are carefree junkies
We are Capri Junkies
We are Capri Junkies
We are Capri Junkies
