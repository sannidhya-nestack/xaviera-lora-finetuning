See you on the dance floor
Lights are flashing so bright
Can't take my eyes off you girl
You shine in the night
Heartbeat syncs with the bass
Feel the rhythm in my veins
Every move you make
Pulls me in like a chain, uh-uh
Transfixed by your smile
Girl, you got that stun
Lost in your eyes like a dream
We're living it now, uh-uh
In this moment, just stay
Lost and you can't look away
We're electrified
Underneath the moon's glow
Hands touch, feel the spark
Connected through the dark
Time stops when we're this close
Don't wanna let you go, oh
Transfixed by your smile
Girl, you got that stuff
Lost in your eyes like a dream
We're living it now, oh
Ooh, we're living it now
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, we're living it now
Ooh, in this moment just stay
Lost and you can't look away
We're electrified
Underneath the moon's glow
Ooh, hands touch feel the spark
Connected through the dark, uh
Time stops when we're this close
Don't wanna let you go, oh, oh
Transfix while you smile
Girl, you got that style
Lost in your eyes like a dream
We're living in now, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We're living in now, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
