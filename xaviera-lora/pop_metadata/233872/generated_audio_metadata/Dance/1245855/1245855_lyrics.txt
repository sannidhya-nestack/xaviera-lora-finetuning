Neon dreams awake in the midnight hour
Cityscapes transformed by music's power
Sirens cry, beckons from urban pulse
Rhythms we cannot repulse, we're drawn in
Feel the rhythm take you higher
Let the bassline set your soul on fire
Basslines detonate with subterranean might
Melodies levitate on ethereal flight
Beings converge in ancient tribal trance
Uninhibited moves, rhythmic circumstance
Feel the rhythm take you higher
Let the baseline set your soul on fire
Nice magic fades with the impending dawn
But echo journeys, it'll feel only on and on
Soulful reverberation, our rebirth's residue
An eternal dance that makes all lives anew
