Riding down the boulevard in a vintage car
Neon signs reflecting off the guitar
White dress fluttering like a ghost
Past the moonlit motel where I haunt you most
Hazy lights, soft lips in black and white
Film reels spinning through the night
Old Hollywood but it's just us instead
Sipping whiskey dreams on a motel bed
In the moonlit motel under faded stars
Dancing through memories trapped behind bars
Old songs playing while we whisper confessions
Lost in a memory of vintage obsession
I'm on my motel, under faded stars
Dancing through memories, trapped behind bars
Old songs play while we whisper confessions
Lost in a reverie, our vintage obsession
Parting down the boulevard in a vintage car
Neon sides reflecting off the guitar
White dress fluttering like a ghost
Past the moonlit motel where I haunt you most
Cigarette smoke curls in the midnight air
Draped in the melancholy we were
Lovers in a time loop, elegant and cursed
Living for the moment, you feel better or worse
Human mortal under faded stars
Dancing through memories trapped behind bars
Old songs play while we whisper confessions
Lost in a reverie of vintage obsession
Palm trees sway as we fade into dawn
Whispers of the night soon to be gone
One last kiss where the shadows dwell
Our story ends at the moonlit motel
