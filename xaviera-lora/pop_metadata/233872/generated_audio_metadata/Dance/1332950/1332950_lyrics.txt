Please fasten your seatbelts
Observe the safety guidelines
Close your eyes
And enjoy the trip
I always wondered about the colors
The ones I don't actually see but I know that they really are there
They must be aligned to the universe
They must be aligned to something greater
To the cosmic ethos
To cosmic energy
A flash of green, a burst of sound
Gravity bends then spins around
Echoes crash in the endless flow
Time dissolves where we dared to go
You have reached your destination
The cosmic energy can't be more than some kind of chaotic planetary surge into a far greater morphosis
Of something we just won't ever be able to ever see or feel or ever understand
We have come too far
