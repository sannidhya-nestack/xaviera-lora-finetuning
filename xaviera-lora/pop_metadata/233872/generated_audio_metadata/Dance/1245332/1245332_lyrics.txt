Behind closed doors where secrets come alive
In the flicker of the candlelight we thrive
Whispers of forever tangled in the sheets
In this hidden world our hearts find their beats
Love it hurt and is drawn we leave the world behind
Lost in each other in a dream we find
Every kiss a promise
Every touch a sign
Behind these closed doors
We reach for the sky
Closed doors where a laugh unfolds
In the quiet bones where the truth is found
Dancing in the shadows locked in mystery
Closed doors are
Heartbeat symphony
Silhouettes in moonlight
Bodies intertwined
In the stillness of the night
Our souls align
Golden whispers they are
Soft as summer rain
In this hidden haven
Freed from all the pain
Velvet curtains strongly leave the world behind
Lost in each other, a dream we find
Every kiss a promise, every touch a sign
Behind these closed doors, we reach for the sky
Close doors where our love unfolds
In the quiet moments where the truth is told
Dancing in the shadows wrapped in mystery
Close doors are our private symphony
In the heart of darkness we find our light
In the silence we're together holding tight
Every stolen moment every whispered word
In this secret world our love is heard
Filled with curtains, strongly leave the world behind
Lost in each other, in a dream we find
Every kiss a promise, every touch a sigh
Behind these closed doors, we reach for the sky
Closed doors where our love unfolds
In the quiet moments where the truth is told
Dancing in the shadows wrapped in mystery
Close doors are part of symphony
Behind closed doors where we can just be
In this hidden realm it's only you and me
In the world outside we may play our parts
But behind closed doors we reveal our hearts
