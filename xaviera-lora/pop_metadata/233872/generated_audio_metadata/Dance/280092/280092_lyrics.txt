(Ease yourself back into consciousness)
(Anybody falling? Anybody feel they're falling?)
Let's hear more from the style of it
(Paris, New York)
(Baby)
Mmm, mmm, baby
Let's hear more
Mmm, mmm, ooh, ooh
Doing it the way you wanna work it tight, keep it right
Doing it the way you wanna work it tight, keep it right
Doing it, doing it
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Anybody falling? Anybody feel that falling?
Your hips, your lips, those eyes, those thighs, legs, toes, fingers
Work it, work it, you gotta work your body, go girl
Hey hey hey
Hey!
Ooh, ooh
(We create a mental atmosphere)
Do it the way you wanna work it tight, keep it right
Do it the way you wanna work it tight, keep it right
Do it the way you wanna work it tight, keep it right
Yeah yeah yeah
Do it the way you wanna work it tight, keep it right
Do it the way you wanna work it tight, keep it right
Milan, London, New York
