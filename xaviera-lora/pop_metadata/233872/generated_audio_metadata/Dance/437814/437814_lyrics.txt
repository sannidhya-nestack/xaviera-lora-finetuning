Wanna get down
Take it up, take it up, take it up one time
Do you wanna get down
Take it up, take it up, take it one time
Need to get away, really far away
From all the things that make me weary
Nine to five each day, I want to jump and sway
In the fading light flies the promised night
Hot and long and so inviting
Want to feel so free, free as I can be
Cause the vibe
I don't care what goes on around us
The night rules, so good
Now the beat has found us
Need to get away, really far away
Take me dancing to the morning
I don't want to be alone
Take me dancing to the morning
I don't want to be alone
Do you wanna get up?
Do you wanna get down?
Do you wanna get up, get up, get up, get up, get down?
Do you wanna get up?
Do you wanna get down?
Do you wanna get up, get up, get up, get up, get down
There's a groovy place where the music plays
Faces of the people jumping
Won't you take me there, oh please take me there
Let's go dancing
Beat goes on and on'til the break of dawn
There's no stopping once you've started
Want to feel so free
Free as I can be
the vibes good
I don't care what goes on around us tonight
Rules so good now the beat has found us
Need to get away really far away
They be dancing to the warm air
I don't want to be alone
They be dancing
I don't want to be alone
Make me dance in
Just the more that
I don't want to be alone
Make me dance in
Just the more that
I don't want to be alone
Do you wanna get up?
Do you wanna get down?
Do you wanna get up, get up, get up, get up, get down
Do you wanna get up, do you wanna get down
Do you wanna get up, get up, get up, get up, get down
