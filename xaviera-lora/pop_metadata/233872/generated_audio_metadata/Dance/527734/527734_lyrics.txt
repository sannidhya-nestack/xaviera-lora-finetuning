Objectivity (objectivity)
It wears me down
Don't you have your own point of view?
Need personality (personality)
Someone who's excited to try something new
State your POV (POV, POV)
Let me know I'm missing the point of view
You see, one picture says more than a thousand words
Haven't you heard?
I want your POV
Tell me, do you like what you see?
I need your POV
Am I as bad as can be?
I want your POV
Get some guilty in the first green
I need your POV
Does your ass belong to me?
Do you, do you, do you, do you like this?
Do you like that?
Tell me baby, ooh
I want your POV
Teasing you like this, playing you like that
Tell me baby, who's the daddy of your point of view?
Caught in my act
Meet me in another world where you want to be
I'm back in black, black, black
Baby it's so easy
To get you down on your knees
You see
