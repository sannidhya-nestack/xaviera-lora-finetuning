Tonight, the stars are bright
Tonight, a ray of light goes out to you
My love, my friend, a romance that will never end
And I
Devote myself, tonight I will
I must rebel, the center of the universe
It's sad that you and I immerse
The focus is on you
I see, I feel you
I touch you when we're near again
You hear, you feel too
You touch me and we're here again
Tonight, the stars are bright tonight
A ray of light goes out to you, my love, my friend
A romance that will never end
And I devote myself tonight
I will, I must prevail
The center of the universe
It's there that you and I emerge
The focus is on you
(Ahhh)
Tonight the stars are bright, tonight a ray of light goes on to you my love, my friend
A romance that will never end
And I devote myself tonight
I will, I must prevail
The center of the universe
Is there that you and I invert
The focus is on you
