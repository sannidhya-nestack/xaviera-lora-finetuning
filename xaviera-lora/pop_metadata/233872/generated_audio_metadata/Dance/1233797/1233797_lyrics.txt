Coming alive again
Travelling through time again
I was lost for so long
And I found something new
I am breaking through
Fractals inside my eyes
I am breaking through
I am breaking through
Everything synchronized
Feeling the tides again
Basking in light again
I was afraid for so long
And I found something new
I am breaking through
Fractals inside my eyes
I am breaking through
I am breaking through
Everything's synchronized
I put my head back, close my eyes
I am floating through different dimensions
The colors exploding
Lay my head back, close my eyes, I am floating through different dimensions, the colors exploding
Lay my head back, close my eyes, I'm floating through different dimensions, the colors exploding
And I found something new
That I could hold on to
And I found something new
I am breaking through
Factors inside my eyes
I am breaking through
I am breaking through
I am breaking through
I am breaking through
