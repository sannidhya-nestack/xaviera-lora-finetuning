So it seems, my life's a circus
Feels like the butterfly effect in 3D
Even when I sleep, my bed's a skirmish
I'm hard to handle if I'm counting my sheep
Then Monday I saw you at the mall, my phone had dropped
You smiled at me and said you would call, my heart did stop
You said my eyes did sing their own song and they belonged
To a pretty girl for who you sure would fall
You make me feel I'm grace under fire (oh oh oh oh oh)
Just as everything turns wrong
You make me feel strong
Grace under fire (oh oh oh oh oh)
In the heat of my fight
You still stand by my side
I might think you're crazy
I know you're crazy about me baby
I feel grace under fire (oh oh oh oh oh)
'Cause I'm the bird on your wire
I'm still a freak, but you seem to like it
You said that I divine your gravity
Head over feet, and I'm drowning
Although I think that your perception is geek
Now I can't sleep'cause you're in my bed, no sheep instead
And your arms are under my head, nothing's unsaid
You think my eyes still sing their own song, and they belong
Too pretty cold for who you took the fall for
You make me feel I'm great under fire (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Just as everything turns wrong, you make me feel strong
Great under fire (oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
In the heat of my fight, you still stand by my side
I might think you're crazy, I know you're crazy about me, baby
I feel great under fire (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause I'm the bird on your wire
My heart is pounding each time you surround me and touch the moon
It's still astounding how you have found me I just stop and stare
You make me feel I'm great under fire (yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (yeah-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh (whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa
I might think you're crazy
Crazy about me, baby
In the heat of the fight
You still stand by my side
Grace on the lighter, yeah, yeah
Grace on the lighter, yeah, yeah
