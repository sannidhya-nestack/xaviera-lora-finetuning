Starlight shining bright on me
Wishing for your touch tonight
Warm glow in the midnight blue
Silent whispers in the dark
Guiding me to where you are
Moonbeams lighting up my heart
Wishing upon a star, that's you
Every night and every day
Hoping for a dream come true
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Marvel at your distant light
You brighten up my darkest night
Keeping all my fears away
My dreams beyond the sky so high
Close my eyes and there you are
Together we will fly away, away, away
We're just a warm star, that's you
Every night and every day
Hoping for a dream come true
We should look for a star that's you
Every night and every day
Hoping for a dream come true
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
