What do your thoughts look like?
Behind your eyes when you dream tonight
Life can be heavy sometimes
Could I take you far from your mind?
Where would you like to go?
There's a midnight cafe down the road
Maybe you just wanna get lost with me
I'd like to know
I'd like to know
I'd like to know
If you wanna get lost with me
Life can be ours tonight or for the rest of our lives
Life can be ours tonight
We don't have to decide
Just trying to find a simple kind of paradise
I'd like to know, I'd like to know
I'd like to know, I'd like to know
et ourselves in the rain
Take a love story and write it again
Take it all the way to the sunrise
Just give me a simple paradise
Where would you like to go?
I know a skylight we can lay below
Maybe you just wanna get lost with me
I'd like to know
I'd like to know
I'd like to know
If you wanna get lost with me
Life can be ours tonight or for the rest of our lives
Life can be ours tonight
We don't have to decide
Just trying to find
Simple kind of paradise
Life can be our worst tonight or for the rest of our lives
Life can be our worst tonight
We don't have to decide
Just trying to find a simple kind of paradise
