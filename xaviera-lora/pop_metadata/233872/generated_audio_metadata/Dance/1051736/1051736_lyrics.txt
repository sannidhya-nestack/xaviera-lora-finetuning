Who sent me this? Oh my, it's found a place in my heart
I can't resist all this sweet like a strawberry tart
I'm literally fainting, I find it hard just to wait
Oh la la, les amis, les bonbons avec mon mureté
Share the precious moments of your life
I promise you that it could be so nice
Sometimes you have to enjoy the surprise
Tu tu tu, tic-tac and bonbon
Tu tu tu, tic-tac and Bonbon
Tu tu tu, tic-tac and Bonbon
Tu tu tu, tic-tac andBonbon
I know that this is a sign
I'm trying to keep my voice
No flowers, candy
So I'm sticking with what I enjoy
I'm literally fanning
Do it all over again
Oh la la, les amis, les bonbons
C'est le trend
Share the precious moments of your life
I promise you that it could be so nice
Sometimes you have to endure the sweet surprise
Tu tu tu, tic tac and bon bon
Tu tu tu, tic tac and bon bon
Tu tu tu, tic tac and bon bon
Tu tu tu, tic tac and bon bon
Don't you really like
Say don't you really like boy
Don't you really like
Say don't you really like boys (don't you really like)
Say don't you really like boys (don't you really like)
Say don't you really
Share the precious moments of your life
Promise you that it could be so nice
Sometimes you have to endure this surprise
Tu tu tu, tic tac and bon bon (don't you really like)
Tu tu tu, tic tac and bon bon
(don't you really like)
Tu tu tu, tic tac and bon bon
(don't you really like)
Tu tu tu, tic tac and bon bon
Don't you really like?
