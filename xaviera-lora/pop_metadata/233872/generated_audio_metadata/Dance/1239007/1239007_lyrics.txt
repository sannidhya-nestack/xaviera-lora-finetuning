On a sunny day, we packed our bags and went away
To a land so far, a paradise where we could play
From the moment I stepped foot on the golden sand
I knew this vacation was about to be grand
Ooh yeah
Through the crowded streets
I saw your smiling face
Feeling like a dream
A love we couldn't erase
Our eyes met
And our hearts started to race
In that magical moment
Time and space erased
Ooh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh summer love
You got me spinning round and round
Dancing on the beach
Oh with the waves as I sound
Underneath the stars
We found our melody
The indianian spirits
Love's a harmony oh yeah
Oh, summer love, you got me spinning round and round
Dancing on the beach, oh-oh-oh-oh
With the waves as I sound underneath the stars
We found our melody
The Indianese lyrics
Love's a harmony, oh yeah
