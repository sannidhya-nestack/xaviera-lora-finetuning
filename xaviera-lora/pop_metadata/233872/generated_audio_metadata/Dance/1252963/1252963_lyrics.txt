Breathing in the mountain air
Feel the wind, it lifts my hair
Rivers flowing wild and free
Nature's song it sings to me
Every step I feel the ground
It goes of the world around
In the present I am found
High on life, I'm unbound
High on life, no need for more
Open skies and open doors
Every moment I explore
High on life I soar
Sunrise paints the sky in gold
Stories of the earth unfold
Whispers in the rustling trees
Every breath a sweet release
Every step I feel the ground
Echoes of the world around
In the present I am found
High on life I'm unbound
High on life no need for more
Open skies and open doors
Every moment I explore
High on life I soar
Through the valleys, over peaks
In the silence, hear it speak
In this journey, I believe
High on life, I achieve
High on life, no need for more
Open skies and open doors
Every moment I explore
High on life, I soar
Every heartbeat, every stride
In this feeling, I can fly
High on life, I'll always ride
In this bliss, I reside
