(A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a -a)
Now you're standing close to me
I feel your body shiver
It's not that I can't set you free
Don't wanna cry a river
I see you standing in the rain
Without you I go insane
I feel your touch, I want you near
Without you I have no fear
Without you I have no fear
(It's all in my head)
Now you're standing close to me
I feel your body shiver
It's now that I can set you free
Don't wanna cry a river
I see you standing in the rain
Without you I go insane
I feel your touch, I want you near
Without you I have no fear
Without you I have no fear
Now you're standing close to me
I feel your body shiver
It's not that I can't set you free
Don't wanna cry a river
I see you standing in the rain
Without you I go insane
I feel your touch, I want you near
Without you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
