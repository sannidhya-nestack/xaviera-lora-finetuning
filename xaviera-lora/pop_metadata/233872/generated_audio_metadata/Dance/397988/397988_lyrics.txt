Touch, touch me baby
Hold, hold me baby
Close, take me in your arms
Feel, feel me baby
Love, love me baby
Still, I can't get enough
In this great big world it seems so frightening
Everything just seems so dark
Hoping for a better life where people are together
Take me in your arms and hold me tight
I need you close by my side
Baby let me feel your love tonight
We get together, our souls unite
Get together, get together, let our souls unite
Hold me baby, let me disappear into your arms tonight
Feel, feel me baby
Love, love me baby
Still, I can't get enough
In this great big world I need you by my side
I need your love to feel alright
Take me in your arms and hold me tight
Oh I need you close by my side
Baby let me feel your love tonight
We get together our souls unite
Get together get together
Let our souls unite
Hold me baby, let me disappear into your arms tonight
Feel, feel me baby
Love, love me baby
Still, I can't get enough
Take me in your arms and hold me tight
Oh, I need you close by my side
Baby, let me feel your love tonight
We'll get together, our souls unite tonight
Tonight
Tonight
