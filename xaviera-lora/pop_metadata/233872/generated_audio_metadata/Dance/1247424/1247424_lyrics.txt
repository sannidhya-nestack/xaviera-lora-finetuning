Underneath our lights we fly high
Future dreams waste in our eyes
Every corner feels alive now
Electric hearts they beat inside
Digital love across the sky
You are name we never die
In this world of spark and shine
With you I feel so divine
You fit me into my life
Every moment new and bright
We dance in fields of starry light
You fit me into my life
You said we need this in my life
Every moment you let me lie
You can't say it feels so strong in love
Heroes they lead into the night of light
Through the shadows, through the fire
Together we rise higher
Pixels paint our endless night
Lost in love it feels so right
Rhythmic pulses in the air
We are free without a care
Holding hands in this dreamscape
Every kiss another escape
You fit me into my life
Every moment new and bright
We dance in fields of starry light
You fit me into my life
You fit me in my life
Every moment of every round
Just a glimpse of my life
