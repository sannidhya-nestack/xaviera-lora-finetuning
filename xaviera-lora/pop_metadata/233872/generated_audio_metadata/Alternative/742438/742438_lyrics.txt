Say a prayer for mankind
I believe we've lost our minds
Say a prayer for mankind
I believe we've lost our minds, yeah
We need something to believe in
Protect us from ourselves
Something to believe in
What are we really fighting for?
Send our children off to war
Fuel to drive our SUVs
Stimulate economies
Camouflage your cars
So hold on, you're taking us for a ride
With propaganda hype, but you're lost
I've seen it all before
Two minute open door
Your wife responders a joke
I'll take another talk to prove
Oh point that sweet to me
My luxury's your disease
As far as I can see
First time I've said no much for me
Say a prayer for mankind
I believe we've lost
