Being with you betrays my soul
If I walk away will you care?
Loved holster
So just be in the light
I look one way or the other now
I wish we could have had hope
Maybe I'm not that good
Maybe we could have it all
Maybe we still do
Unless we could have it all
Maybe we stand as we can, oh
Maybe we stand
I wish we could have had it all
Maybe we still did
