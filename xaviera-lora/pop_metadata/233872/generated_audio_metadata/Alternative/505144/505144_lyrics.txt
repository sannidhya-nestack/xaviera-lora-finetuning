Is it out of focus? Am I on the ground?
In and out of focus'cause I want to go down
Try not to let go, not to make a sound
Can't seem to hold it, even if you slow down
And you feel like you're falling down
But it's all in your head
Is it out of focus, am I on the ground?
Getting out of focus'cause I want it to go down
Try not to let go, not to make a sound
Can't seem to hold it even if we slow down (even if we slow down)
And you feel like you're falling down
But it's all in your head
And you feel like you're falling down
But it's all in your head
And you feel like you've fallen down
But it's all in your head
Can't get much closer to you
Telephone lines are in tune
Can't help but bailing out
Can't help but bailing out
Can't get much closer to you
Telephone lines are in tune
I can't help but bail it out
Can't help but bail it out
I can't get much closer to you
Telling old lies aren't true
Can't help but bail it out
Can't help but bail it out
