I've been crying every day
Friends keep asking, are you okay?
My body trembles, my heart's in flames
Don't always know why my eyes pour in
I'm a wandering ghost
And I long to go back home
I'm a wandering ghost and I long to go back home
I'm replaying our goodbye
Subway stations whispered always mine
Jumped on a plane couldn't recognize
No more crammed beds or giddy sighs
Now I know you're gone
So I must move on
Now I know you're gone
So I must move on
Now we're just shells of what we used to be
Home's just a concept, not relevant to me
Romance and ideal, all one day redeem
I'm a temple, wiping myself clean
Heavy baggage, heavy heart
At least I can unload by making art
I miss the end, the middle, the restless start
I miss every part, I don't like this part
But the more I cry
The more I feel alive
The more I cry
The more I feel alive
The more I cry
The more I feel alive
The more I cry
The more I know that I'm alive
