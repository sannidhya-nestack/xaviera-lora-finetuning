I'd like to be hanging from your wall
Like this paper I stuck in a branch wall hall
Sometimes I like to think that I'm alone
Staring at this paintbrush
Lines come and go like day for rain
Think I'll sit here and complain
Don't turn your back on, goodbye my silhouette
Cartoon woman, don't stare
Don't turn your back on, goodbye my silhouette
Goodbye my silhouette
Keep your watches handy
The yellow pages of her youth gone by
Time will take your breath away
But I still remember
Lips again a yellow coat of hair
When I blink she isn't there
Cartoon woman, don't stare, don't turn your back on, goodbye my silhouette
Cartoon woman, don't stare, don't turn your back on, goodbye my silhouette
Goodbye my silhouette, bye bye
Cartoon woman
Cartoon woman
Cartoon woman don't stare
Don't turn your back on
Goodbye my silhouette
Cartoon woman don't stare
Don't turn your back on
Goodbye my silhouette
