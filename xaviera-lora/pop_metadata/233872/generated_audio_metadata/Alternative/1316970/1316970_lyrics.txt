Searching for light in the echo of dreams
Fading like whispers, oh so it seems
Caught in a loop, in this night we roam
Holding on to shadows always feels like home
Love in fragments, hearts played the part
Dancing on edges, you work a lot
We're adding a dye
A moment in time
Forever our fight
Chemical spark in the depths of our hearts
We light up the dark
Waves of nostalgia wash over my soul
Every memory whispers making me whole
Trapped in the colours that swirl in my mind
Fleeting connections, so never unkind
Searching for answers, no spaces between
You're the illusion, lives in my dreams
But rather than die, I'm only the type that drives me mad
Forever I'll fight
Can I glow a spark in the depths of our hearts?
We light up the dark
Lost in music, we find our own way
Together forever, come what may
But I'd rather die than lose what we had
A moment in time, yeah, it drives me mad
Forever I'll fight, can I go off the spark?
In the depths of our hearts, we light up the dark
