Caught up in this spinning ride, your face is painted in my mind
Every word you speak's a spark, a wildfire raging in the dark
Heartbeat races every time
Your glance feels like a perfect rhyme
Every smile's a secret code
Sink your bite, I crave the cold
Your laugh's the song I hum all day
Pulls me closer, drifts away
Every moment feels surreal
You touch the only thing that's real
(Sounds)
I can't escape this sweet unrest
Your name is ringing in my head
I'm lost in dreams, I can't let go
I'm longing for your magic flow
Your magic flow
Time stands still when you're around
But I'm too scared to make a sound
Puzzle I can't solve alone
You're the key to the unknown
I can't escape this sweet unrest
Your name's ringing in my head
I'm lost in dreams I can't let go
I'm longing for your magic flow
Your magic flow
