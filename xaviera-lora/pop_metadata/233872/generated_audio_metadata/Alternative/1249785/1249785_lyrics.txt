Round and round we go
Heart's been aching slow
Upside down love flows
Never ending show
Sky turns into ground
Lost but then we're found
Every kiss profound
Love without a sound
Upside down
Love all blown
Can't control
Hearts unknown
Eyes meet in the night
Locked in love's own fight
Flames ignite so bright
Darkness meets the light
Oh, turn the world around
Lost but now found
Love lifts off the ground
In this magic bound
Upside down
Love full blown
Can't control
Hearts unknown
Eyes of evening and night
Locked in love's own fight
Flames ignite so bright
Darkness meets the light
Turn the world around
Lost but now we're found
Love lives off the ground
In this magic bound
Upside down
Love for blood
Can't control
Hearts on the run
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
