Now we gotta go, now we gotta go
Full speed ahead, great defector
Set for the true unknown
Where is our way in?
You can't hold me back, I cannot be restrained
This one just skipped town
I'm never coming back, never coming back here
So long now, engine blast shines
Lift and engage
Living it, living it live
There is no stopping, there are no setbacks
Check one, check two, check all control
Spectacular, spectacular, spectacular, spectacular
Can't kiss this world goodbye
Spectacular, spectacular, spectacular, spectacular
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Far from moving slow, far from moving slow
Been yearning for this forever
Not wanting monotone
Where do we begin?
We'll be keeping track, all our senses sustained
We'll get there somehow
I'm never coming back, never coming back here
It's time now, engine blast shines
Lift and engage
Living it, living it live
There is no stopping, there are no setbacks
Check one, check two, check all controls
Spectacular (spectacular)
Spectacular (spectacular)
I guess this will go goodbye
Spectacular (spectacular)
Spectacular (spectacular)
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Mo-wee-oo, mo-wee-oo
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh-wee-ooh
Ooh-wee-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Now we gotta go
Now we gotta go
Now we gotta go
Now we gotta go
Now we gotta go
Now we gotta go
Engine blast, eyes lift and engage
Living it, living it, oh
There is no stopping, there are no setbacks
Track one, track two, track all controls
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
All clear, sit tight
Spectacular (spectacular)
Spectacular (spectacular)
Can't give this world goodbye
Spectacular (spectacular)
Spectacular (spectacular)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
