I don't believe in the president
I don't believe in government
I don't believe in superstars
I don't know who they are
I don't believe in magazines
I don't believe in the latest scenes
I don't believe in what I read
It's not up to them to tell me how I should be
But I believe in love
Oh I, I, I, I believe in love
I don't believe in the industry
I don't believe in the right for me
I don't believe in what they say
Not up to them to tell me what I should be
But I believe in love, yeah
Oh I, I, I, I believe in love
Can't you see there are no answers
What good would that do anyway
Everyone I know is crazy
Can't you see we lost our way
I don't believe in monopoly
I don't believe in lottery
I don't believe in stupid games
To me it seems so insane
But I believe in love
Oh I, I, I, I
Believe in love, yeah
Mmm, I
Believe in love
Well I, I, I, I'm leaving love, love, love
