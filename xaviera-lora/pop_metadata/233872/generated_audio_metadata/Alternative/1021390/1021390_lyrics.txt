There's something creeping in the air
Salt in the rivers, beware
If only you would move
Not talking, be talked to
You know what I'm saying to you
And the windows go rat-to-rat-to
Rat-too, rat-too, rat-too, rat-too
The windows go rat-too, rat-too, rat-too, rat-too
Rat-too
Strange sounds are around
Look around they don't notice
Secret sounds all around
Lost and found try and notice
Do you know this?
You'll feel the tremors in your hair
Nail down your furniture, prepare
Just like a changing dude
Like sun gives way to moon
You'll have to soon embrace your doom
And the windows go rat-a-rat-doo
Rat-too, rat-too, rat-too, rat-too
See the windows go rat-too, rat-too, rat-too, rat-too, rat-too
Strange sounds in the ground, popping'round, do you notice? (Why don't they notice?)
Spooky sounds come around near the town, don't you notice? You should notice
And the windows go rat-to-rat-to
Rat-to-rat-to
Rat-to-rat-to
The windows go rat-to-rat-to
Rat-to-rat-to
Rat-to
Strange sounds are around
Look around, they don't notice
Secret sounds all around
Lost and found, try and notice
Do you notice?
Strange sounds in the ground, pop and pound, do you notice?
Spooky sounds come around, mute a town, don't you know this?
You should notice
