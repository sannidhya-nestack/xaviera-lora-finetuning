As the season slowly ends
You put away your heart so it won't run again
it's been choosing all your friends
Sucking out the life of you while you pretend
You don't wanna lose control
'Cause you're not human like we know
Everything kept in its place
And all the matter in you will find its way out into space
Spark will fly away from you
Spark will fly away from you
Spark will fly away from you
Spark will fly away from you
Pacify your senses
If you insist on living like this
Pacify your senses
If you insist on living like
This is what you've become
Stone cold ass machine
Thought the harder you became
The tougher you'd be to break
Spark will fly away from you
Spark will fly away from you
Spark will fly away from you
Spark will fly away from you
Spark will fly with you
Spark will fly away from you
Spark will fly away from you
Spark will fly away from you
