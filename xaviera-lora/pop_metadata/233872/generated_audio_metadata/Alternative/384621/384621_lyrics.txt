On our backs, the sky is blue
And there's nothing like the smell of you
There's no one around
Not a thing to do and there's nothing like the taste of you
We're floating, we're flying naked and weightless
We're laughing, we're crying
Naked and weightless
We're needy, so greedy
Naked and weightless
And I'll dream of you
Though we don't have to there's nothing like the sound of you
So take my hand and I'll follow you
Cause there's nothing just like walking back with you
We're floating, we're flying naked and weightless
We're needy, so greedy naked and weightless
We're laughing, we're crying naked and weightless
We're floating, we're flying
Naked and weightless
And I'll dream of you
