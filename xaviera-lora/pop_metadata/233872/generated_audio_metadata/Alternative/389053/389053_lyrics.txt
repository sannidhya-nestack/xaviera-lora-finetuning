Put me down on a silly estate
In October weather
There inside my body anyway
Could it be?
Thought I said my last goodbye
Felt just like a feather
Put it back into the sky
Then fell
Fly me out of here
On a great jet trail that's turning into clouds
Just don't tell me
That I'm gonna have to sit here and wait for the fall out
Put me back on the floor if you want
With your great big hands
Who said I would be your fool anyway?
Stick a needle in my eye if I ever plan
To let you take me down and out so easy
Fly me out of here
On a great jet trail that's turning into clouds
Just don't tell me
That I'm gonna have to sit here and wait for the fallout
