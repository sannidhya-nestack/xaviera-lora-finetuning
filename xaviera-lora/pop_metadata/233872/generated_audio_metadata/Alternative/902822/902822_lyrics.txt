Must be you as you make a sound
As I climb from the underground
Resonate in the air
Silent sky everywhere
Calling to save you now
Let's push the world aside
Can I just stay a while
I'll be the only one
Calling to save you now
Let's push the world aside
Can I just stay a while
I'll be the only one
I'll be the only one
I'll be the only one
Illustrate what you see
Maybe then I'll find out
Read my mind, I can't describe
How I feel about you now
Calling to save you now
Let's push the world aside
Can I just stay awhile
I'll be the only one
Calling to save you now
Let's push the world aside
Can I just stay awhile
I'll be the only one
I'll be the only one
I'll be the only one
Calling to save you now
Let's push the world aside
Can I just stay a while
I'll be the only one
Calling to save you now
Let's push the world aside
Can I just stay a while
I'll be the only one
I'll be the only one
I'll be the only one
