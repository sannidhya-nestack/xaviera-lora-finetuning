She sees me for the monster that I am
Inside of me no one understands
So take my head for the crippled stance
I'll trip you out into a suicidal trance
You play it cool like you should
Don't you understand
These very tiptoes are gonna weight the debt
She killed me in train of a jukebox time
She killed me in train of a jukebox time
She killed me in train of a jukebox time
Hey hey hey
She killed me in train of a jukebox time
She killed me in train of a jukebox time
She killed me in train of a jukebox time
Hey, hey, hey
I'm just a low life, living high life
I'm just a low life
I'm just a low life, living high life
I'm just a low life
Get out my throat
Black lips
She killed me and trained, I'm a jukebox dime (She killed me and trained, I'm a jukebox dime) (She killed me and trained, I'm a jukebox dime)
I'm just a low life, living the high life
I'm just a low life, living the high life
I'm just a low life, living the high life
I'm just a low life, living the high life
She's more serrated than the knife
She got the air right out of my life
If I'm not dead, I'm living a lie
At my own funeral, you don't wanna cry (you don't wanna cry)
She shakes me for the loose cheeks that I am
Just like I lived and died once again
So take my head from buried in the sand
I'll sell my soul for a dirty one night stand
I'll lose you now and there's no second chance
My health is born through deliverance
She killed me in trade of a two box dime (she killed me in trade of a two box dime)
She killed me in trade of a two box dime
Hey, hey, hey
She killed me a train of a jukebox time
She killed me a train of a jukebox time
She killed me a train of a jukebox time
Hey, hey
She killed me and trained up a jukebox style
I'm just a lonely living my high life
She killed me and trained up a jukebox style
I'm just a lonely living my high life
She killed me and trained up a jukebox style
She killed me and trained up a jukebox style
She killed me and trained, I'm a jukebox style (She killed me and trained, I'm a jukebox style)
She killed me and trained, I'm a jukeybox style (She killed me and trained, I "m a jukeybox style)
She killed me and trained, I'm a jukeybox style (She killed me and trained, I'm a jukeybox style)
