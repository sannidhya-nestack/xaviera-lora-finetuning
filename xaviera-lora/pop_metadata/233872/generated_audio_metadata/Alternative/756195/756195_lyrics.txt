I'm in awe of you, and I mean all of you
Love I fell in, isn't spared of your rebellion
You're a stray dog, you're an outlaw
You're a lion, you're divine, but what to do now?
Tell me something I don't already know
Then I'll listen
With all the foolish words inside your mouth
Better put your fist in
With all the hunger that you swallow whole
I thought you'd get it
But you're a coward in a savior's suit
Just admit it
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, yeah, yeah
Where you gonna run, when all of you is numb
The freedom you seek looks a lot like prison to me
You're a loose end, you are pretend
You're a liar, I'm on fire but what to do now
When your heart is screaming out to you, don't you
Is it love, though, wild and unassured, worth the risking?
With all the hunger that you swallow whole, I thought you'd get in
But you're a coward in a savior's suit, just admit it
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, yeah, yeah
I'm in awe of you, and I mean all of you
I'm in all of you, and I mean all of you
You're a drug fix, I'm coming down quick
I'm breaking down, why can't you be the calm I'm feeling?
You are beautiful, you are cruel to know
You lift me up, you fuck me up, but what to do now?
