Third in Broadway when you got the call
April 1st supposed to be for foolish jokes and all that
And you were crushed under the weight of the news
Oh my my, oh my my
You don't know what to do
Oh my my, oh my my
I'll be there for you
One less, one less worry
Let me ease your mind
One less, one less worry
We could find the time now that
I've got you and you've got me
And we could sit back and enjoy the breeze
I've got you and you've got me
And we've got one less worry
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Constant worries, your mind spinning again
Seems these days your bed is your only friend
And I will try to do all that I can
It's a lonely climb, it's a lonely climb
You'll find the strength to shine again
Oh my my, oh my my
There's hope to hold on to
Oh my my, oh my my
I'll be there for you
One less, one less worry
Let me ease your mind
One less, one less worry
We could find the time
Now that I've got you and you've got me
We could sit back and enjoy the breeze
I've got you and you've got me
And we've got one less worry
I know sometimes
Life can be hard
Don't give up now
You've come so far
One less, one less worry
Let me ease your mind
One less, one less worry
We could find the time now that
I've got you and you've got me
We could sit back and enjoy the breeze
I've got you and you've got me
And we've got one less worry
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
