Wasting time and changing our faces
To impress the ones who erase them, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the moment, lose our own minds now
Don't hold back, we'll make it out somehow, oh, oh, oh
We'll kick, we'll kick the doors down
We'll find, we'll find a way out
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Just hold on, hold on, hold on
We were, we were mistaken
But now we are escaping
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Just hold on, hold on, hold on
Try to fit the mold that they built me
Stole the key and now I'll be set free oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Nothing's real there's pressure to fit in
Don't et there's no way to win this oh oh oh
Oh
We'll click, we'll kick the doors down
We'll find, we'll find a way out
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Just hold on, hold on, hold on
We were, we were mistaken
But now we are escaping
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Just hold on, hold on, hold on
I could never be stuck like wallpaper
Where every day I'm ripped apart
We'll remember and laugh about it later
We were always stronger from the start
We were always stronger from the start
We'll kick, we'll kick the doors down
We'll find, we'll find a way out
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Just hold on, hold on, hold on
We were, we were mistaken
But now we are escaping
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Just hold on, hold on, hold on
We'll click, we'll kick the doors down
We'll find, we'll find a way out
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Just hold on, hold on, hold on
We were, we were mistaken
But now we are escaping
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Just hold on, hold on, hold on
