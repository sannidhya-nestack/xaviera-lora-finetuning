I hear voices singing on the hill
Like a funeral I lay quiet and still
Call it what you will I know this
Despite a doubting mind I feel this is the end
That I'm found
The moon is high like a lamplight murdering the dim
The air is free and the sudden ice
Have you ever screamed into the night
At the end of a nightmare you cry
Following all around you promises
On fairy tale lies and canvases of steel and bones
But I'm fine
Wash clean all my sins
The moon is high like a lamplight murdering the dead
The air is free and so am I
And so am I, you see
