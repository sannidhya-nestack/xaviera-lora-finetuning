You are what you are, you're not the answer to everything
The only one little man behind the curtain
I am bigger than the sum of the words you boxed me in
Don't be surprised when both my eyes see more than you
True confession that I should have mentioned
You and me were always bound to change
Oh I found what I needed to believe in to see
The best of you was only my illusion
Oh I found what I needed to believe in to see
The rest of you is me
Now that I am free you are no longer drowning me
I swim to shore I won't take back what used to be
Now that the storm has passed, my sanity has brought my senses back
Losing me, always losing you
True confession that I should have mentioned
You and me were always bound to change
Oh, I found what I needed to believe in to see
The best of you was only my illusion
Oh, I found what I needed
I mean it's unbelieving to see the rest of you is me (is me)
I've heard that you're expecting me
Come crawling back on my knees
Well you should, well be expecting me
To prove you wrong spent on my own answer to me
I found what I needed to believe in to see
The best of you was only my illusion
Oh, I found what I needed to believe and to see
The best of you is me (is me)
The best of you is me (is me)
The best of you is you
