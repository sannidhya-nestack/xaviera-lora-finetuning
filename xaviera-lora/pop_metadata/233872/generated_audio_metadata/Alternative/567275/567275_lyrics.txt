One, two, three, wah! Yeah! Yeah!
I'm breaking the silence I've held within
Your throne I'll be taking as soon as I begin
I can remember how hard I've tried
Tried to ignore all the reasons why
You were always wrong for me
You were always wrong for me
We can fight now, but I've already won
I'm going all in and calling your bluff
It's enough, your game is up
I'll stop when you call it what it was (I'll stop when you call it what it was)
I'll stop when you call it what it was
I needed a love you could never give
The worst part was thinking of you alone with him
And how you could never just tell it right
The truth is the answer that you could never find
We can fight now but I've already won
I'm going all in and calling your bluff (it's enough)
Your game is up
I'll stop when you call it what it was (I'll stop when you call it what it was)
I'll stop when you call it what it was (I'll stop when you call it)
If you think it's complicated then you'll figure it out
Girl, I always knew you could
You can take it, you can take a little tiny bow
There's never been a doubt, you're good
Got this feeling, yeah, a feeling that is calling you out
Maybe you should listen, girl
You gotta take it, baby, take it'cause I'm calling you out
Now it's time to hear it
I'll stop when you call it what it was
It burns
We can fight now, but I've already won
I'm going all in and calling your bluff
It's enough
Your game is off
I'll stop when you call it what it was
I'll stop when you call it what it was
I'll stop when you call it what it was
I'll stop when you call it
You were always wrong
I'll stop when you call it
You were always wrong for me
You were always wrong
