All I am I owe half to you
All I dream I dream next to you
You are my reed
You are my reed song
You are my reed
You are my reed song
Take me deeper
The way the sky explodes it burns for us
The breeze that touches our skin, it sings through us
You are my reef, you are my reef song
You are my reef, you are my reef song
Take me
Deeper, take me deeper
Take me, take me, take me, take me
Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Take me deeper, take me deeper
All I am, I owe half to you
All I dream, I dream next to you
You are my reed
You are my reed song
You are my reed
You are my reed song
Take me deeper
Take me deeper
Hold me deeper
Comfort, take me, comfort, take me
