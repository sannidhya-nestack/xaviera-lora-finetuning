When the year had passed
These thoughts resounded in my head
Of where the time has gone
And why
With every fear I have
On that day I heard your name
And held its beauty in my hand
To dig beneath my feet
And bury it inside
Every part of you
Yes, even if the measures to the sea
Landlock me, swallowing the key
You know that I will do anything to love
Transcend what heart that's been meant to end
Something out below it grew
From this garden ground I stood
With great ascending arms
That wound it bends around every part of me
Yes, even if the measures to the sea
Landlocked me, swallowing the key
You know that I will do anything to let transcend
My heart that's bending end to end
You know that I will do anything to let transcend
My heart that's bending end to end
Yeah, my heart is spanning end to end
