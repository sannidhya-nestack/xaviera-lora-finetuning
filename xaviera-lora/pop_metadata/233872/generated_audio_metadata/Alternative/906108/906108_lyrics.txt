We'll take it step by step
At least that's what we said
My heart went into hiding
It's not like you put me first
You always saw the worst, could you?
I've given it time, just one time
Just one time, oh could you
I've given it time, just one time
Look at us from the past
Promising we would last
Expectations started
We never thought it through
But deep down we always knew
Could you
I've given it time, just one time
Just one time, oh could you?
I've given it time, just one time
Just one time
We'll take it step by step, at least that's what we said
Could you
Giving it time, just one time
Just one time, oh could you
Giving it time, just one time
Just one time
Just one time, just one time
Could you have given it time, just one time
