Underneath the moonlight, memories arise
Shadows of the past reflecting in my eyes
Whispers from the heart, things we can't et
Writing to my dear regrets
Dear regrets you linger still
In the silence you reveal
Every choice and every tear
Dear regrets you draw so near
Walking through the echoes of a life once known
Haunted by the choices, seeds that we have sown
In the quiet moments truths begin to send
Letters to my dear regrets
Dear regrets you linger still
In the silence you reveal
Every choice and every deal
The regrets you draw so near
As the night is fading, dawn begins to break
In the light of morning, see the paths we take
Every step we falter, every sun that sets
Whispers from our dear regrets
Dear regrets you linger still
In the silence you reveal
Every choice and every deal
Dear regrets you draw so near
In the empty maze of man
Dear regrets, we find our friends
Through the shadows and the friends
Goodbye my dear regrets
