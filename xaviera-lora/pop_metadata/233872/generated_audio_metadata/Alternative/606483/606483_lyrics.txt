If you wanna run then I won't follow
If you wanna crash into the ground
If you wanna break my heart keep going
It will barely make a sound
I'm finding it hard to raise my head
Up from my pillow
I'm finding it hard to get out of bed
Away from your side
I know I'm on the wrong side of you baby
You sit there staring at the door
I just cannot seem to find you all the answers
I don't know you anymore
But if you wanna cry, don't let me stop you
If you wanna say goodbye, then go
If you wanna hide, don't let me find you
I can't find you anymore
If you wanna run then I won't follow
If you wanna crash into the ground
If you wanna break my heart keep going
It will barely make a sound
I cannot recall the first time we met
As I cling to my pillow
I cannot recall the kind words you said
Silent by your side
I know I'm on the wrong side of you baby
When you sit there tearing me to shreds
A night where I am barely even breathing
Is there nothing left?
If you wanna cry don't let me start you
If you wanna say goodbye then go
If you wanna hide don't let me find you
I can't find you anymore
If you wanna run then I won't follow
If you wanna crash into the ground
If you wanna break my heart keep going
It will barely make a sound
You just sit there staring at my struggle
You keep me coming back for more
But right now we're barely even breathing
I can't hide it anymore, more
If you wanna cry, don't let me stop you
If you wanna say goodbye, then go
If you wanna hide, don't let me find you
I can't find you anymore
If you wanna run, then I won't follow
If you wanna crash into the ground
If you wanna break my heart, keep going
It will barely make a sound
