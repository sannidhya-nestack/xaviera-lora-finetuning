I'm just an old bag of grass, nobody wants me, oh
Every person I pass keeps their eyes focused forward as they scamper by me real fast, oh lord won't you save me
Won't you keep me when I crumble up and get swept in the trash
Don't you know I've been rehearsing
I've been keeping myself clean, oh
Just because you feel broken doesn't mean there aren't places to sell
Just because you feel groovy doesn't mean you won't find brand new ways to fail, oh yeah
I'm just an old bag of grass
Nobody wants me
I'll pour myself a tall glass
And I'll wait for the morning to shine
Some sunlight on my back
Yeah well nobody's perfect
Sometimes it's just worth it
Some days it's just all that you have
Yeah well nobody's perfect
Especially me, oh
Just because you feel broken
Doesn't mean there aren't places to sell
Just because you feel groovy
Doesn't mean you won't find brand new ways to fail
Oh, fail
Fail
Whoa, whoa, whoa
