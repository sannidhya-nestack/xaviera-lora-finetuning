And I won't believe that I'll be enslaved
For the rest of my days by my own ways
But you love me, you told me, you told me, you made me
And I won't be, I won't be the same way
And you want me, you want me to be free
You showed me how when you let me fall
you love me,'cause you love me
You helped me out when I gave it all
you love me, yeah you love me
So let me be
And I won't believe that I'd be enslaved
For the rest of my days I'll find my own way
But you love me, you told me, you told me, you made me
And I want me, I want me the same way
And you want me, you want me to be free
You showed me how and you led me far
Cause you love me, cause you love me
You helped me out when I came in
All cause you love me, yeah you love me
So let me be
Free, free, free
You're trying to fight all this pain
But you're still not alive to lean
All the promises in his name
You're willing to do this again
By yourself but you know you can't win
All your life has been
It isn't
But you love me
You told me, you told me, you made me
And I want me, I want me the same way
And you want me, you want me to be
You shook me out when you let me fall
you love me,'cause you love me
You helped me out when I gave it all
you love me, yeah you love me
So let me be
Free
Free
