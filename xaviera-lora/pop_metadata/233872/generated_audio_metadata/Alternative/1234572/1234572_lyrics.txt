In the pictures I see your shadow linger
A memory in the frame frozen in time
Underneath the moon's pale whisper
Your eyes, they glow in the night sunlight
Every snapshot, I catch it tight
In the silence, I hear you whisper goodbye
In my pictures, where dreams collide
You're the ghost in the black and white
Lost in the echoes of our last night
In my pictures, sister mine
Through the lens of the still mind
Through the lens, a world in greyscale
Your laughter's better in the quiet rooms
Fading echoes of our tale
In the shadows of the rooms
Each play a story and song
In the darkness your light I hope
In the pictures the dreams collide
You're the ghost in black and white
Lost in the echoes of flat earth
In the shadows of love news
Which frames the years of stone
