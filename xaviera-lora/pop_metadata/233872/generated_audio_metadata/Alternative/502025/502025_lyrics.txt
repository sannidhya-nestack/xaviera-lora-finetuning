So leave it to the tide and that next light
When weather's right
Come sailing home
Let the dark subside
Just leave it to one side, I'm on your side
When weather's right
Come sailing home again
Walk the land and see the show
Think of less and want for more
Down the way to keep the grey from blue
In a house on distant streets
Someone dreams a distant beach
And words they wait
So I know you're tired
So leave it to the tide in that next light
When weather's right
Come sailing home, let the dark subside
Just leave it to one side, I'm on your side
When my heart is right
You'll see it's swapped away
You'll see it's swapped away
So I know you're tired
So leave it to the tide and that's next light
When weather's right
Come sailing home let the dark subside
Just leave it to one side I'm on your side
When weather's right
You'll see it swept away
You'll see it swept away
You'll see it swept away
