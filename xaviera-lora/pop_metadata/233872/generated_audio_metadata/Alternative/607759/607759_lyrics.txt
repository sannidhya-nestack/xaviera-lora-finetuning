Come away from that window, you don't want to see it
Come sit here beside me, keep me sane
I've taken my chances, accepted the offer
I don't want to know
I just want to feel
In the sun, in the sun
Sometimes I still see it in the sun
Though I speak with the tongue of a stranger
I see through the eyes of a friend
Sometimes I don't know where I'm going
I don't know how to pretend
In the sun, in the sun
Sometimes I still see it in the sun
In the sun, in the sun
Sometimes I still see her in the sun
