Gazing at the oceans glow while the sun sets paint the sky
Dreams of summer softly flow
Letting worries drift away in a breeze we'll find our place
Underneath the starry show
Floating on the waves so free
In the night just you and me
You're all that I am dreaming of
You're all I have in my heart
Others in the evening light
Echo softly through the sand
Holding close the world feels right
Every moment setting cold
In your arms a love unfold
Whispered promises so bright
Floating on the waves so free
In the night just you and me
You're all that I am dreaming of
You're all I have in my heart, love
A night sky, our canopy
With you is where I'm meant to be
We'll dream until the morning sun
Together we'll become a squad
Floating all the way so free
In the night just you and me
You're all that I am dreaming of
You're all I have in my heart and love
