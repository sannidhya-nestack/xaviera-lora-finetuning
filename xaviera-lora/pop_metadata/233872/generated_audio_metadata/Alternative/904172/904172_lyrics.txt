I'm in the wake of an ever-veiling sky
That overcast to an endless night
And if I could, I'd give every living day
For just one dream of the other side
If there's another side
life is bleeding to a little passageway
It's shutting off the lock of no matter
A place that I could never reach
On my own, on my own
On my own, on my own
On my
On my own, on my own
There's a place I can never reach
On my own
I have descended seven miles down
The deepest part of the water sea
And if no anchor could reach to where I am
Then who will come to deliver me?
To deliver me?
Daylight is bleeding through
It's shining out of the lock of no matching key
A place that I can never reach
On my own, on my own, on my own
On my own, on my own, on my own, on my own
There's a place I can never reach
On my own, on my own
On my own, on my own
On my own, on my own
On my own, on my own
There's a place I can never reach
On my own
