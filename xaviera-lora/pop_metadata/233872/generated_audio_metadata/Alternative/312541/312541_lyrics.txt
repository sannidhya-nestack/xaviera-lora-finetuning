Where do I go from here?
Have I gone too far?
Where do I go from here?
Have I gone too far?
I'm running back to you, only you can see me through
This dark night that follows me home everyday
That follows me home everyday
I'm fighting for my sanity
When I am down, feeling low
I need you more than ever
I need you more than ever
When I'm down, feeling weak
I need you more than ever
I need you more than ever
Where do I go from here?
Have I gone too far?
I'm running back to you
Only you can see me through
This dark night
That follows me home everyday
That follows me home everyday
I'm fighting for my sanity
When I'm down feeling low
I need you more than ever
I need you more than ever
When I'm down feeling low
I need you more than ever
I need you more than ever
When I'm down
I need you more than ever
I need you more than ever
When I'm down (you know you want me)
I need you more than ever (you know you want me)
I need you more than ever
