Back where I wish I was from
People really know how to have fun
And they don't live in a dying town
The people come and party for miles around
They have no hate tax
They're all colors, whites and blacks
Back where I wish I was from
Let's go now, won't you come?
Put your hands in the air, move your hips and your feet
Shake your body to your own heartbeat
Put your hands in the air, move your hips and your feet
Shake your body to your own heartbeat
Back where I wish I was from
We don't have any bombs or guns
There's always a party in the street
Everyone's got plenty to eat
If you're fat, you're fat
And if you're small, you're small
Oh but there it doesn't matter at all
Back where I wish I was from
Let's go now, won't you come?
Put your hands in the air
Move your hips and your feet
Shake your body, do your own heartbeat
Put your hands in the air, move your hips and your feet
Shake your body, do your own heartbeat
Those people make me feel so good
They know how to put you at ease
There's always something great going down there
I wish I could be that now
That's where I wish I was from
There's a hope for everyone
There's always something you wanna do
And something you wanna learn about too
Religion that's a matter you don't have to choose
Muslim, Buddhist, Hindus, Christians and Jews
Back where I wish I was from
Let's go now, won't you come?
Put your hands in the air, move your hips and your feet
Shake your body to your own heartbeat
Shake your body to your own heartbeat
Back where I wish I was from
Back where I wish I was from
I wanna go back
I wanna go back, take me back
Oh please take me back
Back where I wish I was from
Let's go now won't you come
