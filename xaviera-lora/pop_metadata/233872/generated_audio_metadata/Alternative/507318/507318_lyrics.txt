Searching for a fast way out of here
Hands out working but no wheel to steer
Black backs cover all the signs I see
With the sun above us blinding me
The sun is setting fires all around
And the asphalt's melting on the burning ground
Been looking for a chance to say goodbye
Now at last I think you have a reason why
A reason why
Close my eyes as I hit the gas
Engines running getting nowhere fast
No man to side as far as I can see
No help for getting where I wanna be
Sunny city fires all around
And the asphalt's melting on the burning ground
Been looking for a chance to say goodbye
Now at last I think you have a reason why
A reason why
Looking for a chance to say goodbye
Now at last I think you have a reason why
Reason why
