Hear me speak, hear me breathe, hear me call to you
Hear me sing
Hear this song
Hear the ocean blue
Come into me you'll crash me free
Drink it from me you'll soon see
Hear me think, hear me blink
Hear me pray for your return
Hear my mind, hear my heartbeat
Hear the cool of its throat burns, it burns
You're coming to me with passing pain
Drink it through me, oh Susie
You're a siren
You're a shipwreck
Can't inspire'em
All hands on deck
You're a firefly
You're a dancing blue
You have to try
My siren boy
Skyward bright, fading light
Your deep-seated in my heart
Air escapes, ocean tapes
They'll never break us apart
Come into me, you're a passion free
I'm drinking from me, you're so easy
Come into me, you're a passion free
I'm drinking from me, you're so easy
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
