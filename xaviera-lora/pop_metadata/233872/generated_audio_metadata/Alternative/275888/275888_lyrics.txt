This tyranny has got me on my knees
Won't you please release me?
It starts to change the way I act
And my sense of reason
It holds me down with force strong
And it is increasing
the more I get, the more I want
Dead end time, dead end time, dead end time, dead end time
This tyranny's got me up on my knees
Won't you please release me?
It starts to change the way I act
And my sense of reason is emulsing down with force strong
And it is increasing'cause the more I get
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Daddy tonight
Daddy tonight
