Driving north to the setting sun
I heard our song, the cold plays on
You sing it loud, so off key
I laughed at you and you smiled at me
And I was waiting for the day when you'd come back and say you won't hit soon
I dream the white dress, beach house and kids
I guess forever was a lie
Walk home alone, late at night
In bed by myself, I turn off the lights
I go to sleep, think of when
What would've, should've, could've been
Ooh, ooh, mm
And I was waiting for the day
When you'd come back and say you wanted to
I dream of white dress beach house and kids
I guess forever was a lie
This is the last goodbye after all the tears that I've cried
Life's rising inside me forever won't control me
I'm not waiting for the day
When you come back and say you, say you wanted to, oh
Yeah, I guess forever
Goodbye
