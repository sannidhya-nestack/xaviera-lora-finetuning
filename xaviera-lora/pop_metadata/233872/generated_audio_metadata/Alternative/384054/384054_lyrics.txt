I think of you and I fantasize
I touch your lips, girl, I'm mystified
The fire's burning and you feel the heat
We'll spend all night making love and you'll sleep
Live with love
I wanna lie inside of you
Live with love
I wanna lie inside of you
It's just the way you're feeling tonight
That makes love so right
I don't know what you've done to me
Because you love such a misery
Liquid love
I take you places so far out of reach
Too soon an island on the Swedish beach
You drive my passion light, no one can
We'll spend all night making love in the sand
Live with love
I wanna drown inside of you
Live with love
I wanna drown inside of you
It's just the way you're feeling tonight
That makes love so right
I don't know what you've done to me
Because your love is such a mystery
Liquid love, yeah
I'm gonna give it to you this time
Liquid love, liquid love, liquid love, liquid love, liquid love
Liquid love, liquid love, liquid love, liquid love
Live with love, live with love
