She walks around in black
She knows what she has and then
She's got a friend somehow she knows
She's got the power over you
She walks around in black
She knows what she has to do
She had an angel on her side
But the devil's killed him off
Young love has driven me
So much further than I'd ever go
Young love has driven me
So much further than I'd ever go
Don't underestimate
A bully, yes, and take things
She against those who look her way
And will devour if you get in her way
Your love has driven me
So much further than I'd ever go
Your love has driven me
So much further than I'd ever go
She's got it
She's got it, yeah, yeah
She's got it
She's got it, yeah, yeah
The woman in black enters the room
Unexpectedly she captures souls wrapped in leather
She burns the hearts of cowardice men
To continue her path of destruction
Your love has driven me
So much further than I ever could
Your love has driven me
So much further than I ever could
So much further than I'd ever go
So much further than I'd ever go
So much further than I'd ever go
So much further than I'd ever go
