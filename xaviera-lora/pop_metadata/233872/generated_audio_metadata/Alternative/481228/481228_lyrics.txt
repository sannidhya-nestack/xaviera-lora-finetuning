I just feel a searing pain that eclipses breath
Evil has overcome my soul
Mercy for emotions I thought I could never control
The world moves to the altar of its own accord
Jagged lies, don't through our eyes give away what's in store
Decade is the beauty that once was so alive
I just feel a searing pain that's eclipses pride
Evil has overcome my soul
Mercy for emotions I thought I could never control
