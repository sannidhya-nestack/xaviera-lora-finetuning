Night's almost over, but I ain't done yet
Feeling lucky, you're glazing my bed
Around the corner, you're turning my head
From the moment I heard your groove I knew it's what I want
Hit me up with that rhythm
That rhythm, that rhythm
You got me moving right now, that rhythm
That rhythm, that rhythm
You got me moving right now
It's in the way that you move
You make the rhythm, you're right
You own it all of the time
We're just beginning to have a good time
This is living and living here just feels right
You take a moment, make it a highlight
From the moment I heard your groove
I knew it's what I want
Hit me up with that rhythm
That rhythm, that rhythm
You got me moving right now, that rhythm
That rhythm, that rhythm
You got me moving right now
It's in the way that you move
You make the rhythm, you ride
You own it all of the time
That rhythm, that rhythm
You got, you got that rhythm
That rhythm
You got, you got that rhythm
That rhythm
You got, you got that rhythm
That rhythm, that rhythm
That rhythm
We live with that rhythm
That rhythm, that rhythm
You got me moving right now
That rhythm, that rhythm
That rhythm, you got me moving right now
You got, you got that rhythm
You got, you got that rhythm
You got, you got that rhythm
