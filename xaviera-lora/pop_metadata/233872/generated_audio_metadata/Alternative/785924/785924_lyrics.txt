We're gonna make America great again, make America great (oh)
Make America great again, make America great (yeah that's right)
We're gonna make America great my friend before it gets too late
We're gonna make America great again
Make America great (that's right)
We're gonna make America great my friend
And baby I just can't wait (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Politically correct, since that is a guess
Like puffing off the wrong end of a lit cigarette
With China waiting on deck, not even breaking a sweat
Taking bets on the American up-and-coming train wreck
But have you all otten, it's Glover McDon, writing his office
Sam comes a-knockin' on your door to collect
For the mess that they caused while breakin' all our laws
Just to sustain an unsustainable national debt
We're gonna make America great again
Make America great
We're gonna make America great, my friend
Before it gets too late
We're gonna make America great again
Make America great
We're gonna make America great
My friend and baby I just can't wait
So here we go
I hear that Mexico's upset
He gonna regret all those years
Of taking advantage of this one sided relationship
But here's the safe bet only a fool wouldn't get
Cause that tequila sunrise is just about to sunset
Oh and there's one more thing that I ot to address
And this my friend believe me is the best one
Yeah we're gonna build a wall 125 feet tall
And tell Mexico a building they won't soon et
We're gonna make a big deal
Make America great again, make America great (yeah, that's right)
We're gonna make America great, my friend, before it gets too late (ooh)
We're gonna make America great again, make America great (who's with me?)
We're gonna make America great, my friend, baby, I just can't wait
I put the high life vanilla to the Huns from Attila
All my late night tweets became best sellers
I put the trailer in Manila closed the deal with Godzilla
Turned five wise guys into five good fellas
I collect frequent flyer miles
Leisurely watching the Travel Channel on my TV
The most interesting man in the world
He lives through my life by curiosity
We're gonna make a -<|24.08|>
Make America great again, make America great (Come on)
Make America great my friend before it gets too late (East side, west side)
We're gonna make America great again, make America great (Cruise with me)
We're gonna make America great my friend and baby I just can't wait (East coast, west coast)
We're gonna make America great again, make America great (come on)
We're gonna make America great my friend, before it gets too late (time, time, time)
We're gonna make America great again, make America great (whoa)
We're gonna make America great again, make America, great
