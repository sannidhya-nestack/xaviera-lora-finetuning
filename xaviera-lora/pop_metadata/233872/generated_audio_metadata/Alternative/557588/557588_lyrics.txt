So then I guess you gotta get away
Better best don't need a better day
Spending money instead of spending days
When the breakdown comes tell me what you gonna say now
No time to et the past
I guess some things are meant to last
Running things when you better run fast
When the breakdown comes breakdown comes
I can't sleep I can't breathe
I can't see myself in the mirror
Well I keep another pillow just to make sure I don't disappear
So I guess you gotta get away with dark nights
Turn to dark days on the edge while the edge falls away
When the breakdown comes, breakdown comes
Can't sleep, I can't breathe, I can't see myself in the mirror
What I keep under the pillow just to make sure I don't disappear
Swing to the beat, hug your pillow
Funny clips, drop your stare
Back to the door, pull the window
Fireballing smoke in the air
So then I guess you gotta get away
Better best don't mean a better day
Spend the money instead of spending days
When the breakdown comes tell me what you gonna say now
Time to et the past, I guess some things aren't meant to last
Run things, well you better run fast, when the breakdown comes, breakdown comes
Make your plans and take your stand, that's what they always say
Take control, just get a hold of the voices in your head (Don't hate, you gotta get through)
So I guess you gotta get away with dark nights
Turn to dark days on the edge while the edge falls away
When the fake doubt comes out
