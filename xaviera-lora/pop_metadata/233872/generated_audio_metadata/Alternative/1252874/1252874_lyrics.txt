In the stillness we gather round
Ancient echoes, secret ground
Flying flickers, whispers rise
Mystic camps beneath the skies
Candlelight ritual all this time
Waves of incense, souls align
Cycle joins purity
In the glow of a plant, a seed
Simmers covered in waxen form
Guardians of the common storm
Hands entwined we feel the flow
Of the secrets we bestow
Softly haunts the sacred tomb
Shadows dance in the afternoon
Light and shadow, ebony
Mysteries that we have seen
Candle burn ritual all this time
Waves of incense, souls aligned
Saccharine spirit heat
In the glow we plant the seed
Sand falls in the amber glow
Ancient wisdom we bestow
Kindling hope in the fire's heart
From this place we'll never part
Words unspoken yet they bind
Spirit paths weaves that wind
Enough with the truth and feels
Hearing that the light conceals
Camel burn ritual all this time
Waves of incense, souls aligned
Cycles run, spirits heed
In the glory plant the seed
As the flame begins to wane
Echoes of the suffering
Candle burn forever bright
Guiding us through endless night
