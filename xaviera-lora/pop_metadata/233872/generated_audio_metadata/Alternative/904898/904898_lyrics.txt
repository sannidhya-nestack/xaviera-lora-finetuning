Sometimes today is just a mountain I can't climb
I want to lie down all the time
But there's always someone left
To keep my hopes alive
To go to every time
I need love
I
Need love
It's the thought of you that gets me through
Keeps me from falling down
Thought of you that gets me through
Keeps me up brings me round
Thought of you the thought
And I know it's all down there somewhere in my mind
The things I can't find
That there must be someone there
To keep my hopes alive
To go to every time
I need love
It's the thought of you that gets me through and keeps me from falling down
The thought of you that gets me through and keeps me up, brings me round
Thought of you, the thought of
I'm in love
I need love
I need love
It's the thought of you that gets me through
Keeps me from falling down
Thought of you that
Gets me through that
Keeps me up, brings me round up
Thought of you that
Gets me through that
Keeps me from falling down up
Thought of you that
Gets me through that
Keeps me up, brings me round up
Thought I'd hear the song, ah
