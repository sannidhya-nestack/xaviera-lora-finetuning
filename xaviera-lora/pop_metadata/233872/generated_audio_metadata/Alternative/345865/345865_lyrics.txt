Will we ever come back
Will we ever see home again
Did we say our last goodbye
Have we really reached the end
Gonna be a different life
Say goodbye to your former life
Ooh
Was it ever in doubt
It would all be over one day
Didn't comprehend that it could end this way
Say goodbye to your former life
Gonna be a different life
The world is burning as it's turning
The code of decency is now a
The walls are shaking, the earth is quaking
Behind the smoke a million hearts are breaking
I remember it well, our life before this terror
We let it slip away, dropped down our guards in error
Gonna be a different life, say goodbye to your former life
The world is turning, as it's burning
Code of decency is now adjourning
The walls are shaking, the earth is quaking
Behind the smoke a million hearts are breaking
The world is burning as it's turning
The code of decency is now adjourning
The walls are shaking the earth is quaking
A million hearts behind the smoke are breaking
The world is burning
And as it's turning, the code of decency is now adjourning
The walls are shaking, the earth is quaking
A million hearts behind the smoke are breaking
Will we ever come back?
Will we ever see home again?
Will we ever come back?
