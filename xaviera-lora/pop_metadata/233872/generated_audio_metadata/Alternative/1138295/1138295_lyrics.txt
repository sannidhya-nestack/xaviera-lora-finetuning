Slowly rolling down the highway
Got my eyes on the sky above me
Easy breeze and only my way
Sun is shining and I hear that guitar play, yeah
Seas come along the coastline
Smoke my cigarette, I'm feeling fine
Cruise control, I'm taking my time
California dreaming'bout that girl of mine
I'm just using up my spare time
I'm just cruising on the coastline
Rolling in my Dyson on a Sunday afternoon
Got my taste of heaven and I ain't about to leave there soon
And no, no
She's been waiting out the morning
Laid back ways of God are tired and yawning
In her hand clutches a drawing
Of a mountainside where the rain is pouring
Pouring
I pull up inside her driveway
She comes to me with a smile on her face
Says "Hello baby, how was your day?"
I say "Honey, I can't complain"
I'm assuming it's a safe bet
We'll be taking in the sunset
Rolling in my Datsun on a Sunday afternoon
Got my taste of heaven and I ain't about to leave here soon
No, no
Darling when you're with me I could ride us to the moon
Let's pull up in five and get down to it like we wanna do
And I don't want to do it
And I don't want to do it
Yeah
