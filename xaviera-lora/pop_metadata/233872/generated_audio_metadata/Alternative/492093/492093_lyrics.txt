You can smash your love on stage
You can drink yourself to death
You can stay a boy forever
You can burn with every breath
The bells still ring
The bells ring
You can cut your hand to pieces
You can choke on a plastic spoon
You can bet your future ives you
Maybe you can shoot the moon
The bells still ring
The bells ring
The bells still ring
The bells ring
Song to Stolze
Song to Stolze
Song to Stolze
Yeah
Song to Stool J
Song to Stool J
Song to Stool J
Yeah
Song to Stool J
Song to Stool J
Song to Storch a land
I love you
