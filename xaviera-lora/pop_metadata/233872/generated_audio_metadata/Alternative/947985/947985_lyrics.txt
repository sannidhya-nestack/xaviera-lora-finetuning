I, I, I, I, I
Because you are not there
Because now is not there
Because now is not there
Oh oh oh
Because now is not the end
Because you are not there
Because now is not the end
I feel more alive now than I ever have in my life
I have a chance to live as I dream
This is the world you've made yourself
Now you have to live in it
One time, one time is all you need
One time, one time is all you need
One time, one time is all you need
Faith is bigger than your fear
I, I, I
Because you are not there
Because now is not there
Because now is not the end
Because now is not the end
Because now is not the end
Because now is not the end
