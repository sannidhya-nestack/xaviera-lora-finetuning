I came to control your life
I came to control your life
I came to control your life
And I'm here to let you know
I came to control your life
And I'm here to let you know
I came to control your life
I came to control your life
I came to control your life
When I needed to know
I came to control your life
When I'm not here to let you know
Frankens, the agony
The fear, you agitation, you're scared
You want to escape
The blood is too hot, there's no eloping
I feel so happy
I adore the frank glance of your eyes
I want to have you
I'm obsessed with the way you feel
I'm turned on by your body's trepidation
Each movement of your constant glimpses with hesitation
I can't help my attraction to your affliction
I feel like you're so chunky of conviction
I'm fascinated by your anxious emotion
To see you suffering is my devotion
It's terrible
Get away to escape my obsession
My thoughts are trapped in my confession
It's favorable
Get away to escape my obsession
My thoughts are trapped in my confession
I came to control your life
I came to control your life
I came to control your life
And I'm here to let you know
I came to control your life
And I'm here to let you know
I came to control your life
I came to control your life
I came to control your life
I came to control your life
I came to control your life
When I'm here to let you know
I came to control your life
When I'm here to let you know
I came to control your life
I came to control your life
I came to control your life
I came to control your life
Enjoying the painful expression of your face
When touching your skin you feel the pressure of the trace
I'm tempering your breathing of excitement
By torching your whip I'm serious frightening
Convince me to refrain from my pleasure
Because my blood is led by a throbbing pain
The tension of my tortured temptation
My boundaries affections are without limitation
I can't help my attraction to your affliction
I feel like a soul chunky of conviction
I'm fascinated by your anxious emotion
To see you suffering it's my devotion
Is there a way to escape my obsession?
My thoughts are trapped in my confession
I can't tell my attraction to your affliction
I feel like a soul junkie of conviction
I'm fascinated by your anxious emotion
To see you suffering is my devotion
Is there a way to escape my obsession?
My thoughts are trapped in my confession
Instable, get away to escape my obsession
My thoughts are trapped in my confession
I came to control your life
And I'm here to make you notice
I came to control your life
And I'm here, I'm changing your world
