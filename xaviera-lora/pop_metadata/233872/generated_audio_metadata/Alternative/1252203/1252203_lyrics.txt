Stuck in this game
Can't find my way
Pressing buttons
Night and day
Spaceship fly
Through the night
Pixel screens
Out of sight
Space bar is scared gotta break free
Heard you alive calling me
Distant stars
Call my name
Rocket fuel
In my veins
Zero gravity
Sets me free
Floating high
Endlessly
Stuck in this game
Can't find my way
Pressing buttons
Might end day
Spaceships fly
Through the night
Pixel streams
Out of sight
Space bar escape gotta break free
Virtual life calling me
This is how it's called my name
Rocket fuel, rocket fuel in my face
In my face, in my face
Zero gravity sets me free
Sets me free, floating high
Floating high
Endlessly, endlessly
Space bar escape, calibrate free
Virtual life calling me
Twisting stars call my name
Rocket fuel in my veins
Zero gravity sets me free
Floating high, endlessly
Virtual life calling me
Calling me
