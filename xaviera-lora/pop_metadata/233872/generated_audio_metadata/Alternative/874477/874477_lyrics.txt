You're a blade across my soul
I'm a jewel that you once stole
You're the one I always wanna hold
You're the mud and I'm the gold, the gold
You're a gun against my head
I'm the words you left unsaid
I'm a poor girl dreaming I'm the queen
You're a blind man learning how to read
You're the clouds across the sky
I'm the sun that caught your eye
Gonna drive me down, down, down with you
Because you're the Joker and I'm the fool
Joker, Joker, Joker, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Joker, Joker, Joker, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Asmodeus
I, I, I, I, I, I,
I, I, I, I, I,
I, I, I, I, I,
I, I, I, I, I,
I, I, I, I, I,
You're a prisoner on the run
You're gonna tell me I'm the one
That I should take your hand and we'll run away
You're the one I just can't save, can't save
I think I've been here before
Devil knocking at my door
Don't think you mean to be so cruel
But still you're the joker and I'm the fool
Joker, Joker, Joker, Joker, Joker, Joker, Joker, Joker, Joker, Joker, Joker, Joker
(Joker, Joker, I don't have a friend)
(Joker, Joker, I don't have)
(Joker, Joker, I don't have, I don't have)
(Joker, Joker, I don't have friends)
I'm fine
I'm fine
I'm fine
I'm fine
I'm fine
I'm fine
I'm fine
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
