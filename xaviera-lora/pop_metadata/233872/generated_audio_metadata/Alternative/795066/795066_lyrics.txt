All my dream girls melt away
Some say there's no such thing
Good things come to those who fake
All this nonsense makes you think
I hate you all
I hate everyone
I'm going on this slip
Puppy love can fry your brain
Common sense has outdated
So run run run away
Before you take the bait
I hate you all
I hate everyone
I'm going home to sleep
I hate you all
I hate everyone
I'm going home to sleep
I don't care about the hype I'm hearing
Hype is for the counterfeit
We make plans as if the world depends on it
Sometimes we just need to print
I hate you all
I hate everyone
I'm going home to sleep
I hate you all
I hate everyone
I'm going home to sleep
I hate you all
I hate everyone
I'm going home to sleep
I hate you all, I hate everyone
I'm going home to sleep
