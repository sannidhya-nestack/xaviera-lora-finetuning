We're building here to settle
But you want to tear it down
Cause you're hoping to discover
A city underground
We raised the highest mountains
Arranged with no ravines
But you try to dig a canyon
A valley in between
It feels like you've come awake
By light of the morning breaking through
The night we were in love
I'm eastbound on a highway
Gone westward in the sky
You're bending the horizon
Through every mile you incline
Your heart is deviating
The rhythm of my own
Corresponding to the distance
From each other we have grown
It feels like I've come awake
By light of the morning breaking through
The night we were in love
We lived our lives but never are awaken from sleep
You have not
And we're dreamers feeding to the light, so
We were dreamers feeding to the light, so
We were dreamers beating to the loud sound
We were dreamers beating to the loud sound
