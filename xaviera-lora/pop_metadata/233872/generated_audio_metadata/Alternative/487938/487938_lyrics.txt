You try to break away but just can't move
Like you're walking all night stuck in a groove
You slip and you slide and couldn't see what's inside
Now it's time to fade out
It's blue when you're around it wrecks your day
You struggle to escape but that's okay
You can't magnetize while surrounded by eyes
Now it's time to fade out
It's so pure, so deep
Come walk these streets
And leave all behind
As you take some time to
Equalize, sensitize
Purify all that you know
Stabilize, fantasize
things might work out right
If you fade out
Still gotta fill it up to overflow
You're moving so fast but thinking so slow
Before we create we must first reinstate
As we both just faded out
It's blowing you around and wrecks your day
You struggle to escape but that's okay
You can't magnetize while surrounded by eyes
Now it's time to fade out
It's so pure, so deep
Cover all of these streets
And leave all behind
As you take some time to
Equalize, sensitize, purify all that you know
Stabilize, fantasize,'cause things might work out right
If you fade out
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Equalize, sensitize
Purify all that you know
Stabilize, fantasize
things might work out right
If you fade out
