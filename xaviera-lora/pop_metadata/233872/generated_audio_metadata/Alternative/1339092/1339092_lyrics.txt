Tell me you're coming home
I write the words that bring you back to me
Tell me you're coming'round
I sing the song that brings you back to me
Yeah, you're on your way
I feel you near
Show me where I went wrong
I need to know the place I wounded you
Trust me to get it right
I know you need to feel you're listened to
Yeah, you're on your way
Yeah, I feel you near
Yeah, you're on your way
Yeah, I feel you
Ooh yeah yeah
Ooh yeah yeah
Ooh yeah yeah
Ooh yeah yeah
Tell me you're coming home
I write the words to bring you back to me
Tell me you're coming round
I'll sing the song that brings you back to me
Tell me you're coming home
