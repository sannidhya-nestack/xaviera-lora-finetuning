Don't need your company
I want you now and forever
You move me easily
I never ever ever want us to sever
This time I'll do things right
And if you promise to be mine
I'll walk alone
I'll walk alone
I walk the line, I walk the line, I walk the line
My soul burns in the sun
Like a screaming fool alone in the desert
Just say that I'm the one
And I'll rid your world from every single hazard
This time I'll do things right
And if you promise to be mine
I'll walk the line
I'll walk the line
I'll walk the line
I walk the line (I walk the line) I walk the line
I walk the line (I walk the line) I walk the line
Don't need your company
I want you now and forever
You move me easily
I never ever ever wanna sever
This time I'll do things right
And if you promise to be mine
I walk the line, I walk the line, I walk the line
I walk the line (I walk the line) I walk the line (I walk the line)
I need your company (I walk the line) I want you there with me (I walk the line)
You move me easily (I walk the line) I never let you go (I walk the line)
I'm through prayers and a song (I walk the line) I've been through my life
I walk the line, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
