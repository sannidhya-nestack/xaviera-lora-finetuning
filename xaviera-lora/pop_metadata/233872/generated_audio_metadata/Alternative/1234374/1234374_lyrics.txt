Well down Main Street where the night is alive I see a black car rollin' in
About a quarter past five, chrome shinin' under the neon lights
Two steps out, the lawn's so bright
Brawns in black cars, stealin' the scene
With a look so fierce and a style so lean
They'll pick up cars wherever they roam
Brawns in black cars making this town their home
Love the jacket and the hair done right
She's a modern penny with the stars in her sight
Foot on the pedal with a slight grin
She makes me move, destined to win
Bums in black hearts
Causing a stir with a rumble so loud
Feel her eyes on the horizon chasing me
Dream, bums in black hearts
The ultimate team
Oh, they come from nowhere, taking the lead
With every turn in their fantasy
The legend born on the open road
In black cars they can't go
Oh, they come from nowhere, taking the lead
They never return, they're planned to cede
And the legend born on the open road
In black cars, they can't go
