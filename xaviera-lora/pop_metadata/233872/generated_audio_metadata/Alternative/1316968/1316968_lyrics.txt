Day after day you wander around
Searching for what's truly found in your mind
Day after light starts to shine
Illuminating thoughts divine
You'll be fine
Oh you'll find your way
Through the clouds you'll sway in the breeze
Oh, just take your time, let it flow, unwind, be at ease
Look at the sky, it's all within reach, lessons learned, lives cared
Free speech, take a chance, look at the sun, you'll rise and you'll glow
With every step, you'll surely know how
There's a spark that you hold in your heart so bold let it shine
In the moments you embrace you'll find your own place in due time
Oh you'll find your way through the clouds you'll sway in the breeze
Oh, just take your time, let it flow, unwind, be at ease
