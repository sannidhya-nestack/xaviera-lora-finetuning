My favorite waste of time
Laughs with her head back
Speaks in every language and I act like I understand
My fine feathered friend
Flies low to the ground
I stand on the ground and wait for her to land
She spins like leaves around me
I depend on the wind
I get caught in it again
I would
Wait forever for five more minutes and one last kiss
Even though I've been born against loving like this
They say that eyes go bad
Well a fool goes blind
As I watch the world fall apart
Around my favorite waste of time
Somebody tie me, look at me go, I'm going so fast
Somebody stop me, and shake me by the shoulders
I'm acting like this thing is gonna last
She breaks like waves around me
I depend on the wind
I get caught in it again
I would wait forever for five more minutes and one last kiss
Even though I've been born against loving like this
They say that eyes go bad while a fool goes blind
As I watch the world fall apart
Around my favorite waste of time
I accuse the world of revolving around her
And she shakes her finger at me
And says don't break so easily
So easily we'll break in two
We're wasting so much time together
But what else would you rather do?
I know I won't waste time forever
I'd have been on the wind, I'd get caught in it again
I would wait forever for five more minutes and one last kiss
Even though I've been warned against loving like this
And they say that eyes go bad, little fool goes blind
As I watch the world fall apart, around my favorite waste of time
Around my favorite waste of time
Around my favorite waste of time
