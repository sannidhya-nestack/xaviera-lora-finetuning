Why won't you smile as the sun goes down
The city's alive in this sleepy town
The twilight falls on your silent crown
Oh why won't you smile
Darling stay awhile
In this dreamy haze
Feel the summer's grace
The stars align
In the evening air
The night is kind to those who dare
But your heart's confined to a whispered despair
Oh, why won't you smile?
Darling, stay awhile
In this dreamy haze
Feel the summer's breeze
Love's a gentle breeze
That you can't deny
So open your eyes
And let it pass you by
Oh, why won't you smile
Darling, stay awhile
In this dreamy haze
Feel the summer's grace
