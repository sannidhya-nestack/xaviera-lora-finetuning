It's all about keeping the pain at bay, now you've gone away
It's all about keeping the pain at bay
Now you've gone away
There's no need to be alone
There's no need to be alone
Why aren't you with me?
Why did you leave me?
We're still here, separation's clear
But we'll wake up, living without you
You have tried hard now to beat us, to beat us
Curled up like a dead fetus, a dead fetus
There's no needle in your heart
But there's a needle in your heart
Yeah, there's a needle in your heart
Why aren't you with me?
Why did you leave me?
We're still here
Separation's fair
While we're awake and living without you
We're still here
Separation's fair
What will we do living without you?
We're still here, separation's clear
What will we do living without you?
We're still here, separation's clear
