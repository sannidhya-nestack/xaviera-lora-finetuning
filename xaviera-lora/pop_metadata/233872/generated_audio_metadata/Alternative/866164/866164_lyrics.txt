Maybe I'm lost in the wind
Come on over, we can do funny things
So you see I'm solo
I'm just trying to find out what happened'cause
I remember all those mystical colors
They filled up my heart and tore me apart
And I feel like it's so wrong but so right
And I don't know
And I don't know
Caught me on fire again
Wish I didn't do the things that I've done
Waking up to all this mess
Maybe I'm trying to help myself feel a little less
I remember all those mystical colors
They filled up my heart and tore me apart
And I feel like it's all wrong but it's alright
And I don't know
And I don't know
I remember all those mystical colors
They filled up my heart and tore me apart
And I feel like it's so wrong but so right
And I don't know
And I don't know
