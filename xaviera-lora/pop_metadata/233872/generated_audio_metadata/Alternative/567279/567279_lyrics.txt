I see no end to the violence
And I'm no stranger to this place, you know
We've fought these battles many times before
And now we stand here all alone (way from home, we know)
The place the heart will go
When the rains come, will it wash away?
When the rains come, will it wash away?
Will it wash away the hurt? Wash away the pain?
When the rain comes, will it wash us all away?
No one inside, lost in the silence
In the dark, no place to go
So far from everything you've ever known
You feel the chill down to the bone (away from)
Away from all we know, away from all we know, away from all we know
When the rains come
Will it wash away
When the rains come
Will it wash away
Will it wash away the hurt
Wash away the pain
When the rain comes
Will it wash us all away
I see the water rising
With no end in sight
I see the water rising
With no end in sight
(Where you're flowing along)
Away from all we know
When the rains come, will it wash away?
When the rains come, will it wash away?
Will it wash away the hurt? Wash away the pain?
When the rain comes, will it wash us all away?
Really wash us all away
