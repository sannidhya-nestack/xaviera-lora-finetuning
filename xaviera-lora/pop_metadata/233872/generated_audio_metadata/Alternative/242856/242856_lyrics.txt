You can't scream, you can't scream in between
Loving me and coming clean
Scream baby scream, the windows shut
Let me know when you've had enough
You're on the last of a death wish binge
No fortune teller could foresee these things
Your life got lost between the cracks
You burned your bridges now you can't go back
But you can't scream, you can't scream all you want
Scream like hell and throw those pots
Scream baby scream, you're living now
You will make it
Soon somehow your fallen smile gives away your blue
But saving face never did suit you
Someday time's gonna let you know
That you were wrong to ever let me go
Who can scream, you can't scream all you want
Scream at heaven and scream at God
Scream at the devil until you're blue
Scream in the mirror right back at you
Scream, scream, it's in between
Loving me and comically
Scream baby scream
Cause it's alright
It's just another fucked up night
Scream, yeah, scream, scream
