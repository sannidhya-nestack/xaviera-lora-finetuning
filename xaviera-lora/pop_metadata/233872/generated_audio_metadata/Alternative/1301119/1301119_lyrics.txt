Catching clouds on a Sunday morning
Chasing whispers without a warning
Dancing in the daylight dawning
I don't understand the sound
Maybe when the sun goes down, oh
Riding lines painting us
Dreams that make us fly
Rolling forward on waves of time
Seeking rhythm and notes that chime
A symphony in every ride
I don't understand
What's next
Maybe when the moon reflects so
Bright in our eyes
Painting in the sky
Dreams that make us alive
Come to life
we're gonna set this place
On the new spinning magic stage
Sounds of wonders on the strings
Let it go, let it go
Riding hearts painted in the sky
Dreams that make us fly to the light
