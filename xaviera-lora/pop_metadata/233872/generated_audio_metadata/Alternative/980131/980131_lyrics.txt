It's a wild summer's night
The whole wide world is fast asleep
It's a wild summer's night
An old tin can is blowing around the street
On a wild summer's night
It's the middle of June
But it feels more like winter
The weather it feels a lot like me
A little crazy but in no way bitter
There's a supernatural energy
I hear the wind is trying to tell me
All the secrets in life I wish I knew
The rain, it starts to fall, but not too heavy
I hear the seagulls cry, so I close my eyes
It's a wild summer's night
I am all alone, that's just the way it is
I had romance
I blew my chance
I betrayed my love for another kiss
Oh yes I did
Oh yes I did
On a white summer's night
Oh, on a wild summer's night
Oh, on a wild summer's night
Oh, on a wild summer's night
On a wild summer's night
