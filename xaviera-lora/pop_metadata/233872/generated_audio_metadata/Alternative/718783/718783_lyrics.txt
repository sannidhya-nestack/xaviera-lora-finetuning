Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Pushing sand through our toes
Let's watch the sun dip low
Tide waters wash real slow
Taking my hand down the street
Toasting beer cans in heat
Moon shines so bright
We can turn off the lights
Let this night last forever
Let the world stand still
Don't let me wake up'cause it's morning
I'm not ready for forever to end
Sails glide through the grass
Nothing like down home country class
Wear blue-eyed wings and key lime drinks
Cover history in sweet low country
Let this night last forever
Let the world stand still
Don't let me wake up'cause it's morning
I'm not ready for forever to end
Right here tonight is like the 4th of July
Especially when we're making love in the moonlight
Let this night last forever
Let the world stand still
Don't let me wake up'cause it's morning
I'm not ready for forever to end
I'm not ready for forever to end
I'm not ready for forever to end
