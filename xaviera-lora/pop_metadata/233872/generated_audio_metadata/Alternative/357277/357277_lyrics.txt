Take a step inside and recognize
This isn't what it seems
Of people all around just laughing and
Forming little teams
Take another step and realize
This place intoxicates all who have dreams
That it's safe
'Cause I heard him say
I will turn you into wastelands
Be another one who's wasted
Where will it have gone tomorrow?
Try to find it out on your own
Take a step back as it frightens me
And turn the other way
Never look back in directions that
Existed here today
Close the door and move away from it
Searching has begun for what I crave
I heard it say
'Cause I heard him say
I will turn you into wastelands
Be another one who's wasted
Where will it have gone tomorrow
Try to find it out on your own
Take a step inside and recognize
This isn't what it seems
Of people all around just laughing and
Forming little teams
Take another step and realize
This place intoxicates all who had dreams
That hurt the same
'Cause I heard him say
