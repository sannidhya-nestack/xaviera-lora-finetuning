She could be a Charlie's Angel
She could be the Antichrist
She's on the FBI's most wanted list
For international bank heist
She could be a double agent
If she'd only pick your side
She says that limiting her options is occupational suicide
What's on the other side of the mask?
I'm sorry but I have to ask
Girl what's your name?
Girl
Girl, what's your name?
She's a killer on the rampage
And she's a thief out on the run
And she could break your neck, barehanded man
Yeah, she could steal fire from the sun
And no one knows just where she came from
And no one's ever seen her face
She'd only fingerprints or evidence
No she never leaves a trace
Girl
Girl, what's your name?
Girl, girl, what's your name?
(I've got a note)
Girl, girl, what's your name?
(I've got a note)
Girl
Girl, what's your name? (Can anybody tell me your name?)
Well, I don't know, uh-uh-oh
