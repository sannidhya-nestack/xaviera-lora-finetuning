Got married in autumn, but you were not there in ice to me
And you made me cry
I hope that you know this baby
it's true
You don't owe me anything
I don't owe you
Watch me walk away
You don't owe me
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
We met early that August
You stole flowers and gave them to me
I drew X's and O's while you were digging for gold
You have skeletons in your closet
That could scare Frankenstein
I know that
You tried so hard to hide them
But they were too easy to find
Don't be worried'cause
You don't know me
Ooh, I don't know you
Anything you don't owe me
Anymore
Anymore
I dare anymore
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
