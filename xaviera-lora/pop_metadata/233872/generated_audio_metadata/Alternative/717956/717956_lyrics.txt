Seeing the queen of the big head universe
Elegant extravaganza so far away
So again, and again, and again, and again, and again
If at night our stars collide
If it keeps you up all night
I sing the queen of the pig head universe
Soon the queen of the pig heads
Stars go out in the light
And they stop in the middle of the sunlight's night
Helicon extravaganza so far away
Circle again and again
If at night our stars collide
If it keeps you up all night
I've been the queen of the big head universe
Seem the queen of the big head universe
