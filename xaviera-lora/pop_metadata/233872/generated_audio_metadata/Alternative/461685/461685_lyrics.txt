Welcome to the show, I'm so glad that you could make it
I've been falling apart lately
And I can no longer fake it
Because of you
Because of you
The sorrow comes flooding in
Cut the flesh and make it bleed
Needles sifting through my skin
It makes me feel like this is what I need because of you
Because of you
You made it just in time to watch it all end
You made it just in time to watch me make myself dead
Darling, welcome to the show
Everyone here wants your name but I already know
Darling, welcome to the show
I'm so glad that you could make it
I've been falling apart lately
And I can no longer fake it
Because of you
Because of you
Because of you
You made it just in time to watch it all end
You made it just in time to watch me make myself dance
Darling, welcome to the show
Everyone here wants your name but I already know
But I already know
