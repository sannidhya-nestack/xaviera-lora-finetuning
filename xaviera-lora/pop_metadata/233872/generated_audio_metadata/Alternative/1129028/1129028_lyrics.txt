Back to, back to, back to, listen listen listen
Back to, back to, back to, listen listen listen
Can you feel how our time is a gift to give to lift our love
Our time is a gift, a gift to lift our love
Back to, back to
Are we all the same? Suffering in pain
Holding back our happiness and keeping it to blame
Are we all the same? Are we all the same?
I move into your story
You tell me who you are
Are you walking far from glory?
I see where you are
Are we all the same? Are we all the same? (Are we all the same? Are we all the same?)
Dreaming of suffering and pain, are we all the same? Are we all the same (Are we all the same? Are we all the same?)
Are we all the same? Are we all the same? Are we all the same?
Do, back, do, suffering, pain
Beholding back our happiness and putting it to blame
Are we all the same? Are we all the same? Are we all the same? Are we all the same?
I'll be back in a minute.
