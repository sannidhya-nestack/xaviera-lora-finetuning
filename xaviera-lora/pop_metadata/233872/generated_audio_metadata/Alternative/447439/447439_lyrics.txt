It was a Friday night and a honky-tonk outside of town
They had a four-band build with the cats really laying it down
Yeah, the dance floor was filled with the boppers really getting down
When up comes the owner, a-cussin' and a-wearin' a frown
He said, "I hope you're having fun, I hope it's what you came here for
You've been getting five bucks from everyone who walks in the door"
But the bartender's lonesome and he hadn't had a drink to pour
And the waitress just quit and she said we didn't need her no more
This ain't no coffeehouse, they got time lemonade
And I couldn't give a damn about whatever was the music you played
And I really don't care about whatever was the deal we made
There better be some drinking if you're thinking that you're gonna get paid
Well just about then there was a grandma playing the slots
And the bell started ringing when grandma hit the jackpot
Grandma screamed, said, "Mom, as lucky as can be
So leave the band alone and buy everyone a drink on me"
They say no coffee, I say got time lemonade
And I couldn't give a damn about whatever was the music you played
And I really don't care about whatever was the deal we made
We're better off just freaking it and thinking that you're gonna get paid
So if you came here tonight and all you're gonna do is dance
The waitress and the owner are sure to be losing their pants
And I was just thinking that there really ought to be a law
That if you ain't gonna drink, you gotta bring your grandma
This ain't no coffee house, ain't got thyme lemonade
And I couldn't give a damn about whatever was the music you played
And I really don't care about whatever was the deal we made
There better be some drinking if you're thinking that you're gonna get paid
Yeah there better be some drinking if you're thinking that you're gonna get paid
You know we all been drinking and we're hoping that we're gonna get laid
