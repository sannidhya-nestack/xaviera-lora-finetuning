Me and my dead friend Joyce can't seem to agree
He points to the poetry of nature and I just see a tree
A double or eleven starts under my knee
When my dead friend Joyce starts telling me what he sees
I turn the light on and my dead friend's gone
I turn the light on and my dead friend's gone
I turn the light on and my dead friend's gone
Watching the sunset sit on the backs of cows
He says you ought to learn to speak Latin but I don't want to learn how
Dull old Eleven starts slapping my knee
When my dead friend Joyce starts telling me what he sees
I turn the light on and my dead friend's gone
I turn the light on and my dead friend's gone
I turn the light on and my dead friend's gone
My different choice says I got no choice
Smoking my cigarettes he comes to me in the shape of you
I'm double or eleven start sweating on me
When my different choice starts telling me what is it
Turn the light on and my dead friend's gone
I turn the light on and my dead friend's gone
I turn the light on and my dead friend's gone
I turn the light on and my dead friend's gone
