You never lose, I love it, it might be hard to see
You choose who you, I love it, see the debris of me
Babies in my head tonight, I said oh yeah (oh yeah)
These things pop in and out, I said oh yeah (oh yeah)
Am I glad, am I sad, I don't know (he don't know)
Am I mad, am I bad, I guess so (will we ever see)
You never lose my loving
It might be hard to see
You choose who you are loving
See the debris of me
Amused by love a hundred times I said oh yeah (oh yeah)
A heart once made to break I said oh yeah (oh yeah)
Forever is true I'm over you
Live I can live outside of you (all my days are bright)
You never lose my lovin'
It might be hard to see
You choose who you are lovin'
See the debris of me
You never lose, I love it
It might be hard to see
You choose who you, I love it
See the debris of me
