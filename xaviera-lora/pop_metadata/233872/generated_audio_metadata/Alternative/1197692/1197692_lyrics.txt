Always, I'll follow you, I promise
And time will get us done
You'll have me by your side
If I'm ready to be there
No matter hell or heaven
I'll be there by your side
I'll be by your side
When you want to hide
When you're sad and blue
I'll be next to you
Always I'll follow you, I promise
I'm pretty sure you'll love this
I will be by your side
I'll be by your side
When you want to hide
When you're sad and blue
I'll be next to you
I'll be by your side
I'll be next to you
