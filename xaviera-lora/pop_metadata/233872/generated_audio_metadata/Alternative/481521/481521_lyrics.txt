So perfect what's not to like
The things you care for never ever ever leave your sight
Except for me and I'm sick and tired been chopped and run
And maybe once could try to prove me wrong
Show me how you feel or lose you
A little honesty is always best
Can't put my life on hold'til who knows when
So get your act together or the future
You're in love with me or you're not
Tearing the days apart
He loves you loves you not until he loves you off your guard
So confusing and so one day you'll love me
Next you don't, a minute in your arms then all alone
Hard to figure out what's happening
A little honesty is always best
Can't put my life on hold'til who knows when
So get your act together up the front door
You're in love with me or you're not
You're still in love with me
You're still in love with me
You're still alive but you're not
A little honesty is always best
Can't put my life on hold'til who knows when
So get your act together up the front
You're, you're relying on me, are you?
A little honesty is always best
Can't put my life on hold'til who knows, yeah
So get your act together, other friends, yeah
You're in love with me, are you not?
