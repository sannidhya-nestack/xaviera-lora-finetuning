For six weeks
I was so carefully hollowed out
While she wore her German army coat
Sculpted by a rose
Which I will now become
Carved by a rose
I threw caution to the wind
In the old pavilion
I was just a reaper for
My nervous key unlocks the door for
A German army corpse
Sculpted by a rose
The German army coat
Carved by a rose
Hegemony, I've been stripped and I've been teased
Sculpted by the wind, my body gets hard to see
Hegemony, I've been sculpted by the rush
Carved by your sentimental gush
The German army now
I just have to let it go
Skelter by the ground
I've been combed what I've been thrown
The German army now
Like a pile of dying snow
Carved by others
Melting hapless in the floor
