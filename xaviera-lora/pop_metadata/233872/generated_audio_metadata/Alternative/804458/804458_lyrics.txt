Baby, how am I ever gonna quit you?
lately, feels like you're not even into
My cray cray, show me what you can say
Baby, how am I ever gonna fix you?
Can we go back to the ultimate?
Can never be enough
Back to the ultimate
Higher than the heights
Back to the ultimate
Feel the power light it up
Back to the ultimate
With me inside your eyes
Baby, how am I ever gonna break you?
'Cause lately I love you so much that I hate you
You cray cray driving me so insane
Baby I know that I just can't escape you
Can we go back to the ultimate? This can never be enough
Back to the ultimate, higher than the heights
Back to the ultimate, feel the power light it up
Back to the ultimate, see inside your eyes
Once we were but now we're not
Gave our best with all we got
Had it all but we got caught
Holding on to na-na-na-nothing
Can we go back to the ultimate?
It can never be enough
Back to the ultimate
Higher than the high
Back to the ultimate
Heal the power and light it up
Back to the ultimate
Me inside your eyes
Back to the ultimate
Success can never be enough
Back to the ultimate
Higher than the high
Back to the ultimate
Heal the power and light it up
Back to the ultimate
Me inside your eyes
