Stand forever, borderlines, borderlines
Don't draw outside, outside the lines, outside the lines
Keep keeping him, keep him confined, keep him confined
'Til you've driven him out of his mind
He's out of his mind
And these borderlines
That you set in place
They make him suffocate
Blew him in his face
And these borderlines
Borderlines are here to stay
Here to stay
Lock him away
Up in his room
Send him up to that room
Don't you let him
Let him get out
Anytime soon
Spin him a nasty, airtight and black and cozy cocoon
So he can curl up into a ball just like the womb
And these borderlines
That you set in place
They make him suffocate
Blew him in his face
And these borderlines
Borderlines are here to stay
Here to stay
It isn't unusual to lose your way
But it's unbearable when borders stay
I'm your hostage up in the sky
I'm inside a plane
Time moves backwards
Blocking the pathway
To winning this game
And these borderlines
That you set in place
They make him suffocate
Blew him in his face
And these borderlines
Borderlines are here to stay
He'll stay
