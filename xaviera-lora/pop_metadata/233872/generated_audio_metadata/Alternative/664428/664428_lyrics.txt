All I wanna do right now is get on down with you or anybody in my sight
It's not that I don't believe in love, it's just a matter of the back of my mind
Those are not the words you were looking for
And these are not the things you need
It seems my heart has closed its door
And God knows where the hell I put the key
Don't tell me those three words
all you're gonna get is one
And if I could I would, I would say them back
But it looks like the cat caught my tongue
Those are not the words you were looking for
These are not the things you need
It seems my heart has closed its door
And God knows where the hell I put the key
All my bills are paid now I just gotta get laid
All my bills are paid tonight
All my bills are paid, now I just gotta get laid
All my bills are paid tonight
You're pretty damn pretty for a girl
But you're not the most beautiful girl I've ever seen
Yeah, I think you're quite nice
Yeah, I think you're alright
But you're just not the girl of my dreams
Those are not the words you were looking for
These are not the things you need
It seems my heart has closed its door
And God knows where the hell I put the key
The sun reflects in your eyes like golden laser dynamite
And when you cry it's like the oceans open wide
And a new day dawns on earth tonight
Were those the words you were looking for
Are they the ones you need
Romance is dead and you're feeling sore
Hollywood will set you free
Those are not the words you were looking for
And these are not the things you need
It seems my heart has closed its door
And God knows where the hell I put the key
