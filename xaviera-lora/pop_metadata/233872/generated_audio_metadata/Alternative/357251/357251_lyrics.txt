Live your life while you can
Kiss the sun but you kill the man
Everywhere that you look is a life worth living, babe
This is what we're to do
Till we feel something new
And you work your jobs, earn your pay
We're the band and we're here to play
Realize, oh, tell the day, oh
Realize, oh, tell the day, oh
Leave me here to change the world
What's that sound? Where are we?
What in the world have we wanted this to be?
But you clench your fists for the fight
Strike a match, wanna dance in the light
So if this is it, so if this is all
Just change the plan and you change the song
All the world is a stage
We're the band and we're here to play
Leave the night on, dead day off
Leave the night on, leave me here to take the world
What have you done, man?
What have you done, man?
Turn the day off
Leave the night on
Leave me here to save the world
Feeling night on, daylight day off
Feeling night on, leave me here to change the world
