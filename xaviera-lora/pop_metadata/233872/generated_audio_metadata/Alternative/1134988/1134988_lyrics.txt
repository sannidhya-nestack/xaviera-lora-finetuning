Maybe the time has come to shine a little light
See we're a world away and running out of time
I want you to know my dear I did the best I could
I tried the best I could to make it right
I'm on the avenue, I'm walking to your door
Spend twenty afternoons just crawling on the floor
I want you to know my love that I'll be coming home
I'll be coming home to stay
You say
And the time is almost over
Remember what I told you when the light will shine
And the sea
Everything is done, here they come
Delivering the dawn
It's too late for me but I have a feeling you'll be fine
It's too late for yesterday but tomorrow's right on time
I want you to know my girl I did the best I could
I tried the best I could to make it right tonight
The time is almost over
Remember what I told you in the light
Will shine
And they see the burning sun
Where everything is done
Here they come
To live in the dawn
Here they come
Delivering the dawn
Here they come
Delivering the dawn
Here they come
Delivering the dawn
Here they come
Delivering the dawn
Here they come
Delivering the dawn
Here they come
Delivering the dawn
