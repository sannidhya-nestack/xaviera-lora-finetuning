Good times they will come
But if you're drowning in sorrow
Chances are that come tomorrow they won't
And peace you'll surely know
But if you're battling a demon
Then the wishes that you're dreaming won't grow
Let's et about drowning in demons
Think about living and singing
Ay ay ay ay ay ay
And we'll be dancing and dancing and dancing all around the room
You'll be dancing, dancing, dancing all around the room
You'll be dancing, dancing, dancing all around the room
You'll be dancing, dancing, dancing all around the room
And heaven surely knows
It seems that we are living but we'll always be iven, thank God
And the devil watches close
He'll sneak into your soul and he'll never let you go, then you're lost
Let's et about heavens and demons
And think about living and singing
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
And we'll be dancing, dancing, dancing all around the room
And we'll be dance, dance, dance, dancing all around the room
You'll be dancing, dancing, dancing all around the room
You'll be dancing, dancing, dancing all around the room
Sometimes I get a little lost
A little lost and it hurts sometimes
But you come around
Shake my hand
You want me dancing, dancing, dancing all around the room
You want me dance, dance, dancing, dancing all around the room
You want me dancing, dancing, dancing all around the room
You want me dancing, dancing, dancing all around the room
Yeah
Turn me on, yeah
Take me home, yeah
Take me home
You'll be dancing, dancing, dancing all around
Dancing, dancing, dancing all around
You'll be dancing, dancing, dancing all around
You'll be dancing, dancing, dancing all around
You'll be dancing, dancing, dancing all around
You'll be dancing, dancing, dancing all around
