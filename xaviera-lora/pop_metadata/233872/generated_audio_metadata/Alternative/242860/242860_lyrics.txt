My sweet sixteen
The homecoming queen
Can't go, no Chicago
Now she gets it on
Gets it on for Babylon
Hollywood
Hollywood and Holly did
The money shot
The money shot is all they want
No imagination
See it all myself you're Lord Extreme
So she found some fame and she's got a brand new name
Cause that's what you do when you play that game
I got a Polaroid without those scars
From back when we made out in her daddy's car
My debutante
She always knew what she want
Hollywood
Man made curves and locks to kill
The money shot
The money shot pays all those bills
No imagination, seen on the satellite extreme
A cold realization, the homecoming turnpike queen
She left town, gonna be a movie star
We never thought she'd take it quite that far
It made the papers, it was on TV
She was DOA at the age of twenty-three
So she found fame and she got a brand new name
that's what you do when you play that game
I got a Polaroid without those scars
From back when we made out in her daddy's car
