Mirror, mirror, mirror, I think I've lost control
There's stranger bleeding on my floor
You were next, I was young
I pulled my hair up and I softened
So you could take me, mama
I'm sitting in a van, slowly spinning
And you, blowing in my heart
The glass turned to stone
You, you, you, it's all for you
And I'm having a place out of you
You, you, you, it's all for you
And I'm having a place out of you
Here, here, here
Here, here, here
Mirror, mirror, mirror
The things I've lost control
They're meant to leak on my floor
Pre-verse, soft, soft strings pull and pull and slice right through
Soft, soft, can feel everything
You, you, you, so are you
I've found out, I did it
Sheer, sheer, sheer, sheer, sheer
You're so high, high down, down, down, down, down, down, yeah
Sheer, sheer, sheer, sheersheer
