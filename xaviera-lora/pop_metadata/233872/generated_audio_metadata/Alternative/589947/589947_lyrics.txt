Sun shining down on me
No other place I'd rather be
This old neighborhood
Makes me feel so good
Where best memories have been
This is where my heaven is gonna be
Sun shining down on me
No other friends I'd rather see
I just received a phone call
At one o'clock I'll be out playing ball
Until it gets dark around the corner down at the park
Yeah that's where I'll be
Moon glowing down on me
No other sky I'd rather see
If this old town blows up
Damn right I'd still show up
And bring it back to life
I know that old morning light
Is waiting for me
Moon glowing down on me
No other song I'd rather be
Barking with all the dogs
Until that old morning fog
Reveals the warm sunrise
In heaven this is what my eyes are gonna see
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
