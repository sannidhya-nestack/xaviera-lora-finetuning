Out of your memory
To sell the darkest seas of woe
Not that it has to be
Caught in the plasticine of woe
Lines on your face you see
Circles of grace you see, oh no
You're bringing this tragedy
Running your battery down low
Rain and the ancient sea
Fall through the cracks and we ground
Untie my shepherd's tree
Not that it has to be
Oh no
Mountains of bones you see
Are all that's left you see
Oh no
Lost in some tragedy
Running your battery down low
Running your battery
Running your battery down low
Running your battery
Running your battery down now
