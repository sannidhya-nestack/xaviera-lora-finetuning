Vapor angel, come out of the sky
Build me a house of rain
Skylights and domes
Castles and clouds
Old barman doors
All these voices come in to carry me on the breath of the wind
So colorful and I am peaceful in this light
Like a dove in the garden above the temple's gate
The roses are as deep as my lover's moon
What are these voices
Coming to carry me
On the breadth of their wing
So colorful
And I am peaceful
In its light
And my lucid dream to you
A particle of movement
Turning in your gaze
A heat reflected off the burning street
Off a live wire
What are these voices coming to carry me?
On the breath of their wing
So colorful, so colorful, yeah
I am peaceful
In this light
Ah, ah, ah
