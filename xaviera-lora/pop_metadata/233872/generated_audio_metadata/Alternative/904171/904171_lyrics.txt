Tonight
Your illuminating eyes became
Two beacons of light
And they're pulling me their way
This gaze is untangling a crooked trail
Like a compass in a map
And I'm following their lead
I feel the stars around us standing still
Are perfectly arranged to make this night
Like they were broken into scattered shards to fall
Right in place
Right into place
Your voice has been traveling a long way here
To resound in my soul
Through catacombs inside
These words are unraveling my world
The fear, hope and doubt
Too so inside your song
I feel the stars around us standing still
Are perfectly arranged to make this night
Like they were broken into scattered shards to fall right in place
Right into place
We were broken into scattered shards to fall
I'll kill it all and live through the rest of my life without you
And why could I believe in more
Than the everlasting love between you and I
I feel the stars around us standing still
Are perfectly arranged to make this night
Like they were broken into scattered shards to fall right in place
Right into place tonight
