Save them, don't save us
Save them, don't save us
Come on, come all, come see them sprawl
Come see them lining up down the hall
First on the list, can't be missed
You can't be running down brain tricks
Can you see, I want to see
I'm meant to see atrocities
This exhibition, it's got me wishing for what's finishing
Save them, don't save us
Save them, don't save us
You want us to see what you can't see
Want us to be what you can't be
But we are the misfits, how can we live like misfits?
No sense and no conscience
Can't pretend that we won't bend
You can't pretend that this won't end
Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah
Save them, don't save us
Save them, don't save us
Save them, don't save us
Save them, don't save us
Save them, don't save us
Save them, don't save us
Save them, don't save us
Save them, don't save
