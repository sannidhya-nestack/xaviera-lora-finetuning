I like the way you taste, I like the way you're burdensome
Can't we pick a better place, just like where all the cool kids go?
How can you turn it all away when I'm showing too much trade?
Do you think it's all a game?
Well, you're right, I won't delay
Let's start your world today
The only thing I'll say (got it)
Don't stop
Don't stop
Ooh, I like the way you came
I like that kind of graphic love
I will see you another day
When you're not covered in my (uh)
Ooh, you're like the burning
The sorrow running
The hands of loving
Oh, quit the stallin' and put it on me
You know I love it
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't hide, I'll make a catch like you
Cut above the rest
Don't hold it all to me like you
I'm ready for the best
Don't stop
Don't stop
