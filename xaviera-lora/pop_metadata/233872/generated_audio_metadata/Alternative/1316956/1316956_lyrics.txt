Chilling vibes got me floating in a dream so bright
Chilling vibes got me wondering about the stars tonight
It usually hits in the twilight
Where shadows start to dance about
Chilling vibes
Got me floating in a dream so bright
Chilling vibes
Got me drifting on a cloud of sand
It's moonlight, love makes the universe spin around
It usually hits in the twilight
Where the moonlight whispers soft and loud
Chilling vibes, got me floating in a dream so bright
Hold my hand, we'll ride the waves together
Where every moment feels like forever
Chilling vibes, let's get lost in the noise
Breathe it in, let it echo with voice
