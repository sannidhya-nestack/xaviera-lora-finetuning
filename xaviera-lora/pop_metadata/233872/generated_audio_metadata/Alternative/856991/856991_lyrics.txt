We live a strange and lonely life
Surrounded by friendly strangers
It seems you know me well
Yet you are vaguely familiar
You constantly remind me
Of someone I once knew
In order to find their truth
I had to lose myself
I run away, away from me to get to know you
I run away, away from me to get to know you
Do you really know me
Am I someone from your past
Now do I risk it all
And take off all of my mask
I think you'd run away
From who I really am
At times I can be the monster
Instead of just the man
I run away, away from me
To get to know you
I run away, away from me
To get to know you
I run away, away from me
To get to know you, hey
I run away, away from me
To get to know you, ah
I run away, away from me to get to know you
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I run away, away from me to get to know you
Get to know you
Get to know you (let's just run away)
Get to know you (let's just run away), get to know you
Get to know you (let's just run away, run away, let's just run away, run away)
I just run away
To get to know you
