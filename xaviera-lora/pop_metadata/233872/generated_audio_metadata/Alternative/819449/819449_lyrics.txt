I've been waiting all my life to share who I am
I've been holding on
My life's been a sham
Then you came into my life
Your love kept me
The time has come to let it all unfold
To break the bonds that hold me through your love
I rise up and sing, I'm flying now, traveling through your love
Transformed, powerful, beautiful, soaring high
I've burst into the sun for the very first time
The past behind me
My new life's just begun
Through it all
Our love is sure
Love transcends, love endures
I love you, I love you
