I am not anti-social
I spread my anarchy
All through society
But please don't take away
My MP3, I know it's just a game
When I push the needle through
Ooh, my salty lip, how's'bout a bloody kiss?
I'll play my punk rock tunes
While you watching your cartoons
With Captain Crunch
For breakfast and lunch
Tell me to find a job
With battle card and a party
I need to go downtown
And meet that chick of mine
She's got a new tattoo
And it's Snickers back at you
Killin' time
No it ain't no crime
I'm just a restless soul, lost in suburbia
I'll spread my anarchy all through society
I've got a big backyard
Why should I work too hard
If I need to see my friends
I take my mommy's beds
She thinks I'm still a boy
But I found her box of toys
Under her bed
It's stuck in my head
I'm just a restless soul lost in suburbia
I'll spread my anarchy all through society
I'm just misunderstood
Trapped in your neighborhood
You think we're all the same
You don't even know my name
