You know the saying, it goes like this
And just like your kiss, I didn't choose it
It chose me
I'm torn apart to feel like this
Never knowing if what you're telling me is straight up
Or you're telling me what I wanna hear
Right place, right time (you're in my dream)
Call it luck or by no sign (let go of me)
I've been waiting all my life for this
You're the only one I couldn't resist
I'm down to the last piece of my heart
So wait for sharing it
Take care of it, take care of it
I've been waiting all my life for you
For the moment they said wouldn't come true
I'm down to the last piece of my heart
So wait for sharing and take care of it
Take care of it
You know the feeling, it starts like this
Tiny butterflies and a fever
From my head right down to my toes
Place right time (you're in my dream)
Call it luck or by no sign (let go)
I've been waiting all my life for this (oh)
You're the only one I couldn't resist (oh)
I'm down to the last piece of my heart
So we can share it and take care of it
Take care of it
I've been waiting all my life for you (oh)
For the moment they said wouldn't come true
Oh, I'm down to the last piece of my heart
So wait for sharing and
Take care of it, take care of it
Can't eat, sleep, think, do nothing at all
Without your love I go through withdrawals
I'm crazed, lovesick, you're stuck in my head
Stuck in my head
I've been waiting all my life for this
You're the only one I couldn't resist
I'm down to the last piece of my heart
So if we're sharing it
Take care of that
Take care of that
I've been waiting all my life for you
For the moment they said wouldn't come true
I'm down to the last piece of my heart
So wait for sharing it
Take care of it
Take care of it
It's the last piece of my heart
It's the last piece of my heart
Take care of it
It's the last piece of my heart
Take care of it
Take care of it
