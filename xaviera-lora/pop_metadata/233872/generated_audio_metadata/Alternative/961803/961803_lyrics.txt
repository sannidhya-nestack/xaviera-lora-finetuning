She breaks down and releases her tension in the easiest way
She's in no doubt
If she pushes any further then
He'll beg her to stay
Can't get this storm out
From under my skin
This'll be the year for sure
That we see each other again
The most painless possible way
To leave near you
She slows down
And pretends that no one's leaving
Till she gets what she wants
He works so hard
But not to mention where he wants to go
And how he'll pass
Can't get this storm out from under my skin
This'll be the year for sure that we see each other again
The most painless possible way
To leave New York
Can't you see the words in her mind
Are you scared enough to leave us behind
Do you know
The life that you had
Are you brave enough to leave this to chance?
Can't get this storm out
From under my skin
This'll be the year for sure
That we see each other again
The most painless possible way
To leave New York
This will be the year for sure
That we see each other again
The most painless possible way
To leave New York, New York
To leave New York
