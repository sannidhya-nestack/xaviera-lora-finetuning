On days you're dazed by storms ahead
When long rain fills your mind with dread
Well time may crawl but you'll stand tall
Saying now it falls to me
On days your eyes can't look around
Ashamed of times you tripped and stayed down
Will you still crawl to standing ups?
No workout or thing now it falls to me
'Cause it's your day, and it's your day, and it's your day
And it's your day, and it's your day and it's your day
And it's your day (let it go) and it's your day (take it slow, hold that father thing you know) and it's your day baby (let it go, take it slow, hold that father thing you know)
Cause it's your day (let it go) and it's your day (take it slow, hold that father thing you know) and it's your day (let it go, take it slow, hold that father thing you know)
And if I fade to brick or stone
Some warmth remains
Because I know that it's your day
That it's your day, that it's your day, and it's your day
That it's your day, and it's your day, and it's your day
That it's your day, and it's your day, and it's your day
And it's your day, yeah, yeah, yeah
And it's your day, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And it's your day, yeah, yeah, yeah
And it's your day, yeah, yeah ,yeah
Let it go, take it slow, hold up all the things you know (let it go, take it slow, hold up all the things you know)
Let it go, take it slow, hold up all the things you know (let it go, take it slow, hold up all the things you know)
Let it go, take it slow, hold up, all the things you know (let it go, take it slow, hold up all the things you know)
And it's your day yeah yeah yeah
And it's your day, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
it's your day, yeah, yeah, yeah
And it's your day, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And it's your day, yeah, yeah, yeah
