I turn from sunlit halls where the pictures of us
Get smaller and fade
Lost smiles in those mist calls
Hit my fist on a wall
Let stone convey that there's no time
Like when there's no time
So take it while you have it
there's no time
Like when there's no time
So reach right out and grab it
Did you wish I'd offered my hand
Was I missed on the falls or rocking the waves
The chance it was mine and again
What's some space between friends
This late in the day'cause there's no time
Like when there's no time
So take it while you have it
there's no time
Like when there's no time
So reach right out and grab it
'Cause there's no time
Like when there's no time
So take it while you have it
there's no time
Like when there's no time
So reach right out and grab it
So reach right out and grab it
