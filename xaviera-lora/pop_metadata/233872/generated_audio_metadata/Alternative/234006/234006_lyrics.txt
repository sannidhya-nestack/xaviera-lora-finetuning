I remember the week, remember the hour, the day
You came into my life
Afraid of the world, afraid of you and me, the time
It just flew right by, yeah
And now the sun is setting
Are you standing on the road? (She ain't walking back)
There's no use now, she's got your number
Please start from zero
(She ain't walking back)
There's no use now, she's got your number
It's time for goodwill, girl
And we used to say nothing got in our way
The cards left undone
And mama
I'm a blown away
Now Mr. Fain is calling
And he's calling her out loud (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, walk me back)
There's no use now, she's got your number
It's time for good old
She ain't walkin' back
There's no use now, she's got your number
This time for good, oh
She ain't walkin' back
There's no use, there's no use now
This time for good, oh
And I'm standing here facing flaws
I'm sorry it won't fit on the car
Can beauty grow in this garden
Left lifeless broken and dark
I wanna raise love from the ashes
I wanna pull our hearts together
She ain't walkin' back, there's no use now, she's got your number, it's time for good, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
She ain't walkin' back, there's no use now, she's got your number, it' time for good, yeah
This time for good

She said, "Oh, is that with the, um, is that the, no, is that what?" She said, "Oh, is that, I was just in my house." She said, "Is that the current drag style?" And I go, "I don't know." I said, "No, it's what they're wearing in France these days." She said, "I'm not in France, so I went to." And I said, "Well, French bum."
