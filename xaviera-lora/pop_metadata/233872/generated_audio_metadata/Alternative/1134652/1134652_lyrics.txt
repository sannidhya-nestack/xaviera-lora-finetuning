I look out at the clear blue sky
I see miles between you and I, and I
Want to be there with you, boy
But the distance seems far too wide
I know you've been alone for too long
Your heart drifting without a home
Can't you see that I'm still beside you
While others have come and gone
Yes, I know that you care
But do you feel the way I do?
Or do you still hold out hope for someone else?
For the world can be cold
And sometimes the love around you
Is worth more than all the love you find out there
Just out in the clear blue sky
We see the moments that pass us by
Will you just let them slip away boy
Or hold them without your mind
Yes I know that you care
But do you feel the way I do
Or do you still hold out hope for someone else
For the world can be cold
And sometimes the love around you
Is worth more than all the love you find out there
All of our lives we hold on to
The dreams that we hope come true
But like a shooting star across the sky
They burn bright and fade from view
Yes I know that you care
But do you feel the way I do?
Or do you still hold out hope for someone else?
For the world can be cold
And sometimes the love around you
Is worth more than all the love you find out there
Then out of the clear blue sky
You smile and you catch my eye
