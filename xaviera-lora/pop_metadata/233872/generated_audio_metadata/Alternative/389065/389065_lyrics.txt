Every day you lay awake
Every day you lay in bed
Going places that you know
Every day you lay awake
Staying safe inside your head
Going places that you know
That you are standing in the dark
You are standing at the door
You wanna be invited
Just don't ask me who's to blame
If you're always waiting
Wanting to be invited
Just don't ask me who's to blame
You should be the one who knows
Let's take a moment for your innocence
Before you kiss, kiss, kiss it away
And you break so easy in your self defense
Well tell me who you wanna be today
You were lying in the sun
You were lying in the road
It was not ordinary
Were you lying all the time
Won't you tell me was it
Was it extraordinary
Won't you tell me what it was
You should be the one who knows
How about that moment for your innocence
Now that you kiss, kiss, kiss it away
And you break so easy in your self defense
Well, tell me who you are today, today
You were in this man, you know how it goes
You know all the details, you wore all the clothes
I am all confused, I thought you were the one who knows
Won't you tell me what it was, you should be the one who knows
Just tell me what it was
I'll be back, I'll be back, I'll be back
