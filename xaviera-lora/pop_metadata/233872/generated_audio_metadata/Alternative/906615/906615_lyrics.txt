I still remember the time when I was blind to love like that
And I still remember when I stood in silence afraid to fight back
So here I am just stuck in my misguided thoughts
And here we are 365 days later just like that
And I have to confess there wasn't a moment I don't think back
I know that the deafening silence is killing me
I'm so afraid, I'm so afraid that I won't be okay
I'm so afraid that I will be forever paralyzed by time
Now I know, now I know that it all has to happen this way
I've been this way and that's actually okay
And now all I'm left with are beautifully painful unspoken thoughts
So maybe you just take a sip and slip into ignorant bliss
But is this just another exception to I to my list
I'm so afraid, I'm so afraid that I won't be okay
I'm so afraid that I will be forever paralyzed by time
Now I know, now I know that it all has to happen this way
Happened this way
And that's actually okay
You said that I would get over this one day
How do I know that you're not just lying to me
That it is easy
You said that I would get over this one day
How do I know that you're not just lying to me
That it is easy
I'm so afraid, I'm so afraid that I won't be okay
I'm so afraid that I will be forever paralyzed by time
Now I know, now I know that it all has to happen this way
Happen this way, that's actually okay
