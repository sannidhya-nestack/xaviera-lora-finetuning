I wish I'd wake up every morning with my future in hand
The flying fish of Echo Park are just blips from my head
We're just automatic friends
We're just automatic friends
We're just automatic friends
We're just automatic friends
El Chupacabra haunts the hills here
And we live happy below
And I feel certain because I know you
You'd get a kick out of that
We're just automatic friends
We're just automatic friends
We're just automatic friends
We're just automatic friends
My good friend died of cancer last year
He withered away and then disappeared for good
So if you think you should act, then maybe you should
So we took ourselves down to Peru
To see if we could get closer to you again
On the highest mountain that I'd ever been to
We're just automatic friends
We're just automatic friends
We're just automatic friends
We're just automatic friends
