She told me to change and I felt nervous
Deep in my stomach, smoked the day away
But through the fight, what we're thinking of
Could help me fall in love
And these bones they're for you
I'm sorry for what they do
It's your choice, yeah what you do
But these bones will follow you
These bones will follow, these bones will follow
These bones will follow, these bones will follow you
These bones will follow, these bones will follow
Like ghosts who you watch across
Through the other side and the weakened hide
And I kiss your mouth
Yeah, I kiss your mouth
And problems, we had a few
I know now what not to do
What not to do
And these bones, they're for you
Sorry for what they do
It's your choice, hear what you do
But these bones will follow you
These bones will follow, these bones will follow
These bones will follow, these bones will follow you
These bones will follow, these bones will follow
Oh, oh, oh
These balls will fuck you
Sorry for what they do
It's your choice here what you do
But these balls will follow you
These balls will follow
These balls will follow
These balls will follow
These balls will follow you
These balls will follow
These balls will follow
