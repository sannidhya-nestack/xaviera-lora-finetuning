A beautiful day, a beautiful girl
All I can say is I'm loving this world we're living in
Loving this world we're living in
But we got all day with nothing to do
I'm just so glad to be sharing it with you
I'm loving this world, loving this world we're living in
So baby put down your phone
Or better yet just leave it at home
We'll focus on me and you
Like we're supposed to do
'Cause you make this the best day of my life
I've never felt this so alive
As long as you're here by my side
I'm loving this world
This feels like the way it ought to be
Endless possibilities
As long as you are here with me
I'm loving this world that we're living in
I'll say the things I've been meaning to say
I won't let my work or the fellas get in the way
I'm loving this world, loving this world we're living in
So baby put down your phone
Or better yet just leave it at home
We'll focus on me and you
Like we're supposed to do
You make this the best day of my life
I've never felt this so alive
As long as you're here by my side
I'm loving this world
This feels like the way it ought to be
Endless possibilities
As long as you are here with me
I'm loving this world that we're living in
You make this the best day of my life
I've never felt this so alive
As long as you're here by my side
I'm loving this world
This feels like the way it ought to be
Endless possibilities
As long as you are here with me
I'm loving this world, yes I am, I'm loving this world
I'm loving this world that we're living in
