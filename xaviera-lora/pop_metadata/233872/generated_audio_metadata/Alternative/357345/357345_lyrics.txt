Oh we don't stop don't drop until the sun comes up
For fun, just for fun, you don't know what it is exactly that you've done to me
Grind away my gears, all I can hear in my ears is a dry heart
And then the doctor calls it love
Son, it must be love
Don't call it love, no, anything but love
How could this be love, how could this be
If I share a line, would you stay with me forever through the night?
Drag me through your streets, your counties, until I bang at your heels
How can this be love?
Can this be love?
Don't call it love
Don't call it love
Don't call it love
It's only love
Don't call it love
Don't call me
We don't stop, we don't drop'Til the sun comes up
We don't stop, we don't drop And we don't call it love
Come and tell me you love me
