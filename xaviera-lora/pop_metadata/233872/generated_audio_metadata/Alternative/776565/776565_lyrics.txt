Lots of people look at me
Seeing what I think they see
The center of the universe
A billion places all at once
I'll be up there
A mouse and goose in here
We'll find the time to know the world out there
At peace we'll find a place in everyone
A mess you're filled with someone else's fun
Pretty blue
Skies in my hair
Freedom straps me to my bed
A candy coated pigtail girl
She cries'cause she wants the front seat
I've been up there, a mouse in missing hair
We'll find the time to know that we're not there
At peace, we'll find a place in everyone
And mess your filth with someone else's fun
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Looking through a tinted glass
Makes this world a better place
I'm not by where I want to go
But underneath the same old verse
Heartbeat, oh bear, oh my sim isn't here
Well it's fine, it's time to know the word I bear
At least we'll find a place in everyone
Unless you're filled with someone else's fault
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-ooh-woah
Woah-oh-oh-oh-ooh-woah
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh whoa
