You weren't trying
But you weren't supposed to
You weren't sleeping
Were you really?
You were ignoring
Everything I told you ever
But I'm not willing to wait any longer
And I was awake for most of this
So please don't touch me God
You keep on pretending this is it
But I've been much closer before
If this has happened before
'Cause I don't know anymore
You weren't complying
I govern your decisions gladly
You called for an army
And I walk you home
And I was awake for most of it
Said please don't touch me God
You keep on pretending this is it
But I've been much closer before
If this has happened before
I don't know anymore
If this has happened before
I don't know anymore
I walk you home, you beg for torture
You call for your army, and I show them the world
