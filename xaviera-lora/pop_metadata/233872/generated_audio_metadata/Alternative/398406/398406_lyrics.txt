Well it's that time again
Feeling sorry saying when
Will I ever find it
If I look I'll never find
But if I don't I'll lose my mind
So where is it I'm going
So long, it seems to take so long
Hold on, why it has to hurt
Why it's so difficult to work
What other people doing
Is this something that I do
Well I can change, I'll be a new man, I can do it
So long, seems to take so long
Hold on, hold me high
Want you I have to believe
I've said yes all my life
I have to believe
On me, I want you, I have to believe
Well it's that time again
Feeling sorry, same way
Will I ever find it?
But if I look I'll never find
But if I don't I'll lose my mind
Haunt me, I want you, I have to believe
Now I'm saying yes, oh
My life I had to believe, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
