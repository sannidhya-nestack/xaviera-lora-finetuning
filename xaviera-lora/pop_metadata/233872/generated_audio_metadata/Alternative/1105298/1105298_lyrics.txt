And I can listen to humbly
Monetary as they may be
It still rubs the guilt from me
For loving you, loving you
Loving you helplessly
You know I would gladly love day and night
I knew you would take your time laughing right
You know there is hope for us after all
I knew we would hold it all through the odds
True as you are, true as you're under the sun
Going crazy, my penalty
For living the hard but willfully
Aching just for your company
Knowing you, knowing you
Knowing you're under the sun
You know I would badly love day and night
I knew you would take your time laughing right
You know there is hope for us after all
I knew we would pull it off through the ocean
As you are, true as rock under the sun
Premonitions and prophecies
Terrible cards and similes
Trapped me in your certainty
Sure as you're, sure as you're
Sure as you're under the sun
A slow build up and fast release
Sharing eyelids and churning teeth
Silky sand we lay with ease
For the love, for the love
The love of walls under the sun
You know I would gladly love day and night
I knew you would take your time loving right
You know there is hope for us after all
I knew we would pull it off through the odds
True as we are, true as we're under the sun
True as you're, true as you're
True as you're under the sun
Knowing you, knowing you
Knowing you're under the sun
For the love
For the love
The love of all's under the sun
