I hear voices singing on the hill
Like a funeral I lay quiet and still
Call it what you will I know this
Despite a doubting mind I feel this is the end
But I'm fine tonight
Let this rain wash clean all my sins
The moon is high like a lamplight murdering the dead
The end
And so am I, you see
Have you ever screamed out in the night
At the end of a night, may you cry
Falling all around you promises on fairy tale lies
And canvases of steel and bone
I'm strong tonight
Let this rain wash clean all my sins
The moon is high like love light
Burying the dead, yeah
It was sweet and so am I you see
And so am I you see
