On our backs
The sky is blue and there's nothing like the smell of you
There's no one around
Another thing to do and there's nothing like the taste
Of you
We're floating
We're flying
Naked and weightless
We're laughing
We're crying
Naked and weightless
We're needy, so greedy, naked and weightless
And I'll dream of you
We can talk
Though we don't have to there's nothing like the sound of you
So take my hand and I'll follow you
Cause there's nothing just like walking back with you
We're floating, we're flying, naked and weightless
We're needy, so greedy
Naked and weightless
We're laughing, we're crying
Naked and weightless
We're floating, we're flying
Naked and weightless
And I'll dream of you
