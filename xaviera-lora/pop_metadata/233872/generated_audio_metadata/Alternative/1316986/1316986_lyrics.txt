Why did I turn left, darling?
Was it fate's design?
The glow of streetlights shining
Illuminates your smile
Every twist and turn there I
I trace the lines that bind us
In the silence, softly pondering
If I made the right choice, I wonder
Hold me close, don't let go
In this moment let it flow
Every doubt fades away now
As we dance through time somehow
Waves of thoughts crashing, memories unfurl
Echoes of your laughter, dancing like a swirl
In this maze we wander, finding paths to new life
In the shadows whispers linger, guiding dreams into the night
Hold me close, don't let go in this moment let it flow every doubt fades away now as we dance through time somehow
Lost in the echoes of you, these streets hold secrets too
Every choice a threat where we be
In the tapestry of believing
Hold me close, don't let go
In this moment let it flow
Every doubt fades away now
As we dance through time somehow
