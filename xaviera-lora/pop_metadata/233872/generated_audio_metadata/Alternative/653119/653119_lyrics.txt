Death has a smile, it's yours
Fine walking end of the world
Blasphemous and holy fire
The danger is the desire
Your lips, your lips, your apocalypse
Kiss, kill, kill, kiss (kiss)
Your lips, your lips, your apocalypse
Let's burn the world tonight, yeah
Tied to your all to will and sacrifice
Last wish is private knife
Rain your voodoo down on me
Let the skies fall over me
Your lips, your lips, your apocalypse
Kiss, kill, kill, kiss, yeah
Your lips, your lips, your apocalypse
Let's burn the world tonight, yeah
The end is night they say (they say)
Drop to your knees and pray (and pray)
I knew God on His way (on His way)
Drop to my knees and
Pray, bring on the apocalypse, I want his apocalypse, I need his apocalypse, I need your lips, your lips, your apocalypse
Kiss, kill, kill, kiss, yeah
Your lips, your lips, your apocalypse
Let's burn the world tonight, yeah
