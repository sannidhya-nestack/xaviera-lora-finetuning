In a land of dreams it's always night stream
Of consciousness which seems like a moonlight beam
Amazing glow
Amazing glow
Beyond everything
Beyond every now
In a land of twilight, it's always like a false sight
Their voyants which can light
Like a ray of sun bright
Amazing glow
Amazing glow
Beyond everything
Beyond every now
