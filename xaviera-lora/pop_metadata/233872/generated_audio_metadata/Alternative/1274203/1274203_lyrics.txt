Some will gaze at stars, Neptune and Mars
Some will hang the moon, some will get a friend
To help them in hate when it's love nobody's immune
Thinking of you (Neptune and Mars, Neptune and Mars)
Can't help thinking of you
Thinking of you (Neptune and Mars, Neptune and Mars)
Can't help thinking of you (Neptune and Mars, Neptune and Mars)
Of you (Stuck in between Neptune and Mars)
Hard to find a heart without a scar
Time won't take it's toll
But we found a way to keep our blues at bay
You're the best dream of my soul
Thinking of you (Neptune and Mars, Neptune and Mars)
Can't help thinking of you
Thinking of you (Neptune and Mars, Neptune and Mars)
Can't help thinking of you (Neptune and Mars)
I don't have to matter to anyone
Long as I matter to someone
And that someone is you, guess you knew
Cause I don't hide it too well
You always will be the one for me
You flip the coin in my wishing well
Thinking of you
Can't help thinking of you
Thinking of you (Neptune and Mars)
Neptune and Mars
Can't help thinking of you
Can't help thinking of you (Neptune in Mars, Neptune in Mars)
Of you (Don't need a lifeline in between Neptune and Mars)
