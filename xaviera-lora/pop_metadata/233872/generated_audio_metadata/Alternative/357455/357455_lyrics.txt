Caught up in the clatter of a restless mind
It was mind over matter and it took some time
Was it spill or no one? I thought you would care
When it came a-talkin' there was no one there
I'd like to find my way out to help you be
If love is like an open door that sets you free
The night can be your outside from the world you know
But you're trapped inside with nowhere to go
Don't leave me standing here
Stay for a while
My hands are trembling
Run away from this world tonight
Don't leave me standing here
Stay for a while
My hands are trembling
Run away from this world tonight (tonight)
Tonight, tonight, tonight
