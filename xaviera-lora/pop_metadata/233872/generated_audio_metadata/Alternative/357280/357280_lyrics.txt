The reflections passing over
The story that I shoulder
On my disover heating
I cannot open all the vents
A race to troubled waters
A place within close quarters
I scramble to reach the heart shell
That is taking orders
Last night on the weekend
As important as you should feel
Last night on the weekend
When you're talking to me
Hang on to your headlights stuck in the grounds
My head starts to spin as the world's coming down
Last night on the weekend
As important as you should feel
Last night on the weekend
When you're talking to me
Description unrealistic
Prescription pessimistic
The words don't seem to get along
Polarizing every phrase
Trapped so potent it may
Release itself on some day
But until then I'll sit and wait
Going through the etiquette
Last night on the weekend, as important as you should feel
Last night on the weekend, when you're talking to me
Hang on to your headlights, stuck in the grounds
My head starts to spin as the world's coming down
Last night on the weekend
As important as you should feel
Last night on the weekend
When you're talking to me
Hang on to your headlights stuck in the ground
My head starts to spin as the world's coming down
I can't seem to locate where to dance
Wrapped up in a lock I'll never dance
