I've had something on my mind
And it could take a whole damn lifetime
Just to accept the weight of it all
And the cut runs deep and it hurts like hell
And in it there's my story to tell
Am I on my own?
Set to feel this pain all alone?
Hurts like this never go away
I just carry on another day
And I'm unbreakable, unbreakable, unbreakable
I get stuck sometimes I find
Trying to leave this baggage behind
And I'm breaking down these walls
It's what I have to do after all
Because these hurts have made me
Unbreakable
Am I on my own?
Set to feel this pain all alone
Hurts like this never go away
I just carry on another day
And I'm unbreakable, unbreakable, unbreakable
I could try to run, I could try to run
I could try to run but it would find me
And I could try to run, I could try to run
I could try to run but it would
Find me and I could try to run, I could try to run, I could try to run but it would
Find me and I could try to run, I could try to run, I could try to run but it would
Am I on my own?
Set to feel this pain all alone
Hurts like this never go away
I just carry on another day
And I'm unbreakable, unbreakable, unbreakable
