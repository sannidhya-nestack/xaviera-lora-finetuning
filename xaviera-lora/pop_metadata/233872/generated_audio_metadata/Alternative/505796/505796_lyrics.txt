And we hold the power here of a new day
You're stuck in the same fool once again
Take to the streets, turn out the lights
Don't let the feeling die tonight
Honey, it's all that we have
Get up, get out, get up
I'm trying to stand on the new ground
Get up, get out, get up
I can't take anymore
Get up, get out, get up
I'm trying to stand on the new ground, honey
it's all we have
You've gotta find a way to vent this frustration
You're talking and talking me circles around yourself
Straight from the heart, put up the fight
Don't let them down tonight
You know honey, you live and you learn
Get up, get up, get up
I'm trying to stand on the new ground
Get up, get up, get up, I can't take anymore
Get up, get up, get up, I'm trying to stand on the new ground, honey
it's all we have
We're trying to stand on the new ground
I can't take anymore
We're just in on the new ground
I can't take anymore
What's at the stand of the new ground
I can't take anymore
