I can't explain the many ways
How your love became my faith
And how you warmed up that winter's cold
We melted slowly into our own
Through countless places that we've known
On a whispering wind
The spring is gone
Summer rain comes down
Let's dance to the sound of drops to the ground
All we need is our love
That bright sun is overrated
In the sky that we are
In the sky that we ramble
In the sky that we ramble
Every day is wondering what we'll find
The fire we keep is close behind
A new piece of you and me to grow
Every night will bring us a new light
New friends we meet will say goodbye
So the fall will come
With a chill for no weakness
Summer rain comes down
Let's dance to the sound
That drops to the ground
All we need is our love
That bright sun is overraying
In the sky that we are
In the sky that we remember
In the sky that we are
In the sky that we are
In the sky that we are
In the sky that we are
