I like what you bet, I'm a gamblin' man
I'll get ahead any way I can
You called my bluff, I tipped my hand
I know I've lost, you win again
Well let's go double, oh nothin' at all
Let's roll the dice and let those chips fall
With a little bit of luck
And it moved you too
Someday I'll know
The spread on you
And until that day
Could just fight for ten
I've just lost you in a game
Could you give me a little credit, I'll pay you back
With a little bit of interest, when I get the knife
So shot for the dead
Cut me in, spin the wheel
I'll say when my luck will change
And then I won't have to say you in again
I won't have to say you in again
