I know not what I should say
I haven't got a clue
It's pitch dark and I can't follow you
I know not what I should think
My options are so few
It's pitch dark and what you say is untrue
I'll keep holding on
You'll keep moving on
Amidst this decay
Hear me calling
I am falling
Can you feel it in the air?
I'm ill prepared
I know not, nor do you
What you may say or do
In the deepest, darkest blue
With no sunlight shining through
I'll keep holding on
You'll keep moving on
Never enter the frame
Hear me calling
I am falling
Can you feel it in the air?
I'm ill prepared
As I lay me down to sleep
I lay awake so I don't weep
And I know that life's not fair
It's not my fault I'm ill prepared
Hear me calling, I am falling
Can you feel it in the air?
Hear me calling, I am falling
Can you feel it in the air?
