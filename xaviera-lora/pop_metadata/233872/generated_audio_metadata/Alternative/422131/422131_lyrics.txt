I don't have to write a song about nothing
I don't have to write about feeling blue
I don't have to write a song about nothing
Except sitting here thinking thoughts of you
It's you
I'm thinking about you
It's you
I'm thinking about you, yeah
Thousand stories in the world to tell
Thousand stories about heaven and hell
Thousand stories dancing around in my head
But I'm thinking about the one I love instead
It's you
I'm thinking about you
It's you
I'm thinking about you, yeah
I don't have to write a song about nothing
I don't have to write about feeling blue
I don't have to write a song about nothing
sitting here thinking thoughts of you
It's you
I'm thinking'bout you
It's you
I'm thinking'bout you
