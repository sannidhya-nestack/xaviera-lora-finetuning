Did you ever feel something that you swore was real?
Looking back maybe you were in a trance
Did you ever try to win the light in someone's eye?
Though you knew you didn't have a chance
We'll hang on to your wildest dreams
Shake that purple tambourine
Hang on even when it seems
Your dream will not survive
If your only goal is hanging on to your pilgrim soul
Then let it keep on shining like a midnight sun
Did you ever dick someone?
Did you ever need someone?
Did you ever love someone for no reason?
Pilgrim soul, pilgrim soul, pilgrim soul
Did you ever try to swim back to the other side
Of a bridge you never meant to burn
Did you ever try
To learn from your mistakes but fine
The lessons just too hard to learn
We'll hang on to your wildest dream
Shake that purple tambourine
Hang on even when it seems
Your dream will not survive
If your only goal is hanging on to your pilgrim soul
Then let it keep on shining like a midnight sun
Did you ever dick someone?
Did you ever need someone?
Did you ever love someone for no reason?
Pilgrim soul
Pilgrim soul
Pilgrim soul
Pilgrim soul
Pilgrim soul
Pilgrim soul
