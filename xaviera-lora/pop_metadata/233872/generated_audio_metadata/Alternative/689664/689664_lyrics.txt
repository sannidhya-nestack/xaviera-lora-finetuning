Do what you're told, fall into place
Try to fit in, keep the dirt off your face
Don't ask what the truth is, believe all the lies
Do what you're told, fall into place
Try to fit in, keep the dirt off your face
Don't ask what the truth is
We are not cogs inside machines
Broken dreams, broken dreams
We are not pawns in jealous games
Without names, without names
Change is coming
Systems fail
Our daughters and sons
Daughters and sons
Gifts and treasures
Change will come
Through daughters and sons
Daughters and sons
Don't live the corporate fantasy
Worker bee, worker bee
Don't be a ball of plasticine
Gelatine figurine
Change is coming
Systems filled with daughters and sons
Daughters and sons
Gifts and treasures
Change will come through daughters and sons
Daughters and sons
Do what you're told, fall ends in place
Try to fit in, keep the dirt off your face
Don't ask what the truth is, believe all the lies
They give you that paycheck to buy what you sold
They treat you like silver, you're made out of gold
They give you more homework, they steal all your time
Do what you're told, fall into place
Try to fit in, keep the dirt off your face
Don't ask what the truth is, believe all the lies
Don't ask what the truth is, believe all the lies
Don't ask what the truth is
