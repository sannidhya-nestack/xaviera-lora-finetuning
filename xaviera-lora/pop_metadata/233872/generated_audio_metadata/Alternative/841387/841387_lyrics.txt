Punch my keys, punch, punch my keys
Key punch operator, help me please
All of my circuits are on overload
Won't you change my program to another mode
Now punch my keys, punch, punch my keys
Key punch operator, help me please
Feed the information to my memory
And surely I could make on some mental relief
Punch my keys, punch, punch my keys
Key punch operator, help me please
They say that I'm incapable of making mistakes
Can't you see that I'm just human for heaven's sakes
