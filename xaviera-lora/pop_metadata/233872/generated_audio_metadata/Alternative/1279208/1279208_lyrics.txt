It's on the way
As to code
It's all I need to walk away
Yeah, your head's head, you know
You know the horses never fade
It's all insane, it's all a game
It's everywhere, the secret dream
Yeah, you're in my criminal world
You live your life in happy chains
Do it again
It's always bound, buried scroll
They hide the noses underground
Yeah, yeah, I breathe daylight
I drink the truth my leader found
I did the research, I did the research, I did the research
I did the research, I did the research ,I did the research
I did the research, I did the research, I did the research
I did the research, I did the research, I did the research
I did the research, I did the research, I did the research
