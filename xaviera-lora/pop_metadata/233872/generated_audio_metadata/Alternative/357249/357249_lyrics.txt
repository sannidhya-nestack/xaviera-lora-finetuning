How high are the dreams that you dream of that boy?
Everyone is so afraid to love
How long will this traffic last tonight, dear?
Everyone is so afraid to love
How long will we go for sex tonight, babe?
Everyone is so afraid
Everyone is screaming love
Don't need me, I am nothing but a boy so afraid to love you
Not need you, I could bleed you and still I hunger for your love
How sick are the things that we read about now
Everyone is so afraid to love
How low, how low this world
Everyone is so afraid
Everyone is screaming
Love me, don't need me
I am nothing but a boy
So afraid to love you
Not me
I could bleed you, I could bleed you
And still, I'd hunger for your love (your love, your love, your love, your love, your love)
Hunger for your love
Hunger for your love
Hunger for your love
And everyone is screaming love me
Don't need me
I am nothing but a boy so afraid to love you
Not need you
I could bleed you every day every night and love you
Every day, every night, every day, every night, every day, every night
Hunger for your love, hunger for your love
Hunger for your love
