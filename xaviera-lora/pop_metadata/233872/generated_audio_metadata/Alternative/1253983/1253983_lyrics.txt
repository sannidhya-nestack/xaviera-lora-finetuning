Dark as hell
Girl, I think you'd curse
Your evil little self
I'll try to put you in the past
I'm feeling just a bit unwell
Let's make it go faster
Who can outlast her?
Who can live forever?
Never die if you're prepared
Skin shedding
Heavy pain
It's an amazing night for a dark black wedding
Dark black way
Oh well, well
Listen to your dress
Are you going to confess?
You think you're really ready for a dark black way
It lays since in my boots
The dark and evil roots
My appetite is spreading for a dark black way
Skin shedding
Heavy padding
It's an amazing night for a dark black wedding
Skin shade
Heavy padding
It's an amazing night for a dark black wedding
Blood is on the lace of the wedding dress you wear
A cold and ghostly face beneath your black raven hair
Silent yet so loud
The vowels now recite
The friends and highs deep
As we revel in the night
Sex again
Shedding heavy headache
It's an amazing night for a dark black way
Face the night, the darkness reigns, our love ignites
A sweet disdain with every kiss, a silent scream
And in the dark where you live the dream
Do you hear the silence scream?
It's a dark black love, it's never what it seems
It's a dark black way
A dark black way
(Woo)
