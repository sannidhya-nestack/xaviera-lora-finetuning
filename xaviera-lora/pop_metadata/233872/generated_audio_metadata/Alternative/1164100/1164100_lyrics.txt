You wanna break me down
Then take me back to bed
Leave me tossed around
From what was never said
I know you're acting so cool
Oh, let me do it right
Don't wanna be another fool
Too late you took your bite
She's gonna break me down
You got me hit to this
You got me right here
If I blew a kiss
I'd eat you right there
I know you acting so cruel
Oh, ain't doing right
Don't wanna be another fool
Too late, you took your bite
Baby, can you count me in?
I'm standing on shallow ground
She's gonna break me down
She's gonna break me down
Her favorite dish is sweet
To cure my appetite
You know she talks it so clean
Oh, what you do, she won't be mad
I know you actin' so a fool
Oh, and you're doin' it right
I don't wanna be another fool
But it seems you never doin' it right
She's gone break me down
She's gonna break me down
She's gonna break me down
She's gonna break my heart
