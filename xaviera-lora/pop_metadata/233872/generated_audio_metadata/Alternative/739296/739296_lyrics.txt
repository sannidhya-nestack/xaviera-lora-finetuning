I was walking round your busy streets last night
There's nothing else I'd rather do
Some think I'm crazy, or pretending that I'm lazy
Just hanging round your streets last night
I never ever want to leave you in this way
We're having fun just you and I
It's just my parents and a couple of my friends
Who want this love affair to end
I'm in love with this old town (ooh, ooh, ooh, New York)
And I just wanna hang around (ooh, ooh, ooh, New York)
And to have nothing on my mind
Just you and a good time
So I don't wanna say goodbye to you my friend
I wanna stay for one more night
I'm not pretending to be lazy or just crazy
Love hanging round your streets at night
I never ever want to leave you for a day
We're having fun hope you agree
And I don't care or mind what other people say
I'm gonna stay another day
Ooh, New York
I'm in love with this old town
Ooh, New York
And I'm gonna hang around
Ooh, New York
And to have nothing on my mind
Just you and a good time
I'm in love with this old town
And I just wanna hang around
And if nothing on my mind gets to you, then hey, good time
