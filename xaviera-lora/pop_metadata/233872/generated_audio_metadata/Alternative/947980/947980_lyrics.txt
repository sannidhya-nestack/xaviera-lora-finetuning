Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
She's a crow queen
A restless dame
Even the dark lord would not speak her name
Every time a little different
So you cannot predict when she is coming home
To a home she won't recognize
And when you look in her eye you see it's falling from the skies
Oh, I know with some grace and a little luck I'll be fine
I'll be fine, yeah
Oh, I know we all wanted to leave something behind
But she plays a patient game
We are just borrowing, borrowing
Call in the clouds so that she can make it rain
Wash away your tiny castle, don't you feel like an asshole?
We threw big strong beams, ripped out with such ease
Yeah, you never saw it coming, but in hindsight that was dumb
deep down, deep down, you know someday
Deep down, deep down, we all gon' pay out of the ground
She comes a-rumblin', turnin' it up
Break up the rockets, take the dirt back, suckers
Oh, I know with some grace and a little luck I'll be fine
I'll be fine, yeah
Oh, I know we all wanted to leave something behind
But she plays a patient game
We are just borrowing, borrowing
Mmmmmmmm
Mmmmmmmm
Mmmmmmmm
She's a cruel queen
