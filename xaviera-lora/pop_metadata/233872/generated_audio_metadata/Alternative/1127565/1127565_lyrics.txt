I love you staring into space, hoping to replace all of things in life, keeping them satisfied
Staring into time, knowing she's the final goddess on this earth, walking on the dirt
How could you walk away?
I'll keep her hooked, keep her booked, I'll keep her so she never looks
And another one night (I am the one who lied, I am the one who cried, I am the one who died)
I know your secrets, got a little secret, yeah
I know your secrets, got a little secret
Let's make this human day
It's enough to get lost in thought
Creating drama in the fantasy that you bought
That's where I belong in your mind
Lingering behind, do you even know how to find
Does she know what you do when you close the door
Does she know how you left her behind so unkind
You can't remember why
We killed each other, you played it your way
I know your secrets, got a little secret, yeah
I know your secrets, got a little secret
Got a little secret
I know your secrets, got a little secret, yeah
I know your secrets, got a little secret
I know your secret, got a little secret, yeah
Got a little secret, yeah
