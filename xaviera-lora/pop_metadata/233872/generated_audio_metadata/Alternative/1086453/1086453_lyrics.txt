I've got to get out of here
I have to run
Grapple up the muddy bank
Amidst the urgent splatter of cavalry hooves
And all I can hear is my heartbeat
And my breath out of place out of time
The panic of a lonely retreat
Run for your life, dear, run for your life
I'm the corpse in the hole of a sunken ship
The sunken ship of your soul
I'm the corpse in the hole of a sunken ship
The sunken ship of your soul
Forest of creaking bones
A choir of fists from an army of words
And when the bell broke it broke upon me
My bloodied mouth and love smothered in mold
I'm a leather faced lover so I pull the trigger
I'm a leather faced lover so I pull the trigger
I'm a leather faced lover so I pull the trigger
How my sails collapse
A flock of white canvas laughing at me
I spit unrequitance at you
I spit unrequitance at you
I spit unrequitance at you
I'm the corpse in the hull of a sunken ship
The sunken ship of your soul
I'm the corpse in the hull of a sunken ship
The sunken ship of your soul
I'm a never-fights lover so I pull the trigger
Yeah, I'll even help you tie the rope around my neck
String me by my ankles and play my face
Skin me to death, skin me to death
I'm a leather face lover so I pull the trigger, yeah
I'll even have me tie the rope around my neck
String me by my ankles and play my face
Skin me to death, skin me to death
I'm the corpse in the hall of a sunken ship
The sunken ship of your soul
I'm the corpse in the world, I'm a suckin' shit
The suckin' shit, oh god, it's all wrong
Sunken ship of your soul, sunken ship of your soul, sunken ship of your soul, sunken ship of your soul, sunken ship of your soul
