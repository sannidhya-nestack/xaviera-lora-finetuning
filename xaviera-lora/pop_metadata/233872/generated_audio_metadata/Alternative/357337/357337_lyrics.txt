Hey
I know your name
Haven't I seen you down here once before?
Last Friday night
And the jeans that you wore were tight
And so long was I
I've been out drinking with the boys all night
Just like I always do
To get through to you
Isn't the easiest thing I could do (I like you too)
So here I sit and there you smile
Why don't you stay with me tonight?
Ba-ba, ba-ba, oh well
So every other night
Bye bye, bye bye, oh I can dream about tonight
Bye bye, bye bye, why don't you stay with me tonight
Bye bye, bye bye, oh wow
Well I've got to say
You blew me away
I'll mess it up with all the things I say
Just like I always do
To get through to you
Isn't the easiest thing I could do
So here I sit, and there you smile
Why don't you stay with me tonight?
Ba-ba, ba-ba, oh wow, so every other night
Ba-ba, ba-ba, oh I can dream about tonight
Ba-ba, ba-ba, why don't you stay with me tonight?
Ba-ba
Ba-ba-oh wow
Why don't you stay with me tonight
Ba-bam, ba-bam
Why don't you stay with me tonight
Ba-bam, ba-bam
Oh, how's the weather the other night
Ba-bam, ba-bam
Oh, I can dream about tonight
Ba-ba, ba-ba, why don't you stay with me tonight?
Ba-ba, ba-ba, wow yeah
Why don't you stay with me tonight?
Ba-ba, ba-ba, oh wow
