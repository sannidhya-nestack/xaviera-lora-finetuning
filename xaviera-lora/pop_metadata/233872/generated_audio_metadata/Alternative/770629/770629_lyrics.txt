It's getting late now
And I can feel the frost
It's getting dark now
We might get lost
She says she's cold
Which gives me the opportunity
To be a gentleman
And sacrifice my coat to see
How much longer the sleeves can be
Than what typically fits well on me
You see
I don't know if I can give you what you need
But I'm offering everything
And if you need the warmth you can hold on to me
Hold on to me
She said it's cold outside
So let's go back and light a fire
And we can dance to keep ourselves warm
In front of the fireplace
Just like you always dreamed you would
Just like you always dreamed you would
I don't know if I can give you what you need
But I'm offering everything
And if you need the warmth
You can hold on to me
Hold on to me
Don't wait for tomorrow
To pick up where we left off
It's so far away
And if you need the warmth
You can hold on to me
Hold on to me
And if you need the warmth
You can hold on to me
Hold on to me
