Stuck a hood up in green blanket
You cast me to the sea
Sunlight peeks through
The tiny holes were made in them
I might get out, but only if it's safe
I might get out, but only if it's safe
I might get out, but only if it's safe
It's lonely while shaving and having coffee all at the same time
One day you were shaving your coffee
Times up you said, right on me, right around the heart
Did you find your voice that's all just like you?
Being human
But yeah, they abused and destroyed it all
And underneath my grey blankets
Can't be healed for seconds ever since
They touched my blade
Just like you're falling to the floor
Just like you being you
The elevator music just roll it over
Yeah just roll it over
I need my great blankets
Look up to the silhouette moon
Don't need no grey no more
Don't need no grey no more
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't let it go
Don't need no grey no more
It's like you're being you
We're the guests in transit
Maybe if you were to come back
We could go
For some ice skating in the desert
Just let your voice echo
Skate with me through the desert
Grave hangers in transit
Escape with me
Grave hangers in transit
