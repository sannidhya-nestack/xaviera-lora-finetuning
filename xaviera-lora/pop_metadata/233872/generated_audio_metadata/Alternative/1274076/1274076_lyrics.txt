That's got a sweet tooth, boy, I am like you
A taste for adventure and a hunger to pursue
The thrill of the chase, the rush of the unknown
Animals just waiting to make you shake and moan
Do you want a lollipop, mister?
A taste of the poopin' and a sweetness to savor and share
Do you want a lollipop mister?
Sugary seduction that'll leave you begging
For lollipop affair
My lips are sweet candy
My kiss is a delight
I'll wrap you in my arms and make everything alright
I'll be your sweet surrender, your tasty little sin
And to dinner we'll indulge in the sweetness within
Do you want a lollipop, mister?
A taste of liquorine and the sweetness to savour and share
Do you want a lollipop, mister
A sugary seduction that'll leave you begging for a lollipop affair
Let's play it out, taste the lollipop, lick it so hot, hot
Taste the sweetness, baby show me, show me what you got
Let's play a game, a sweet seduction, a tantalizing tango
With no illusion
Our love is a sugary sin
And we'll savor every moment
Oh baby, where have you been?
I feel you on a lollipop mister
A taste of the forfeit and a sweetness to savour and share
Do you want a lollipop mister?
A sugary seduction that'll leave you begging for more
So come and take a lick of my sweet delight
Endless indulgence and pleasure of this sweet, sweet night
Do you want to love me for this?
Start up and let love be the sweetness
That we can't resist
That we can't resist
That we can't resist
