I got depressed again
I told my best friend
He said I feel the same
Are we just where we started again?
I know
That it's on me
I can feel you on me
I'm onto you
I feel like you want me under you
I can feel you on me
I'm onto you
I feel like you want me under you
I made a little break away from the news today
I think it all myself, I know
That it's on me
I made a little break away from the news today
I just can't help myself, I know
That it's beyond me
I can feel you on me, I'm not like you
I feel like you want me under you
I can feel you on me, I'm onto you
I feel like you want me under you
I played this moment over and over and over again
I played this moment over and over and over
I played this moment over and over and over again
I played this moment over and over and over
I can feel you on me
I'm onto you
I feel like you want me under you
I can feel you on me
I'm onto you
I feel like you want me under you
I feel you control me
I'm not like you
I feel like you want me and love you
