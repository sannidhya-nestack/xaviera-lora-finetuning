Sixty-five life
My soul will rise
And now it must be
My turn to die
Remember bright days
A warm starry night
I won't feel no pain
Please mama don't cry
Shout out tomorrow
Smile out yesterday
Can't hear the wind crying calling my name
When the hour arrives
I walked that last mile
I spoke my last words
And said my goodbyes
Now I won't be afraid
And God knows I've tried
I take my last breath
The sun shines so bright
Shine on tomorrow
Smile on yesterday
Can't hear the wind cryin' callin' my name
Shine tomorrow, smile yesterday
Can't hear the wind cryin' callin my name
