The girl is on the radio again
I wish that I could remember that girl's name
Oh no, escapes me once again
She sang a song from 1983
Before I let life settle over me, yeah
I'll let it settle over me
Oh, oh, what am I dreaming for?
The rain beats against my door
Oh no, my beautiful cellar door
But in the pub in the cellar by the statue of the fella
Who thinks he's lost at sea
I'll sip and drink about a time when fame will be mine
And she'll be drinking about me
I drink so I can't feel my feelings, yeah
I drink so I can't feel my feelings, yeah
The girl is on Radio FM
I hear the song over and over again
My friend, over and over again
The news reader on the radio, he said
The streets are flooded and Jeremy Beadle's dead
Oh no
Where did the comedy go?
Oh, what am I dreaming for?
The rain beats against my door
Oh no
My beautiful Selador
But in the coffee by the jetty
In alphabet spaghetti
She wrote the words goodbye
I sit and drink about a time when fame will be mine
And we'll be on that radio all the time
I drink so I can't feel my feelings yeah
I drink so I can't feel my feelings yeah
I drink so I can't feel my feelings yeah
I drink a sack of coffee with my feelings, yeah
My girl is on the righty-o again
