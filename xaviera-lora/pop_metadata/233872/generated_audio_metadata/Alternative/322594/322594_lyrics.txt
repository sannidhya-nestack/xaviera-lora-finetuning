This is good, this is good, I'm finally getting somewhere
There is hope for me in spite of myself
This is good, this is good, this is good, this is good
If I didn't know me better I'm not thinking I'm someone
I might be cool, I could rule
This is good, this is good, this is good, this is good
And I'm on my way to a secret place
Where the sun shines every day
There's a place, there's a time for everyone
This must be mine
Oh now this is good, this is good
This is good, this is good
This is good, this is good
Oh now this is good
Hold on knock on my door don't help me plan
You don't have the slightest clue about who I am
This is true this is true
This is true this is true
How can you help me when you can't help yourself
You don't understand it you said so yourself
This is good this is good
This is good this is good
So I'm on my way to a secret place
Where the sun shines every day
There's a place and a time for everyone
This must be mine
Oh now this is good, this is good
This is good, this is good
This is good, this is good
Oh now this is good
