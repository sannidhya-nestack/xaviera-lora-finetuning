The girls downtown are like advanced automatings
And good cocaine is still relevant here
The goths in the corner and the drunks in the bathroom
Are happy to be out'cause they got nothing to fear
And we're really nowhere
The quiet girls sing
We've been driving for so long
None of us even remember any place that we've been
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
And all good people wake up when they're ready to the scream in truth that they know nothing at all
Then some will get sick and some will keep drinking
But we're the lucky ones cause we went over the wall
Oh, and we're really nowhere
The quiet girls sing
We've been driving for so long
None of us even remember any place that we've been
Downtown, the buildings and aging youth
Trash fires, shopping carts, colds remove
Her eyes are piss yellow like the moon
They follow you wherever you might go
And we're really nowhere
The quiet girls say
We've been driving for so long
None of us even remember any place that we've been
