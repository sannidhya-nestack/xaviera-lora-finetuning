Down the river so calmly
Drifting dreams and whispering winds
A quiet night feels so warmly
Stars above where it begins
Flow under the moonlight
Dreaming in twilight, lost in the night
Floating on distant waters, time floats in gentle embrace
Shadows march like old lovers
Silent echoes find their place
Flow under the moonlight
Dreaming in twilight
Lost in the light
Hold on to what some see
Through the hush we dream
Lost in moments of fear
Where our spirit's clear
Float under the moonlight
Dreaming is my light
Lost in the light
