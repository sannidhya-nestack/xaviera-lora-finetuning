Will it phase pass me by
It reminded me of her
And everything I had
That left me in a blur
Like a dam breaking wide
It all came back to me
This lesson I ot about
Then learned so suddenly
Yeah, it came back to me, it came back to me
I got hope, I got hope to remember
Not a day, not a day of regret
I got love, I got love in the future
But today I still ain't had none yet
So wait for a call by phone that never rings
From someone I knew years ago that promised me a dream
Cause God only knows how I have held on tight
To something from the past that's been hiding out of sight
Yeah, I keep hanging on, I keep hanging on
I got hope, I got hope to remember
Not a day, not a day of regret
I got love, I got love in the future
But today I still ain't had none yet
I start to rise and then I fall back down, down, down
The more I try it seems the farther the ground's so hard to weave
And the sun's so dim
Just how many years'til I skip outside this shadow
So I sit here alone
And the phone finally rings
And the voice says so clearly
You gotta learn a couple things
You got days in your pocket
You got dreams left to write
Always remember where you are
And who's been by your side
And I'll never let up
I'll never let it go
I got hope, I got hope to remember
Not a day, not a day of regret
I got love, I got love in the future
But today I still ain't had none yet
Still ain't had none yet
Still ain't had none yet
Still ain't had none yet
