Pain and heart are mystic less instead of what I wanted to say
But I will never say it
And nobody knows what I'm feeling inside
I need to fix myself and not be so sad
Every time I hear voices in my head
And I can't stop thinking that I'm insane
I know everything lies on the surface
I'm pretending to admit to myself that I'm fooled
I'm still trying to find my own courage
And live without lies, only you and I
I know everything lies on the surface
I'm pretending to admit to myself that I'm fooled
I'm still trying to find my own courage
And live without lies, only you and I, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Painted hard on mystic glass instead of what I wanted to say
But I will never say
That nobody knows what I'm feeling inside
I need to fix myself and not be so shy
Every time I hear voices in my head
I can't stop thinking that I'm insane
I know everything lies on the surface
I'm pretending to admit to myself that I'm fool
I'm still trying to find my own courage
And live without lies only you and I
I know everything lies on the surface
I'm pretending to admit to myself that I'm fool
I'm still trying to find my own courage
And live without lies, only you and I
And live without lies, only you and I
And live without lies, only you and I
