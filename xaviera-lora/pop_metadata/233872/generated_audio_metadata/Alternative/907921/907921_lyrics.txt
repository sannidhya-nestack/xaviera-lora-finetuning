Ooh, yeah
Stamp out this fire to dust
Take what you must
The rest is all mine
Ooh, I can take away
What I didn't say
I'm gonna leave it all behind
Silent tears fall from
The sky tonight
You can take all the sun away
Just because
Burn this page of the past away
You can't take the one
The one that I love
In broken mirrors I've seen
I've seen a face that looks nothing like me
Ooh, you can change a light
You can turn it all to black
But you can't change memories
Stars collide
And burst to life
You can take all the sun away
Just because
Burn this page of the past away
You can't take the one, the one that I love
I can't see
Just what's in front of me here
And I can't explain
So I won't lose
No, I won't lose what I've gained
You can take all the sun away
Just because
Burn this page of the past away
You can't take the one
The one that I love
The one that I love
The one that I love
Yeah, oh, Lord
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, one that I love
