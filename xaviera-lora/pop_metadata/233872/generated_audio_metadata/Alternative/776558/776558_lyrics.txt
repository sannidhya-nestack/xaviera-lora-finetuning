I'll let you comb my hair
I'll let you drown my fear
I'll let you roam and steer
You let me compromise
Each time this thorn inside
Won't let you pull it right
Fade to blue and rise to red
When I hear that number
One, two, make me feel brand new
Three, four, wash this mile up shore
Five and six, a poor man rich
A penny less and couldn't ask for more
Seven, eight, staying up too late
Nine, ten, staring games again
Out of sight, the math is right
Count on me tonight
You make me stop that sign
You make me walk that line
You make me bump and grind
If you subtract the start
And multiply my lot
Yeah we can add it up
If I knew now what I knew then
Give me that old number
One, two, make me feel brand new
Three, four, wash a smile up short
Five and six are four male rich
A penny less and couldn't ask for more
Seven, eight, staying up too late
Nine, ten, staring games again
Out of sight, the math is right
Count on me tonight
And you can count on me tonight
One, two, make me feel brand new
Three, four, wash your smile up
Sure five and six a poor man rich
A plenty listen couldn't ask for more
Seven, eight, staying up too late
Nine, ten, staring games up yet out of sight
The math is right, count on me tonight
One, two, make me feel brand new
Three, four, wash your smile up short
Five and six are for a rich, many listen
Could it last four more?
Seven, eight, staying up too late
Nine, ten, staring games up yet out of sight
The math is right, count on me tonight
