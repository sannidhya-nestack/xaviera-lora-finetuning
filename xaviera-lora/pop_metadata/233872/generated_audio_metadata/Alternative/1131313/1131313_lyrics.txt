Watching, waiting, hurting
Feel a pain like burning anticipating
Always on my mind
Such deliberation
There's no conversation
Never knowing what makes me scared and blind
There were days so full of laughter
Life was good, that's who was on
Now the dark clouds are rolling over
What happened, where did we go wrong?
Was it all lies?
Dirty big lies
Why are you lying to me?
You know how I know
I see it in your eyes
Inside out confusion
One big contradiction
No inspiration when I look above
Searching for some meaning
Torn apart by feelings
This crucifixion you chose for our love
There were days so full of laughter
Life was good then, so awesome
Now the dark clouds are rolling over
What happened, where did we go wrong?
Was it all lies?
Dirty big lies
Why are you lying to me?
You know how I know
I see it in your eyes
We're virgin for some meaning
Torn apart by feelings
This crucifixion you chose for our love
They were dead so full of laughter
Life was good then, so was I
Now the dark clouds are rolling over
What happened, where did we go wrong?
Was it all lies?
Dirty big lies
Why are you lying to me?
You know how I know
I know I see it in your eyes
