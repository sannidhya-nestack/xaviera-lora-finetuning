See that girl over there
Judy with the long brown hair
In the summertime we used to hang together
Holding hands by the beach
Feeling each others heartbeats
Thinking life was perfect I should have known better
And when she walked away I didn't think I'd be okay
But we were just, we were just, we were just a summertime fling
When it came apart I didn't think she'd break my heart
But we were just, we were just, we were just a summertime fling
And when she walked away I didn't think I'd be okay
But we were just, we were just, we were just a summertime fling
When it came apart I didn't think she'd break my heart
We were just, we were just, we were just, a summertime fling
See that girl over there
Judy with the long brown hair
In the summertime we used to hang together
Holding hands by the beach
Feeling each others heartbeats
Thinking life was perfect I should have known better
And when she walked away I didn't think I'd be okay
But we were just, we were just, we were just a summertime flirt
When it came apart I didn't think she'd break my heart
But we were just, we were just, we were just a summertime flirt
