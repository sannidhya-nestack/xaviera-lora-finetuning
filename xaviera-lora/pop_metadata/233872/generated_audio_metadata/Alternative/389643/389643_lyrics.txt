We're over the line, we're over the line
Opium is love, opium is love
Uranium blasting, it's time to dissolve
Will we make it through the 21st century?
Will opium resist for eternity?
We're on the side, we're on the side, we're on the side, we're on the side
Oh, will you let us into the Atomic Garage now? (Right, right now, right now)
Will you lead us away from the carnage now? (Right, right now, right now)
Will you have your gym take us to the final stage now? (You make your up to twenty seconds of silence. Do not hang up.)
They're all down my hide
They're all down my hide
(Beer on the side) I'll be on his mind, I'll be on his wall
Uranium blasting, it's time to dissolve
But we'll make it to the 21st century
The pre-hiring test of nuclear energy
(Beer on the side)
We're on the side, we're on the side, we're on the side
Humans! Come with mother, we have to get out of here! Come on now, quick!
Will you let us into the atomic gates now? (Right right now)
Will you lead us away from the carnage now? (Right right now)
Will you let us into the final stage now? (Take us to the final)
(Stay back to comply with the alert)
(Turn on all lights in the house)
(Open all curtains and shutters to allow the light to shine outside)
