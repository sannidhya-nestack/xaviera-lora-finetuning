There's beauty in the undergrowth
It's feeling its way up
I don't know which ends will hold on
Is there something we should know about?
It's hard
I don't need anyone or anything at all
I don't need anyone or anything at all
I don't need anyone or anything at all
Only you
This greenery entangles
I'm pushing my way out
I will find you if it kills me
This is something you should know about
it's all I have
I don't need anyone or anything at all
I don't need anyone or anything at all
I don't need anyone or anything at all
Only you (I don't need anyone or anything at all)
Anyone or anything at all
Only you
Any war or anything
Any war or anything
Any war or anything
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Only you, only you
Only you, only you
Only
