This is how I call you my dear
An exquisite model for blues and violins
Tonight, the spark of last night's night
This is how I love you
Mystery, mystery, mystery
Stay
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, yeah
Mister, Mister, Mister, yeah
