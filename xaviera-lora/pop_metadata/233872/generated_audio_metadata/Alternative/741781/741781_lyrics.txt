Face me, erase me
Don't trace me, you will replace me
Process me, you won't possess me
You will dissect me
You will et me
Late at night
When darkness falls
Late at night
When the echoes of my calls will fade
We'll say goodbye
Keep turning, keep dreaming
Don't wake me, keep feeling
When darkness fall late at night
When the echoes of my calls will fade
We'll say goodbye
Face me, erase me
Don't trace me, you will replace me
When darkness falls late at night
When the echoes of my calls will fade
We'll say goodbye
Keep turning, keep dreaming
Don't wake me, keep believing
When darkness falls late at night
When the echoes of my calls will fade
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
