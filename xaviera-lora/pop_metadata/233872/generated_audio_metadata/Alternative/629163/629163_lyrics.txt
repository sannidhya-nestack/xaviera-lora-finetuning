Went to the ball downtown
Who are you looking for?
I was just passing by
No, you know I need it all
Have you got any cold beer?
Would you come outside to talk?
Are those handy shoes? Are those handy shoes?
Well, I made my girl happy
Oh yeah, my girl won't be happy
All those ending shoes, all those ending shoes
I wander around, cruising with my girl
Fixing all so deeply called
Into the branches of my old life
Take this gold for your gold knights
Bring it to a faraway land
Bring it where ice melts on water
It's time for you to live
It's time for you to live
Take this cup for your cold night
Bring it to a far away land
Bring it where ice melts on water
It's time for you to live
Float like ice and float out
Till you reach the warmest sun
Keep my heart in your bones
Like you did before
