In my diary, you're still with me
In my dreams
You're still holding me
All the love we've lost
We can't get it back
All the time we've lost
We can't get it back
You're a part of me
Even if you don't wanna be
I can't get you out
I can't get you out of my diary
Oh, the love we've lost
We can't get it back
Oh, the time we've lost, we can't get it back
You're a part of me
Even if you don't wanna be
I can't get you out
I can't get you out of my diary
In your diary, I'm still with you
In your dreams, I'm still holding you
All the love we've lost, we can't get it back
All the time we've lost we can't get it back
All the love we've lost we can't get it back
All the time we've lost we can't get it back
You're a part of me
Even if you don't wanna be
I can't get you out
I can't get you out of my diary
In my diary
You're still with me
In my dreams
You're still holding me
