I can't believe that you love me
And now it's all over
I blame myself for this
The way it all turned out
I'll remember you for always
Even though it hurt
You broke my heart so bad
And still I love you so
Please don't go
Stay here with me
Don't say goodbye
And never leave me
We were so close
You
You and I could never be apart
And even though you gave your word
Somehow I always knew
Please don't go
Stay here with me
Don't say goodbye
And never leave me
I watched you walking down the path
And then I wondered if I'd see you again
And in my heart I was so sure of us
You and me
For all
Always
Please don't go
Stay here with me
Don't say goodbye
And never leave
Please don't go
Stay here with me
Don't say goodbye
And never leave me
I can't believe that you love me
And now it's all over
