I got a whole lot of trouble from the money I got
I got a whole lot of trouble from the money that I got
I got a whole lot of money but I ain't got time
Spendin' damn time on this money of mine
A whole lot of nothin' when I had a lot of time
Had a whole lot of nothin' when I had a lot time
Whole lot of nothin' till I got some money
Had so many friends that it wasn't even funny
Had a lot of action when I had some friends
I had a lot of action when I had some friends
Had some friends but they wouldn't post bail
So I finally found time in the county jail
If you try I bet you can guess
What's the little secret of my success
Don't pity me I've done fine
Having it all one thing at a time
Spending my time in the county jail
Spending my time in the county jail
Ain't much fun swinging this shovel
But I ain't got time to start no trouble
If you try bitch you can guess
What's the little secret of my success?
Don't pity me I've done fine
Having it all one thing at a time
I got a whole lot of trouble from the money I got
I got a whole lot of trouble from the money that I got
Got a whole lot of money but I ain't got time
Spend a damn dime and this money are mine
