It's 2am and you're still trying to
Comprehend the thoughts that, thoughts that keep you
So tell me are you sick of pretending?
When you stare into the static that it was just a
It's 2am and you're still awake
Bathing in the light from a dead show on the TV
All this while your heart's been screaming
Don't you know you shouldn't think what you're feeling
Like a broken record it's repeating
Over and over how instincts are misleading
On that night when I looked into your eyes
I felt like I'd stood here many times before
Try as I might to push it from my mind
Still I find myself dreaming
It's two AM and you are still awake
Bathing in the light from a dead channel on the TV
So won't you tell me if you stare into the static long enough
Does it give you all the answer that you seek?
It's 2 AM and I'm still awake
And my head is spinning like a carousel of memories
And I can tell you if I stare into the mirror long enough
I no longer recognize the face I see
Oh how many years have the gods been asleep my dear?
Beats from a walking sky runs deep tonight, runs deep tonight
Oh my dark kiss will epitomize she said
And her words burn like a snake by electrifying
But it doesn't matter, no it doesn't matter anymore, anymore
It's 2am and you're still awake
Bathing in the light from attention on the TV
So won't you tell me if you stared into the static
Long enough doses give you all the answers that you seek
