Took a late drive to the ocean
Underneath a star filled sky
Flying deep into the open
Mystery lost in our past
Burning down a secret high
Come with me to get it back in your eyes
That you know that you're the only one I know
Don't you know that you're the only one I love
Your sweet laughter like a twister
Tore up through my distant heart
On a desert plain a tree stands
Was it there you couldn't last
Oh, give me a sign, a dream and I
Will dive in to get you out from the dark
Don't you know that you're the only one I know
Don't you know that you're the only one I love
And I'm not giving up
I'll be all better to go in the morning
But you keep on prayin' for rain
You went to every doctor
But you keep on breakin' apart
Don't you know that you're the only one I know
Don't you know that you're the only one I love
I'm never giving up
