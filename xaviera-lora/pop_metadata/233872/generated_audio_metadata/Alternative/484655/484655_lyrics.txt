Sometime you gotta break the chain and step over the line
Every once in a while climb over the wall
You can't dwell on the little things never going your way
Just believe in yourself and you'll find a way
you, you can't carry it that way
All by yourself on your own shoulders
Pretty soon you will come to a place
Where you're gonna need me
To help you along your chosen road
Your chosen road
I see people walking the streets
Have this look in their eye
They're disconnected themselves
From each other's lives
But I know life's more than a syndicated TV show
It's less about who you know
And more about why
And you, you can't carry it that way
All by yourself on your own shoulders
Pretty soon you will come to a place
Where you're gonna need faith
To help you along your chosen road
Oh, chosen road
And you, you can't carry that weight
All by yourself on your own shoulders
And pretty soon you will come to a place
Where you're gonna need faith
To help you along your chosen road
Your chosen road
I believe you'll find it
