So the lens of old browns new
But faces traced like ones I knew
See me walk by the eye
So it's talk of hills that views have missing
And each time you're the line I listen
At least I was right
Cause when I walk it's taking me back
And when I watch I'm on fire
From the church to the railway track
But the top keeps twisting cracks
when I watch'em all on fire
Better watch it on fire
The place it won't take me back
So the lines are all brand new
But places never change their view
Just trick your eyes
when I walk it's taking me back
And when I watch out my home fire
From the church to the railway track
But the darkest dress and cracks
when I watch out my home fire
Better watch it home fire
The place it wants to take me back
It's by my side
It's by my side
when I walk it's taking me back
And when I'm watching I'm on fire
From the church to the railway track
But the talk is stress and cracks
when I'm watching I'm on fire
Better watch it on fire
The place it wants to take me back
The place it wants to take me back
