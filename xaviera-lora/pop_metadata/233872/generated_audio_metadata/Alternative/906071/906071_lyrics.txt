Just breathe in and breathe out
You've been crying for some time now
Lost your mind, living in doubt
Don't know how much more you can allow
But oh, oh, who could've known
That it was wrong to leave you there alone
And oh, oh, tell me where you are
Your life will go on and et all the scars
This is the last time, I won't let you wait for somebody else to take your life away
Last time, but we're still young, mistakes will be made, there's no point to run, run
Let's go back before the lights
If you left me I'd be paralyzed
And here we are
We've come undone
These stakes are high and now we're left with nothing
But oh, oh, we should've known
We'd never make it far into the unknown
And oh, oh, look where we are
We're here and waiting under these a million stars
This is the last time
I won't let you wait for somebody else to take your life away
Last time, but we're still young, mistakes will be made
There's no point to run, run
Here forever
Are we just waiting here forever
This is the last time I won't let you wait
For somebody else to take your life away
This is the last time I won't let you wait
For somebody else to take your life away
Last time but we're still young
Mistakes will be made
There's no point to run, run
