Move a little closer to me
Behind the wall just so nobody can see
We could stay for hours, trying carefully
So why don't you move a little closer to me
Moving through the long grass
Fingers barely touching as if this moment can last
Rolling slowly paper over the past
Making believe that we'll hurt nobody else
You have always been there on the sidelines
Tell myself you're waiting for the right time
When I can give it up and let you be mine
But maybe I've been waiting
Maybe I've been waiting for you to move closer to me
Seems I've been waiting here an eternity
I don't know how much more patient I can be
You got me all low down under siege
Moving in for the kill
You brought me into you like no
I could stay for hours, lose myself in three
So why don't we move a little further still?
You've always been there on the sidelines
Tell myself you're waiting for the right time
When I can give it up and let you be mine
But maybe I've been waiting
Maybe I've been waiting now I'm here in your arms
You say you're lonely but the feeling won't last
You say you need me and I'll run from this dance
Come through your window without a second glance
'Cause maybe I've been waiting
Maybe I've been waiting
Maybe I've been waiting
Maybe I've been waiting
Maybe I've been waiting
Maybe I've been waiting
Maybe I've been waiting
Maybe I've been waiting for too long
Waiting for too long
Waiting for too long
Waiting for too long
And you've always been there in the corner
Telling me how much you don't belong to her
But I can see you in the light of new days
And maybe I've been waiting
Waiting for too long
