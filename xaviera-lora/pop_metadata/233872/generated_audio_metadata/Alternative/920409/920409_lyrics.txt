Do you ever feel alone?
In this great big universe
I'm getting burned but I'm coming out cold
Fear can drive you mad
You tried for all I had
I'm getting burned but I'm coming out cold
I'm getting burned but I'm coming out cold
I'm getting burned but I'm coming out cold
Getting burned but I'm coming out
Oh gold I'm coming out
Oh gold I'm coming out gold
Oh gold I'm coming out
Oh gold I'm coming out
Maybe you have lost someone
You sit alone in the setting sun
Look out across the ocean
All alone in the setting sun
I'm never gonna lose you
I'm gonna fight for you
I'm never gonna lose you
I'm gonna fight for you
I'm getting burned but I'm coming out cold
I'm getting burned but I'm coming
I'm getting burned but I'm coming out gold
I'm getting old but I'm coming out gold
