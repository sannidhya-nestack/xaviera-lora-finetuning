Everybody wants some more
Everybody takes some more
Justified to meet their maker
Satisfied to be your creator
Creators
Creators
You want more out of life
As it sucks out your eyes
Fashion ain't no surprise
No, you're chillin' with the wives
Trapped in your mirror worlds
Silently waiting
But something coming at you
So turn around cause here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes
So I should know what to wear each time, hear everything that you say
Green eyes
Green eyes
You've got to keep yourself alive
Your flame is sharpened and supplied
It's a burning desire before the crucified
Trapped in your world
Silently waiting
But something's coming at you
So turn around cause here it comes, here it comes
Here it comes
The same time, I'm still watching you
See every move that you make
So hard, I'm still watching you
Hear everything that you say
And now it's clear, you know it's time to somewhere
Now you know it's clear, you know it's time to somewhere
Justify the meat they're making
Satisfied to be your creator
