Ooh, ooh, it's your day
Ooh, ooh, a special day
The candles are lit
It's time to make a wish
It only comes once a year
What a special day this is
It's your birthday
Happy birthday
Yes, it's your birthday
Happy birthday
It's not my day
It's your day, it's not my day
It's your day, and there's only one of you
And it's your day, and we'll invite a friend or two
To celebrate your day
It's your birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday
It's your birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday
It's your birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Yes it's your birthday, happy birthday
Happy Birthday (Happy Birthday)
It's your birthday (Happy Birthday)
It's your day (Happy Birthday)
It's your birthday (Happy Birthday)
It's your day (Happy Birthday)
