You make it sound so bleak
Just like the sound of hell
You could steal the breath
Of a sleeping child
I never trust in you
The things you say are the things you do
The thing they all believed in you
You'll never find the answers you've been looking for
Hey you, you hit the ground running
You'll have to catch me if you wanna crucify me
You got yourself a personal mass communion
You're not like me, you'll never be free
Hey you, you hit the ground running
You'll have to catch me if you wanna crucify me
You got yourself a personal mass communion
You're not like me, you'll never be free
You face the endless nights and days with lethargy
Planning your next strike, you'll never beat me
I'll rob you of your slave
You always dream in black and white, monochrome in your mind
You'll never find the answers you've been looking for
Hey you, you hit the ground running
You'll have to catch me if you wanna crucify me
You got yourself a personal mass communion
You're not like me, you'll never be free
Hey you, you hit the ground running
You'll have to catch me if you wanna crucify me
You got yourself a personal mass communion
You're not like me, you'll never be free
Hey, you, you hit the ground running
You'll have to catch me if you wanna crucify me
You find yourself a personal mass communion
You're not like me, you'll never be free
Hey, you, you hit the ground running
You'll have to catch me if you wanna crucify me
You find yourself a personal mass communion
You're not like me, you'll never be free, hey
Yeah, you hit the ground running
You'll have to catch me if you wanna crucify me
You got yourself a personal mass communion
You're not like me, you'll never be free
Hey, yeah, you hit the ground running
You'll have to catch me if you wanna crucify me
You got yourself a personal mass communion
You're not like me, you'll never be free
You'll never find the answers you've been looking for
