I've lost my love
Said all the words I know to make it right
Clutched tight my heart
And closed my eyes
So speak love
What once was beautiful is wretched now my love
Scream love
So all the world will know you're finished with me love
And I never felt like you tried
I want you to carry away all my fears tonight in this lullaby
Every time you laugh you scream feel deep and hear me breathe
The forest gave way to the treachery of trees
And the boys of your past come screaming back
There's options now, filled to last
And the fear that I feel I felt before
When the earthquakes came and crushed the door
And fell to the ground without making a sound
And now
Never felt so alive
I want you to carry the weight of the world tonight
In this lullaby
I loved the way you laughed, babe, loved the way you moved
I loved the way you looked at me every time I stared at you
And there's a million words that would fit the bill
And describe this love in small detail but they're
Bland and broken now
Like strangers' faces in the crowd
And you can scream free your remedy
As loud, as long as you and me
And the girl that I tried to find
You lied, you lied in a lullaby
Oh, oh, every time you laugh you scream feel deep and humid breathe
The forest gave way to the treachery of trees and you lied
