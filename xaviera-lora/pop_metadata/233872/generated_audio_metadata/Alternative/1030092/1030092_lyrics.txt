Try so hard to get things right
Back and forth work through the night
Late into the rising sun
It sucks the life right out of you
You feel there's nothing left to lose
Seems your work is never ever done
Rolling down the mountain just to hit the bottom hard
Get back up again
Take my hand my friend
I can be your shoulder don't give up just one more step
Get back up again
It's true, in life things do go wrong
You're back to the wall, it's hard to stay strong
A million people waiting for you to fail
You're gonna stumble, it's on the cards
Down the mountain, hit the bottom hard
It's a long way up for you to reach the stars
And I see her in the gutter when you thought you'd come so far
Get back up again
Take my hand my friend
I can be your shoulder don't give up just one more step
Get back up again
Nothing's gonna stop you now
You've come too far, you can't stop now
Another step is all it takes
To succeed where others break
The road ahead seems tough right now
The path unclear, there's no way out
Another step is all it takes
To succeed where others break
Get back up again
Take my hand my friend
I can be your shoulder don't give up just one more step
Get back up again
Get back up again
Take my hand and my prayer
I can be your shoulder don't give up just one more step
Get back up again
