He wakes up in his car again with his light lit in
Needle and a tourniquet and a yellow cardigan
That his mother gave him when he was young it's a shame
She'd always been a charlatan with a lonely grin
Beautiful and elegant, just an empty mannequin
And her father caved in when she was young
It's a shame
It will be your friend
It will be your lover
It will be your everything and more
It will be you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
And Edith's gonna come again
With blood and dirt and gin
And he hasn't learned it yet
The morning comes again
And his daughter waits there
After school it's a shame
It will be your friend
It will be your lover
It will be your everything and more
It will be you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
