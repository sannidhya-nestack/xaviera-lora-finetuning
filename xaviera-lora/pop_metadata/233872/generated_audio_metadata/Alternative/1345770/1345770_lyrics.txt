Shadows chasing down my spine
Clicking clocks and neon signs
Static whispers in my head
Flicker, flicker, wire spread
Can you hear the pulse inside?
Electric daydreams
Nowhere to hide
Electric daydream, it's running wild
Sticking hearts and a crooked smile
Electric daydream, it's all the same
Plug me in, set me free
Rust and thunder, concrete skies
Broken signals, pixel eyes
I'm a glitch in your design
Shocking sparks, I'm feeling fine
Can you feel the voltage rise?
Electric daydreams, amplify
Electric daydream, it's running wild
Circuit hearts and a crooked smile
Electric daydream, it's all I say
Plug me in, set me free
Come on now
Come on now
Come on now
