Bring my saber-toothed llama, wear my pink pajama
They're a wedding gift from my in-law mama
I'm getting stir crazy sitting here
Watching your desk plant grow
I'd rather sit out on the pier
And watch the river flow
Too much gathering dust
It's time for us to go (Where you wanna go?)
Down that open road
Slam the door, head out for the open road
I have been in one place too long overload
So let's go before they toll the open road
Come on, let's get on the open road
I did my best to keep it tame for a while (do-wop, do-wop)
But sometimes you gotta let it go buck wild, wild, wild (wild)
Plot a radar, detector, no 5-0's gonna catch her
Driving my Impala like Alibaba
Bring my saber to Lama, wear my pink pajama bearer
Wedding gift from my in-law mama
Destination don't know where
So any road will get us there
Down that old open road
Slam the door, head out for the open road
Got that been in one place too long overload
So let's go before they toll the open road
Hey come on let's get up the open road
Hey, come on, let's get up the open road
Hey, come on, let's get up the open road
Come on now, what you waiting for?
