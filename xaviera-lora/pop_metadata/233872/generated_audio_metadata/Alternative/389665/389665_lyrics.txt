I know for a fact you don't even know what fuck is
Fuck off you freaks, you talk dirty, you talk dirty, you talk dirty, you talk dirty, you talk dirty, you talk dirty
You thought dirty, you thought dirty
You talk dirty, you talk dirty, you talk dirty, you talk dirty
Sex sells but who's buying? Give it up or you're past caring?
What do you think and what are you wearing?
I find the whole act so very tragic
Can't get a wreck, can't even think straight
Can't feel wet, gonna have to wait
When did your fantasy become a reality?
When did your love get burst in my head?
My will to come has come
And I've felt it all along
My will to come has gone and I felt it all along
Sex and sales, but who's betraying?
Lie back and think of nothing
Your breath and your stench made me rich
Wanna be a dog, dog, playing dog fetch
Can't get a quick day of holding
I can feel it sleep, I'm so bored with this
What's the aim here? Who to blame here?
Feel so much more when I'm losing my wrist
My will to come has gone
And I felt it all along
My will to come has gone
And I felt it all along
I know you can't be true
I can smell it inside of you
It's all you had to do
But you had to put me through
My winter gum has gone (my winter gum has gone)
My winter gum has gone (my winter gum has gone)
My winter gum has gone (my winter gum has gone)
My winter gum has gone (my winter gum has)
And I can smell him inside of you (inside of you)
And I can smell him inside of you (inside of you)
And I can smell him inside of you (inside of you)
And I can smell him
But when the time has come, I'll never face it all alone
But when the time has come, I'll never face it all alone
The smell of your gun, it's everywhere inside you
And I'm trying to save you, but I can't stand inside you
Fuck off you freaks
