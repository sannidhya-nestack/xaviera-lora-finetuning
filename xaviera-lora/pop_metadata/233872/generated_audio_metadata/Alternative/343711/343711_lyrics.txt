Room breaking, time to knock the door (yeah) like poor souls (yeah)
Today I said goodbye to the tried soul
It pained me to even say hello because I'm afraid
Sometimes you find me here
And all the harsh things that we say
Lord, I miss it all anyway
I've been handed a heightened sense of reality
We all bleed on the inside
We're soaked to the skin
We'll see you on the outside
But we break like porcelain
Yeah, porcelain
Yeah, I called on everyone and they knew
They neither turned away nor followed through
You are so right
Oh, we're really not that special, no
I'm not the same one that they wish to be
Yet I sense some anxiety
We're in dying heat
Of some clarity
We're afraid of being afraid
We're told to just stand
We're still on BLT
But we've been crying, hustling, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh no, no, no, no, no
Oh, come on
Yeah, we are breathing in the same
We're told to be seen, yeah
We're still on the other side
But we both climb across the land
Could we be less immortal
It's lonely things in the air
We're still on the outside
But we've been trying for so long
Porcelain, porcelain, yeah
