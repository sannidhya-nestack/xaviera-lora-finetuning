Here, in your arms, I'm right beside you
Here, everything else left behind you
Caught up in a mess of blankets, painted eyes and conversation
Time, all I want is to ignore it
I just wanna live here in the moment
But life will call eventually
And one of us will have to leave
Stay right where you are
Please don't go too far
Even when we're apart
Know that my mind's on your heart
So stay right where you are
Then, looking back we had it so good
Now, I'd go right back to where we stood
That's always how I'll remember every part of you forever
Time, all I want is to ignore it and I
Just wanna live here in the moment
But life will call eventually
And one of us will have to leave
Stay right where you are
Please don't go too far
Even when we're apart
Know that my mind's on your heart
So stay right where you are
Stay right where you are
Please don't go too far
Even when we're apart
Know that my mind's on your heart so
Stay right where you are
Stay right where you are
