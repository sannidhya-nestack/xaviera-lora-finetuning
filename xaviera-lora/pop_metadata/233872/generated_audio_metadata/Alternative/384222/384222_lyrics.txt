Alone
What does it mean?
Does anyone really understand?
What can we do?
Where do we go?
What can we do
Where do we go
What can we do
Where do we go
Such pain and suffering
Can't be undone
No best of us can truly be won
Such pain and suffering
Can't be undone
No best of us can truly be won
Alone
What does it mean?
Does anyone really understand?
Ooh
What can we do?
Where do we go?
What can we do? Where do we go?
What can we do? Where do we go?
What can we do? Where do we go?
What can we do? Where do we go?
What can we do?
Where do we go
