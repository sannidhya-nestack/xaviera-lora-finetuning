Patience my lover
You said it to me
You said it to me
I'm going under
Said you're giving away
And you're leaving today
How many times you leave this down
Cause you're angry with me
Cause you're being afraid
Though you're preaching out to me
When you touch the ground set me free
I'm not holding back such things
Since you're giving away
Since you're letting it be
I know you love her
you give it to me
Yeah, give it to me
I'm not saying I'll let you down
But big mistakes will vanish in a while
I'm the one who's supposed to drown
you're being afraid
you're being ashamed
So you're reaching out to me
When you touch the ground set me free
I'm not holding back such things
Since you're giving away
Since you're letting it be
So you preaching now to me
When you touch the ground set me free
I'm not holding back such things
Since you giving away
Since you letting it be
