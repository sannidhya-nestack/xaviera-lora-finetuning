Poison, poison fills my mind
I don't need to run at this time and hide
And hide
Poison, poison hurts my heart
I don't need medicine to come back to life
To come back to life, yeah
Everything became useless and meaningless
I unravel all the shit from the past of my life
But I don't think I would change anything
All I have left is to scream and cry
All I feel inside is poison, poison
All that's left inside is poison
I need no sympathy, better come and kill me
All I feel inside is poison, poison
Poison, poison
Poison, poison
Poison, poison
All I feel inside is poison, poison
All that's left inside is poison
I need no sympathy
Better come and kill me
All I feel inside is poison, poison
Poison, poison
Poison, poison
Poison, poison
