It could have something to do with the air at night
That slips through her hair
Reflecting the lights of the city beneath us
Nothing between us but the dreams we share
Or it could be something in the way she looks at me
That lets me know that she knows everything will be alright
And she is always right
She is the one, she's the only one that sets me free
And I will rise above my fears and fall into her arms tonight
She is the one, she's the only one that sets me free
And I will rise above my fears and fall into her arms tonight
And even if she doesn't catch me
I know she'll let me down easy
With the softest touch, the softest touch
I've ever felt before
But if I land inside her arms
I know she'll never let me go
But if I don't, I'll never know
So I let go
And I'm falling, I let go
I'm falling, so I let go
And I'm falling, I let go
I'm falling, I'm falling down
She is the one, she's the only one that sets me free
And I will rise above my fears and fall into her arms tonight
She is the one, she's the only one that sets me free
And I will rise above my fears and fall into her arms tonight
