All systems check, we are rogered to go
Commencing countdown, two minus ten seconds
Ignition sequence start, five, four, three, two, one, zero
I'll have to thank you my love
Before I have to fake and take it all on
It's alright passion make it loud love
We are alive we are the unbelievable
People like the way I look and the things I say (so innocent, so innocent, yes I am)
So drop into the haze or let your body feel the craze (intimidate, so innocent, oh yeah)
Everybody in the wave can feel the sound, can't walk away (get with it, get with it, break it down)
I'm sick, we need some operation from this timeless sterilization (get sick of it, get sick of it, yes I do)
Your system's falling down
The system's going up and down
My brain is spinning round
It's alright
I have to thank you my love
Before I have to fake it, take it all along
That's alright bash, you make it lot of love
Thank you.
At twelve o' five we come alive and then we all start to vibe
Get with it, can't hit it, cause here I am
I'd like to give you more, I'd like to give you more
But you're innocent, too innocent
I believe this fetish nation will be a world vibration
Live with it, are you with it, say yes I am
Let it be your own salvation, it's meant to masturbation
Don't finish, don't take it, take it from my hands
Your system's falling down
The system's going up and down
My brain is spinning round
It's alright
I have to thank you my love
Before I have to fake it, take it all on
That's alright, passion make it love
You're like water
Go get'em, go get'em, go get'em, go get'em, go get'em, go get'em, go get'em, go get'em, go get'em, go get'em, go get'em, go get'em, go get'em, go get'em, go get'em, go get'em, go get'em, go get'em, go get'em," and then he's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone.
