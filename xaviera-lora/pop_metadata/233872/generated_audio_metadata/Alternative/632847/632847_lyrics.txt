Little green past the sea mountains
With a talcum powder top
Clouds made from cotton wool
Lined with silver foil
This is my mind
Green forest in a boat in the tall trees
A leaf searching through the sea for a time machine
There's nothing here as quiet as it seems
One second back and I'm here again
With daisy chains and paper friends
Try to understand this was never planned
But it's as fragile as castles in the sand
I breathe in this feeling
I cannot give in
Give in to it
Apple trees with paper leaves
Salifying water in the streams
But the grass is still green
Even here in my dreams
Green forest in a boat in the tall trees of Lee
Searching through the sea for a time machine
There's nothing here as quiet as it seems
