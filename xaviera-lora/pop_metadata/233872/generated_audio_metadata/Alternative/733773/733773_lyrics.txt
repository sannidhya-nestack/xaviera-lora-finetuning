Beautiful daydreams taking up my mind
A certain behavior gets me every time
I won't be satisfied till I've crossed the line
I don't believe this mess I'm in
With you, yes it's true
This mess I'm in with you
Slow as the summer heat
It's always slipping through
You were a stranger I once knew
Drunk as the sea under the nicotine moon
I don't believe this mess I'm in
With you, yes it's true
There's a mess I'm in
With you
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I don't believe this mess I'm in
With you, is this true?
This mess I'm in with you, oh
