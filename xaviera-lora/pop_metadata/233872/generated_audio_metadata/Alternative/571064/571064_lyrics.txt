They have tried to watch me burn
They have tried to take me down
But you were always there
To watch me as I fold
What else can I do
But to stay with you
It wouldn't be the same
If they called out your name
I know we'd feel the same
When I call out your name
They have tried to slow me down
Kindred spirit to be found
I could swear I was with you
You seen all the things I did
And see all I do
I'm still there with you.
It wouldn't be the same (If they called out)
If they called out your name (Always be the same)
It will always be the same (The same)
When I call out your name
I am there with you
