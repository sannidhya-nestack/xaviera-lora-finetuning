When I'm with you, the sky's clear, a laugh shared, a whispered cheer
Moments pass like fleeting dreams, chasing thoughts in sunlight beams
Every glance, a spark ignites, holding close through starry nights
Stay with me, let's lose our fears in this dance of joyful tears
So come closer, feel the light, feel the light together
We can take flight, do not die
Feel the light, do you feel the light, do not do the lie
Keep these memories we create
With you happiness can wait
Walking past where laughter grows
Every step the love just flows
Dancing wild like no one's there
Finding comfort in the air
Whisper sweet the world fades out
In your arms there's never doubt
Tell me stories share your dreams
In our hearts lives golden schemes
So come closer
Feel the light
You feel the light together
We can take flight, keep these memories we create
With you happiness can wait
Through the chaos, you calm my mind
In your laughter, I always find
A serene place, my heart's delight
With you
Every moment feels right, so come closer
Feel the light, feel the light together
We can take flight, keep these memories we create
With you happiness can wait
