La la la la la, la la la la la, la la
La la la la la, la la la la, la la
She never played the part of the happy girl
There's no depth in that she'd explain
Living by the moon and what is felt not seen
And most importantly, the mood, that mood
I'm no one in the state
How could anyone understand, stand, yeah
I, I, I
A creature from the black and blue
I found the creature's smile in my box this year
Many human friends, she explains
Living by the sun and what is seen not felt
And not to fall into that mood, that mood
Understand
Now someone understands
Stand
But in some room, darkened by a cloud
Oh, of its own design
A creature sits in depth
Oh, understanding every word
Shame, shame, I've had a say
Oh, but a thousand words too late
And a million miles away
I know I'll understand
How could anyone understand, stand in the light
The creature from the blackened runes
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
We are creatures from blackened runes
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Creatures from blackened runes
Love reaches for blackened rooms
