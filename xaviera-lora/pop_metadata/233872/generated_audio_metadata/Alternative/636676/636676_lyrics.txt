I'm glad I'm not made of glass
But I'm breakable still
Flames that char the insides
Split between the shades
It's confusing to some
They don't understand
they can't see and they can't know
And it's not always a safe place
And it's not always the same place
We're in this head space
This space I call my own
I'm glad I'm not made of glass
But I'm breakable still
And it's not always a safe place
And it's not always the same place
We're in this headspace
We're in this headspace
This space I call my own
