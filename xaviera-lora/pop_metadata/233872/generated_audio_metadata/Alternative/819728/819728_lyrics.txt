The times are getting hard
Man, go away from here
Where has all the love gone
That used to be right here
Maybe I'm a little strange
Doesn't mean you can rearrange my life for me
Can't you see
Look what they have done
Put an eclipse on my sun
So much for being free
In this democracy
Maybe I'm a little strange yeah
Doesn't mean you can rearrange my life for me
Can't you see
Home chains don't spare the horses
Little sister, little sisters in the buses
Home chains don't spare the horses now
You can't crush a man who breathes
If he's got somewhere to hide
I'm not mad though I eat the leaves
I'm the trees on the road I ride
And maybe I'm a little strange
Doesn't mean you can rearrange my life for me
Can't you see?
Home chains don't spare the horses
Little sister, little sisters in the buses
Home chains don't spare the horses, nah
And you know they've tied my hands to the spokes of this wheel
And they play for my life as if I'm not real
And I don't feel
It's been the same since the start of time
They don't try to understand
Those who are different in this homeland
Maybe I'm a little strange
Doesn't mean you can rearrange my life for me
Can't you see?
Okay, don't spare the horses
Little sister, little sisters in the process
Okay, don't spare the horses now
Okay, don't spare the horses
Little sister, little sisters in the process
Okay, don't spare the horses now
Now
Now
Now
Now
