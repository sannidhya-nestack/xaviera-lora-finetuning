Thrill me, thrill me, I am
Tired but I'm bored
Whenever you're ready just lift me the wood
I will drink myself crazy and smoke myself hoarse
What are you taking and can you get more?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Thrill me, thrill me, I
Sense a coming storm
It'll blow me away if I wait too long
Cats stay down forever
Either through pain or pleasure
So I'll drop an unleashment
I'll do my worst
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Thrill me, thrill me but
Don't get me wrong
I will be back on the other side of love
Half dead and crazy
Old old lady baby
I'll tell you my story then you'll laugh at long
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Ah (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty) (Frailty)
Thrill me, thrill me, thrill me, thrill me, thrill me
Thrill me, thrill me, thrill me, thrill me, thrill me, thrill me, thrill me
Thrill me, thrill me, thrill me, thrill me, thrill me, thrill me, thrill me
Yeah!
