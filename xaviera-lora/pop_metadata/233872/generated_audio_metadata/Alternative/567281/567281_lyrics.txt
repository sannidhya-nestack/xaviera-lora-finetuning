You got me right where you want to now
You know you should set me free
if I didn't want to, would you come through?
Should you be the one for me?
Tell me what makes you special
Show me how you make me feel
So alive, yeah
Your true colors are shining through
Your true colors shine
I thought you were the right girl
How stupid could I be?
Once blind but now I see
With all that we've gone through
For you to be untrue
It's clear to see you're not for me
Tell me what makes you special?
Show me how you make me feel so alive
Now your true colors are shining through
Your true colors shine
You thought you could just run around all around town and I would just take it?
Well you got another thing coming baby cause I'm not in this game to fake it
You must be fucking crazy now
Tell me what makes you special
Show me how you make me feel so alive
I wish you were special
