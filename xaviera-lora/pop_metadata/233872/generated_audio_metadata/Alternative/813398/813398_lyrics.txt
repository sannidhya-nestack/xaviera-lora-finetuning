Don't be so blatant, your secrets never safe in a sleepless town
A simple statement that echoes off the pavement may lie profound
The sports still hot, the clouds down
Taking on another fate, fight on, turns out you could be
Guess you've been chasing a lick of fuel embracing a faceless crowd (I guess you could be)
Touch up your makeup to synthesize your face I can feel you scowling but I still don't back down
Take another look babe, right on
Turns out you could be
I think you're unconventional
You're so predictable
I think you're indispensable
Still replaceable
You're unintentional
You're so explainable
That's why I'm skeptical
I bet the body won't stay for long
The wind blows out the flame
And leaves you stalled alone in the dark for days
To start again
So pray your fears away
And don't invest in the past when it's best to pay
For yesterday
Think you're all conventional
You're so predictable
I think you're indispensable
Still replaceable
You're unintentional
But so explainable
That's why I'm skeptical
Seeking importance
That you don't deserve
Struggle to keep my distance
You don't seem to concern
I'll carry on walkin' right into the furnace
I can't knock you persistent sister
But you can't keep flicking your skull
It kicks me into the dirt
Don't think you're unconventional
You're so predictable
You're so predictable
Don't think you're indispensable
You're still replaceable, still replaceable
