(audience laughing)
Ship it away, peel it right back
Eyes to heaven, face down, body back
If it ain't the end of the world, it should be
Too near to the age of the blind and of the free
Be like your man and take the stand
Time to drop a bomb, leap on the promised land
What is left is not worth saving now
Sacrifice a dying cop with a fighting cop
We're all here just to dehumanize
There's no escape, can't ever charize
We're all here just to patronize
To get away is just to fantasize
We're all here just to dehumanize
Snap your own head back in your own vice
Strike out if you want out
Have a dream if you do believe
Be afraid if you haven't paid
If you're a madman try and be self made
Holocaust, Holocaust, I'm the new boss
Tell us all of the price and of the cost if it's too much
Ain't the end of the world, it is mine
Counting the clock back, there's no one else to blame
Right now, it's time for you to fucking leave and find peace with yourself
I'm gentle, I'm not so naive, it's me being out to do a thing for you
And I'm gonna make you feel like you need to move
We're all here just to dehumanize
There's no escape, can't ever try
We're all here just to patronize
To get away is just to fantasize
The fireball will hit directly from the planet
It would be the greatest catastrophe of all
The biggest fireball ever to hit our earth
It certainly will annihilate many many nations
Planet Jupiter is actually going to explode
Everyone should be warned to buy very dark sunglasses
And wear them as I am wearing them now
I owe you, and I'll tell you again, I did not break the law
I can do anything, and never break the law
I did not break the law
He said, "Richard, it's the same thing Jesus Christ called Pilate had."
He said, "You're blaming me for your problem.
You're trying to put the blame on me, and it doesn't fit.
I'm not Richard Milhouse, I'm Charles Millis.
That's it." The demand has evolved itself.
There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so obvious
It gets so sick and hard that you can't take part, can't even make the mistake of trying
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
