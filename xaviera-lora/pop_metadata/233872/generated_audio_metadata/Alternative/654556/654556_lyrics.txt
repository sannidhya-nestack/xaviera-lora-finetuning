Every now and then I gaze up to see your face
And all you have to do is catch that one lonely look
You can always find more time, time to bite
You say you're out but I saw you begin to fish again
Stop, stretch out, breathe in, breathe out
Then you can't go wrong
Stop, stretch out, breathe in, breathe out
Then you can't go wrong
(Humming)
You choose to love or hate
But there are many, many shades of grey
Like a monkey that fell from a tree
Now I wanna be free
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I wanna be free
Ooh-ooh-ooh
How I want it
Stop stretch out, breathe in, breathe out
And you can't go wrong
Stop stretch out, breathe in, breathe out
And you can't go wrong
(Humming)
Stop, stretch out, breathe in, breathe out, howl
And you can't go wrong
Stop, stretch out, breathe in, breathe out howl
And you can't go wrong
(Humming)
