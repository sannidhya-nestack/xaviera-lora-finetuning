Ain't that sentimental, why?
The sound of ship is getting louder
I only want to see me run
The body is in the river
Innocent and divine
The sound of ships makes me shiver
Hope they won't see me run
I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone
