I don't wear a watch on either wrist
Sundial clouded over my eyes
Slept with a lover full of color
And woke with a liar in black and white
Oh, will I see her again?
Oh, this party never ends
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Think back when you're all alone in time flash
When you're having fun
Think back when you're all alone in time flash
When you're having fun
I just might find a poor excuse
If you'd just give me a little time
Don't look at now, don't leave it behind
I've still got what you want
Oh, I'll see her again
See her again
Oh, this party never ends
Ends
And think back when you're all alone and time flies
When you're having fun and think back
When you're all alone and time flies
When you're having fun and think back
When you're all alone and time flies
When you're having fun and think back
When you're all alone, alone
Yeah
Think back, think back
When you're all alone
Time flies, time flies
We having fun
Think back, think back
When you're all alone
Time flies, time flies
We having fun
Think back when you're all alone and just like
When you're having fun and think back
When you're all alone and just like
Yeah, yeah, yeah
