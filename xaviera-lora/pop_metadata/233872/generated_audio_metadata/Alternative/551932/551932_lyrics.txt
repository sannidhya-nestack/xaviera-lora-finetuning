Trevor steps out his front door
It's starting to rain
He goes to the shop and checks his fare
These prices raise
Donna waits at the bus stop
She's late again
She can't get a job she's signing up
Who are they?
Where are you now it's such a shame
It passed us by
Remember when we were both in love
Or maybe at half past two in London
After lunch
I'm packing up all my hopes on a Sunday
After lunch
Or maybe at half past two in London
After lunch
I'm packing up all my hopes on a Sunday
After lunch
Trying to keep his composure
He takes her hand
The clocks have just stopped there
Winding back to where they began
Where are you now, it's such a shame
It passed us by
Remember when we were both in love
Mimi and Herp passed two in London
After lunch, I'm packing up all my hopes on a Sunday
After lunch, I'm leaving at half past two in London
After lunch, I'm packing up all my hopes on a Sunday
After lunch
