I'm right behind you
I'm right behind you
In this queue
Watching everything that you do
Counting your money and licking your lips
A free world at your fingertip
Eleven thirty, start of your day
Walk a mile for the pay
Twenty fags and a pint of milk
Then back to yours after Kilroy's sale
Kill myself
Do you think I'm in your face about this
Well I'll tell you what you think you might miss
A guilty party hello just for you while we sit on the roof
Watching you do what you do do do
Do do do
Little cuts from a magazine
Paper bags and a tambourine
Your head stuck on the sofa arm
Your feet in glue now it won't be long
Won't be long
Do you think I'm in your face about this?
Well, I'll tell you what you think you might miss
A guilty party held just for two
While we'd sit on the fence watching you do what you do, do, do
Do, do, do
Do you think I'm in your face about this
Well I'll tell you what you think
You might miss a guilty party
Hell just for you while we sit on the fence
Watching you do what you do do do
What you do do do
