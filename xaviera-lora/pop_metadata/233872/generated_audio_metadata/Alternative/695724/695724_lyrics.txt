I wish all the forces on me
Would just let me release
Oh, you know
But it's not gonna happen so easy, I think
You know she's gone, gone, gone
It's not getting better
I wish all the people around me
Would just give in to my dream
Oh, you know, oh
No, no, no, no
And now I pay for my crimes
But I am innocent
It's much the same as the lies
That I have given you
So if I was stunned
And you see it
Bitch it's ref me
Just what you think
The plain disease
Pale, sick, rotten old knees
It's threatening everything we could be
Plot so you couldn't see
It's just what you think
All so plain
They'll say you didn't treat everything seriously
And now I pay for my crimes
But I am innocent
It's much the same as the lies that I fell for
Foolish things they think of me
I can't let it happen so easily
I know they try to take everything that I create
It's all a funny game to them it's just the same
I was stunned and you've seen it
