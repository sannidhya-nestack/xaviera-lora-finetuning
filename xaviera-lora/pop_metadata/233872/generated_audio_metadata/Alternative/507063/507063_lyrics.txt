Sunlight dancing romantic shadows
My mind photographs this moment of emotion
We lie naked
Apart from this world
Safe in each other's arms
Loving our devotion
You're so beautiful
You're my wonderful
I sing this song so I might make you see
If you take forever
Multiply with infinity
You then begin to know the way I feel
Summer faces
Tuts alone with happiness
Towering evergreens
That growing in reverence
To my love of you
You're so beautiful
You're my wonderful
I sing this song so I might make you see
If you take forever, multiply with infinity
You then begin to know the way I feel
If you take forever, multiply with infinity
You then begin to know the way I feel
You just begin to feel the way I feel
The sun sets on a perfect day
Complete in every way
No other place to go
And nobody here, dear
But you in my world
You're my beautiful
You're my wonderful
I sing this song so I might make you see
If you take forever, multiply with infinity
You then begin to know the way I feel (I gotta show you how I feel)
So take forever, multiply with infinity
You then begin to know the way I feel
You just begin to feel the way I feel
