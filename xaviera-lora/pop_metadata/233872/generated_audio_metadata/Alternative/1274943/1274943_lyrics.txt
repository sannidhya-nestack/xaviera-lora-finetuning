If you were honest
If you're honest with me
I can be honest
Then you will see, will see
Food on the table
That you left half eaten
It gives me hope
It gives me a reason
And give me all you need
Give me all you know
And tell me what it is to let go
Of this love
Of fire
This love
I fire, I fire
Party is over
And the headache sets in
Without a warning
My breathing, breathing
Cans on the table
That you left for me
Drugs but I'm grateful
Better than dreaming you're with me
And give me all you need
Give me all you know
And tell me what it takes to let go
Of this love, I fire
This love, I fire, I fire
And give me all you need
Give me all you know
Tell me what it takes to let go
And give me all you need
And give me all you know
And tell me what it takes to let go
Of this love, I fire
This love, I fire, I fire, I fire
