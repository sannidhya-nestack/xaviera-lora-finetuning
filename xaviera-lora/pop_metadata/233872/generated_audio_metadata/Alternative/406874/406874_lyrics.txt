If you close your eyes and imagine yourself as a holograph or a dream
You can tell me that I don't exist and that meaning is not what it seems
That an empty sky opens up for us all
So gigantic it hurts just to look
That we're all the killers
The cooks, the writers
The geniuses, judges and crooks
Will I believe you?
I believe you
Well I'm strung out in
The grocery store
And you're strung out in
The grass is sore
We were falling together
From a burning plane
And you said that it's all happened before
Well I believe you
I believe you
The sun will go down soon
We'll get stoned in the dark
And the cats sleep like phantoms past the door
Well, I believe you
I believe you
Yes, I do
Yes, I do
And each day you're with me it explodes into more
It explodes into more
