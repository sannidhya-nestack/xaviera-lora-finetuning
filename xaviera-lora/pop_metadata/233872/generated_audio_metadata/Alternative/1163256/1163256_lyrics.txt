Your show, running to the ground
Can't wait on the thrill a minute more
Let yourself take the abuse
Can't think with a crowded mind
Freaking out
Walk fast on the broken glass
Well it won't matter
You've proved it before
Find some other way
Slow down, try to breathe it
You'll clearly fall apart
You've got to choose
Take it day by day
Stand still just to beat it (tightrope) (can't stop) (can't stop)
Only thing you've ever known
Always on the go
Looks like you're digging your own grave
Digging your own grave
This life will knock you out
Ask for it, you've got it
You'll see what comes around
You live it, you bleed it, you need it
Crime's a horror story
Already, unsteady
Good sense thrown out the window
Burned out in
4, 3, 2, 1
Take credit and the blame
Well it won't matter
When you hit the floor
Find some other way
Slow down, try to breathe in
You'll clearly fall apart
You've got to choose
Take it day by day
Stand still, just defeat it
Tightrope, can't stop
Only thing you've ever known
Always on the go
Looks like you're digging your own grave
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tycho (Tycho), let's go (let's go), let's go (let's go), let's go
Find some other way
Slow down, try to breathe in
You'll clearly fall apart
You've got to choose
Take it day by day
Stand still, just defeat it
Time grows, can't stop
Only thing you've ever known
Always on the go
Looks like you're digging your own grave
