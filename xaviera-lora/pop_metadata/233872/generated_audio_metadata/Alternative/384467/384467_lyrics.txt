I, I love to see your face
Faith in the human race
I break from your loving cup
In the house of fate
I built a room without a name
In the house of fame
My lips are sealed, it's that fame
I, I love to see you move
I, and you're coming around inside your room
I, I
The light in my back could ring
In the house of fame
I built a room without a name
In the house of fame
I lit a sizzling flame
In the house of fate
I built a home without a name
In the house of fate
I lived so silently
Can ever I still flee?
In the house of fate, I built a room without a name
In the house of fate, I lit a sizzling flame
A sizzling flame, a sizzling flame
