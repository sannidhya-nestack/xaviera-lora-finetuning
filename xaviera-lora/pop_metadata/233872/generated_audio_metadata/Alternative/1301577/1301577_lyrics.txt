Ships sail to reach the shores, men fall out to fight their wars, oh can't we dream?
Yes, we dream
Watch him go, watch him now
You will see his space man
Watch him run, watch his speed
We believe
World looks up at the sky
They all scream out, "Come on, spaceman, come join the fight"
In all this time we've dreamed
Watch him go, watch him now
You will see it's spaceman
Watch him run, watch his speed, we believe
Watch him go, watch him go
You will see it's space man
Watch him run, watch his speed we believe
Watch him go, watch him go
You will see it's space man
Watch him run, watch his speed we believe
Oh yes, sweet dream
Oh yes, sweet dream
Oh yes, sweet dream
Oh yes, sweet dream
Oh yes, we dream
Watch him go, watch him go
You will see it's space man (see it's space man)
Watch him go, watch his speed
We believe (we believe)
Watch him go, watch him ride, you will see it's space-made (space-made)
Watch him run, watch his speed, we believe (we believe)
Oh yes, we dream
Oh yes, we dreamed
Oh yes, we dreamed
