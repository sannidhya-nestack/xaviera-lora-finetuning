Stars glow like feathers
We in our eyes around us
And I've been trapped in here too long
Turn off the television
I'm seeing tunnel vision
The phone's been ringing far too long
God if you can hear me
Help my lover find me
There's a part of me that I have lost
Wake me up while I'm sleeping
And wake me up I must be dreaming
Find me while I'm dreaming
Tell me this ain't real
Give me something I can feel
Walking on the ceiling
I'm melting through the walls
Watch as my sky starts to fall
My mind is away, I know it's time to leave
So wake me up so I can breathe
Wake me up while I'm sleeping
And wake me up, I must be dreaming
And wake me up (wake me up) while I'm sleeping (sleeping)
And wake me up (wake me up) I must be dreaming
Look in these eyes
Look in these eyes
Look in these eyes they're closed
Look in these eyes, look in these eyes
Look in these eyes they're closed
Wake me up while I'm sleeping
And wake me up, I must be dreaming
And wake me up (wake me up) while I'm sleeping (sleeping)
And wake me up (wake me up) I must be dreaming (must be dreaming)
In my bed (in my bed) in my bed (in my bed) in my bed
I must be dreaming, must be dreaming in my bed
