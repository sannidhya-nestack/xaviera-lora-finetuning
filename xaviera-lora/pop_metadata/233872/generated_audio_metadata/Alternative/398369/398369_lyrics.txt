Yeah!
Please hand me my pen or did I throw it in the dryer
Don't call me a liar when I say I'm frustrated I mean it
I'm not just confused I feel lost without money
Ain't got no honey but I'm pretty good at getting stung
Now all my clothes are steamed up with ballpoint
I'd make a small point but I'm not sure if I should be wearing the pants here
Been such a bad year all the women and drinking
I know all that you're thinking I say it's such a sad story
I'm sorry I don't mean to bore you
I'm talking blue but what I'm saying is common
I put a lock on my mind and I'm prying it open
I just smoked some oysters and a half shell now
I think I'd like to do some steaming with you
I just had a mountain of my memory come back to me
It's funny that I can't recall anything that bad at all
I just did some dancing in a nightclub and I thought that I was crazy
Everyone else thought I was cool
Just hit the hospital for volts
But I was told it'd be an overdose
I need a shot like you, you know
It's such a sad story
I'm sorry I don't mean to bore you
I'm talking blue but what I'm saying is common
I put a lock on my heart and I'm buying it open
It's such a sad story
I'm sorry I don't mean to bore you
I'm talking blue but what I'm saying is common
I put a lock on my heart and I'm buying it open
