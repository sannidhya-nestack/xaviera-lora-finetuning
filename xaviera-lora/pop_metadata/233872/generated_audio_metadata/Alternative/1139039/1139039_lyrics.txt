I ain't got no time to fool around
So stop pushing me to the ground
Checking me out from the corner of your eye
Before you spoke I was ready to die
I ain't got no time to see you try
God shit, the fan, you blew it all
Better your bitch is ripped enough
Smoke me out slowly
Till we suffocate in a waxful line
All the same, you keep chasing me to change my mind
Punish and call, all the same
You keep asking me to risk it all
To risk it all
To risk it all
To risk it all
'Cause it ain't you, I'm so through
You're trying to ruin me but don't you know I'm not a fool
A girl telling lies
Come here to save the night or I'll have to die
It ain't you, I'm not a fool
I don't want your shit, love
You thought we could date, you're so night-hate
Stun your head, every girl in your bed
It was never you I wanted, you took me for granted
It was never you (cause it was never you)
Cause it ain't you
I'm so through
Yeah, try and hurt me
But don't you know I'm not a fool
'Cause I ain't got no time to fool around
So stop pushing me to the ground
Take me out from the corner, yeah
Before you spoke, I wasn't ready to die
I ain't got no time to see your type
Gosh shit the thing you put all
Better your bitches ripped enough
Smoke me out slowly
Till we suffocate in a week's one night all the same
Keep chasing me to change your mind
When it's your call all the time you keep asking me to risk it all
Baby to risk it all (to risk it all)
To risk it all (to risk it all)
To risk it all
'Cause it ain't you, I'm so true
You're trying to ruin me, but don't you know I'm not a fool
'Cause it ain't you, I'm so through, it ain't you, I'm not a fool
it ain't you, I'm so through
