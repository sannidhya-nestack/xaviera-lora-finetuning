Oh, won't you be mine tonight?
You drive me crazy but that don't make me yours
I am in love with you
Give me what I want, give me what I need
Give me what I want, give me what I need
I'm so in love
I'm so in love
Run, run, run for the hills
Run, run, run for the hills
Run, run, run for the hills
Run, run, run for the hills
Oh, won't you be mine tonight?
You drive me crazy but I don't make these yours
I am in love with you
Give me what I want, give me what I need
Give me what I want, give me what I need
I'm so in love, I'm so in love
Run, run, run for the hills
Run, run, run for the hills
Run, run, run for the hills
Run, run, run for the hills
Run, run, run for the hills
Run, run, run for the hills
Run, run, run for the hills
Run, run, run for the hills
