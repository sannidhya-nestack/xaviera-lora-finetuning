Oh, you tell me to step back, step back
Then you tell me to come close, come close
But I tell you that I won't, I won't, no
Then you tell me I'm messed up, messed up
But I really can't fess up, mess up
To all the charges that you made
Don't mean to rain on your parade
But I do, I do
And this is a toast to my release
From all of you contracts and late fees
Wasn't gonna mention poor reception
Go ahead and take this to collections
It's me dropping the line
This is me dropping the line
Your relentless temper, temper
I'm expected to take it, take it
But I know that I can't, I can't, no
Won't ever change for you, you
You make me feel like nothing, nothing
I know that life's a compromise
But I won't make one here tonight
No I won't, I won't
And this is a toast to my release
From all of your contracts and late fees
Wasn't gonna mention poor reception
Go ahead and take this to collections
It's me dropping the line
This is me dropping the line
Don't you try
Don't you try
Don't you try and know that I'll be fine
Don't you try to take me back this time
And this is a toast to my release
From all of your contracts and late fees
Wasn't gonna mention poor reception
Go ahead and take this to collections
This is a toast to my release
From all the become tribes and late fees
Wasn't gonna mention poor reception
Go ahead and take this to collections
It's me dropping the line
This is me dropping the line
This is me dropping the line
This is me dropping the line
This is me dropping the line
