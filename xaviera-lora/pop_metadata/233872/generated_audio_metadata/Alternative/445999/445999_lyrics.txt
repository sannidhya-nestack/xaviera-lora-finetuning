Jimmy's got a new ride and he's coming around
He's got the tunes turned up and the top is down
We're cruising down to the lake where we're meeting
Up with Stevie, Bobby and Jake
The sun shining bright about eleven o'clock
We got two star coolers sitting under the dock
The girls are all getting tan, oh man
They look so good running round in the sand
It's a trip when we get together
Can't get it the way that we want when we wanna
It's how it goes with my friends in the summertime
We're setting up shop at the top of the hill
We got dogs and burgers cooking up on the grill
Now the girls all come by so biddy
Grab yourself a cold one and don't be shy
The sun's going down and we're having some beers
It's the same old can we've been kicking for years
Nothing's bringing me down with Jimmy, Stevie, Frank, Bobby, Jake, Tony around
It's a tramp when we get together
Kicking it the way that we want, where we wanna
Tower goes to my friends in the summertime
Let's get some wine
It's a trip and we get together
Can't get it the way that we want when we wanna
Tell what goes to my friends in the summertime
It's alright
It's a trip and we get together
Can't get it the way that we want when wanna
Tell what goes to my friends in the summertime
One more time
It's how it goes with my friends in the summertime and we're still chasing to hill
It's how it works with my friends in the summertime
Summertime, yeah the summer
Summertime in the summer
Summertime, it's the summer
The summertime, yeah
It's how it goes with my friends in the summertime
