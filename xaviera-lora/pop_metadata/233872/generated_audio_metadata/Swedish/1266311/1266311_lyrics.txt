Selma ennorkent, ja serbej
Ektasum hudar i vi apu ve
The lights are flashing
Bodies in motion
Feel the rhythm
Feel the divorce
There's more magic than you feel it too
Fear for me all the high, oh dude
Spinning around on the disco lights
Lost in the music, so I'll rent your new heights
It does feel okay, somewhere I'm never
Stick for stick, the ice on my hip
Your eyes, your smile, pulling me closer
On the floor, we're never getting over
Guess what magic can't you feel it too?
Video phone, yeah, you had your due
Spinning around on the disco lights
Lost in the music, we're soaring to new heights
Your dance today, some in my head
Stick for stick, reality's on my head
Your eyes can smile, pulling me closer
On the floor, we're never getting over
There's more magic, can't you feel it too?
If only I had a high, I would do
Spinning around under crystal lights
Lost in the music, we soar into new heights
In the sea, bending in the sky
I'll give you hope that you, oh yeah
Bass drops and we lose control
The low life ain't nothing, they bleeding hell
There's no magic, it's where we belong
We don't sell tears, nothing beats this song
From the stars to the morning light
