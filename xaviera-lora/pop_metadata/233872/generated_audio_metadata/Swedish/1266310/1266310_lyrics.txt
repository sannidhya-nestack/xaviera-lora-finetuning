Åten skal det lyser til, yeah
Med dina mål, you light up the night
Vi snurrar rundt, vi slipper alt
In this moment it feels so right
Disco nights we live it for the high and the new
You set the heart on the band
Dance with me baby'til the break of dawn
Disco nights we're never gonna fall
Rytmen tar oss långt om på
Blank ytter och ljus, we're losing control
Din hand vill inte svæva fram
Together we're dancing to our song
Disco nights, we never felt ahead and anyone used to be hot or be bad
Dance with me baby,'til the break of dawn
Disco nights, we're never gonna fall
Disco nights, never be found
I really wanna feel something hot off your body
Dance with me beneath the silver moon at dawn
This storm won't never go away
Holding out I feel the beat
In a flash of light I can't repeat
Nothing of worth it's hard to move
This good night's the part I'll do with you all
This good night's the never-ending high
Underneath your use of me hot off your body
Dance with me goodbye
Disco nights, deliver for the high
Under neon, using V-hard, I'll be bad
Dance with me baby,'til the break of dawn
Disco nights, we're never gonna fall
Nattene får vi ta det nu, det skal nejste bare du og jeg
