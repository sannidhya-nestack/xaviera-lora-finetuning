Tu vet' a tour des halos de
Every step, every breath, it's true
Me a triveli, me a stupor cor
Can't you see, I'm the one for you
Can't you see I'm your man
Holding you just to take my hand
But uh, in the night, because of hate
You found my object for to stay
Can't you see I'm a man
I love you the best I can
And I know what I feel, joy, infinity
You had to follow through your start
I'm the rock when your world's so dark
And you're the order when you're near
With you I'm always near
Can't you see I'm your man
Holding you just take my hand
In the night through the day
Yeah, esta es mi autentica rustia
Oh, I stay
Can't you see I'm your man
I love you the best I can
Me enamor a ti
Soy quien te apetece
Ooh, like a fall on the face of it
You're acting so we can hold apart
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Can't you see I'm your man
Holding you just take my hand
In the night through the day
Jeg stanner alltid kvar hos dig
Can't you see I'm your man
I love you the best I can
Ingen annan bara vi
Jeg er din for evig tid
Can't you see I'm your man
I'll love you the best I can, I'll run
Being on a motorbike, joy beams theivity
See you, now I'll give you the best I can
Being on a motorbike, joy beams the love
For a face I make, I drop and then send a candlelight fall
Ooh ooh ooh
Can't you see I'm your man? Can't you see I'm your man?
Can't you see I'm your man?
Holding you, just take my hand
In the night, through the day
Jeg stanner alltid kvar og steg
Can't you see I'm your man?
I love you the best I can
Ingen annan bar vi
Jeg er din ferdigvittig
