The sun is rising
Another day begins again
Every day is still the same
I come back and see your face again
I know you're hiding something
But you never tell me what
And this my inner feeling never falls for your lies
I know what's running in your mind
What's running in your mind
Surely or change you must decide
You must decide
The time is running and nothing is changing now
It's un ettable, it's un ettable
You still ignore me like I don't exist
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable
I stand, I stand in front of you, you look, look into my eyes
It's un ettable, it's un ettable
It's like suddenly, suddenly I became, became invisible, invisible
The moon comes up and then we know this day has dawned
You love the night so when it comes you leave me all the time behind
I know every step you're gonna make
Tonight you never hesitate to think twice
And this my inner feeling tells me truth
I simply cannot deny
Now, what's running in your mind?
What's running in your mind?
Surely, our change
You must decide, you must decide
The time is running and nothing is changing now
It's un ettable, it's un ettable
You still ignore me like I don't exist
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable
I stand, I stand in front of you
You look, look into my eyes
It's un ettable, it's un ettable
It's like sun is shining in the eye
Making me invisible, invisible
Invisible
Invisible
Here we go
We fight, fight again
We do but we survive
And that's the truth
But this time it has to change
Can't ive, I can't ive
It's un iveable, un iveable
Un iveable, un iveable
The time is running out, nothing is changing now
It's un ettable, it's un ettable
You still ignore me like I don't exist
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable
I stand and stand in front of you
You look and look into my eyes
It's un ettable
It's un ettable
It's like suddenly suddenly
I became, became invisible
Invisible
It's un ettable
It's un ettable
It's un ettable
