I can call it two wild things
But there are only all my things
I stand in my city
Naomi Gaines
So unique in every world
Here to time her mother again
Somebody sent pictures with
With me oh I made it was to death for love
Me a god selling
So I know gotta shut
Selling this stuff ya will miss
While I appreciate
The starting
While I hope for my next birth
Yeah, somebody's brain's all right
What's the repeat? It's a cop-op around the front of set
I'm flicking down upon the sides
Promise you'll know how to find all the souls
But promise it
With you I'll make it close to death for love
When you're caught sailing
So I know that it's just
Said they stuck down with us
While my pizza ain't restarted
While I laugh on my dance floor
