All the girls seem to wonder who she is
All the men standing light, steal a kiss
New girl this town's never seen before
She's hot that's undeniable
All the guys getting unreliable
This girl's not easy to ignore
She'll make you turn to work the other way
Without a sound you're blinded
So don't you listen to what she says
She can't rewind it
You're gonna lose, you can't resist
The way she moves, her swaying hips
It's like a magnet pulling you everywhere she goes
You're gonna lose, you cannot win
The way she moves, it is your baguette
She's gonna leave you breathless every time she moves
You're gonna lose, oh, you're gonna lose
She's a girl that should stay inside your head
Not waking up beside her in her bed
Is it worth getting kicked out of your door?
Stay away she will cast a spell on you
Same old's gonna drive you crazy too
This girl's gonna leave you begging more
She's twisting every bit of word you say and make you feel divided
So don't you turn and walk the other way, you can't rewind it
You're gonna lose, you can't resist
The way she moves, her swaying hips
It's like a magnet pulling you everywhere she goes
You're gonna lose, you cannot win
The way she moves, it leads you back in
She's gonna leave you breathless
Every time she moves, you're gonna lose
You're gonna lose
You're gonna lose
Oh, you're gonna lose
Her magic will trick you
Don't know how hard it's gonna hit you
Don't let her, don't beg her
Don't you surrender
You're gonna lose, you can't resist
The way she moves, her swaying hips
It's like a magnet pulling you everywhere she goes
You're gonna lose, you cannot win
The way she moves, it leaves you begging
She's gonna leave you breathless every time she moves
You're gonna lose, the way she moves
It's like a magnet pulling you everywhere she goes
You're gonna lose, you cannot win
The way she moves, it leaves you begging
She's gonna leave you breathless every time she moves
You're gonna lose, oh
