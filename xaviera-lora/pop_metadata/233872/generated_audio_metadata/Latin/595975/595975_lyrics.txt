If you're looking for a little romancing
First of all, you gotta get your feet dancing
I can tell by the look in your eye
That you are very willing to try
Your direction is utter perfection
It's the thing that I want to employ
I assure you that love will improve
When your feet will start to move
To this funny little island beat
Funny little Latin beat
Funny little Latin beat
Oh so neat
Funny little Latin beat
Funny little Latin beat
Funny little Latin beat
Oh so neat
Put me down for the way that you sway
I am sold on the style that you play
I can wait for my hand on your waist
It's all down to the rhythm we faced
I want to cling like a grape to the wine
Till I know that you're gonna be mine
I can tell that you go with the heat
Of this funny little Latin beat
Yes, this funny little Latin beat
Funny little Latin beats
Funny little Latin beat on the street
Yes it's funny little Latin beats
Funny little Latin beat
Funny little Latin beat on the street
Yeah, I'll montage the long quiet sighs
Quintus and Johanns that entwine
I ain't beginning to know you were mine
All the night and the music and wine
All that remains to be said
Is that I'm reading thoughts in your head
I presume that you're dancing so neat
of this funny Latin beat
Oh, this funny Latin beat
Funny little Latin beat
Funny little Latin beat
It's complete
Funny little Latin beat
Funny little Latin beat
Funny little Latin beat
It's complete
Love to beat
