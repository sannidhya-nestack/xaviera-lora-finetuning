Take me away, take me to paradise
It comes at a price, but the air is twice as nice
Take me away, take me to paradise
It comes at a price, it'll fill your life with spice
I wake up in the morning and the sky outside is gone and it is just another grateful day
I turn to shut my curtains cause everything is hurting I wish that you would come my way
Take me away
Take me to paradise
It comes at a price
But the air is twice as nice
Take me away
Take me to paradise
It comes at a price
It'll fill your life with spice
Another night I'm breaking and I feel my body shaking
Work is draining my soul today
I need to pull my feet off my body
It feels bitter but I wish that you would come my way
Take me away, take me to paradise
It comes at a price, where the air is twice as nice
Take me away, take me to paradise
It comes at a price, it'll fill your life with spice
Take me away, take me to paradise
It comes at a price, where the air is twice as nice
Take me away
Take me to paradise, it comes at a price
It'll fill your life with spice
Take me away, take me to paradise
It comes at a price, where the air is twice as nice
Take me away, take me to paradise
It comes at a price, it'll fill your life with spice
