I'm growing while I'm sweating, oh
So my race was a mile and a half, oh
I'm staying true, I know
It's okay, it's not for real, oh
I'm a fool in your house, I know
So my race was a lie, they knew
I'm a sinner too, I know
In the gates, but they're all over me
I'm a straddle-eye
I'm a straddle-eye
I'll travel by
I could stop and go
So many times I've been through
I've stayed true and I know
There ain't nothing I'd rather find
Time to go outside and go somewhere in the night
Time to say goodnight and go to bed and wake up to a troubled night
