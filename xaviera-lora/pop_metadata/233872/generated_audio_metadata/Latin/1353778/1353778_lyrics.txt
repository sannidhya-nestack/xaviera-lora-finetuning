Sundown, skin glow, rhythm in the sand
Rum on my lips, I better take my hand
Lights flash, palms swayed in the mist, yes
Boy you know the trouble tastes like this
Dominicana night, Jamaica moon, he said mommy slow
I said boy too soon, we dance so close, she call me miss
I whisper sweet cherry kiss
Champagne running down my wrist
Body moves like we can't resist
No rules, no time, just bliss in a place like this
Cherry kiss, cherry kiss
Cuba bring me skirt go high
Latino heat make the angels sigh
Sex parallel to the ocean air
He say te quiero but I don't care
Costa Rica sun heat on my skin
He say mi vida I just grin
We lost control in a tropical twist oh boy
Ya fall for a cherry kiss
Champagne running down my wrist
Body move like we can't resist
No rules no time just bliss in a place like this
Cherry kiss cherry kiss
Mmm, da-da-da-da-da
Mmm, mm-mm-mm
Roto, you make the night burn slow
From Kingston Street to Santo Domingo
No love, no lie, just sound and sin
The way you move me lose within
Shows up running down my wrist (hey)
Body move like we can't resist (oh)
No love, no shame, just bliss in a place like this
Cherokee, Cherokee
Champagne running down my wrist
Party mood like we can't resist
No love, no shame, just bliss
In a place like this
Cherry kiss, cherry kiss
Findo
Sundown, skin glow, rhythm in the sand, yeah
Rum on my lips, I better take my hand, yeah
Lights flash, palms swayed in the mist, it's
Boy, you know the trouble tastes like this
Stump in the ground tonight, Jamaica moon
He say, "Mommy slow," I say, "Boy, too soon"
We dance so close, he call me miss
I whisper sweet cherry kiss
Champagne running down my wrist
Body move like we can't resist
No rules, no time, just bliss
In a place like this
Cherry kiss, cherry kiss
You, Roberto, you make the night burn slow
From Kingston Street to Santo Domingo
No love, no lie, just sound and sin
The way you move me, lose within
They're running down my wrist (oh)
How do you move like we can't resist (oh)
No love, no shame, just bliss in a place like this
Cherry kiss, cherry kiss
Stay down
