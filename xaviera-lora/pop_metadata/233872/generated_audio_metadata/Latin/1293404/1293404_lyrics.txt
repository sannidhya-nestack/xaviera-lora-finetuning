On the beat where the waves collide
Your touch sparks flames I cannot hide
The wind sings songs of you and me
A burning love has deep as the sea
Your eyes ignite a wild desire
With every glance you feed the fire (raising hope)
My heart's beat fast, perfect tune (open sky)
Under the spell of the glowing moon (silver glow)
Dance with me, let the river flow (be the art)
Feel the passion, let the fire grow (shining soul)
We're the stars in a midnight game (oh stay)
Two as one, never be the same (true love)
We're the stars in a midnight game
Two as one never be the same
Your eyes ignite a wild desire (crazy dream)
With every glance you feed the fire (crazy pulse)
Our hearts beat fast and perfect through
Under the spell of the glowing moon (show up)
Dance with me, let the rhythm flow (feel it hot)
Feel the passion, let the fire grow (shine your soul)
We're the stars in a midnight game (mind your place)
Two as one, there'll be the same (true life)
We're the stars in a midnight game
Two as one never be the same
True life
