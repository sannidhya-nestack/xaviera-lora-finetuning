I've grown accustomed to being a sat line protector
Guard the wall, the meals, Achilles, I am Hector
My comfort zone where I'm at home being all alone
Yet I hear magic on the microphone
I didn't used to be this way
I was free back in the day
As a boy I used to dance
Laugh and move at every chance
As the years went by
I let go
But here I come
I'm coming home again
I know we could move if we could find the dance floor
I know we'd get crazy and we could maybe transform
Our bodies moving like we lost ourselves
Long ago we stopped I can't remember why
I know we could move if we could find the dance floor
I know we'd get crazy and we could maybe transform
Our bodies moving like we lost ourselves
Long ago, we stopped, I can't remember why
I'm a fool whether I dance or not
Might as well move while I'm in the spot
I feel the groove and I start to sway
I can feel the world melt away
And bodies never lie
People's random thoughts through the sky
Dance until the stars come down
We can feel it all around
As the years went by
I let go but here I come
I'm coming home again
I know we could move if we could find a dance floor
I know we'd get crazy and we could maybe transform
Our bodies moving like we lost ourselves
Long ago, we stopped I can't remember why
I know we could move if we could find the dance floor
I know we get crazy and we could make it transform
Our bodies moving like we lost ourselves
Long ago, we stopped I can't remember why
