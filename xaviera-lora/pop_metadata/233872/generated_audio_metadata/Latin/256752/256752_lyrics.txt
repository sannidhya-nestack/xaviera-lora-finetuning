She's like a knife, she cuts deep inside
You don't know if she's in you,'cause she's in disguise
Only a man can fall for her lies, only a man
Gets hypnotized (ooh, don't be rude)
Smooth like a thief
She comes at night (comes at night)
In your dreams
Like the song that says
The Spanish Lullaby
You've got to realize
She's in your head
Oh, don't be a fool, hey, yeah
Don't let her hypnotize you with her eyes (her eyes)
This is a stronger than a tranquilizer (tranquilizer)
She'll leave you with things until you can't deny (can't deny)
she's the master of your mind (of your mind)
Don't let her get, oh, the best of you
Hey, hey, please
Don't let us work our way into your heart
Touch ground and your world just torn apart
Shall make you change your mind
Hopelessly, dangerously
Can't you see, in reality
You're in jeopardy, you can't breathe
She cuts deep inside, you don't know she's in you
she's in disguise, only a man can fall for the lies
Only a man gets hypnotized
Ooh, don't be a fool
Like a thief, she comes at night
In your dreams, like the song that says "Famish, Mama, bye"
She's in your head, don't be a fool (don't be a fool)
Don't wanna hypnotize you with her eyes (her eyes)
Her kisses are stronger than a French woman (stronger than a woman)
She can hypnotize you and I can't deny it (ooh)
she is the master of your mind (of your mind)
Don't let her hold the best of you
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't let it swerve away into your heart
The touch will leave your world just torn apart
She'll make you change your mind
Hopelessly, dangerously
Can't you see, in reality
You're in jeopardy, you can't breathe
Don't let it swerve away into your heart
Her touch will leave your world just torn apart
Change your mind, don't change your mind
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh
Come on, don't let her hypnotize you with her eyes
Her kisses are stronger than a tranquilizer
She'll weaken your knees until you can't deny it
she is the master of your mind
Don't let her get the best of you
