Gonna drive, drive it all night
Into the night
Gonna drive, drive it all night
Tell it don't it move
Gonna drive, drive it all night
Into the night
Gonna drive, drive it all night
Every move
Come on now, let it go
Come on now, let it go now, oh
Come on now, let it go
Come on now, let it go now, oh
Don't try, try it all night
Into the night
Don't try, try it all night
Tell it don't remove
Don't try, try it all night
Into the night
Don't try, try it all night
Every move
Come on now
Let it go
Come on now
We're gonna drive, drive it all night
Into the night
Go drive, drive it all night
