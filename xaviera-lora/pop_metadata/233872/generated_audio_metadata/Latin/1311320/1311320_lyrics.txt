Got the sun on my skin, the vibe so fine
This idle breeze, pure and dead sun, why?
The rhythm on the radio feels like a perfect sign
Tropical waves crashing where two hearts align
You and me, we're just cruising with no rush
In a paradise where the memories hush
Tell me where we're going tonight
After the party
I'll bring the laughter and you bring the hearty
We'll dance on the stars'til we see the light
Embrace the magic of our nights
The ocean's calling I can't ignore
Stress and melody make my spirit soar
The moon is a spotlight on the sandy shore
In the summer dream I crave a little more
The world pauses only you and me
Live in the moment, wild and free
Tell me where we're going tonight
After the party
I'll bring the laughter and you bring the hearty
We'll dance on the stars till we see the light
Embrace the magic of our nights
Feel the rhythm, let it take control
In paradise, set your heart on a roll
No worries tonight, just the music's real
In this tropical house, time to stand still
Tell me where we're going tonight
After the party
I'll bring the laughter and you bring the heart
We'll dance on the stars till we see light
Embrace the magic of our lives
