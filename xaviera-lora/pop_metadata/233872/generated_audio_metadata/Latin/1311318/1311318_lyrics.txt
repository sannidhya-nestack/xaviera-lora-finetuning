Oh, oh, hey, oh, oh, I am alive
Oh, oh, hey, oh, oh, oh, I am alive
Oh, oh, hey, oh, oh, hi, I am alive
Oh, oh, hey, oh, oh, bye, I am alive
You don't need your feelings love to go higher than I
You come and move as you would thought to go higher than I
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, higher than I
You don't need your feelings love to go higher than I
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, higher than I
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, higher than I
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, higher than I
I'll be back, oh, oh, wait, oh, oh, I'll be back
Oh wait, oh I'm not, oh wait, oh I'm not
Oh wait, oh I'm not, oh wait oh I'm not
