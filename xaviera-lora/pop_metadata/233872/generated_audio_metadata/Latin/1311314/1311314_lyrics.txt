They saw something fly there
The air deep when I cough
And all of the mind
Sounds more concerned
And fed off of my nervous
So I'm here
Getting like I'm playing mine
So where are my shoes?
My soul will find them
Die with me
Don't fly
Dead to the red, she said, "You need gold"
The world is in your head
You won't want to leave, love me like not you should
There's no way to find out how you will be done with the life now
Dead to the red, she said, "You need gold"
The world is in your head
You won't want to leave, love me like not you should
There's no way to find out
Now stormy fires of joy will be done for livin'
This precious day before the world to reach the grave
Won't walk away, love me like I used to do
Now stormy fires of joy will be done for livin'
There's a rat who's standing over the world in red
No one will be good like you
Their soul will find them dying when they come to life
There's a rat who's standing over the world in red
No one will be good like you
Their soul will find them
