All the seasons, all the seasons in the air and in the clouds
Every time I see you, there's never any doubt
You remember, you remember, the times were all I see
Things you couldn't understand were not even me
Never needed one, could you ever know
The times were always plentiful
And I see your light and I roll in your charms
Well I have suffered and I know that you have too
But love never understands and the sea is always blue
There is never, there is never, no doubt I had in mind
The mind is on the encounter so the feelings inside
We're on the road again
We're on the road again
Our love is all we ever see
And I feel your presence in me
Don't you love to love her
Oh I do love to love her so
Don't you love to love her
Oh can't you see
You're the captain
He's thrown me overboard
Oh, I don't remember how the sea felt before
Ooh, I remember how I felt that day
The pleasure and the joy
No efforts ever needed to grow in this world
Would you stay with me? Would you stay and roll?
The others they would try to rinse you otherwise
But I see and feel you all the time
Oh don't you love the lover
Oh I do love the lover so
Oh don't you love the lover
Oh I do love the lover
Oh don't you see
Oh don't you love the lover
Oh don't you love the lover
Oh don't you love the lover so
Oh don't you love the lover
Oh I do love the lover so
