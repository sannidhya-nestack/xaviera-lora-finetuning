And it ain't that loose, but I used to keep me busy
And it ain't that loose, I ain't no wrong that way
And it ain't that loose, but I used to keep me busy
And it ain't that loose, I ain't the wrong that way
C'est la vie de pouce, c'est la vie de pouce
I can't believe it (yeah)
And then I lose, then you stay, then you stay
And then I lose, then you're on the way
And then I lose, then you stay, then you stay (woo)
And then I lose, then you're on the way
Take me close, take me close
Oh, oh, oh
Ain't nothing new, nothing new, can't fix it
Ain't nothing new, ain't nothing new, I don't got it
Ain't nothing new, ain't nothing new, can't fix it
Ain't nothing new, ain't nothing new, I don't got it
That's what I've been doing
