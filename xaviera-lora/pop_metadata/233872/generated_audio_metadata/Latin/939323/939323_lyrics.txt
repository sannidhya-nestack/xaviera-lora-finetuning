You say it, you play it
You act like it's a part of you
You mean it, let's see it
Show me now what you can do
Spread your wings and fly
Spread your wings and fly (let it all go)
Let it all go (let it all go)
Move it to cuerpo
Let's go now, and show how
You can shake the earth beneath your feet
Get up now, rise up now
Everyone around will feel the beat
Shout it to the world, let it be known
Let it all go, move it like you're quite at home
I, I, I, I, I, I, oh
I, I, I, I, I, Oh
I, I, I, I, I, O
I, I, I, I, I, Oh
Come on, come on, come on
Everybody need love
Move your body, yes
And it's out, let's move it
I, I, I, I, I, I, oh
High, high, high, oh
