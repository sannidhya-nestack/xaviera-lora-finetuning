Now I'm feeling so relaxed, loose and thoughtless
I don't care about the past
I only care about this breeze
And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Where troubles have gone
And I don't need to know
And I don't need to know
And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
If tomorrow will be better
And I don't want to know
And I don't want to know
I only care about you
Lying next to me, I only care about you
So let's share, let's share
Let's share, let's share
How nice to still enjoy
Of doing nothing special
Like a carefree little boy
Running faster
And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know where troubles have gone
And I don't want to know, and I don't want to know
And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know if tomorrow will be better
And I don't need to know, and I don't need to know
I only care about you, lying next to me
I only care about you
So let's share, let's share
Let's share, let's share
Let's share, let's share
Let's share, let's share
Let's share, let's share
Let's share, let's share
