What is this my friend would you let us know
We have travelled so far and this has never been a one man show
Now you let us see that you have other fish to fry
We're worried and confused and you cannot imagine why
No indifference don't make us work on like this
It makes no sense, no more indifference
We always thought that we'd been more than the sum of our parts
Involved with our hearts
The only way to make things work
Sometimes the water in the river of our lives
Flows faster like in rapids with an untamable drive
Keep the rudder steady to stay right within the flow
Then you'll still have time enough to decide which way you want to go
No indifference
Don't make us work on like this
It makes no sense
No more indifference
We always thought that we'd been more than the sum of our parts
Involved with our hearts
The only way to make things work
Do you think in terms of money
That you might spend on your honey
Remember once we swore we were up to some good
We hooked jazz to soul
Playing funky tunes for the neighbourhood
And rock and roll
No indifference don't make us work on like this
It makes no sense no more indifference
No indifference don't make us work on like this
It makes no sense no more indifference
We always thought that we'd been more than the sum of our parts
Involved with our hearts
The only way to make things work
