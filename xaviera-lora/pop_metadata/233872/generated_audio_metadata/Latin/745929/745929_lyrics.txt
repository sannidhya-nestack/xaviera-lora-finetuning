I feel a kiss from your sweet lips
Like a dream baby, it's like a dream
I feel the touch of your sweet caress
Like a dream baby, it's like a dream
I feel your body close to mine
Como un sueño baby
Just like a dream
Boy you know that you should be mine
Como un sueño baby
Just like a dream
I know it's true
Whenever I'm with you
I feel a kiss from your sweet lips
Like a dream baby, it's like a dream
I feel the touch of your sweet caress
Like a dream baby, it's like a dream
I feel your body close to mine
Como un sueño baby
Like a dream
Boy you know that you should be mine
Como usueno
Como usueno
Love of my dreams
You are my everything
Please never go
Like a dream baby, just like a dream
Like a dream baby, just like a dream
