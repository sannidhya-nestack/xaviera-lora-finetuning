I carry the dance in my blood
I've always been this way
My life is in the milonga
And I shall follow this road all my days
I never wanted to love only one
That's why many affairs I've known
My destiny I have gambled
And if I've lost, I'll pay and go
A rebel I am who always breaks free from the chains of love
I fly with the wind at my back
I arrive, make love and move on
Like a loose dino-champ, a beast and wind steps very hard on me
I don't know how to love
My love has gone
I'll dance throughout life with my soul
My girl Marina she's a fly Latina have you seen her?
Met her in Argentina doing shows at the theater
She said she's down with hip hop and wants to learn the culture
I started teaching her elements till we got closer
She started singing songs I started rapping to her
And then I hit up BoxED so we could mix the two up
This is it now we got tangueras hopping
Some steady rocking pop locking keeping speakers knocking
With the club jumpin' and the DJ cuttin'
So stop frontin', get on the floor and just move somethin'
So where's my people at? Let's see you do somethin'
Sometimes memories with a mercy come to wet my eyes
And bring again from a distance his passion and painful lie
So I pull myself together and whisper as I pray
My life is in the milonga, I know I'll dance my life away
Girl now it's my turn
Now watch me switch the sample
And flip my tango to different angles to this rectangle
I know you still love me
Why won't you just admit it
Girl just quit it
You know to music I'm so committed
I stay spittin' and flows
Stay rockin' them shows
Stay makin' that dough and on the road
I like the things you're doin'
Your voice is so soothing
I'm hypnotized by the way you move to rectangle music
So just do it, just do it
Come on, come on, come on
A rebel I am who always breaks free from the chains of love
I fly with the wind at my back
I arrive, make love and move on (why don't you show me)
Like a loose bail or jump up is someone steps very hard on me
I don't know how to love
My love has come
I'll dance throughout life with my song
I'll dance throughout life with my song
Soul
