I step out on a brand new stage
Heart pounding in the light
I wonder if they'll feel my fears
Or if I'll shine tonight
I'm gonna glow, I'm gonna grow
Nothing's gonna hold me down
This is my time, watch me climb
I'm ready to stand my ground
I used to hide behind my dreams
Afraid I'd get them wrong
But now I see the power in me
I've had it all along
I'm gonna glow
I'm gonna grow
Nothing's gonna hold me down
This is my time
Watch me climb
I'm ready to stand my ground
Each step makes me stronger
Each note in my own song
I'm trusting in my story
Where I truly belong
I'm gonna blow
I'm gonna grow
Nothing's gonna hold me down
This is my time
Watch me climb, I'm ready to stand my ground
