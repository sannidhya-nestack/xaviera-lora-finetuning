Mmm, mmm
How I love to see you dance to the rhythm you assume
Your imaginary band underneath the moon
Day to day I will pretend I'm in the ordinary loom
Just to do it all again
Underneath the moon
I hate the hours in between
All those ordinary things
Hating the light of day
And wanting the dark to stay
They don't ever have to know
So we don't ever have to stop
Solamente la luna siempre
Oh, I love your sweet embrace
The desperation you exude
While you cling into my waist
Underneath them
I could go without sleeping forever
Until my body breaks (Until your body breaks)
I love the minute that we start
To feel the pounding of your heart
Hating the light of day
And wanting the dark to stay
They don't ever have to know
So we don't ever have to stop
Solamente en la luna siempre
En mis sueños te veo, te veo
I hate the hours in between
All those ordinary things
It ain't a lot of days
You know ain't a lot to stay
They don't ever have to know
So we don't ever have to stop
Solamente la luna siempre
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da-da-da-ba-ba-ba-ba da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-ba-ba-ba-ba da-da-da-da-da-da-ba-ba-ba da-da-da-da-da-da-ba-ba da-da-da-da-ba-ba da-da-da
