In the river is Osun
From June to June
The sister, the goddess, the moon
Check it out now
No saddle
These sisters in the boat
They like to paddle
Flowin' in the boat, flowin' in the canoe
The aura got a point man
What up, I thought you knew
Don't et the tradition that's inside of you
Ooh, watchin' news, watchin' news, watchin' news check it out the crew
El Canal este la pausa, tiene punta y no le roza
One says yes and well the other says no
El Paray no me habla, pero a mi coco me importa
Listen to me down Ecuador folk tales it go like this, it go
It go like this
It go like this
Listen to the story, listen to how they paddle
The glory, Oshun in the moon
Oh man if I don't see he missing the jaw
When you push the oar, he makes a sound, he's hella, hella, Paul
He grunts and moans, you know he just wants to be shown
The respect that everybody else is shown
I'm the spirit of the voice and sound that you make put to ore
Transition, fuck your rendition
You make no sound, then I'll be no more
Understand that I'm dipping in the swimming and living and loving in the waters of a shoon
Checking out here and out'cause any day, any minute now, I could be gone soon
So I quiver, move with the river, rise and deliver, shiver, wanna keep living on
I tell that girl now get it get it girl now pass it along pass it along pass it along
Lord let the old man speak
Past, present, future, never be weak
