Hey Felicia, te amo
Tu eres mi destino
The sound you hear's the five-o
Sirens in our barrio
Hey Felicia, that's no cure
For that wounded heart of yours
Try to fill the hole in your soul
Careful you don't overdose
Ghetto bird hovers over us
Calling in for more backup
Won't be long'til they arrive
Play it wrong you won't survive
Hey Felicia, it's too soon
You were born to make men swoon
No one wants to see you lose
the needle is wound
Hey Felicia, hey Felicia
Heavily shot
They are born
Good rats and the alley cats
Time to leave them in the past
Romeos and dead end roads
Time to bid them adios
Hey Felicia, te amo
Duet es mi destino
The sound you hear is the five o'clock
Sirens in our body, oh hey Felicia
Hey Felicia
Hey Felicia
Hey Felicia take my hand
