Aha! Have we met before? Maybe. How about say you look divine, dear? Thank you. Shall we dance? To you, nothing is sacred, is sacred, aha! To you, nothing is sacred, is sacred, aha!
Nothing is sacred and sacred I have to you
Nothing is sacred everything evolves to you
Nothing is sacred everything evolves
Awaken to the thought of you
The vision I need to pursue
Yet again (that's right)
Embracing such a sweet taboo
I have fallen for you
Once again
Awaken to the thought of you
What you say and what you do, oh, oh
Awaken to the thought of you (awaken to the thought of you)
And I didn't regret what I do (awaken to the thought of you)
What were you saying my dear?
Who's the fool? You or me? Hard to tell
Who will win? You or me? I guess we'll see
If you're as good as you say
You'll have your way
If you're as good as you say
You'll have your way
Spoken truth I never knew
Inside has changed my view
Once again
Awakened to the thought so true
You could be my destiny
I'll never leave the red dress
Never waking to that sweet taboo, babe
I love you, yeah
Awaken to the thought of the years (what you doing, babe?)
Awaken to the thought of the years (okay, hold it there)
Awaken to the thought of you, I have found (do you like the little ones?)
It's something like this again (no, yeah) nothing is the same again
I'm just going for a little walk, my dear. It's too cold out for a walk. I'll keep you warm.

Awaken to the thought of you and what you say and what you do, yeah
Just click your heels together. Showers some night. That's right
Awaken to the thought of you, what you say and what you do (what do you say, what do you say, what do you do) (awaken to the thought of you, what you say and what you do) (awaken to the thought of what you say and what you do) (awaken to the thought everything I call) (what do you say, what do you say, what do you do) (awaken to the thought you say and what you do)
What you say and what you do (I'll tell you)
I'll wake up to the fact that (I'll tell you)
I'll watch you say that (I'll tell you)
I'll wake up to the fact that (I'll tell you)
We'll be wearing your red dress, you say (I'll tell you)
Nothing is that great (I'll tell you)
