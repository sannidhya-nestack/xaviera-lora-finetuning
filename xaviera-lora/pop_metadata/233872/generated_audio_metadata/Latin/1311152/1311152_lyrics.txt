We are working as a star
If we are right always fighting each other's side
And after time there's no start
I know I love you even though I say it's sad
And I've been following all my love, all my love, all my love, all my loving
And I've been following all my love, all my love, all my love, all my loving
Right now you can't kill my lies
I said it out, I'm not in on you but
I love you though I'm a star
I keep on need to spider buddy
Now I'm saying
And I feel swallowed right now
The moon and the hills right now
The ground and the sea
And I can follow my love all day, all my love all day, I just love you
