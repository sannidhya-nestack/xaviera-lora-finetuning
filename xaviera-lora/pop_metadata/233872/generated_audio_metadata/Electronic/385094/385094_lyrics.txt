There's something wrong
If I'm a giver and I'm poor like a bum
Need some bread and all I have is a crumb
What I do seems to be a chain to a machine
Reciprocating, a type of slavery
For now my robot brain
Tries to hide my emotions
I go insane
Going through the motions
Going through the motions
There's something wrong
Oh I allow you to walk all over me
Sustain the discipline to give you what you need
It's a job to give you what you want to hear
It's a job how you want me to appear
So now my robot brain
Tries to hide my emotions
I go insane
Going through the motions
Going through the motions
Going through the motions
9 to 5, 9 to 6, 9 to 7, 9 to 8, 9 to 9, 10, 11, 12
There's something wrong because I let you walk all over me
'Cause I let you walk all over me
I let you walk all over me (There's something wrong)
There's something wrong, there's something wrong
There's something wrong, there's something wrong
There's something wrong, there's something wrong
There's something wrong, there's something wrong with me
