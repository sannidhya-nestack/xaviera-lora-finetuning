Tonight, the world will crumble all around us
And in my darkest hour, you're all I could ever need
Tonight, the world will be lost to those around us
I say my goodbyes as we close our eyes
As the world stops revolving
I look into your eyes
As the world stops revolving
I'm glad it's you by my side
As the world stops revolving
We have such little time
As the world stops revolving
I found love at the end of the line
Friends are all gone
Slowly fading away
Their smiling faces
And now echoes of the past from red to green
The lights are left far behind
The future is now uncertain
But how can I be that free?
As the world starts moving, I look into your eyes
As the world starts moving, I'm glad it's real by my side (I look into your eyes, I see your eyes)
We've all been added to your mind
I feel alone and we'll never know
Sounds and lights surround where we lay
And voices echo across the heavy haze
And the crackle of fire
In twisted metal we were lost within the wreckage of one another
It's overriding something, it's a deadly call
And as I held her hand in my own
I knew I had felt her love
Yet as quickly as she had entered my life
The world stopped its turn
For us alone
I look into your eyes, I look into your eyes, I look into your eyes, I look into your eyes, I look into your eyes, I look into your eyes, I look into your eyes, I look into your eyes
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Our love at the end of the line
As the world starts revolving
I look into your eyes
As the world starts revolving
I'm glad it's you by my side
As the world starts revolving
We have such little time
As the world starts revolving
I found love at the end of the line
I look into your eyes
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
