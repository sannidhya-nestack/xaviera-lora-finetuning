You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I, you and i, you and I
The sun goes down and I'm rising up
Night is just beginning
All the stars are turning to dust
We still have a night away
There's no time, there's no rush
I'll see you every night and day
What I have will be enough
To prove you I can make you stay
You and I will be together
There's nothing I can do when you call my name
You and I will live forever yeah
Tomorrow we will do it again
You and I will be together
There's nothing I can do when you call my name
You and I will live forever yeah
Tomorrow we will do it again
Tomorrow we will do it again
The sun goes down and I'm rising up
Night is just beginning
All the stars are turning to dust
We still have a night away
There's no time, there's no rush
I'll see you every night and day
What I have will be enough
To prove you I can make you stay
You and I will be together
There's nothing I can do when you call my name
You and I will live forever yeah
Tomorrow we will do it again
You and I will be together
There's nothing I can do when you call my name
You and I will live forever, yeah
Tomorrow we will do it again
Tomorrow we will do it again
You and I will be together
You and I will live forever, yeah
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
