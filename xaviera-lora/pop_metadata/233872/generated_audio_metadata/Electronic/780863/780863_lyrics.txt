I never thought I'd ever see again
A girl that made me feel like this would never end
I never felt before the way you move me girl
I never, I never, I never
I wanna be the one to take your hand and say
I'll always be the one to take your breath away
I wanna be the man to make you feel it girl
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
One in a million, baby, that you'd be here tonight
One in a million, girl, that my eyes would lock into your soul tight
Oh, can you feel it, baby? It never felt so right
You're one in a million, girl, so just let me be your number one tonight
It's like I need a girl from another time
It's like we met before in another life
Do you believe a girl? Do you feel it too?
Well do ya, do ya, do ya?
Do you feel it girl when you move your hips?
Yeah I can feel it too when you touch your lips
Yeah it's the way you move I never seen before
I never, I never, I never
One in a million, baby, that you'd be here tonight
One in a million, girl, that my eyes would lock into yours so tight
Oh, can you feel it, baby? It never felt so right
You're one in a million, girl, so just let me be your number one tonight
So show me your world tonight
I'll give you my love tonight
So show me your world
you're the only one I wanna be with
One in a million baby
That you'd be here tonight
One in a million, girl, that my eyes will lock into yours so tight
Oh, can you feel it, baby? It never felt so right
You're one in a million, girl, so just let me be your number one tonight
One in a million, baby
That you'd be here tonight
One in a million girl that my eyes would lock until you're so tight
Oh can you feel it baby it never felt so right
You're one in a million girl so just let me be your number one tonight
