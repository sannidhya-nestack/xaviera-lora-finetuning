So naked
Sometimes I just want to see you behind me
In the bathroom mirror
And sometimes I just want to feel your outline
Spooning mine under the sheets
Sometimes I just
Want to squeeze you from inside of me
And feel you spiral up through my spine
Sometimes I just want to play circus games
And feel tiny trickles, sweet sweet droplets
Beat down my spine or fall from your face into mine
Sometimes I just want to see teeth marks, flesh squeeze, skin stretch under your poor grip
To the sound of bed-linen rip (to the sound of bed-linen rip)
Sometimes I just want to feel in the dark
Your chest rise with each breath
To know that you are alive
Sometimes I just want to feel
The crispness of your inhale
The warmth of your exhale
Tickle the tiny hairs on the back of my neck
Sometimes I just want to stay
In blank meditative silence
Strip you of your body flesh
And with my soul stand before you
And that is all that I am
Soul naked before you
Soul naked before you
Soul naked before you
Sometimes I just want to see you
Sometimes I just want to feel you
And sometimes I just want to stand so naked before you
Sometimes I just want to feel you
And sometimes
I just wanna see you sometimes
I just wanna feel deep inside of me
That is all that I am
That is all that I am
So naked before you
That is all that I am
So naked before you (so naked before you)
So naked before (so naked before you)
So naked before you (so naked before you)
Sometimes I would just be happy
In any one of these moments to die
