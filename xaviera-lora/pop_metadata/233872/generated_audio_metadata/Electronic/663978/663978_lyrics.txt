Dim the mount
Turn it off
Dim the lights
Oh, oh, oh
I know I was wrong
Now I see we don't belong
When we love
When you dim these lights
Dim them out, turn it off
Dim the lights, oh, oh, oh
I feel it is wrong
And I know you are so far gone
When we love
When you dim these lights
Then I'm out, turn it off
Dim the lights
You are so far gone
Then I'm out, turn it off
Dim the lights
You are so far gone
