(Vocalizing)
We float through mountaintops
We grow now we won't stop
Fisted out of breath
So close almost
See the morning light
Sun is out we will be fine
We float through mountaintops
We grow now we won't stop
Face death out of breath
So close almost see the morning light
Sun is out we will be fine
So why won't we take time
Take time, take time, take time, take time
The beat is taking over
Can't we find some closure
Why won't we take time
Take time, take time
See the morning light
Sun is out we will be fine
So why won't we take time
Take time, take time
To listen carefully and rewind
It feels good on me
Rewind and rewind and rewind
And rewind, yeah, to listen carefully
Rewind, it feels good on me
Rewind and rewind, and rewind, and rewind
So why won't we take some time now
So why won't we take some time now
To listen carefully and rewind it feels good on me
Rewind and rewind and rewind and rewind
