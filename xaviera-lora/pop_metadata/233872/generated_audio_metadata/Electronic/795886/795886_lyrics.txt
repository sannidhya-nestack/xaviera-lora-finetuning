I look into that mirror and holy smokes
I can't remember seeing a face that looked so good
Oh yeah
It's real hard looking for someone who deserves this
For tonight
I think you'll do
It might be alarming
I can't help but feel so damn charmed
I hope she's not got fallen in love with this right here
Words are just words they're not supposed to be so sincere
Oh yeah
Playing ain't as easy as you might think
But hey baby
What do you drink?
It might be alarming
I can't help it, he ain't so damn charming
Really? He couldn't stop talking about himself
Okay, I get it, you're cool
The bee's knees kept me up, babe
I think we hit it off though
Do you think he'll call me?
I can't help it, you got the abs on me
I know it's tough
I'ma end it babe
I'ma end it but I'ma end it
End it babe
End it babe
I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it
It might be alarming
I can't help
I'm so damn darned
