Got a smile, it's a rainy day
Fights on hold, they say that's okay
Raindrops fallin' but I don't mind
Love's deferred but I'm feelin' fine
Ooh, call me crazy but it's true
Wait impatient just for you
Snows will pass and skies will clear
Keep this rain check holding here
I got a rain check on love
Saving it for when skies above
Are blue again we're dancing the light
Holding on to this love tight
Hearts like thunder, but that's alright
Umbrellas up through darkest night
Harnesses in every draw
Raincheck means we never stop
Hold on tight, love's on delay
I'm so lost, I'm gonna find our way
Through the clouds and pouring rain
This rain check takes away the pain
I got a rain check on blow
Savin' it for what skies above
Our blue again will dance in the light
Holding on to this love tight
Hold on tight love's on delay
But soon the sun will find our way
Through the clouds and pouring rain
This rain check takes away the pain
I got a rain check on love
Saving it from what skies above
I'll prove again what there's in the light
Holding on to this love tight
