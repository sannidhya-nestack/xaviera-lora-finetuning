My love, I left them
On the top of that high hill
My love, I lost them
When they chopped up my hill
My love, my love, I drowned out
When I swam way out too far
Now see a dark shadow in my right eye
Now, I'm wide awake when that door comes deeper and deeper
I clear my brain, I clear my brain
My love, I cracked down when I fell down the floor
My love, my love, I smashed it
When I thought it was a door
Now, see a dark shadow in my right eye
Now, wide awake when that door comes deeper and deeper
Now, see a dark shadow in my right eye
Now, I'm wide awake when that dog comes deeper and deeper
