Music box, music box, music box, music box, music box
Can you imagine my frustration?
Constant worry, no concentration
This was supposed to be real fun
Feel like I'm lost before I've begun
It comes down to simple mechanics
Don't look for hidden semantics
This music box is more than just
An old collectible collecting dust
I don't wanna hurt, neither deny
This broken good, it gets me up inside
I face my demon every show
But still he never wants to let me go
I'm the five, I have no way of me down
So lift me out this misery and let me go (go, go, go)
A music box, a music box
A music box, a music box
Feelings self-embraced but undisclosed
Running round in my oblivion like no one knows
Once learned now otten as a new cruel trick
No time to be deviant I must take care
Of every little part of me that got me here
Automatic laughter for these hypocrites
Try to get it through your heads
I try to get it through your heads
I'm wide awake now
I don't wanna hurt night after night
This broken building eats me up inside
I face my demons every show
Still he never wants to let me go
And the flight I have now wears me down
The flight I have now wears me down
To hold the attention of distracted crowds
Oh,'cause I'm wide awake now
Oh,'cause I'm wide awake now
The music that I know fills me, the rhythm that I know soothes me
I question every part of me that put me here
Running round in my oblivion, the fight I have now wears me down
The times I need to change, but there was no time to wait now
The music that I know fills me, the rhythm that I know soothes me
I question every part of me that put me here
Running round in my oblivion, the fight I have now wears me down
The times I need to change, but there was no time to wait now
I don't wanna hurt, not tonight (I don't wanna hurt, I don't wanna hurt, I don't wanna hurt)
I face my demons every show (I don't wanna hurt, not tonight, not tonight, not tonight)
I have no words to beat down
The flies, I have no words to beat down
All the attention of distracted crowds
Pulls him wide awake now
Pulls him wide awake now
Pulls him wide awake now
