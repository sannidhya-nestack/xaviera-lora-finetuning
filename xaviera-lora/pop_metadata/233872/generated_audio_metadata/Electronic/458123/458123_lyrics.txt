How long do I have to hurt you
Till you give up resisting
If I can't find the words to
I'll just resort back to the old fist in the face
Won't you cry? Won't you cry?
Drama Queen
Now you're playing this game again
You ought to know that I can stand it
Pretty soon
Things began out of hand
And I don't know if you can handle
Love to hate you
The way you bow your head and smile
Every day a little more
The middle cuts will start bleeding soon enough
But then inside, they're still festering and sore
How long do I have to hurt you
Till you give up resisting
If I can find the words to
I'll just resort back to the old fist in the face
But won't you cry
Won't you cry
You're all grown up, so why don't you try act like an adult
And hold on to your own decisions
Don't you dare blame me for the gap between reality
And the dreamy life that you envisioned
What's with that word now?
You better shove it down your throat girl
Don't you ever pose that question
You're gonna stay with me right until your death
We'll do its part, the way it's done by decent Christians
