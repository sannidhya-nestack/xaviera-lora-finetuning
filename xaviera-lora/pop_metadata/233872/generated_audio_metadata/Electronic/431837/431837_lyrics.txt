Once upon a time, two individuals shared the same experience
Yet each was unaware of the other's existence
"No one could be like me," the brown eye softly said
"No one," the blue eyes whispered
And so it was
Until something magical happened
Something that would help them understand
That everything you have experienced in the past
Only prepared you for what follows
Now
Come aboard, be the railway's son
When we're born, wake at four
Get away, where you hide, one more
Stay away, one more ticket to pleasure grave, one more
Cloud away, one more step
Come aboard, run the railways son
I watch you hide
Eyes so soft to me
But I can't abide
Where you hide
And it's one long stairway
One more ticket to reason away
One more feeling
One more please, I'm cold
I'm cold
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(audience applauding)
