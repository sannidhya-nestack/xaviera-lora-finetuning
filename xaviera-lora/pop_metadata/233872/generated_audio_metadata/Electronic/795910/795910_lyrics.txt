I'm at a loss for words
Because you look so damn good
You're staring right through my soul
And I can't hide anymore
You made me hot with desire
Though I can feel the fire
It's time to see where this goes
And to get up off the floor
Wish I could never let you et me
Wish I could never let you et me
Tomorrow may never come
If we don't let today go
It's our time to shine and I can feel it now
I want to keep this thing going
But first I need your number
I hope you don't write me off as just some other guy
Wish I could never let you et me
Wish I could never let you et me
Wish I could never let you et me
Wish I could never let you et me
Wish I could never let you et me
Wish I could never let you et me
Wish I could never let you et me
Wish I could never let you et me
You wish I could just never let you rock and do your work on me
You wish I could just never let you rock and do your work on me
You wish I could just never let you rock and be your work on me
You wish I could just never let you rock and do your work on me
You wish I could deserve you
Let you rock and leave you anic
You wish I could deserve you
Let you rock and leave you anic
