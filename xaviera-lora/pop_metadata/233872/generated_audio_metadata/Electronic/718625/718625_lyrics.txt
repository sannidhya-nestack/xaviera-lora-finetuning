What to do when it doesn't leave
Thought alone, start losing sleep
But you and me, we were meant to be
We know you're everything
Keep holding on to me
Tell me I'm the only way back to what it was
Lovin' isn't great
But it's the only way we can get it right
Break down
Do the things we never would've believed
Open up now
For the ones who said it wasn't meant to be
It's blind love
In the shadows of a lonely night
Blind love
Always twenty twenty in hindsight
It's blind love
My love, what to do when the feelings stay?
Left alone, I can't fall asleep
How I'm feeling, I should've stayed
It's a love I can't put away
Keep holding on me
Your lovin's getting heavy, getting heavy on my soul
Lovin isn't free
But you have been the only thing I know
Break down
Do the things we never would've believed
Open up now
For the ones that said it wasn't meant to be
It's blind love
In the shadows of the longing eyes
Blind love
Always twenty-twenty and out in sight
Keep hugging on a knee
Keep hugging on a knee
Keep holding on to me
Keep holding on to me
It's blind love
In the shadows of a longing night
Blind love
Always twenty-twenty and out of sight
Blind love
Always hard when we say goodbye
Blind love
It's when you don't have to think twice
It's my life
