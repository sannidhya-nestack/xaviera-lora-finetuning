To the core
Wake you up
Wake you up
Wake you up
Wake you up
Wake you up
Wake you up
Moving towards the future you can't bear
You've become the cynic
Self-defeating and frozen to the core
When you wake from this coma I'll be here
I just want you back from the dead
Light the matches, just light the matches and start the fire
Gonna make you feel something again
Light the matches, just light the matches and start the fire
Gonna make you feel something again
Wake you up, wake you up
We all have a single voice, better make the right choice
Don't wanna ever waste it, waste it
Finding yourself in a void, is any bit of joy enough
We all have a single voice
Better make the right choice
Don't wanna ever waste it, waste it, oh
Finding yourself in a void
Is any bit of joy enough to wake you up
Feel something again
When you wake from this coma I'll be here
I just want you back from the dead
When you wake from this coma I'll be here
I just want you back from the dead
When you wake from this coma I'll be here
I just want you back from the dead
When you wake from this coma I'll be here
I just want you back from the dead
Wake you up
Wake you up
Wake you up
Wake you up
