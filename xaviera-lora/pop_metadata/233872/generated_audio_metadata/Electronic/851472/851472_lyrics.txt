We're on the way to perfection
Always long way for, for the better
We're on the way to perception
Never doubting, that's what matters
Expect a lifelong happiness
Therapists clean up the mess
Searching for delivery
Expansion is a new religion
We're on the way to perfection
Always longing for the better
We're on the way to perception
Never doubt it, that's what matters
We're on the way to perfection, always long way forward
For the vector
We're on the way
To perception
So never doubt it
That's what matters
