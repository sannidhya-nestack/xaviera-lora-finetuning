Ask you run
Ask you run
Run, run, as fast as you can
You can't catch me, I'm gingerbread man
The gingerbread man
You can't catch me, I'm gingerbread man
The gingerbread man
English traditional
With a gingerbread smile
English traditional
Run, run, as fast as you can
Jump on my back, jump on my back
and I'll take you across the river.
Jump on my back and I'll take you across the river.
So the gingerbread man put himself up and stood on the fox's head,
And stood on the fox's head,
And was never seen again.
And was never seen again
