Let me kiss you baby on the floor
Let me kiss you baby like we used to before
Let me take you out on our ride
Help each other through those long dark nights
Let me kiss a baby on the floor
Let me kiss a baby that's what girls do for
Let me take you out and make it all alright
How could you ever think those long dark nights?
