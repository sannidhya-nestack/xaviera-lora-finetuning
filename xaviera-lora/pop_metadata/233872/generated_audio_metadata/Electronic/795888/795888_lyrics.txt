When I was younger I saw you in a dream
Told me of our future and how we will be
I didn't worry, I knew our time would come
Or an angel sent from God above?
Time, there will never be enough
Words can last so long
And this is what I give up
And I don't wanna wake up
I
Wish it were easier
Expressing these things to you
Finding a way
To tell you these things inside
So educating
Dreams are the reason for you and I
Time, there will never be enough
Words can last so long
If this is what I give up
Then I don't want to wake up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
