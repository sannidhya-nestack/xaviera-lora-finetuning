Radios playing, nerves alive, why so many lies in the air?
Thought your truth always be the start of the great
Thought you were so me, finishing my sentences, lighting up my every sentence
I'm dancing so as not to die
Dancing so as not to die
Dancing dancing not to die
Dancing dancing not to die
I'm dancing so as not to die
Dancing so as not to die
Dancing dancing not to die
Dancing dancing not to die
Radio's louder, I try to et
We're both sick of experiences we can't give
Each other, that's the way it's turned out
I'll be the one to go,'cause I'm feeling you like I feel it in me
I'm dancing so as not to die, dancing so as not to die
Dancing, dancing not to die, dancing, dancing not to die
I'm dancing so as not to die
Dancing so as not to die
Dancing, dancing not to die
Dancing, dancing not to die
Turn up the volume
Drown me in the sound
Heart beat, heart pound
Who needs a man?
Turn up the volume
Drown me in the sound
Heart beat, heart pound
Who needs a man?
Turn up the volume, draw me in the sound
Heartbeat, heart pound, who needs a man?
Turn up the volume, draw me in the sound
Heartbeat, heart pound, who needs a man

You are on my mind
I am wondering if we were the ones, unkind
Or if life had given us a hard time
In the mirror, I catch my cold stare
Keep thinking of the love that lives nowhere
I'm dancing soon as not today
Dancing so as not today
Dancing dancing not today
Dancing dancing not today
I'm dancing soon as not today
Dancing so as not today
Dancing dancing not today
Dancing dancing not today
Feeling you like I
Feel it in me
Feeling you like I
Feel it in me
Feeling you like I
Feel it in me
Feeling you like I
I feel it in me
Radio stopped
You are on my mind
Radio stopped
You are on my mind
Radio stopped
You are on my mind
