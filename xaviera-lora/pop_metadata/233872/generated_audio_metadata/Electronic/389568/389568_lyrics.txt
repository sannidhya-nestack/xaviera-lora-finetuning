Check the chick out, riding in my car
Is it fate?
Got a weapon that I know will take me far
Is it fate?
Fenty shades so you can see my face
Is it fate?
Could you see it's open doors to any place?
Is it fate?
Is it fate?
White walls driving me to top town
Step to messy schools clubbing town
Back to town I look just like a clown
Till this rocket takes off from the ground
Money talks, we told to sing a song
Money talks, money makes the mall
We'll be all around, listen to the urban underground
Tell me, is it fair?
Let me tell you straight
There's nothing you can do about it
There's nothing you can do about it
There's nothing left but to take your fate
This one world you can bite on the plate
Is it fate?
Transaction law you wear your soulmate
Well, is it fate?
Was it fate?
Skin of colour never closes doors
Just as long as you get the cash from all
This is what a woman or a doll
This is why you're fighting for the role
Always leaving suckers wanting more
Taking down all you hit on the floor
It's difficult to fuck you up for sure
Sure it's fate
Number one is where you elevate
I believe in dreams so cool does it create
Take every babe and drop out of the date
I'm a queen, cars and phone and K-estate
Hey mom, pictures and a man on tape
Work your ass off, seven years just wait
That's your dream of things that you create
One brother wants to be your mate
Tell me
Is it fair? Let me tell you straight
There is nothing you can do about it
There is nothing you can do about it
Tell me
Is it fair? Let me tell you straight
There is nothing you can do about it
There is nothing you can do about it
There is nothing left but to take your things
