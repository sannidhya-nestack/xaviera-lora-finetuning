Tryna hide down busy streets
Movin' free without a plan
Leave my footprints in the sand
Is it possible? (possible)
I'm afraid, I'm escaping, I'm hoping nothing will break me
Leave a mark in my own hand
Is it possible? (possible)
Wasting time and filling space
Walking round until nobody else
Just waiting for you to get it done
So I can call your name
So I can see you
So I can hold you
Trying to hide in my busy streets
Moving free without a plan
Leave my footprints in the sand
Is it possible, possible?
I'm afraid, I'm escaping and hoping nothing will break me
Even marking my own hunt
Is it possible, possible?
