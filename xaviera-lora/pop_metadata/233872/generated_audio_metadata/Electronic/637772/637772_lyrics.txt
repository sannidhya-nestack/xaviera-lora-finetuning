We ran dry, we blew through the money last night
And sold all the memories this morning
And said goodbye to the town that we were born in
Here, bury all of the evidence here
We'll drive'til the memory fades to nowhere
We'll call you on the day we finally get there
You can't go back
You can do anything else but you can't go back
You can't go back
You can do anything else but you can't go back
All of the wilderness hides
All of the looking back over your shoulder
We'll catch up with you before the night is over
You can't go back
You can do anything else but you can't go back
Carry me
Carry me across the secret river to the other side
Where the children swear and the lovers hide
Past names of the broken hearted carved on station walls
Who are nothing more than a hidden door
I woke up, I lost you a mile or two back
You slipped the ring from your finger, I called your name out
I'll see you on the day they pass the blame out
Carry me
Carry me over endless gardens where we were secure
Till the love we owned turned to stone
Carry me
Carry me over the mountains to the city lights
Where ghosts like us hide in the night
I carry me across the secret river to the other side
Where the children swear and the lovers hide
All the names of the broken hearted carved on station walls
Who are nothing more than a hidden door
