Orbit faster
Slate to master
Great remorse
Instant chemistry
Sheer deception
Watch me enter
Just a little bit
Too high, don't have a cap
In the devil, right inside you
He will find you, taking lives from you
Try to fight it, down the water
Too high, your blood is dripping
Instant death in me
I'll be faster
Slate to master
Drink
Life's a hire
Cold as oranges
Rolling over me
Broken isles, solemn trials
Deaths are turning out to my enemies
East of blood, back you're born
Degradation, weight of sanity
Put your hands down, it's late at night, it's time to go home, it's late at night, it's time to go home
Right inside you, he will find you
Speaking nicely, try to fight it
Turn the water into your bloodstream
Instant death you need
