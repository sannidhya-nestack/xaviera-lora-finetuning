All I wanna be is happy
All I wanna be is happy
We go round and round looking for people and places
To fill our hearts, to fill our souls
All I wanna be
All I wanna be is happy where I am
All I wanna be is with someone who cares
All I wanna be is happy in my own head
All I wanna do is live with no regrets
We go round and round, we go round and round
We go round and round, we go round and round
We go round and round, all I wanna be is happy
