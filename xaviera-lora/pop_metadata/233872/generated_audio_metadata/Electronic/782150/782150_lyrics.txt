Ooh-ah
When I think of the love you gave
It turns my world around
And other times just like pouring rain
You left me drenched in doubt
And on and on I'm spinning round
My mind, my love, my soul
Vertigo, my heart's in a vertigo
And I don't know where to go
I'm stuck in a vertigo with you
The last time we said goodbye
Your touch upon my lips
I still feel it every time I think about that kiss
So I just lie to myself and say it never meant a thing
But I just cannot deny what's real
The love, the pain, the sting
And I fall, I fall, I'm losing all my balance and control
Vertigo, my heart's in a vertigo
And I don't know where to go
I'm stuck in a vertigo with you
And I wanna, wanna disappear
The picture always reappears
It's time that I let you go
I turn and you're right there
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Vertigo
My heart's in a vertigo
And I don't know where to go
I'm stuck in a vertigo with you
Vertigo, my heart's in a vertigo
And I don't know where to go
I'm stuck in a vertigo with you
I'm stuck in a vertigo with you
