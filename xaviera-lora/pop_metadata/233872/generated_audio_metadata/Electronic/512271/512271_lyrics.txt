I just want you to think of me when you go to sleep
And fantasize of things that scare you so
Aren't you just a little bit afraid of what might happen
When we get together and explode
'Cause you're unbelievable
Just unachievable to me
You just feel like gold
The purest thing on earth
Makes me say these words to you
You just feel like gold
Do you want me to hold you close
And touch you where it shows
And let your mind go freely now
Never ending and sending thoughts across the sky
And share this night and then we take a bow
'Cause you're unbelievable, just incredible to me
You just feel like gold, the purest gold
Makes me sing these words to you, you, you just feel like gold
You just feel like gold
You are unbelievable, just unachievable to me
You just feel like gold
The purest thing on earth makes me sing
You just feel like, you just feel like, you just feel like a girl (you just feel like, you just feel like, you just feel like)
You just feel like a
I just want you to think of me
Just want you to think of me
Just want you to think of me, me, me
You just feel like a
I just want you to think of me
