He was a man of peace to me
For that I was a woman of his own kind
Keep on running, talking at me
Keep on trying, holding you
Just to take and taste my thing
I don't know, that is what I do
Keep running, keep running
Keep running around the world
Keep hiding, keep shouting, keep trying, go on more
I, I, I, I, I, I, love him, he loves me more than I love him
Keep on running, talking and then keep on trying
Destiny takes and takes tomorrow
I don't know that is what I do
Keep running, keep running
Keep running around the world
Keep hiding, keep shutting
Keep trying, go on
I, I, I, I, I love you
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Ikale, ikale, ikale, ikale, ikale
