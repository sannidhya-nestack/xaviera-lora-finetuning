I struggle on the road to evening
This is my time to breathe
A washing light and pounding in headaches
Till we drown in evening haze
If our waves don't crash together
I want vapor in the breeze
Can't stay in shape forever
I won't share your lonely weather
Because you know you're away with me
Because you know you're away with me
Through the dark, through the neon bleed
You, you, you wait with me
These veiled streets hold back confessions
Words too heavy to perceive
A midnight waltz of love and loathing
We're still dancing in this maze
If our waves don't crash together
I want vapor in the breeze
Can't stay in shape forever
I won't share your lonely weather
In fact, you'll know your way with me
Because you'll know your way with me
Through the dark, through the knee of man
Thought I'd know your way with me
But you already knew how this ends
But you already knew how this ends
I knew how this'd end
A struggle on the road to evening
This is my time to breathe
This is my time to breathe
This is my time to breathe
