Suddenly you're wise, suddenly you're wise
Here's to the night we felt alive
Suddenly you're wise, here's to the night we felt alive
Never thought, I never thought, I never thought
Suddenly you're wise
Here's to the night we felt alive
Suddenly you're wise
Here's to the night we felt alive
These days you might feel
The light makes its way across your face
These days you might feel
The shafts of time
These days you might feel love
These days you might, these
These days you might feel the light makes its way across your face
My heart could be, my heart could be so
My heart could be so
Mmm, never thought my heart could be so, so
I never thought my heart could be so, so
I never thought my heart could beat
I never heard my heart could, oh
I never thought my heart could beat
These days you might feel the light
Never thought my heart
I never thought my heart could beat
So, so, I never thought my
I never thought my heart, I never thought my heart could be, mm-mm-mm
Makes its way across your face, mm-mm
I don't remember growing older, I don't, I don't, I don't
These days you might feel the light make its way across your face
These days you might feel the light make its way across your face
