You've been bleeding me, bleeding me dry
And now out goes the tide
Sweeping me to the other side
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
As I stare into the eyes of death
A singing wind of mercy I caress
The eyes, I can feel them watch me die
As I dress myself for the last dance
The spirit tells me I've gone second best
It owns my ego
As life slips away from my cold hands
It gravitates towards your void demands
It's time for you to dance
Cut the strings from my puppeteers
And let me levitate above my fears
Like you, like you
The premonitions I did not obey
Catastrophic consequence we pay
We are candles flicker in the shadows
My sentiments are lost in sound
They're grinding me, grinding me into the ground
Gripping onto my last pound of flesh
The wailing sirens I cannot contest
Divide, the world has only seen one side
Let out my, let out my ego
Oh dear god, tell god damn why can't I just et
Take me anywhere, anywhere but here
