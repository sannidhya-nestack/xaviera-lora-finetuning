There's a moment of clarity
Right before your taking
Leaving all the loved ones shaken
Leaving me with faith forsaken
Screaming and fighting just won't do
Clinging to the ghost in you
Suddenly the world seems more strange
No rhyme, no reason, no cause, no change
An empty solution left me estranged
Waiting and waiting for something new
Longing for the ghost within you
And I believe in fate
I do
Wanting things to go my way
Things will no matter what I say it's true
And I believe in the ghost in you
More universe in my philosophy will allow
A great solution but I can't see how
At the end of the day I want it now
Dreaming and hoping that it's all true
Waiting for the ghost in you
And I believe in fate
I do
Wanting things to go my way
Things will, no matter what I say
It's true
And I believe
In the ghost in you
It's innocence, innocence
I can say it's defense
We all know better
We all know better
Nothing ever comes to you
Longing for a flicker that can still deceive you
I'm longing for the purpose to see you
