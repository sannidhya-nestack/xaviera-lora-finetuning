Your fever is so damn high
My fear is burning, want to fly
You push my mind to the moon
I don't know what the hell to do
My eyes are closed, you scream my name
I'm shaking, don't feel the same
I don't know anything that's happening
That's happening
You push and shove around this world
In my own mind I'm separating
I see your face in my dreams
What the hell is happening?
My eyes are closed you scream my name
I'm shaking don't feel the same
I don't know anything that's happening
That's happening
From the cradle to the grave
Life's changes aren't all the same
I feel the bleeding in my heart
You pull the blade and it all starts
My eyes are closed and scream my name
I'm shaking, don't feel the same
I don't know anything that's happening, that's happening
When you look around your life
People wilt underneath your sight
Your gaze is like a strange remark
A speeding bullet in my heart
My eyes are closed and scream my name
I'm shaking, don't feel the same
I don't know anything that's happening
That's happening
