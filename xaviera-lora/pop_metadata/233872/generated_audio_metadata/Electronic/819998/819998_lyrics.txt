Fold that track don't hold it back on a backpack from holding up the map
By trip on a taxes grab the atlas
Flat on mattress put them by the patches
Asshole mass revolution of practice using the masses to get a sidekick
What will happen I don't know
Maybe build a massive dome for home
Keep us passive don't watch us grow
We're too busy with Beyonce's videos
What happened to Kim in the gym and her clothes did she swim
Her booty so big it floats
Immigrante no permit in Arizona unless you got a permit to earn it
But after you earn it you better take it for a dance home
Don't let them take it over man go vote
