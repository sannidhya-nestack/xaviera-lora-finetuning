Through your eyes I see the perfect storm
Then I find a wide open door
Please give me some control with the time that I take
As it travels through the wind
There's never any flow of signs coming my way
I just want to believe
I have no destruction
I've been a victim to the passing time
Tell me why the line gets drawn
In my mind
Oh, can you imagine it? Can you see it? Just envision beauty as it seems
When I close my eyes I call for memory
And hope I'm dreaming
Looking out upon the rough and un iving sea
I have found that everything
Can't seem to disappear
To the changing tides
If you let it wash away
You can feel freedom in
All of the hope that you find
I have no destruction
I have been a victim to the passing time
Tell me where the line gets drawn
In my mind
Can you imagine it? Can you see it? Just envision beauty as it seems
Time never stops
Only draw what I want
And wanna be
Each choice to ever show me
I have not destruction
I have been a victim to the passing time
Tell me where the line gets drawn
In my mind
Can you imagine it? Can you see it? Just envision beauty as it seems
