It's just strategies of mind
Growing old is just your time
Shriveled up into your reality
You see bite and we see light
Sometimes sunshine does bite reality
It's just what you make it as we
Snowflakes float gently
Down the rivers of my spine, I'm taking the time
Feeling something rise
Phoenix rises from the ashes, clashes of worlds
Tribal cultures unite
Absurd words, untied minds, battled and fight
We can see humanity and one generation holds light of change
We rearrange the fixed compass in our brain
And we will see the rains fall on the plains of Africa
And we will drive our fucking cars across the centuries
Up and see yourself as a tree
Holding the wind with the leaves that leave you be
Tides of nature's rift are just gifts that we give ourselves
And we are just here now
Perpetually sound
Escapes rise and fall
We wonder where
Tides
Like financial times
And rise tsunamis in minds
Fly
Mountains kiss the sky
And the clouds make the rain
And it washes away the pain
Of everyday living
That's bringing me headaches
And baking my soul
And faking realities
I wanna make whole
See the time that is opening up like butterfly wings
We sing on angels harmonies ring like bells in a church
We see the resurgence of the art resistance
You will find in place your soul's insistence
To express through whatever reality you hold
Sold are the cultures of old in pawn shops across today's bold horizons
Unfolding stories rise as generations stand up, dance on high they understand
That we are just connected to the land, the stars
The people that we are, the souls from a far land
That look nothing that we understand
But they are by understand
