Took my body, you took my soul
You think I'm fragile, but you are wrong
I'm still inside your skin
I know that now, so shake it off
(I want to move forward)
You took my body, you took my soul
You think I'm fragile, but you are wrong
You're so pathetic, you're so afraid
I love to watch you be repaid
You're so pathetic, you're so afraid
I love to watch you be repaid
I will not fall behind (I will not fall behind)
I don't care, I won't be bad (I won't be bad)
I don't care, I won't be bad
Took my body, you took my soul
You think I'm fragile, but you are wrong
But you are wrong
You took my body, you took my soul
You think I'm fragile, but you are wrong
Honesty is not you
You're so pathetic, you're so afraid
I love to watch you be repaid (I should've known)
You're so pathetic, you're so afraid
I love to watch you be repaid
You're so pathetic, you're so afraid
I love to watch you be repaid (these things are mine)
You're so pathetic, you're so afraid
I love to watch you be repaid (yeah)
I'm aware and I'm always ready (yeah)
I'm aware and I'm always ready (say I love you)
(I'm cold, be bad)
(I'm cold, be bad)
(I'm cold, be bad)
(I'm cold, be bad)
(I'm cold, be bad)
