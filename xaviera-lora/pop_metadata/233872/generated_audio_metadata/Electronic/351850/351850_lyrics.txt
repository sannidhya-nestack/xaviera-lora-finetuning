Fear
Don't you see, be the machine
Like a monster, when you bleed
He's in your mind, he's in your eyes
You can't reach him with your guns
Deploy the master, the master weapon
The secret weapon, hit him from sight
It's underground, where you can't see
It is possession inside of me
We feed the machine
We need the machine
Feed the machine
We need the machine
Feed
They want her dead
She's just a show
Her plug
Released from hell
Fight or fight
Only to die
Watch the demons
Try her away
The tape is rolling
Get it all
Seek to destroy
Innocent souls
No one to fight you
Now you've won
You are a god, be your own one
Free, free the machine
Me, me the machine
Free, free the machine
Me, me the machine
(One, two, three, four)
(One, two, three)
Feed, feed the machine
Feed, feed the machine
Feed, feed the machine
Feed, feed the machine
Feed, feed the machine
Feed, feed the machine
Feed, feed the machine
Feed, feed the machine
Feed the machine
