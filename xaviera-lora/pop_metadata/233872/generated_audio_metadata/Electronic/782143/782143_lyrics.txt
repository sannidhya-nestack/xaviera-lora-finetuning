Oh, the cards begin to show, the sun is saying no
But everyone's so delicious, dance, I feel it on your hands
The line says take a chance, maybe I'm just superstitious, superstitious
I like the Gemini'cause they're so schizo
And how the turret's bullets go so deep and slow
So what's your sign, I really can't decide
Virgo, Scorpio, I feel our stars align
Oh, the cards begin to show
The sun is saying no
But everyone's so delicious
And I feel it on your hands
The lines just take a chance
Maybe I'm just superstitious (superstitious)
I loved the girls with the black cat lashes
Looked in the mirror with the broken glasses
So magic 8-ball tell me what's true
Is it real love or are we just cutting us off?
Oh, the cards begin to show
The sun is saying no
But everyone's so delicious
And I feel it on your hands
The line says take a chance
Maybe I'm just superstitious (superstitious)
Don't let your love go by
Before she tells me
Won't let my love go by
I feel it pumping (pumping, pumping, pumping)
Pumping (pumping, pumping, pumping)
Oh, the cards begin to show
The sun is saying no
But everyone's so delicious
And I feel it on your hands
The line says take a chance
Maybe I'm just so
Oh, the cards begin to show
The sun is saying no
But everyone's so delicious
Then, I feel it on your hands
The lines just take a chance
Maybe I'm just superstitious
Superstitious
