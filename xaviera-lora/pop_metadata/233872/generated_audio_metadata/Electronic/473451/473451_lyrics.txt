Out of the sea, out of the lake, out of the mire
Out of the blue
Into the light
Into the blood
Into the light
Into my heart
I see your face
I see your God
I see your light
I see
Out of the sea
Out of the lake
Out of the mire
Out of the river
Into the night, into the blood
Into the night, into my heart
(I'll be) (I'll be)
More, more, more
I'll be home, I'll be
You see my face, you see my height and size
You contemplate
God is in size or shape
Out of the sea
Out of the sea
Out of the night, out of the night, out of the room
Into the light
I see God, I see shame, I see your power
I see light
I see light
Out of the mirror
Into the blue
On a battle of shade and fire
And on a battle of age and life
On a battle of faith and fire
I've had my faith and life
I've had my peace inside
Had my faith and fire
I've had my faith and fire
After much shame and fire
I've had my faith and life
I've had my peace and fire
On a pattern of faith and fire
On a pattern of faith and silence
On a pattern of faith and fire
On a pattern of faith and fire
A pattern of shame and fire
On a pattern of faith and life
On a pattern of faith and fire
