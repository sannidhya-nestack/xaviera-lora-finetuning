Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
Sunlight breaks the dawn
The silence runs and waves again
The words fall down like tears into her heart and her soul and her side
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
Breaking through the dawn
Desperate try to run and stand
Words like one last touch of hope
The soul and his life
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry (don't cry)
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry (don't cry)
