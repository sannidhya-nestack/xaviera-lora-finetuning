So much sadness
Too much poverty
So much sufferance
Too much misery
Silence is the voice of illness
Cry is the voice of pain and sufferance
I would like so much
To change all of this
To establish
Peace and harmony
So I dream
Of beautiful things
Dream in life
Live in dream
So much sadness
Too much poverty
So much sufferance
Too much misery
I would like so much
To change all of this
To establish
Peace and harmony
I can be whatever I want to be
I can't, you can't, we can't be here
