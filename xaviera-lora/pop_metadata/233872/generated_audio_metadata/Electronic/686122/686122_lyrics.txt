We are living on a planet
We are living on a planet
We have to make progress
Bye.
We had to do something about it
We had to do something about it
We are living on a planet
We had to make progress
We are living on a planet with a lot of shame
Hunger and distress we don't know who to blame
But we will do something about it
We will do something about it
We are living on a planet with thousands of food
Obesity and greed so what can you conclude
We had to do something about it
We had to do something about it
We are living on a planet
We have to make progress
Generosity and love is the way again
We have to do something about it
We will do something about it
We have to make progress, again
We have to make progress, again
We have to make progress
We will do something about it
We had to make progress
Generosity and love is the way against
We had to do something about it
We will do something about it
Against
We have to make progress again
We have to make progress again
We have to make progress
