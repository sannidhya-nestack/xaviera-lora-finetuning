Each breath I take is another turn on
An endless round about each hole in my heart
Just streams of love from all I have to give
Each month I shine
Another light goes dark inside me
I'm holding back this brittle night
I'm holding out for the perfect day
I sent my dreams away
To the land they promised me
If I just believed my path to chase
Though I always tried to find it anyways
Each step I'd take
Pursuits turn into painful memories
I'm counting on
The time I've lost
Just take it from that perfect day
I wanna live
I wanna reach that new horizon
I want a new life
But I never seem to find it
I want a new life
I wanna reach that new horizon
I want a new life
So I can get up on my chainsail
Each month that I live, there's new life to give
Each month that goes by, more looking surprises
Each month that I live, there's new life to give
Each month that goes by more than nothing survives
Each month that I live there's a new man to kill
Each month that goes by more than nothing survives
Yeah, I want a new life
I wanna reach that new horizon
I want a new life
But I never seem to find it
I want a new life
I wanna reach that new horizon
I want a new life
So I can give all my dreams to you
