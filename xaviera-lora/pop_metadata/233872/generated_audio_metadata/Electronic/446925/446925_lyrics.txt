What up, what up, what up, what up, what up?
What's up with men who shit the bed and act as if they never said their life was fucked
With alcohol and dribbling with a mind so small
What's up with men who piss their pants and won't admit there's happenstance
What's up with wives that choose to look the other way
And what of our lives in time and place where problems still exist with race
And governments unruled by man but corporate slime out of the scam
The news we hear not news at all but entertainment at the mall
And wars to feed the need for greed and raise the cash for growers blast
What up, what up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Slate it, you faggots, or you won't be dead
Demonize your sign, hypnotize so we won't feel the drag
What up, what up
What's up is how we pawns exist to feed the greedy thorns
These strangling thorns that rule our lives perpetuate the things we hate
It's all about the money tree that fails to assist you and me
But lines the pockets of the rich and makes us all into their bitch
A bunch of wealthy cunts not joining their safari hunts
We can't afford their lavish sweets and are satisfied with puny tweets
We've all been learned into a spell and made our bed inside this hell
Until we wake and take a stand we'll all fall victim to the man
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up (what up, what up, shut up, shut up, shut up)
Swear to your father or you'll be dead (shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up ; shut up, shut up ; shut up ; shut up ; shut up ; shut up ; shut up ; shut up ; shut up ; shut up ; shut up ; shut up ; shut up ; shut up ; shut up ; shut up ; shut up ; shut up ; shut up ; shut up! (Demons should stay hypnotized so we won't feel the dread) (Demons should stay hypnotized so we won't feel the dread)
The time is now, now is the time
We must revolt and claim our rights
For those who snooze will truly lose
The bigger cold is in our
SIGHTS
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up (shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up)
Slay your foes or you'll be dead (you'll be dead, you'll be dead, you'll be dead, you'll be dead, you'll be dead, you'll be dead, you'll be dead, you'll be dead, you'll be dead, you'll be dead)
Demons should stay hypnotized so we won't feel the dread (you'll be dead, you'll be dead)
