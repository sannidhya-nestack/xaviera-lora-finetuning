You come riding these sailors
You come back to find Barcelona's lost
You come by your laser
You come back to find Barcelona's reached
Why? It's because of you from the very first seven nights
I am dead and I am alive and I'm for myself (for myself)
Carried dead and buried dead and I'm for myself
You call my tiredness your path to find my soul
You call back your Isaac
You call him as a final sign of last
Warneighbreds, eclosa, ephala, phyla, cybinoms
Carry on, carry on, the finest I find
Carry on, hurry, play on, the finest I find
Can it happen, how it happened to find us alive?
Can it happen, how it happened to find us alive?
A violent phase
