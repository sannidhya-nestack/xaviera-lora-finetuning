Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh you, oh you, oh you, oh you, oh you
Cornerstone of house
We danced till dawn
Then on and on
Danced in the waves before the sun
We made our place and shared our home
House was our heart
Our cornerstone
We stayed awake and laughed and cried
Danced like silhouettes till daylight died
We made our place and shared our home
House in our heart, our cornerstone
A thousand tears, the rivers cried
Chased the beats until music died
Cornerstone of house
We danced till dawn
Then on and on
Danced in the waves before the sun
We made our place and shared our home
House was our heart
Our cornerstone
We stayed awake and laughed and cried
Danced like silhouettes till daylight died
