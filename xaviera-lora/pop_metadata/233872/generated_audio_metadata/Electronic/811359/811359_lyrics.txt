Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Don't go, don't go, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
I said it way too many times (way too many times)
Stop it (stop it) I said it way too many times (way too many times)
Stop it (stop it) I said it way too many times (way too many times)
Stop it, it's in the way, in the way, in the way, in the way, in the way, in the way, in the way, in the way, in the way, in the way, in the way, in the way
(East wind, east wind, east wind, east wind)
(East wind, east wind, east wind)
(East wind, east wind, east wind)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I used to need your praise
Relied on your surveys
Thought they could validate
But I don't need your critiques
I like my flag real frank
So now I just remind
None of them can define me
And everything is fine
So stop, stop, stop messing with my mind
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Life's in a wheel, in a wheelie (in a wheelie)
Stop it now
Life's in a wheel, in a wheelie (in a wheelie)
Stop it now
Life's in a wheel, in a wheelie
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Stop it (stop it) (stop it) (stop it) (stop it) (stop it) (stop it) (stop it) (stop it) (stop it) (stop it) (stop it) (stop it) (stop it) (stop it) (stop it) (stop it) (stop it) (stop it) (stop it)
