We're neon, light up the sky in cranky colors
We paint the town red, dust to dust
Crank it up, crank it up, much louder
Neon bursts with thought
We're neon, up, up, up, we're on fire
We paint the town red, dust to dust
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Neon bursts with love
Lost in ground and grey zones
Leaves you feeling numb
All you really need, neon love
Time to fight this feeling
To never have enough
All you really need, neon love
Diving deep in colors
Take a leap of faith in love
Show'em what you're made of
Riding through the summer
Raving through the mystical
Diving through your neon love
We're neon, light up the sky in cranky colors
We paint the town red, toast to dawn
Crank it up, crank it up, what's louder?
Neon blue swings low
We're neon, up, up, up, we're on fire
We paint the town red, toast to dawn
Oh oh oh we're on fire
Neon bursts with love
Riding through the red tones
Creeped about to stop
Oh you really need neon love
Don't you wish you were new
If you'd come undone
Oh you really need neon love
Diving deep in colors
Take a leap of faith in love
Show'em what you're made of
Ride into the summer
Brave into the mystical
Dive into your neon light
We're neon
Light up the sky
Crank your colors
We paint the town red
Just to talk
Crank it up
Crank it up
Upside down
Neon blue swift flow
We're neon
Oh, oh, oh, we're on fire
We break the tone from touch to touch
Oh, oh, oh, we're on fire
Neon bursts with sun
Oh, oh, oh, we're on fire
Oh, oh, oh, we're on fire
Neon bursts with sun
