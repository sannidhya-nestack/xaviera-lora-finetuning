And dig a grave and fill it with the bodies
Come on now, baby, do you think you can stop me?
Hey, hey, I'm not okay
Take a bottle down, drain it of its whiskey
Stumble around, I'm feeling sick and I'm tipsy
I can't stand the sound, I'm cursing like a gypsy
Girl you're my favorite now, let me see your hips swing
Dance like you're gonna die, you said I'm just your type of guy
It could've been perfect but we ran out of time
Take the bullet now and load it in the chamber
The sweet loving smell of steel and gunpowder
I tried to save it but it's beyond my power
That sweet scent you wear is now turning sour
Dance like you're gonna die
You said I'm just your type of guy
It could have been perfect, but we ran out of time
Dig a grave and fill it with the bodies
Come on now, baby, do you think you can stop me?
Hey, hey, I'm not okay
Dance like you're gonna die
You said I'm just your type of guy
It could've been perfect
But we ran out of time
But we ran out of time
