Do a line
Inside
Such an, or something more
Waiting to touch the core
Searching for something more
And I'm waiting to touch the core
Something is waiting for me
Somehow I know I got to believe
Got to believe to achieve
We understand we conceive
All the borders of reality
You and I fly when we understand why
Reach on high jump from a plane and kiss the sky
Down here on earth through our life do we birth our dreams
Seven tons of love extreme
Kiss all the past goodbye say your last goodbye
Cause it's time to fly
This ain't the time that Jesus Christ, Vishnu or Krishna
To our own device we roll without the vice
And follow like mice in a cage beyond the rage
In frustration of being human
What do we do then?
The questions on our mind
The quest is on time
The future does shine
The soul feels fine (feels fine, feels fine)
Keep searching for something more
And I'm waiting to touch the core
Something is waiting for me
And somehow I know I got to believe
See believe and achieve make your hearts content deep within the sleeve of your dreams
Touch the core of your soul and just believe
Remember who you are in this world all the battle scars you have scored
While the creative use their minds to create something with the boring get bored
We can fire we can wonder why we're alive walking through this land of dreaming
Here's something screaming in my third eye
To come and raise me on high
Awaken me to fly into destiny's hand
I understand it's awaiting for me to land
Deep in my dreams that become reality
From every thought I believe, concede and see
That shit is so hard, I'm not standing anymore, waiting
Nothing is waiting for me deep inside
Somehow I know I got to try
Super searching to settle the score
Searching deeper for more
Putting foot to floor
Racing through this new reality
Walking with my soul across the waters of time
Begging light to shine to allow me
We see the future paved in gold
On this inner road to freedom
Living dreams we're in'em
Giving love to begin'em
Here we're just believing, believing, living'em
Living, living, living, living, living, living, living, living, living, living, living, living, living, living, living, living, living, living, living, living
Waiting to touch the core
Something is waiting for me
And somehow I know I got to believe
Searching for something more
Waiting to touch the core
Something, a noise waiting for me
Somehow I know I got to believe
Got to believe, got to believe
Call it in, push it out (got to believe, got to believe)
You don't know how to work it out (got to believe, got to believe)
You're open up, closed back down (got to believe, got to believe)
You try a little more
Make your life, call it in, push it out, you don't know how, to work it out
Got to believe, got to believe
