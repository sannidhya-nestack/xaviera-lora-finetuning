I've been thinking about you
For some time now
But you don't notice me
Can you tell me how
How far to heaven
How far to you
Darling, darling, can you tell me what to do?
Have you realized how beautiful you are?
We're dancing slow in front of my car
Faster music comes on
You say I'm dancing like a white boy
Now if you can do any better
Could you show me how?
How far the hell I've been?
How far to you
Darling darling can you
Tell me what to do
How far to heaven
How far to you
Darling darling can you
Tell me what to do
Darling, darling, can you tell me what to do?
How far to heaven, how far to you?
Darling, darling, can you tell me what to do?
