One more night, a solitary, lonesome flight
Drifting in a journey as I am left in pain
Stamped aside
I couldn't stand the fight
When two different worlds collide
It's just so hard
It's just so hard
It's just so hard
It's just so hard
It's just so hard
Can't wait another day
Maybe I can find a way
Harden up a worth of pain
To win you back
I'm living for today
tomorrow's far away
Another love just gone astray
Ooh, it won't be the last
Breaking all the rules again
A game just made for foolish to play
I will try to make you stay
Just one more night
Step aside
I couldn't stand the fight
When two different worlds collide
Oh, it's just so hard
It's just so hard
It's just so hard
It's just so hard
It's just so hard
Can't wait another day
Maybe I could find a way
Harden up the worth of play
Ooh, to win you back
I'm living for today
tomorrow's far away
Another love just gone astray
Ooh, it won't be the last
One more night, a solitary, lonesome flight
Drifting in a journey, these eyes are left in pain
Stepped aside,'cause I couldn't stand the fight
When two different worlds collide, ooh, it's just a sign
It's just so hard
It's just so hard
It's just so hard
It's just so hard
I can't wait another day
Maybe I can find a way
Hard enough but worth the play
Ooh, to win you back
I'm living for today
tomorrow's far away
Another love just gone astray
Ooh, it won't be the last
I'm living for today
tomorrow's far away
Another love just gone astray
Ooh, it won't be the last
One more night, a solitary, lonesome fight
Drifting in a journey, these eyes are left in pain
Stamped outside,'cause I couldn't stand the fight
When two different worlds collide, ooh, it's just so hard
