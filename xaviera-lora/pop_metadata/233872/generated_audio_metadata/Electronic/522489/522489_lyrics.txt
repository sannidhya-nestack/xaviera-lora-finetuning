Tell me what doesn't matter
Where I have been
And tell me what doesn't matter
Where are you going to
Cause I am moving on my way
What's your concern with me?
Tell me why do you worry about me?
I am moving on
I am moving on
I am moving on, I am moving on my way
You used to be the one I knew
But to your surprise I was the one that told you so
I am moving on
I am moving on
I am moving on, I am moving on, I am moving on
I am moving on my way
I'm not moving on
