It began in the Mississippi River, crescent shaped body of marshland curved uniquely along the powerful waters. The river flowed down, around, then upward in a bowl shape, causing a funnel effect for anyone exploring near this part of the Mississippi.
Originally occupied by the Indians
The people who were open to sharing the land
Were manipulated and driven out by the newcomers
The Westerners and the French
In 1718 the French claimed the land
And set forth to shaping a major docking destination
For importing all type of goods including people
Thousands of Africans were the first imports
This cultural mixture gave birth to a new race
New rituals and ultimately a new city

This is the New Orleans atmosphere
This is the money capital (this is the money capital)
This is the money capital (this is the money capital)
This is the money capital (this is the money capital)
This is the motherfuckin' school
This is the motherfuckin' school
This is the Morikami-tsu.
They call it the crescent city due to its below sea level crescent shape
New Orleans is Louisiana's biggest city
One hour away from Baton Rouge, the state's capital
New Orleans is divided into sections known as wards
Many of these wards are represented by a government housing project
Projects in wards is what make up the majority of the inner city living
We see instead of looking
We see instead of looking
This is the Rolling Thunder 2
