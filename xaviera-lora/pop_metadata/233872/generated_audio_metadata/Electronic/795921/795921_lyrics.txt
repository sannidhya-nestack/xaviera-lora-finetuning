I wonder how long until we see each other again
No matter how far baby we've never been just friends
Saturday night comes I will hold you so tight
Loving you is all I need because it feels oh so right
et the other scenes cause I'd rather be with you
A night with just you and me yeah I'd rather be with you
No I don't want nobody else
No I don't need nobody else
et the other scenes cause I'd rather be with you
Oh baby
Oh baby
There's just no one else
That I'd rather spend my time with
Nobody else understands me just quite like you do
Yesterday came and went and it just wasn't enough
Loving you is all I need because you're just so too much
et the other scenes cause I'd rather be with you
A night with just you and me yeah I'd rather be with you
No I don't want nobody else
No I don't need nobody else
et the other scenes
Cause I'd rather be with you
But we can break the flow
And leave it like that if I am by your side now
So let's make it
But nobody's there to play
Tell'em'bout me and I'll tell'em
No, I don't want nobody else
No, I don't need nobody else
I'm down with you
Why did you leave me up and go?
et the other things cause I'd rather be with you
On night with just you and me yeah I'd rather be with you
No I don't want nobody else
No I don't need nobody else
et the other scenes
Cause I'd rather be with you
I said I'd rather
I said I'd rather
I'd rather be with
I'd rather be with you
And no one else
No, I don't need no nobody else
Nobody else
I don't want nobody else
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you, baby
[Outro]
