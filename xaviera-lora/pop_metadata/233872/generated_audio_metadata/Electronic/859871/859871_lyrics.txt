I will rise up now
I will rise up, I will rise up
You've got a way of making me feel small
I won't let your words reach me anymore
Rise up
Rise up
Rise up
Rise up
But I will rise up now
But I will rise up now
Thought you knew all that there was to know
Thought you landed the final blow
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
But I will rise up now
But I will rise up now
Rise up
Rise up
Rise up
Rise up
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna die
Ooh, ooh, okay, rise up
