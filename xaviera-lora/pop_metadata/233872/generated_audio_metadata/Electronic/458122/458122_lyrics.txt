They've been mistaken all the way
It's not about who's right
It's how you both feel at the end of the day
Desperately trying to
Just solve it all in peace
They both fall victim to their emotions
Where he never meant to make herself
At least that's what he said, he never meant to make her sad
At least that's what he said, he never meant to make her sad
At least that's what he said
At least that's what he said
But what's the difference you ask?
Now what's the difference you ask?
But what's the difference you ask?
Now what's the difference you ask?
A breach of trust has opened up
Simply too high to overcome
So backing up is all that's left
It seems
While the feelings fade away
His heart feels kind of numb
And he just hopes that it won't stay
This way
He never meant to make her sad
And it's so sad to watch them go
They could have gone their own way
And it's so sad to watch them go
They could have gone their own way
