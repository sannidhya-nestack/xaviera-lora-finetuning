You made me break, can't you see what you're doing to me
You made me break, can't you see
You made me break, can't you see what you're doing to me
You made me break, can't you see
In it for the unknown, scared of the outcome
I'm just a tool for your entertainment
Never should have gotten so close to the true you
Then I connected for all the wrong reasons
Now here we are in a state of resentment
Just let me go'cause now I am lost
In the fallout
It's come down, down to this
It's come down, down to this
Just let me go'cause now I am lost
You made me break can't you see what you're doing to me
You made me break can't you see
You made me break can't you see what you're doing to me
Just let me go,'cause now I am lost
Just let me go,'cause now I am lost
Just let me go,'cause now I am lost
Just let me go,'cause now I am loss
You made me break, can't you see what you're doing to me?
You made me break, can't you see?
You made me break, can't you see what you're doing to me?
You made me break, can't you see?
