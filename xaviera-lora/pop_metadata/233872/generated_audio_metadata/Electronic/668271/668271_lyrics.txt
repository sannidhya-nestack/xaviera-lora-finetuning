Get up and get up and get up and get up
It's a party over here
Ain't nobody on the wall
We got our hands in the air
Little mama having a ball
Shaking her derriere
Hatin' women like nah
But your boys like yeah
If you get a handful of that right there
Then turn around and let it drop
Do it with no hands
Tongue tied
All I can say is damn
You can tell I'm turned on
By the front of my pants
You out for the night
But I'm down for the weekend
On a quest to find the door
To the party I can creep in
Get it on the floor and have fun
Without thinking
The spot's jail packed
With the visually pleasing
I struck gold
I don't think that I'm gonna get it
I'll be leaving anytime soon
Just been getting used to the people in this monsoon
Plus little mama still dancing on my hardpoon
Got me breaking the sweat leaving this hot room (Let's go)
Yeah, listen (Let's go)
It's a party baby I don't think you ready yet
I see you moving while you rocking that spaghetti dress
I'ma get my chill on in the kill zone
I'ma get someone to feel alone with some heels on
Everybody hit the floor getting sick with it
Yeah she dancing but she wanna show her tits with it
Boy you don't understand but your chick get it
Now hit the floor, pump your fists with it
Make'em all get up and dance, feel the act crazy
And I'll be down here when it stands, we don't act lazy
A couple bottles, couple friends, it's me and my mans
Headbangers ball, baby, just me and my vans
Even the VIP hot, I need a couple fans
Chiefin' like Indians that's sittin' in the native land
Goose on the other side, Bacardi's over here
Tell'em Jay, it's a effin' party over here
Get up, get up, get up
More money, more power, this just how the game goes
Step up in the club, fuck a motherfuckin' bankroll
Love a classic, bro, I'm ready to mango
I'm sippin' remy, she want vodka with the mango
Bang bang, boogie to the up jump, still boogie to the rhythm of the boogie to beat
Y'all listen to me, get up out your seats, start movin' your feet
Y'all came to see Drake's on me, move a little
You ain't gotta feel ashamed, you came to groove a lil'
I refuse to put you in a class with them other broads
You deserve to be with me in the galaxy amongst the other stars
Little sub-size baby, 35 G's'bout to lose my mind
She behind that booty, I swear I ain't lyin'
She fine, she a cutie in the way she grind
Gotta do something to me, Lord
Yeah, listen
