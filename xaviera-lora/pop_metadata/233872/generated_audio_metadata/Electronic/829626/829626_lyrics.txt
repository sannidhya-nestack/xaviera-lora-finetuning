She takes me by the hand
And I don't see her face
Not sure how I got to the beautiful place
Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait
Remember when you felt that first connection
Fair live in your heart and in your soul
In your soul
In your soul
In your soul, no, no, no
In your soul
In your soul
In your soul, no, no, no
