You are a, you are a beautiful disaster
You are a, you are a beautiful disaster
You are a, you are a beautiful disaster
You are a, you are a beautiful disaster
You are a, you are a beautiful disaster
You are a, you are a beautiful disaster
So lift, shake your hips a little louder, come on, come on
Let your hair out, scream and shout, shake it, come on, come on
Big daddy wanna please you
Big daddy wanna see you
Big Daddy wanna take you all over the world
They shake your body squeak and shake that ass on the floor
A winkin' green light spin, ladies, ladies, come on, come on
See you dancin' in the moonlight
I wanna be closer by midnight
Just give me what you gonna, give me, give me, come on, come on
It's your lips, shake your hips a little louder, come on, come on
Let your hair out, scream and shout, shake it, come on, come on
Big daddy wanna please you
Big daddy wanna see you
Big daddy wanna take you all over the world
See you dancing in the moonlight
I wanna be closer by midnight
Just give me what you're gonna give me, give me, come on, come on

You are a, you are a beautiful disaster
You are a, you are a beautiful disaster
You are a, you are a beautiful disaster
You are a, you are a beautiful disaster
