I know for a fact, you don't even know what fuck is!
Fuck off you pricks, you talk dirty, you talk dirty, you talk dirty, you talk dirty, you talk dirty, you talk dirty, you talk dirty, you talk dirty
You talk dirty, you talk dirty
You talk dirty, you talk dirty
Sex sells but who's buying?
Give it up or you're past caring?
What do you think and what are you wearing?
I'd find the whole act, so very tried
Can't get it right, can't even think straight
Can't feel wet, gonna have to wait
When did your fantasy become a reality?
When did your love get past all my hate?
My will to come has come
And I've felt it all along
My will to come has gone and I felt it all along
Sex and sales but who's betraying?
Lie back and think of nothing
Your breath and your stench make me rich
Wanna be your gold, gold, dragon, goldfish
Can't tell the truth until you hold it
I can feel it since I'm so bored with this
What's the aim here? Who's to blame here?
Feel so much for it, I'm losing my wrist
My will to come has come
And I felt it all along
My will to come has come
And I felt it all along
I know you can't be true
I can smell it inside of you
It's all you had to do
But you had to put me through
My will to come has gone (my will to come has gone)
My will to come has gone (my will to come has gone)
My will to come has gone (my will to come has gone)
My will to come has gone (my will to)
And I can smell him inside of you (and I can smell him inside of you)
And I can smell him inside of you (and i can smell)
But when the time has come, I'm not meant to be all alone
But when the time has come, I'm not meant to be all alone
This man of mine, he'll come and he'll set you free
And I'll show myself to you, and I'll explain it to you
Fuck off you freaks
