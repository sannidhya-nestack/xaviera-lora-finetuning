Hot tech low life cyberpunk
Lazy napkin damn we do it our own way
Tech killer neurosyn
Blood rush synthesis
Fire fire light of day
Hackers in the club, come on, put your hands up
If you're looking to fuck, come on, put your hands up
Hackers in the club, put your hands up
If you're looking to fuck, come on, put your hands up
High tech low life
High tech low life
Crash burn override bisexual
You decide dropping bombs like the ANSI
Program purpose looks all worthless
The zero sum of this tie
Hackers in the club, come on put your hands up
If you're looking to fuck, then come on put your hands up
Hackers in the club, man put your hands up
If you're looking to fuck, come on put your hands up
High tech low life
High tech low life
Yeah, hackers in the club, come on, put your hands up
If you're looking to fuck, then put your hands up
High tech low life
High tech low life
Hackers in the club, put your hands up
Looking to fuck, then put your hands up
Tech low life
Tech low life
