Now I'm at the, now I'm at the, now I'm at the beat, now I'm at the beat, now I am at the beat, now I am at the beat
Till the slavery's gone
We'll be united
Till the slavery's gone
We'll be united
The colder and brighter to you
And as it seems I'm fading again
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful, you're so beautiful, you're so beautiful
This moment forever
memories are more than memory
'Cause memories are what I want them to be
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Keep, keep close
And don't make me go
Embrace me to this moment
