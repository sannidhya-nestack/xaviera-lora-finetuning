Every day feels the same
I try to clear my mind but there's your name
My mind is red but my heart is blue
all I ever think about is you
I try to change it every day but my love won't go away
And I try, hold my head up high
I try to change it every day but my love won't go away and I try
Hold my head up high
I put on my clothes, I put on my face and I walk out my door
Trying to smile, trying to pretend that I don't want more
But I do, I really really do
Oh babe, I want you
Baby it's you
I try erase you from my life
But I still cry when I hear Mack the knife
Cause baby that's our song
And it's too easy for you to move it along
I try to change it everyday but my love won't go away
And I try hold my head up high
I try to change it every day but my love won't go away
And I try, hold my head up high
I put on my clothes, I put on my face and I walk out my door
Trying to smile, trying to pretend that I don't want more
But I do, I really really do
Oh babe, I want you
Baby it's you
I try to change it every day but my love won't go away
And I try, hold my head up high
I try to change it every day but my love won't go away
And I try, hold my head up high
I put on my clothes, I put on my face and I walk out my door
Trying to smile, trying to pretend that I don't want more
But I do
I really, really do
Oh babe, I want you
