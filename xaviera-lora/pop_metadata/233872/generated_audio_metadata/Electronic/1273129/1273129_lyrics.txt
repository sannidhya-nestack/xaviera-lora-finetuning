Stroke my hair in the bathroom, hold my hand
On the kitchen floor, smell my perfume
In the hallway, time my lasers
Like you did before
Wherever you want
To show your affection
It's alright
But don't et to
Kiss me on the couch, that would be fantastic
Kiss me on the couch, don't act so cool
If you do it right, I will be ecstatic
Yes or no, I'm a fool to fall for you
Flirt with me on the subway
Touch my arm while we climb the stairs
Serve me coffee in the bedroom
Let us cuddle in a comfy chair
Wherever you move
To show your affection
It's alright
It's alright, kiss me on the couch, that would be fantastic
Kiss me on the couch, don't act so cool
If you don't mind, I would be ecstatic
Yeah, so now I'm a fool, a fool for you (whoa)
Show me love and show me affection
Don't be shy, we have a connection
Show me love, you know the direction, oh, yeah
Kiss me on the couch, that would be fantastic
Kiss me on the couch, don't act so cool
If you do it right, I will be ecstatic
Yes or no, I'm a fool, a fool for you
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
