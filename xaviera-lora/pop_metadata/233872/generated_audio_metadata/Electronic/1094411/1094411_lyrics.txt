Bright lights
Late nights
Half full
Half full
Gold moon
Cups show
Stacks of
Earth
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, yeah, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
Midnight
Red black
Stand up
Smile
Look up
Normalize
Sex on the floor
Green eyes, green eyes, green eyes, green eyes, green eyes
Wishes on the street, wishes on the street
Tilted
Earth gave
Fine lines
And I
Looked tight
We were
Sex gods
Breathe life
What you gonna say?
What you gonna say?
What you gonna say?
