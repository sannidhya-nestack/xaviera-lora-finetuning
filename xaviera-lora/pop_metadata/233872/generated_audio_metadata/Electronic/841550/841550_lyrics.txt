On hold, on hold
Don't wanna live this way
I'd hid myself away
I didn't want to feel this way
You locked my love up tight
And now I'm breaking out tonight
On hold
You put my love on hold
On hold, on hold, I found my lover, cold
You put me in the dark
To keep your hold upon my heart
To take control of my life
My heart I'm taking back tonight
On hold, you put my love on hold
On hold, on hold, I felt my love go cold
Did you think that I would stay?
No one to watch you walk away
Those walls you built to keep me in
I'm breaking through them day by day
On hold, on hold I felt my love grow cold
On hold
