Paint her face with lilacs and reds
Puts on a smile with her lipstick
And she's made of artificial flavor
Polished like a razor blade
Like a razor blade
She's a beauty queen, eighteen works like a machine
A life sized doll with a porcelain face
Behind the mascara she cries
Get me out of this place
Get me out of this place
She takes a breath and says a prayer
And puts on the crown over her perfect hair
And she's the prettiest girl in the nation
Her happiness is validation
Validation
She's a beauty queen
Eighteen marks like a machine
A life size doll with a wholesome face
Behind her mascara she cries
Get me out of this place
Get me out of this place
Pretty girl, lonely girl
Pretty girl, lonely girl
Pretty lonely girl
She's a beauty queen
Eighteen works like a machine
A life sized doll with a wholesome face
Behind the mascara she cries
Get me out of this place
Get me out of this place
Get me out of this place
Get me out of this place
