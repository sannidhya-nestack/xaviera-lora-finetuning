On the way
Autra circumstance
For a dance finale avec moi
Little soldiers, little black, little toy guns
Little feet that can outrun everyone
What destination
Little people, little daughters and sons
Lies beneath your subtlety
Little wars, little prices paid to be won
An impermanent distraction from your sanity
A shifty eye, a curtain drawn, vous doutez de moi
And it feels like you're surrounding me
Feels like you're surrounding me
Feels like you're surrounding me
In a flash in the darkness, time has come
Palm sweat, trigger finger, gotta get one
It echoes with the shape of words
Better look down south
Little soul's lost time, you're a turn attack
Didn't think you were ever gonna come back
You never found a way to come with something real
You hide behind everything you fear
And there's always one more battlefield to find
And there's always one more inside my mind
And there's always one more battlefield to find
And there's always one more inside my mind
Scaredy cat
Why you jumping at the sight of your own shadow?
By the way, flattery is unbecoming
When you're begging me, begging me to stay
And there's always one more battlefield to fight
And there's always one more war inside my mind
And there's always one more battlefield to fight
And there's always one more inside my mind
Always one more little thing around me (It feels like you're surrounding me)
Always one more inside my mind (It feels like you're surrounding)
Purple hearts, red tie, dying yellow stars
Blue ribbon, you could say that you won awards
Like Hollywood, your picture's front page
Get a clap from the minimum wage
Didn't think twice, you didn't even think once
How is this what you think that the people want?
Now we stand with our soul unnerved
Job well done, time well served
