I was king for a day
Now it's all gone away
In the night, in my flight
Oh, it seemed that I dreamed
Flew so high
Hold it tight in my arms
Saw the smiles, saw the charms
With your love, touched my heart
Then it all fell apart
Flew too high
Flew too high
Touch the sky but it didn't come down till the 4th of July, Hutuha
Touch the sky but it didn't come down till the 4th of July, Hutuha
Look too high to survive
In your eyes now I die
What it takes for a break from the knife in my life
Look so high
I'm alone lost in space
With a stone looking face (eyes on the church)
Now I've found someone else to believe and receive
Look too high
Look too high
Touch the sky but it didn't come down till the fourth of July
Look too high
Test the sky but you didn't come down till the 4th of July, 4th of July
You never learn how to make it last, you got your way
Or you were even king before day
Broken down on the boulevard of broken dreams
One day you'll wanna pick it up, jack or move on over
Pick it up, jack or move on over
Look too high
Touched the sky but it didn't come down till the 4th of July, Hutuha!
Test the sky but it didn't come down till the 4th of July, hoo too high (too fast)
Test the sky but it didn't come down till the 4th of July, hoo too high (too fast)
Test the sky but it didn't come down till the 4th of July, hoo too high (too fast)
Test the sky but it didn't come down till the 4th of July, hoo too high (too fast)
Test the sky, right? You didn't come down till the part that you're out of town
