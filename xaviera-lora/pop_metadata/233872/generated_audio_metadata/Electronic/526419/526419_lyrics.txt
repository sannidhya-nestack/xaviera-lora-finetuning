I'm looking at you, you're looking at me
I don't know what to say
When you tell me you wouldn't want it any other way
I just don't understand it
How you can be so blind
Well let me tell you baby here and now
You're no fine
if this is love
I don't want it
If this is love
Let me be
If this is love
I don't need it
It's too darn sad for me
If this is love
Yep, this is love
You never learn the art of filter
My God, the things that you'll say
Are not to my heart
It's just a part of your day
You're so lacking in the social graces
It's as if you were dropped down from the blue
No rules mean nothing
Oh, you're such a strange brew
'Cause if this is love, I don't want it
If this is love, let me be
If this is love, I don't need it
It's too darn sad for me
Now if this is love
I don't want it
If this is love, love it be
If this is love, I don't need it
It's too darn sad for me
If this is love (this ain't love, oh no, no, baby)
If this is love (this ain't love, you know it's true)
This ain't love, oh no, no, baby
I won't be crying over you
I know it's time to figure out why I let you do the things that you do
But until then baby, oh it's goodbye to you
'Cause if this is love (love) I don't want it (I don't want it)
If this is love (if this is love) let me be (let me be)
If this is love (if this is love) I don't need it (I don't need it)
It's too darn sad for me
Now if this is love (if this is love) I don't want it
If this is love, let me be
If this is love, I don't need it
It's too darn sad for me
If this is love, if this is love
This ain't love, oh no, no, baby, I won't be crying over you
Yep, this is love, this ain't love, this ain't love
Oh babe, oh no, no, no, no, no, this ain't love, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
This ain't love, baby, no, no, no
What do you do the things you do?
Oh, this ain't love, oh, no, no, baby
I'm through, I'm through with you, oh
This ain't love, oh, no, no
This ain't love, you know it's true
This ain't love, oh, no, no
I will be right here with you
