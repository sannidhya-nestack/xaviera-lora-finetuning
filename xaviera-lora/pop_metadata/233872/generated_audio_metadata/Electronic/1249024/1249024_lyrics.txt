Deep below this surface
In your gaze I found
Colors mixed like oceans
Silent world, no sound
Liquid dream unfolding
Beneath the waves we dive
Electric pulse igniting
In your depths I feel alive
Dive in your eye
Feel the pressure rise
Lost in your tight
Underwater paradise
Currents pull me closer
Glowing lights reveal
Hidden wreath of secrets
In your heart so real
Dive in your eye
Feel the pressure rise
Lost in your ties
Underwater paradise
Currents pull me closer
Glowing lights reveal
Hidden reef of secrets
And your heart's so real
Tides in your eyes
Feel the pressure rise
Lost in your ties
Underwater, clouded by
The echoes of your heartbeat
In the blue of the air
Dive deeper in your spirit
In this endless kiss
