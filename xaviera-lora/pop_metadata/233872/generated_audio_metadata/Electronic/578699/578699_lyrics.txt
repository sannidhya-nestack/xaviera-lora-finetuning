I've been here before
I've heard your famous last words
Written all over my bones
Afraid to let go
Every goodbye got burned
Made us turn to stone
We used to shine like diamonds forever
But it feels like summer rain has turned to snow
Now it's just you and I screaming'bout whatever
Friendly fire just hurts the most
our blood's all washed together
We surrender to the love we hate (to the love we hate) (yeah)
For better or worse together (for better or worse together) (yeah)
We surrender to the love we hate
It's too little too late
It's you that I chose
I followed my heart
Tried to build us a home
To have not to hold
We caged our little bird
Now it's a monster that's green and grown
Time after time we killed our promises
I can remember when I told you I love you
Walking this line feels like being a hostage
Of the violence that I've swallowed as whole
For better or worse together
For better or worse together
We surrender to the love we have
For better or worse together
For better or worse together
We surrender to the love we hate
It's too little too late
We used to shine like diamonds forever
But it feels some rain has turned to snow
