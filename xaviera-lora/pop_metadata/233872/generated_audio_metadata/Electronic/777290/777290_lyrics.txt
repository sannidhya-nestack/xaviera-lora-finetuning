Music box
Can you imagine my frustration
Constant worry no concentration
This was supposed to be real fun
Feel like I'm lost before I've begun
It comes down to simple mechanics
Don't look for hidden semantics
This music box is more than just
An all collectible collecting dust
I don't wanna hurt night after night
This broken burning hits me up inside
I face my demon every show
Still he never wants to let me go
And the fight I have now wears me down
So lift me out this misery and let me go (go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Music box (music box), music box (music box), music box (music box), music box
Feeling celebrated but undisclosed
Running round in my oblivion like no one knows
Once learned now otten as a new cruel trick
No time to be deviant, I must take care
Of every little part of me that got me here
All the magic left of all these hypocrites
Try to get it through your heads
Try to get it through your heads
Cause I'm wide awake now
I don't wanna hurt night after night
This broken burning hits me up inside
I face my demons every show
Still he never wants to let me go and the fight I have now wears me down
The fight I have now wears me down to hold the attention of distracted crowds
Oh, was I wide awake now?
Oh, was I wide awake now?
The music that I know fills me, the rhythm that I know soothes me
I question every part of me that put me here
Running round in my oblivion, the thought of having to wear a spit down
A time to need to change myself, cause I'm wide awake now
The music that I know fills me, the rhythm that I know soothes me
I question every part of me that put me here
Running'round in my oblivion
The thought of how to rest me down
A time for me to change myself
I'm wide awake now
Oh,'cause I'm wide awake now
Oh
'Cause I'm wild and weak now, I don't want to hurt, I don't want to hurt, I don’t want to hurt, I don’t want to hurt, I don’t want to hurt (I don’t want to hurt, I don♙t want to hurt, I don’'t want to hurt, I don’t want to hurt)
I face my demon and it's all out tonight, but I never want to let it go, I don't want to fight
The fight I have now wears me down
The fight I have now wears me down
To hold the attention of distracted crowds
But I'm wide awake now
'Cause I'm wide awake now
I'm wide awake now
I'm wide awake now
'Cause I'm wide awake now
