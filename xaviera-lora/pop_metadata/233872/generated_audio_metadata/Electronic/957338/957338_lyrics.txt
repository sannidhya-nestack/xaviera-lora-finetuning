Lost and lonely like a stray in the night
Endless solitude I'm waiting
Shadows flicker
Playing with my mind
Wake me, I'm burning inside
We can't resist, we must exist as one
We can't resist, we must exist as one
The love you've taken has shattered all my dreams
Formless conviction I try to hide
You're not the only creature
To walk the earth looking for
Salvation inside
We can't resist
We must exist as one
We can't resist
We must exist as one
We can't resist, we must exist as one
We can't resist, we must exist as one
We can't resist, we must exist as one
We can't resist, we must exist as one
