Desire
Burning from the outside
Burning in my head
This fire
Nothing like the real thing
Don't come around my state
But I'll surrender to it all
Yes, I surrender to it all
Conspired against what he's been dealing
Everything I hate
In spite of the debt that I have given
Your ethics repeat
But I surrender to it all
Yes I surrender to it all
It cannot last
And I ive the past
But I surrender to it all
Yes I surrender to it all
But I surrender to it all
Yes I surrender to it all
