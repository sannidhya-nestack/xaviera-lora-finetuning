The sight of you makes my world go round
I'm never lost but always found
I will always love you
From late at night to the early dawn
The moon is out or even the sun
I will always love you
And if you should ever start to cry
I will be by your side
Cause I will always love you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
When I look into your eyes
I feel it back and it's no surprise
I will always love you
There's so much more that I want to say
But there's nothing that ever conveys
I will always love you
Just to see your smile
Cause I will always love you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I wish this day could last forever
Or if my words could be more clever
I will always love you
There's so much more that I want you to know
But one more thing before you go
I will always love you
Until I see you again
This is the message that I send
Cause I will always love you
Yes I will always love you
