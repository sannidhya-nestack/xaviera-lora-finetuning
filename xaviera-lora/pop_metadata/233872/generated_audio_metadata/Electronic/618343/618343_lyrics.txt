It's been like a freight train
Moving fast with metal locked in place
It's time to jump off
It's time to run
It's time to, it's time to
It's time to, it's time to
Love won't last, you better let it go
Say goodbye to forever and ever and ever and ever
Just let it go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Been running so long not sure where I am
Can't look back, it's here and now
Don't follow my path'cause there's no road back
It's time to, it's time to, it's time to, it' time to, it's time to, it's time to, it's time to
Love, unless you ever let it go
Say goodbye to forever and ever and ever and ever
Just let it go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go
It's time to
It's time to
It's time to
It's time to
It's time to
It's time to
It's time to
Love won't last, you'll never let it go
Say goodbye to forever and ever and ever and ever
Just let it go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go
