The night has come
Darkness is all around
So you better be ready
There's no way you'll be safe and sound
Like a tiger is on the prowl
Like a cobra through the night
She's coming to get ya
Watch out for her deadly bite
She's a love beast, hunting for her prey
You better be ready,'cause she's coming your way
Love beast, one crazy ride
Oh look in her eyes, and you'll see nothing inside
She's a love beast
She's got you now
There's no chance to run away
It is time to learn how close
Pleasure is to pain
She will lure you to her web
Then she'll take you by the heart
And when you think it's over
She will tear your soul apart
She's nothing like you've seen before
Nothing you can do will free you from her claws
She's a love beast, hunting for the prey
You better be ready,'cause she's coming your way
Love beast, one crazy ride
One look in her eyes, and you see nothing inside
Yeah, yeah
She's a love beast
Love beast, she's an animal
Love beast
She's a love beast, hunting for her prey
You better be ready,'cause she's coming your way
Love beast, one crazy ride
One look in her eyes, and you see nothing inside
She's a love beast
