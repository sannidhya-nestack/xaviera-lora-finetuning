Shimmer round, round with the rain fall on me
Down with the snow can never
Come on let the clouds surround me
Make this storm, make this storm clear
For a light through, for a light through
For a light through the light just get up go
Round, round we must go
Pour a light through me, pour a light through me, pour a light through me like a flood of gold (pour a light through me, pour a light through me)
Pour a light through me, pour a light through, pour a light through me like a flood of gold (pour a light through me, pour a light through me, pour a light through me)
Round, round we must go
Or lie through the portion (or lie through)
Or lie through the portion (or lie through)
Or lie through the portion (or lie through)
Make this storm
Run with your rainfall on me
Don't let the snow come down (Don't let the rain fall on me)
Don't let the snow come down (Don't let the snow come down)
This is the world I've come for, I'm grown like a flower (I must go, I must go, I must go)
Pour a lie through me, pour a lie through me, pour a lie through me like a flower
Pour a lie through me, pour a lie through, pour a lie through me like a flower
Don't let the rain fall on me
Don't let the snow come down
Don't let these clouds surround me
Make this storm, make this storm clear now
Surround me
Make this storm, make this storm clear now
Don't look too close around me, break me through
(Round, round, round my skull)
(Lie through me, pour a lie through me, pour a lie through me like a flood)
(Round, round, round my skull)
(Lie through me, pour a lie through me, pour a lie through me like a flood)
(Round, round, round my skull)
Don't make this class around me, make this class around me, make this class around, make this class around me, make this class, make this class around my skull
Round, round, round, round, round, round, round
Shimmer, round, shimmer, shimmer, round, round
Shimmer, round
Down with the rainfall on me
Down with the snow condemned
Come on let these clouds surround me
Make this storm, make this storm clear
Before the light through me
Before the light through me
Before the light through me
Like a shadow floating around
Now we must go
Pour light through me (pour light through me)
Pour light through me (pour light through me, pour light through me)
Make this storm
Don't let the rain fall on me
Don't let the snow come down (don't let the rain fall on me)
Don't let the snow come down (don't let the snow come down)
Make this don't be a lie (Don't let this cast around me) (Don't let this cast around me) (Make this don't be a lie)
Make this don't be a lie (Make this don't be a lie)
Like a flood of blood (Round, round)
Going right through me (Round, round)
Pour it right through me (Round, round)
Pour it right through me (Round, round)
Like a flood of blood (Round, round)
Round my skull
Don't let the rain fall on me
Don't let the snow come down
Don't let these clouds surround me
Make this stone, make this stone clear now
Surround me
Make this stone, make this stone clear now
No one else is closer of me than this one
Light through me, light through me like a storm
Collide through me, fall out through me, fall out through me like a storm
Round, round, round, round, round, round, round
Collide through me, fall out through me, fall out through me like a flood
Three, four
Don't let these clouds surround me (don't let these clouds surround me)
Don't let this snow come down on me (don't let this snow come down on me)
And don't let this cancer around me (and don't let this cancer around me)
Make this storm clear now (make this storm clear now)
My sky
(Groans)
