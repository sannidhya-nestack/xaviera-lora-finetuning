How'bout letting go my heart so it can run free
How'bout letting someone else try to love me
Now I'll stop crying over you and I'll move on too
Just can't stop crying over you and I need to
Can I have my heart
Now that it's time for my life to start
So will you give me
Give me back my heart
So my new life and love can start
How'bout letting go my heart so it can run free
How'bout letting someone else try to love me
Now I'll stop crying over you and I'll move on too
Just can't stop crying over you and I need to
Can I have my heart
Now that you found the new one for you
So will you give me back my heart
So I could find a new love like you
Give me back my heart
It's time for love to start
It's time for love to start
And I need to
So can I have my heart
And I need to
It's time for love to start
Need to, need to
Give me back my heart
How about letting go my heart so it can run free
How about letting someone else try to love me
Now I start crying over you and I'll move on too
