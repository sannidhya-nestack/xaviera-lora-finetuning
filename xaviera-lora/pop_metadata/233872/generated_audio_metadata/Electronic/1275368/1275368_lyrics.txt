In the deep haze of the night I'm softly adrift
Whispers intertwine like shadows that twit
Silken threads of sound weave stories untold
In a city bathed in light where secrets unfold
There's a man in the house, getting around
Oh, getting around
Feel the rhythm, let it flow, guide me through the quiet
Lost in melodies that's you, like velvet, they ignite
Floating on this gentle wave, heaping in this trance
We'll soar across the starry sky in this endless dance
Feel the rhythm, let it flow, guide me through the quiet
Lost in melodies that soothe like velvet babe night
Floating on this gentle wave, keep me in this trance
Run sore across the starry sky, in this endless dance
Feel the rhythm let it flow, guide me through the quiet
Lost in melodies that soothe like velvet babe night
Floating on this gentle wave, keep me in this trance
We'll soar across the starry sky in this endless dance
