I wonder where the snow goes when it dies
And I wonder where I am when I'm alive
Na na na na na na na na
Don't want to feel this no more
Na na na na na na na na na
Don't want to feel this no more
When the lights go out
And I lay my head down
I fall, I fall, I fall
Into the dark on this cold cold night
I see a flash of white from within my mind
And I wonder
Na na na na na na na
Don't want to feel this no more
Don't want to feel this no more (nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
Don't want to feel this no more (nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah)
Don't want to feel this no more (nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah)
Don't want to feel this no more (nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah)
I wonder where the snow goes when it dies
And I wonder where I am when I'm alive
Don't wanna feel this no more
