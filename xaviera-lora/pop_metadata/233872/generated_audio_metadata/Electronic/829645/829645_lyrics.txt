I love it, gotta love it
Oh yeah, I love it
Saturday, oh, Saturday
I'm waiting, I'm hoping that you'll set me free
Can't take the pressure you hold over me
I'm falling, I'm fading, I'm losing my mind
Can't take the pressure and leave you behind
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
I'm dancing, I'm floating, I'm feeling so free
Loving the feeling when love is the key
I'm seeing much clearer how it's got to be
Living my life and living it free
I love it
Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate
I'm feeling much better, so why can't you see?
Living my life, I got to be free
Making a difference and changing the time
Now keep it together, the weekend is mine
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
I love it, I love it, yeah I love it
Oh yeah, I love it
Saturday, oh
Saturday
I'm waiting, I'm hoping that you'll set me free
Can't take the pressure, you hold over me
I'm falling, I'm fading, I'm losing my mind
Can't take the pressure, I leave you behind
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
I'm dancing, I'm floating, I'm feeling so free
Loving the feeling when love is the key
I'm seeing much clearer how it's got to be
Living my life and living it free
I love it
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
