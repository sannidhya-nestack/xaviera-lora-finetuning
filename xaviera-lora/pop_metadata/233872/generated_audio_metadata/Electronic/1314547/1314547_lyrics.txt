I'm ready for it, I'm ready for it
What's that?
What did I dream?
What did I feel?
What did I need?
Mirrors of visions, this night of visions
Mirrors of images, this night of visions
Mirrors of visions, this night of visions
Mirrors of images, this night of visions
Mirrors of visions
This kind of visions, mirages in my dreams
This kind of visions, mirages in my dreams
This kind of visions, mirages in my dreams
This kind of visions, mirages in my dreams
What did I fear?
What did I say?
Mirrors of visions, this light of visions
Mirrors of images, this light of visions
Mirrors of visions, this light of visions
Mirrors of images, this light of visions
Mirrors of visions
This kind of visions
Mirrors of images
This kind of visions
Mirrors of images
This kind of visions
Mirrors of images
This kind of visions
