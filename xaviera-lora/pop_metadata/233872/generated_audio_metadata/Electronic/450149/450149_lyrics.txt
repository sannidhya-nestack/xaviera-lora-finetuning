I'm waking, I'm shaking, I'm violently ill
My world's upside down, please make it hold still
These visions come play with my fears every night
I'm rendered unbalanced, too frightened to fight
I try hard to scream but no sound comes out
My mind feels all twisted, my thoughts filled with doubt
Why can't I move?
Limbs are frozen and still
This dangerous world consumes my free will
(Make me) (Make me) (Make me) (Make me) (Make me) (Make me) (Make me) (Make me) (Make me) (Make me) (Make me) (Make me) (Make me) (Make me) (Make me) (Make me) (Make me) (Make me) (Make me)
(My heart) (My heart) (My heart)
(I hear voices, I hear voices)
Keeps calling again and again (and again and again)
I feel so alone (so much loneliness)
Please make it end
It's haunting my soul
Dismembering my dreams
(To everything)
This nightmare keeps going on (I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't)
Again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
I hear voices, voices in my head, I'm gonna stop it, I'm gonna stop it, I'm gonna stop it, I'm gonna stop it, I'm gonna stop it, I'm gonna stop it, I'll stop it, I'll stop it, I'll stop it, I'll stop it, I'll stop it, I'll stop it, I'll stop it
Why do I remember?
A small child is weeping
All crippled in pain
A small child is weeping
She's burned by a fire
She cannot explain
She's lost precious gifts
There's no love left to see (no love left to see)
As darkness consumes her, I see that it's (as darkness consumes her)
Me (I see that it's me)
I see that it's
It's calling again and again
I feel so alone
Leave me hidden
It's haunting my soul
Dismembering my dreams
This nightmare keeps calling
Again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again
