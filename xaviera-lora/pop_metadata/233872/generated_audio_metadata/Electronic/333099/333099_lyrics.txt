You'd stay and live for a while
Just the two of us, no need to rush
As you walk away, oh won't
You'd stay and live
For a while
Just the two of us
No need to rush
Ma gili te paletu
Ma gili paletu
Ma gili te paletu
Ma gili paletu
Ma gili te paletu
Ma gili paletu
Ma giri pa ra tu
Ma giri pa ra tu
As you walk away
Oh won't you stay
And live for a while
Just the two of us
No need to rush
Keep your love, your love, the love, the love
Keep your love, your love, the love, the love
My dear, you took my soul
Ma gili paletu, ma gili paletu
Ma gili paletu, ma gili paletu
Ma gili paletu, ma gili palettu
Ma gili paletu
Itamadiyono
The more, the more
Keep them in your heart
The more, the more
Walk away
