Words, but why talk?
Your actions have set the pace
Yesterday I survived
Today is another race
Because you're here that's all that counts
I wouldn't die no other way
And if love is your fate
I'll find my own place in this life
I will prepare myself to follow you.
There's a wall between hands
I need you here with me, here with me
There's a wall between hands
I need you here with me, here with me
I can't do this, I can't stand
I need you here with me
Next to me, I can't do this, I can't stand
I need you here with me, I need you next to me
Who was quite dumb
Your actions have set the pace
Yesterday you survived
Today's another race
In your hair that's all that counts
I wouldn't die no other way
And if love is your fate
We'll find our own place
In this life
There's a wall between hands
I need you here with me, here with me
There's a wall between hands
I need you here with me, here with me
I can't do this, I can't stand
I need you here with me
Next to me, I can't do this, I can't stand
I need you here with me, I need you next to me
Es ist alles gesagt
Und deine Taten haben stets das Tempo bestimmt
Ich habe das gestern überlebt, aber heute beginnt ein neues Rennen
Weil du hier bist und das ist alles, was zählt
Ich könnte auf keine andere Art und Weise sterben
Und wenn es die Liebe ist, woran du glaubst
So werden wir unseren Weg finden in diesem Leben
There's a wall between us I need you here with me, next to me
There's a wall between us I need you here with me, next to me
I can't do this, I can't stand
I need you here with me, next to me
I can't do this, I can't stand
I need you here with me, next to me
There's a wall between hands
I need you here with me, next to me
There's a wall between hands
I need you here with me
I can't do this (do this)
