I'm a man who doesn't think about it
I'm a man who doesn't think about it
I'm a man who doesn't think about it
I'm a man who doesn't think about it
I'm not afraid of the world
Liberty and love
Thanks, Louis
For I did disparage their law, religion, and law and marriage
So be my great without the rest
But the greatest for the last
All is dead but one soul
Snap, dee-dah-dah-dah-dah
