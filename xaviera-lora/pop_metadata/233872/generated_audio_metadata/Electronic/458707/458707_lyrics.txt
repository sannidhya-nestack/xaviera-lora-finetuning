Maybe if I wrap myself up tight in this sack can
Snuggle up all warm and soft etting how it's been
And maybe if I focus hard ignoring brutal truth
Let my mind start wandering back to my primal youth
Maybe if I slice these fates so nicely in a row
Hemorrhaging the ghastly pain to strike my bloody foe
Maybe if I jump the shark to exit in the night
Sleeping with the fishes while withholding breath and sight
Perspective is a dangerous thing to live inside the heart
Maybe if I slice these veins
Maybe if I slice these veins
Reflecting mortal fantasies and knowing where to start
Maybe if I slice these veins
Maybe if I slice these veins
Choosing to surrender hope is sometimes best for all
Delivering what cannot cope while rising to the call
Maybe if I slice these fates so nicely in a row
Hemorrhaging the ghastly pain to strike my bloody foe
Maybe if I jump the shark to exit in the night
Sleeping with the fish is what worth holding breath and sight
Not a single promise can restore what is no more
Let us just be honest, sitting here beyond the door
Perception hides its strength when victory has lost its yield
Mother Nature's tempest-twist, the tiniest appeal
Maybe if I slice these veins
Maybe if I slice these veins
Maybe if I slice these veins
Maybe if I slice these veins
Maybe if I slice these veins so nicely in a row
Hammering you with ghastly pain to strike my bloody foe
Maybe if I jump the shark to exit in the night
Sleeping with the fishes while withholding breath and sight
MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
