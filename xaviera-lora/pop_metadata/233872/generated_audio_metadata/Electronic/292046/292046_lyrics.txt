Just me, never letting go
Just me, never letting go
Trust me, never let you go
Trust me, never let you go
Your love is like a miracle
Your love is like a miracle
I cannot wait to see you again
La-da-do-day, ooh yeah
Just me, never let you go
Just me, never let you go
Love is like a miracle
Love is like a miracle
I cannot wait to see you again
La-da-do-day, ooh-wee
Just leave, never let you go, ooh-wee
