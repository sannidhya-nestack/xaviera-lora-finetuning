Look back, front door slams
She's had enough, she said goodbye to every lies
Front door slams
Front door slams
Turn up the bass
Feel no disgrace
Know my place right here
With the beer in my face
Fuck the slams
Fuck the slams
Front door slams
Front door slams
Feel no disgrace
Feel no disgrace
Know my place
Turn up the bass
Do no disgrace
The front door slams
Fuck the slams
