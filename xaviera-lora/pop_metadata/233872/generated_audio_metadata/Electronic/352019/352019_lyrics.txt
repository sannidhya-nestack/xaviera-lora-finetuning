Nothing's cooler than an arrow, yeah
Dead leaves which we can barely sing a song with
We've been talking, we've been gaining weight
We're above 21 grams and less feels
And let's freeze, come on, come on and let's freeze
On a nice break of love
And let's freeze, and let's freeze
Come on, come on and let's freeze
On a nice break of love
Shall we stay at home and look at each other for a century or two
And wait until we're given a rainy time and place and run to make up (run to make up, make up, make up, make up, make, make up, make, make up, make up, make, make, make, make, make, make up, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make We revolve 21 grams in less fields
And let's freeze, come on, come on and let's freeze
On a nice break of love
And let's freeze, and let's freeze
Come on, come on and let's freeze
On a nice break of love
Y déjalo enfriar
Y déjalo enfriar
We're nothing, we're nobody
It's nice to be a ghost
When we're invited to a party
Excuses are so easy
There's no way not to get kisses
The way home is so long
We always get a stay of either
No somos nada, no somos nadie
We're a vote and T1 Crams and Lesbians
And let's freeze
Come on, come on and let's freeze
On an iceberg of love
And let's freeze
And let's freeze, come on, come on and let's freeze
On an iceberg of love
And let's freeze, and let's freeze
Endless peace (Endless peace) Endless peace
