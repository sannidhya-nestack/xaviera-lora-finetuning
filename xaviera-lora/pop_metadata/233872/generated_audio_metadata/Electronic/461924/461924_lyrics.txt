The clock strikes three and I'm still awake
In fact I've been up for four days straight
You're filling my thoughts and fucking my emotions
Should I let you go or should I try to make you mine again
Now the question comes to mind did I have you in the first place
From the first dance to the very last kiss
I'm not gonna try to convince you again
There isn't any more romance but I'm dead since she said
Let's be friends
I don't love you
Let's be friends
What else can we do?
Maybe one day it'll work out
But I'm not gonna wait around
No more
Look me in the eyes, tell me the truth
Would you still say you're back if I told you that I loved you
I guess it's really time that I moved on
But before I do I'll write you one more song
Now the question comes to mind
Did I have you in the first place
From the first dance to the very last kiss
I'm not gonna try to convince you again
There isn't any more romance but I'm dead since she said
Let's be friends
I don't love you
Let's be friends
What else can we do?
Maybe one day it'll work out
But I'm not gonna wait around
No more
Let's be friends, I don't love you
Let's be friends, what else can we do?
Maybe one day it'll work out
But I'm not gonna wait around
Maybe one day it'll work out
But I'm not gonna wait around no more
