(Eee, eee, eee, eee, eee)
(Eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, ooo)
(Eee, eee, eee, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo)
You're cold, but the hands hold me
It's only,'cause you're the only
Your hands, your heart
You call us your people
Be the vision of love
Be the vision of love
Never lonely
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be a virgin, no
Be a virgin, no
Never lonely
Never come to me
You told me that you knew me
And I wish that I were in your heart
