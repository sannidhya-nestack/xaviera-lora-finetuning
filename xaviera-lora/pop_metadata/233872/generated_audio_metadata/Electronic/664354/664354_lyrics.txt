There's so many things that I would like to know
There's so many places I would like to go
There's so many girls that I would love to love
It's always too much but never enough oh oh
There's so many things that I would like to know
There's so many places I would like to go
There's so many girls that I would love to love
I'll meet you in the middle of my dreams, in the middle of the night
Upon my big brass bed, before the candlelight
I'll turn your whispers into screams, but we never ever fight
If you know what I mean
When the morning comes, I'll be waking, I'll be breaking, I'll be down
But don't you worry'bout a thing, girl, I'll come right back around to you
As soon as the sun goes down
There's so many things that I would like to know
There's so many places I would like to go
There's so many girls that I would love to love
It's always too much but never enough oh oh
There's no start, there's no middle and there is no end
It all blends to one, my hallucinatory friend
Don't you know the things I've done just to get back here
Safe and sound with you in my ear
There's so many things that I would like to know
There's so many places I would like to go
There's so many girls that I would love to love
It's always too much but never enough, oh oh
There's so many things that I would like to know
There's so many places I would like to go
