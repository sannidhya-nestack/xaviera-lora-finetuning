In a way, I own, I own my things
How I use you, boss, I own just how I make money
I hear you, I hear you, I hear you, I hear you, I hear you, I hear you
In way
I own, I own my things
Tell my ears to buzz
I own just time with my way
(I'll be your, I'll be your, I'll be your, I'll be your soul)
(I'll be your soul, I'll be your soul, I'll be your soul)
I can't wait, I don't, I don't mind if I'm too fast, I don't just wanna play, I don't
