I want to escape, escape, escape
From the city, city, the city, from the city
I want to escape
Forests, rivers, rivers
Forests
Waterfalls
White blue shores
Horizons
Freedom
Like an endless dream
White blue shores
Rainbow colors
Horizons
I want to escape (I want to escape)
I'm right now (I'm right now)
I'm not alone (I'm not alone)
I can't escape (I can't escape)
I want to escape
I want to escape
