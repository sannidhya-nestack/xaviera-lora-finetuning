Hand on your thigh, fangs to your neck
Fear says you know exactly what's next
Your passion is stroked with loins on fire
As I sink my teeth into you
Orgasm of blood to my rescue
I'm feeding my need
Draining your best
Licking my lips
Undressed
With me at your side
You've lost all free will
Your cells now transform
From my glamoring scale
My toy for the night
New life born of death
Scorch, fire, light
I steal your last breath
As I sink my teeth into asm of life to my rescue
I'm feeding my need, draining your vest
Licking my lips, evil undressed
Priming the tongue
Pulsing the vein
Stealing your life
Lust will drive you insane
As I sink my teeth into you
Orgasm of blood to my rescue
I'm feeding my need
I'm dreaming your best
Licking my lips
Evil undressed
