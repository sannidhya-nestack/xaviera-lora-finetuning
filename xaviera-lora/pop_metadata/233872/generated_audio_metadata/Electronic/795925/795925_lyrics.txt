On our way, we're driving
I'm in the fastest plane
I can't wait to get there
Dealing with you can be such a pain
It's late
Let's not start a fight
I know you're right
You're accusing me of lies
How could I even tell you that
How could I even tell you that
You talk way too much
You talk way too much
How could I even told you that?
How could I even told you that?
You talk way too much
You talk way too much
All you do is complain
About how we never communicate
We're here now
Can we save this for a later date
It's loud but you still try to speak
Into my ear you scream
You're accusing me of lies
How could I even tell you then
How could I even tell you then
You talk way too much
You talk way too much
How could I even call you that
How could I even call you that
You talk way too much
You talk way too much
It's late
Let's not start a fight
I know you're right
You're accusing me of lies
How could I even tell you that?
How could I even tell you that?
You talk way too much
You talk way too much
How could I even call you that?
How could I even call you that?
You talk way too much
You talk way too much
