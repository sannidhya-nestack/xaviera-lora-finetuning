That's why they crown me, me, me, me, me, me
That's why they crown me, me, me, me, me, me
Back out or get blacked out, amnesia
The matador with the force of a cannonball
Listen to me take away your pain like a demoral
And I let the doll from being broke to ball in
Hit the mall with a knot and I spent it all
And now I'm back, better yet to be specific
This time I'm sticking round like a hieroglyphic
And I'm so uplifted
You can catch me in the clouds rapping like birthday presents
I'm so gifted
Never mess with no bogus, my focus shifted
You can't put it back together cause you know I ripped it
Stop staring at the stage there'll be no biting
Better have a freestyle there'll be no writing
Or pulling out a notebook I'll put you in a scrapbook
Filled with all the rap crooks that's a bad look
Going for gold like Palomina
I got wit like Katerina
You're outta here like amnesia
That's why they crown me me me me me me
Back out or get blacked out amnesia
That's why they crown me, me, me, me, me, me
Back out or get blacked out amnesia
Stay in your lane, blow it out the frame
You must be insane, we ain't playing no games
What about that drop, you just wanna go pop
I'm about that life, I ain't pushing no mop
It's about that time and you in the right place
Just say the right words and you will get laced
That's why they crown me, the grand leader
Back out or get blacked out, amnesia
Stay in your lane, blow it out the frame
You must be insane, we ain't playin' no games
What about that drop, you just wanna go pop
I'm about that life, I ain't pushin' no mop
It's about that time and you in the right place
Just say the right words and you will get laced
That's why they crown me, the grand leader
Back out or get blacked out, amnesia
That's why they crown me, me, me, me, me, me, back out or get blacked out amnesia
That's why they crown me, me, me me, me, me, me
That's why they crown me, me, me, me, me, me
Back out or get blacked out
Amnesia or party hard
Ayy they my Mardi Gras
Never needed no protection or a bodyguard
I disregard all rules like an outlaw
Fighting me is unorthodox just like a southpaw
And I doubt y'all follow me throughout at all
Lyrics that are written like scriptures or a novel
Rug the beat unleash the genie in a bottle open sesame
Perfect the impossible rap colossal
Don't believe the hype Andre the giant hype
Roddy call me Roddy Piper with a bagpipe
Why you acting like a dummy it's about to get ugly
You popping like a bubble I just rap like a mummy
I'm way past ugly despicable
When I taste blood I get a grip like a pit bull
Or a Burmese python boa constrictor
It's about to hit the fan cause I'm off the Richter
Stay in your lane, blow it out the frame
You must be insane, we ain't playing no games
What about that drop, you just wanna go pop
I'm about that life, I ain't pushing no mop
It's about that time and you in the right place
Just say the right words and you will get laced
That's why they crown me, the grand leader
Back out or get blacked out, amnesia
Stay in your lane, blow it out
The frame, you must be insane, we ain't playin' no games
What about that drop, you just wanna go pop
I'm about that life, I ain't pushin' no mop
It's about that time and you in the right place
Just say the right words and you will get laced
That's why they crown me, the grand leader
Back out or get blacked out amnesia
