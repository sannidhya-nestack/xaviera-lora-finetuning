You can't fuck with the street,'cause I'm dope on the beat
And every time I'm in the roof, yeah, I'm dropping the heat
We don't give a fuck what you say, what you think
right about now, my dogs, we're on the brink
You can't fuck with the street,'cause i'm dope on the beat
And every time I'm in the roof, yeah I'm dropping the heat
We don't give a fuck what you say, what you think
right about now, my dogs, we're on the brink
right about now, my dogs, we've on the brink
'Cause right about now my thugs we're on the brink
Twisted out, twisted in, let this shit fire up again
Champion flows, mackin' them hoes
Everybody knows that paper stack it grows
Yo, we can never clash but you're really not ready
My paper chase is hard, I'm going in heavy
Twisted out, twisted in, let this shit fire up again
I'm going in heavy
You can't fuck with the street
Cause I'm dope on the beat
And every time I'm in the roof
Yeah I'm dropping the heat
We don't give a fuck what you say what you think
Cause right about now my dogs we're on the brink
You can't fuck with the street
Cause I'm dope on the beat
And every time I'm in the roof
Yeah I'm dropping the heat
We don't give a fuck what you say what you think
Cause right about now my dogs we're on the brink
'Cause right about now my thugs we're on the brink
right about now my thugs we're on the brink
Twisted out, twisted in, let this shitfire begin
Champion flows, macking them hoes
Everybody knows that paper stack it grows
You can't fuck with the street,'cause I'm dope on the beat
And every time I'm in the booth, yeah, I'm dropping the heat
We don't give a fuck what you say, what you think
right about now, my dogs, we're on the brink
You can't fuck with the street,'cause i'm dope on the beat
And every time I'm in the booth, yeah I'm dropping the heat
We don't give a fuck what you say, what you think
right about now, my dogs, we're on the brink
right about now, my dogs, we're on the brink
Cause right about now my dogs we're on the brink
