Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We can walk through this hill garden, living boxes, you and I, no fear
A baby has cried of still my soul
As a love that's buried deep within comes near
We can hear her cries in the nighttime
A mother dove, her old, her children, all that's left
We are ancients, walk through dreams
Living life in modern day extremes
See that man, he is your brother
He's lost in his own humanity
Governments living through people
See people form one big community
Life is like a box of chocolates
Sweet to taste, unwrap the mystery
Feel truth in every word that you speak
It holds together your integrity
We see your lies painted in our eyes from governmental media TV
We see that you are naked, kissed by the sun you run to eternity
Come to me (come to me)
We scream out in the night
We are soldiers on the quest to heal demons with angels by our side
We are the enemy of human
We see all of the children they see straight through our disguise
I can't see you two painted in your crazy eyes
And it won't be long
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-OO-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-OO-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo--oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOO OOOO OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OE
We can't walk through this city, daughter
Living in boxes, you and I don't fit in
Girl, I like the way you look, and I like the way you move
This kind of love is a disease, so lose it, baby, what you gonna do?
We can walk through this here garden
We live in boxes, you and I, no fear
Baby, it's kinda still, my
We can walk through this
We can walk through this here garden
A living box is you and I know we'll feel
A baby's kind of still my soul
I love that
We can hear the cries of the night time mother dove for the children of the dead
We are ancients
Living life in modern day streets (we are angels, we are angels, we are angels, we are angels)
See that man in the mirror
Lost in his own humanity
Governments living through people
See people form one big community
Life is like a box of chocolates
Sweet to taste of random mystery
Feel truth in every word that you speak
It holds together your integrity
We see the lies painted in our eyes from governmental media TV
We see that you are naked, kissed by the sun, you run to eternity
I can see you too, painted in young wood green
The light is gone, I've been living a lie since you left me, I know it's real
My baby is crying, but it still is my soul
That's better than a TV screen, come on, baby
I feel as if I'm lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost
We see your lies painted in our eyes with the comments of the media TV
We see that you are naked, kissed by the sun, you run to return us
Kids, people get sucked into the wrong to turn out
Kissed by the sun and you run to turn it on
You're here being human
Being true to self, no lies
Kissed by the sun and you run
We can't walk through this city all alone
