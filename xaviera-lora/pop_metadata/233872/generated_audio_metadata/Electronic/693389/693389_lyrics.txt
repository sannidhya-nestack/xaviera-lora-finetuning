Watching stars collide
And with you by my side
The galaxies roll by
Watching stars collide
Tonight we're outside
Watching stars collide
And with you by my side
The galaxies roll by
Tonight we're outside
Watching stars collide
And with you by my side
The galaxies roll by
The galaxies roll by
Watching stars collide
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
