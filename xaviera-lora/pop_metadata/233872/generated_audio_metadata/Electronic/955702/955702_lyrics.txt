Too much bread (too much bread, too much bread, too much bread)
Too much dead (too much dead, too much dead, too much dead)
Too much bread (too much bread, too much bread, too much bread)
Wasted (wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted)
Too much bread (too much bread, too much dead, too much dead)
Give it to me slowly, give it to me slowly
Taste it, too much religion
Was not my decision, yeah
Take it from me holy, take it from me boldly
I wasted all of my days
On a pressure point highway, a click from nowhere
Nobody cares for the truth
Hate it, nothing left, too much regret
Give it to me slowly, give it to me slowly
Faded, under the wet
Too much regret, yeah
Take it from me slowly, take it from me wholly
I wasted all my days
On a pressure point highway
Click from nowhere
Nobody cares for the truth
And so I got myself a new pair of shoes
Been walking miles in my favorite blues
I got that homeless feeling as my skin starts peeling
I'm so goddamn scared of you
I'm living life in never never land
I don't wanna be judged but to be judged I can
Took that position on a mission wishing one more day with you
And so I got myself a new pair of shoes
Been walking miles to my favorite blues
I got that homeless feeling as my skin starts peeling
I'm so goddamn scared of you
I'm living life in never never land
I don't wanna be judged but to be judged I can
Took that position on a mission wishing one more day
With you, hated, nothing left
Too much regret, yeah
Give it to me slowly
Give it to me slowly
Fade a little less
Too much regret, yeah
Take it from me slowly, take it from me whole
I wasted all my days
On a pressure point highway, a cliff from nowhere
Nobody cares for the truth
