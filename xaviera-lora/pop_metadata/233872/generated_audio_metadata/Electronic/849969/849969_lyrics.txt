I'll sing you out, play you alive
One more word and you won't survive
And I'm not scared of your stolen power
I see right through you when you're young
I seek, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, whoa, whoa, whoa
What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck?
I see you, I know
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'll see you out, play you a line
One more word and you won't survive
I'll see, I'll see
Well, bye, bye, bye
And I'll see you out, play you a line
I feel the scare of your stolen love
I see the light through your many eyes
I'll see you out, play you a line
One more word and you won't survive
I see, I see
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
And I'll see you out, play you a line
When I'm scared of your stolen love
I see the light through your very eyes
