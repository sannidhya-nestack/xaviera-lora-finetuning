Where you at, what's the plan?
Just trying to see, gonna give you a shout
I heard Dan is throwing a party
No love, won't need to find out
No way to go, nowhere to go
I keep trying to go, trying to flow
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
It's just so sticky in here
Man this is wet
Let's get out of this place
Go somewhere with a little more space
Where you going
What's with all of us
Gotta leave, gotta go
It's all because
Nowhere to go, nowhere to go
I keep trying to go, trying to go
I, I, I, I, I, I, trying to do something
It's just so sticky in here
No way to move, nowhere to go
I keep trying to groove, trying to flow
I, I, I ain't trying to disappear
It's just so sticky in
No way to move, nowhere to go
I keep trying to groove, trying to flow
I, I, I ain't trying to disappear
It's just so sticky and
It's just so sticky and
It's just so sticky and
