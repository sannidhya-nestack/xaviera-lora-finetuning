Every time I see your face
I see my own reflection
Is this love
Or just an obsession
Is this love
Or just an obsession?
Can't take my mind off you
You're the lucky one
Don't leave me all alone
Don't leave me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Is this love?
Or just an obsession?
Can't take my mind off of you
You're the lucky one
Don't leave me all alone
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me
Every time I see your face
I see my own reflection
Is this love
Or just an obsession
Can't take my mind off of you
You're the lucky one
Don't leave me all alone
Don't leave me
