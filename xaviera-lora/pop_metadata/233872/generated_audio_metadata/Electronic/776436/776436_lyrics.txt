Wasted
It's wasted
Wasted
Wasted
It's wasted
I look back
And tear drops from my eyes can't believe
What's left of me today
You're mine
And I was always yours, never knew
That the end will ever come
Play it
Play it
My wizard is late
Late
My wizard is late
Late
My wizard is late
Lays my wasted years (you promised)
And I believe you gave you my all
And you tore me apart
I let go
Just to make you happy
And now you throw everything
Everything, everything I've wait for
Late, late, my wizard is late
Late, my wasted years
Late, late, my wasted years
Late
That is my wasted years
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Late
Late
My wasted years
Late
Late
My wasted years
Late
Lay it, my wasted years
Lay it
Lay it, my wasted years
Lay it
Lay it, my wasted years
Late, my wasted years, late
Late, my wasted years, late
Please, my wasted years
