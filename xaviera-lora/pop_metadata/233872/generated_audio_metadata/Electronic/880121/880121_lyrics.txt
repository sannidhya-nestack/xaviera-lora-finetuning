It's like the words fell out from inside my mouth
It's like we're crumbling down
Can only feel my lips to know somehow
This heartbeat song give me now
It's like the room's spinning round
Sky's on the ground
It's like the walls are sad
Then you come around
Try and pull me out
Turn the volume down
Try and understand
It's like the world's burning down
Can't find myself
It's like this whole thing is mad
Try to understand
Try, understand
To know somehow
Give me now
It's like a rope spinning round
Skies on the ground
It's like the walls are set
Then you come around
Try and pull me out
Turn the volume down
Try and understand
Can only feel my lips to know somehow
This heartbeat song, give me now
It's like the world's burning down
Find myself
It's like this whole thing's flat
Try to understand
Try to understand
Try to understand
