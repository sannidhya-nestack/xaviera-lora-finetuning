Can you imagine my frustration?
Constant worry, no concentration
This was supposed to be real fun
Feel like I'm lost before I've been good
It comes down to simple mechanics
Don't look for hidden semantics
This music box is more than just
I don't collect, I'm all collecting dust
I don't want to hurt night after night
This road converting eats me up inside
I face my demon every show
Still he never wants to let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Feeling myself a rigid but underschooled
Running round in my oblivion like no one knows
Once learned now otten as a new crew trick
The time to believe the end I must take care
Of every little part of me that got me here
All the magic laughs of all these hypocrites
Try to get it through your heads
I'm wide awake now
I don't want to hurt night after night
This broken body gets me up inside
It beats my demon every show
Still he never once let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go
The music that I know, fills me, fills me
The rhythm that I know, moves me, moves me
The lyrics that I know, soothes me, soothes me again
The music that I know, fills me, fills me
The rhythm that I know, moves me, moves me
The lyrics that I know, soothes me, soothes me again
Let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me Go
Let me go, let me go, let mego
