And everything is falling apart between me and you
It's never gonna end
It's never gonna end
We're never gonna get out of the hole we're in
We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing
We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing
We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing
We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing
We're nothing, we're nothing
Would not say, would not say, would not say, would not say
Would not say, would not say, would not say, would not say
Would not say, would not say, would not stay, would not say
Would not say, would not say, would not pay, would not say, would not say
Would not say, would not say, would not ask, would not ask
