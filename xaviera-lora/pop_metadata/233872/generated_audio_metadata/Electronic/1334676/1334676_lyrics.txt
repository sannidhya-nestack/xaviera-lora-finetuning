Don't waste another day
Wonder if we'll ever feel this way again
You and me were meant to be more than friends
More than just the night was lost in Japan
When we were more than friends
I think I'm falling for you
I ain't getting up I think this love is true
No, love isn't perfect but I've fallen for you, fallen for you
I've fallen for you, fallen for you
Home again
You don't ever have to feel alone again
I'll be here for you when your nights get to dark
And the stars start to fall
I can help you fight your demons
I can help you beat them all
I think I'm falling for you
I ain't getting up, I think this love is true
No love isn't perfect but I'm falling for you, falling for you
I'm falling for you, falling for you
