Woke up today feels the same
Heart beats race can't explain
What's love by any name?
Whisper salt under the rain
Breaks my heart heals my pain
What's love by any name?
Love grows love by any name
Still burns hot like flame
Not a game, it's the same
Eyes that shine and call my name
Wraps me up like a chain
What's love by any name?
Love, love, love by any name
Still burns hot like flame
Not a game, it's the same
Eyes that try to call my name
Wraps me up like a chain
What's love by any name?
Love, love, love by any name, name
Still burns hot like flame
Our game is the same
Hands held tight never change
Through the storm through the strain
What's love by any name?
