Something to try, something inside, something to live by
Something to trust, something to say, something to live by
One, two, three and I still see you
One, two, three and I still see you
One, two, three and I still see you
One, two, three and I still see you
This one scene will come with me and this one scene will comfort me
This one scene will come with me and this one scene will comfort me
