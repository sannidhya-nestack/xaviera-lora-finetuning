Will it rain in the middle of my soul?
Will it drench every corner?
Will the layers of dust wash away masks of painted armor?
Will I find a road to walk on?
Will I seek much farther?
Will my strain take on meaning and read like a prayer?
Will I know what song to hum?
Will the drums play together?
Will the tune reach for the stars or be lost in glamour?
जिनबिना वोड़े अले अधिया अगिरुवे
जिनबिना उड़े अले स्कीता आगिरुवे
Will it drain in the middle of my soul? Will it drench every corner?
Will the layers of dust wash away masks of painted armor?
Will I find a road to walk on? Will I seek much farther?
Will my screen take on meaning and read like a prayer?
Will I know what song to hum? Will the drums play together?
Will the tune reach for the stairs or be lost in glamour?
नेने युव मनदल्ली
नेना पिना मने लिए
हनियाजीरुए
नेना पिना
नेना पिना होड़े लिए
Ni na niru e
(Kallu Mollu Kattalu Daari Dooru Doori Ki Savaari)
(Ninna Nanu Pejju Thinamagi Adhira Belakali Nari Vahithaari)
(Kallu Mollu Kattalu Daari Dooru Doori Ki Savaari)
Will the tune reach for the stars or be lost in glamour?
