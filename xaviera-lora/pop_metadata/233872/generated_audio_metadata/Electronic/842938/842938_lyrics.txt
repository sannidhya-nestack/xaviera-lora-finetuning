I missed the chance to take pleasure in you
You sincerely committed your whole heart to me
While I am too busy to deem you
Despite my blunt face, you love me
I am too busy with a fancy life
Do not believe in the adventure of love
For me to complete you is your main desire
I want to be that big player
I was upsetting you
I was trapped not to cherish you
I wasn't loving you back
I was trapped not to feel you
I was trapped in the night for not believing love
I was trapped in the night for not adoring you
I am too eyeless to see you at the right time
I am too heartless not to give you my heart
Trapped in the night, I couldn't see the light
I do not feel the influence of love
Passion may change my whole existence
It might set me free, free from these dark thoughts
I realized my blunder at the wrong time
Love can save me from the trap (save me)
I was upset in you
I was trapped not to cherish you
I wasn't loving you back
I was trapped not to feel you
I was trapped in the night
For not believing love
I was trapped in the night
For not adoring you
Trapped in the night
Lifeless for breaking your heart
Trapped in the night
I miss my chance to cherish you
To be trapped in the night, to be trapped in the night
Deprived of the romance
To be trapped in the night, to be trapped in the night
I'd never take the chance to make you happy
I was upsetting you
I was trapped not to cherish you
I wasn't loving you back
I was trapped not to feel you
I was trapped in the night for not believing love
I was trapped in the night for not adoring you
