Because I lived in the world
Australia
Where the dreams unfurl
Take me to an island
Far away from the city grind (Take me away)
See me on a white beach
Far away from the life I lead
Give me time to chill'em
And a year to pass my time
I'll see you at the sunset
In the dreamtime, enjoy the ride
My island, home to the land of the dreamtime
Understand that we gotta let the dreams unfurl in the red sand
Desert clay, one culture, everyone one way
Use the day and fly away
Generations of nations rise together under one sun survive
To your sun sets appear too small
All the way to the biggest island in the world
Make the call and you'll have it, have it all, yeah
Pushin' me, keep pushin' me, you're pushin' me
All the way to the biggest island in the world
Keep pushin' me, you're pushin' me, keep pushin' me
Land of dreams where the dreams unfurl
Take me to an island
Far away from the city grime
My island home
Enjoy the ride
My island home, my island home
My island home, my island home
My island home, my island home
My island home, my island home
