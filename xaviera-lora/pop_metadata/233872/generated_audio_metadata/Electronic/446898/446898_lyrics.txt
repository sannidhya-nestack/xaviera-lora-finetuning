It'll be fine! It will be fine! It'll be fine! It'll Be Fine! It'll Be Fine! It'll Be Fine!! It Will Be Fine!! It Will Be Fine!! I wake up
I wake up and then I can't sleep anymore
And the voices, they're in my ears, they're in my brain, they're in my ears, they're in my brain
I'm waking, I'm shaking, I'm violently ill
My world's upside down, please make it hold still
These visions come play with my fears every night
I'm rendered unbalanced, too frightened to fight
I try hard to scream, but no sound comes out
My mind feels all twisted, my thoughts filled with doubt
Why can't I move? Limbs are frozen and still
This dangerous world consumes my free will
I don't stop, I don't stop, I don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don' stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop.
(My dream) (My dream)
(I hear voices, I hear voices)
Keeps calling again and again (again and again)
I feel so alone (so much loneliness)
Please make it end
It's haunting my soul
Dismembering my dreams
(Take it in)
This nightmare keeps going on
Again and again and again and again
Again and again and again and again
Again and again and again and again
Again and again and again and again
I try to et, but I can't seem to help it
You're poison, poison, poison
Why do I rely on them?
A small child is weeping, all crippled in pain
A small child is weeping, she's burned by a fire
She cannot explain, she's burned by a fire she cannot explain
She's lost precious gifts
No love left to see (no love left to see)
As darkness consumes her, I see that it's (as darkness consumes her)
I see that it's me, I see that it's
It keeps calling again and again
I feel so alone
Please make it end
It's haunting my soul
Dismembering my dreams
This nightmare keeps calling and I
Again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again
