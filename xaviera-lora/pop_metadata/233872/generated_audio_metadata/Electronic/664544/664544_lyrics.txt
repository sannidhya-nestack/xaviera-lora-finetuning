Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
And I'm taking over everything you've ever done
You told me once or twice but I can't remember which one
Your shades are leather
You look pretty together for a girl with a tummy in her cheek
God only knows my shoe size and I
And I'll cry under these blue skies
God only knows my shoe size and I
And I'll cry under these blue skies
God only knows my shoe size and I
And I'll cry under these blue skies
God only knows my shoe size and I
And I'll cry under these blue skies
And all he knows is my shoes size and I'm (mm mm mm mm)
(mm mm mm mm)
(mm mm mm mm)
(mm mm mm mm)
God only knows my shoe size ain't nothin'
And I'm cryin' in these blue skies
God only knows my shoe size ain't nothin'
And I'm cryin' in these blue skies
