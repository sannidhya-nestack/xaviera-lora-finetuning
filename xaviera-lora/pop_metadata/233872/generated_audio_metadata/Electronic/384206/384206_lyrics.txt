You wait for me
In slavery
The rescue from the past
Will come by my request
Eternity
Is here for me and for those memories
You will see
Summer in the world
Doesn't matter what you say
After crying time
You will never feel the pain again
Sometimes when I feel alone
I'm standing on the ground
You wait for me in slavery
The rescue from the past will come by my request
I pray for you in my darkest mind
Release is coming with pain
Hunting her
Summer in the world
Doesn't matter what you say
After crying time
You will never feel the pain again
Sometimes when I feel alone
I'm standing on the ground
Summer in the world
Doesn't matter what you say
After crying time
You will never feel the pain again
Sometimes when I feel alone
I'm standing on the clouds
