Reaching out to new directions, whoa
Trying hard to find my way
In my mind there's a memory
You and me some other day
From this world I want to hide you
Take you where the morning shines
You will find the warmness in my arms
If you just let me take you away
You should know that you are welcome
Stay as long as you want to stay
I know that you came too late into my life
But for you it's worth the wait
From this world I want to hide you
Take you where the morning shines
You will find the one that's in my arms
If you just let me take you away
I'll take you away, yeah
I'll take you away
I'll take you away, yeah
I'll take you away
From this world I want to hide you
Take you where the morning shines
You will find the warmness in my arms
If you just let me take you away
Take you away
I'll take you away, yeah
I'll take you away
I'll take you away, yeah
I'll take you away
(Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it)
