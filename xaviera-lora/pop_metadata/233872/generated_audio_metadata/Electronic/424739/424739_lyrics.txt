This is where we started and this is where I want to go
Please don't feel down hearted, just let your feelings show
You can't run away, you can't meet somebody new
Just let me say all I want right now is you
Just let me know
Tell me how you feel
What I'd like to know
How to set you free
This is where we started
This is where we started and this is where I want to go
Please don't feel damn heartache, just let your feelings show
You can't run away, you can't meet somebody new
Just let me say, all I want right now is you
This is where we started and this is where I want to go
Please don't feel down hearted, just let your feelings show
This is where we started
This is where we started
This is where I want to go
Please don't feel downhearted
Just let your feelings show
This is where we started
And this is where I want to go
Please don't feel damn hearted
Just let your feelings show
This is where we started and this is where I want to go
Please don't feel damn heartache, just let your feelings show
