We, we live eternities to find
The peace that we've been looking for
Unity for the rest of time in our lives
We'll walk a thousand suns
Leaving our footprints in the sand
Follow the crystal seas
On our journey to paradise
You take me to paradise
Paradise
Take me to paradise, paradise
Take me, take me
Breathe, breathe all your air into my lungs
I've never felt this kind of rush
We're like a comet in the sky, we burn
We'll walk a thousand suns
Leaving our footprints in the sand
Follow the crystal seas
On our journey to paradise
You take me to paradise
Take me to paradise, paradise
Take me to paradise, paradise
You take me to paradise, paradise
Take me to paradise, paradise
The waves would crash, the sun would burn
As we sail off to paradise
And we will find our way
Take me in
