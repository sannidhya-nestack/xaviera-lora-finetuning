I keep the candle for the nights when the lights go out
I watch the sun depart and leave the sky to darkness
Beneath the windows are the faces with our features
And in the mirror shadows draw you closer
As the candle goes out
They give you nothing but the street lights and the rain I am dissolving
I am dissolving as the quiet silently waits
See them smile when the street lights in the rain
I am dissolving
I am dissolving as the quiet silently waits
See them smile
Hiding in the dark, they're waiting for us to fall
And in the midst of the shadows, don't look for the sun
But the streetlights and the rain I am dissolving
I am dissolving
As the quiet silently waits
See them smile
When the street lights in the rain
I am dissolving
I am dissolving
As the quiet silently waits
See them smile
Under street lights, in the rain
Under street lights, in the rain
Under street lights in the rain I am dissolving
I am dissolving
As the quiet silence me awakes
See them smile
Under street lights in the rain I am dissolving
I am dissolving
As the quiet silently waits
See them smile
Under streetlights, yellow rain
Under streetlights, yellow rain
Under streetlights, yellow rain
It's all a thing of the moment
I have to give all of it
If only that's true, I would still be here
Oh
