I can feel you watching, every move I'm dropping
Why don't you come over say hi
Promise that I won't bite, know you see what you like
Come and show me what you're about
Everybody's moving, so why are you waiting?
Don't you wanna feel me tonight?
Time to make your move boy, before the party's over
You got my full attention now
You're my fate, Allah Jackson
You got me for life
Oh, I just can't stop
