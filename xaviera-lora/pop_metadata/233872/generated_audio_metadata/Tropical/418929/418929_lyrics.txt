I like the solitude
You call it loneliness
Hide the world inside
People don't know where I am
In this old intersection
Living on the other side
You question all my sanity
I think it's fine
When our doors are open
I see the people outside
The fear strikes in inside me
Don't know what to do but cry
So I close the door again
The fear in my heart decides
All I think is sound
What is all I hide?
Ooh
Waking on all of the days, waking on all of the nights
Sleeping over full beds and settled over dreams
Bleeding from all of my hearts
Bleeding from all of my vice
Somewhere is all of the night
You could be out
So I drink into the silence
So I drink into the solitude
And I can't afford the violence
And I can't afford it anymore
I have seen you okay
You will see around the distance
There've been a fool in lies
All I can do is cry
All alone
All I can do, all I can do, that's what I do
Love and suffer for love to suffer
All I can do is cry, ooh, that's all I can do, that's all I can do
All I can, all I can, all I can do is fly
(All I can do is love, all I can do is love)
All I can, all I can, all I can, all I can
All I can, all I can do is cry
All I can, all I can do is cry
