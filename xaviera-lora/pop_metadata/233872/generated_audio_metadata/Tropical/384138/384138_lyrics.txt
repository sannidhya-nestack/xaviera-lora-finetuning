Oh my God.
Sitting in class, face is like glass, and I know I'm an ass when he calls me to answer
I stumble around, mumbling words, only buzzing like birds, and I can't understand her
I'm wondering if girls are thinking about me, imagining worlds where clothes are not on me
The teacher demands I talk about history, but my time is stuck in the swirls of your mystery
So no, I don't know the answer
And no, I have no retention
I can't pay attention in the spring
When the girls are out on the green
And the summer dresses cover my head when I try to think
Give me a smile, give me a wink
Hormones on fire and I'm on the brink
The windows ajar and she's down below
I gaze from afar knowing she'll never know though
I'm wishing that she was returning my stare
Winking and wording and wanting me there
Head in my lap and she plays with my hair
Never a thought of domestic affairs
And no, I don't know the answer
And no, I have no retention
I can't pay attention in the spring
When the girls are out on the green
And the summer dresses cover my head when I try to think
When I, when I try to think, when I, when I try to think
I think of the sun, I think of tan bodies, I think of bare legs
I think of your eyes, I think of your toes, I think of the freckles dotting your nose
I think about lips never chapped, maps of your hips and picnics and blankets and grapes
I think about touch, I think about talk, I think about sex and nothing much
Besides, I think I'm shallow and thin, endorphins are sweet but I'm giving in
So, fail me my good man, I'm feeling young
Fail me, my good man
Fail me
I wrote that?
Yup
It's like Shakespeare
Should we do another chorus?
So no, I have no retention
And no, I have no retention
I can't pay attention in the spring
When the girls are out on the green
And the summer dresses cover my head when I try to think
I don't know, I have no
I mean no, I don't know the
I mean no
