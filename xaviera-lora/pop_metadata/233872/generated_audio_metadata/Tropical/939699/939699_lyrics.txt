You asked me out and I said no
You asked again now away we go
And I'm so glad it's working out so far
Yeah here we are
Holding hands and talking daydreams
My heart beats faster whatever that means
Sometimes we'll get lost going with the flow
But I know
We're gonna get it right, we're gonna get it wrong
Making it up as we go
What a sweet surprise as we stumble along
Falling in love with just making it up as we go
Sometimes we fight, most times we don't
And the kissin' is nice when the nights get cold
We don't know what we don't know about us
But we like it
We're gonna get it right, we're gonna get it wrong
Makin' it up as we go
What a sweet surprise as we stumble along
Fallin' in love, we're just makin' it up as we go
There's no map to follow
Don't know where we'll be tomorrow
But you know that's okay, yeah
We'll just wander our own way
we're gonna get it right
We're gonna get it wrong
Making it up as we go
What a sweet surprise as we stumble along
Falling in love, yeah, we're making it up
We're gonna get it right
We're gonna get it wrong
Making it up as we go
What a sweet surprise as we stumble along
Falling in love with
Just making it up as we go
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Here we go here we go here we go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Making it up as we go
