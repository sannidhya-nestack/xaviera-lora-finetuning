(Fuego, amor) (You feel it, papi) (Es una noche no hay control)
Esta noche no hay control
Gold dust on my skin
Layers burning slow
Dancing in the moonlight
Corazón let go
Y se me olvida
Whispered words to my ears
I'm lost in the rhythm, can't disappear (can't disappear)
Yeah, rum on my lips, fire in my veins
We spin like the waves, no need for names
The night's alive, me on my place
Oh baby, you drive me insane, midnight kiss
When fancy, rhythm got me crazy
You and me in a place like this
Can't resist, lost in love in the caribbean mist
Midnight kiss, baila corazon
I'm the spanish stars to the break of dawn
You and me, no promises
Only hit, only blessings
Yeah, señorita with the gold chain swing
Body tall out don't need no ring
From Havana to Madrid we bring that flame
No rules tonight we don't play no game
No game, don't play no game
Hey chica, ven para acá
Move that body, ole mama
Sunrise hits but we still won't stop
Fire in your eyes I'm about to drop
La noche me corta
Tu sombra en mi piel, I don't know your name, but I feel your soul
La noche, mi corazón
Midnight kiss, mueve mueve así, rhythm got me crazy
You and me in a place like this, can't resist
Lost in love in the Caribbean mist
Midnight kiss, baila corazón (woo)
Under Spanish stars'til the break of dawn (woo)
You and me, no promises, only, only bliss
(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a) (I'm a, I'm a, I-I-I-I-I-I-I)
