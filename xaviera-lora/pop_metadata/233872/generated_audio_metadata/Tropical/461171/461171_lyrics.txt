Down in Tampa, baby, sun it shines all day
Burning clear and bright like a hot spotlight
On this tiny girl who gives her hips a twirl
Swearing easily, defying gravity
Ooh-la-hoo
Moving to an inner beat, yeah
Hula hoop
Twisting up and down the street, yeah
Hula hoop
She never seems to let them drop
Hula hoop
Hula hoop girl
Hula hoop girl
Oh yeah
Hula hoop girl
Doo-da-hoo, girl
She was born to shake it, grab a hoop and takes it
All along the shore, everyone wants more
It's a magic show, swinging high and low
Oh those hips can't spin, she moves them out and in it
Hula hoop
Moving to and in her beat, yeah
Hula hoop
Twisting up and down the street, yeah
Hula hoop
She never seems to let them drop
Hula hoop
Hula hoop girl
Hula hoop girl
Hula hoop girl
Who are who, yeah?
Boobs attract this girl
They orbit'round the world
Oh, there's no disguisin'
Why she's mesmerizin'
She's just exercisin'
We're just fantasizin'
Where'd she learn to do it?
How'd she learn to groove it?
Groove it, groove it
Movin' to and in a beat (Hula hoop)
Twistin' up and down the street (Hula hoop)
She never seems to let them drop (Hula hoop)
Hula hoop girl
Hula hoop girl
Hula hoop girl
Hula hoop girl
She's a hula hoop girl
Defying gravity yeah
Twisting whirling down the street yeah
She never seems to let me drop it
