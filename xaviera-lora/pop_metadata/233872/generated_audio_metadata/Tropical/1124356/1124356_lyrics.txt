Lord have mercy now, yeah
When the light you're needing
Feels so far away
And all that you believe in
Disappears in phase now
When it's time to lean in
You can't be afraid
hope is on its way, yeah
hope is on its way
You gotta pray for the positive, yeah
Give what you gotta give, yeah
Live how you wanna live, yeah
And always be an optimist, yeah
Lose negativity
Be the best that you can be
Bring the change that we all need
Pass the message and play at the scene
You gotta pray, pray
Pray, pray for the power of the higher power
High up in the sky
Sending out a signal
Helpin' us to fly (to fly)
You can tap the power
You just got to try
Just try and you can fly
You gotta pray for the positive
Give what you gotta give
Live how you wanna live
And always be an optimist
Lose negativity
Be the best that you can be (you can be now)
Bring the change that we all need (yeah)
Pass the message and plant the seed
You got to pray, pray
Pray, pray for the positive
Everything that we ever need
Waiting in the clouds for you and me
Everything that we ever need
Waiting in the clouds for you and me
You gotta pray for the positive
Give all you gotta give (Lord have mercy)
Live how you wanna live (how you wanna)
And always be an optimist
Lose negativity
Be the best that you can be (you can be now)
Bring the change that we all need (eh)
Pass the message and play at the scene
You gotta pray, pray
Pray, pray for the positive (yeah, yeah)
Pray (you gotta pray now)
Pray, pray for the positive (eh)
