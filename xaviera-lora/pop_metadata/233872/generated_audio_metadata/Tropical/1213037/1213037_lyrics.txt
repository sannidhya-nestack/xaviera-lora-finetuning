I know a little cafe bar
A little walk, it's not too far
We can spend the afternoon
Talking sweet things, me and you
And if you want to stay all day
There's many games that we can play
Love is easy after noon
Talking sweet things, me and you
I know a little cafe bar
A little walk, it's not too far
We can spend the afternoon
Talking sweet things, me and you
And if you want to stay all day
There's many games that we can play
Love is easy afternoon
Talking sweet things, me and you
