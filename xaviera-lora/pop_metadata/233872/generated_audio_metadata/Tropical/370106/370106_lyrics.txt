I believe there's something special
People making gold from metal
Mountains made from grains of sand
Waters flowing from dry land
Bringing eyesight to the blind
Turning water into wine
Drawing blood from a stone
Feeling love whenever you're alone
That's the kind of change you bring
You make the dumb man wanna sing
I done wrong and paid the price
Walked through hell to paradise
You make an old man born again
My life blood and my oxygen
Nothing else that it could be
Can't you see your love is alchemy
Oh what a change
This man is not the same
Oh what a shame
You're the fuel for this burning flame after me
Yeah yeah
That's the kind of change you bring
You make a dumb man wanna sing
After no one paid the price
Walked through hell to paradise
You make an old man born again
My life, blood and my oxygen
There's nothing else it could be
Can't you see your love is out to leave
Oh what a change
This man, this man is not the same
Oh, what a change
You're the fuel for this burning flame after me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
After me
Your love, your love, your love
