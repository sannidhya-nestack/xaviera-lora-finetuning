People say I'm crazy, that I've lost my mind
I could argue with them, but it's a waste of time
I may not own a nice car, who wants to pay for gas
They're in too big a hurry, to see the world they've passed
I let go all my worries
I lay back and unwind
I let the world drift by me
It's just a state of mind
Lazing on the shoreline
Sand between my toes
The waves are trickling through them
As they come and go
With a cold drink beating
And music in my ears
Just concentrate on breathing
Enjoy the time I'm here
I let go of all my worries
I lay back and unwind
Let the world drift by me
It's just a state of mind
I've been known to drift out
Every now and then
Check back in a while
To see just where I've been
Floating in the ocean
Laying on the sand
Taking life real easy
When and where I can
Oh, I let go all my worries
I lay back and unwind
Let the world drift by me
It's just a state of mind
I let go all my worries
I lay back and unwind
Let the world drift by me
It's just a state of mind
State of mind
Hey hey
