Usually I'm the kind who knows just what to do
I've been around a little and I've learned a thing or two
But when you are near me my palms begin to sweat
And I stammer like a fellow whose mouth and mind just met
I know I am such a fool
I'm acting like a child who's never been in school
ive my clumsy touch
But I never met a woman who I thought I loved this much
Don't act surprised if I stumble when you're around
I should put on the makeup'cause I've been a hopeless clown
My tongue gets dry and my words all scatter and flee
It's a wonder that you managed to take me seriously
I know I am such a fool
I'm acting like a child who's never been in school
ive my clumsy touch
But I never met a woman who I thought I loved this much
I know I am such a fool
I'm acting like a child who's never been in school
ive my clumsy touch
But I never met a woman who I thought I loved this much
Give me a chance to rewind to when we met
I wasn't quite prepared for the way you stole my breath
Every now and then I might seem a little dazed
But when you are beside me I have to say that I'm amazed
I know I am such a fool
I'm acting like a child who's never been in school
ive my clumsy touch
But I never met a woman who I thought I loved this much
I know I am such a fool
I'm acting like a child who's never been in school
ive my clumsy touch
But I never met a woman who I thought I'd love this much
No, I never met a woman that I thought I'd love this much
No, I never met a woman that I thought I'd love this much
