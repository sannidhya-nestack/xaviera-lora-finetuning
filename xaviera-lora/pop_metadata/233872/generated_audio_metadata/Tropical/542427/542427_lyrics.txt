There's a frozen margarita in the corner of the bar
And another señorita and an old Spanish guitar
And the lure of Acapulco has faded long ago
And I'm drinking with the locals'cause I've got nowhere to go
There's a girl in Amarillo
Who I can't get off my mind
And when I lay upon my pillow
There are answers I can't find
Well, I thought a little venture
Might help to ease the pain
But my off-the-cuff adventure
Has proved itself mundane
Yeah, the sun and moon and Mexico are only in the way
Of a craving that I can't let go
How I need you here today
And I thought of late siesta
My hair may close my eyes
To the desperate way I've missed you
But a soul may crystallize
There are Spanish words around me
There is laughter and there's cheer
And the memories surround me
And take me far away from here
Yes, it seems my little haven
Has only been another hell
And it's really not worth saving
Yeah, I guess it's just as well
'Cause the sun and moon and Mexico are all in the way
Of a craving that I can't let go
How I need you here today
And I thought of late siesta
That helped me close my eyes
To the dire way I've missed you
But it's only crystallized
La la la la la la Mexico
La, la, la, la, la, la, Mexico
And I thought a late siesta might have me close my eyes
To the desperate way I've missed you
But it's only crystallized
La la la, la la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la
