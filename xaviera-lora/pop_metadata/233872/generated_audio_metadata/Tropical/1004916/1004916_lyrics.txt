Pretty girl from the Piazza
Won't you come and dance with me?
We'll spend the night romancing
Won't you please come home with me?
In the morning you'll be wondering
Just how I stole your heart
Pretty girl from the Piazza
I loved you from the start
Pretty girl from the Piazza
Oh what are we gonna do
Pretty girl from the Piazza
One night I just want to do
Pretty girl from the Piazza
Oh I want to marry you
Let's go tell your mama
Just what are we going to do
What a night of sweet romancing, how it felt so right
Now if I could just remember her name
I got a problem, oh what a problem, don't know what to do
What if someone asks me her name?
Pretty girl from the Piazza
I don't mean to complain
Though we spent the night romancing
Why can't I remember your name?
Pretty girl from the Piazza
I loved you from the start
Oh pretty girl from the Piazza
I wish I knew your name
