We've been looking at the weather
Eyes searching every sky
We should spend more time together
Please don't take us by surprise
One summer rain, don't let it fall
One summer rain, don't let it fall
The glass and the grain
It couldn't be much better
But don't wake me up if I fall asleep in the sand
The breeze is lighter than the air
Like a dress before your eyes
The trees are writing you a letter
To find
And drifting on the tide
Want some more rain, I'll let it fall
Want some more rain, I'll let it fall
The glass and the grid
It couldn't feel much better
But don't wake me up if I fall asleep in the sand
And what it would mean to be there
Dancing in light together
You know it would be complete in the real life
Ain't nothing to pay to be there
nothing can last forever
No, don't you judge a field of black and white
Don't you black and white
We've been looking at the weather
Eyes searching every sky
We should spend more time together
Please don't take us by surprise
Warm summer rain, I'll let it fall
Warm summer rain, don't let it fall
The glass and the grain, they couldn't hit much better
But don't wake me up if I fall asleep in the sand
But don't wake me up if I fall asleep in the sand
Don't wake me up if I fall asleep
