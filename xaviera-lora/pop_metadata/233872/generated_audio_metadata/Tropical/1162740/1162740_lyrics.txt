Eastern Bay
Sun getting hotter on our way
Boat in the water shade our eyes
Watch as the seal goes floating by
Easy to feel those
Warm summer days out on the bay
Hoping they stay this way forever
Empty the mind, see what you find
Taking the kind, warmth of the weather
Oh, glide on the water
Oh, wind on the water
Oh, move on the water
Oh, waves on the water
Everybody wants a warm, bright sun and day
Everybody wants a chance to get
Everybody needs a place to fill their soul
Everybody has a thing that makes them whole
Sink in the water
Float in the water
Swim in the water
Trip in the water
Fish in the water
Crab in the water
Bird in the water
Seal in the water
Sail in the water
Board in the water
Dive in the water
Snorkel in the water
Worm in the water
Clam in the water
Mussel in the water
Lobster in the water
Oh, glide on the water
Oh, wind on the water
Oh, move on the water
Oh, waves on the water
Everybody loves the warm bright sun and day
Everybody wants a chance to get away
Everybody needs a place to fill their soul
Everybody has a thing that makes them whole
