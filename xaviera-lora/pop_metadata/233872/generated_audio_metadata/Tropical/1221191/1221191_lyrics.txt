I'm leaving New Orleans, I'm going away
I'm leaving New Orleans, I'm leaving today
I'm leaving New Orleans, I'm going away
I still love New Orleans, I know I can't stay
We all love a party (party)
And we've got the best
Got the Mardi Gras (Mardi Gras)
Got the jazz fest
We've got special music
Good food and great friends
But I can't get nothing done
the party never ends
I'm leaving New Orleans, I'm going away
I'm leaving New Orleans, I'm leaving today
I'm leaving New Orleans, I'm going away
I still love New Orleans, I know I can't stay
I'm leaving New Orleans
I'm going away
I'm leaving New Orleans
I'm leaving today
I'm leaving New Orleans
I'm going away
I still love New Orleans
I know I can't stay
I'm leaving New Orleans, I'm going away
I'm leaving New Orleans, I'm leaving today
I'm leaving New Orleans, I'm going away
I still love New Orleans, I know I can stay
I'm leaving New Orleans
I'm going away
I'm leaving New Orleans
I'm leaving today
I'm leaving New Orleans
I'm going away
I still love New Orleans
I know I can't stay
We're leaving New Orleans
We're leaving New Orleans
We're leaving New Orleans
We're leaving New Orleans today
