Let's go now, oh yeah
Downhill is over, the fun has just begun
Join in the bondush and party in the sun
Horiatric colors, costumes everywhere
People are dancing with feathers in their hair
Oh, welcome to you one and all
Oh, it's time for carnival
Oh, it's easy to become enthralled
Oh, with the carnival
Marching through the streets so unappropriate
People walking by dressed in masquerades
Painted faces wearing trap dress
Joining the party, be the world's guest
The floats and the pageants are beautiful to see
The sombre dancers are moving gracefully
Caught in the rhythm your feet begin to move
Why try to fight it? Surrender to the groove
Oh, welcome to you one and all
Oh, it's time for carnival
Ooh, it's easy to become enthralled
Ooh, with the carnival, yeah!
Marching through the streets, a wonderful parade
People walking by, dressed in masquerades
Painted faces, wearing tribal dress
Join in the party, be their welcome guest
Vendors are pushing their carts along the street
There's children and old folks swaying to the beat
It's a tradition, one that enchants
Don't try to fight it, come and join the dance
Oh, welcome to you one and all
Oh, it's time for carnival
Oh, it's easy to become enthralled
Oh, with the carnival
Oh, welcome to you one and all
Oh, it's time for carnival
Oh, it's easy to become enthralled
Oh, with the carnival
