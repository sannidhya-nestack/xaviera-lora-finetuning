With the cool breeze off of the bay
And as the night eases out of the day
We're riding down the coast of L .A. with nowhere to go
From the speakers throbbing with sound
We got our own audio playground
And the DJ's spinning his spell on the beach radio
Come on, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Turn up your radio
Baby, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Come on, tune in the show
Playing songs that we wanna hear
Setting just the right atmosphere
With the wind blowing through our hair
We haven't a care
Molly's trying to set us free
And we're jamming along to this plea
Crank it up as high as you can
And let it play here
Come on oh oh oh oh oh oh
Turn up your radio
Baby oh oh oh oh oh oh
Come on tune in the show
Walk by the shoreline
Sit back and recline
Watching the sun slowly fall
The music is drifting
Your spirits are lifting
We're hearing the radio's call
It's a soundtrack to our life
An escape from worries and strife
In a world of peace and joy
Where we want to go
From the speakers driving the sound
We got our own audio playground
And the DJ's spinning a spell
On the beach radio
Come on, whoa
Whoa, turn up your radio
Baby, whoa, whoa, come on tune in the show
Come on, whoa, whoa, turn up your radio
Baby, whoa, whoa, come on tune in the show
Yeah, it's radio
