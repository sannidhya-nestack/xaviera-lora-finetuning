Making love in the afternoon
It's like a flower that's in full bloom
You're so fine, you're the sunshine of my life
Take advantage of the sunny sky
I seek release in your green eyes
You're so fine, you're the sunshine of my life
Ooh, it's the way you look at me
Mm, it's the way you feel to me
Mm, it's the touch and the scent of your skin
That's the way it's always been
I've lived the sunshine life
Ever since I've known you
I've lived the sunshine life
Ever since I've known you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
A simple life is what I seek
A lazy day to bring relief
You're so fine, you're the sunshine of my life
Other friends may come and go
There's no one who will ever know
What our love is like
You're the sunshine of my life
Ooh, it's the way you look at me
Mm, it's the way you feel to me
Mm, it's the touch and the scent of your skin
That's the way it's always been
I've lived a sunshine life
Ever since I've known you
I've lived the sunshine life
Ever since I've known you
I've lived the sunshine life
Ever since I've known you
I've lived the sunshine life
Ever since I've known you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
The sunshine light
The sunshine light
The sunshine light, ooh
The sunshine life
The sunshine life
The sunshine life
