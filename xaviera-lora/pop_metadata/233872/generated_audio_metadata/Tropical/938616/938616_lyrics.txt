On the dance floor, yeah they call me trap lord
Roll up in the back door
On the dance floor, yeah they call me trap Lord
Roll up in the back door, you know that man a star
Riding through the night
Hoping for some rain drops on this empty sky
All I really see is you
All I really see is you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
On the dance floor, yeah they call me trap lord
Roll up in the back door, yeah yeah
On the dance floor, yeah they call me trap lord
Roll up in the back door, you know that man a star
Riding through the night, riding through the night
Hoping for some rain drops on this empty sky
All I really see is you
All I really see is you
