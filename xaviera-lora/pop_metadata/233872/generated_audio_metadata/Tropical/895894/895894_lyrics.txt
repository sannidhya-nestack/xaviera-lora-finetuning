Insane thoughts fly from your lips
Like chickenpox they spread the itch
Now I got what you got and it ain't what I want
Some days I'm not strong enough
To fight off all your monkey stuff
And it may sound outrageous
But crazy's contagious
Now you feel better, I feel worse
My good mood now needs a nurse
I got chills and fever, and I don't want either
You suck me in like a vacuum
And I just wanna flee the room
you're dangerous
And crazy is contagious
Yeah, crazy is contagious
I've tried to stay calm and collected
I've tried to breathe ten times but I'm infected
I'm a carrier on the run
And I've totally come undone
Crazy, crazy, crazy is contagious
Crazy, crazy, crazy is contagious
Crazy, crazy, yeah yeah yeah
I left your house but I ain't free
road rage took over me
I lost my cool now I feel like a fool
I'm carrying around your disease
The F word flies with such great ease
Now I lost my patience (I lost my patience)
Crazy's contagious (crazy) yeah
Crazy's contagious (crazy, crazy)
Yeah, crazies, contagious
I'm going crazy
