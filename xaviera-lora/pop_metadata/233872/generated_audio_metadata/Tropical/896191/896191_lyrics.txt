Well, I've seen that you were gone
et about it
Man, there's something you've got wrong
et about it
Many can't seem to get back on
et about it
Why is something you want so wrong
You et about it
She rolls the sun never gonna be around again
Before you know it you'll be falling all around
So et about it
My passing leaves are getting me wrong
et about it
For another say you will come
et about it
Fools and thieves try to take a piece of you
So you would et about it
The poor and the fallen say you know where, man
et about it
You're falling fine
Nothing you can do will rewind the tape
The sun will shine lovely and warm
So et about it
et about it
et about it
et about it
et about it
