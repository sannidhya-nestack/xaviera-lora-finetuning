Merengue, merengue, be with me tonight
Merengue, merengue, the music is bright
Merengue, merengue, it's never too fast
Merengue, merengue, now let's make it last
Yes, it's hot music so right from the start
Corazon, corazon, it captures your heart
Your feet move, your hips sway, your thoughts left unsaid
Cabeza, cabeza, it gets in your head
Merengue, merengue, come stay in my arms
Merengue, merengue, I'll bring out your charms
Merengue, merengue, we'll go to the heights
Merengue, merengue, in darkness and light
Yes it's hype music
Corazon corazon
Your feet move your hips sway
Cabeza cabeza
