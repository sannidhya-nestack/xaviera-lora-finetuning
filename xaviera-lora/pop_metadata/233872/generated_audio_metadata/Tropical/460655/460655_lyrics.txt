So let's go to Mexico
Far away from the ice and snow
Let's go to Mexico
Feel the sand seep through our toes
Diggin' out of this winter storm
I want to flee to a place that's warm
Feel the hot sun on my face
I'd be in a state of grace
With a margarita in my hand
Had nothing to do with nothin' planned
No job to make me feel depressed
Away from the daily stress
So let's go to Mexico
Far away from the ice and snow
Let's go to Mexico
Feel the sand seep through our toes
Let's go to Mexico
Where the weather's hot
And the cold drinks, whoa-oh-oh
Let's go to Mexico
Take me where the warm winds blow
Maybe I'll just enjoy the view
Or take a dip in the ocean blue
Adventure awaits
It's beckoning me
To see us there beneath palm trees
The boats are drifting slowly by
Silhouetted on a darkening sky
It's a postcard that I'm living in
It's hard to hold back my grin
So let's go to Mexico
Far away from the ice and snow
Let's go to Mexico
Feel the sand seep through our toes
Let's go to Mexico
Where the weather's hot
And the cold drinks flow
Let's go to Mexico
Take me where the warm winds blow
We ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, we ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, we ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, we ooh
So let's go to Mexico
Far away from the ice and snow
Let's go to Mexico
Feel the sand seep through our toes
Let's go to Mexico
Where the weather's hot and the cold drinks flow
Let's go to Mexico
Take me where the warm winds blow
That's where I'd like to go
Down to Mexico
