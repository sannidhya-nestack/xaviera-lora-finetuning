I need to go limbo, limbo
I need to go limbo, limbo
I need to go limbo, limbo, limbo tonight
Juanita she works all day
So at night she has time to play
She jumps into her beat up car
Then she heads to the local bar
She's so ready she's in the mood
Feels the music she's in the groove
Watch her troubles all slip away
It's time to move it's time to sway
Juanita go limbo, limbo
Juanita go limbo, limbo
Juanita go limbo, limbo
Limbo tonight
Why need a girl limbo, limbo
Why need a girl limbo, limbo
Why need a girl limbo, limbo
Limbo tonight
To the floor she shows some haste
Stretch her body and bends her waist
Gets in line and starts to shake
She gives the boys a huge heartache
With her body their eyes go wide
Just how long can she keep a stride
Oh that girl she gets so low
She's so spry when she's in the flow
Why need a girl limbo, limbo?
Why need a girl limbo, limbo?
Why need a girl limbo, limbo?
Limbo tonight
I need to go limbo, limbo
I need to go limbo, limbo
I need to go limbo, limbo, limbo tonight
The stick goes high, the stick goes low
Where it moves, Juanita goes
Jive right into the beat
She fills the room up with the heat
Take a rest then another go
Just how long, man, you never know
Buckle up for a bumpy trip
Here she comes for another dip
Juanita go limbo, limbo
Juanita go limbo, limbo
Juanita go limbo, limbo
Limbo tonight
I need to go limbo, limbo
I need to go limbo, limbo
I need to go limbo, limbo
Like limbo tonight
I need to go limbo, limbo
I need to go limbo, limbo
I need to go limbo, limbo, limbo tonight
I need to go limbo, limbo
I need to go limbo, limbo
I need to go limbo, limbo, limbo tonight
I need to go limbo, limbo
I need to go limbo, limbo
I need to go limbo, limbo, limbo tonight
I need to go limbo, limbo
I need to go limbo, limbo
I need to go limbo, limbo, limbo tonight
