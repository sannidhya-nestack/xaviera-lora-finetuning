Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on baby
Come on baby
You give me sungles
Come on baby, come on baby, come on
I need your love
You give me fire, you give me love
You give me fire, sometimes I need it more
You give me fire, you give me light
You give me fire, power, sometimes I need it more
You give me fire, you give me love
You give me fire, sometimes I need it more
Baby
You know I live for you my love
You know I stay the same
You know I live for you my love
That's the only way to pay the bills
You know I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
It's put away the pain
It's put away the pain
You give me fire, you give me power, you give me life
Things I never knew before, things I never knew before
Color
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Never knew before
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
You give me fire, you give me light
You give me power, since I never knew before
You give me fire, you give me light
You give me power, since I never knew before
You know I live for you my love
You know I stay the same
You know I live for you my love
That's put away the pain
You know I live for you my love
That's put away the pain
Let's put away the weight of life
