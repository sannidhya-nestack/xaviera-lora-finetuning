I wanna be out by the ocean and watch my favorite things go by
Watching palomino waves crash against the windswept summer sky
I want my inside voices quiet, the ones that rub me the wrong
I wanna be out by the ocean and this time I wanna stay
I've been working so damn long and now I'm of the mind to stop
Seems half my life has passed before me
While I was working, working oh so hard
But all that working pays is money
And money ain't the thing that stays
With you always in your heart like the windswept sky in the Palomino waves
I wanna feel the southwest wind as it blows upon my face
Feel that salty mist remind me there's no better time or place
I am dreaming of the ocean on the happiest of days
I am running up the surf, searching for some palomino waves
Now I'm riding them like horses, their response is more than quick
I am surfing them on bareback
Now I will not miss a trick
I must have been some kind of otter
In some other kind of life
I must have been a grey seal flying through the water late at night
The beauty is inside the notion that I'm riding deep and rough
It's like riding on the wind
Pushing tons of other stuff
May the strongest times be with you
And may they move in your direction
May your ride be ever sweeter and may it meet you with perfection
May you dream in of the ocean on the sweetest waves you can
May you ride and ride and ride
Then turn around and ride again
