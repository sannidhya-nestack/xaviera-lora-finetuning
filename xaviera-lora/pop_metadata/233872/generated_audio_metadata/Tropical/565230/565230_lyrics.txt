I, oh, I wanna love you more
A man looks to his woman
Says I don't know what you see in me
You make me feel this way
Many years go by, we live, we laugh, we cry
She said, from the start you stole my heart and I
Oh, I wanna love you more and more
And don't you know I
Oh, I wanna love you more and more
Friends in a car, one says he's going far
To make a better way
The other he exclaimed
I wish I felt the same
No matter where you go
I want you to know that I, oh, I
Wanna love you more and more
And don't you know I, oh I
Wanna love you more and more and more
And don't you know
Out there on the streets
Strangers we will meet
We all have different views to show
But if we join our heads and hands
To make our master plan
We see the colors make a beautiful rainbow
Oh yeah, oh wow
Oh yeah, oh wow
What in the world have we come to
Whom this life should we run to
We all know the answer
Where's this gift of iving
Look at the life that we're living
I want you to know that I
Oh I
Wanna love you more and more
And don't you know I, oh I
Wanna love you more and more and more and more
Though we come from different sides, living different lives
Ooh, that's okay
It's still the same old sun who shines on everyone
Every day, yeah
Oh, I wanna love you more and more
And don't you know I, oh I
Wanna love you more and more and more
And don't you know I, I, I, I, I, yeah I
Wanna love you more and more
And don't you know, I, oh, I, wanna love you more
And more, and more, and don't you know, I, oh, I
I wanna love you more and more and more (I wanna love you more)
Ooh, oh, oh, yeah (I, oh, I)
I wanna love you more and more and more (I wanna love you more)
And don't you know, I, oh, I
I wanna love you more and more (I wanna love you more and more, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah)
I wanna love you more and more and more (I wanna love you more and more, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna love you more and more
