Come and see how fine life can be
Living our life in highlands
A magical place full of history
A nautical town of fishermen and sea
A mystical retreat come journey and explore
The gateway to the Jersey Shore
Mount Mitchell overlook
Across the bridge to Santee Hook
C Street ferry from M .I .C.
It's a short cruise way
Battery Lewis and Veterans Park
The water which comes out after dark
The twilight shines so bright
Let the lighthouse guide your way
Leave your worries behind
All the peace you'll find
High on life in highlands
Everything's alright down the shore
Come and see how fine life can be
To deny our life in islands
Relax, do what you want
A boat full of green is fine, restaurants
Out of your kayak, it's so much fun
Or just bask in the sun
Fishing off a boat, get drinking beer
Neighbours always gather here
Watching the sunset fade away, a romantic getaway
Grab your guitar and join a band
Music playing all across the land
So much to see, so much to do
Spend the time in islands with you
Leave it all behind
For the love you'll find
High on life in highlands
Everything's alright down the shore
Come and see how fire lights can be
Living out our life in highlands
High on life in highlands
Everything's alright down the shore
Come and see how fine life can be
Living out our life in highlands
Say hi, hi, hi, hi, highlands
Say hi, hi, hi, hi, highlands
Come and see how fine life can be
Living out our life in islands
Living out our life in islands
High on life in highlands
Living high on life, ooh, in highlands
High on life, in highlands
Living high on life, in highlands
High on life so high, living high on life
Living high on life, in highlands
Highlands
