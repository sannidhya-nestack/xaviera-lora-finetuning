America, America
I hold you dear in my heart
Hello America, how are you today?
I've been thinking about you, though I'm far away
And when I'm lonely my thoughts of you are true
I love you
Lots of crazy people in the shadows everywhere
You, you've got your problems but they'll be repaired
Heaven holds a place for you I'm really sure
Land of hope you'll endure
America, America, America, America, America, America
I hold you dear in my heart
Romantic heroes of my childhood in my mind
Helps to pass the time away
Helps to make life rhyme
You're just a smile away
You're with me all the time
Forever in my mind
Looking through the pages of a glossy magazine
You're part of history, you're always to be seen
More than a legend or a time swept movie queen
I love you
America, America
America, America
America, America
I hold you dear in my heart
America, America
America, America
America, America
I hold you dear in my heart
Trapped in a drowning world there's heartache everywhere
Sometimes you feel real pain and wonder if it's fair
Your dreams are wonderful especially when they're shared
With you I'm never scared
America, America
America, America
America, America
I hold you dear in my heart
America, America
America, America
America, America
I hold you dear in my heart
America, America
America, America
America, America
I hold you dear in my heart
