Two little frogs on a lily pad
Tryin' to make you feel like home
He says, "Baby, we got it made"
She says, "Oh, come on and leave me alone"
We ain't got no flies to eat
How will we ever survive?
He says baby we got what we need
You know love will keep us alive
We got simple needs
Dee dee dee dee dee dee
We got simple needs
All simple needs my way
What are you talking about?
You see the hawk up in the sky
Now how will we ever protect ourselves?
He's watching us with hungry eyes
Ooh, he says don't overcomplicate it
you know without ease
It ain't no film, no our life's sweet green
Just hide with me beneath the greens
We got simple means
Dee dee dee dee dee dee
We got simple means
We could be happy if we jump into the void
Let's take a chance and dance upon our little asteroids
Now two lovers on a summer night
Staring at the great big sky
A shooting star takes their breath away
It kinda makes me wonder why
Ooh, life gets so complicated
Well, it's hard to get from A to B
In the techno forest you've got to look real hard to see
We got simple means
Dee dee dee dee dee dee
We got symphony
Yeah, huh, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
We got simple needs
