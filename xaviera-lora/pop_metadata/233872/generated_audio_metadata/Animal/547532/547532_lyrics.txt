I was at Katie's house playing ball in the backyard
And Katie threw the ball really hard in the bushes
And I ran to get it
And there was a baby bumblebee sitting on a leaf
It must have lost its mommy
I watched for a few minutes to see if its mommy was coming back
And she didn't
So I thought it would be neat to take it home to my mommy
That way she could take care of the baby bumblebee
My mommy would be so proud of me
I bring it home, baby, bumblebee
Won't my mommy be so proud of me
I bring it home, baby, bumblebee
Ouch! He stinged me
I thought we would have fun
I thought he liked my house
I liked him
Katie and I tried to find something to put him in, so I could take him home, but we didn't want him to be scared, so I just held him in my hands. It's all really fuzzy. So I walked home to my house and tried to open the door, but it was hard because I had the baby bumblebee in my hand.
I guess I squeezed him too hard, and he got really mad
And he stinged my hand, it hurt really bad
I dropped him on the ground and ran into my house crying
It hurt so bad
I had to find mommy she'd know what to do
Mommy heard me came to see what was wrong
I told her what happened
And she put some medicine on it and made it feel all better
She told me that you can't pick up bees'cause they have stiggers
Even the babies, when they get scared they sting you
I'll never pick up another baby bumblebee again
I bring it home my baby bumblebee
Won't my mommy be so proud of me
I bring it home my baby bumblebee
Ouch he stings me
Bye baby bumblebee
