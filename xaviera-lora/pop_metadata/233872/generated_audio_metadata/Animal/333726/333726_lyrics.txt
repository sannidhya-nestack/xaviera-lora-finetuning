If you're a dog, life is rough, rough, rough
But a kennel and a bone is enough, enough, enough
But a dog with gift of speech has some dreams that he might reach
And I'll tell you all about it off the cuff, cuff, cuff
A dog is somewhat humble, not inclined to rant and ramble
But perhaps that's'cause he hasn't got the gab
A dog that's got some lingo, that wants to go to bingo
Can step outside and hail himself a cab (taxi)
He can parley with the driver, and tip him with a fiver
After talking about the weather and what may be
A dog with an opinion, ruler of his own dominion
Could elucidate the world from A to Z
I could bone up on history to comprehend the mystery
Of pyramids and science and of law
I could be a politician to exercise my vision
To show them all just what a dog is for
But enough of this lecture, it's simply my conjecture
Of what a dog with speech could ever be
'Cause not to be a bragger, I'm better off a wagger
A dog's life is completely tax free
