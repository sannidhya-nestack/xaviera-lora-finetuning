Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't define you
I can't define you
I can't define you
You got my heart beating fast
Oh, can you make this feel last
Every little thing, every little thing you see
Every little part, every little part of me you can have
Every little piece, every little piece you find
Every little spark, every little spark you light up
It lights
You're my hero tonight, tonight
You're my guiding light, my light
Oh well, oh well, oh well
