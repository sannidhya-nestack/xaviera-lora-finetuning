You can have it all
You can have it all
Should I buy you?
Make you feel like I'm accepted
Touch my being
Make me know that I don't et
With your love, with your soul, with your everything
With your love, with your soul, with your everything
Kiss the lips now
Make me come alive, you can have it all
Push me to the floor
Make me scream for more, you can have it all
Let me in
Let me know that I'm infected
With your love
With your soul
With your everything
With your love, with your soul, with your everything
It's a love song, make me come alive, it can't end it all
