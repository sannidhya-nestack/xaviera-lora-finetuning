I gotta know if you're still really mine
I gotta know if you're just passing time
Baby lately you seem far away
Falling further from me everyday
Tell me what's going down
I can't stand it when you're so shoved down
Honey are we only marking time
Time is the one thing we never replace
And you know I'm not wasting mine
I gotta know if you're still really mine
I gotta know if you're still really mine
I gotta know if you're just passing time
Baby lately you seem far away
Falling further from me everyday
Tell me what's going down
I can't stand it when you're so shut down
Honey are we only marking time
Time is the one thing we never replace
And you know I'm not wasting mine
I gotta know if you're still really mine
If you're out of love
If you're out of love
If you're out of love
'Cause I need a lover, not a pretender playing with my heart
