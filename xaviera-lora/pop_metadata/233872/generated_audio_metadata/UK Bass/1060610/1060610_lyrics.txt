Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I need the light shined on me
They need to see me clearly
Who I am, where I'm from
Where I've been and where I'm trying to go to
They need to understand that
This ain't the kind of feel that
You can stroll, you can cruise
You gotta keep on pushing
I'm dying in the middle and I try to choose my line
Climbing up the ladder and the whole thing get strange
This situation that me have to pass through
Educating myself on all the things what to do
Minimizing all my risk that I'm passing through
Heads up me wonder bout the things not me do
Never ever let nobody take your dream from you
Keep your sight on your goal and keep on going
Pushing through
The hardest part is making
Like when you're grinding hard and working
Staying focused while you're moving
Cause you're cape on, cape on, cape on
I grind 24 /8, I'm giving what it's gon' take
My mama went from Haiti, Bahamas to the US of 80
Now I bring you the shooting star, flyin' high with no cape
I keep it moving, getting to the money, Sonic Skates
I got that fishing pole bread, calling fishing bait
Coming to America
1988, the hardest part is flirting with having no cake
Visa debit, I love you baby, I know it's straight
Haters wondering where I been and how J Dog ate
I been in the spotlight eating prime steak
How you feeling superstar, I'm feeling frosted flakes
Me and Bishop Wayne plotting charter plans
Party's making
Like when you're grinding hard and working
Staying focused while you're moving
You just keep on, keep on moving (Many many)
Sleepless night, walkin' daily
Give it all and me all, fi make sure this thing tight
So me rise high high like united air flight
Me keep on shedding fi make sure me sound great
So me alleviate the pressure now the critical state
Sticking to my guns to make my dreams levitate
Cause I can't concentrate and regulate
To keep on pushing and rising my stakes
My determination was invented from a team
So all the negativity and them losing to me
Can't stop my progress from reaching my dream
As my intention is to always succeed
The hardest part is making
Like when you grow up
Like when you're grinding hard and working
Staying focused while you're moving
You just keep on, keep on
The hardest part is making
Like when you're grinding hard and working
Staying focused while you're moving
You just keep on, keep on moving
(Alarm sound)
