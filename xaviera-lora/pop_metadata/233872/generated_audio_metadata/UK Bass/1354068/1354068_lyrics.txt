Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
City burns black beneath my feet
Neon screams in the cold concrete
Every shadow dances but they don't speak (they never speak, they never speak)
Crows on wires watch the fray
A thousand secrets they won't say
Pulse of the street it beats decay
We won't send shadows, we don't stop
Drop by drop the silence sparks
Dark and light they clash they bleed
In the baseline's grey we're free
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Fingers trace the skyline scar
Night's a mirror cracked a jar
Electric whispers pull me far
Rain bites sharp like it's alive
Venom skies they twist they rise
Only the strongest survive
And the walls they shake, they break, every soul a spark to take
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-a-ah
