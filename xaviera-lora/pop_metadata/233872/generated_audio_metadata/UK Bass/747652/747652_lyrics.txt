I feel the bass and drums we're lifting off the roof
I want to feel the pressure make me pull it through
One time, two time, three times the elemental truth
The time we got is tight, let's celebrate the youth
I feel the bass and drums when lifting off the roof
I want to feel the pressure make me bulletproof
One time, two time, three times the elemental truth
The time we got is tight let's celebrate the youth
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I feel the bass and drums with lifting off the roof
I want to feel the pressure make me bulletproof
I feel the bass and drums with lifting off the roof
I want to feel the pressure make me bulletproof
One time, two time, three times the elemental truth
The time we've got is tight, let's celebrate the youth
Make people see truth
People is true
