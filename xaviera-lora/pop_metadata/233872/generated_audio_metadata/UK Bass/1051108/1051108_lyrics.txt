There's somebody out there
Who wants to hear
There's something happening inside
Everybody getting there
I'm having illusions
I'm speaking from a voice that isn't me
No more confusion
This is the one I feel it certainly
Get closer
Fever in me
Get closer, fever in me
Somebody out there who wants to play
There's something happening inside
It's a very special day
I'm having illusions
There's something strange possessing my body
No more confusion
This is my time
I feel it certainly
Get closer
Breather in me
Get closer
Breather in me
Get closer
Somebody out there
Somebody out there
Endless, endless, endless, jealous, jealous, jealous, jealous, jealous, jealous
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me
