Just a lot of loving
Just a lot of loving
Just a lot of loving
Take me to a place where I haven't been before
Just a lot of loving
No more time for talking
This is time for fucking
There will be no stopping
Just a lot of loving
Just a lot of fucking
And let the worlds collide
Love is on my mind
Just a lot of fucking
Love is on my mind
Just a lot of fucking
My love is everlasting
Love is on my mind
There will be no stopping
Just as I am loving
Take me to a place
Where I haven't been before
My love is everlasting
No more time for talking
This is time for fucking
There will be no stopping
Love is on my mind (Help me, help me)
There will be no stopping (Love is on my mind)
Love is on my mind
And let the words collide
Just a line of loving
And let the words collide
