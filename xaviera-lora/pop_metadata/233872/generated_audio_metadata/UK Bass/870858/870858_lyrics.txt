I wanna know
Can you always be mine?
Wish that we could be frozen in time
Before the doubts are setting in
Wish our love was frozen in time
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Can you always be mine?
I wish that we could be frozen in time
Before the doubts are setting in
I wish our love was frozen in time
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
