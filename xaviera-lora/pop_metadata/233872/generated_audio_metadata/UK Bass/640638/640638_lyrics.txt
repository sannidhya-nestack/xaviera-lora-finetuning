It feels so fine, fine
Feels so fine, fine
Feels so fine, fine
Yeah I feel so fine
It feels so fine, fine
I feel so fine, fine
Oh yeah
Anytime you ready
I'll just skate up off my butt
Baby kiss you love
That is what I wanna do
Just be close to you
There's so much in life baby that we can do
Please don't let me down
Always be around
Don't take me for a clown
Don't spin me around
No, I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who cares
I'm the one who'll be there
I'm the one
I'm the one
I'm feeling fine, fine
I'm feeling fine, fine
I'm feeling fine
I'm feeling fine, fine
I'm feeling good
Just like I should
If you wanna me just call my name
I'll be walking up and down your lane
I'm hunting for you
You seems to be so true
And for you baby girl I don't see what I would ne do
You are the only lover
You are undercover
You give me sweet dabbing
Baby like you're rubbing
Ooh that's mine
Baby until the end of time
You rest upon my mind
Yeah it's a so wonderful sign
You know I'm in blind
It is so qualified
To have you as mine, mine
To have you as mine
Yeah to have you as mine
I'm feeling good, good
I'm feeling fine, fine
I'm feeling good, yeah, just like I should
Well it's the mystic mood and it's the mystic way
And it's the mystic love baby you get from me
Please believe me I'm not wrong
Your emotions, your sexy little ways
Baby when you cross my place
My eyes are on you
I don't know what to do
To me you seem so true
Baby girl I can't see it in you
I'm feeling fine, fine
I'm feeling good, just like I should
I'm feeling fine, fine
I'm feeling good, good
