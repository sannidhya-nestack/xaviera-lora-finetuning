I'm firing sonic shots from a superphonic gun made of love for you
I'm firing sonic shots from a superphonic gun made of love for you
Such a simple ammunition made to counter your condition
A vision, I got a vision for you
Resonation, the remedy, the cure
Got a teeny tiny taste, now I'm begging for more
All the hate, all the pain in the sky
It's just love, it's just love in my eye
I'll live for you if you got the love for me
I'll live for you
If you got the love for me too,'cause I'll live for you
If you got the love for me,'cause I'll live for you
If you got the love for me too
'Cause I'll live for you
If you got the love for me
I'll live for you
If you got the love for me too
I'll live for you
If you got the love for me
I'll live for you
If you got the love for me too
