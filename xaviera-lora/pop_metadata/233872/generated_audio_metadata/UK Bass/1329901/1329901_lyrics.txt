Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Under the lights where dreams collide
The pitch is alive, the crowds our guide
Golden goals and a skyline bright
Chasing glory'til the morning light
Ignite the night, let the sparks take flight
Feel the rhythm and the fire inside
From the pitch to the streets we rise
This is our moment, our paradise
Ah, ah, ah, ah
The whistle blows, the game's begun
Electric moves under the fading sun
Flags are waving, hearts beat strong
The anthem's loud, we sing along
Countdown drops and the baseline rolls
NYE fever takes control
Cities are canvas painted in gold
The world is ours as the story unfolds
Reunite the night, let the sparks take flight
Feel the rhythm and the fire inside
From the pitch to the streets we rise
This is our moment, our paradise
Cheers erupt and the stars align
Victory shouts like vintage wine
UK vibes with a midnight roar
This is the life we've been waiting for
