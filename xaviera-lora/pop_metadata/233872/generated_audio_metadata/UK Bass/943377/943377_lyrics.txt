Like sun and rain ain't no friends
I'll never be, never be your queen
Like day and night won't blend
You'll never get, never get me
You will have to change your pace
Or you won't save your face
I will never ever play with you
'Cause that ain't me
It ain't me, it ain't me who was falling
It ain't me on my knees
It ain't me, it ain't me who was fooling
It ain't me spilling beans
Do you want me to see you begging please
Lose a bit of self esteem you really need
It will never be me who's gonna need
A man who's gonna set me free
Oh baby please, baby it ain't me
This baby ain't me
This baby ain't me
This baby ain't me
'Cause baby, ain't it me?
Heaven and hell don't share a place
You'll forever be, ever be green
Like dirt and sand and like waste
I'll forever be, ever be clean
I won't let you say my name
We'll tell you who's to blame, won't be stopped
Forever in a walk of shame
that ain't me
It ain't me, it ain't me who has fallen
It ain't me on my knees
It ain't me, it ain't me who was fooling
It ain't me spilling beans
Do you want me to see you begging please?
Lose a bit of self esteem, you really need
It will never be me who's gonna need a man who's gonna set me free
Oh baby please, baby it ain't me, oh it ain't me
baby it ain't me, I'm not falling on you,'cause baby it ain't me, it ain't me baby I'm not falling on you
'Cause baby it ain't me
If you're high or low, I don't care
Will you leave me now, leave me alone
The lies you told, don't care
I'll be better off, better off alone
It ain't me, it ain't me who was falling
It ain't me on my knees
It ain't me, it ain't me who was fooling
It ain't me spilling beans
baby it ain't me
baby it ain't me
'Cause baby it ain't me (it ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me, it ain' me, it ain't me, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't)
baby it ain't me (it ain' me, it ain' me, it ain' me, it ain' me, it ain' me, it ain't, it ain' me, it ain' me)
baby it ain't me (it ain', it ain', it ain', it ain' me, it ain' me, it ain', it ain', it ain', it ain', it ain')
baby it ain't me
Like sun and rain I know friends
I'll never be, never be a queen
Like day and night one plan
You'll never get, never get me
