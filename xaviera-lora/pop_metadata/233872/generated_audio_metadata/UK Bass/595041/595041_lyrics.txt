Just tell me one thing, love
You're going out there to destroy the world, right?
Not to study, not to bring back
But to wipe them out, that's the plan
Aliens this time each week
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman
(Gunshots)
I got signals, I got readings, front and behind, there's nothing back here, look I'm telling you, there's nothing moving and it ain't us, it's moving along this place, get the hell out of there, get out of there, get out of there, get out of there, get out of there, get out of there, get out of there, get out of there, get out of there, get out of there
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, yeah, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Don't you know I can't keep it at love
Don't you know I can't keep it at love
Don't you know I can't keep it at love
Don't you know I can't keep it at love
Don't you know I can't keep it at love
Don't you know I can't keep it at love
Don't know me
But who knows?
Don't know me
I don't get down, get up, who knows?
I don't get down, who's gonna make?
I don't get down, get up, who knows?
I don't get down, who's gonna make
I don't get down, get up, who knows?
I don't get down, who's gonna make
I don't get down, get up, who knows?
I don't get down, who's gonna make
I don't get down, get up, who's gonna make?
I don't get down, who's gonna make
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out of my life (x3)
