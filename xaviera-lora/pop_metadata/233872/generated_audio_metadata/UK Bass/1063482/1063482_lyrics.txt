It's late, but I don't wanna sleep
I'm riding high, can touch the sky
Won't catch me counting sheep
Feel like there's magic in the air
As if the fun has just begun
And there's more that we can share, woah-oh
So won't you come get lost with me
Won't you come get lost with me
Maybe I can set you free
Maybe I can set you free
Won't you come get lost with me
Won't you come get lost with me
We can stay awake all through the night
Until first light
Until first light
Until first light
Until first light
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, until first light
You know that I don't wanna leave
Take every clock, make them stop
We'll live forever, you and me
we'll make the whole world disappear
For here and now is all that counts
Until the sun appears
Won't you come get lost with me
Won't you come get lost with me
Maybe I can set you free
Maybe I can set you free
Won't you come get lost with me
Won't you come get lost with me
We can stay awake all through the night
Until the starlight
Until first light, until first light, ooh
