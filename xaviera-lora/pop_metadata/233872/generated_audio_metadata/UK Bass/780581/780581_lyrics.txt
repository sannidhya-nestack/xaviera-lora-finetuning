End the moment, end the moment, end the moment, end the moment
End the moment, end the moment, end the moment, end the moment
In the moment, in the moment, in the moment, in the moment
Hold your breath
In the moment, in the moment, in the moment, in the moment, in the moment
End the moment, end the moment, oh end it
End the moment, end the moment, end the moment, end the moment
Pull your love in the moment, in the moment, in the moment
Hold me close in the moment, in the moment, in the moment
Pull your love in the moment, in the moment in the moment
Hold me close, end the moment, end the moment, end the moment, hold me love, end the moment, end the moment, end the moment, end the moment, end the moment, hold me love, end the moment, end the moment, end the moment, hold me love
And a moment, and a moment, and a moment, and a moment
End the moment, end the moment, hold me back
End the moment, end the moment, end the moment, end the moment
End the moment, end the moment, end the moment, end the moment
In the moment, in the moment, in the moment
