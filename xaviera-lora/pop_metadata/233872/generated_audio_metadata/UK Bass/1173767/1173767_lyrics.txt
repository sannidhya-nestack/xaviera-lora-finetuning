C to the X, beauty and the beat.
I cut the talk and I take it to the top
Cannot stop hip hop it's in me
All I see is rappers
Rappers rockin' the india
My changes with my beautiful tactics
And I hold all the patents
Ok one day one day one day in isoba
Living missing in action
Lost too many patients
I became an assassin
Lord ive me if I'm drinking the poison
And it's not even often I'm coughing it out
My creation is ancient and ageless
The air flowing is tasteless
But india nyoge msile ne yelfagwa
Laal puma no daga e paripaga
Imanyangwayazi
Zwa gala, imi nyango jazi vule gela (Zwa gala)
Money already spoke this international language
These rappers are hopeless, these rappers are throwbacks
They won't be here tomorrow, today you're the king of the show
Tomorrow king of the sorrow, hip hop is a dojo man
And I got the mojo sitting at the right hand of their father
Are you wrong Osana
Yes we love hip hop and hoodies but black rappers we love them not and why should we
Words of words saying tracks are worth playing in flag deliverance
Be the evidence I'd be guilty for my innocence
Graffiti break dance and hip hop in all elements
Eloquent tune in the frequents
Hip hop a drug abuse the substance
Rehabilitate with hoodies and hip hop
Rehabilitate with hoodies and (hoodies and hoodies and hoodies and hoodies and hoodies and)
