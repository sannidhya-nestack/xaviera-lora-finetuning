I'm gonna do whatever I want
And if the sky is no limit for me
I'm gonna do whatever I want
And if the sky is no limit for me
I'm gonna do whatever I want
And if the sky is no limit for me
I'm gonna do whatever I want
And if the sky is no limit for me
Who, who, who
I'm gonna do whatever I want
Who, who, who
I'm gonna do whatever I want
And if the sky's no limit for me
I'm gonna do whatever I want
And if the sky's no limit for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm gonna do whatever I want
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Who, who, who
I'm gonna do whatever I want
Who, who
