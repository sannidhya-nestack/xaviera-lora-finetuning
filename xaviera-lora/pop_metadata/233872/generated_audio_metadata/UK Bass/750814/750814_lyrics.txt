I know that you're hiding from everything
I know that you're hiding from me
I know I can feel the anger that you hide too
I can smell it
Come out of the oven
Come out of the oven
Come out of the oven
Come out of the oven
I know that you are running away from ghosts
I know what they want from your soul
I know I can see right through your distrust
I can touch it in your heart
Come out of your fun
Raise up to those tears
Come out of your fun
Raise up to yourself
Come out of your fun
Let the sky heal you now
Come out of your fun
Let the fall
My heart and me are fine
