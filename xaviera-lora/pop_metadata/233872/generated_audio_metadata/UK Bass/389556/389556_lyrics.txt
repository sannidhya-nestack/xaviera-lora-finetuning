Sing, steely, show girl, your red dress is tall
And the moon is high tonight
Time on my side, take my hand, where'd you wanna go?
there's never enough for me
Time on the side, take my hand, where'd you wanna go?
there's never enough for me
Electric, your skin
And the beat's running down, down, down
Ain't it grand? Ain't it grand?
Time on the side, take my hand, where'd you wanna go?
there's never enough for me
Time on the side, take my hand, where'd you wanna go?
there's never enough for me
Time on my side, take my hand, where'd you wanna go?
it's never enough for me
Time on my side, take my hand, where did you wanna go?
it's never enough for me
Time on my side, take my hand, where'd you wanna go?
it's never enough for me
Time on my side, take my hand, where'd you wanna go?
it's never enough for me
Time on my side, take my hand, where do you wanna go?
it's never enough for me
Time on my side, take my hand, where'd you want to go?
there's never enough for me
Your Aunt Jessie stole
Time on my side, take my hand, where did you want to go?
there's never enough for me
Time on my side, take my hand, where'd you wanna go?'Cause there's never enough for me
Time on my side, take my hand, where' you wanna go? There's never enough for me
