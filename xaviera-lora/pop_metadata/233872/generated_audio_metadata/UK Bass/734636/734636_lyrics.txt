Once upon a time I was alone
There was no one beside me
Everything I did was on my own
Why should I care I was free
But then I watched you in the rain
I saw an angel standing
There was nothing left to gain
That's how the story's ending now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
I saw an angel standing
I saw an angel standing
I saw an angel standing
That's how the story's ending now
Ending now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep
Once upon a time I was alone
There was no one beside me
Everything I did was on my own
Why should I care I was free
But then I watched you in the rain
I saw an angel standing
There was nothing left to gain
That's how the story's ending now
