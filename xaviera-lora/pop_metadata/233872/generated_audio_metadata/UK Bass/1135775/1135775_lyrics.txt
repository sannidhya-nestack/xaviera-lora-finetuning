I should really be moving on
I should really be on my way
Wish that I could get you off my mind
Wish that I could find myself again
Wish that things could be the way they were
Wish that I could be more than a friend
Wish you didn't have to go to her
Wish there was a way I could explain
But you don't call anymore anyway
We don't talk anymore at all
You don't call anymore anyway
I should really be moving on
You don't call anymore anyway
We don't really talk no more at all
You don't call anyway, I should really be moving on, should be moving on
You don't call anymore anyway
I can't see you
You still call my name
I can't feel you
You still call my name
I can't feel you
You still call my name
I can't hear you
You still call my name
You still call my name
I should really be moving on
I should really be on my way
Wish that I could get you off my mind
Wish that I could find myself again
I should really be moving on
I should really be on my way
Wish that I could get you off my mind
Wish that I could find myself again
You don't belong anymore anywhere
You don't call anymore
