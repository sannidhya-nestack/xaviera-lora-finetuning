Hey Lee, I've been pissed off listening to Rick Ross
Hey Lee, I've been pissed off listening to Rick Ross
90 miles feels right
Gotta grip the wheel tight
Speed it fast and end it
If the wind blows through the trees right
Got no internet
I'ma run the darkin
Call when I get back
I brought you some
Ay Lee I've been pissed off this ain't no rep ross
Ay Lee I've been pissed off this ain't no rep ross
Ay Lee I've been pissed off this ain't a rep ross
Ay Lee I've been pissed off this ain't not a rep ross
Lately I've been pissed off, pissing in the red cross
Lately I've been pissed off, pissing in the red cross
Lately I've been pissed off, pissing on the red cross
Lately I've been pissed off, pissing on the red cross
In the end of the world
In the end of the world
