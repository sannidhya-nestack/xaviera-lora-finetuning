You're always saying to come home
To get a job on 95
et my dreams, put them aside
I'm done carrying the burden
All the negative dysfunction
All the hurt and self destruction
They'll never stop me
I don't know who I think I am
Acting with such audacity
My dreams are not reality
I'm done carrying the burden
All the negative dysfunction
All the hurt and self destruction
They'll never stop me
