I don't know, I don't care, I feel us touching the air
Tonight
We were one, we are two, I see us touching the stars
Tonight
If it's there for you, it's there for me
If it's there for you, it's there for me
We're almost there
We're almost there
I don't know, I don't care
I feel us touch in the air
Tonight
We were one, we are two
I see us touch in the stars
Tonight
If it's there for you, it's there for me
If it's there for you, it's there for me
We're almost there
We're almost there
If it's there for you, it's there for me
If it's there for you, it's there for me
If it's there for you, it's there for me
We're almost there tonight
Tonight
