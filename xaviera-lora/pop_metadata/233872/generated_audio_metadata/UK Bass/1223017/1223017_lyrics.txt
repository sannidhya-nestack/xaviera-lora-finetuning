Night time, all I did was wait for you
Night I'm back
Night time, all I did was wait for you
Night I'm back
Night time, all I did was wait for you
Night I'm back
Dark skies, cold dreams, lost in time
The wind, the ice, they never leave
Everything was made for you
Everything was made for you
Everything was made for you
Night and day
Wait for you, never leave
That's how all I did was wait for you
Night and day
That's how all I did was wait for you
Night and day
That time, oh, when it was with you
Night, night, night
