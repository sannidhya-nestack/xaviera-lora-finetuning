Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-da-ring
Got a dawn in my brain
How it's doing everyday
Just to make you look at me
Gotta win the game
I don't mind trying again
If I don't last, I blame this on possibility
I don't know if I'll see you again
Or this is the end, I don't know
Stabbed in the loony and planned it down in my brain
I was doing something just to make you laugh
In the turn red and blue again I tell the truth as never to lose will
Already gone and it's late so it's best that I be home you told me to let go
In the turn red and blue again I tell the truth as never to lose will
Already gone and it's late so it's best that I be home I'll live until I know
Telling me where I am, turn it down, keep on praying
Always doing silly things just to make you look at me
Could I win the game, but I might drag on
If I won't last a while, there's a possibility
How then I'll live, you'll see again
Or this is the end, I don't know
Standing in the rain, laying it down in my brain
I was told some things just seem to go wrong
In between red and blue, yeah
Tell the truth, there's nothing to lose but
Party gone, it's late so it's best that I be home
You told me to let go
In between red and blue, yeah
Tell the truth, there's nothing to lose but
Party gone, it's late so it's best that I be home
I'll leave you to it now
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
You look at me, I'm so lonely
You look at me, I'm so lonely
Possibility
Possibility
