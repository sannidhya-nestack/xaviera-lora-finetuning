For a ride babe
No problem, no problem
Where you wanna go
Uptown, downtown let me know
Cause baby girl I just wanna show you that I really got the flow
I wanted you to know
How much I've been thinking of you
You seem to be so true
You're someone who will never make me sad
And you'll never make me blue
So baby there is nothing that I wouldn't do
I will swim across the sea
I will chat over the hills
I will go down in the valley
Because I need someone like you to make me happy
Honey if you really understand how I feel
I wanna stick to you just like a magnet to steel
I wanna let you know baby that I'm really true to you
And I'll never wanna see you sad and blue
That's what I'll do
Give all my love to you
Give all my love to you
Give all my love to you
