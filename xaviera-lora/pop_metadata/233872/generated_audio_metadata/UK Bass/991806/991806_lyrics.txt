I'm just getting out of this house
Oh my God, it's going down
Jumping in the water, in the mud
Head to the ground, in this hole
So find me a room
To find me a real one
To find me a real one
I just wanna dance
To find me a real one
To find me a real one
To find me a real one
I just wanna dance
Just wanna dance
Just wanna dance
Feel this music from my head down to my legs
Just wanna dance
Give me a chance
Feel this music from my head down to my legs
Loneliness
When all I need is you
You make everything all right
When you do what you do
To me, baby, wintertime
But it's hot when you cover up and baby when you put it down
You don't know how it feels, no
Just to be with you
I just wanna be with you (So find me a room)
To find me a real one
To find me a real one
I just wanna dance
To find me a real one
To find me a real room
To find me a real room
I just wanna dance
Just wanna dance
Just wanna dance
Feel this music from my head down to my legs
I just wanna dance
Give me a chance
Feel this music from my hands up to my legs (I'll be a friend to you for life)
You're so, so
Satisfying to my soul
How you let me know, oh oh oh
Oh no, oh no
It's not only physical, it's mental and emotional so, oh oh oh
Winter town, but it's hot when you come around and baby when you put it down
You don't know how it feels, no, just to be with you
I just wanna be with you (So find me a real one)
To find me a real one
To find me a real one
I just wanna dance
To find me a real one
To find me a real one
To find me a real one
I just wanna dance
Just wanna dance
Just wanna dance
Feel this music from my head down to my legs
I just wanna dance
Give me a chance
Feel this music from my head down to my legs
La la la, la la la, la la la
