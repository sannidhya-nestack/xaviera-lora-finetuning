Pretty boy would you tell me all your secrets
Let me hold your hand
Pretty things covered up in mystery
Pretty bad I care so much for you
Those dark white eyes hold the charm for me
I feel like a wreck, a wreck, a wreck, a wreck, a wreck, a wreck, a wreck, a wreck, wreck, a wreck, a wreck, a wreck
My heart is beating fast
And I don't know where to start
Pretty boy, won't you run away from this madness
This downward spiral
Pretty ways are easy to go back to again
Pretty sure the goodness is simply in your soul
Those dark white eyes hold such hope for you
Goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Oh, it's so nice to love you
To love you, darling, was the thing to do
The man who gave me hope and yet so nice
I don't know what to do now
Why don't you meet me like I do today?
I'm trying, I have to hide all my errors
Can't you find me too?
Pretty boy would you tell me all your secrets
Let me hold your hand
Pretty things covered up in mystery
Pretty bad that I don't care anyway for you
Don't stop when eyes hold no chance for me
Pretty boy, won't you run away from this madness, this downward spiral
Pretty ways are easy to go back to again
Pretty sure the goodness is simply in your soul
Those dark white eyes hold such hope for you
I can't find you anywhere, or where you stand
Do you know how long I've wanted to be here?
Now you're gone, but you're holding me in your arms
