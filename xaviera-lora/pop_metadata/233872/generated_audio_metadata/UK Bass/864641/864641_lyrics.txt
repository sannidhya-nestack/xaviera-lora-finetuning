Welcome to Super Ratchet Wednesdays, where shit gets ratchet AF
It's okay, you can be as ratchet as you like, nobody's judging you
Nobody, nobody's judging you (you)
Get over here and do what you do
What you do when you're off in the night and you're out of sight
I don't wanna think about the things that go down when I'm not around
The things that go down when I'm not around
Something's going on but you won't say a thing
You think I'm dumb
Now I see clearly that you're a ratchet, ratchet
You're a ratchet, you're a ratchet
As you slip back in at five in the morning
You're a ratchet, a ratchet, a ratchet, a ratchet
Don't think you don't have to pay for it, pay for it
You're a ratchet, a ratchet, a ratchet a ratchet
Don't think you don't have to pay for it, pay for it
When you went out
You didn't think things would change
And now you're back
You want things to be the same
But the question remains
When you're off in the night and you're out of sight
I don't wanna think about the things that go down when I'm not around
The things that go down when I'm not around
Something's going on
But you won't say a thing
You think I'm dumb
Now I see clearly that you're a ratchet, a ratchet
You're a ratchet, you're a ratchet, you're a ratchet, you're a ratchet, you're a ratchet
You're a ratchet, a ratchet, a ratchet, a ratchet (show me your ratchetness)
You're a ratchet, a ratchet, a ratchet a ratchet (you're the queen of ratchets)
Welcome to Stuka, where shit gets rough (it's okay, you can be rough)
Nobody's judging you (welcome to Stuka, where shit gets rough)
It's okay, you can be rough (nobody's judging you)
