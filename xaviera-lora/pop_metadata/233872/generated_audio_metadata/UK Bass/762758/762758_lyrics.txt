(I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there)
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, oh, can you carry excuses?
Oh, oh, can you carry excuses?
I love from your petty excuses
I love from your petty excuses
Oh, oh, oh
