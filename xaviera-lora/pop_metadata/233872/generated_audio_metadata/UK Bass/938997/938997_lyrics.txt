Ever since I met you, ever since I let you
Baby we get wet to the music in our lives
With my arms around you
You look at you the air pool
Got me going crazy in the river of love
Running, running, running, running
Running in the river of love
Running in the river
Set me free
Running, running
Running, running
Running in the river of love
Running in the river of love
(I'ma say I'ma say I'ma say I'ma)
