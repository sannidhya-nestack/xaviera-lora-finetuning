Maybe I'm crazy, but now I found ya
Now I'm so damn crazy'bout ya
Love keeps me stupid, keeps me alive
Yeah, I like the pain, the feel of fire
Now I know it's hard, you wanna fly
And it's harder when your hands are tied up
Girl trust, trust that my love
Is here to make you come undone
Ooh lady I, I adore you
Got to let you go to ever get you back
Why, lady why, why's it so hard
Why the push and pull, push and pull
We're simple, yeah, we're simple (we're simple, yeah)
We're simple, we're simple, yeah (we're simple, we're simple)
We're simple, yeah, we're simple
When I laid it out, I told you
Try to push him down, I never hit you back
I'm leaning, why, why's it so hard?
Try to push him up, push him up
Maybe I'm crazy, but now I found ya
And I'm so damn crazy'bout ya
Love keeps me stupid, keeps me alive
Yeah, I like the pain, the feel of fire
Now I know it's hard, you wanna fly
And it's harder when your hands are tied up
Girl, trust, trust that my love
Is here to make you come undone
Ooh, baby, I, I adore you
Got to let you go to ever get you back, back
Baby, why, why's it so hard?
Baby, push and pull, push and pull
Push and pull, yeah, push and pull
Push and pull, yeah, push and pull
Push and pull, yeah, push and pull
Push and pull, yeah, push and pull
Yeah, lady, I, I don't
Gotta let you go, I'll never get you back
Now, lady, why, why's it so hard?
Gotta push and pull, push and pull
Push, push, push, push and pull
Push, push, push, push and blow
Push, push, push, push and blow
Push, push, push, push and blow
Ooh, lady, I, I adore you
Got to let you go to ever get you back
Lady, why, why's it so hard?
I got a push and pull, push and pull
Push and pull, yeah, push and pull
Push and pull, yeah, push and pull
Push and pull, yeah, push and pull
Push and pull, yeah, push and pull
