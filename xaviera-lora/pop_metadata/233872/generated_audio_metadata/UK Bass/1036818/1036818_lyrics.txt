I, I lost my way
I miss you everyday
I can't go on this way
Now it's almost been a year
And it's all crystal clear
So baby please won't you come for me
Stay with me
Never thought I'd be trippin' for you
Stay with me
Never thought I'd be trippin' for you
Stay with me
Never thought I'd be trippin' for you
Stay with me
Never thought I'd be trippin' for you
I, I lost my way
I miss you everyday
I can't go on this way
Now it's almost been a year and it's all crystal clear
So baby please won't you come for me
Stay with me never thought I'd be tripping for you
Stay with me never thought I'd be tripping for you
Stay with me, never thought I'd be trippin' for you
Stay with me, never thought I'd be tripping for you
(Let me move)
(Let me move)
Never thought I'd be trippin' for you, stay with me
Never thought I'd be trippin' for you, stay with me
Never thought I'd be trippin' for you, stay with me
Never thought I'd be trippin' for your
