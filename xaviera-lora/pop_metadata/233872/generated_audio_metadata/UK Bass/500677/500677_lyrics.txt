Don't wanna be alone, alone
Alone, alone
Not afraid to try
We've all been there before
All of a sudden we know
Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone, alone
Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be alone
They told me they had it stolen
Don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone
We both know that it's over
So I'm gonna let you cry
Got a mean nose
Don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna, don't wanna be, don't wanna be alone
I know we're having fun
Don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna be alone
