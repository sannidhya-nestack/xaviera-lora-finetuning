Sunshine clouds and blue blue sky
Makes me want to dream and fly
Paint pictures of love with you
Rainbow and butterflies
Make me want to jump and dive
Dance around the flowers with you
Feels warm, sinking right up to my toes
Feels wet, soaking right into my soul
Being with you makes me hotter than myself
Larger, warmer and otherwise
Being with you makes me better than myself
Deeper, brighter, and otherwise
Pitter-patter rains the song
Makes me want to skip along
Weaving myself into you
Distant sounds of waves on high
Makes me want to breathe a sigh
Losing myself in you
Feels warm, sinking right up to my toes
Feels wet, soaking right into my soul
Being with you makes me outer than myself
Larger, warmer and otherwise
Being with you makes me better than myself
Deeper, brighter, and otherwise
Feels warm, sinking right up to my toes
Feels wet, soaking right into my soul
Being with you makes me hotter than myself
Larger, warmer, and otherwise
Being with you makes me better than myself
Deeper, brighter, and otherwise
