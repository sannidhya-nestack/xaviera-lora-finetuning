Streets are empty, echoes in the night
Lost in shadows out of sight
Silent cries, no one to hear in this desolation
Drowning in fear
Alone in the darkness, I'm reaching for the light
But the void inside me, it swallows me whole tonight
I'm a lone wolf, howling at the moon
Loneliness my constant tune
In this vast expanse I'm just a ghost
In this solitude I'll make the most
Broken hearts, shattered dreams, nothing's ever what it seems
Whispers in the wind, fading away in its isolation
Day by day
Day by day
In the darkness I'm reaching for the light
But the void inside me it swallows me up
I'm a lone wolf howling at the moon
Loneliness my constant tune
In this last expense I'm just a ghost
In this silence should I make the move?
I scream into the silence that comes in reply
Lost in this emptiness asking why
Isolations chains they hold me tight
But in this solitude I'll find my light
