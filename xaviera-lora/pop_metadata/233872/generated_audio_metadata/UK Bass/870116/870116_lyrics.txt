Wicked and weird things a go on manifest
Life where we live is like a game of chess
Make the wrong move and you end up in a mess
Life then would be worthless
Remember we don't take off the shackle and chain
We still a feel the pressure and still a feel the pain
For still the straight mentality inna we brain
Humanity gone it is a goddamn shame
Now we 12 dem in the millennium
New world a die inna full condition
Face a ID card now a chip inna your hand
Come join up me revolution sure
Weh dem a do dem a set up a plan
Weh dem want do dem want parkour man
Dem want put microchip inna your hand
You fi call dem flinty bands man
Fli-fl-fl-fl-fl-fl-fl-fl-fl-fl-fl-fl-fl-fl-fl-fl-fl-fl-fl-fl
[INAUDIBLE]
