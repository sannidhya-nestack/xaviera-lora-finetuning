You better run for your life
They ma blow you away
Run for your people
Run for your life
Run for your people
Run for your life
In this world crisis, you better run for your life
It's the strongest that survive, oh in this world crisis
In this world crisis, you better run for your life
It's the strongest that survive
But when this world crashes
You better run for your life
They might blow you away
International anization gonna come and free us from the pain
And free us from this insanity
But they not coming
In this world crisis
You better run for your life
It's the strongest that survive
Oh in this world crisis
In this world crisis
You better run for your life
It's the strongest that survive
Oh when this world crashes
You better run for your life
They might blow you away
You better run for your life
In this world, crying sings
You better run for your life
