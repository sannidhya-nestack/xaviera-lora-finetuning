(Hooked up with rhyme in my veins like a phone and switching lanes)
(Chasing dreams I'm on my own, can't slow down I'm in my zone)
Every step another mile, every win another style
I'm out here setting trends, pushing limits making ends
Nowhere without another I stay grinding to the top
I can't let another block me like a force that never stops
On a mission for that moment giving everything I got
I keep on breaking records till it's time to stop the clock
I'm on it (here I go)
I'm on it (here I go)
You on it (here we go)
You on it (here you go)
I'm on it (here I go)
I'm on it (here I go)
You on it (here we go)
You on it (get some more)
Under pressure never fold chasing glory chasing gold
Every game I play my best in this league we ace the test
Got no time to play it safe every move I'm on the chase
In the moment feel the rush ain't no stopping no one touch
Never worry'bout another I stay grinding to the top
I can't let another block me like a force that never stops
On a mission for that moment giving everything I got
I keep on breaking records till it's time to stop the clock
I'm on it (here I go)
I'm on it (here I go)
You on it (here we go)
You on it (here you go)
I'm on it (here I go)
I'm on it (here I go)
You on it (here we go)
You on it (get some more)
Cameras flashing, I'm a star, people know just who we are
Every moment make it count, making money raise the bar
Every season like a dream, I just put on for my team
Catch me scoring like a pro, prime time stats on TV screens
I'm on it (here I go)
I'm on it (here I go)
You on it (here we go)
You on it (here you go)
I'm on it (here I go)
I'm on it (here I go)
You on it (here we go)
You on it (get some more)
I'm on it, here I go, I'm on it, here I go, you on it, here we go, you on it, here you go, I'm on it, here I go
I'm on it, here I go, you on it, here we go, you on it, get some more
Cameras flashing, I'm a star, people know just who we are
