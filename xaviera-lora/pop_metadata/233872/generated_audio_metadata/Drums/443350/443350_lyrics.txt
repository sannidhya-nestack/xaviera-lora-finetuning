I say
I say
(crying)
What's up?
What's up?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away
Oh, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
Oh, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
Oh, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
Who is the echo?
Who is the echo?
Who is the echo?
