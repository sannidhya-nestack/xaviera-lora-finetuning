Even when I close my eyes
I can still see your face
And when I'm all alone
I'm warm, so warm
In your embrace
Call me, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
Alone in my bed at night
I remember, I remember all that we've done
I dream about the way you hold me tight
Baby, baby, ooh, you're the only one
Now I wouldn't leave your room
But why, oh
Honey, honey, you oughta know that by now
Love, I'm your one and only, lifelong loving girl
Like today, I'm gonna love you tomorrow
Come on, come on, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you (I love you, I love you, I love you)
You are you
