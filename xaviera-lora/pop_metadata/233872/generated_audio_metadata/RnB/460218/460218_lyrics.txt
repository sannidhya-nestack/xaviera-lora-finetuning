Girl, oh girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
Your love's on the fly, your sweet gentle presence makes me high
You must've came down from heaven above with all your love
Every time you smile you turn me on, you got it going on, girl
So lift her up, so lift her up, so lift her up, girl
Your love's on the fly, your sweet gentle presence makes me high
You must've came down from heaven above with all your love
Every time you laugh you make me laugh too, I feel brand new
So lift her up, so lift her up, so lift her up
Oh my baby, I know she's not shady
She comes home with a noble heart
A praying soldier lady
She would never cheat on God
No one should cheat on my thoughts
She is a superwoman caught on a flashing camera shot
Her glamour face reaches out to space on the tower, whoa
Don't start talking crap to your woman
He said to love her at all costs
Even when it feels like you lost a hole in your soul
Just build her up and lift her up so you know what you got to do for your love
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
Your love's on the fly, your sweet gentle presence makes me high
It must've came down from heaven above with all your love
Every time you smile you turn me on, you got it going on girl
So lift her up, so lift her up, so lift her up
Girl, you're my lucky charm
You got it going on my soul sister
With the arm of the lord
I got your back
Your spiritual vibes intact
No lack of faith cutting slack
You'll cut me deep through your sweet gentle beat
Don't beat your girl
She's more precious beautiful than a thousand pearls
She rocks the house all night long
Woah
Trust me when I say she's sweet
Like a sugar coated chocolate candy beet
Her beauty is within
Is within
So lift her up, so lift her up, so lift her up
She's from within, from within, from within
So lift her up, so lift her up, so lift her up
She's from within, from within, from within
Girl, your love's on the fly
Your sweet gentle presence makes me high
You must've came down from heaven above
With all your love
Every time you smile you turn me on
You got it going on girl
So lift her up, so lift her up, so lift her up, girl
Your love's on the fly, your sweet gentle presence makes me high
You must've came down from heaven above with all your love
Every time you laugh you make me laugh too, I feel brand new
So lift her up, so lift her up, so lift her up
