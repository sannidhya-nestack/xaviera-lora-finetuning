I wear my heart on my sleeve, I know that it's over
lately you've been giving me the coldest of shoulders
And sometimes I am too much, I know that I'm focused
And lately you've been calling her name and yeah I know this
Take it for what it is, it's not the same
Take it for what it is, it's not the same
Take it for what it is, I'm not the same
Girl that I was, we're falling out of love
I wear my heart on my sleeve, I know that it's over
lately you've been giving me the coldest of shoulders
And sometimes I am too much, I know that I'm focused
And lately you've been calling her name and yeah I notice
Take it for what it is
It's not the same
Take it for what it is
It's not the same
Take it for what it is
I'm not the same
Girl that I was with falling out of love
My stomach is in my throat, I know that you chose her
lately it don't feel the same when we're getting closer
And sometimes I'm out of reach, I know that I'm up there
And lately you've been ignorant and that is just unfair
Take it for what it is, it's not the same
Take it for what it is, it's not the same
Take it for what it is, I'm not the same
Girl that I was was falling out of love
Take it for what it is, it's not the same
Take it for what it is, it's not the same
Take it for what it is, I'm not the same
Girl than I was before and I don't know
Take it for what it is, it's not the same
Take it for what it is, it's not the same
Take it for what it is, I'm not the same
Girl that I was, we're falling out of love
