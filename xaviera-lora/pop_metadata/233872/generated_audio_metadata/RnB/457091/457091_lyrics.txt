It's only been a short time
I can't get you out of my mind
Baby just keep talking
And when you smile
I can't deny
I'm falling in love with you tonight
Won't you be mine
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Baby (baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Mm-hmm
Free your mind
Won't you be mine
Baby be mine
Won't you be mine
