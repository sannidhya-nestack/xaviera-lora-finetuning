I just wanna feel your waves
Dive in into my soul
I just wanna dance until I lose control
Give me some good sounds
Give me some more, this groove turns me on
So hard I just can't stop my feet keep moving on
On and on and on and on
Give me some basslines
Give me some more
Let's dance, let's jump, let's fly away high in the sky
Get some air, move your hips, you'll get your game, feel the beat
You gotta hold on'cause we'll dance the night away
Let us dive into the pool of bruise
Music and this feeling, there's something's flying
It's hot, just shake, come on, don't stop
Keep on moving, play the next song
Let's dance, let's jump, let's fly away
High in the sky
Get some air, move your hips, et your cape, feel the beat
You got a hold of us, we'll dance the night away
Let's dive into the pool of bruise
Music can just fill in the zone
This floor is hot, just shake'em on
Don't stop, keep on moving, play the next song
I'm dying to start
To feel you by my side
I hope you stay with me
you make me feel alive
Let's meet at home tonight
Or see you at the club
I hope we are together
You and I will make it right
You're the motion of my soul
My way of life, my heart
You make me feel on a natural high
Give me some good times
Give me some more
Give me some basslines
Let's dance, let's jump, let's fly away high in the sky
Get some air, move your hips, et your pain, feel the beat
You gotta hold on'cause we'll dance the night away
Let's dive into the pool of grooves
Music and this feeling there's on this floor
It's hot, just shake, come on, don't stop
Keep on moving, play the next song
Let's dance, let's jump, let's fly away
High in the sky
Get some air, move your hips, et your pain
Feel the beat, you gotta hold on
we'll dance the night away
Let's dive into the pool of bruise
Music ends, I'm spinning, there's nothing slow, it's hot, you're sick, come on, don't stop
Keep on moving, play the next song (Let's dance, let's jump)
Let's dance, let's jump, let's dance, let's jump, let's dance (let's dance, let's jump, let's dance) (let's dance, let's jump) (let's dance, let's jump) (let's dance, let's jump) (let's dance, let's jump) (let's dance, let's jump) (let's dance, let's jump) (let's dance, let's jump) (let's dance, let's jump) (let's dance, let's jump) (let's dance, let's jump)
