Now's our time, there's no slowing down, babe
We are the people over you
Don't look back, it's a roller coaster, baby
We are the everlasting truth
And so we sing and dance
Never think about tomorrow, what it brings
For now we're living in the moment
Don't want to take a chance
We're moving with the future in our hands
So now we're living for the moment
Off ahead I can see through all the miles
This is the pattern which I choose
Once I'm down I'm just getting started
Now I've got nothing left to lose
And so we sing and dance
Never think about tomorrow or what it brings
But now we're living in the moment
So won't you take a chance?
We're moving with the future in our hands
So now we're living for the moment
Now's our time, there's no slowing down babe
We are the people over you
Don't look back, it's a rollercoaster, baby
We are the everlasting truth
And so we sing and dance
Never think about tomorrow, what it brings
For now, we're living in the moment
We won't you take a chance
We're moving with the future in our hands
So now, we're living for the moment
