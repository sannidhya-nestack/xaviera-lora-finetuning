Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, some people wanna take it slow
I'ma rock it all night though
I'm gonna let my hair down low
Down to the floor
You know it's sweet, you know it's sticky
Mmm, it's tasty and it's sticky
Mmm, a little fizzy, a little tingly
Oh, are you with me?
Raspberries, Chocolatini
Hot bikini, I stay steamy
Little cocktail in my hand
Yeah, I got it on demand
Take a dip, let me get you wet
Drip, drip, let me make you sweat
You can get it any way you want
Any way you want, shake it not stir it
Pinky out make them slur, ooh yeah now it's my turn
When I do it I make it burn
Raspberry Chocolatini
Hot bikini, I stay steamy
Little cocktail in my hand
Yeah I got it on demand
Slide it over, let it splash
Velvet kisses, midnight flash
You and me in velvet scenes
Dancing through our sugar dreams
So sip it slow or chug it fast
This kinda love is built to last
Raspberry lips or chocolate teas
Come on baby, drink up the breeze
Raspberry Chocotini
Come on baby, I'm so dreamy
Raspberry Chocotini
Come on baby, I'm so dreamy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
