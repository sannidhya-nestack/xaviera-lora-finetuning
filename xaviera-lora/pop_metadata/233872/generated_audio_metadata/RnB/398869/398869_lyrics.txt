It's written all over my face
I'm tired of feeling like a fool
Just show me the way
I just need to know the rules
Just trying to understand
Which boundaries not to breach
Sufficiently broken down
And now I ain't hard to tease
If you bend me to your will
My mind's open to fill
Then I'm easy to console
No need to behold, no, mm-hmm
I can't walk on my own
Got to find a way not to be alone
Just show me your truth
And I'll do the best I can to make it my own
Cause nothing I can ever do or say is worthy of consideration
So hey, tell me what I gotta do or say to rectify the situation
Left that fire behind and that silly little backbone
Just make up my mind, I clearly can't do it alone
Just trying to understand when I need to bend and bow
Baby ring the dinner bell, so I can come running for the child
Put me in my place
My mind has been erased
Now I'm easy to console
No need to be whole, no
I can't walk on my own
Got to find a way not to be alone
Just show, show me you're true
I'll do the best I can, but making my own
Is nothing I can ever do or say
It's worthy of consideration, so hey
Tell me what I gotta do or say
To rectify the situation
I'm broken
Like a rainbow with no water
And I know we can't go farther any other way
I'm broken like a rivet in good solder
That's been rolled over and over
By the train, that big old train
No more pain
Bend and stretch, reach for the stars
et about halfway, I'll meet you where you are
I'm a little play-doh boy, easy to mold
Just give me a minute to say goodbye to mine
So put it in a little box and mark it with a B
Then put it in the closet where nobody can see
But let me play with it for just one more night
(It happened that I promised everything would be alright)
I must believe I'm broken
Like a rainbow with no water
And I know we can't go no farther
Any other way
So damn broken
Like that rivet in old rusty solder
That's been rolled over and over by the train
That big old train, please no more pain
Bend and stretch, reach for the stars
et about halfway, I'll meet you where you are, baby
I'm a little playboy, easy to mold
Just give me a minute to say goodbye to my soul
Put it in a little box and mark it with a B
Then put it in the closet where nobody can see
Mama, let me play with it for just one more night
And after that I promise everything'll be alright
If I come home, you don't wanna talk to me, it's alright (broken)
I call you on the phone and you tell me leave you alone, it's alright (broken)
You don't wanna be next to me, I swear you don't wanna make love to me, it's alright (broken)
Anything you want, anything you need from me, I'm broken (broken)
So broken, I'm just broken, I'm broken
