I wanna party all night
I wanna love you now and it's 12 o'clock tight
I wanna party all night
I wanna have my fun, don't put up a fight
You say that I'm the only one
And you will never leave me alone
You've never met anyone like me
And you'll die if you don't have me among
Why waste my time with foolish words
And fill my ears with all of your lies
I want the same thing that you do
So just shut your mouth and open up your eyes (I wanna party)
Hold on tonight
I wanna love you now and this whole night
I wanna party
Hold on tonight
I wanna have fun, I'm gonna pull up a fight
I know what I want when I want it
Don't need you to make up my mind
Tonight you are what's caught my eye
But who knows what tomorrow I'll find
I used to live for someone else
Now I only live for myself
There's nothing quite like being free
So don't hold me back
Just come party with me (I wanna party)
All night
I wanna love you now and so tight
I wanna party
All night
I wanna have my fun no more love and fight
I wanna party
All night
I wanna love you now in this cold night
I wanna party
All night
I wanna have my fun don't pull up and slide
I wanna party
All night
I wanna love you now in this cold night
I wanna party
All night
I wanna have my fun, don't put up a fight
Why waste my time?
With foolish words
I want the same thing that you do
So just shut your mouth and open up your eyes
I wanna party all night
I wanna love you now and hold you tight
I wanna party all night
I wanna have my fun, don't put up a fight
I wanna party all night
I wanna love you now and this whole night
I wanna party all night
I wanna be tight, I'll be tight, with you baby all night
I wanna party
All night
I wanna love you now in this coldest night
I wanna party
All night
I wanna have my solo love despite
I wanna party
All night
I wanna love you now in this coldest night
I wanna party
All night
