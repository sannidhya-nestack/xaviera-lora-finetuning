Too many memories dwell in my room
Too many roses with faded perfume
Pressed in my diary
Remembrance of the past
But you promised, darling
That our love would always last
Too many love notes
Signed with your name
I get no pleasure
From knowing who's to blame?
Friends were well meaning when they broke us apart
But friends never know how to mend a broken heart
Slip away, slip away
How did our love slip away? (slip away)
One moment, sweethearts
Then right through our hands
Love slipped away
Like the silvery sands
Too many moments of foolish old pride
Too many lonely nights with tears I can't hide
Gone are the dreams, dear, that I shared with you
Come back my darling and make them all come true
Slip away, yeah, slip away
How did our love slip away? (Slipped away)
One moment sweethearts
Then right through our heads
Love slipped away
Like the silvery sails
One moment sweethearts
Then right through our hands
Love slipped away
I'll slip away
