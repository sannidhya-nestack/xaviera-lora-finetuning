Don't you know, don't you know that the way you make me feel is enough to make me wait on you a long time
Don't stop the way you make me feel
Don't stop the way you make me feel
Don't you know, don't you know
That the way you make me feel
Is enough to make me wait on you a long time
Don't stop the way you make me feel
Don't stop the way you make
you've been running, running, running my mind
And I think I need some alone time
And I'll miss you
I don't mean to but refer to
Always calling you
It's safe to say that this happens every time
You can bet I'm my only dime
And I'ma keep on needing you
And I'll make the same phone call next June to you
Don't you know, don't you know
That the way you make me feel
Is enough to make me wait on you a long time
Don't stop the way you make me feel
Don't stop the way you make me feel
Don't you know, don't you know
That the way you make me feel
Is enough to make me wait on you a long time
Don't stop the way you make me feel
Don't stop the way you make all the time
I've been missing in my mind
You've been kissing over wine
I'm so sad when you leave
I'll do anything you want just let me breathe
I wanna be with you
Don't play no games I know you want me too
So come back over please
Even though I just saw you leave
Don't you know, don't you know
That the way you make me feel
Is enough to make me wait out here a long time
Don't stop the way you make me feel
Don't stop the way you make me feel
Don't you know, don't you know
That the way you make me feel
Is enough to make me wait out here a long time
Don't stop the way you make me feel
Don't stop the way you make
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Humming)
Don't you know, don't you know that the way you make me feel is enough to make me wait on you all the time
Don't stop the way you make me feel
Don't stop the way you make me feel
Don't you know, don't you know that the way you make me feel is enough to make me wait on you all the time
Don't stop the way you make me feel
Don't stop the way you make
