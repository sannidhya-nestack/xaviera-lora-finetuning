Happiness is what I need to heal my broken soul that's been stepped on
And put down and let go
And some scars on my heart
Well you've made a few
But I know you'd heal baby
If I have the strength to tell you
That there's a hurt in my heart and I think it's coming from you baby
And I can't explain why I love you like I do baby
Maybe I'm just mesmerized by the way you treat me, baby
And just a touch from you can heal this hurting, my heart
Can't admit it to you, baby
But no, I'm not ashamed
Of the way I feel for you
Boy, I love you so much it brings me pain
And I'm trying
With my heart on the line again
See, I need you, baby, yeah
I need more than just a friend
When you say you love me, my whole damn life
I think it's coming from you, baby
You, baby, yeah
And I can't explain why I love you like I do, baby
Maybe I'm just mesmerized by the way you treat me (Mesmerized)
And just as such, only you (Just one touch)
Can heal this hurting mind
Ooh, yeah, and I'll give you my time and all my love
with you, I know I'll be sad
And I don't care what the people say
when you come around, the heartache goes away
There's a hurt in my heart, and I can't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
Maybe I'm better (Maybe just let my hands hold you and you'll be true)
Right? (Just a touch)
Just one touch, one touch (You can heal this hurt in my heart)
Hey, hey
Oh yeah
See I need you baby
I need you right here and now
Heal this hurt in my
