This time
Baby put your trust in me
Baby put your trust in me
This time
Since I saw you just the other night
I can't stop thinking'bout you
I can't get you off my mind
Want you to know I ain't playing no games
I wanna prove to you that not all girls are the same
But we fight and argue all the time
But you're my baby, I ain't never gonna let you go
So it's time, baby can we work it out
Since I saw you just the other night
I can't stop thinking about you
I can't get you off my mind
Want you to know I ain't playing no games
I wanna prove to you that not all girls are the same
Baby talk to me I ain't blind to see
That there's something on your mind
Something that you're trying to hide
Cause it's obvious
That there is no trust when you're the only one for me
You're the only man that I need
Please don't stereotype me
Them girls they ain't like me no
Baby bitch I trust in me
No other place I'd rather be
If you give me the chance
I'll do all that I can
I can, I can
I'm blind to see
That there's something on your mind
Something that you're trying to hide
it's obvious
That there is no trust when
You're the only one for me
You're the only man that I need
Please don't stereotype me
Them girls ain't like me, no
Baby, put your trust in me
Know the place I'd rather be
If you give me the chance
I'll do all that I can
Not all girls are the same
Not all girls are the same
Baby talk to me, I ain't blind to see
That there's something on your mind
Something that you're trying to hide
it's obvious that there is no trust
When you're the only one for me
You're the only man that I need
Please don't stereotype me
Them girls ain't like me, no
Baby put your trust in me
Know the place I'd rather be
If you give me the chance, I'll do all that I can
I can, I can
Not all girls are the same
Not all girls are the same
Not all girls are the same
Are the same, are the same
Say, baby talk to me
I ain't blind to see
That there's something on your mind
Something that you're trying to hide
it's obvious
That there is no trust
When you're the only one for me
You're the only man that I need
Want you to know
I ain't playin' no games
I wanna prove to you that not all girls are the same
But we fight and argue all the time
Just
Baby talk to me
I'm blind to see
That there's something on your mind
Something that you're trying to hide
Cause it's obvious
That there is no trust
When you're the only one for me
You're the only man that I need
Please don't stereotype me
Them girls ain't like me
No
Baby put your trust in me
Ignore the place I'd rather be
If you give me the chance, I'll do all that I can, I can, I can
I want you to know that you're my baby, I ain't never gonna let you go
So this time, baby, can we work it out, oh oh
I want you to know that you're my baby
I ain't never gonna let you go
So this time baby can we work it out?
Not all girls are the same
Not all girls are the same
Not all girls are the same
Are the same, are the same
