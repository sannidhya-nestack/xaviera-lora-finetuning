Oh, and night when I lay on my bed alone
I hear the words you say on the telephone
And I can't seem to get you off of my mind
That's why I feel the need to give you all of my time
So why are you?
So far away, I can't stand the thought of waiting another day
I need you, oh so much
I gotta have you sweet, sweet lovin' and your tender touch
Whenever I close my eyes, all I see is you
You holding me and me holding you in this dream I have
I can feel your touch though you're not here with me
I want you so much
So why are you so far away?
I can't stand the thought of waiting another day
I need you, oh so much
I gotta have your sweet, sweet lovin' and your tender touch
So why are you, so far away
I can't stand the thought of waiting another day
I need you (I need you) oh so much (oh so much)
I gotta have you sweet sweet lovin' and your tender touch
Why are you so far away? (You see, baby, I'm goin' through another day without you)
Can't stand it, stand it (Tell me, what am I gonna do?)
Another day (I wish you could come to me now)
I need you, baby (I'm waitin' for you to have you close to me)
Oh, so close, I gotta have it (That would be a wonderful day)
It would feel so good
You would never go away
So why are you so far away
I can't stand the thought of waiting another day
I need you oh so much oh
I gotta have your sweet sweet loving and your tender touch
Y-R-P-U, so far away, I can't stand it, another day
