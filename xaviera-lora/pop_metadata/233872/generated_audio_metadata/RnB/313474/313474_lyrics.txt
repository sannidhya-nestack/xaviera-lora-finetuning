Baby boy you're my sunshine
Cause you light up my life
It's only for that moment
You make everything right
You make everything beautiful
Yes you do
You make everything beautiful
That's why I love you
Baby you're my sunshine
On a rainy day
You chase all my clouds away
And when it's freezing outside
With you it's the month of May
You make me feel so damn good inside
And I got these feelings I can't hide
When you think about you, you, you, you
And all the things that you do
Baby boy, you're my sunshine (sunshine)
you light up my life (light up my life)
It's only for that moment (you make everything right)
You make everything beautiful (yes, you do)
You make everything beautiful (that's why I love you)
I notice when I'm all alone
I see your text message on my phone (on my phone)
Say I'm begging I come hang with you (I'll go)
you know the right things to do
You make me feel so damn good inside
And I got these feelings I can't hide
When I'm thinking'bout you
You, you, you, you know all the things that you do
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby boy, you're my sunshine
you light up my life
It's only for that moment
You make everything alright
You make everything beautiful
Everything that you do
He'll make everything feel a-fair (that's why I love you)
He's a bright, intelligent, cool young fellow
Dashing hands to make me say "jello"
Come collective, I'm impressed
Made me wanna throw on my best shoes, best dress, yes
With my Victoria's Secret song
In my sexiest thong, heat comes through
Yes he likes that, looking all sexy now
How could he fight that?
Body treats me proper still I guess I can bend
Back to the room, room service it is
To get my eat on, and my freak on
Don't let me speak on
I don't know what I'd do to you (let me)
I'll make sure that it's beautiful (so sexy)
Baby boy you're my sunshine
Cause you light up my life
If only for that moment
You make everything alright
You make everything beautiful
Yes you do baby
You make everything beautiful
That's the one I love
Baby boy, you're my sunshine
you light up my life
It's only for a moment
You make everything all right
You make everything beautiful
Yes, you do
You make everything beautiful
That's why I love you, hey
Why I love you, oh yeah
That's why I love you, hey
