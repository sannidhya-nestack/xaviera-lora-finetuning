Satellite of love
I'll be your satellite of love
Twinkle, twinkle, little one
Can't see you straight in the glow
With all around you, you're the sun
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
I wonder who you are
I'll be your satellite of love
Twinkle, twinkle, little one
When you're dancing up the stairs
All the girls begin to swarm
They buzz around like busy bees
Hoping for something sweet
Got no clue what I'm gonna do
If I had to stay
Be your satellite of love
Twinkle, twinkle little one
I see you everywhere I go
But you're so unapproachable
Still I won't give up and fight
Till I become your satellite
I'll be lost
When you smile back and speak
Then one night a lucky star
You're all alone swimming in the bar
You askin' if I owe you a drink
I smile and say what do you think?
We dance and flirt too many times
And I'm your satellite of love
Twinkle, twinkle, little one
I'm your satellite of love
Twinkle, twinkle, little one
I'm your satellite of love
Swing a twinkle little one
I'm your satellite of love (I'm your satellite of love)
I'm your satellite of love
