Beautiful action in your eyes
Perfect moments time defies
Whispering heartbeats in the night
Gentle touches feel so right
Soft caresses dreams unfold
Hands entwined in stories told
Every glance, a silent plea
You're the only one for me
Love unending, love so sweet
You and I, we're so complete
In the moonlight, hearts do meet
Timeless love down to a beat
Under stars that paint the sky
Endless love just you and I
Every day our hearts aligned
Everlasting by design
Love unending, love so sweet
You and I, we're so complete
In the moonlight, hearts do meet
Timeless love, down to a beat
Feel the rhythm of our souls
In your arms I find my goals
No more questions, no replies
Only love that never dies
