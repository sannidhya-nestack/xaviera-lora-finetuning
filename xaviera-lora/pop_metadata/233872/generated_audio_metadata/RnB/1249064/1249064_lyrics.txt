Did you ever have a wish for a girl who could inspire?
A ten thousand years itch of hella hot desire
Well let me introduce you please
To a girl who fits the bill
I think she took a lil' red pill
She's a sight to see in this money
A smile worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She struts in her high-heeled shoes, life's gotten better
She got everything to lose
Flashes on fly
The half-wit in an airplane seat at what cost?
Lost a pretty penny, come and get some
Would you like a little treat?
Turning heads everywhere, trust me
There are very, very many
She's a little more than filthy rich
One tough bitch, welcome to the sweetness
Oh miss money
You and sexy sweet honey
It's a thing that you adore, miss money
Now you got a little, would you like a little more?
Miss money, sweet little honey
I can see that you are fixed
Take a minute, check your mobile
Tell me if you got my text
Flexible finesse and I can see that you've been messing with some things
I think you think that you've never seen before
She's got a wallet that is quite the little fatty
Generous she is very very very catty
Buying up a love, something that she can't ever seem to get enough of
Of a swipe of a card, like to play the part
Crashing it very hard in the market for a heart
Oh, Miss Money, your fantasy
I think about you every day
I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person to a person in your life
Maybe your girlfriend, maybe your wife
Miss Money, oh, she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of gleam in her eye
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ties compile of sweet admirers
They're all just the assets that a few encourage to stash
She trades her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment, not selling just a pocket
Her laughter rings like a cash register chime
The love's a currency she can't seem to mine
A portfolio of hearts, oh what a portfolio
But the dividends of love she'll never really know
Miss money, oh she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of greed in her eye
She's a fiscal fairy, flops are ain't fine
I'm mocking up romance, she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold, they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh how she'll smirk to see
She's a penny pincher with a golden touch
But the cost of love, it seems too much
Miss money, all the irony's not lost
Can't budget for love, it's an endless cost
Now she's bankrupt in the market of hearts
Fiscal failure torn apart, but oh Miss Money
You're still a sight in the cold hard cash of the night
Miss Money, oh she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever chummy
In between the love, greed and her eye
She's a fiscal fairy, slaps her ain't fine
So here's Miss Money, the belle of the ball
May your assets be liquid
Ms. Money, oh she's no dummy
Buy us love but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of greed in her eye
She's a crystal fairy, it's love to reign by
So here's to Ms. Money
The belle of the fall, may your assets be
