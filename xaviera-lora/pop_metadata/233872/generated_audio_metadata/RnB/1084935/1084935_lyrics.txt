You remind me of something
I don't know what it is
But I can't get enough tonight
But I'll tell you once again
I think I found love in this cup tonight, yeah
Ay, it's been a long day (yes)
I'm tryna get you to go my way
Maybe we can run away (yes)
Stop now, take a flight for our holiday (let's go)
But tonight we can stay inside
Have a drink, baby, take our time (yeah)
Pour another one, maybe five
And if you're good then maybe you can stay the night
Pour the shots, save the wine'cause you know
Just like bourbon
Just like bourbon
Just like bourbon
Just like bourbon, just like bourbon, just like bourbon, just like bourbon
Okay now how can I, how can I be different
You're always on my mind, my daydreams are vivid
I know you're sick of all the things that people talk about
Why they throwing stones, living in a glass house
So I'm a loner, not into social media
People get so needy love, starting rumors just because
And now I need a bus, hoping that you move with me
I got the first round, and the second, ooh your energy
If it's just you and me, we should go around
Open up a bottle on the way to the west side, yeah, yeah
Anything you wanna do we can do that tonight
Lay a couple things and be feeling like it's paradise
Everyday is just a lie
Aye, it's been a long day
I'm tryna get you to go my way
Maybe we can run away
Stop now take a flight for our holiday
But tonight we can stay inside
Have a drink baby take our time
Pour another one maybe five
And if you're good then maybe you can stay the night
Just like bourbon, just like bourbon
Just like bourbon, just like bourbon
Just like bourbon, just like bourbon
Just like bourbon, just like bourbon
I want a little bit of privacy
I wanna try to get to know you, wanna find out if you vibe with me
I could be the kinda thing in your life to make it better
You and me could be a team, no running schemes, just score together
Just let me know, ay, let me know
Did you come alone or am I stepping on some toes?
Do you have a minute'cause I'm really tryna know you better
Crushin' on you all night is a drink, can we get together?
If it's just you and me, we should call a ride
Open up a bottle on the way to the west side, yeah, yeah
Anything you wanna do we can do that tonight
Play a couple games and be feeling like it's paradise
Everyday is just a lie
Ayy, it's been a long day
I'm tryna get you to go my way
Maybe we can run away
Stop now take a flight for our holiday
But tonight we can stay inside
Have a drink baby take our time
Pour another one maybe five
And if you're good then maybe you can stay the night
Pour the shot save the wine cause yeah
Just like bourbon
Just like bourbon, just like bourbon, just like bourbon
Just like bourbon, just like bourbon, just like bourbon
