You're the sunrise every morning
You're the clear blue sky
You're the light breeze off the ocean
You're always making everything just right
You're the beauty in the world I adore
Every glimpse of you I get makes me love you even more
Ooh, ooh, ooh, all I have to do is look anywhere and I see you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, all I have to do is look anywhere and I see you
I just look anywhere and I see you
You're the peak of every summit
You're fresh falling snow
Your open arms of comfort, yeah
Everywhere you are, I'm home
You're the beauty in the world I adore
Every glimpse of you I get
It makes me love you even more
Ooh ooh ooh
All I have to do is look anywhere and I see you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, all I have to do
Is look anywhere and I see you
I just look anywhere and I see you
Look anywhere and I see you
I just look anywhere and I see you
