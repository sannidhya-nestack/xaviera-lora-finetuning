Been looking everywhere, over here, over there
It's obvious you found yours, yours, yours, yours
I just can't find it, that thing is so elusive
I just don't want to know more, more, more, more
Based on the fact you did me so right
This should be so easy
Well this sucks what the fuck
Don't know what to do but
I don't wanna wanna want ya
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I confess (hey) I need meds (meds)
So perplexed (hey) a hot mess (hey)
I don't wanna wanna want ya
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't wanna want ya, no, no, no
Don't wanna want ya, no more (oh oh oh oh oh)
Don't wanna want ya, no
Don't wanna want ya, no more (no more)
No (no), no (no), no (no), no
I just don't get it
It's something like pathetic
I just can't break free, free, free, free
This is how I feel
I'm just being real
But it should be so easy
Well this sucks
What the fuck
Don't know what to do but
I don't wanna, wanna, wanna, no, no, no, no more
I confess, I need meds, super flex, a hot mess
I don't wanna, wanna, wanna, no no no no more
I don't want, I don't want, I don't wanna, wanna, no, no, no more
I don't even want to, want to, want to
No, no, no more
Well this sucks, what the fuck?
Don't know what to do but I don't mind, won't want to
No, no, no, I confess, I need meds, so fuck meds, I had meds, I don't want, don't want, don't want, no
No, no, no, he sucks, what the fuck, don't know what to do but
I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don' wanna, don' wanna, don' wanna, no, no, no, no, no, no (no, no, no, no, no)
I can't miss (hey), I need miss (hey), so perfect (hey), a hot mess (hey), I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don' wanna, don' wanna, no, no, no (no, no, no, no, no)
I don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no), don't wanna have to know (no),
Don't wanna watch her no, no, no (no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Don't wanna watch her no, no, no
Don't wanna watch her no, don't wanna watch her no (no more, no more, no more, no more)
