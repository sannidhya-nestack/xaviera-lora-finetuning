Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, yeah
I wanna sing about
For freedom's a weird freedom, yeah
Mm-hmm
I used to cry myself to sleep
Said I would well and I would we
Praying and waiting on my change to come
And now the day is here
I stay strong
I persevere
All those painful nights, ooh
I've been delivered
Now every tear's been cried
Everything has decided
love restored me
I claim my victory
Now every tear's been cried
And everything else is light
No more misery, listen
Because the truth set me free, free, free, free, free, free
The truth set me free, yeah
Free, ooh so free
Free, free
Don't ever give up, girl
Even when you're feeling low
If I can, then you can
I'm living proof
Livery cloud runs out of rain
None of your tears will remain
But that mountain, I'll shine to you
It just can't move
Now every tear's been cried
Every fear cast aside
love restored me
I claim my victory
Now every tear's been cried
And every figure says I
Know my misery, yeah
Because the truth said
You set me free, free, free, free
Free, free, free, the truth's in me (free, free, free, free, free, free, free)
No more tears left to cry
And I'm living my best life
No more misery, not for me
Because the truth has set me free
I'm finally feelin'
I'm finally feelin'
I'm feelin' so free
I'm finally feelin'
I'm finally feelin'
I'm finally feelin'
But you set me
In a life to be free
It can't do the same, it can't do the same for you
Don't you wanna feel free? (Free, free)
Don't you wanna feel free? (Free, free)
It's time, it's time for you to feel free
Ooh, ooh, ooh
