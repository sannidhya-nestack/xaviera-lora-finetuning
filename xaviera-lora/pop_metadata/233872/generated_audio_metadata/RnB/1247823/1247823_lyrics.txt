Got my shades on all day
Dance till the sun goes away
Laughing loud in the street
Life's got a feel in the beat
Keep the vibe going strong in the night where we belong
No worries, no chores just for nothing more
Need nothing more
Living free like before
Feel the rhythm in my core
Oh baby need nothing more
Groove to the left, groove to the right
Party till the early light
Our hearts set to explore
Only this moment, ain't nothing more
Friends all around, yeah so tight
Everyday feels just right
We own this town, we soar
Just love, need nothing more
Need nothing more
Living free like before
Feel the rhythm in my core
Oh baby, need nothing more
Friends all around, yeah, so tight
Every day feels just right
We own this town, we soar
Just love, need nothing more
Need nothing more
Living free like before
Feel the rhythm in my core
Oh baby, need nothing more
