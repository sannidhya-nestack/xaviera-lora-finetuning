I can feel it coming on you know I start to feel it coming strong in me
See it in each other's eyes
How you know you know we can't deny
What we see is coming home
So I strong you and me alone
Tell me how you feel again, you know I wanna hear it every now and then
I try to do the same for you, you know I always tell you what is true, no lie
Let's get it on
So strong, you and me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's coming back again
We win and we lose
Can't be too sure my friend
Ooh, let's get it on
So much strong, you and me, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
We're here
La la la la la la la
Let's get it on
Oh oh oh
We're strong strong strong
We're so strong
We'll
Got it all, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
