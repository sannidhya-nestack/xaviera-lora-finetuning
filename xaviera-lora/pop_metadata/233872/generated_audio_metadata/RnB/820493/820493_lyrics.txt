Mastermind, Luria, what's the deal? (Hey baby, it's raining outside) I know (Seems like it'll just rain forever)
I know this is your fantasy
It's raining down for me
Let's just stay in
Ay yo Luria
Come lay with me by the fireplace
I got the style on ice
Just begin
It's feeling like a fantasy today
You know how I sometimes get this way
I don't wanna go out, just wanna stay in
And lose myself to you
Imagine we're locked in by the rain
It sounds like a rainy day
It's raining down for me
It sounds like a rainy day
Just for you and me
I am the wind, you are the rain, you send a shower like a whisper
Yeah, sounds like a rainy day
Ooh, it's so perfect
To be alone with you
Always loving you
Cancel all of your appointments
I got something in mind
And it's time for love to shine
Sounds like a rainy day
It's raining down for me
Sounds like a rainy day
Just for you and me
I am the wind, you are the rain
You send a shower like a whisper
Sounds like a rainy day
Not for those days that I couldn't be there
I miss you everyday, your crazy ways
It's like this dream that I've seen
Straight out of fairy tale, you press the key
Have you read your email? It read
That total refinement, my body stolen mine
Now we in from the rain, the slate by the fire
We can stay warm and make love to this quiet storm
Haha, all night
Now we're lying here
You're so close to me
Rain can fall eternally
Yeah I'm calling your emotions
Girls I've got something in mind
And it's time for us to shine
Ooh ooh ooh
Oh yeah
I am the wind, you are the rain
You send a shower like a whisper
Yeah, sounds like a rainy day
Sounds like a rainy day
Sounds like a rainy day
Sounds like a rainy day
Sounds like a rainy day
Sounds like a rainy day
Sounds like a rainy day
