See here's the thing, I always knew you would leave
Deep down inside
You never really loved me
Let's be real
We both chose this because it fit comfortably
So give me the real
Not it's not you, it's me
Let it go
Since we both know
Let it go
Since we both know
Remember the day
I called and said I would be late
That was the day
I knew we'd reached our expiration date
You didn't even care enough
To ask why
I already knew you were leaving
No need to cry
Let it go
Since we both know
Let it go
Since we both know
We both know, we both know
We both know, let go
We both know, yes we both know
We both know, that it's time to let it go
Go
We both know
We both know
That it's time to let it go
Go
We both know
Let it go
Since we both know
Let it go
Since we both know
That it's time to let it go
