Just give it to me, just give it to me, just give it to me
I was heading on down to the city
It was 1999
I was tired, hungry, thirsty
Approaching 7 .30 and I needed some to make me feel fine
Seems kinda funny that I was out on money
And my credit card had been declined
The man's looking at me strange and I still don't have no change
It's a sin to have to wait in line
It's a simple recipe but it would mean so much to me
Turn on the gas and make me feel fine
And all I wanna say is
Just give me some
Hot pizza
I really need you tonight
Hot pizza
Come on and give me a bite
Hot pizza
I really need you tonight
Hot pizza
Come on and give me a bite
Now my baby's got the blues and my baby's got the soul
And she's sitting home all alone
My rhythm points to swinging, you're feeling what I'm bringing
It's ten o'clock, I'm ready to go
Now it seems that I just can't explain
The feelings that I have inside for you
Gimme some pizza, I'll put it on my visa
Wash it all down with cool tequila
It's a simple recipe but it would mean so much to me
Turn on the gas and make me feel fine
And all I wanna say is
Just give me some
Hot pizza
I really need you tonight
Hot pizza
Come on and give me a bite
Hot pizza
I really need you tonight
Hot pizza
Come on and give me a bite
Break this money down, huh!
Just give it to me one more time, baby
Just give it to me one more time
Just give me some
Hot pizza, I really need you tonight
Hot pizza, come on and give me a bite
Hot pizza, I really need you tonight
Hot pizza, come on and give me a bite
Hot pizza, I really need you tonight
Hot pizza
Come on and give me a bite
Hot pizza
I really need you
I need you
I need you
Come on and give me a bite
I really need you tonight
