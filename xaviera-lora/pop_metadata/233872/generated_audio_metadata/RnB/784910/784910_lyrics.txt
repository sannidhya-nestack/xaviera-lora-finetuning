All of my heart I gladly give to you
all of the love I feel is only meant for you
Watching you while baby you sleep at night
Laying close by your side
Praying that you're dreaming of me tonight
Pure innocence you can't hide
All of my heart
I gladly give to you
'Cause all of the love I feel
Is only meant for you, yeah
I never wanna feel this emotion
Never give everything
If I could be queen for only just one day, oh
I'd make you feel like a king
All of my heart, all of my heart, I gladly give to you (I gladly give to you)
all of the love I feel is only meant for you
All of my heart, I gladly give to you (I gladly give to you)
'Cause all of the love I feel
Is only meant for you
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love
All of my heart (all of my life) I left it here to you (I left it here for you, for you, oh baby)
all of this (all of you) is only meant for you (is only meant for you, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All of my love (oh)
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love, all of my love, all of my love, all my love
Baby, baby, baby, baby, all of my love, all of my love
All of my love, all of my love, all of my love
