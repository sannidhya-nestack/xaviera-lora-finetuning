Some love went into the U .S. to say, "Babe, you really do a good job, drive me crazy"
You got me 7 .30 in my Mercedes
Tell me what have you done for me lately?
I said, "Woo, daddy, woo, daddy, you know you really got me going"
And you can get it right now
Ooh daddy, ooh daddy
You know you really got me going
And you can get it right now
Ballin' and bobblin'
Comin' up to my room soon
you'll be comin' up to my room soon
Just relax
You won't be leavin' no time soon
I want you
You're sexy baby, you're sexy baby
You know you love the way you move on my sexy body
You don't need to try to get me'cause you got me
Once you get me going you know you can't stop me
you know what I do when I'm with you (I need my peace, my peace)
I say, "Woo, daddy, woo, daddy"
You know you really got me going
And you can get it right now (woo, daddy, woo, daddy)
You know you really got me going (ah)
And you can get it right now
Chica al lado, oreja a Macao, a la provechao, digo echa parao
Chica por aqui, chamaco por alla, domingo Rico America con mi rumba van a gozar
Techo todos juntos, vamos a quemar al arma, el azul y blanco
Los frontes metemano chacho, un barcillon con Barcelon el tigron se levanto
Siente el calor me llaman candela directo del bronza, muevelo mueve muevelo ya
Mueve lo mueve, mueve lo ya
Mueve lo mueve, mueve lo ya
Soy como el fuego y vengo a quemar
I was just kidding, what you got to drink?

Cause I want you
You're sexy baby, you're sexy baby
Babbling, babbling, coming up to my room soon

Just relax, you won't be leaving no time soon

You're sexy baby, you're sexy baby
