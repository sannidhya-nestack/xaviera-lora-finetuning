I think about the girl that I miss
I think about your laugh and our first kiss
Then I sit and replay all the things I should have said
I think about the time spent with you
All the stupid things we used to do
And I wonder how I'm gonna get you out of my head
Maybe this time we'll finally get it together
Or maybe tomorrow I'll find somebody better
everything's alright
Walking in my shoes
Everything's alright
No matter what you choose
It's alright
Everything gonna be alright
Every little thing gon' be alright
Woah yeah
Ooh yeah
Why do your friends always disappear
Every time I try to come'round here
Why do you always have to talk such a big game
I pull in close, you push me away
I'm all out, I got nothing left to say
And I keep wondering if things are ever ever gonna change
Maybe this time we'll finally get it together
Or maybe tomorrow I'll find somebody better
Cause everything's alright
Walking in my shoes, everything's alright
No matter what you choose, it's alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Yes, every little thing gonna be alright
Every little thing gonna be alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Everything will be alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Everything will be alright
Oh yeah
Everything's alright
Walking in my shoes
Everything's alright
No matter what you choose
It's alright
Everything gonna be alright
Everything gonna be alright
Yes, every little thing gonna be alright
Every little thing gonna be alright
