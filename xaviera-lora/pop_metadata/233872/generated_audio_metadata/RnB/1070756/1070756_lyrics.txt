He just seems to play his start
Doesn't wonder where you are
Can't help him on his way
Not today
He just wants to shine his car
Says it really takes him far
It drives in stereo
Stereo
Oh hey
Bad boy
Bad boy
Won't share all his toys
Just wants to be the boys, bad boys
You look and you can't see
See the jelly beans
Could it be that they have been
Right against the wind
You look and you can't see
See the jelly beans
Could it be that they have been
Right against the wind
She dresses in her dream
Can't really be seen
Not long can she stay
Not today, not today
She fiddles with her rings
Brings attention so it sings
Catches eyes and brings them home
Brings them home
Oh, oh, oh
Bad girl
Bad girl
Won't share all her toys
Just wants to feed the boys
Bad girl
You look and you can't see
See the jelly beans
Could it be that they have been
Right against the wind
You look and you can't see
See the jelly beans
Could it be that they have been
Right against the wind
Could it be that they have been
Right against the wind
Ride against the wind, ride against the wind
