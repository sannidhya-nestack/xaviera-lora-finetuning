One, two, three, four
Baby, baby, what happened to you?
I saw you last night working at the blacklight
I admit you were looking for the blue
Pearls on your neck and the boys at your back
Black boots and a purple nightgown
Made it all come together while the club was breaking down
I saw you never deviate from the pole
Your position was sure to agitate
You got the body, you're such a freak
You drive me wild baby with your technique
You got the body, you got mystique
You drive me crazy baby with your physique
Baby love I've been wanting
Where you been, where you at?
Are you always such a wildcat?
Something sexy'bout the way you take control
Of my soul with your smile and your toss it up style
Simple lady with your sweet nastiness
I'm in love with your magical, flexible finesse
I saw your body, I saw your body when I met you in the lobby
You're seductive to the core with your sexual rapport
You got the body
You're such a freak
You drive me wild baby
With your technique
You got the body
You got me steep
You drive me crazy baby
With your physique
I like my shit countin' this move
Swallow that cum if you don't have it in the room
Not a body, not a boy, not even you
Flown away with the price, call it whatever you
Probably right back when I'm too new
I'm just gonna follow along, follow along
You got the body, you're such a freak
You drive me wild, baby, with your technique
You got the body, you got mystique
You drive me crazy baby
With your physique
You got the body
You're such a freak
You drive me wild baby
Where you gonna take me
You got the body
You got mystique
You drive me crazy baby
With your physique
You got the body
You're such a freak
You drive me wild baby
With low technique
You got the body
You got mystique
You drive me crazy baby
With your physique
You got the body
You're such a freak
You drive me wild baby with your big feet
You got the body you drive me sick
You drive me crazy baby with your physique
