How could I not see what was happening to me
I was blinded by your love
The hurting and the crying, the cheating and the lying
All the drama, rock-a-rama, it's all so sad but true
I gotta leave it all behind
It's time for me to make a new start
Leave it all, leave it all behind
I gotta leave it all behind
It's time for me to make a new start
Leave it all, leave it all behind
Now that it's all over
You keep on calling me, calling me
And I keep telling you, telling you
To let it be
I found a four leaf clover deep inside of me
And it's guiding me towards a brighter day
I gotta leave it all behind
It's time for me to make a new start
Gotta leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
I gotta make a brand new day start
It's time for me to make a new start
Leave it all
Leave it all behind
I gotta leave it all behind
It's time for me to make a new start (well, well)
Leave it all, leave it all behind
It's time to leave the drama
I gotta leave it all behind
It's time for me to make a new start
And just let go
Leave it all, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind (baby, baby, baby)
It's time for me to make a new start
Leave it all, leave it all behind
Gotta leave it on, I gotta leave it on
Leave it all behind (well, yes I)
It's time for me to make a new start (do, do, do)
Leave it all, leave it all behind (do, do, do, do, do)
