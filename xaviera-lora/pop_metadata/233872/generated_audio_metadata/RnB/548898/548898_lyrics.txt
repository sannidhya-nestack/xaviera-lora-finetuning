I hope you have got no plans tonight
It's gonna be one hell of a show
Ooh, we're heading to the downtown club
It's a place that really no one knows
We go up to the city, up to the limit
We won't stop until we get enough
And I know you can make it so fall back and shake this
You can follow me into the light
And girl, you know we'll shake it all up, shake it all down
Get you right off the ground
We shake it all up, shake it all down
Proving to the soul school, old school sound
I've been waiting far too long
Have it right here with me baby
You gotta show me, come on show me
You can shake it, shake it, shake it now baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey baby, hey baby, oh yeah
Yeah baby, yeah baby, hey baby, yeah baby
You know we're gonna shake it all up, shake it all down
Lift you right off the ground, girl
You're gonna shake it all up, shake it all down
Move into this old school, old school sound
Shake it all up, shake it all down (yeah baby)
Lift you right off the ground
Shake it all up, shake it all down
Groove into this old school, old school sound
