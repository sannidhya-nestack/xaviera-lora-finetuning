Oh, come on
You know you can't turn me down
In the morning your touch amazed me
You should take me for a ride
In the daylight, your smile is shining
Your lines entice me, you turn me on
Baby please be with me now
I wanna please you, I wanna feed you
Babe, you cannot turn me down (no, no, no)
You never could turn me down (you have to take me on)
No, no, babe, I want you to decide (you never can turn me down)
No, no, you never can turn me down
In the evening, you look amazing
You should have me (you should have me) by your side
In the moonlight
Your movement pacing
You drive me crazy
I can't deny
Baby please be with me now
I wanna please you
I wanna tease you
Baby there's no time to spare
I really need you, I will appease you
Oh, you never can turn me down (no, no)
Oh, you never can turn me down (you have to take me on)
No, no (yeah baby) you never could turn me down (I want you to decide)
Oh, no, you never could turn me down
No, cannot turn me down, no, you have to turn me down, no, you never could turn me down
I want you to decide, you cannot turn me down
