Come save me
Baby it's crazy this feeling you gave me
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm outta control are you gonna save me
Oh, baby it's crazy this feeling you gave me
Oh, I'm out of control, how are you gonna save me?
Oh, come save me, come save me
Come save me, come save me (yeah, come save me, save me, oh)
If you could see into my dreams
Would you believe it's meant to be?
I'm holding on, I'm never gonna let it go
Until the day
I'm never gonna let it go
Baby it's crazy this feeling you gave me
Oh, I'm out of control, are you gonna save me?
Baby it's crazy this feeling you gave me
I'm out of control are you gonna save me?
Come save me, come save me, come save me, come save me
Come save me, come save me, come save me, oh oh oh oh
Come save me, come save me, save me, come
