Everything was cool
Join the service then you go to school
At least that was the plan
But the world started shaking up
And his plans started breaking up
Once things got out of hand
Now he was just a boy
When he was deployed
Now someone must tell mother
That their baby's gone
Somewhere in this world
There's a soldier
Dying to come home
Home sweet home
Oh somewhere in this world
There's a soldier
Dying to come home
He wasn't feeling down
When his boots landed on the ground
Thought things would be okay
Just one month left to talk
Really thought that he could endure
Until that fateful day
When the roadside blast took the breath that was at last
Now all the hopes and dreams from the head mine are gone
Somewhere in this world there's a soldier dying to come home
Home sweet home
Oh somewhere in this world there's a soldier dying to come home
Breaking news, chilling me, my dime to the bone
Telling me the tragedy of another being gone
I only hope that they stop and pray
Right here today for all those soldiers
Who are dying, dying to come home
Now he was just a boy when he was deployed
Now someone must tell him, oh Lord, that their baby's gone
Somewhere in this world there's a soldier dying to come home
Home sweet home
Ooh, somewhere in this world there's a soldier
Dying, dying just to come home
