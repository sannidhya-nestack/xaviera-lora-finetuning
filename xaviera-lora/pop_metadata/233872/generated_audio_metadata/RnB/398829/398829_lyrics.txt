I know I've only known you for a little while, man
I just can't get enough of the way you make me smile
I know I talk to you a hundred times a day
I just can't get enough
I just can't stay awake
We be talkin' again and again, yeah
Always talkin' like the oldest of friends, yeah
The first thing in the morning, baby
Until the day ends, yeah
And I be tryin', but I just can't pretend, no
Gotta tell ya, you're my little one
And every time I think about you
Gotta sing my, my, my, my, my, my, mine
You're my little mine
Every time I think about you
Gotta sing my, my, my, my, mine, mine, mine
I'll never see you but that's okay
every time I do it makes my day
I can't shake this feeling
You're always on my mind
With every precious moment
I wanna hit rewind
We be talkin'
Like it's goin' out of style
Always talkin'
And I just can't reconcile
Circumstances
Ain't never what they need to be findin'
And I been tryin'
But you gotta hold me now
You're my little one
Every time I think about you
Gotta say my, my, my, my, my, my
You're my little one
Every time I think about you
Gotta say my, my, my, my, my, my
Uh uh uh uh uh uh yeah
You're mine
You were mine before grown
Loved you on sight now I can't leave you alone
See I'm a dirty old man been around a few times
Just a few lines squeezed a few dimes
You're mine
Let's believe that's true
All we need is love now all I need is you
You're a shining silver lining in the world so blue
You're the reason for the rhyme in these guitars too come on
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We be talkin' like it's goin' out of style (always talkin') and I can't reconcile
These damn circumstances ain't never what they need to be
I be tryin', but you gotta hold on me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're my little one (you're my little one) every time I think about you
Gotta sing my, my, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're my little, my, little, my, every time I think about you
Gotta sing my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my baby
You're my little, my, you're my little, my, my
You're my little, my, my, my, my
You're my little, my
You're my little, my
You're my little one
