I want to take it on
Oh, but I don't know how to go about it
I can't think of no one else but you
Love it when you make that shape
I must be crazy for even thinking
I must be nobody's man
All things to perfect
It all just flows out
Down and down the vision goes
You look fine, you look perfect
You look fine, just make that shape
You look fine, you look perfect
Make your shape
I gotta get in
I got it all worked out, oh
With the fingers running through and all the feeling
You know I see it from the angles
But you keep on pulling up
I just wish you'd stick around
I must be crazy, I must be gone to go
Can't love me nobody's man
I got nowhere to breathe, save your sweet perfume
I just want to get between
You look fine, you look perfect
You look fine, just make that shape
You look fine, you look perfect
Make your shape
I gotta get in
