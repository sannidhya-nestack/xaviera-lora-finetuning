I'm afraid that you might et
The way we used to play in the yard
And times when we would stay up all night
I hope those memories won't go too far
I'm afraid that you might et ( et)
The way we used to laugh in the dark (yeah)
I pray that you'll always remember
Wherever we're together
Sometimes I go home, go home, go home
Sometimes I go home, go home, go home
Sometimes I go home, go home, go home
Though I can't see it
It's right there in my mind
I miss you that I won't et
The way I used to drag you around
The times when we had nowhere to be, yeah
But with each other out on the town
I promise you that I won't et, no, no
The way we used to laugh in the dark
I promise that I'll always remember
Wherever we together were
Sometimes I go home, go home, go home
Sometimes I go home, go home, go home
Sometimes I go home, go home, go home
Though I can't see it, it's right there in my mind
My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Someday they go home, home
Someday they go home, home
Someday they go, go home, I go home
They can't see it, it's right there in my mind
I'm afraid that you might et (I'm afraid that you might et)
I'm afraid that you might et
I'm afraid that you might don't et
