Whenever you're ready
Where is all the fun we had a song ago
When love was like a simple dance
All the movements fell in line so easy and slow
Let's give that love another chance
Whenever you're ready
Whenever it's love you want to share
Promise I'll be there
How did we get out of time and lose our place
Every motion seems so smooth
What I'd do to dance with you in your embrace
Move into our favorite tunes
Whenever you're ready
Whenever it's love you wanna share
Whenever you're ready
I promise I'll be there
When the music plays, catch up to dance and sway
Keeping time and holding on our special way
Whenever you're ready
Whenever it's love you want to share
Whenever you're ready
I promise I'll be there
Whenever you're ready
To get back together
Whenever you're ready
I promise I'll be there
Whenever you're ready (whenever you're ready)
Whenever you're ready (whenever you're ready, yeah)
Promise I'll be there
I'll be there
