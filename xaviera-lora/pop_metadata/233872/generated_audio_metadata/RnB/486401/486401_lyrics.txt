Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Na, na, na, na, hey
Da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da
Oh, I saw the story she would hold in
Saved it for me, yeah
And another, so prone to creeping
Wanted to save it but nothing could free her
From herself
Then I heard
Laughing on the phone at night
The soothing words around you
It's bo-bo-body lies
You never meant it though
It's bo-bo-body lies
I never think it though,'cause my body lies
You never meant it though,'cause my body lies
In the dark, she was so happy, she said
Began in love with me
In so many ways
The words just flowed easily
Then she turned away
Baby came back to me
A price I had to pay
Oh, she cannot run and I
I cannot hide, I can't confide
In a heart so many lies
With those bad bad badded lies
Never think it though
Those bad bad badded lies
Never meant it though
Those bad bad badded lies
Never meant it though
Those bad bad badded lies
In the dark
Well, the fool so they say
Rushin' when angels fear to tread
Or something led me to him
And I found you there
And I felt it
And I knew it to be true
Oh, well, I'm namin' all my love for you
And then you pierced your arrow into something new
Well, I aim in all your affection
In the wrong direction
You wanted to feel this new love inside
Oh, you would lead me to believe I was on a pedestal
Just to be pulled back down by your body
But it lies
You'll never admit it though, those body lies
You never think it though
blah blah body lies
You never mean it though
blah blah body lies
In the dark
blah blah body lies
Oh never mean it though
blah blah body lies
There in the dark
What can I do?
Lying next to me
Wanna be right next to you but you cannot be
