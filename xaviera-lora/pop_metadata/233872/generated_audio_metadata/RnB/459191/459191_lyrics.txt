Do you know the feeling when it all comes around?
Bars become churches
And you got to break it down
Do you know the feeling
That you're losing yourself
And then when you look in
You find that you're losing somebody else
Your love is all that I need
All that I need baby right here with me
Oh when it all comes around
Be your love
Oh it's all that I need
All that I need, baby
Right here with me
It's all that I need, baby
Right here with me
All that I need
Right here with me
Real, real love
All that I need
All that I need
Right here with me
All that I need
Right here with me
