I remember the day that I met you
Hand in hand we strolled through the park
Then all of a sudden you
Kissed me and you started a flame in my heart
There were tears in your eyes when you whispered
Do do that nothing would ever cause us to part
Then I heard you say, darling I
I love you and you started the flame in my heart
You said you would love me, stay with me every day
And that our love would grow and grow, yeah
No burden is too hard
For us to bear
As long as we both love and share
Please ive my poor heart, dear
Sometimes the things I say may sound harsh
But no matter, darling, what might happen
I shall always have that thing in my heart
Oh Mary darling, what might happen
I shall always have that flame in my heart
