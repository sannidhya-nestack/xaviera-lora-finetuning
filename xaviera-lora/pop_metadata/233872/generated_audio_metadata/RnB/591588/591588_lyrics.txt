I wanna know if you are my love
Then why you get me on the wrong track
I've got to know if I stay with you
What I had to expect from this thing
You're wasting my time
I must be blind
But something inside is keeping me tight
I wanna know where is the light
Of this never ending dark road
I'm trying hard but I can't help it
You are my drug, my living energy
I need your strength, your heat, your influence
When I'm with you, I don't want nothing else
I'm trying hard but I can't help it
You are my drug, my living energy
I need your strength, your heat, your influence
When I'm with you, I don't want nothing else
I wanna know if we're doing well
Now why do I have to keep on fighting?
I need to know if I give you all I have
How come you treat me so bad?
I've got to find how to unwind
A way to enjoy and release my mind
I wanna know what is the end
Of this long and lasting story (I'm trying hard for nothing)
I'm trying hard, but I can't help it
You are my drug, my living energy
I need your strength, your heat, your influence
When I'm with you, I don't want nothing else
I'm trying hard, but I can't help it
You are my drug, my living energy
I need your strength, your heat, your influence
When I'm with you, I don't want nothing else
I'm trying hard but I can't help it
You are my drug
My living energy
I need your strength
I need your love
When I'm with you
Don't want nothing else
Don't want nothing else
Don't want, don't want, don't want nothing else
No, I need your strength
I wanna stay with you
I'm trying hard but I can't help it
