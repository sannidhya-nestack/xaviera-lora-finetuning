Last night I sat alone, sunk in misery (I was all alone)
Last night my loneliness left me in agony (in agony)
Last night my world was dark, but if I only knew (if I only knew)
My world would change to light tonight when I met you
Tonight I see things clearly
I wished upon a star
And just like out of a movie if it is suddenly
There you are
Oh all of this time I thought
That dreams do not come true
Call me a believer,'cause tonight I have met you
Beed-a-doop-bop-bop, beed-a-doop-bop
I'm having a zip-zip-zippy-eye day, ay-ay-ay
Ah-ba-da-doo and a scoopy-doopy-doo
Zip-zip-bop-bop-ba-doo, but I ain't
Tonight
I see things clearly and I wished upon a star
And just like out of a movie, baby, suddenly there you are
Oh, all of this time I thought that dreams do not come true
Call me a believer'cause tonight I am in you
Call me a believer'cause tonight I have met you
