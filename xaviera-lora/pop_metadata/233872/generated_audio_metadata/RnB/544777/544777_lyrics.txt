I've been thinking about you, sister, out there on your own
Are you alone? I know you're strong, keep holding on
It's gonna be alright, baby girl, you got it in you
To stand up and conquer anything
But when you're weak and weary
I can get you through the night
Everybody has a problem
Sometimes we all go astray
But when someone's got your back for you
You live to fight another day
This is for all my sisters who've been faced with hard times
Sometimes a little help from one of your sisters is all you need to get by
Know that when it feels like no one knows or cares what you're going through
I'm here for you, just call me, I'm your sister
You can make it through, just call me, I'll be there
Someday I'll be the one who needs you to be there
I know that I can count on you when it seems there's no one there
Baby sister, you know I miss you when I'm traveling through this world
But I'll be back soon, reach for the moon, you'll always be my girl
This is for all my sisters
Who've been faced with hard times
Sometimes a little help from one of your sisters
Is all you need to get by
Know that when it feels like no one knows or cares
What you're going through I'm here for you
Just call me, I'm your sister
You can make it through
Just call me, I'll be there
And when you need me too, you know I'm here for you
Through all your ups and downs, I'll always be around
A sister is forever, no matter where you are
This is for all my sisters
Who've been faced with hard times
Sometimes a little help from one of your sisters
Is all you need to get by
Know that when it feels like no one knows or cares
What you're going through
I'm here for you
Just call me, I'm your sister
You can make it through just
Call me, I'll be there
This is for all my sisters
Who've been faced with hard times
Sometimes a little help from one of your sisters
Is all you need to get by
Know that when it feels like no one knows or cares
What you're going through, I'm here for you
Just call me, I'm your sister
You can make it through
Just call me, I'll be there
