Hear the sirens, they are coming from inside
Fear the silence, though I'm trying I'm stuck in my desires
Let me go, I shouldn't know why you wanted me tonight
Let me know when you want to leave everything behind
Don't let me fucking leave without your smile
Chasing all the night
Memories stuck with me forever
You told me it's over
Can I call you on the sign?
I'm aching inside, I don't wanna hear
I'm scared of falling yet again here girl I'm back to you
Am I the chosen one? Words can't let me speak my mind
Why I dare stand into all of this
I fly away in my pockets and bills
And my heart regrets and bliss
Don't let me fall
Walking there without your smile
Chasing all the memories stuck with me forever
You told me it's over, but can I call you on the side?
I'm aching inside, but don't wanna hear
Always in the end, and I am, we were
