Feels like this, attached to you like a paperclip
Don't you wish there was more of me at your fingertips?
Feels like this, if you hold me tight you might let me slip (let me slip)
It's high time to wake up and adore me
High time that you focus not ignore me
What's wrong with a little bit of black tie?
What's wrong what's wrong looking for the right guy?
Smooth talk better walk the walk
Don't keep me on the down low you know what I really want
One chance don't trip my heart can flip
Like a paperclip
Feels like this
Attached to you like a paperclip
Don't you wish
There was more of me at your fingertips
Feels like this
If you hold me tight you might let me slip
Let me slip, let me slip
Let me slip, let me slip
One night, gotta kiss me like you mean it
All night, gotta make my heart believe it
So right, gotta make my body feel it
So right, so right, nothing in between it
Magic, don't be plastic
Don't you wanna make our love be on the static
One chance, don't trip, my heart can flip
Like a paperclip
Feels like this
Attached to you like a paperclip
Don't you wish
There was more of me at your fingertips
Too long I've been looking for the right one
Too long, too long thinking that it might come
So strong that I think I'm coming undone
Too long, too long looking for the right one
Too long, I've been looking for the right one
Too long, too long thinking that it might come
So strong that I think I'm coming undone
Too long, too long looking for the right one
Baby it's time, high time, you can be mine
What's wrong, what's wrong with us?
What's wrong, what's wrong, what's wrong with us?
No time, don't keep me on the down
You know what I really want (really want, really want, really want)
It's you, plus me, nothing comes for free, baby
Feels like this
Attached to you like a paperclip
Don't you wish
There was more of me at your fingertips
Feels like this
If you hold me tight you might let me slip
Like a paperclip
