Uh, uh, yeah, oh yes, oh yeah
Boy, I know that it can be kinda hard to handle me
When I slip in my moves
I'm working hard trying to make a way
It gets kinda crazy
Feeling misunderstood
We gotta hold on tight, we'll make things right
Honey you know that I know you so well
There's nothing you can do but say that you'll push away
All of the love that I have for you
Hear me say, yeah
You are fine when trouble rolls around
There ain't no doubt
I know we can work it (yeah)
Though I'm concerned with you I've got to learn
What love is all about (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I know we can work it
Yeah, I know that I give you heat
I don't always act so sweet
Lord knows I got my ways
But I'm never thinking'bout a day
Without you standing beside me
My love is here to stay
And every day and night
My whole life
Baby, I'm so dedicated to you (dedicated to you)
And when the days get rough (days get rough)
Know our love is strong enough (is strong enough)
To carry us through, yeah (to carry us through)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (you are found)
When troubles rise (when troubles rise)
Yeah, yeah (there ain't no doubt)
No doubt love (No we can't work it out)
Don't work it out baby (I'm the same with you)
I've got love (Love is all about)
Love baby yeah yeah yeah (No we can't work it out)
If my eyes should never get too blind to see
Baby (Baby)
Think you are the only one
I'd cross any ocean or sea
Just to bring you back where you should be, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, yeah
La-da-da-da-da-da
You are fine when you're in trouble (when you're in trouble)
Once around, there ain't no doubt (once around)
I know we can't work it out (I know that, I know that)
But I'm concerned with you (I've come to learn, baby)
We got all of our hearts (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know we can't work it out (we can't work it out)
