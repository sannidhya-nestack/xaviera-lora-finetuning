Do do do do do do
Ha
Mmmmm
Do do do do do do
Oh baby yeah
Ha
Mmmmm
Do do do do do do
My baby oh
I'm inspired by people who treat me like you, you do
Our love so real, the answer to prayers, a dream come true
I wish I could hold your hands forever
Oh yeah, how much do I love thee?
Let me count the ways we need a song
Always hear you in those places
Where people need lifting
People need lifting
We are that song
Giving power to the people
A love that teaches us
You teach me how
You're my want and desire
If it feels this good to be used
Just use me up
You're my ecstasy, my one burning fire
I've never loved anyone as much as I love you
You're a gift to me, you're like the gift to the world
You are really the song we need and take you in those places
Where people need lifting (people need lifting)
We are that song
Giving power to the people
A love that teaches us to care
We need a song
Always hear you in those places
Where people need lifting (you are)
We are that song
Giving power to the people
A love that teaches us to fear
I'm a better woman for loving you (yeah, yeah)
Power woman to be loved by you (oh)
To know you is to know the truth
Power woman to be loved by you
I'm a better woman for loving you
Power, we're meant to be loved by you
To know you is to know the truth
We're better
Power, we're meant to be loved by you
All are better
