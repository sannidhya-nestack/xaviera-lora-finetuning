I have a lover near Loch Vaness
She is a real Baroness
She gives me all I need and nothing less
I love the Baroness
She waits till noon to ring me on the line
Ask me out for bread and wine
You can ask me anytime I confess
I love the Baroness
During noontime there's swinging fest
All beyond it where the mountains rest
We wear our sneakers and we do a dance
Crossing steps and stones taking a chance
Ask me anytime I will confess I love the baroness
When the day is done the evenings glow
Sing behind the tree line slow
We lie down in the garden and we rest
I love the baroness
I have a lover near Loch Ness
She is a real bad runneth
She gives me all I need and nothing less
I love the bad runneth
During noon there's a swinging fest
All beyond where the mountains rest
We wear sneakers and we do a dance
Cross the stepping stones taking chance
Ask me anytime I will confess
I love the baroness
When the day is done and the evening glow
You sneak in behind the tree line slow
We lie down in the garden and we rest
I love the bareness
She gives me all I need and nothing less
I love the bareness
