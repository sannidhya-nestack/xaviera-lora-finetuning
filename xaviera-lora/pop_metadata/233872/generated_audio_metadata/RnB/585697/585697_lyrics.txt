Passin' by the passers-by
I see a lonely people who've gone astray
Glassy-eyed and wonderin' why
They always seem to find themselves in disarray
I move against the tide
From those who've lost their stride
Pinstripes and limousines
Bleed behind a trail of greed and shame
Live straight out of magazines
Ain't no rules in seeking fame
I live another way
True to myself everyday
Passing by the passers-by
Blinded and preoccupied
Distracted by the glimmer
The reality, the joy
I pass by the passers-by in a perpetual detour
Backsliders and boomerangs
Always looking for somebody else to blame
Bouncing round like ricochets
Playing up to lose the same old game
Caught up in vanity
A lost humanity
Passing by the passers by
Blinded and preoccupied
Distracted by the glimmer, the reality to draw
I pass by, the passes by on a perpetual detour
Passin' by, the passers-by
Not lookin' into no one's eyes
they're lookin' for an alibi
So I'm passin' by, the passers-by
