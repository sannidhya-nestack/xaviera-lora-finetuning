From the womb, I've been tuned
Genetically profound for war and goose-quake smooth groove
I used to mimic the greats, not knowing my talent awaits
Double dated piano and poetry, then the drums start to notice me
He gave me rhythm but the vocals took over his prism
So I spent some time alone and focused on my lyrical tone
Music and me,'cause I want it, need it
Music and me
I want it, need it
Music and me
I want it, need it
Music and me
I want it, need it
From the church gospel was birthed
So was my voice AM or FM?
What's your choice?
Oh yeah
I was in a man with gospel and R &B
Then soul got a hold of me
He gave me style but jazz was worth my while
I kissed hip hop and he made my heart stop
Yes it did yes it did
Music and me
'Cause I want it, need it, music and me
I want it, need it, music and me
I want it, need it
Music and me
I want it, need it
If there's a cure this
I don't want it, don't need it
et your AI
Black music won't die
Spiritual cries
Heals us inside
You cannot deny
The pain in my voice
Isn't a choice
Chords in my hand
You can't understand
Harmonic melodies
Written just for me
Oh, it's the funk in me (Yeah, it's the funk in me'cause I want it, I need it)
Oh, it's the soul in me (Music in me,'cause I want it, I need it)
Yeah, the R &B in me (Music in me,'cause I want it, I need it)
Jazz, folk, blues, all of the above is me (Music in me,'cause I want it, I need it)
Music in me
