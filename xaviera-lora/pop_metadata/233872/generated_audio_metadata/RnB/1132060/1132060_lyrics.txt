Funky, ae
Welcome to the ballroom tonight is a special night
There's a Latin band in London so go get your dancing shoes, yeah
Go get'em
Did your parents ever tell you how they danced with Mundo Ross?
When the conga came to London such a long long time ago
Funky London Town
Funky London, funky London, funky London Town
Funky London, funky London, funky London Town
Funky London, Funky London, Funky Lollotown
Number one in Lollotown
Every day I see the same faces of the people at the club
Party time is down at Mayfair
At Regina's and the Lord's
At the Lord's
Oh but you don't know funky London if you haven't been around
Bricks don't clap and all the light won't grow over the funky London night
Funky London town
Funky London, funky London, funky London town
Funky London, funky London, funky London town
Funky London, funky London, funky London town
Number one in London town, my home
Ooh, ooh
Latin ladies in the eighties
Guys with Cuban heels
Salsa time is party time
You do just what you feel
Then toca la guitarra
Ay mami
Their Latin look is on the street and you can hear the music play
And now that London's got the message you can start the night and day
Funky London Town
Funky London, funky London, funky London Town
Fuck you London, fuck you London, fuck you London Town
Oye rumbera rumbera te estoy llamando rumbera linda
Pa' que bailes conmigo ven ven ven a escuchar la guitarra linda
Repique de timbal
Fuck you London, fuck you London, fuck you London Town
This is the one about a Latin youth in London Town
And every day is going out to face the rain on the ground
Funky London, Funky London, Funky London Town
Funky London, Funky London, Funky London Town (Well, lots of ladies in the 80's when the gang was human hills)
Funky London, Funky London, Funky London Town (Sometimes it's party time, we'll do just what's still)
Funky London, Funky London, Funky London Town
Panky London, Panky London, Panky London Town (Ritmo rico, sabroso, pa' que baile conmigo, mira que sabroso)
Panky London, Panky London, Panky London Town (Hey, hey, hey)
Panky London, Panky London, Panky London Town (In London Town, in London Town, in London Town)
Panky London, Panky London, Panky London Town (Panky London, Panky London, Panky London Town)
