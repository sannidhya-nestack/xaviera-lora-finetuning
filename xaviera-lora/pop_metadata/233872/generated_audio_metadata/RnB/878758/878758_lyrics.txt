You might think that I've lost my mind
Clouds are gone and you can take some time
I'm floating off gonna feel that sunshine
I'm on a course to perfectly sublime
I'm feeling so good today
Yes, I'm feeling fine in every way
We'll be smiling if I can have my way
I think this might just be the perfect day
I hear sorrow knocking at the door
That door won't open anymore
We've seen it all so it's okay
You gotta know that we won't lose this game
I'm feeling so good today
Yes I'm feeling
But in every way
We'll be smiling
If I can have my say
I think this might just be the perfect day
Feeling so good today
Feeling so good today
Feeling so good today
Feeling so good today (I'm feeling good)
Feeling so good today (I'm feeling good)
Feeling so good today (I'm feeling good)
Feeling so good today (I'm feeling good)
Feeling so good

So good today, yes I'm feelin' (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh, whoa), but in every way we'll be smilin' (Oh, whoa), if I can have my say (Oh, whoa), I think this might just be the perfect day (Oh, whoa),'cause I'm feelin' (I'm feelin'), I'm feelin' (I'm feelin')
