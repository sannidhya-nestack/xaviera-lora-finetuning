Got a mask on my face, got a cape on my back, yeah, yeah
You're laughing right to my face, this is how I react
Just keep calm and count to five, you can catch my will if you catch my vibe
Send a signal to my girls, that it's time to save the world
You can see if you look in my eyes
No fear running through my mind
Good girl is fighting no more Mr. Nice Guy
Flying through the night sky what a time to be alive
No one can stop me now
High in the clouds you can't talk me down
It's my time to shine, must be proud
So listen up and watch me, watch me now
Yeah it's dangerous, so dangerous my middle name
I'm the only one that can save us
And I'm not afraid
Cause now I got superman strength
And I'll use it against hate
I'm not afraid, not afraid
If I'm away, I'm on my way
Got a mask on my face
And a cape on my back yeah yeah
And I'm afraid to my face
This is how I react
Just keep calm and count to five
Catch my wind if you catch my vibe
Send a signal to my girl
That it's time to save the world
I'm not the hero that you thought I'd be
I'm the hero that the world needs
Tryna make a difference in this world
But you're thinking that I'm just another girl
And if I'm misunderstood can you blame me?
If I never change can you change me?
Getting stronger on the daily
Girl I wonder, no one can face me
Hear the evil that you speak
And avoid the trouble that I see
Now I fight the demons that surround me
Don't even try to talk another word to doubt me
All my real girls know what I mean
Fight the wrong with the right, no in between
I'm a hero to the ones in need
You can count on me
Level up level up feel the energy rush to my glow
Can't bend my will or shake my trust
Cause my strength is in my love
So sit back relax and enjoy the flight
Check that stand up and be ready to fight
It'll take a whole town to take a stance
It'll take an army to take us down
Proud of miles on my face
Got a cape on my back, yeah, yeah
You're laughing right to my face
This is how I react
Just keep calm and come with us
You can catch my will if you catch my vibe
Send a signal to my girls
And it's time to save the world
