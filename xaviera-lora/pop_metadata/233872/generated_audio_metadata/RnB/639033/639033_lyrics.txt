Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It was the age old tale of boy meets girl
But soon you left me for another world
When the going got tougher it was time to split
You don't wanna know how the other half lived, no, no
In your ivory tower
You think you've got the power
But I still believe
Sooner or later you'll be in the rough with me
I see you're locked away from all the sin
Rose colored glasses hiding everything
And your penthouse is sheltered from heavy storms
Behind the shutters with the curtains drawn, yeah yeah
In your ivory tower
You think you've got the power
But it's plain to see
Sooner or later you'll be in the rough with me
Sooner or later you'll come running back to me
Climbing down from the top
Feel the dirt in me
And the journey won't stop until we've reached the wasteland
In your ivory tower
You think you got the power
But I still, I still believe
Sooner or later you'll come running back to me
In the ivory tower
You think you hold the power
But it's plain to see
Sooner or later you'll be in the rough with me
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Just you wait
Just you wait and see
