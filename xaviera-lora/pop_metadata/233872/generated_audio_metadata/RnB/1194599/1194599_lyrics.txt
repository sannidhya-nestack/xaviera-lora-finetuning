Day to day, day to day, day to day, day to day
La da da da da
Da da da
Da da da
Da da da da da
Da da da da da da
Da
Da
Day, day, day, day, day
Mind lost balance lately, tripping off it
But that shit's dead, put an ale inside the coffin
Remember them days when we sold in an auction
Next thing you know chilling in the Oval Office
But it was short lived and the streets still piling up corpses
Run a sun cold world still orbits
So I'ma blast how the jack hit force quit
Yeah
Of course this style rather morbid
Dead rising off the ground no orchid
And I don't wanna hear a sound not these voices
Leave em all mute or drown with this an
Aye
So I set it away, been a long journey, get the measuring tape
Critics fall when I cross, give a hesi and fake
Then I shoot, won't miss, cause I steadily aim
Bars heavy been flowing like confetti and rain
In a minutes to the finish, I'm ahead of the game
These bars too foreign, send it to paint
And I go to the road when I pop shit
No YB Yang got a chopstick
Had the whole damn crowd in a mosh pit
I been lurking in the water, no Loch Ness
They wanna put up my flows in boxes
Them long neck boys know ostrich
But I'm always gone stay cool
Rhyming in a circle like a weipu
You boys better stick to the rules
Stick to the rules
You boys better stick to the rules
Yeah
