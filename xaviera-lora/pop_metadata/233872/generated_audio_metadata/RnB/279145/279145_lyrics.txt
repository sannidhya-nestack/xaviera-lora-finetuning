Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, yeah
Mmm, mmm, yeah
Lighting my cigarette in the country cafe
Surrounded by people in love that winter day
No interpretations of worry on their face
Just the sound from the old jukebox in the corner playing Marvin Gaye
I had a good feeling that today was my lucky day
Then I looked down at my shoes
And saw a ten dollar bill on the floor, yeah
At the same time I felt a cold breeze
Then you walked through the door, yeah, yeah
And I went my gloom
As soon as you walked in the room (the room, yeah, yeah)
I'd find my angel in a strange place like this
This only happens once in a lifetime
I'm glad I didn't miss the chance
To find my angel, my angel, my angel
To find my angel, my angel, I never knew
I'd find my angel in a strange place like this
She was standing all alone
With tears streaming down her face
Heart broken so many times
All she needed was love to ease her mind
So I walked up to her and grabbed her hand
And our conversation led to the problem she was having with her man
I was intrigued by her personality
This chemistry was heavenly, I can't believe
I got my angel standing right in front of me
I don't think I'm not the man
Could love you like I care
Baby come on and take my hand
Let me lead you to the milk and honey land
I wanna get to know you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
And there went my glue
As soon as I smelled your perfume
I find my angel in a strange place like this
This only happens once in a lifetime
I'm glad I didn't miss the chance
To find my angel, my angel, my angel
To find my angel, my angel, I never knew
I'd find my angel in a strange place like this
