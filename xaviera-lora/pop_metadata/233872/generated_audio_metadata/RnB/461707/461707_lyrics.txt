Music rings through my mind
Winding further across that line
People dance and sing along
They all know the ageless song
Help them all toward common strength
Mark the path along the way
That leads on to wider roads
Taking those that stray
Keep it light
Oh, my soul's on fire, I keep it light
Oh, my soul's on fire
Paint the house, it's falling down
Floors with cracks that make no sound
Younger eyes hold big surprise, calling home
From out of town
Get your magazine with your gasoline
Simple postcards show the way
Shake it up before you go
And I know you make the day keep it light
Oh my soul's on fire
Keep it light
Oh my soul's on fire
Rolling down the road I'm rolling now
I'm rolling away
I got my mind
I got my sights set on you again
And everything fades
I'll be waiting for you, baby
I'll be waiting for you, baby
I'll be waiting for you, baby
I'll be waiting for you, baby
I'll be waiting for you, baby
The harbor lights break the setting sun
Now it starts, you feel the chill
Place my body on that northern hill
Leave it lay there, may it be still
I keep it light
Oh my soul's on fire, I keep it light
Oh my soul's on fire, I keep it light
Oh my soul's on fire, I keep it light
Oh my soul's on fire
Keep it light
Oh my soul's on fire
Keep it light
Oh my soul's on fire
My soul's on fire (my soul's on fire)
My soul (my soul's on fire)
My soul's on fire (my soul's on fire)
Souls on fire
