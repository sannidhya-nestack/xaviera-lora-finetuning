I'm gonna call my girls up, get my hair done and my nails right
Gonna call my man up just to keep in touch and it's on tonight
Baby come polish my ride, make it look real nice
Me and my girls gonna ride tonight
It's Girls Night Out, y'all chillin' with me
Leave your troubles at home, let your mind be free
Put your hair down, we're gonna hit the spot
Leave your man behind, like it or not
it's Girls Night Out, there's no doubt
It's Girls Night Out
I'm gonna lay my burns down
Get my drink on and ease my mind
I work real hard at my nine to five
And I'm on one tonight
Invitations at the door
But we're dressed to please the eye
Ain't no party, ain't no party'til we step inside
It's Girls Night Out, y'all chillin' with me
Leave your troubles at home, let your mind be free
Put your hair down, we're gonna hit the spot
Leave your man behind, like it or not
it's Girls Night Out, there's no doubt
It's Girls Night Out
This girl's night's out and I gotta get in
No man past ten and my chance to win
Take out the valet, he's about my size
Grabbed the bow tie, then I jumped in a rock
Swerved to the back, had to wipe my eyes
The door's wide open, women thinkin' they thighs
On the way to the bar, caught the bar tender slippin'
So now I'm circumspectin', and lettin' me mention
The dance floor was packed, I mean the party was jumpin'
The DJ got'em workin' like they owe me somethin'
All backs off the wall, with no hatin' up front
In the city and hip, Nauti got everybody buzzin'
Girls that they met at home, it's only friends and cousins
It's girls nights out, and they don't tellin'em nothin'
What? Work somethin', move somethin', shake somethin', come on
Where my girls at?
Where my girls at?
Where my girls at?
Where my girls at?
It's girls night out
Y'all chilling with me
Leave your troubles at home
Let your mind be free
Put your hair down
We're gonna hit that spot
Leave your man behind
Like it or not
it's girls night out
There's no doubt
It's girls night out
It's Girls Night Out, y'all chillin' with me
Leave your troubles at home, let your mind be free
Put your hair down, we're gonna hit the spot
Leave your man behind, like it or not
it's Girls Night Out, there's no doubt
It's Girls Night Out
Hey girls, it's Girls Night Out
Where my girls at? It's Girls Night Out
Leave your man at home, at home
Oh yes, girls night out
