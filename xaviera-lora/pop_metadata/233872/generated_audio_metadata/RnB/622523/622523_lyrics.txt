Oh, something all around this world making everybody go crazy
Hey, just trying to keep my head above with all this spinning'round
Oh, I could use a little bit, just break me off a piece of you baby
'Cause I feel like I've been round and round with nowhere left to go
But here, baby, all I need is sand
And here, after all my time away you were
Mmm, don't tell me I've been foolish
Not to see just how you're tryna save me
Yeah you know I had to figure out everything on my own
'Cause I feel like I've been round and round with nowhere left to go
But here, baby, all I need is standing here
Here I am to make a promise after all this time
now I see you stand before me
And I know you're mine, I'll be here
Here, baby all I need is standing here
After all my time away you were
Here, baby all I need is standing here
After all my time away you were
