Ooh, baby, baby, it's not like I'm not trying
You know inside I'm dying, I wanna come home
I'm not so good at holding doors or kitchen chores, yeah, yeah
Messing up's my style, you should see my room in all its doom
If you can't see me, believe me, I'm not the man I was
Come in close, I'll kiss you, I'll miss you, I'll miss you
Baby, I'll miss you
Ooh, baby, baby, it's not like I'm not trying
Baby, baby, you know inside I'm dying
I wanna come home
I wanna come home
I know it can't be the same
But maybe, baby, you're making me crazy
Keep playing over and over I see the mistakes are all my own
Coming close I'll kiss you I miss you I'm missing you baby I'm missing you
Ooh baby oh baby it's not like I'm not trying
You know inside I'm dying, I wanna come home
Oh, you won't believe it (oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'll make it how you dreamed it
Ooh, baby, oh, baby, it's not like I'm not trying
Ooh, baby, oh, baby, you know inside I'm dying, yeah, yeah
Ooh, baby, oh, baby, it's not like I'm not trying
Baby, baby, you know inside I'm dying, I wanna come home
