Love is a medicine
Baby you can go online
You don't even need to spend a dime
Everybody got a little time for medicine
Love is a medicine yeah
Love is a medicine
Doesn't matter where you go
How you feel it's gonna make it grow
When you're in it you are gonna know it's medicine
Love heals the mind
Love is like a fine wine
It'll make you feel so good
Even though it isn't understood as medicine
Love is a medicine
Love is a medicine
Don't want to share it if you're mine
Doing it alone is gratifying
Everybody's really getting high on medicine
Love heals the mind
Love is like a fine wine
It'll make you feel so good
Even though it isn't understood
All day long
Your heart is yearning for
What you're longing for
Holding on
Only you know what your fear is
Being all alone
Love is a medicine and you know
Love is a medicine
Love is a medicine
