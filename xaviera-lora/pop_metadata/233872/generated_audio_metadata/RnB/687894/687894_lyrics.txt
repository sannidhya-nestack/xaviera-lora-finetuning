This is for the ladies
Bow down to boys
No ifs, no buts, no maybes
It is all your choice
All the ladies in the place
All the ladies in the place
Be proud
And show your face
Express yourself
As you dance on the higher ground
Look to love
And fall to this sound
Express yourself
Don't let him stop you being crazy
Express yourself as he asked you how you're feeling lately
Express yourself don't let him stop you being crazy
Express yourself as he asked you how you're feeling lately
This is for the ladies
Bow down to boys
No ifs, no buts, no maybes
It is all your choice
All the ladies in the place
All the ladies in the place
Be proud
And show your face
Express yourself
Don't let him stop you being crazy
Express yourself
Has he asked you how you're feeling lately?
Express yourself, don't let him stop you being crazy
Express yourself as he asked you how you're feeling lately
This is for the ladies
Bow down our voice
No ifs, no buts, no maybes
It is all about choice
All the ladies in the place
All the ladies in the place
Come show your face
