Used to let little things get to me
Came with a whole lot of shit with me
A whole lot of pain, many grudges
Never really know what true love is but
Gotta blame my past
Too many heartaches ruined me fast
I ain't know who to trust no more
But trust it ran up out the door
I ain't yet giving up baby'til you came around
The walls I built for so long came falling down
I ain't giving up baby till I seen your smile
There ain't no doubt about it
I know I found it in
I don't know what the future holds but I know it's gonna be with you
I don't know what the future holds, but it's nothing without you
I don't know what the future holds, but I know it's gonna be with you
I don't know what the future holds, only thing that I know for sure is
I'm yours, I'm yours
I'm yours
The only thing I know for sure is I'm yours, yeah
I'm yours
I'm yours
The only thing I know for sure is I'm yours
Love was a bit of a mystery
Now it makes a whole lot of sense to me
Baby you should know you're the reason
I mean it baby you're the only reason that
I'm on a brand new path
I found a real love baby at last
I don't need to be afraid no more
Cause you're the one that I adore
I ain't giving up baby till you came around
The walls I built for so long came falling down
I ain't giving up baby till I seen your smile
There ain't no doubt about it, I know I found it in it
I don't know what the future holds but I know it's gonna be with you
I don't know what the future holds but it's nothing without you
I don't know what the future holds
But I know it's gonna be with you here
I don't know what the future holds
Only thing that I know for sure is
I'm yours (I'm yours)
I'm yours (I'm yours)
I'm yours (I'm yours)
The only thing I know for sure is
I'm yours (I'm yours)
I'm yours (I'm yours)
I'm yours (I'm yours)
The only thing I know for sure is I'm yours
The world could come to an end tomorrow
And I don't know what's gonna follow
The only thing for sure that I know (Only thing I know for sure is I'm yours)
The world could come to an end tomorrow
And I don't know what's gonna follow
The only thing for sure that I know (Only thing I know for sure is I'm yours)
I know that I'm yours
I'm yours, I'm yours, I'm yours, I'm yours
The only thing I know for sure is I'm yours (I'm yours, I'm yours)
I'm yours, I'm yours, I'm yours
The only thing I know for sure is I'm yours
