Everything's gonna be alright
Everything, alright
Everything's alright
Right on, right on, right on, right on
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's alright
Everything's alright
Right on, right on, right on, right on
Is it right or you need lies?
Free your mind and let me try
Mix it up and you will find
I'm a different kind
Is it right or you need lies?
Free your mind and let me try
Maze it up and you will find
I'm a different kind
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's alright
Everything's alright
Right on, right on, right on, right on
Everything, everything, everything
Everything's alright
Right on
Alright
