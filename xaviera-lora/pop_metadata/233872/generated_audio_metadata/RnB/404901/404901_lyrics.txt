Ay yo, this joint right here is dedicated to anybody going through something but they feel like they're all alone
She cries alone, but she keeps moving on
Making her way through the storm so faithfully
She cries alone, but she keeps moving on
Baby she feels it strong but she knows the sun will shine eventually
See there's a girl, she's all alone
She has a baby, the father's gone
She's been lost, so damn now
Trying to figure what this life is all about
Sometimes she feels like the world is crashing down on her
And sometimes you see her smile but deep inside she's filled with hurt
She cries alone but she keeps moving on
Making her way through the storm so faithfully
She cries alone, the pain she feels is strong
But she knows the sun will shine eventually
There was a girl, born with disease
It was a miracle that she couldn't even breathe
The doctors say, ain't got much time
And every night she has tears falling from her eyes
Sometimes she feels like the world is crashing down on her
And sometimes you see her smile but deep down
Inside she's filled with hurt
She cries alone but she keeps moving on
Making her way through the storm so faithfully
She cries alone
The pain she feels is strong
But she knows the sun will shine eventually
She cries alone
Mmm, she cries alone, oh, oh, oh
She cries alone, oh yeah
She cries alone, oh, whoa
Sometimes she feels like the world is crashing down on her
Sometimes you see her smile but deep inside
She's filled with hurt
She cries alone
But she keeps moving on
Making her way through the storm
So faithfully
She cries alone
The pain she feels is strong
But she knows the sun will shine eventually
She cries alone
