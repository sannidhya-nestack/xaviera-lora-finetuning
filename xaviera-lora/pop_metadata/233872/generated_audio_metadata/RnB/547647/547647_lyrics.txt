Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, when you're close beside me
I feel your arms around me
Your pretty eyes are what I'm dreaming of
In the world there is no other
You are my perfect lover
Just hold me baby
I need you now
I'm so lucky baby, oh
You gave me the sign now, oh
I'm so happy that you're in my life
When you're here in my arms
Holding me tight
Confess baby you're the one
I feel I'm losing control right down to my very soul
Baby come on tell me tonight it's a miracle
I found you it's a miracle that you found me too
You're extraordinary is this a little bit scary
I really love you, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
When you're staring at me, I feel my heart skip a beat
Oh don't you know you just drive me crazy
We are good together, we will be forever
I see the magic in your eyes tonight
Oh, I'm so lucky, baby
You gave me the sign now
My heart is crying out to you tonight
I will stay in yours forever and never, never say goodbye
I think I'm losing control right down to my very soul
Baby come on tell me tonight it's a miracle
I found you it's a miracle that you found me too
You're extraordinary is this a little bit scary
I really love you
I feel so free when you're beside me, baby (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And I know that you're the one for me
Miracle, I found you
It's a miracle that you found me too
You're extraordinary, is this a little bit scary?
It's a miracle, I found you
It's a miracle that you found me too
You're extraordinary, is this a little bit scary?
