I once decided I would walk away
From all the heartache that's been stalking me
No more your hands won't take me down
No more, your hands won't take me down
I've decided I will et you
I've decided I will not let you conquer me, no
I've decided I will not cower
I've decided you have no power over me
No, no way
I had once thought well I'm gone prove'em wrong
But they ain't got so I'll be moving on
No more, your voice it will not move me
I have a choice and yes I choose me
I've decided I will et you
I've decided I will not let you conquer me
No, yeah
I've decided I will not cower
I've decided you have no power over me
No, no, no, yeah, yeah
I have outgrown your lies
And your trials
I have decided
It's nice to have known you
But I
I have outgrown you
I have decided
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've decided I will et you
I've decided I will not let you conquer me
I have decided I will not let you
I will not let you conquer me (I've decided I will not conquer)
I've decided you have no power over me (no no no no no no)
No, no, no, no, oh, no, ooh, no, oh, no, ooh
No, oh, no, ooh, no
No, oh, ooh, no, oh, no, ooh
No, oh, no, ooh

Ooh, no, oh, no
