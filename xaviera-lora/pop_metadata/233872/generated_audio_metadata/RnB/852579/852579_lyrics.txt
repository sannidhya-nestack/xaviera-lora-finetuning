Nowadays it seems like the same old things
Think I'm ready for a change
Each and every day locked up in a cage
Now it's time to break the chain
Gotta get away, make a great escape, and I gotta make it fast
Yeah I could leave this place with no hesitation no
Leave the drama in my past
It can't be overstated that I'm seeking liberation
Oh oh oh
It's right ahead of me no limits or no boundaries baby
Oh oh yeah
Set me free
Cause I'm fading fast
Chasing blue skies reaching new heights baby it's a brand new day
Leave your problems and your worries as we start to elevate hey hey
As I rise eyes on the sky baby I can't lie
So high on this music said I'm loving the sound
And I don't think my feet are even touching the ground
Baby, no, no, no, no, no
Come on, say it loud
Look at me now
I'm tap dancing on the clouds
And I'm never coming down
Set me free
I gotta get away
Set me free
I'm gonna fly away
Set me free
Cause I'm fading fast
Please baby, I need release baby
It's just me, I just wanna be free
