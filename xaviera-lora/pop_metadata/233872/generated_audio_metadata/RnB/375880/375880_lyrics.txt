Babe, babe, don't go, just stay here, just
I got a bad feeling, alright?
Just chill, just listen to me
You and me (and me) we were meant to be (to be)
You and I alone (alone)
And baby even though I see (I see) why you run these streets (these streets)
Don't you know that I need you at home (at home)
Your phone rings and before you pick it up
You're telling me you gotta go
Boy you know I already know
Sometimes I don't feel right
When you be grinding in the streets at night
Like this might just might be the night
Boy I'm telling you it don't feel right no no
You and me (and me) we were meant to be
You and I alone (alone)
And baby even though I see (I see)
Why you run these streets (these streets)
Don't you know that I need you at home (at home)
Boy, I know that you got your other things to do
But I'm trying to get this through to you
Streets take your time and they'll take your life too
They'll take your life, they'll take your life
Baby, just stay
You and me (and me)
We were meant to be (to be)
You and I alone (alone)
Little man is only two
He needs his dad and I need him too
Then what am I supposed to do?
If I'm left here all alone without you
Your pride will take your life
And how you gonna teach your son was right?
I'm tired of trying to be polite
Now stay here at home tonight
You and me (and me)
We were meant to be (to be)
You and I alone (alone)
And baby even though I see (I see)
Why you run these streets (I understand these streets)
Don't you know that I need you at home (but I need you at home)
I need you, I need you, baby, I need you
Stay awhile, stay awhile, just stay at home tonight
