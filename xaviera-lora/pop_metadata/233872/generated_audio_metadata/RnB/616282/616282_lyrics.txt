Let the river wash over you
See the sunrise so bright
New day is calling us
If we only try
Sail to your dream
And you will find your home
Listen to your heart
And your dreams will grow
Let the river wash over you
See the sunrise so bright
A new day is coming up
If we only try
If we only try, if we only try
Let the river wash over you
If we only try, if we only try
