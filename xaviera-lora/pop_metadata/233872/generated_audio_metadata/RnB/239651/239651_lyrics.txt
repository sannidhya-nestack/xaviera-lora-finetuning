Twelve o'clock, one o'clock, now I'm'bout to blow
(Spit your best game)
Baby, I was out on the block, I kinda lost track of time
Look at this money I got (Spit your best game)
I just got away from the cops, they had me amped up
My hands, they were cuffed and locked (Spit your best game)
Girl, the cell phone was off, I didn't want you to call and blow up the spot (Spit your best game)
I'm favorite to the girl, so stop, I'm gonna take me a shower'cause I'm dirty and hot (D .I .D.)
You know them girls be getting at you'cause you are fine
And them hood rat chicks don't respect the fact that you're mine
And we all know that brother's got a problem with lying
Be out there chasing girls with them big overhines
So don't say you smoking
You can do that at home
Spit your best game brother
Tell me what you been on
Got a singing, crying, hoping, wishing, praying
Thinking I should be all alone
When I'm the one that got your back
Why can't you pick up your phone?
Baby I was out on the block, I kinda lost track of time, look at this money I got (It's your best game)
I just got away from the cops, they had me hemmed up my hands, they were cuffed and locked (It's your best game)
Girl my cell phone was off, I didn't want you to call and blow up the spot (It's your best game)
I'm finger to the girl so stop, I'm finna take me a shower cause I'm dirty and hot
Every time I come through the door you love to trip
But every time I'm bringing you dough I don't get no lip
This is serious it got me furious
And I ain't trying to turn it around
But girl we done been through this
A dozen times with a dozen lies
Girl for the dozen times not being unfaithful
Sometimes I feel like you trying
Finding reasons me lying
Know a nigga be grindin', girl, stop all the cryin'
you're too damn fine, I know it's late
But I still brought you somethin' to eat
Sorry I didn't answer my phone, I didn't hear it beep
I love you, baby, so let's just keep the peace
Gimme a hug, little lady, your friends don't see me
I thought I was gonna be your wife for the rest of my life
Now I'm going crazy
Thought you were my baby, yeah
Now I'm thinking twice'cause you're out all night
And the feeling ain't right while you acting shady
Thought you were my baby (thought you were my baby)
I kinda lost track of time, look at this money I got
I just got away from the cops, they had me hemmed up my hands, they were cuffed and locked
Girl, my cell phone was off, I didn't want you to call and blow up the spot
I'm faking to the girl, so stop, I'm finna take me a shower'cause I'm dirty and hot
