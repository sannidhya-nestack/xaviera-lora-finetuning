Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
Can it be a vision of you and me?
There's something in the way, yeah love
There's something in the way, yeah girl
You set my soul on fire, you're my heart
Desire,'cause you're a winner, you're a winner
Baby you're a winner, you're a winner
you're a winner, you're a winner
Baby you're a winner, you're a winner
Don't you know how I need you so
You make everything seem like peaches and cream
I've been waiting for, for such a long long time
To let you know how you make me feel inside
you're a winner
You're a winner, baby you're a winner
You're a winner,'cause you're a winner
You're a winner, baby you're a winner
You're a winner
Cause you're a winner, you're a winner
Baby you're a winner, you're a winner
Cause you're a winner, you're a winner
Baby you're a winner, you're a winner
Cause you're a winner, you're a winner
Baby you're a winner, you're a winner
Cause you're a winner
You're a winner, baby you're a winner, you're a winner
