Yeah, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Another way, another time, babe, mm-hmm
I can't even talk about it
As much as I think about it
See, in my mind there's no doubt about it
I just don't know what to do about it
My boys say to let it go
They say you don't have it now
They don't understand how deep it goes
I guess that they will never know
Wanna give in to these feelings
Let me take your hand, show you I can be your man and
Wanna tell you that I want you
But I keep wondering if you'd turn me away
Bet you don't know I love you
Bet you don't know
I bet you don't know
Bet you don't know I love you
Bet you don't know
How I love you, how I love you
Bet you don't know, I love you
Bet you don't know
Bet you never, bet you never, never
Bet you don't know, I love you
Bet you don't know
Now girl, I see you everyday
Your pretty smile and your sexy ways
Then I see you sitting in his car
I think to myself there ain't no way
To let you know that I'm feeling you
Sometimes it seems like you feel me too
Or is it just what I wanna see
Imagination taking over me
I wanna give in to these feelings
Baby let me take your hand and show you I can be your man
Wanna tell you that I want you
But I keep wondering if you'd turn me away
Bet you don't know I love you
Bet you don't know
I know you don't know
Bet you don't know I love you
Bet you don't know
How I love you
Bet you don't know I love you
Bet you don't know
Bet you don't know I love you
Bet you don't know
Bet you'll never get me
Bet you'll never, bet you'll never get me
Bet you never know, bet you never know
Bet you never never know, yeah
Bet you don't know I love you
Bet you don't know, bet you never bet you don't know
Bet you don't know I love you
Bet you don't know
Bet you don't know, I love you, Bet you don't know, Bet you don't know, Bet you don’t know, Bet you don’t know, I love you, Bet you don’t know, How I love you, How I love you, Bet you don’t know, I love you, Bet you don’'t know, Bet you don’t know I love you, Bet you don’t love you, Bet you don’t love me, Bet you don’t know, Bet I love you, Bet you don’t love me, Bet you don’t love me, I love you, Bet you don’'t know, Bet you don't know, I love you, I love you, Bet you don't know
Bet you don't know (Never never never never no)
Bet you don't know I love you
Bet you don't know
Bet you don't know I love you
Bet you don't know
Bet you don't know I love you
