I've been thinking of those summer nights
Evenings spent with you in paradise
Never stopped to think how we would feel if
We were parted, brokenhearted
Heaven was right here, right here
Our love never faded with time
heaven was right by your side
Right by your side, right by your side, right by your side, you
Oh, I've been dreaming of those endless days
Laughed aloud at all your crazy ways
Never stopped to think how I would feel if
You were here so close to me, yeah (I was right here)
Right here
Our love never faded with the time, oh
heaven was right where you saw
Right by your side
Right by your side
Heaven was right here, right here in your arms
Our love never faded with time
heaven was right by your side
A love never faded, you are a love never faded, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're a love never faded, you are a love never faded, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay
All our love had faded with the sound of the waves
Heaven was right here
Our love never faded with time
