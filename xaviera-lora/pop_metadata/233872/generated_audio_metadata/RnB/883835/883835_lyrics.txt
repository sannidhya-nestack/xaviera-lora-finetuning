Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
A full moon glows bright after midnight
This party's full blown
The crowd opens up as I dance my way closer to you
Your friends see our eyes lock and try to lay a roadblock
Give you all the gossip start a battle in between your ears
But you can't believe everything you hear
You can't believe everything
That you heard about
So dance with me
Come on
Spinning round the sky
Ain't falling down tonight
Relax, release those heavy thoughts
This magical evening brought you and me here
Your magnetic looks pull me near
Tell me more, I wanna learn everything about you (yeah, you)
Your friends tell the story, make you think that I'm trouble
Well, I wanna burst your bubble and show you the other side
I got nothing to hide (no)
You can't believe everything I know
That you hear, that you see
But you can't believe everything, oh no
That you hear, that you see, dance with me
Relax, release, I only wanna do you right
Spinning round the sky, ain't falling down tonight
Dance with me
My friends say they've got my back
Just steer clear
that girl has been around
That's okay, show me all the places you've been
And I'll take you to a few of my own
Baby, get in my zone
Dance with me
Dance with me
You can't believe everything I know
That you hear, that you see
No, you can't believe everything, oh no
That you hear, that you see, dancing with me
Relax, release, I only wanna do you right
Spinning round the sky, ain't falling down tonight
