Lately everything about you is different now
Moody, keeping to yourself not speaking out
Saying all the nasty things that hurts me baby
When I don't respond you even get more ugly
Sweetie this is too much for me
It's complicated, I don't think we'll make it
I won't say bye bye, I'll just say that I'll see you in a while
Ooh, this is crazy, you told me you hate me
Sorry baby, I have nothing more that I can say
Must you
Keep on arguing and scream and shout
Before you decide to walk away and then ignore me
Baby this is way too far and just too crazy
Can't we go back to where we used to be
Sweetie this is too much for me
It's complicated, don't think we'll make it
I won't say bye bye, I'll just say that I'll see you in a while
Ooh, this is crazy, you told me you hate me
Sorry baby, I have nothing more that I can say
It's complicated, don't think we'll make it
I won't say bye bye, I'll just say that I'll see you in a while
This is crazy, you told me you hate me
Sorry baby, I have nothing more that I can say
