It was a cold December day
When I first laid eyes on you
The air was filled with tension
As we moved around the room
I could feel the fire burning
But my heart wanted to cry
As you walked back out the door
I kept asking myself why
Why do I fall for this feeling
I know my heart well
Constantly got me stayin' in heartbreak hotel
Now I know I can't be with you
Emotions are runnin' high
But I can't fake all this feelin' (can't fake it, can't fake it)
Of attraction in my eyes
I'll just stay to myself
Try to pull myself together
girl I know what's coming
Some more stormy weather, yeah yeah
I can't fight this feeling
I'm not gonna try
'Cause being alone can't be so wrong
Just can't help but to ask myself why
Yeah yeah yeah
Why do I fall for this feeling?
Why do I fall?
I know my heart will go on
It's constantly got me saying the heartbreak
When I can't seem to check out, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm falling far, I know my heart well
I know myself so well
It's constantly got me staying in that heartbreak hotel
Heartbreak hotel
When I can't seem to check out, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's constantly got me stayin' in heartbreak hotel (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
How do I follow this feeling? (yeah)
I know my heart well (whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's constantly got me stayin' in heartbreak hotel
