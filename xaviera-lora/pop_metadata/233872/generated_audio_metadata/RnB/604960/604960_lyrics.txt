Just left the stage with my bandmates
Off to the hotel, packed my things
Flights tomorrow, ooh I can't wait
It's been months since I've seen you
Missed your smile, the way you kiss me
How your gentle hands caress me
Gotta get to you so badly if you only knew
My flight leaves at nine
In these arms you will be surely
Soon you'll be mine
I'll make it worth the wait surely
There'll be no sleep tonight
Anticipating all night
Cause can't wait to arrive
Gonna hold you all summertime
Can't wait to say
Baby it's been so long
I can't wait to hold you
Feel you in my arms
Can't wait to love
Feel your touch
Can't wait to see you babe
Baby you've been too long
Can't wait to hold you
Feel you in my arms
Can't wait to love
Feel your touch
Look at your picture from my wallet
Dying to see you for the longest
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
I can't wait any longer
So supportive with my touring
Have my back and I adore it
I just wanna thank you for it
My desire's getting stronger
Can't wait for the light
The hands of time are moving slow
Eight hours till night
In my bed tossing and turning
I'll be no sleep tonight
Anticipating your night
Just can't wait to arrive
I'm gonna hold you oh so tight
Can't wait to see
I can't wait to hold you (Feel you in my arms)
Can't wait to love (Oh)
Feel your touch
Can't wait to see you baby (Baby it's been too long)
Can't wait to hold you (Feel you in my arms)
Can't wait to love
And feel your terror
Wishing and hoping just won't do
Just wanna wrap my arms around you
Just have to see you
No more sleepless nights
No more wish I might
No more telephones
Because I'm coming home
Want you to feel my sweet embrace
I just wanna see your pretty face
I hope you're ready
I'm gonna give all my loving to you
Wanna give all my loving to you
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't wait to see you
Baby you've been too long
I can't wait to hold you
Can't wait to love
Feel your touch
Can't wait to see you babe
Baby it's been so long
Been waiting to hold you
Feel you in my arms
Can't wait to love
You feel your tongue
Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honeysuckle chocolate chipping kisses for my love for you
Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honeysuckle chocolate chipping kisses for my love for you
