Your warm eyes somehow found me
When I wasn't looking to be found
I needed time to sort things out
And to get my feet back on the ground
The love I had just faded
Leaving me drifted out to sea
Wish I could share those feelings
You give so easily, so free
And you can try to touch me, you can try to love me
Be my sunshine through the rain
So one day I'll start seeing
That you can't stop just being
My angel in vain
When you reached out and touched me
It was so natural for you to do
But how long can you give and give
If I give nothing back to you
I can't tell if you're different
From all those others in the past
Do you have some kind of magic
That you'll convince me will last?
You can try to touch me, you can try to love me
Be my sunshine through the rain
So one day I'll start seeing
You can stop just being my angel in vain
If loss the greatest healer
And if it's me you wanna save
Angel can you stay until I'm able
To give back all you gave?
Well you can try to touch me
You can try to love me
Be my sunshine through the rain
So one day I'll stop seeing
You can stop just being
My angel in vain
Well you can try to touch me
You can try to love me
Be my sunshine through the rain
So one day I'll stop seeing
You can stop just being my angel
My angel in vain
One day I'll be seeing
That you will stop being
My angel in vain
