Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Woke up late
The clock's gone wild
Dreams still stuck
I'm a wandering child
Shoes untied
But the breeze feels right
The sun's my map
I'll chase the light
A day in the sun
Hmm
A day in the sun
Mm, let the worries go
Mm, let's have some fun
Mm
Skipping stones where the river bends
Counting clouds like old time friends
Sunlight on the water as the day takes hold
The rising sun is getting hotter
The air is pure gold
No plans
No strings
Just the sky above
No rush
No need
Just a day to love
A day in the sun
A day in the sun
Let the worries go
Let's have some fun
The world can wait, let it spin its wheel
This heat's the only thing I wanna feel
Catch a laugh, let it echo wide
The sun's my compass, the earth's my ride
A day in the sun, mm
A day in the sun, mm
Let your worries go
Let's have some fun, mm
Golden rays dripping like wine
Bodies glowing, spirits entwined
Time dissolves in the heat of our skin
The days of temple, let the worship begin
Velvet sky, intoxicate me
Every breath tastes like eternity
Lose yourself where the wild hearts run
Drown in the pleasure of a day in the sun
A day in the sun
A day in the sun
Let your worries go
Baby let's have some fun
Let your worries go
Come on love let's have some sweet fun
