You and me with laughter on the breeze
Skipping right between the trees
We find a spark in each new day
And let our troubles drift away
When the clouds threaten to appear
Kindness helps to chase the fear
We hold on tight to how we feel
Every moment here is real
Smiles all around lifting us high
A joyful tune under open sky
When hearts are near hope can be found
Shining so clear with smiles all around
We share our jokes and playful cheer
Never alone, we're glad to be here
The warmth we carry lights the way
Keeping shadows far and grey
Through every twist we carry on
Gentle words keep our spirits strong
We trade our worries for a grin
Growing brighter from within
Smiles all around lifting us high
A joyful tune under open sky
When hearts are near hope can be found
Shining so clear with smiles all around
Even when grey might fill the view
A simple laugh can pull us through
We lean on trust and find our voice
Rising above with fearless poise
Smiles all around, smiles all around
Smiles all around, smiles all around
Now we gently close this song
Carrying joy where it belongs
Smiles all around, singing out strong
Forever alive where we all belong
