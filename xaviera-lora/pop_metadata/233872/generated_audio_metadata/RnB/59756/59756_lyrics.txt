Oh, there is something I wanna tell ya
Been wanna tell ya for a very long time
The way you talk to me
The way you treat me
It makes me wanna lose my mind
There's no more love for you (oh no)
Leave you behind is what I'm gonna do (yeah baby, tell me)
There's no more love for you
There's nothing left for us to do
Oh, no, oh, oh
I'm out of patience, I'm out of here
Time, time, time, time, I'm wasting my time
No more games to play, and it's time said
I want you out of my life (There's no more love for you)
Leave you behind is what I'm gonna do (uh-huh)
There's no more love for you
There's nothing left for us to do
Come on, you're taking it, you're taking it but you never ever giving me
Ever giving me what I need
So it's time for me to go, I get to stepping
I get to stepping so I can breathe
You shake shake but you never take a break
You flip a flop but you don't stop
Putting up with your trouble, tired of taking double
I got nothing but doubt so please count me out
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more
Get up baby, do it
I want you back in my life
There's no more love for you
Baby, my heart is what I'm gonna do
There's no more love for you
There's nothing left for us to do
There's no more love for you
Baby, my heart is what I'm gonna do
There's no more love for you now (no, not anymore)
There's nothing left for us to do (yeah)
There's no more love for you (no, no, no, yeah)
Leaving behind us what we don't know (no, no, no, yeah)
There's no more love for you (I'm only dead)
There's nothing left for us to do (there's no more love for you) (there's no more love for you, yeah)
They got it on this guy, yeah
