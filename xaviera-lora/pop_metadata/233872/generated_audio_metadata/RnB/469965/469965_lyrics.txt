What's a whole lot of money
What's a whole lot of plans
What's a be my Benzo or Bentley
Without you in the chair to take care of me
To take care of me
To take care of me
Listen, I don't know about you but I need my baby by my side
Cause she's the only one that'll cure that loneliness inside
I've been around the world and I know right now all the searching's done
Cause girl you just ain't anyone
I got a lot of cars
I can buy out the bars
But I'd rather spend it all in quality time right where you are
What's a whole lot of money
What's a whole lot of plan
What's a be my Benzo or Bentley
Without you in the chair to take care of me
To take care of me
To take care of me
Girl, now that I need you next to me
Won't you please just come to me
Only you can set me free forever
Now that I need you here with me
Only you can set me free
And girl when you come for me
I'm free forever
I got a lot of cars (I got a lot of cars)
I can buy up the bars (I can buy up the bars)
But I'd rather spend it all in one time right where you are
What's a whole lot of money?
What's a whole lot of plans?
What's it be? My friends or my family?
Without you in the chair to take care of me
To take care of me
To take care of me
