Have you ever found love on a dance floor?
Da da da, da da da, so glad
That I found you
Put on my best
My neck is iced as bling up on my wrist
Where I'mma be is anybody's guess
Every club got my name up on their list
Girl I feel alive
There's something in the air, it's feeling right
It's taking over me and I don't mind
As long as I get another chance tonight
To dance with you
Girl when we dance
I don't know about you, I feel wrong with you (Wrong with you)
It gets deeper to me than just a Tuesday (Just a Tuesday)
Or just moving (Moving)
Truthless music (Truthless music)
Careless love (Careless love)
Girl when we dead, I don't know about you, I feel romance, it gets deeper to me than just a twoset, or just moving, through this music, kill this love
I'm right where I wanna be, girl
I'm right where I wanna be, girl
The next part of you and me, girl
You ain't gotta move from here
Just to redo your hair
Girl, don't you disappear
Girl, I like the way you bounce it up on me
I like the way you move it up on me
I like the way you're holding tight on me
When you look in my eyes
I get so hypnotized
I'm trying to survive
I don't know about you, I feel wronged when
You give people to me, they're just a useless
Or just moving to this music
Girl when we dance (girl when we dance)
I don't know about you I feel romance (romance)
Niggas people tell me they just a-doozin' (doozin')
Or just movin' (movin') through this music
Uh huh, careless love
I see you baby, come on, you see me back in there (yeah)
Big birdie poppin' that (uh-huh), we're playin' hard again
Whatever just come in, do your lil' dance with me
Hey girl, put your hands up, I'm not the Iverson but I'm the answer
I got you runnin' the floor, we gettin' low low
Got you doin' things that you can't do
Girl when we down, huh, I don't know about you, I know you roll with it
It gets deeper to me than just a Tuesday (just a Tuesday)
Or just moving (moving) to this music (to this music)
Girl, it's love (girl, it's love) hey
Girl, when we dance (when we dance)
I don't know about you, I feel romance (romance)
It gets deeper through me than just a Tuesday (a Tuesday)
Before just moving (moving) through this music (this music)
Girl, this love (this love), hey, girl, when we do
I don't know about you, I feel wrong with you
It gets deeper through me than just the two of us, yeah
Or just moving through this music, girl, it's love, yeah
