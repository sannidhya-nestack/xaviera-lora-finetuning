It all began when we were just friends
How could it be wrong?
I've waited so long for you in my life
I wanna taste your lips so sweet
Just like honey
I wanna build a world of love
Made with you
I wanna touch every part of your body
I wanna be the one you wake up to
If you would only let your heart go free
Then maybe we could fall in love
If you would only let your mind be free
We could fall in love
It all began when we were just friends
How could it seem wrong
I've waited so long for you in my life
In my life
I wanna taste your lips so sweet
Just like honey
I wanna build a world of love
Made with you, you
I wanna touch every part
Of your body
I wanna be the one
You wake up to, yeah
If you would only
Even when the day is come and gone and time moves on
I wanna hold you in my heart
I wanna hold you in my heart
I wanna hold ya
And sing you my song
My baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Let your heart go free
Yeah, if you would only
Let your mind be free
baby
Day has come and gone and time moves on
We could be one
We could be one
If you would only
Oh baby
Just maybe
We'd be free, free, free
If you would only
Then maybe
If you would only
Then maybe
If you would only
Then maybe
