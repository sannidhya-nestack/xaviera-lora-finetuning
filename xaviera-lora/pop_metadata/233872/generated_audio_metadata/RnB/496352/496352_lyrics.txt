Without you I just can't be by myself no more
Without you
I just can't think of nothing else
No
I never thought that I could feel this
I can't stand being alone
I walk into my empty room
And this house is not a home
Home
Without you, I don't go out by myself no more
Without you, I'm dreaming of being somewhere else with you
Ever since I met you, honey
I just want you to be mine
I can't stand this empty feeling
That I'm feeling all the time, oh
When I'm without you
Without you
I feel like my life is such a mess, oh, without you
I try but I'm not always at my best, oh, oh
I can't get you off my mind
No matter how hard I try
I can't shake this empty feeling
I gotta have you by my side all the time
I don't wanna be without you
I never thought that I could feel this
I can't stand being alone
I walk into my empty room
And this house is not a home
Without you
With you
Colors come to life
Everything's changed
And you're the one to blame
I just wanna spend the rest of my life with you
And all the things that we can do
honey you know that I love you
Without you
I just can't be by myself no more without you
I just can't think of nothing else
No, I can't get you off my mind
No matter how hard I try
I can't shake this empty feeling
I gotta have you by my side all the time
I don't wanna be without you
I feel like my life's such a mess, oh, without you
I try but I'm not always at my best, no
I never thought that I could feel this
I can't stand being alone
I walk into my empty room and this house is not a home
Without you
