Mmm, cruising down the lane you hear that motor purring
Mr. Toe behind the wheel, adrenaline is stirring
He's got a twist in his grin and a glint in his eyes
Ready to break the rules and catch you by surprise
He's a whirlwind of speed, a dash of wild delight
Once he grips the wheel you know it's out of sight
Funky energy, spinning through the countryside
Step aboard, buckle up for Mr. Toad's ride
Oh, hop on in for Mr. Toad's wild ride
Feel the baseline groove, keep the windows open wide
He's reckless, he's restless, can't keep that spirit tight
Come along and rock out on Mr. Toad's wild ride
He's always searching for the next big thrill
Takes a turn too sharp and climbs another hill
You can hear the frogs croaking and the willow sway
But Toad just laughs, shifts gears and speeds away
His friends try to tame him but he loves to roam
Forever chasing freedom that he calls his own
Flickering street lights and a starry night's guide
No slowing him down on Mr. Toad's ride
Oh, hop on in for Mr. Toad's wild ride
Feel the baseline groove keep the windows open wide
He's reckless, he's restless, can't keep that spirit tight
Come along and rock out on Mr. Toad's wild ride ride
Got a heart so big, full of dreams and schemes
A little bit crazy but bigger than it seems
He might crash and burn but he'll stand back up
Funky soul, unstoppable, always feeling your code
Hop on in for Mr. Toad's wild ride, wild ride
Feel the drumline kick, that electric funk collide (oh, they collide)
He's fearless, he's boundless, excitement magnified
Come along and dance on Mr. Toad's wild ride
