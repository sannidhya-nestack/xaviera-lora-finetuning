From the wound I've been to
Genetically profound
Phenacostic smoke grow
I used to mimic the great not knowing that my talent awaits
Double dated piano and poetry
Then the drums that I noticed made, gave me rhythm
But vocals took up its prison
So I spent some time alone and focused on my lyrical drone
Music and me,'cause I only need it, say
Music and me,'cause I only,'cause I need it, say, say
Music and me,'cause I only need it, say
Music and me
'Cause I won't let it
From the church gospel was birthed
So what's my voice? AM or FM?
What's your choice? Ooh-ooh-ooh
I was into me with gospel and R &B
Soul got a hold of me
Came in style and bond
Jazz was worth my while
I kissed hip hop and he made my heart stop
Ooh yes he did oh so if music can be
'Cause I want it,'cause I need it, music and me
I want it, need it, music and me
Say music and me, I want it
If there's a cure for this
Don't want it, don't need it, et your AI
Black music won't die
Spiritual cries heals us inside
You cannot deny the pain in my voice
Isn't a choice
Chords in my hand you can't understand
Harmonic melodies written just for me
Music and me, music and me, music and me, music and me, music and me, music and me, music and me
Said what would you be without music? (Nothing at all)
Oh, I said what would you be without music? (Nothing at all)
Ooh, said what would you be without music? (Nothing at all)
La-da-da, said what would you be without music? (Nothin', nothin', nothin')
Ooh, nothin' at all, no
Oh, it's the funk in me'cause I don't need that
It's the soul in me'cause I need that
It's the R &B in me, hip-hop, Jay-Z, folk, blues, all of the above
It is me
Music and me, oh, oh, oh
Music and me
