How do you know when it's okay to fall, when it's safe for letting go?
If it's only romance, do you just take the chance? When do you let your feelings show?
And how do you know when it's okay to trust someone who says they care for you?
When they give you their word despite what you've heard
And there's hope you cling into
When you've tried and tried again to be
The woman of his dreams
Can you tell that he won't let you down
As perfect as it seems
How do you know, how do you know
How can you tell when the sight and the smell of him ignites something inside
And what do you do? Think he's feeling it too
But you just want to run and hide
What do you do when you're scared and confused
When you're scared of what you feel?
And he's telling you things that make your heart sing
But you don't know if he's real
When you've been in love and you've had your heart
Torn out and thrown away
How do you know that he is the one
And if he's gonna stay
How do you know? How do you know?
How do you tell if he's good enough
If he deserves to call you his own
I know there's gotta be a warning sign
That's all I wanna know
How do you know
How do you know
How do you know, how do you, how do you, how do you know, how do you know?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
