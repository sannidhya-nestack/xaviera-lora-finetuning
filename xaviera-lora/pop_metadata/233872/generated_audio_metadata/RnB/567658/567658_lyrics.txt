Now here's the story of Roberta and Johnny Lee
Roberta and Johnny Lee
Were traveling north from their home in New Orleans
Roberta wore Johnny's diamond ring
Johnny played the guitar and Roberta just loved to sing
Roberta walked into a bar room
And there sat the man everybody called "Piano Sam"
When Roberta heard the way he played piano
She fell in love with that no-good barrelhouse piano man
Roberta told Johnny Lee she loved piano singing
And Johnny got as mad as mad could be
And that was the night
That ended in the fight
When Piano Sam was shot dead by Johnny Lee
When Johnny Lee walked through the door of that bar room
He was holding his guitar tightly in his hand
That's when they saw Roberta huggin' and kissin'
With that barrel house man they called Piano Sam
Now that's when Johnny Lee pulled out his pistol
And he shot Piano Sam maybe four or five times
And that's the end of my little story
About Roberta P and old Sam and Johnny Lee
Oh, Roberta P and old Sam and Johnny Lee
