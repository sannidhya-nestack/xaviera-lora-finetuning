Let's come together, never wanna say goodbye
Laughing or talking, skies painted in blue
We meet up on the corner, where the street lights shine bright
Our hearts beating rhythm, feeling so brand new
Sharing all our stories, all our dreams tangled in one
Every word we speak, it feels like a lucky charm
We dance like there's no tomorrow, under the midnight sun
Forever young, forever wild
We'll never be lukewarm
Good times, yeah we're living in the moment
Friends by our side, we're unstoppable
Good vibes, nothing's gonna bring us down
Together we'll go to the world, no time to frown
Shall we live in the moment?
We're friends by design
We're unstoppable
Goodbye
Nothing's gonna bring us down
Together we'll conquer the world
One more time today
Yeah, we're living in the moment
Frames by our side
We're unstoppable
Look fast
Nothing's gonna bring us down
Together we'll conquer the world
No time to shroud
Yeah, we're living in the moment, friends by our side
They're unstoppable thoughts, but it's gonna bring us down
Together we'll conquer the world, no time to shine
