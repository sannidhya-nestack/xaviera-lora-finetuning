First time I knew it was love
Was the first time I felt love within
You took my breath away
The first time I felt your breath on my skin
And the sound of your whisper in my ear
Was the first time I needed to hear
That you believed in you and me
Oh, a lifetime of first things play softly on my heart strings
Over and over, a timeless melody
And with a true sense of grace I'll embrace
A lifetime of first dates
There were days and there were nights
Of quiet contemplation
There were moments of joy
And endless months of sweet anticipation
And the first time I heard our little girl cry
Was the first time I felt alive
And I believed in you
Oh, a lifetime of first things plays softly on my heartstrings
Over and over, a timeless melody
And with a true sense of grace I'll embrace
A lifetime of first things
Magical, mystical
It's physical and full of miracles
Oh, a lifetime of first things plays softly on my heartstreams
Over and over, a timeless melody
And with a true sense of grace I'll embrace
A lifetime of first things
Ah, ooh, first things, ooh, ooh, ah, ooh, lifetime of first things, ooh, no, ooh
