Every night before I sleep
I think of the day
And what you meant to me
We had a love so deep within our souls
And now it's gone away
There are so many things I miss
Do you remember this?
My love
We held hands and dined by candlelight
And danced all night, yeah
No matter what you do, I'll always think of you
Forever love
No matter where you are, you'll be my shining star
Forever love
I love the things we used to share
Do you remember when love was there?
Taking long walks in the park
Trying hard to beat the dark
But love got in the way, oh yeah
We were so high, we touched the sky
Reaching for the stars
We knew that love was ours
Every night I dreamed of you
And now you're going away
No matter what you do
I'll always think of you
Forever love
No matter where you are
You'll be my shining star
Forever love
No matter what you do
I'll always think of you
Forever love, no matter where you are
You'll be my shining star
Forever love, it's hard to live without you
I just don't know what to do
Just remember me like I remember you
Wherever you are, I won't be far
Girl remember that I still love you
No matter what you do, I'll always think of you
Forever love
No matter where you are
You'll be my shining star
Forever love
Do you remember the things we used to share
Walking in the park trying to beat the dark
Candlelight, a moment just for two
Me and you, so much in love
Well, I'll always think of you
Forever love
Do you remember?
No matter where you are
Do you remember?
You'll be my shining star
Me and you
