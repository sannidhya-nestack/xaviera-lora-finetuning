Robby Anthem (Robby Anthem)
Hold up, hold up
Yo, you ain't call me back
Hold up, hold up
Baby girl, oh yeah
Hold up, hold up
Baby girl, yeah I know
Hold up, hold up
I'm sure you had your reasons
To leave us behind but now it's over
You were the moon the stars in my sky
So when you looking up there make sure you think of me
And I know you're scared but honestly
Can't you tell by the way they stare wrong
Put your guard down with your hair up
If I kiss you would you kiss back
Do what other dudes hate to mismatch
Talk to me baby I'm the dispatch
You better circle all those things you want
Is that the magazine?
you flaunt how you walk, how you talk
And I know some bitches naive, sayin' whatever to this
Whatever to their needs, got no common sense
No sense from the street, only learned from a man in the sheets
And now that man is gone
So you're here to say hello
This fancy restaurant's a overrated young fellow
A wise man show me be about your company
Not the dough, it's the positive result
From the hard work that he provoked
Take a step back down, deep down you know
That you get what you first put in
And life has no luck
But we all float in with the temptation
My motion of the ocean turn a patient bitch anxious
It's over, hi girl
And I know you had your reasons, without you my heart is cold, it's freezin'
And I know some bitches who you wouldn't refer to as bitches
But I can't fight the itch and I got it now
They want to dig down
They know it's my town
Gonna be the one she miss now
Yeah she frown but we switching gears upside down
Bet you hear cause I'm giving the queen her crown
I say it loud and proud, we live with no letdowns, we live with no regrets now
I thought I told you I'm the prince of palace and malice runs through me
So I am malicious, far from ordinary but believe in the origin
I be ducking hoes like I'm balling at Oregon
Blazing trails, bachelors, far from valid but it's all where you end
But look at this world we exploring and just feel me out, hear me out
I show you what I'm about
Hold up, hold up, it's time to really hide, girl and we could really do this for hide, girl let's start
It's time to really hide, girl and we could really do this for hide
And I know you had your reasons, without you my heart is cold, it's freezin'
It's time to really treat my love as so, it's time to really hide, girl and we could really do this for hide
I remember us then, way back when
Yeah, yeah, I remember us then
And I know you had your reasons, your reasons, yeah
