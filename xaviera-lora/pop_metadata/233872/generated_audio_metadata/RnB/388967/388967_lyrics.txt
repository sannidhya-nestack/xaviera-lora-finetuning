Don't waste my time
Tell me what you wanna do
It's not a crime
Come and show me what a freak can do
If you want it
I'll put it on the plate for you
Get right up on it
Let your fingers talk
I wanna feel them walk
Come and play
My highway
Come and play my way
We can play
All day
All day all day
But you're playing
Me next to mine
But you're playing me next to mine
We can play
We can grind
Come and play my highway
Come and play my way
We can play all day
But you're burning extra money
