Come out and see the sky
Come see summer through my eyes
Hearing a different drum
Summer songs and I can hear summer drums
Listen at the stadium
Laughter
Baseball, summer fun, floating in the August air
Summer clouds, you were there
Summer drums, you are the one I remember
Learning how to move at the summer dance
You taught me how to love forever
Summer love
Summer tunes
Summer drums
Listen at the stadium
Laughter
And these four summer fun were floating in the August air
Summer clouds, you were there, summer drums, oh
You are the one I remember
Learning how to move at the summer dance
And you taught me how to love forever
Summer love, summer tunes, summer drums
Listen at the stadium
Laughter, baseball, summer fun
We're floating in the August air
Summer clouds, you were there
Summer drums
Come on and see the sky
Come see the summer through my eyes
And we're here in a bit of a different dream
Summer, summer drums, feel the beat
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Somebody knows that we're in it
Somebody knows
