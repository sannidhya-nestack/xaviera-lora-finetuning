Colors that go get wild, spin around and smile
Multans just dreams and stars, we'll dance beneath the scars
The love heart and feel deep
In the silence we'll leap
Cut loose love heart
We're bound by hearts
Chase the sun, race the night
Hold on with all our might
Close eyes breathing
Feel the rush on our skin
A love heart feel deep in the silence where we
Could lose love heart we're bound by hearts
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Chase the sun, race the night
Hold on with all our might
Close eyes, breathe in
Feel the rush on our skin
The love heart feel deep
In the silence we'll leave
Cut loose love heart
We're bound by hearts
