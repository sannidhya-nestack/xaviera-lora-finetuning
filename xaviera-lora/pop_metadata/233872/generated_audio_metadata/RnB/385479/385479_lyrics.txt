Where am I, I'm on my own, I've no one here with me
Where am I, I'm on my own, won't you please help me
You were my guide, the one who showed me the way
I have no help, I need help
Can't carry on another day
Not to close the door for a new one
Need to erase what has just been done
Life's too short, one day it will end
What do I do now and where do I go?
I can't find my way out
Where do I go now and what do I do?
Please show me the way out
I never thought it would end this way
Never thought it would all go wrong (all go wrong)
Life has been planned for me, oh yeah
Everything is meant to be
Gotta find that feeling of hope
But all I'm feeling's that I can't cope
Need the sun to be on my way
What do I do now and where do I go
I can't find my way out
Where do I go now and what do I do?
Please show me the way out
Searching around now but where do I go now?
Just can't find my way out
Looking around now
But what do I do now?
Please show me the way out
When I, I'm on my own
I've no one here with me
What do I do now and where do I go?
I can't find my way out
Where do I go now and what do I do?
Please show me the way out
Searching around now
But where do I go now?
Just can't find my
Looking around now, but what do I do now?
Please show me the way out
Where am I? I'm on my own
I've no one here with me
I've no one here with me
