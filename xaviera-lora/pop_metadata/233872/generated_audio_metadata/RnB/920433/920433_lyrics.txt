What are you supposed to do when you've tried to make it through?
What are you supposed to say
When words get in the way
It's over your head
It's out of your hands
There's nothing you can do about it
You're trying to see
You're trying to stand
We fall down
It happens to the best of us
But you gotta keep on moving
Look around
This pain is on the rest of us
So you gotta keep on loving
This is your time, babe
You gotta see it through
If you wait until it's too late
There'll be nothing you can do
Everyone cries, everyone hurts
It's the nature of the universe
There's no better time
We fall down
It happens to the best of us
You gotta keep on moving
Look around
This pain is on the rest of us
So you gotta keep on loving
Why can't you see
It's gonna be alright
There's no doubt in my mind
You're gonna find
We fall down
It happens to the best of us
But you gotta keep on moving
Look around
This pain is on the rest of us
So you gotta keep on loving
We fall down
It happens to the best of us
But you gotta keep on moving
Look around, this pain is on the rest of us
You gotta keep on loving, mmm, ooh, yeah, ooh
Gotta keep on loving, ooh
