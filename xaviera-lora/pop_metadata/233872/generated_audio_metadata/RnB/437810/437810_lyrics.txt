(audience laughing)
Ooh, I wonder what it is that you do to me
And ooh, I wonder what makes me feel this way
Could it be the way you look at me when you speak your mind?
Could it be, the way you undress me in this dream of mine?
Stop haunting me, stop teasing me
Stop playing and make it real
Stop haunting me, stop fooling me
Ooh, I wonder what makes me want you all the time
And ooh, I wonder what gives me chills up and down my spine
Could it be the way you talk to me respectfully and polite?
Could it be, the way your lips invite me to taste your love all at night?
Stop haunting me, stop teasing me
Stop playing and make it real
Stop haunting me, stop fooling me
Stop playin' and make it real
Stop playin' and make it real
Stop playin' and make it real
Could it be, the way you talk to me respectfully and polite
Could it be the way your lips invite me to taste your love all this night?
Stop haunting me, stop teasing me
Stop playing and make it real
Stop haunting me
Stop fooling me
Stop playing and make it real
Stop haunting me
Stop teasing me
Stop playing and make it real
Stop haunting me
Stop fooling me
Can't be healed
Stop blaming you
