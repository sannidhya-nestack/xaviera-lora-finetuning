I feel just like a fool when you make me
I promise that we both know it's a lie
But honey baby you don't have to worry (you don't have to worry no more)
I've been here much too long for me to fly
And even if I did it wouldn't matter (it wouldn't matter)
'Cause ain't no other place I'd stand to be
I'm caught up in the madness that you weave so well
A victim of the love you give to me
It's the magic in your eyes
When we kiss it seems we shoot up to the skies
And I et about the heartache and the lies
I'm hypnotized by the magic in your eyes
To need you like I do must be a hard crime
A twisted rule inside this game we play
'Cause every time you tell me that
You need me baby, need me baby
I can't believe I see the word you say
Oh girl, I never thought that I could love you, oh no
So much until it sometimes makes me cry
My people always tell me that I've lost control
But they can't understand the reasons why
I need you baby (I need you baby)
Don't you know that I need you baby (I need you baby)
Can't tell that I need you baby (I need you baby)
Don't you know that I want you baby (I need you baby)
Don't you know that I'm lovin' you baby (I need you baby)
Don't you know that I'm lovin' you baby (I need you baby)
Don't you know that I need you baby (I need you baby)
Don't you know that I need you baby (I need you baby)
But all I ever seem to do is wait around
there ain't nothing else that I can do (I'm ready to go)
When we kiss, we shoot up to the sky (When we kiss, we shoot up to the sky)
I feel just like a fool when you make me
I promise that we both know it's a lie
But honey baby you don't have to worry (you don't have to worry no more)
I've been here much too long for me to fly
A girl who never thought that I could love you, oh no
So much until it sometimes makes me cry
My fate would always tell me that I've lost control
But they can't understand the reasons why
There's no magic in your eyes
