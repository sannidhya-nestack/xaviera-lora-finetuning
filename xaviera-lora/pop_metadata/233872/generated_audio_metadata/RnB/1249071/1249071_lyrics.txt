Did you ever have a wish
For a girl who could inspire
A ten thousand year year stitch
Of hell of hot desire
Well let me introduce you please
To a girl who fit the bill
I think she took the little red pill
She's a sight to see, less money, a smile worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She struts in her high-heeled shoes, life's starting better, she got everything to lose
Now she's so fly
You have to get an airplane seat
At what cost, lost a pretty penny
Let me come and get some
Would you like a little treat?
Turning heads everywhere, trust me
There are very, very many
She's a little more than 50 rich
One tough bitch, welcome to the sheet
That's all, miss money
You're one sexy sweet honey
Is it fame that you adore, miss money?
Now you got a little, would you like a little more?
Miss money, sweet little honey
I can see that you are vexed
Take a minute, check your mobile
Tell me if you got my text
Flexible finesse and I can see that you've been missing with some things
I think you keep that you've never seen before
She's got a wallet that is tight like a little fatty
Generous, she's very, very, very catty
Buying up the love is something that she can't ever seem to get enough of
Of a swipe of a card, like to play the part
Crashing it very hard in the market for a heart
Oh, Miss Money, you're a fantasy
I think about you every day
I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person to a person in your life
Maybe your girlfriend, maybe your wife
Miss Money, oh, she's so dumb and buys love
But it's never ever chump with a twinkle of greed in her eye
She's a fiscal fairy, fluttering by
She's got a stockpile of sweet admirers
They're all just the instincts that are fueling her desire
She trades her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment, not selling just to pop it
Her laughter rings like a cash register chime
But love's a currency she can't seem to mine
A portfolio of hearts, a lump of portfolio
But the dividends of love she'll never really know
Miss Molly, oh, oh
You know she's a new boss with ease
But her assets are cold, they'll never freeze
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh, how she'll spend seas
She's a penny pitcher with a golden touch
But the cost of love, it seems too much
Miss Maudet, oh
The irony's not lost
Can't budge if the love, it's an endless cost
Now she's bankrupt in the market of hearts
A fiscal failure torn apart
But oh, Miss Money, you're still a sight
In the cold hard cash of the night
Oh, Miss Money, you're a fantasy
I think about you every day
I wonder if you will ever be
As significant of a person to a person in your life
So here's to this money, the bell, the ball, may your asses she liquid
