Hey Bobby, it's your birthday
Let's go out and play
Let's et about what happened
In the past five days
Bobby come here and take my hand
Take my hand
Together we'll walk along in the sand
I don't know where we'll go but
The sun will feel good on your face
What a lovely place to be here with you (with you)
And me (and me)
Just us two
That's my present to you
There's nothing like taking
A walk in the park
I know you need some rest
From this weary heart of yours
And I've got the answer
To what's troubling you
Come on, look me straight in the eyes and do this
You won't regret it
Bobby, come here and take my hand
Oh, together we will
Together we'll walk along in the sand
I don't know where we'll go but
The sun will feel good on your face (so good)
What a lovely place to be here with you (with you)
And me (and me) just us two
That's my present to you
That girl wasn't nothing
To get caught up in
To think you had a future
That girl wasn't nothing
she didn't realize
Just what she had in you
As far as I'm concerned
You got so much more going on
You're one of a kind
And any girl would be lucky to have you
Bobby come here and take my hand
Take my hand and together we'll
Together we'll walk along in the sand
I don't know where we'll go but
The sun will feel good on your face
What a lovely place to be here with you
And me (and me) just us two
That's my present to you
I don't know why I've got my heart on the line for you
I think I know why I try so hard to help you get over her
Something inside me tells me it's not just for you
It's for me to see if I can get you to realize
Bobby, I think I love you
Bobby, come here and take my hand
Take my hand and together we'll walk
Together we'll walk along in the sand
I don't know where we'll go but
This oughta feel good on your face
What a lovely place to be here with you
And me, just us two
That's my present to you
