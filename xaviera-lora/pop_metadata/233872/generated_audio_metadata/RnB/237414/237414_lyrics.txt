Love believes on things, bears on things, hopes and endures all things
Love will never fail, it will never cease
Have my love and I am nothing
I never knew that I had nothing'til I met you
I was missing something special
That thing that I needed I found in you
Ooh, I was bitter, you were sweet, you saw the best in me
Saved me from my vanity by showing me a new reality
Nobody will ever make me feel like you do (never you)
Love could make me feel so, it was you
Ooh, made me feel so
There are no words to describe what you do to me
Yeah, love brought the best out of me, pretty baby
I never knew love could make me feel so
It was you who made me feel so
There are no words to describe what you do to me
Yeah, love brought the best out of me, pretty baby
I never met someone who made me feel the way you do
You opened up my eyes and showed me something new
Oh, I wanna spend the rest of my life with you
And I can't believe that you could have this effect on me
I'm hoping that I make you see just how much I wanna be the one
I love you, love can make me feel so, so, so, so, so, so, love can make me feel so
There are no words to describe what you mean to me, love, you're the best I've ever been, baby
Love can make me lose it (You know I never knew)
It was you (I never knew)
I made it, it was you (I made it)
You're not worth to describe what you do to me (I don't know who you are)
And the love brought the best out of me, pretty baby
You gave purpose to a life full of meaning
It feels like a new beginning
It's a chance to start anew
There's so much I want to share with you
I never knew love could make me feel so in this new world
It was you who taught me what I was to describe what you do to me
Your love wrote the best out of me, baby (I'm living in a lie, I'm living in a lie, I'm living in the lie, I'm living in a lie)
There could be you, there are no words to describe what you do to me (Your love wrote the best out of me, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Your love wrote the best out of me), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (I'm living in a lie), (
And I love when I am nothing
