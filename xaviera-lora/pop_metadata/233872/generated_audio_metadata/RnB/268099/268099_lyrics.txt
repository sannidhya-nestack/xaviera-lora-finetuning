Yeah, yeah, yeah
The perfect weather
Got so much road ahead of me
A sunny day and I'm on my way
Can't wait to get to my baby
Get to my baby
If he only knew
How much I do
To be with him right now
How many roads I take (How many roads I take)
How many steps I make (How many steps I make)
Just to be with Him (Just to be with Him)
By the time the sun goes down
There'll be no one else around
Except me and my baby
Me and my baby, yeah yeah
Lots of miles ahead of me
But in the end it's gonna be
Just me and my baby
Perfect timing
And no more miles between us now
I made it here and it's very clear
That we're about to make the town
If only, if only
These miles weren't in the way
Then maybe, oh baby (oh baby, yeah)
We could do this every day (every day, every day, yeah)
By the time the sun goes down
There'll be nowhere left to go from my baby (I can't wait until my baby, my baby, my baby, yeah)
Lots of miles ahead of me
But in the end it's gonna be just me and my baby (my baby, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
By the time the sun goes down (oh yeah) there'll be no one else around (no one else around, yeah)
But don't mess with me and my baby (Lots of miles ahead of me)
So open up (But in the end it's gonna be just me and my baby)
Me and my, me and my baby baby
By the time the sun goes down
There'll be no one else around since me and my baby
But in the end it's gonna be just me and my baby (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Me and my baby
Don't you mess with me (by the time the sun goes down)
Baby, we know (I'm on my way)
I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
I'm on my way, wanna stay
Lots of miles ahead of me
But in the end it's gonna be just me and my baby
My baby, I'm coming, coming home to you
By the time the sun goes down
There'll be no one else around
Except me and my baby
Lots of miles ahead of me
But in the end it's gonna be
Just me and my baby
By the time the sun goes down
There'll be no one else around
Except me and my baby
Lots of miles ahead of me
But in the end it's gonna be
Just me and my baby
By the time the sun goes down
