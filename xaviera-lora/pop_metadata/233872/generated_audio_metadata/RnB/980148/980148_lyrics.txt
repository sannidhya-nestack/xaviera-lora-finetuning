You know I should apologize
Smiles don't smile no more
The vibe don't vibe no more
The vibe don't vibe no more
See the truth is
Ain't no truth see, ain't never been no truth
At least not for you and me
But I see, I understand
You wanna believe in something
And see they know that
So they build a facade, a great wall of nothing
And as long as it's something you can figuratively touch and feel
And you walk away content that what they gave you was real
But check back, they owe you back checks for more than 400 years
Of us building this place we call America off our blood, sweat and tears (No one should apologize)
(Smiles don't smile no more)
The vibe don't vibe no more
The vibe don't vibe no more
My grandfather, my great grandfather
Plus my great great and my great great great
I'd even go for my grandmother and my great grandmother
And my great great plus the late great
Leaders caught up in the Jim Crow law times, civil rights raw times
Back then you look a white man in the face it was basically war time
They claim they believers but believers ain't that evil are they?
Shackled us up for four centuries and set us free but still our bodies
Are locked away, pipelined to prison, the new Jim Crow
Look at us, we don't smile no more
Thought you should know
No one should apologize
Smiles don't smile no more
The vibe don't vibe no more
The vibe don't vibe no more
The slave minded don't even know they're free
