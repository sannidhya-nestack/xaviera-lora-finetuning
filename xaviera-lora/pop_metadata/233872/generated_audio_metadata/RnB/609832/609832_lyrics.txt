Baby I'm not trying to win your heart
But I don't want you to be the fool
Girl you better stop this thing before it starts
Cause what he's planning to do ain't cool
You can't believe everything that you hear
Objects in the mirror smaller than they appear
You better open up your eyes and ears
'Cause when you need him, girl, they'll disappear
But the love that we need, you're the same old line
Betcha he says that
But all I do is break your heart down every time
To all the girls
So you realize he's the plain kind
Betcha he says that
And I'm coming right back into these arms of mine
To all the girls
Girl, I saw him walking down the street last night
With another girl by his side
Judging from the touchy feeling things they did
You were the last thing on his mind
You should've heard the things he said to her
Things that I know he says to all the girls
Why would you want to be in his world
When you know you'll run off with some other girl
But he loves you, he needs you the same old way
Baby he loves you, baby he needs you
But all you do is make it hard time after time
You all love your ass, so you realize it's a plain kind
Betcha he's the real life (He's the one, he's coming in like a dream)
(So I'ma find you all the girls)
I'm giving you all the advice I can
But still you choose to be with him
In games like this you never win
You need to find yourself another man
He said you were his only girl
He promised he'd give you the world
What can I do to convince you girl?
He said that to all the girls
That's right!
What? Yeah! That's right!
Bet you he says that all you do is break your heart time after time to all the girls
So you realize he's the plain kind
Bet you he says that all you do is break your heart time after time to all the girls
Bet you he says that all you do is break your heart time after time to all the girls
Betcha he's gonna read your lines (say it, say it)
Come on back into these arms and bind you all the girls
Bet he loves you, he needs you the same old night (baby, he loves you)
Betcha he says that (baby, he needs you)
All we do is spend our hard times and times with all the girls (betcha he says that to all the girls)
So he realizes that playing is kind
Betcha he's gonna read your lines (say it, say it)
Come on back into these arms and bind you all the girls
