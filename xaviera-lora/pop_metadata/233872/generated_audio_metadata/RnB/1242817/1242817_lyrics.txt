Start groovin' to the beat, groovin' to the rhythm
Feelin' so alive, ain't nobody gon' stop us
Body's in motion, the floor is our kingdom
No need for words, just let the music talk for us
Jumpin' up and down
Feeling the vibration, everyone around
Joining in the skyline vibration like a tornado
Causing a commotion
Lose ourselves in moment, pure devotion
Dancing, dancing, feeling so free
In this crazy world, it's where I wanna be
Moving to the beat, moving to the rhythm
Feeling so alive, ain't nobody gonna stop us
Body's in motion, floor is our kingdom
No need for words, just let the music toss us
For us, for us
Jumping up and down
Feeling vibration
Everyone around
Joining in the celebration
Feeling like a tornado
Causing a commotion
Lose ourselves in moment
Pure devotion
Dancing, dancing
Feeling so free
In this crazy world
It's where I wanna be
That's it, dancing free
In this crazy world, it's where I wanna be
