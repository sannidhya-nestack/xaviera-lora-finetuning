Sweet, na-na-na-na-na-na
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to blame you
But after review
I know it's not your fault
It wasn't you
That left all these wounds
Like I at first had the whole
It's kinda confusing
But it's been proven
Living without love won't do
Though I have felt pain
It's hard to explain
My beef with him or you
Took some time to clear my mind
Love's not my enemy
It's a remedy
I had it wrong for so long
love don't play dirty
Love never hurt me
No, you never hurt me
Just think about it
You'll start to doubt it
Why does love get such a bad rap?
I thought love betrayed me
I thought love had played me
Gave up on it and got depressed
Anger misdirected, love itself was not the culprit
I stopped blaming it for my pain
After my berating, I started contemplating
The beauty of your love
Yeah, I took some time, cleared my mind
Love's not my enemy, it's only my thing
I had it wrong for so long'cause love don't play dirty (love don't) love never hurt me (no, no)
Took some time, cleared my mind, love's not my enemy (it's not the enemy) it's a remedy (yeah, it's a remedy, yeah)
I had it wrong for so long'cause love don't play dirty (love don't) love never hurt me (no, you never hurt me)
Sweet, la-de-da-de-da, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Sweet, la-de-da-de-Da
Yeah, I love love (I start blaming love for his mistakes)
Yeah, I love love (I start staying mad and being a wreck)
Yeah, I love love (I start walking'round claiming that I don't need it)
Yeah, I love love ('Cause everybody already knew that I didn't mean it)
So sometimes when my mind loves not my enemy (oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
It's the remedy (oh yeah, hey)
I had it wrong for so long'cause love's a good thing (oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
They'll never hurt me (oh yeah, hey)
It took some time to clear my mind (now that you love me, it's so romantic)
I had her on for so long,'cause (the perfect timing)
Love never hurt me (na-na-na-na-na)
Love never hurt me
