The ruckus of unending circles
In a maze you put me through
It's got me yellow, green and purple
Got me black and blue but that's what it takes to be in love
Broken backs and heartaches is what it is and what it does
It was such a fool to love you, such a fool to love you
Such a fool to have you lying in my bed
I was such a fool to love you
I was such a fool to love you
I was such a fool to have you lying in my bed
See every spring as life starts blooming And the past is yet replaced
The moving world just keeps on moving As I stand in place but that's what it takes to be in love
It's a tax, no one can pay
No one can say they've got enough
I was such a fool to love you
I was such a fool to love you
I was such a fool to have you lying in my bed
You were such a fool to love you (such a fool to love you)
Such a fool to love you (such a fool to have you)
Lying in my bed to hug you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You got me figured out and you're pulling on my strings
You got me screaming like "Ahh !"
And now I figured out there's something wrong with me
I don't wanna be right
I was such a fool to love you (I was such a fool to love you)
Such a fool to love you (I was such a fool to love you)
Such a fool to have you lying in my bed
Such a fool to love you, such a fool to love you
Such a fool to have you lying in my bed
But if it was wrong, well I don't wanna be wrong
If I was wrong, well, I don't wanna be right (Such a bitch, such a bitch, such a bitch, such a bitch)
Well, I don't wanna be right (Such, such a bitch, such a bitch, such)
If I was wrong, well, I don't wanna be right
And I don't wanna be right
But if I'm strong, well, I don't wanna be right, right
I don't wanna be right
