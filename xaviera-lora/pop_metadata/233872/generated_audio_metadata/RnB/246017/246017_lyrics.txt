Ooh, yeah, oh, ooh
Ain't gonna waste no time trying to figure out
What causes the rain to fall
Too many reasons to smile in spite of my struggle
This strong will to pass by
No matter which way you look at it
I have been blessed
With favour and the means to live
So now I just wanna say thank you
And give of myself
On you I've come to depend
I can think of a million ways
'Cause you, you mean that much to me
I don't want to give my all to you
You mean that much, mean that much to me
Some may come and go
One thing I know for sure
You always have my best in mind
The essence of a true friend
In spite of my faults
To thank you, where do I begin?
Can't imagine my life without you
I don't know where I'd be
And even when things don't seem to work out right
You're just so good to me
I wanna say
One million ways
More than words can say
More than anybody can say
I love you more than you will ever know
I want to say you know I love you more than words can say
I can find a million ways to say
I can find a million ways
I can think of a million ways to show you're certain you mean that much to me
You mean that much, mean that much to me, yeah
You mean that much to me, yeah
I just wanna say, I wanna tell you that I love you
