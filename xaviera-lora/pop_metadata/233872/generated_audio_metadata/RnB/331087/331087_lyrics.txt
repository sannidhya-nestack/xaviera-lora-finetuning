You wanna know what I've been thinking
Feels so right having you lying next to me
I've been drifting for a long time baby
Here and there, uptown baby everywhere
Going like the wind blows, baby
Never knowing what was gonna come my way
Never knowing what the day would bring
Here you are, now that changes everything
And I'm saying it was fun
I'm saying you're the one
So how about forever
You and me a long, long time
I've been going like the wind blows, baby
Never knowing what was gonna come my way
Never knowing what the day would bring
Here you are, now that changes everything
And I'm saying it was fun (I'm saying it was fun)
I'm saying you're the one (you're the only one)
So how about forever, you and me a long, long time?
I'll leave those days behind me (yes I do, oh yes I do)
And never will look back at all
And I'm sayin' it was fun (it was fun)
I'm sayin' you're the one (sayin' you're the only one)
So how about forever? You and me alone, all time?
And I'm sayin' it was fun (it was fun)
I'm sayin' you're the one (sayin' you're the only one)
So how about forever? You and me a long, long time (you and me)
And I'm saying you're the one, still the one
I'm saying you're the one
So how about forever
You and me alone, on time
