Well, I've been down, been so blue
Ever since you left me, I can't get over losing you
Don't believe it's true
No matter how I try, I just can't believe we're really through
I'd do my time, hit the ground
And everything I try to do reminds me that you are not around
Nowhere to be found
Well, I gotta get to you somehow
my world is turning upside down
Come back to me, baby, come back to me
I just can't shake this feeling that's hanging over me
I done you wrong now, that much is true
But I need your here beside me
And I'm still in love with you, oh baby, please
Baby, come back to me
I believe I've seen the light now and the error of my ways
I've cried so many nights now and my life is just a haze
Well I'm much too full of pride now to get down on my knees
But I love you so much darling and I'm asking you please (asking you please)
Oh, come back to me baby, come back to me
I just can't take this feeling that's hanging over me
I done you wrong now
That much is true
But I need you here beside me
Yes, I'm still in love with you
Oh baby please
Baby come back to me
Oh baby please
Hey, hey, come back to me baby, hey, hey
Come back to me baby, hey, hey
Can't shake this feeling baby, oh yeah
Come back to me baby (Come back to me, come back to me, come back to me, come back to me, come back to me baby)
Come back to me baby (oh)
Come back to me baby (hey, hey, hey)
I done you wrong, come back to me, oh, oh, oh, oh (back to me, baby, hey, hey, hey, ooh)
Hey, hey (come back to me, baby, hey, hey, hey)
