I will lose my soul
I will lose my mind
I will lose it all
You know that
You make me fighter
You make me stronger
I'm getting louder
All over
I made it
I made it, oh I made it
Through the pain I gained my faith you make me wise men
Through the storm I gained my strength you make me stronger men
We dance for your holiness
Holiness, yeah
Through the darkness you my light
You make me find a way (you show me the way)
Through the darkness you my hope
Oh, I made it
I made it
I made it, oh I made it
Now I stand here with a light
A testament to your great might
And I know that I can face it all
With you by my side
I will never never fall
I will keep on walking in the light
With the one who make me who I am
I will never never et that day
You are my strength, you my power, I made it
I made it (I made it) oh I made it (I made it) oh (I made it) oh (I made it, I made it, I made it)
Through the pain I get my (I made it) through the storm I get my (I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it
I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it
