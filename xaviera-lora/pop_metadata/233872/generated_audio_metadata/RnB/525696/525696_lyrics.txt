I found love, baby
When I looked into your eyes
I found love, yeah, when I guess it's no surprise
I found love when you said hello to me
To me girl I don't know what to do
Since I found love in you
I found love
Faking love through the night
Kiss you girl, squeeze me tight
I knew this moment would be right
Please don't stop'til morning light
I found love in you
I found love
I found love when I held you in my arms
I found love when you teased me with your charms
I found love
This time I know it's real
Girl it's real
I don't know what to do
Since I found love in you
I found love
Making love through the night
Kiss you girl squeeze me tight
I knew this moment would be right
Please don't stop the morning light
'Cause I found love in you
I found love
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Ooooh, ooooh)
(Ooooh, ooooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Girl, it's real, I don't know what to do
Since I found love in you
I found love
Faking love through the night
Squeeze me tight
I knew this moment would be right
Please don't stop the morning light
I found love in you
I found love
Girls, I love you so (I love you, say big love through the night)
Kiss you, girls, please be tight (I found love, I found love, it could be right)
Please don't stop the moonlight (I love you, say big love through the night)
Kiss you, girls, please be tight (I found love, I found love, it could be right)
Ooh, I love you, say big love through the night
I love you, baby, love you through the night
