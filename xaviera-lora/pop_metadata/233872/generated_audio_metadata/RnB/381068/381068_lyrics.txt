To supply your every need
And I just wanna satisfy you

To have your love be constantly (mmm)

I dream about you, lying in my bed, yeah
Don't wanna live without you,'cause I'm happy with you instead
If you promise to love me, and never break my heart
Then I will never hurt you, or tear our love apart
I love what you do to me, love is like a fantasy, hold me now
Just hold me now
