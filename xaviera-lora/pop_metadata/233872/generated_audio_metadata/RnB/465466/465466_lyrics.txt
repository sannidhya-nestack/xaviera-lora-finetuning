Your magic touch is what it is
Your magic touch means so much to me
you've captured my heart unintentionally
Yeah, you've captured my heart
And I need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya
Yes I need ya, need ya, need ya
Please be kind
All my loving's just for you
So please be gentle, don't tear my heart in two
your sweet, sweet humming's blowing me
Yeah, your sweet, sweet humming's blowing me
And I need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya
And I need you, need you, need you
Please be kind
Your magic touch is what it is
Your magic touch means so much to me
you've captured my heart unintentionally
you've captured my heart
