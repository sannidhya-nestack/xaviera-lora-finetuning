You got the touch that I can't live without
Love's taking over and I need you now
Never knew love could feel so good
Your lips are on my mind girl
Would do anything to be close to you
Anticipating what we're gonna do
I'm so glad that you're mine baby
Your lips are on my mind girl
I find myself daydreaming about you
'Cause girl you got the kisses that make me fall, yeah babe
And every little thing that I do, yeah it's for you
But nothing comes fast, don't wait, we're alone
The touch that I can't live without
Was taken over and I need you now
Never knew love could feel so good
Your lips are on my mind, girl
Do anything to be close to you
Anticipating what we gonna do
I'm so glad that you're mine baby
Your lips are on my mind girl
Anticipating what we gonna do
When I met you in these arms, oh baby
It all started from the moment I met you
And you put your lips on mine
Ooh, you stole my heart, babe
Got the touch that I can't live without (you, girl)
It's taking over and I need you (ooh, baby)
Never knew love could feel so good (ooh)
Your lips are on my mind
Girl, would you do anything to be close to you?
Anticipating when we gonna do it all?
I'm so glad that you're mine, baby
Your lips are on my mind, girl
See girl, your lips are on my mind
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Girl, you know, baby
All the touch that I can't live without
Was taken over and I need you now
Never knew love could feel so good
Your lips are on my mind, girl
Do anything to be close to you
Anticipating what we gonna do
I'm so glad that you're mine, baby
Your lips are on my mind, girl
You're on my mind, yeah
You're on my mind, girl
Ooh, baby
