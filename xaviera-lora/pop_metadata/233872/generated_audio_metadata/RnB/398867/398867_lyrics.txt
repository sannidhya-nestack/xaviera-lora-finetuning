Found myself in a strange bed
In a strange room kinda laid, yeah
The funny thing is it was my bed
And the room I helped decorate, yeah
So I pulled up the strange sheets
Then my mama brought me five years past, yeah
Lying next to the strange girl
Wasn't sure that we could make it past, yeah
Now I understand what it means when they say
If you let it, it will simply just drift away
When it's hard to remember good old days
Probably let it drift away, babe, hey
Now I understand what it means when they say
You can't get mad and just walk away
if you do, I tell you you'll be sorry one day
Probably let it drift away
Found myself in a strange space
Spending more time all alone
Can't believe I gotta make a call
Just to visit my own home
Used to get mad at my little girl
When she wanna crawl in my bed at night
I'd give anything to hear her cry
Wouldn't even put up a fight, no
Now I understand what it means when they say
If you let it it will simply just drift away
When it's hard to remember
Good old days
Probably let it drift away, babe, mm-hmm
Now I understand what it means when they say
Can't get back just to walk away
if you do, I tell you, you'll be sorry one day
Probably let it drift away, mm-hmm
Never let it drift away, mm-hmm
Now think about the times when you first got together
You swore you'd always be together
Gotta do what it takes so you can always be together
You never let it drift away
Think about the times when you first got together
And you swore you'd always be together
Gotta do what it takes so you can always be together
Now never let it drift away
Think about the times when you first got together and you swore you knew you would always be together
You would always be together, you'd never let it drift away
Now I understand what it means when they say you let it, it was simply just a rift away
When it's hard to remember
Good old days
Probably let it drift away
Now I understand what it means when they say
Can't get mad and just walk away
Cause if you do I tell you you'll be sorry one day
Probably let it drift away
Let it drift away
Now I understand what it means when they say
You probably let it drift away
When it's hard to remember good old days
You probably let it drift away
Now I understand what it means when they say
You can't get mad and just walk away
if you do, I tell you you'll be sorry one day
You probably let it drift away
Now I understand what it means when they say
When it's hard to remember good old days
