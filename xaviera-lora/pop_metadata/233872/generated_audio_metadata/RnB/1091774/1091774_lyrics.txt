Used to be when you'd walk out on me
Yeah, I'd just come apart at the seams
For every time you kissed me
I'd drink a shot of whiskey
I'd cry and cry and cry
Wishing you were with me
But I ain't gonna fall apart this time
No, no, I might lose a little sleep
But I ain't gonna lose my mind
Gonna handle the heartache better
Gonna keep myself together
I ain't gonna fall apart this time
No, not for you, woo
Lately I just go out for a run, yeah baby
And working in the garden's always fun
To keep from getting caught up
In that silly heartbreak, hoo-ah
I hang out with the great
Ongoing cosmic dude, ah
So I ain't gonna fall apart this time
No, no
I might lose a little sleep
But I ain't gonna lose my mind
Gonna handle the heartache better
Gonna keep myself together
I ain't gonna fall apart this time
No, ain't gonna fall, no
I'm gonna stand tall
I ain't going far
