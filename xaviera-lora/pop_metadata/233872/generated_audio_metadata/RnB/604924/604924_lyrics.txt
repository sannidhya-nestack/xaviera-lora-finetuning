Oh girl I love your smile
Saw you from across the room, got up off my seat
Girl I truly fell for you, tripped over my feet
It was instantly, just had to make my move, to step to you
Got my heartbeat escalating, anticipating, just to know your name
So long I waited, it's been a minute since I felt this way
When you smiled it was when I knew I just had to get with you
Girl I love your smile, your smile, ain't nothing else a lie
Your smile, God love your smile (oh yeah)
Your smile, ain't nothing else like (nothing else like)
Your smile (I'm hoping this could be the start of something that could last)
Here we have potential hope I'm not moving too fast
We have chemistry just had to take a chance
To see if our love grows
To the point of no escaping pure elation
There's no turning back
Infatuated, captivated
Girl I want you back
When you smiled it was then I knew
Just had to be with you
Girl I love your smile
Your smile ain't nothing else alive
You're a smile, girl I love your smile
You're a smile, ain't nothing else like
You're a smile, girl I love your smile
You're a smile, ain't nothing else like
You're a smile, girl I love your smile
You're a smile, ain't nothing else like
Your smile I never knew
Your smile can make me feel the way I do
Lights up a room
So keep smiling for me babe
Girl you know I love you
Girl you know I love you
Can't live without you babe
My hour brightens up my day
Oh, girl I love your smile
Your smile, ain't nothing else alike
Your smile, can't help but love your smile
Love your smile, your smile, ain't nothing else alike
Your smile, can't help but love your smile (love your smile, can't help but love your smile)
Your smile, girl I love your smile, your smile, ain't nothing but a smile, your smile
