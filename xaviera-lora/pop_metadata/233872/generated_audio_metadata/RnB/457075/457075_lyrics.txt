This is the day that you will be the greatest thing in our human race
Without question, feeling the tension
But we know times are hard there's no need to mention
Don't worry though, take it slow, get it back on
Don't be prone, just give it in, just give it in
This is no time to be shy
Time to stand up and open your eyes
You are so beautiful
You are so beautiful
Yes you are
Yes you are
You are the best that you can be
Be positive and look up and see
You got soul, you got love, you are free
That's why you're so special to me, to me
You are so beautiful
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
You are the best that you can be
Be positive and look up and see
You are so beautiful
Yes you are
