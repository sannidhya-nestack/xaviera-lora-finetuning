I should've seen the signs
But I was blinded by your smile
I thought you were the one
But now I'm left here in denial
I should've kept my heart in check
I should've known it was a risk
But now I'm left here broken with nothing left but this
How could I not see this coming?
It was too late to prevent this nightmare from happening
I'm sorry I shouldn't have confessed my love to you
Now you're just leaving me lost with hopes and broken dreams
I thought we had something real, I thought we had a chance
But now I see it was all a lie and I'm left here with this circumstance
I should've known better, I should've seen it all along
But now I'm left here hurting
With nothing left but this song
How could I not see this coming
It was too late to prevent this nightmare from happening
I'm sorry I shouldn't have confessed my love to you
Now you're just leaving me lost with hopes and broken dreams
How could I not see this coming?
It was too late to prevent this nightmare from happening
I'm sorry I shouldn't have confessed my love to you
Now you're just leaving me lost with hopes and broken dreams
I'll pick up the pieces
I'll mend my broken heart
All of them to move on
And make a brand new start
How could I not see this coming?
It was too late to prevent this nightmare from happening
I'm sorry I shouldn't have confessed my love to you
Now you're just leaving me lost with hopes and broken dreams
How could I not see this coming?
It was too late to prevent this nightmare from happening
I'm sorry I shouldn't have confessed my love to you
Now you're just leaving me lost with hopes and broken dreams
I'll pick up the pieces
Ooh, I'm in my open heart
Ooh, I'll learn to move on
And make a brand new start
Mmm
