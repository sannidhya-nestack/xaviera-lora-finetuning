Love is just a game that we keep playing
Even when we don't see eye to eye
Listen to the words that love is saying
Nothing in this world can make you cry
Walk along the ocean sand at midnight
Planning how to make your dreams come true
Sharing secrets underneath the moonlight
Wishing for a star to shine on you
Feel the heart around you is in the air
Feel the love, feel the love
Feel it, feel the love around you
It's everywhere
Feel the love, feel the love, love, love, love
Love is like a song that we keep singing
Two can be in harmony as one
The spirit and the strings hear them flowing
Love is just a dream of things to come
There's nothing like it
Don't try to fight it
Let the passion rise in you
The music in the background, it's that sweet soul music
Ooh, baby, let's groove
Feel the love around you, it's here in the air
Feel the love, feel the love
Feel the love around you, it's everywhere
It's in the air, it's everywhere, everywhere
Feel the love around you, it's in the air
Feeling the love around you, it's everywhere
Nothing like it, no, no, feel the love
There's nothing like it
Don't try to fight it
Let the passion rise in you
The music in the background
It's that sweet soul music
Ooh baby let's groove
Feel the love, feel the love
Feel it, feel the love around you
It's everywhere, it's everywhere
It's in the air, can you feel it?
Feel the love around you, feel the love, feel the love
Feel the love, it's everywhere, it's everywhere
