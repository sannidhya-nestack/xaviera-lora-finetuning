Oh, don't tell, don't tell anybody
Ooh, you're the one for me
You're the one in time
I want you more when you know what's up
Others if you give them one, them go one too
If you give them three then go on four
But not only you my heart cares for
You fascinate me
You hypnotize me
You don't realize
How precious you are
I wanna put a ring on it (I wanna put a ring on it)
Get you to stay around, yeah
I see that you're world young and sweet
I see that you're young and sweet
Don't tell nobody
That we're mad and we've touched
Don't tell nobody
That we're mad and we've fell in love
Don't tell nobody
Just can't feel between me and you for now I'm nobody
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Let's leave life heaven-sea (ooh-ooh)
Blend together mac and cheese (ooh-ooh)
I bet mama gon' like this (this)
I like how you got your body up
Smile always for me
You are the best for me
Lock it down and make it clap, clap, clap, clap
Pour your love on me
All of it on me
And then we go like la-la-la-la (don't tell nobody)
That we're mad and we've touched, don't tell nobody (don't tell nobody)
That we're mad and we've fell in love, don't tell nobody (oh, oh, oh)
Just keep it between me and you for now, nobody
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Do you better, do you better, do you better, do you better, do you better, do you better, do you better, do you better, do you better, do you better, do you better, do you better, do you better, do you better, do you better, do you better, do you better, do you better, do you better (It's all see the beat cut Don't tell nobody Stop playing
