You say that you're afraid to let me in
You say you don't know when it's gonna end
Been hearing about all the girls I played
Been hearing about the broken hearts I made
But that was before
Willing to give you my everything, yeah
And we all bet you need a man to be (Uh-uh, baby, no, no) (Yeah) (Uh-uh, no, no)
I ain't going nowhere, nah
I'm gonna show you that I care (Uh-uh, baby, no, no) (Uh-uh, no, no)
Oh baby, I'm gonna show you I care
I will always be there
I guess that you could say I never found
A lover was all good to tie me down
But baby now all of that has changed
My whole life you rearranged
It's not like it before
I'm willing to give you my everything, yeah
And we all bet you need a mess of me, oh baby
I ain't going nowhere
Nah, I will always be there
Uh uh, baby, no no, uh uh, no no
I'm gonna show you I care
Uh, I will always be there
Some people never find
What they're looking for in life
I'm so glad I found the one
The one I'm searching for, I'm waiting for
Baby girl, my love forever
No baby, I ain't going nowhere
Girl, I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna show you, I can't hold you
I will always, always be there, oh baby, I ain't going nowhere, oh no, I'm gonna show you that I care, oh baby, oh baby
I'm gonna show you I care (I ain't going nowhere, I'll show you I care)
I'll always, always be there (uh-uh, baby, no, no, uh-uh, no, no)
I ain't going nowhere (that's right)
Ooh (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Uh-uh, baby, no, no, uh uh, no, no
I'm gonna show you I care (I ain' going nowhere, I'll show you I care)
Baby, baby, I'll always be there
Oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
