Whenever I'm down and feeling so low
She makes it a point to keeping me whole
Whenever I'm down and thinking about you
You're making me high with what we've been through
Loving in me is a daily surprise
To live in my darkness and keep it alright
She was alone waiting and trying to get by
With love and the romance to grow what's inside
What you bring to me
Lovin' in home, makin' it right, you in my mind
Oh, what you bring to me
You're lovin' on time, makin' it right, then everything's fine
Oh, since that night, she never looked back
She wasn't inclined to cry by design
With living in me
Livin' in a youth
So I would roam
So she could be free
But she would never leave it
I couldn't behave
The world was soundtape
Without my real friend
Did everything right
But I was so bored
She went to King James
And soon made a whole
What you bring to me
Lovin' in style, makin' it right with you in my mind
Oh, what you bring to me
You're lovin' on time, makin' it right and everything's fine
You bring to me
Lovin' on time, keepin' the fight, rollin' the high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you bring to me
Lovin' in doubt, keepin' it strong, shinin' with light
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you
What you bring to me, what you bring to me
Love (what you bring me)
