Let me be the one to rescue you
Let me be the one to bring you through
Girl I give you everything you need just when you need it
I just wanna get real close to you
Cause girl your life's an empty room
Let me keep filling up your heart when it's depleted
I could be going on and on of what I'll do
We could be quick going moderations up to you
I could be going on and on of what is wrong with me to you
If you want my loving, if you want my loving, we ain't gotta talk about it
It's done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done
If you want my loving, baby, if you want my loving but you already have it
It's done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done
For you it's done for me
That is what I usually do
That's how we do
Especially when I'm with you
I'd do it all for you
Yeah, nothing about you girl is fake
I never seen no masquerade
I learned to trust that it's true love and that you mean it
you're the type to keep it real
And I never question what you feel
Girl my heart just loves the way, the way you treat it
I could be going on and on of what I'll do
We could be quick going moderations up to you
I could be going on and on and on what is wrong with me to you
If you want my love
We ain't gotta talk about it, it's done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done
If you want my love, babe, if you want my love, if you already have it, it's done, done, done, it's done, done, done, done
Over you it's done, over you it's done, if you want my love
We ain't gotta talk about it (we ain't gotta talk about it)
It's done, done, done, done (it's done, done, done, done)
Done, done, done, done (done, done, done)
If you wanna love me, babe (if you wanna love me)
You already have and you want it (you already have)
It's done, done, done, done (It's done, done, done, done)
Over you it's done (over you it's done)
Babe (baby)
That is what I usually do (that is what I usually do)
That's how we do (that's how we do) (that's how we do)
Especially when I'm with you (especially when I'm with you) (especially when I'm with you)
