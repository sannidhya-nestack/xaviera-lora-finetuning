I've opened my eyes (you're who you are)
I've opened my eyes (you're who you are)
I've opened my eyes (you're who you were)
I've opened my eyes
Just a pretender with your own agenda
Complete fabrication
A cold line, a gate with a cool masqueraded misrepresentation
It looked like the real thing
It shone like a new pin
And glittered like gold
You dressed it up well
I was someone to sell to
And you had me sold
A cheap imitation, a cruel replication
Something that I took for love
Not the genuine article, fake for original
Something that I took for love
I took for life (my true you are)
My true you are
Open my eyes, who you are?
Open my eyes, who you are?
Just an imposter, a cold hearted fraudster
The art of persuasion
A confident strictster, a charlatan fixer
An impersonation
I was caught by a cheap trick and you play it so slick
An underhand thinker
You hid in disguise and fed me with your lies
I fell hook, line and sinker
A cheap imitation, a cruel replication
And something that I took for love
Not the genuine article, fake or original
Something that I took for love
I took for love
I don't want phony love no more
I don't want phony love no more
I don't want phony love no more
I don't want phony love
Now I know
The fact from the fiction
I've seen the light
Now I know
The truth from the lies
The wrong from the right
A cheap imitation
A cruel replication
And something that I took for love
Not the genuine article
Fake for original
Something that I took for love
A cheap imitation, a cruel replication
And something that I took for love
Not the genuine article, fake for original
Something that I took for love
I took for love (Who you are)
Who am I? (Who you are)
Who am I? (Who you are)
Who am I? (Who you are)
