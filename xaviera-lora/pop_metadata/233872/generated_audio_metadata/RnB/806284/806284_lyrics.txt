You walk around lately, everyday
And you really don't have very much to say
All you do is get on the telephone
Talking to your girlfriend about what's going on at home
You're trying to fight your way through all of this mess
You thinkin' maybe leavin' might happen fast
What's goin' on behind these walls, ooh
What's goin' on, yeah, is there anything at all?
What's goin' on behind these walls, ooh
What's goin' on, yeah, if a stranger like me should call
Hey, you hate to go home after working hard all day
you know that maybe you have to pay
Pulling you dry and you just sit and you cry
Precious little tears just run down your cheek and you wonder why
You're trying to fight your way through all of this mess
It's got you thinking maybe leaving might happen best
What's going on behind these walls?
What's going on?
Is there anything at all?
What's going on?
What's going on baby?
Behind these walls?
Who?
What's going on?
Yeah, yeah
If a stranger like me should call
Hey
Yes
You're trying to fight your way through all of this mess
Just got to think it
What's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what going on, what's going on? (Behind these walls, ooh)
What's going on? Is there anything, is there anything at all? (What's going on behind these walls?)
Hey, if a stranger like me should call
What's going on behind these walls?
What's going on behind these walls?
