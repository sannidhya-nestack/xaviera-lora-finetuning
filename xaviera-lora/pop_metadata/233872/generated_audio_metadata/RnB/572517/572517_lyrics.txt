I'm making it
I'm
I'm
Sometimes I feel I'm going under
Can't breathe, can't see, I start to wonder
Is there a chance my life will not turn into
What I want it to be, yeah
Got no control of the situation
Red lights, stop signs, no invitation
Need a break, I can't take no more
Of what is going on
I never thought that I would be everything that I wanna be
And all that I dreamed would become my reality and I would see, yeah
So many opportunities chances to fulfill my destiny
Somehow in time my life has changed and somebody's watching over me
What you give is what you get in this life
Make a chance and take the risk, it's alright
If you feel like everything is just okay
Step it up, change your ride and go your way
And find the reason to be walking in your shoes
And walk the walk and talk the talk you need to come through
Do you know, do you know, it's all up to you
I never thought that I would be everything that I wanna be
And all that I dreamed would become my reality and I would see, yeah
With so many opportunities, chances to fulfill my destiny
Somehow in time my life has changed and somebody's watching over me
And I don't know if you are standing by my side
Are you the reassuring feeling when I need a helping hand
Are you the voice inside that's telling me the way that I should turn
The way to turn
I never thought that I would be everything that I wanna be
And all that I dreamed would become my reality and I would see, yeah
So many opportunities, chances to fulfill my destiny
Somehow in time my life has changed
Somebody's watching, watching over me
And all that I dream would become a reality and I would see
Something new and different and different and different and different and different and different
(Somebody's watching over me)
So many opportunities
So many opportunities
So many opportunities (in reality and I will see)
Somebody's watching over me (turning these times into my destiny)
Somebody's watching over me (oh, how I've been taught my life is changing)
Somebody's watching over me (somebody's watching over me)
Somebody's watching over me
Yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So many options
