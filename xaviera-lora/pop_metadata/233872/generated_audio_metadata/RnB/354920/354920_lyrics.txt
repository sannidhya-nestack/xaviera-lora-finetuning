I turn and all I see
Shadows cover me
The mirror doesn't lie
Another lonely night
Your picture in my head
But like an hourglass
I can't replace what once was there
How can I make believe what I feel when I'm still crying
There's nothing I can say, another part of me is dying
I can't go on, no more, no more pretending
All I hear you say, you don't love me anymore
Anymore
The fragrance of your hair
At night I feel you near
The motion of your touch
The one that meant so much
Your memory touches me
But there's no way to erase all the tears so I can't see
How can I make believe what I feel when I'm still crying
There's nothing I can say, another part of me is dying
I can't go on, no more, no more pretending
All I hear you say
You don't love me anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
How can I make believe what I feel when I'm still crying
There's nothing I can say, another part of me is dying
I can't go on, no more, no more pretending
All I hear you say, you don't love me anymore
How can I make believe what I feel when I'm still crying
Nothing I can say, I know the part of me is dying
I can't go on, no more, no more pretending
All I hear you say, you don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
Oh why
You don't love me anymore
Anymore
Oh, why did you leave me?
Why?
