Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Ooh, I swear she bad, and she know she the baddest bitch
But ooh, she make me mad,'cause she say that I'll never get
Between her legs, one thing that seem relevant
She don't swing my way, at least that is what she claim, but
If there's a first time to everything you ever did
She say she love her man, but I ain't tryna hear that shit
'Cause what we got is special, nah not special but it's sexual
And girl my sexual is oh so special though but you's a tease (shawty you's a tease)
Why you doing this to me? (why you doing this to me shawty)
You always do what you doing like you don't know what you doing
But you know just what you doing to me

Why you doing this to me? (why you doing this to me shawty)
You always do what you're doing like you don't know what you're doing
But you know just what you're doing to me
Ooh look at that ass
It's looking like a couple twins, it's up under that dress
I know a lot of women that say are we just friends
They be checking for me always texting TV when they say they lonely yeah we homies but
There's a first time to everything you ever did
She say she love her man but I ain't tryna hear that shit
Cause what we got is special, nah not special but it's sexual
And girl my sexual is oh so special though but choose a tease
