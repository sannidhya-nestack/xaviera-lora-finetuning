Baby, I see you're falling out of love
Lying here's the top, no attitude but stay there
I pray to God above
That you give up some latitude
Just open up your heart
Satisfy my curiosity
Can you really leave me this way?
Another shot in the dark
Against all probability
I think that our love can be the same
Over and over we've been through this before
Lord knows how hard we tried (we tried, we tried)
Baby, now maybe this thing won't work anymore
I think I love you still more
Baby, don't turn your back on love (You turn your back to me and I am turned to set you free)
Baby, you I still dream of (You're my love and mine, I'll be yours and you'll be mine)
Baby
I know I can make things right
But I wish that you were here tonight for one
I just want you to see
That it's me for you and you for me
Just open up your heart
Satisfy my curiosity
Can you really lead me this way?
Another shot in the dark
Against all probability I think that our love can be saved
Over and over we've been through the same before
Lord knows how hard we've tried (we've tried, we've tried)
Baby now maybe this thing won't work anymore
I think our love can still thrive (yes, oh baby)
Don't turn your back on love (you turn it back to me)
I in turn will set you free, baby
If you are still dreamin' of our love combined
I'll be yours and you'll be mine, baby
Don't turn your back on love (you turned your back to me)
Now you turn to set me free (baby)
It's you I still dream of (and with my love divine)
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
With a bit of understanding, we can work it out
I don't wanna be demanding, that's not what love's about
With a bit of understanding, we can work it out
I don't wanna be demanding, that's not what love's about
Over and over we've been through the same before
Lord knows how hard we've tried (we've tried, we've tried)
Baby, now maybe this thing won't work anymore
But I think y'all are lookin' still fine (yes, so, baby)
Don't turn your back on love
You turn it back to me, and I in turn will set you free
Baby, if you are still dreamin'
And if our love combined, I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Baby, don't turn your back on love
You turn it back to me, and I in turn will set you free
