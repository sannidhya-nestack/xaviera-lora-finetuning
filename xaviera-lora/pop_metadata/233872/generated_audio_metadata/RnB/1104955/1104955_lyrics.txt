Chain chain chain, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Chain chain chain, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Why you say it's time to go
To the place nobody knows
To the place nobody knows
I'll be with you
And if the story gets the end
I will dream to hold your hand
I will dream to hold your hand
I've been praying to hold your hand (I've been praying to hold your hand)
I'll be with you
And if the story gets the end
I will pray to hold your hand
I will pray to hold your hand
I will pray to hold your hand
I've been pretty hard to hit
