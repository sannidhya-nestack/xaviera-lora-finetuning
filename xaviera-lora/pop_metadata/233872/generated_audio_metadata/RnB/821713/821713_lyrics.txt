Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It was so easy and life was so sweet
Nothing could be sweeter than the love we've got between us
The look in your eyes that say that you want me
Holding me, dodging me, you lit a fire in me
I want the world to know I'm here for you
And when I dream, I only dream of you
I want the world to know I'm here for you
And when I dream, I only dream of you
And now it ain't easy, and life it ain't sweet
We became strangers that pass by in the street (no, no)
I look like you but you don't see me (no, no)
I long for you (for you)
I cry for you (for you)
But how do I get through?
I want the world to know I'm here for you
And when I dream, I only dream of you
I want the world to know I'm here for you
And when I dream, I only dream of you
I know how you feel, I know we can heal it (oh no)
Holding on to our dreams so long
I just thought I'd be strong
I want the world to know
I'm here for you, I'm here for you
And when I dream, I only dream of you
I wonder what to know
I'm here for you
And when I dream, I only dream of you
I only dream of you
I wonder what to know
I only dream of you
And when I dream, I only dream of you
I wonder what you know
