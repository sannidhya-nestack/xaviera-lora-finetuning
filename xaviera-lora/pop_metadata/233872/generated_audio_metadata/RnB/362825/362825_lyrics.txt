I'm glad to see you once again
And to know you're doing better
Shared precious memories
Came into my head
Mmm, when I saw you standing there
Oh my heart began to melt
From remembering all the good times that we shared (that we shared, that we shared, that we shared)
Oh oh, I wish it would have worked out
We would still be together
We had much love for each other
But we gave up too soon
Oh, though we've been apart
You were always in my heart
I still cherish every moment that we had
So many nights I cried, wishing you were by my side
And not having you now, oh it makes me sad, oh
Too bad that our relationship
We had a lot to give each other
But not enough to make it worth
And I promise you'll always have (you'll always have)
A place in my heart (a place in my heart)
And in my life (and in my life)
I often prayed we would make it
To become husband and wife (to become husband and wife)
I wish it would (I wish it would've worked out)
And we would still be together
We had much love for each other
But we gave up too soon
Although we've been apart
You were always in my heart
I still cherish every moment that we had
So many nights (so many nights) I cried (wishing you) wishing you were by my side (and not having you now makes me sad)
I still cherish you (I still cherish you)
I love you, yes I do (And you know that I do, I do)
Love you (I still cherish you) (I cherish you)
Cherish you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I still love you, love you, I still cherish you
