When the night falls cold and the shadows grow
I feel myself fall, where else can I go?
I need you most when the fog is low
You light me like a ghost, stars above
Lost in the maze, silence in my mind
I count the days for your light to find
I need you most
When the spark is love
Guide me like a host
Stars above
Ooh, your spark shines bright
In the deep of night
Ooh, hold me tight
Feel the endless fire
I need you most when it's darkest love
Guide me like a host, stars above
Lost in the maze, silence in my mind
I count the days for your light to find
I need you most when it's darkest love
Guide me like a host, stars above
Ooh,'til your star shines bright
In the deep of night
Ooh, hold me tight
Good in the sight
I need you most
When it's darkest love
Got me like a host, stars above
