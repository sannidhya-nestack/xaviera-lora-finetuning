I heard he mistreats you
Baby girl glasses can't cover that mark on your eye
And no amount of make up can hide your self respect
Worth or an ounce of your pride
And I know that it's hard for you to get up and leave
But you know that his loving ain't right
You don't need him, he's out cheating
And I'm here losing my mind'cause I realize
I'm in love with a girl who's in love with my friend
Though we treat each other like stone I know she's a gem
When she smiles how my heart burns a hole through my skin
I'm in love with a girl who's in love with my friend
Friend, friend, she's in love with my friend
Friend, she's a love of mine
Friend, friend
Friend, friend
Maybe it's stupid, maybe it's crazy
No man's supposed to (treat a woman like that) no, no
You don't deserve it, know that you're worth it
I'll treat you better than he can
Ooh, what I wanna do to him
You begged me not to
Your tears told me I got all my money on hold
You keep them close
Enemies closer
He ain't no friend of mine
I've realized
I'm in love with a girl who's in love with my friend
Though her dreams are like stone, I know she's a gem
When she smiles, how my heart burns, oh, through my skin
I'm in love with a girl who's in love with my friend (friend, friend)
She's in love with my (friend, friend)
She's in love with my friend (friend, friend), she's in love with my friend, yeah (friend, friend)
The love that you give him ain't love that he earned
You deserve to love and be loved every turn
Your love's the wind and your love's the sea and
Your love's the world without boundaries to be in
He'll never hurt you again, he'll never touch you again
And he's no friend of mine (I'm in love with a girl, I'm in love with my friend)
I'm in love with a girl who's in love with him (I'm in love with a girl who's in love with my friend) (She's a girl, she's a girl) (I'm in love with a girl and she's in love with him) (I'm in love with a girl who's in love with my friend) (She's a girl, she's a girl) (I'm in love with a girl who's in love with him) (I'm in love with a girl who's in love with my friend) (She's a girl, she's a girl) (I'm in love with a girl who's in love with him) (I'm in love with a girl who's in love with my friend) (She's a girl, she's a girl)
I'm in love with a girl, love with a girl
I'm in love with a girl, I'm in love with a girl
Was in love with my friend
You are, you are, you are, you are, you are
