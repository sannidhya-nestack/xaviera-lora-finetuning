Now's the time to get close
Oh baby, light is whispering
I'm yours forever
Light the sky up when we touch
Always nice and slow, I'm sure
It's you that I adore
Let's make the move up to my room
I'll get you there one time or two
Whatever
Every moment a precious jewel
That I spend with you I'm sure
It's you that I adore
It's you
I tell my secrets to
No more loneliness me more
It's you that I adore
It's true that you complete my blues (and you)
Everything I could want in a girl is you that I adore
Girl you know, tonight we breaking all of gravity's rules
If love making were a crime
Then life on top of you would be just as soon
And I'm feeling all your moves
And I like your shoes just being real bad
You that I adore (you that I adore)
It's time to lay you down and show you what I've waited for
A delicacy tempting me
I'll savour the moment and start at your feet
And you know there's so much more
Let me close this door, you know we need this
It's you that I am
It's you, babe, I'll tell my secrets too (ooh)
No more lonely nights, me or more
It's you that I adore (ooh)
It's true, that you complete my blue (ooh)
Everything I could want in a girl
It's you that I adore (ooh)
I was all alone in this madness
But now that you got my back
I look upon my riches
You're my treasure girl, my special mission
I thank God that I found you
Let the sunshine on our path
I'll take you there, I promise
We'll keep romance lady, that is the plan
I tell my secrets to no more lonely nights me more
It's you that I adore (it's true)
Bet you can play my blues (and you)
Everything I could want in a girl
It's you that I, it's you that I, it's you that I know
I tell my secrets to, no more lonely nights for me or you
Girl it's true, I'll say I do if you want me to, oh-oh-oh-oh
