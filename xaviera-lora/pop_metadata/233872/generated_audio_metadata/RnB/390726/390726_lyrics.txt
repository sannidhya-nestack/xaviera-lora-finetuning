First, I'd like to know why we're the center of attraction
I'm not flashing but yo, I'll hold the show
When you heard Ray J hip hop disco and said yeah
They'll keep on going, we combine all forces with the man
And I say hold it
Then right there you back it up
I'd like to see you if you refuse
My girl you're out of luck
If you want music kids take blues
And Scorpio has now been born
If you want fashion I'm not asking
Now what should I put on
If you want laughter
That comes after, the bills been painful
If you want sex then that comes next for damn right you ain't gotta pull
If you act nasty, fast and sassy I'm there to make you shout
If you want poor shit I'm not bullshit
Move your hand I got your man so check it out

So check it out
Wait for the lights to go down and I'll get up, I'm in the mood
Moving into the groove, I'll be on top
Light the cream on the cake, pump to the song
For old times sake
You'll be a maniac when I react like I'm out of jail
Won't wear a shirt, I won't get hurt'cause thank God you've cut your nails
When I say check it on this record it means to take me in
Or try to get with DMX and see why I call her Ben, yo hit it out
Get'em DMX!
Yo yo yo yo DMX yeah you next
I think you'll have to strip
Better make it fast because she's licking her lips
I'll have one and you'll have one and we will both have some fun
But do you think that you could when she say push it real good
This not a diss don't get pissed miss just ask and please
Next time you tease I'm here at bad hand on my head
