Yeah, alright
Girl you make me smile, yeah
If you only knew how you're affecting me
How I wanna stay wherever you make me
I can't turn left from right or even up from down
Things like this continue whenever you're around
I just can't explain how you're affecting me
Sometimes you look so good that I think you make me leave
All I wanna do is to communicate with you
Yeah when I see you walking by, see you walking by
I just can't help myself, can't help myself, I can't help myself
I wanna stop and stare, just wanna stop and stare and take a look at you baby
You put that smile on me
And I can't help myself, I can't help myself (yeah)
No, I can't help myself, I can't help myself (no, I can't)
No, I can't help myself, I can't help myself (oh, oh, oh)
You put that smile on me, yeah, mm
You're the type of girl not easy to et
I could've known you for a year
Guess it seems like we just only met
Like a diamond in the rough or a pearl beneath the sea
You're so special to me
When I see you walkin' by, see you walkin' by
I just can't help myself, I can't help myself (No I can't, no I can't)
I wanna stop and stare, just wanna stop and stare
Take a look at you baby (Oh)
You put that smile on me (You put that smile on me)
And I can't help myself, I can't help myself
I can't help myself (No I can't help myself)
I can't help myself, I can't help myself (oh no, no, no)
No, I can't help myself, I can't help myself (I can't help myself)
You put that smile on me, yeah
You put that smile on me (When I see you walkin' by, see you walkin' by)
I just can't help myself, can't help myself (I just wanna, I just wanna)
I wanna stop and stare, just wanna stop and stare and take a look at you, baby (You put that smile on me, put that smile on me)
And I can't help myself, can't help myself
No, I can't help myself, I can't help myself (No, I can't, no, I can't)
No, I can't help myself, I can’t help myself (No, I can't, no)
You put that smile on me (You put that smile on me)
Yeah (Oh, and I can't help myself)
