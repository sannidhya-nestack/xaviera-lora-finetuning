We're gonna find another way
This love is good enough to say
Hold on to you
And we're gonna see it's not too late
We're gonna have to celebrate what we've been through
What we've been through
I know we have problems sometimes
But I just can't let go
I ain't be a fool
Without you my heart would be broken
So I'll hold on to you
I'll hold on to you
You don't have to tell me to hold on, hold on, hold on
I'll hold on to you, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Your love has a way with our lives
Shows us exactly what we ought to do
So won't you just hold on to me as I hold, hold on to you
Hold on to you
And I'll never ever be afraid
To stay around the love we made
It's not hard to do
And if it ever felt like paradise
It was because you're just that nice
Won't you hold on
Too
I know we have problems sometimes
But I wanna make it with nobody but you
Without you my heart would be broken
So I'll hold on to you, baby
I'll hold on to you
You don't have to tell me to hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on to you
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Some nights I wake with a start
Wondering exactly what would I do
Without you my heart would be broken so I'll hold on to you
Hold on to you, yeah (hold on to you, yeah)
Hold on to you, baby, need you to (hey)
Oh love has a way with our lives
Shows us exactly what we ought to do
So won't you just hold on to me as I hold, hold on to you
Hold on to you
Without you my heart would be broken so I'll
Hold on to you
You make me ring true
Without you my heart would be broken so I'll
Hold on to you
What else can I do?
But hold on to you
