There's a strength inside I feel
And now I'm being rebuilt, oh-oh-oh
I can't take the easy way out
I must end this pain
Someway, somehow
Instead of hide, oh
Bringing me down
Our focus on love is filling me up
Making me better than I was
It would've been so easy
To curl up in a ball and die
It would've been so easy
To give up and not even try, it would've been so easy
To lose my mother, kill her
But I'd rather grow old, take the high road
And move on with my life
At first it seemed hard
To not call him up and curse him out
With a heavy heart
I bet it got off the couch, oh yeah
Tending the scars, oh yeah
From the latest burn
Don't backpedal
Don't fall in that hole
Don't be afraid to just let it go
So easy
To curl up in a ball and die
It would've been so easy
To give up and not even try
It would've been so easy
To lose my mother, give mine
But I'd rather grow, take the horror and move
It would've been so easy
To curl up in a ball and die
It would've been so easy
To give up and not even try
It would've been so easy
To lose my mother, you're mine
But I'd rather grow up, take the high road and move on with my life
Ooh, yeah, there was a force deep down inside
It was always there, just waiting to be unbound
When he said he didn't need it
I thought I was the end of hell
But I'd rather grow, just let it all go
And move on with my, move on with my life (You make it so easy)
It would've been so easy to give up and not even try
Easy to lose my mother
You're mine, but I'd rather go
Take the high road and move on with my life
Yeah, it's time to let it go (yeah, it's time to let it go)
Time to take the high road (take the high, time to take the high road)
Yeah, it's time to let it go (yeah, it's time to let it go)
Yeah, it's time to grow, time to grow
