This ain't no free spin
Better think of the mess you're in
When you see the tears I cry
Better set aside your pride
This ain't no jack and Jill
Won't fall down the hill
Can't take that bitter pill, no
I told you day to day
Better hear the words I say
My love just slips away
This ain't no common ground
No matter what's going down
No matter bout circumstance
What happened to hit you by chance
This ain't no vacation trip
Won't go down with this ship
Can't shoot it from the hip
No no no no no no
I told you day to day, better hear the words I say
My love just slips away (my love keeps slipping away)
I told you day by day, better hear the words I say
My love just slips away (my love keeps slipping away)
Please away
I told you day by day my love
Just slips away (slips away)
Don't take advantage of the love I get
My love just slips away
Don't take for granted
The love I made
My life just slips away
I told you day by day
Better hear the words I say
My love just slips away (my love keeps slipping away)
I told you day by day
Better hear the words I say
My love just slips away (my love keeps slipping away)
I told you day by day
Better hear the words I say
My love just slips away
My love keeps slipping away
I told you day by day
But in the words I say
My love just slips away
My love keeps slipping away
