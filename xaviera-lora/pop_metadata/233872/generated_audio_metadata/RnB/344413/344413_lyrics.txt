I love the fact that when you laugh it's like the heavens listening
Like the angels just visit to listen to you don't tell me different
Ever since you went missing I'm tripping you dipping got me wishing
I had never flipped it on you never snuck it never did set on you
I was wildin' I was wrong I'm so sick of you getting gone
Up in VIP talking birds and bees to the shouties with no panties on
Soon as they get ready to the telly break'em off drop'em off cut'em off
Back to reality and baby I miss you
Girl I swear if you was here I'd kiss you
And tell you I'm so sorry that I dissed you
Baby please believe ain't no other girl for me
Baby take me back because I, I can't explain the way I feel without you here to push me
No motivation, I'm wasting time trying to ease my mind
Now I done smoked so many packs of cigarettes
Since you left I've been praying to God
Partying hard, drinking back the fact you're gone
I was stupid, I was dumb
Girl, I swear you're the only one
Worth a thing to me, all them other skeezers were just teezers and I
I just can't stop crying, wanna die and I don't know which way to go, it's so cold
In my bed without you here
Girl, I
Kiss you
Girl, I swear if you was here I'd
Kiss you
And tell you I'm so sorry that I ditched you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby, please believe, ain't no other girl for me
Girl, take me back because I (ain't got time for this game, don't play)
Know where I wanna be, where I wanna stay
Heart in your hands, girl, please don't leave
Even though I'm out late chasing the cheese
Girl, you the only one I want to please
Go hard with your broad love, I don't need
I'ma get right but you can't let go
I ain't never felt this way before
Can't let go of what I already know
So hard bro this time I don't know
What to do to get back with you
On my knees like girl I do
Promise to be honest I'll tell the truth
Can't win for losing I'm missing you
It's not the same without you boo
Gotta get her back fast before she find another dude
I'm feeling like damn I can't lose
Girl I swear if you was here I'd kiss you
And tell you I'm so sorry that I dished you
Baby please believe ain't no other girl for me
Girl take me back because I miss you
Girl I swear if you was here I'd kiss you
And tell you I'm so sorry that I dish you
Baby please believe ain't no other girl for me
Baby take me back because I
