For every drink I buy
You want to take the bottle home
I show you the stars up in the sky
And you want one for your own
Now I showed you the world
You want to see the universe
I'll take good care of you baby, baby
And then you'll want a private nurse
I can't help giving all I've got to give
I guess that's just my style
But if I give you an inch
You know you'll want to take a mile
I'll give you one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and
You wanna take a mile
You wanna take a mile
Oh, a woman like you
Just can't be satisfied
I use up all my love now baby
Like it's going out of style
I gave you my heart
But you took my soul
I gave you sweet, sweet music, baby
You only want a rock and roll
Hey, I can't help giving all I got to give
I guess that's just my style
But if I give you an inch
You know you wanna take a mile
I'll give you one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and
You'll wanna take a mile
If you wanna visit France
And I say, "Baby, hey, that's alright"
You say you won't be gone too long
And then you stay out all night
Hey, everybody knows
I'm a sixty minute man
But if I give you just a little bit, baby
You take all you can
Hey, I can't help giving all I've got to give
I guess that's just my style
But if I give you an inch
You'll wanna take a mile
I'll give you one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and
Oh, you'll wanna take a mile
You'll wanna take a mile, baby
You want all of my lovin'
Don't wanna take a mile
Yeah, just the one-ish, baby
Don't wanna take a mile
Give you all that I can now, darling, darling
