Wish you'd understand me
Come back where we began
Fell in love so deeply
Wonder where you ran
Your smile could light the night
Now shadows fill the room
Used to hold me tight, now all I feel is grown
Why'd you have to change? You were my perfect plan
Wishing you'd read me, to love you as I am
Whispered dreams at midnight
Now they're fading fast
Used to be my life
How long will this sign?
Promises are broken
Hearts are torn apart
Words remain unspoken
Breaking from the start
Why'd you have to change?
You were my perfect plan
You seemed to remake
To love you as I am
Whispered dreams at midnight
Now they're fading fast
Used to be my light
How long will this last
Promises are broken
Hearts are torn apart
Words remain unspoken
Breaking from the start
Why'd you have to change
You were my perfect twin
Wishing you'd remake
To love you as I am
