Oh my, you look splendid
Oh my, put your hands on it
Remember when you said it
Remember when you cherished what was right in front of you
And I've been praying for a lullaby
That not only puts your head to sleep
But makes you feel arrested
And I could stare at you come back another time
We always lose each other where we just ended
If we can't agree on this
Who the hell are we supposed to be?
If we can't agree on this
Who the hell are we supposed to be?
I've been falling over time
I can't tell you's from mine
Tell me who's closing their minds
Is it righteous, justified?
Which intentions are we driven by?
Am I blind or just tired?
Wanna keep you by my side
But something creeps up from behind
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If we can't agree on this
Who the hell are we supposed to be?
If we can't agree on this
Who the hell are we supposed to be?
I've been falling over time
I can't tell who's from mine
Tell me who's closing their minds
Is it righteous, justified?
Which intentions are we driven by?
Am I blind or just tired?
Wanna keep you by my side
But something creeps up from behind
If we can't agree on this
Who the hell are we supposed to be?
If we can't agree on this
Who the hell are we supposed to be?
I've been falling all the time
I can't tell who's right
Tell me who's closing their minds
Is it righteous just to fight?
Which intentions are we driven by?
Never paying for this time
Wanna keep it real
You melt my soul and something creeps up from behind
