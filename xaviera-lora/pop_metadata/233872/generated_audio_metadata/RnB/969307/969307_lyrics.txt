You, you, you just hit the jackpot
I'll take us to the moon, we can fly south
I'll back up what I talk
with me, it will be
Better than you ever thought
There's a long, long line
Everybody wanna ride this ride
Everybody wanna feel this vibe
If you light it, pass you by
That's my disrespectful
I ain't like them other girls (yo)
They're so cool (woo)
I could win awards (yo)
Once I go you gon' feel remorse (yo)
Why you hesitate?
Tell me what you waiting for?
Oh, what you waiting for?
Oh, what you waiting for?
Oh, what you waiting for?
Oh, oh, aye, aye
Don't you wanna level up?
et them other chicks, I got that real love
You know you want to but
It was right in your backs
But what they got to do with me?
There's a long, long line
Everybody wanna ride this ride
Everybody wanna feel this vibe
If you love the bad you bad
That's mad disrespectful
I ain't like them other girls
That's no fool
I can win a war
On side
Girl you gon' feel famous
Why you hesitating
Tell me what you waiting for
Oh what you waiting for
Oh what you waiting for
Oh, what you waiting for?
Oh, oh, ay, ay, ay, ay
Lie down at the glass (I know it hurts)
I'm so full (woo)
I could win the world (I know it hurts)
I'm sorry, don't you gon' feel me more? (I know it hurts)
Why you hesitate? (I know it hurts)
Tell me what you waiting for?
Oh, what you waiting for?
Oh, what you waiting for?
Oh, what you waiting for?
Oh, oh, ay, ay, ay, ay
I, I, I, I
There's a long, long line
Everybody want to ride this ride
Everybody want to feel this fine
If you love the fast you ride
Tick, tick, tock, yo
I ain't like them other girls, other girls
Who, who, I come in the worst
One side, don't you come feel famous
Why you hesitating? Tell me what you waiting for
