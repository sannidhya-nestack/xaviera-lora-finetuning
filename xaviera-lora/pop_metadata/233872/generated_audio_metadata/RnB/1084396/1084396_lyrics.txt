(whistling)
Today, the early afternoon
A park, the sun shines brightly
A boy, so young and friendly
The girl, just sweet as candy
The boy is flying his kite
It seems he's doing alright
The girl plays with her happy
Who knew they'd be so lucky
Oh God, what if she says no?
He's scared'cause he really likes her
He knows his chances are slim
Who cares, he asked her anyway
I really like you, hey boy
I know I'm lucky, hey boy
Just come out with me, hey boy
Just give me a chance
Why not? I've always liked you
Why not? I've never met you
Why not? It's still so early
Why not? I'll have fun surely
Hey boy, I'm glad I met you
Hey boy, I wanted to kiss you
Hey girl, don't leave so early
Aw shucks, I could've kissed you
Aw shucks, I could've kissed you
Aw shucks, I could've kissed you
