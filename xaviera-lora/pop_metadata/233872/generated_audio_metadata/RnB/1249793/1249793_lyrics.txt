Walking down the station
Hearts ablaze in fire
Dreams of destinations higher and higher
Tickets in my pocket
Winding whispers loud
Can you feel it coming?
Thunder in the clouds
Riding that train
Never looking back
Riding that train
We're on the right track
Whistle blowing sharply
Rails are shining bright
Futures at the doorstep
Rolling through the night
Flip the rail of hope now
Feel the engine roar
Onward we keep moving
Always wanting more
Riding that train
Never looking back
Riding that train
We're on the right track
Whistle blowing sharply
Rails are shouting bright
Futures at the doorstep
Rolling through the night
Drift the rail of hope now, feel the engine roar
Onward we keep moving, always wanting more
Riding that train, never looking back
Riding that train, we're on the right track
