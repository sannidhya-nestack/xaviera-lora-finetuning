I remember you
Won't you come again
I remember thinking
It couldn't get much finer
A summer long
We held hands
We thought those nights would never end
Summer's come to an end, yeah
The sound of the music sounds so sweet it brought you bang again
I remember you (I remember you)
Won't you come again?
I remember thinking (I remember you)
It couldn't get much finer
This went so bad
Went skipping by
That no one ever would ever do
Summer's come to an end, yeah
The sound of the music sounds so sweet it puts you back, yeah
I remember you, I remember you, most of the time of my day
I remember you, most of the time of my day
Summer's come to an end, yeah
The sound of the music sounds so sweet
It brought you back again
The sound of the music sounds so sweet
I remember you (I remember you)
Won't you come again?
I remember thinking (I remember you)
It couldn't get much finer
I remember you
(I remember you) won't you come again?
I remember thinking
(I remember you) it couldn't get much faster
