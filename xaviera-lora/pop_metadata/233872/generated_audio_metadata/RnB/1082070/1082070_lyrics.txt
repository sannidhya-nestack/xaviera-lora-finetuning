Please take a hammer to my eyes
That would be the end of all the lies
I'd still hold so tight
To the shattered pieces of glass
I'd see the whole world through
Judgment of who
Please take a hammer to my eyes
That would be the end of all the lies
I'd still hold so tight
To the shattered pieces of glass
I'd see the whole world through
Judgmental fool
I'm a judgmental fool
I swear I'm trying hard
I'm a judgmental fool
I see through color and dirt
Fire and water, I
We fail to see the true colors
The true colors of you and me
The reality
Is that we've only got an image of each other
Image of each other
Judgmental fool
I'm a judgmental fool
I swear I'm trying hard
I'm a judgmental fool
I see through color and dirt
Fire and water
I, I try
Not to be so hard on myself
I try (I try) not to be so hard on myself
For being human, only human
I'm a judgmental fool, I swear I'm trying hard
I'm a judgmental fool, I see through color and dirt
Fire and water, I
