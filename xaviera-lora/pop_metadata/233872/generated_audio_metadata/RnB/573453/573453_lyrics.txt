When you feel like a drop in the deep blue sea
Just a number in infinity
When a waitress treats you insignificantly
Take a stand man
Tell her, tell her, tell her to throw some bacon on it
With cheese
Get some bacon on there, honey
If you please
With some bacon on it
Everything will be fine
Everything will be fine
Well, a caveman dreamed of a better way
To coax a little flavor out of his bloody raw prey
He built a fire one night to keep the sable tooth at bay
A chunk of wild boar fell into the fire and we had bacon
And thus began civilization with bacon
And they taught the little cave children about baking
And it was fine
No sense in waiting on a miracle
Get to grind it up, grind it up, grind it up, baby doll
Word with some bacon on it
Everything will be fine
Everything will be fine
Got some bacon on it
Got some bacon on it
I throw some bacon on it
I throw some bacon on it
