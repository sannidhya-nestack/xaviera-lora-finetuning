Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Once again (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) (Say Jazzy) A lot of people say I'm wasting my time plus all of my talents but I'm steady making joints so their point is not valid so unless you're in my shoes I suggest you stay silent cause I'm a calm collected cat with a tendency to get violent but yo
That's not the way that I prefer to handle business
I've been dealing with some cats that claim to have my best interest
If that's the case then why y'all hawking me something relentless
Dealing with y'all could be worse than going to the dentist
And man that's not the way it should be
Or maybe it shouldn't mixed emotions got me following instincts
Like Cuba Gooding and I know
Deep down what I feel is what I feel and what I feel is real to me it's hard to keep it concealed
What I do for sake of arguing I hold it inside
Mindin' we mindin' we need to holla and like swallow our pride
This is a ride we plan to take on until we die
And if you with us then stand by our side and say Jazz Addict
They just say (they just say)
A lot of people doubt me, speaking evil out they mouthpiece
Saying I don't spend enough time with rhymes, so now I'm all about beats
Yeah I can vouch for that, steady broke with no loot
Cause I been shelling out for wax, be checking in my houses
Stacks of vinyl, final releases, text pressings and such
I get a rush, erupt like a vinyl over lush
When the vinyl's in my clutch, I find them vital so I light em up
Like Fontaine and ninth, all day and night my people lining up
To hear the sounds of the three man band, eight man crew
I hold my own, any one of my clique yo they can too
As individuals we define rhyme and climb to the pinnacle
Every line of mine shines till you find that I'm invisible
Refined criminals even take time to rewind syllables
I combine spirituals with sublime lyricals and divine miracles
You never find feeling through rhyme, mine deliver you, yo
The feeling is true, I know y'all feel it too, it's jazz addicts
Say Jah Zay (Say Jah Zay)
A lot of y'all don't really understand the feeling I get
When it's time to spit and Rags comes in with a scratch to match his sick
We have the gift to resurrect the b-boy classic shit
Y'all have a fit to this ridiculous shit
I'm passionate and naturally this has to be
Pat down to the generation soon to come after me
The things change drastically, see why
Just gradually it turned to a tragedy
It was sad but I felt it was something we all had to see
Personally I was affected dramatically
I almost laughed at me
My family was backin' me
Now the torch been passed to me and I accept happily
So like a dashing athlete I use my track to speak
Half these sweet wanna be tough guys we rappin' weak
I tell'em all to have a seat as we conduct this masterpiece
It was a masterpiece, it was a masterpiece
It was a masterpiece, it was a masterpiece, it was a masterpiece
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh (D .J .Z)
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh (Now we gonna do a little something like this, now check it out y'all)
We go uh uh uh uh uh yeah yeah
Uh uh uh uh uh yeah yeah (Check it out, we going uh uh uh uh uh yeah yeah)
