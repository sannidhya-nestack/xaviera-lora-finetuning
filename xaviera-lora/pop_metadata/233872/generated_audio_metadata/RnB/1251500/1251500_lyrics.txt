Touch of a hand, breeze on my face
Heart beats so fast, it's a simple embrace
Eyes locked in time
Life's in the air
Words don't come easy
But I don't care
Simply falling in love
Light as a feather
Simply falling in love
Only get better
Moments we share
Silent in love
Feeling the magic inside the crowd
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Look in my heart
Moonshine so bright
Hand in your hand
Feels so right
Simply falling in love
Right as I fell in love
Simply falling in love
Only getting better
Walk in the dark, moonshine so bright
Hand in your hand, feels so right
Simply falling in love
Why does a friend of you, you, you, you, oh, oh, oh, oh, it seems so wrong, oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Why can't I?
Touch of a hand, breathes on my face
Heart beats so fast, it's a simple embrace
Eyes lock in time, last in the air
Heart beats so fast, it's a simple race
Eyes locked in time, that's in the head
Words don't come easy, but I don't care
Simply falling in love
Blind as a feather
And every falling rock
Only can I imagine
Momentary shift
Silent to loud
Feeling the magic inside of her
Holding me tight
You shake so tight
You shake so tight
Hand in your hand
I'm feeling so
Simply falling in love, light as a feather
Simply falling in love, only getting better
