When the walls come tumbling down
And there's panic all around
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
When the wolf is at your door
And he keeps coming back for more
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
I will be there to help you through
That's what I always do
And I'll be working on your case
Every night and day
Night and day
When it seems there's no way out
And we're heading deeper down
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Oh
I will be there to help you through
That's what I always do
And I'll be working on your gaze
Every night and day
Every night and day
When your dreams come crashing down
Just pick yourself up off the ground
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry (don't you cry)
Don't you cry (baby don't you cry)
Baby don't cry (baby don't you cry)
Don't you cry
