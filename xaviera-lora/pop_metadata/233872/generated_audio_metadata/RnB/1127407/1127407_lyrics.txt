Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You can leave or stay, but you can't do both at the same time
Come on, come on
Come release the day, shake it off, it's time to free your mind
Just leave it on the floor (get up, get up, get up, get up, get up)
Dancing out the door (get up, get up, get up, get up, get up)
Who cares what people say? (get up, get up, get up, get up, get up)
Leave'em if they hate
Got a vibe to catch and it's not yours (ba-ba-da-ba-da)
No, uh, dance the night away
If there's a problem then it must be yours (ba-ba-da-ba-da)
it ain't mine (ba-ba-da-ba-da)
God, uh, shake it, shake it, shake, shake it up (nah-nah-nah-nah)
Shake it, shake it, shake, shake it up (nah-nah-nah-nah)
Shake it, shake it, shake, shake it up (nah-nah-nah-nah)
Everybody get up
(Shake it, shake it, just shake it up)
Yeah, mm-hmm
Just leave it on the floor (Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up)
Dancing out the door (Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up)
Yeah, who cares what people say? (Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up)
Get up, get up (Get up, get up, get up, get up)

Free your mind and leave it on the floor
If there's a problem then it must be yours
Ain't really caring what them people say
I'ma go and dance the night away
Free your mind and leave it on the floor
If there's a problem then it must be yours
