Girl name Sally, out in Cali from the valley
Drive a brand new Denali
Her papa name is Charlie, ride a red and black Harley
And he don't like nobody but me, but me
And Sally came over last week and wasn't sober

When I see her daddy out everyday during his route
When he pass by he holler out "Yay !"

Have a good time (Hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry)
