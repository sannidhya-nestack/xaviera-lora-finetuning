I'm gonna see the best in you and if you wait for my last joy
The feast of new and famine comes with nothing to do
Stay there, just need me, come on, take my hand and follow me through
I'm gonna be the best for you, me and I say you're the best for me
Give or take now, don't know how long this will take now, yeah yeah yeah
I'm in a gang war, you're my sweet escape route
What you say now, what you wanna, what you wanna say now?
You're my way out of this crazy place now
Would you stay, would you stay around?
This is fate now, how we gonna take out
Living's on the break now, you're my favorite mate now, you're my mate now
Wherever I'ma bring you, my hands are found, find my way home, find my way home, you are
I'm gonna see the best in you and if you ain't for my life's joy
In a feast of new and feminine girls who know what to do
Stay there, just lead me, come on, take my hand and follow me through
I'm gonna be the best for you and girl, I see you're the
I'm gonna stay with you if you stay with me
No explain, no you explain to me
I'm gonna stay with you if you stay with
Me, we're explaining to you, explaining to me
World's a wait long, do we see the breaking dawn?
Promise long ago we'd make it work or break apart?
Should we say now we're not too high plus?
There's one way out, choose to restart
Time to take on, gotta go strong, all we need
It's hanging on without your heart
I'm half of my home, my soul intact
I can't take on more, this is a leap of faith
You're my only one without your love
I'm broken down, reaming down this road
Very long time
You're about to see the best in you, and if you remember, that's truly the face of new and feminine girls who know what to do
If you need me, come on, take my hand and follow me through
I'm gonna be the best for you
Because you're the best for me
I wanna stay around you, when you stay around me
When you're just playing no, you're just playing no, me
