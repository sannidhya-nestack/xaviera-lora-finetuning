Won't you stay here with me now?
Won't you stay here through the night?
When the morning comes I'll still be with you
Yeah, it's gonna be alright
Take my hand, oh don't you worry
I just wanna look into your eyes, yeah, yeah
We can take it slow now, girl
there's no hurry, yeah
It's gonna be alright
Just let go now, now, let's be together
that's the way we feel tonight
Let it show now, now we're together
Yeah, it's gonna be alright
Let's not try, try to stop, let's go, no, no
It's just the way it's supposed to be
Don't even think we could ever do without it
Baby, baby, baby, gotta stay with me
So just let go now, let's be together
That's the way we feel tonight
Just let it show now, now we're together
Babe, it's gonna be alright
Won't you stay here with me now, girl?
Won't you stay right through the night?
When the morning comes, you know I'll still be with you
Said, "Baby, babe, it's gonna be alright"
Yeah baby baby baby it's gonna be alright
I said baby baby it's gonna be alright
