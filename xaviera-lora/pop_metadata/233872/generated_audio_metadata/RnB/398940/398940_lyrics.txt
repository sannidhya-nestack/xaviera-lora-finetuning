Until the sweaty city takes your heart and melts your head
Until the people pile on top of each other
I'll take a mountain over metro buses any day
Take my loving to the mountain
And we can feel a little bit smaller together
A little bit bigger than alone
I'd like to feel a little bit smaller
A little bit bigger than alone
Ooh hey hey yeah
I like the way the tide rides up the shoreline
I can't decide if I'm dreaming the wave or if he's dreaming me
When you wake, will I take you to the ocean?
We'll swim the undertow into a deeper shade of sea where
We can feel a little bit smaller together
A little bit bigger than a loan, I'd like to
Feel it a bit smaller
A little bit bigger than a loan, bigger than a loan
Alright, come on
I dig the luminescence on the ocean
Take my lover, life years away
Light like the moon, I'd like to own a nice Italian restaurant on it
Called Luna D'Amour, what for?
So, we can feel a little bit smaller together
A little bit bigger than alone, I'd like to
Feel a little bit smaller
Little bit bigger than a lawn
Hey hey hey yeah
Now we can feel a little bit smaller together
A little bit bigger than alone
I'd like to feel a little bit smaller
A little bit bigger than alone
I'd like to feel a little bit
Feel a little bit, a little bit, little bit
A little bit bigger than alone
More bigger than alone
More bigger than alone
Much bigger than alone
When I'm with you
