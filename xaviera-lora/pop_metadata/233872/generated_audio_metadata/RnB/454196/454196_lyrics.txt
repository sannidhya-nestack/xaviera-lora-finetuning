See, I was praying for this day
Now that I finally got it here with me
It must be a blessing from God
I wanna cherish every moment that we share together baby
Cause you're my girl and I'm your man
And that's how it's gonna be baby
So listen, this is for you honey
See I was praying for her stay
So I can meet this girl of my dreams
And now she's standing right in front of me
I can't believe my eyes
Could it be the woman that I saw in my dreams
Is it all reality
I know I'm not crazy
She's so amazing
When I look into her eyes I see heaven
She must be an angel sent to me
Goddess bless me
I wanna say thank you God
I must be dreaming
When I saw that beautiful lady cross the road
So tell me what's the meaning
She must be from a different world
Body of a goddess
There's a sign that she's giving me food and butterflies
I don't know what's the meaning
Can it be that girl I think I'm in love?
Now the time has come so we could ride together
Loving you is all I wanna do forever
So many chances I would take
Just to see you smile on your face everyday
Cause you're my lady
Endless love I have for you is all eternal
Baby, take my hand so much that we can't handle
So baby, let's fly away to a place that we could be alone
Just you and I, I must be dreaming
When I saw that beautiful lady cross the road
So tell me what's the meaning?
She must be from a different world, body of a goddess
There's a sign that she's giving me feeling butterflies
I don't know what's the meaning, can it be there?
Ooh, I think I'm in love
Now that I've got you here with me, girl
We could sail away to paradise, ooh
Baby, take a ride on this love train
I'm so happy that you're in my life, baby, yeah
You turn me from a boy to a man
You complete me baby, baby, yeah
You turn me from a boy to a man
You complete me baby, baby, yeah
You drank me when I saw that beautiful face
Lady crossed the road, so tell me what's the meaning?
She must be from a different world (she must be from a different world)
Buddy, I ot it
There's a sign that she's giving me feeding butterflies (butterflies)
I don't know what's the meaning
Can it be that girl I think I'm in love? (I think I'm in love)
When I saw that beautiful lady cross the road, so tell me what's the meaning
She must be from a different world
Body of a goddess
There's a sign that she's giving me feeling butterflies
I don't know what you mean, baby
Can it be that girl? I think I'm in love
Think I'm in love
Think I'm in love
