In the rain I see him coming, in the back of his mind it's dawning
She means that much to me
And while the rain is falling
All the little birds are calling
She's worth that much you'll see
She'll come alive for you
And everything you do
She'll come alive
She'll come alive for you
And everything you're going through
She'll come
When you've had enough (when you've had enough)
Of what goes around (of what goes around)
Outside your mind (outside your mind)
You know that there's a place for you
Where you can leave it all behind (leave it all behind)
She'll come alive for you
And everything you do (she'll come alive)
She'll come alive for you
And everything you're going through
She'll come alive
You get to the door and then you
Decide that it can't be true
This girl is just too right for me
But while you're out there waiting
And not participating
You are missing her company
She'll come alive for you
And everything you do
She'll come alive
She'll come alive for you
And everything you're going through
She'll come alive
When you've had enough of what goes around outside your mind
You know that there's a place for you where you can leave it all behind
She'll come alive for you and everything you do
She'll come alive
She'll come alive for you and everything you're going through (She'll come alive)
She'll come alive for you and everything you do (She'll come alive)
She'll come alive for you and everything you're going through (She'll come alive)
She'll come alive with you
