Hey Drama Queen, hey Drama Queen
Go on and cry, cry, cry like a baby
Drama Queen, didn't get no beauty rest
Always second best
Well the whole damn thing is just a struggle it's all a mess
Go on and hold your breath and scream
Go on and make us sing
Drama queen
Hey drama queen
Go on and cry, cry, cry
Like a baby drama queen
You poor thing
Ooh, are they in a bunch
Your best friend is a sponge
You'd like to make hot love to me, baby
But you're too afraid to take the plunge
Go on and hold your breath and scream
Go on and make us sing
Drama queen
Hey, drama queen
Go on and cry, cry, cry
Like a baby, cry, cry, cry
Baby take my hand
We'll check your wristband
We'll fix you up shiny and new
Get you ready for the witness stand
Hey Drama Queen
Hey Drama Queen
Go on and cry, cry, cry like a baby
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
