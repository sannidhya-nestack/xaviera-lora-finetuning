Do you remember the days when you said
Nothing gets in your way, ah
You would live for the beat and the music
They were your freeway
Now that's not the case everything's in your way
Time to go back to the old days
Where you felt free, life of the party
Let the music make you happy
It's now time to party, to party and get down like before
It's your time to party, to party and get down like before
It's your time to party, to party and get down like before
It's your time to party, to party and get down like before
You're feeling pressure, it's way too much
No time for your sad, ah
You keep on pushing but it's too much
You're gonna hurt yourself
It's time for a change, can't go on this way
Gotta let go and hit the floor
The music is sweet, feel the wave of relief
As you let go, let the groove save you
It's your time to party, to party and get down like before
It's your time to party, to party and get down like before
It's your time to party, to party and get down like before
It's your time to party, to party and get down like before
It's your time to party, to party and get down like before
It's your time to party, to party and get down like before
It's your time to party, to party and get down like before
It's your time to party, to party and get down like before
And get down like before
And get down like before
And get down like before
And get down like before
