Pack your bags, we're leaving town
No more snowflakes falling down
We need a break from this winter haze
Let's chase the sun and escape the craze
Palm trees swaying, waves crashing high
Sand between our toes on the clear blue sky
No more shivering in the cold
Let's trade our glass for shades of gold
