You made me make me mad
I been with you long days
But don't make me mad
But don't make me mad
You made me make me mad
I been with you long days
But don't make me mad
But don't make me mad
I look down on the road
All my eyes I see
I heard down the road, thought I'd have to see
Gimme my whiskey, gimme my whiskey now
Gimme my whiskey, gimme my whiskey now
Hey, you made me make my man
I been whiskey all day
Woman don't make me mad
Woman don't make me mad
You made me make my man
I been whiskey all day
Woman don't make me mad
Woman don't make me mad
I look down, I look down the road
Farmer, I have to see
I look down the road
Farmer, I have to see
Rain keeps a-fallin' down
I said the rain keeps a-fallin' down
Give me my whiskey
Give me my whiskey now
Hey, you made me meet with me
I been with you all day
But what don't make me mad
But what don't make me mad
You made me make my mind
I been with you all day
But what don't make me mad
But what don't make me mad
You made me make my mind
I been with you all day
But what don't make me mad
But what don't make me mad
You made me make my mind
I been with you all day
But what don't make me mad
But what don't make me mad
