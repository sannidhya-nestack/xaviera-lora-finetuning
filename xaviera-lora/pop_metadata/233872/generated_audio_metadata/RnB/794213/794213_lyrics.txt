I met him at the high school cafeteria
We got to talking and he asked where I was from
I looked at him and said
Somewhere you'd probably be called dead
I looked down by the projects
And he lives high in suburbia (suburbia)
And his parents put me down
They say I'm from the wrong side of town
Well, I live down by the projects
And my friends tell me leave him alone (leave him alone)
But I can't let him go
that boy has made my heart his home
He's got the kind of smile that can light your day
And when he smiles at me I simply melt away
It's not infatuation, I know this love will never stray
But I let down by the projects
And he lives high in suburbia (suburbia)
And his parents put me down
They say I'm from the wrong side of town
I live down by the projects
And my friends tell me leave him alone (leave him alone)
But I can't let him know
that boy has made my heart explode
We're not hurting anyone
So why can't they let us be?
We're just trying to have some fun
We just want to live that American dream
That's all we wanna see if we keep all our light burning bright
Someday this jaded world is gonna see the light
But till that day comes by I've gotta see him on slide
I live down by the projects
And my friends tell me leave him alone
But I can't let him go
that boy has made my heart his own
No, I can't let him go
that boy has made my heart his own
Down by the project, down by the project
I'm just driving by the projects (driving by the projects)
Driving by the projects (can't you see I'm living)
Driving by the projects (can't you see I am living)
