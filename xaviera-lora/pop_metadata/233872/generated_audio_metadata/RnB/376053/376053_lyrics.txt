I just learned that, yeah
I called, I called you up on your phone today
(Why, why, why)
A time on a tradition with you
You never called me anyway
(No) no, no (no, uh)
I called, I called to say that I am sorry
(Sorry babe)
I guess I'm done now with you
I won't let you treat me this way
Leave your name in the book
And I'll get back to you, but you never do, no, no, no
There's no shame, no shame, no surrender
My ass is left there for you, I found someone to love me too, too
I wish you all the best, yeah, I wish you success
You like to be in love like a millionaire
You wanna go for life without a care
Come on baby open your eyes
Come out of the clouds and stop and stare
Did you ever clap with me? Nah
Did you ever take the time to see?
So many times beyond cat in love
There wasn't enough in my account
You chose to fret or wait
I love brewing some foodstuffs today
Leave your name, name, name, number, yeah
And I'll get back to you
But you never do
Oh baby, you never do
There's no shame, no shame, no shame
No surrender
My answers are left there for you
I found someone to love me too
I found someone to love me too
Yeah mate, it's cool.
