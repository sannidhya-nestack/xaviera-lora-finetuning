It woulda been so easy to never get off the couch
It woulda been so easy to call him up and curse him out
It woulda been so easy to scream and fight for ten rounds
But I wanna move on from him
So I gotta be what I've never been
I can't choose the easy way out
It's time to end this pain right now
There's a strength inside that I feel
And I know I'm being rebuilt
It's filling me up (me up)
Giving me love (me love)
Making me better than I was
I chose the high road to
Happiness, it would've been so easy
To curl up in a ball and die
It would've been so easy
To give up and not even try
When he left and didn't need me
I nearly went crazy and lost my mind
But I wanna move on from him
So I gotta be what I've never been
I can't choose the easy way out
It's time to end this pain right now
There's a strength inside that I feel
And I know I'm being rebuilt
It's filling me up (me up)
Giving me love (me love)
Making me better than I was
I chose
I gave my power away to someone else
This had to happen so that I could prove to myself
The strength inside I felt
Was always there to be unveiled
And even though it was a bitter pill
A part of me has been revealed again
I can't choose the easy way out
It's time to end this pain right now
There's a strength inside that I feel
And I know I'm being revealed
It's filling me up, giving me love
Making me better than I was
I chose, yeah I chose
That heart
To happiness, yes happiness is filling me up, giving me love, making me better than I was, yes I chose the heart
It shows the high roads to happiness
And now it is so easy
To look back and give it all thanks
Yeah it is so easy
No matter what I will be okay
Ooh, it's filling me up (me up) giving me love (me love) making me better than I was
I chose the high road to happiness
Oh, ooh
