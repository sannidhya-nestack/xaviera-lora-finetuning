Some people wanna take it slow
I'm gonna rock it all night though
I'm gonna let my head down low
Down to the floor
You know it's sweet, you know it's sticky
Mmm, it's tasty and it's sticky
A little fizzy, a little tingly
Are you with me?
Raspberry, chocolatini
Hot bikini, I stay steamy
Little cocktail in my hand
Yeah, I got it on demand
Take a dip, let me get you wet
Drip drip let me make you sweat
Yeah you can get it any way you want
Any way you want
Shake and not stir
Pinky out make'em slur
Ooh yeah now it's my turn
When I do it I make it burn
Raspberry
Chocolatini
Hot bikini
I stay steamy
Little cocktail in my hand
Yeah I got it on demand
Slide it over let it splash
Velvet kisses midnight flash
In velvet scenes, dancing through our sugar dreams
So sip it slow or chug it fast, this kind of love is built to last
Raspberry lips are chocolate teas, come on baby drink up the breeze
Raspberry Chocolatini
Come on baby I'm so dreamy
Raspberry Chocolatini
Come on baby I'm so dreamy
Raspberry Chocolatini
Oh baby, I'm so dreamy
