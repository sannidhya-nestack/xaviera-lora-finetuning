The girl I wanna be
The girl I wanna be
She is working in a bar serving drinks for others
Waiting for time to go, oh, oh
In her dreams she is a famous movie star
Waiting for time to glow
But every time I say no
Sorry girl but I have to tell you
That you're not the type of girl we need
You see that both of them
Like a girl you're gonna have to be
She's thinking she is the girl I wanna be
The girl I'm gonna be
The girl you're gonna see
This time I'm gonna make it they say
I'm not ready for it one day
I'm gonna show him she is the girl they wanna see
The girl I wanna be
The girl I wanna be
She is working overtime just to make a living
Tired from head to toe
In her dreams she is a singing superstar
She's outstanding in her show
But every time I say no
Sorry girl but I have to tell you that you're not the type of girl we need
You see that poster there, that's the girl you're gonna have to be
And she's thinking she is the girl I wanna be
The girl I'm gonna be
The girl you're gonna see
I'm gonna make it, they say
I'm not ready for it one day
I'm gonna show her she is the girl they wanna see
The girl I wanna be
What about the skills?
Got it
What about the will?
Got it
I really wanna be among the stars
So what about the acts?
Got it
And what about the sex?
Got it
Can't you see it's written in the cards, oh
The girl I wanna be
She's thinking she is the girl I wanna be
The girl I'm gonna be (girl I wanna be)
The girl you're gonna see
This time I'm gonna make it, they say
I'm not ready for it, one day
I'm gonna show him she is the girl they wanna see (girl I wanna be)
She is the girl I wanna be
The girl I'm gonna be
The girl you're gonna see
I'm gonna make it, they say
I'm not ready for it, one day
I'm gonna show'em she is
The girl they wanna see
The girl I wanna be
The girl I wanna be
Yeah
