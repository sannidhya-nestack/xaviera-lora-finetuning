Beneath the city lights
Our hearts beat in rhythmic vibes
Your touch is a melody
Whispering in the silent night
Sometimes it feels like a dream
Lost in your gaze it's a thrill
With every moment we steal
Every wish to fulfill
Lost in the echoes of love
Painted in shades of blue
In the rhythm of the night
Lost in the soul with you
And we sway
Like the many of waves
Crashing gently through
To the rhythm of our love swaying under the moon's bamboo, bamboo
Your whispers warm as sunshine
Your souls glow out shines the dawn
In your rhythm I find mine
The symphony never gone
We dance on the stars reflection
With the world slowing down
In your arms each direction
A harmony without a sound
Lost in the echoes of love
Painted in shades of blue
In the rhythm of the night
I'm lost in the soaring
And we sway, and we sway
Like the melody of waves (like the melody of waves)
Crashing gently through (crashing gently through)
To the rhythm of our love (our love)
Swaying under the moon's bamboo (bamboo)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Our love story came in a mood like you, like you (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Through the ages it remains forever and ever
It's just me and you and you (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And we sway, and we sway, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Remember all the stories, hated it, who finds you?
Through the ages it remains forever in our hearts
