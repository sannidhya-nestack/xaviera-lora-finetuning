You had my heart the first time you smiled at me
Now you're keeping me up
dreaming's got nothing on reality
Ooh, but I can't resist the taste of your kiss
And no, nothing can keep us apart
And that look in your eyes got me so hypnotized
As you fall into my arms
But you keep me coming back for more
Whatever the weather
When it rains, it pours
We'll be together forever
I never, never, never get enough of your love
Well, that's an open door
And you keep me coming back for more, more, more, more, more, more
Now here we are, stronger than the world thought we'd be
We're so much deeper in love
Cause we rose above all the negativity
Ooh a couple of fools breaking all of the rules
Yeah they said we were moving too fast
And that love after sight is fine for one night
But they said we'd never last
But you keep me coming back for more
Whatever the weather
And baby when it rains it pours
We'll be together forever
I never, never, never get enough of your love
Well there's an open door
And you keep me coming back for more
More, more, more, more, more, more
Never never never never never never
Oh, a couple of fools breaking all the rules
Yeah, they said we were moving too fast
And that love at first sight is fine for one night
But they said we would never last
Oh, but you keep me coming back for more
Whatever the weather, baby, when it rains it pours
We'll be together forever
I never, never, never get enough of your love
Well, there's an open door
And you keep me coming back for more
But you keep me coming back for more
Whatever the weather
And baby when it rains it pours
We'll be together forever
I never never never get enough of your love
Well that's an open door
And you keep me coming back for more
