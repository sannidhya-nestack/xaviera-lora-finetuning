But it's the beginning and it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter
If the first shot of a story turns out
To be completely unrelated
So here we are with vanilla in the air
Vanilla in our glasses
And vanilla in our minds
The second shot is only needed in the story
To let characters wait for one of them to break the silence
Break the silence, break the silence
If you think
Though there's no need
Oh, and if you think
Though there's no need
And if you think I'm not telling y'all
I'll let you try from my glance to understand
And from this song this cool vanilla is all you'll have
And if you think I'm not telling y'all
I'll let you try from my glance to understand
Oh there's no need to live in any story after all
And if you think I'm not telling you
I'll let you try for my glass, do I understand?
And from this song, this full vanilla is all you had
The night is getting dark and no one's gonna move
My glass is empty and I'm the star
Need to know what's going on (Body's a big diggin' head)
Rock, baby, my glass is down (Never mind the NBC)
And there's no need to talk (It's better when you're gone)
Rock, baby, just another trip for me (Never mind the NBC)
If we move on
For just another trip, I'll leave
There's no end of this
And you've probably noticed
There's no end of this
And you've probably noticed
If you think I'm not telling y'all, I'll let you try from my class to understand
Though there's no need to live in any story after all
And if you think I'm not telling y'all,
I'll let you try from my class to understand
And from this song, this full vanilla is all you'll have
And if you think I'm not telling you (And if you think, and if you think)
This cool vanilla's all you'll have after all (And if you think)
I'm not telling you (From this song)
This cool vanilla's all you'll have (It's all you'll have)
It's all you'll have
And if you think I'm not telling ya
And if you think I'm not telling y'all
I'll let you try for my class to understand
Oh there's no need to live in any story after all
And if you think I'm not telling y'all
I'll let you try for my class to understand
And from this song this full vanilla is all you'll have
And if you think I'm not telling y'all
I'll let you try for my class to understand
Oh there's no need to live in any story
This story
This fool vanilla
This story
