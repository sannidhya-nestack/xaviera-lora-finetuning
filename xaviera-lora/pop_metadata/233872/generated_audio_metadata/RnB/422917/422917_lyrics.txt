If I was a bird, I'd sing the sweetest songs to you
if this life is asleep, you're a dream come true
This wasn't the plan
You were just supposed to peek in my heart's window
But you opened the door and
Took all my heart strings with you
And I wanna be with you
Of everything you do girl don't change and stay right there
From the sound of your voice to how you wear your hair
The way you talk to me it just make me wanna sing
To you, you
But hold on, this wasn't the plan
You were just supposed to peek in my heart's window
But you opened the door and
Took all my heart strings with you
And I wanna be with you (oh, ah)
the way you walk (move it, babe)
And the way you talk (so sexy, babe)
But the way you move (do it, babe)
I just wanna sing to you
Say this verse to you
Of everything you do, girl, don't try to stay right there
From the sound of your voice to how you move your head
The way you talk to me, it just makes me wanna sing
To who? To you, you
'Cause if I was a bird, I'd sing to you
Oh, oh, oh
