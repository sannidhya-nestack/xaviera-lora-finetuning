I take my hat and my coat with me
Just in case it starts to rain
I take my old sweet time when the ride race gets insane
Yeah, I take what I can, darling,'til I get enough
But you can keep my heart with you
Just in case you're in love
I had a crazy dream last night
Not an hour before dawn
I could've sworn I saw you lying on the lawn
You said you'll lose everything you own when the game gets rough, oh yeah
But you can keep my heart with you just in case you're in love
Oh, I keep my love memories with me in case I et
What it feels like to be
Dropped out of a jet
Without a parachute that is
Yeah, I take what I can darling
Till I get enough
But you can keep my heart with you
Just in case you're in love
Oh, I keep my soul close by me
In case the devil ets
How he tried a couple times but he
Still ain't got it yet
At least I don't think you've got it
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, take what I need, darling
Just ignore that other stuff, yeah
So you can keep my heart with you
Just in case you're in love
Yeah, you can keep my heart with you
Just in case you're in love
Yeah, just in case you're in love, yeah
