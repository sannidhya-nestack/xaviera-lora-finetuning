Come on, come on, get with it
Let's meet a while later
Somebody might be watching
Can't talk to you now
You been starting something
Can I get your number
I'll call you in a while
You're not gonna wait long
I like your style
For now let's pretend that we haven't done a thing
No, I feel a smile growing, nose growing, nobody means
Nobody knows
Do you wanna get with it?
Do you wanna get busy?
Do you think it's okay if we could get dangerous?
Do you wanna get with it?
Do you wanna get busy?
Let's have a little rendezvous
You and me in our safety place
When I'm looking at you
Every look lasts longer
Can you feel you're gonna touch me?
My body feels stronger
You don't have to wonder
What's going on in our minds
Can we take it together
Just one more time
But now just a touch
Emotions come alive
The first kiss
Give me a rush inside
What a rush
Do you wanna get with it
Do you wanna get busy
Do you wanna
Do you think it's okay
If we could get dangerous
Do you wanna get with it
Come on girl
Do you wanna get busy
Let's have a little rendezvous
You and me in our secret place
Do you wanna get with it? (Do you wanna?)
Do you wanna get busy?
Do you think it's okay if we could get dangerous? (Do you wanna?)
Do you wanna get with it? (Do you wanna?)
Do you wanna get busy? (Wanna get busy?)
Let's have a little rendezvous
You and me in our secret place
That can be an explosion (that can be an explosion)
Yeah, yeah, baby (that can be an explosion)
That can be an explosion (that can be an explosion)
Second to none, second to none
I'm waiting for you, baby (I'm waiting for you, baby)
Waiting for you, baby (you gotta get some)
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta get some
Do you wanna get?
Do you wanna get with it? Do you wanna get busy?
Let's have a little rendezvous, you and me in our secret place
Do you wanna get with it? Do you wanna get busy?
Do you wanna get with it? Do you wanna be with me in our secret place
Do you wanna get busy? Let's have a little rendezvous, you and I in our secret place
Do you wanna get with it?
There could be something significant to know (If it's okay, if we could get dangerous)
(Do you wanna get with it?) (You gotta know, you gotta, gotta, gotta get it)
