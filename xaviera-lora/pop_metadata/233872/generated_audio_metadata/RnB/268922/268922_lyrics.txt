You are the crawl in my awe
You are the catch in my snatch
You are the pain in the middle
You give me sweetheart attacks
You are the kiss on my lips
You make my bread bag to rise
And when you're so far away
You should come as no surprise
It's raining inside
I wanna hide
You are the breath that I breathe
You are the fall to my leaves
You are the sun in my sky
You are my drug make me high
I guess I should take a tip (do, do)
And try to leave you alone (do, do)
But when you touch me in places
You make me wanna stay home
It's raining inside
I wanna hide
When you're far away inside I die
All love is what you're serving up
Makes me want another bite
The heaping harvest I crave
Fills my taste buds with delight
We'll sit and stir for my chore
Odd kisses all on your face
In those places we don't talk about
You are the swing in my song
You are the lick on my tongue
With your sweet lips on my body
It calls my fingers to run
I need to lie but I can't
Is it just me or feel hot?
For you I'd crawl through a fire
So I could snack on your spot
There's a maiden inside
I wanna hide
When you're far away
I wanna run out and scream your name
The kisses are haunting
I can taste them in the air
(Taste them in the air) taste it, the kiss consume me
Oh don't you tease me right there
I like to saddle my emotions
But I'd rather saddle you
And take my sweet time just to love you
Oh, it's raining inside of me
I got to have your sweet touches all over my body
I want you inside of me, my pretty baby
It's raining inside, I wanna hide
When you're far away, inside I die
