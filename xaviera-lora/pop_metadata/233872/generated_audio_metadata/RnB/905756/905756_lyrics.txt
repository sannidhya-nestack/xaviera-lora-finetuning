Got too many mutuals
Seeing you out when I have my drink
There you are as usual
And you won't let me do my thing
I see you feeling volatile
But I don't even wanna feel you
Even from a mile away, mile away, mile away
This is my day
You always got a mouthful, a mouthful, a mouthful
Telling all my friends we split
But I don't need a council, no council, council
You gotta let the break set in
I know that you know that I know when we fall
Tryin' not to think about it
And you know that I know that you know when we fall
And tryin' not to think about it
Won't you find a new spot to kick it?
baby this train ran out of love
Looking for a new thing to hit it
It's gonna take more than a drink or a drug
It's gonna take a chainsaw
A chainsaw, chainsaw
To try to cut me where it hurts
Cause baby I'm an outlaw
An outlaw, an outlaw
You'll never hurt me with your words, no
I know that you know that I know when we fall
Tryin' not to think about it
And you know that I know that you know when we fall
Tryin' not to think about it
La la la la, la la la la
It's gonna take a chainsaw, a chainsaw, a chainsaw
To try to cut me where it hurts
baby I'm an outlaw, an outlaw, an outlaw
You'll never hurt me with your words
I know that you know that I know when we fall
Tryin' not to think about it
And you know that I know that you know when we fall
Tryin' not to think about it
