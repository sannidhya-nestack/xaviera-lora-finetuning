Yeah, uh, seen her at the club around eleven thirty
One look, two looks, the rest was getting dirty
We had a little convo and it went like this
Hey, my name is Curtis, you wanna dance?
Yes was her answer (yeah) we partied there (after) (oh) we exchanged numbers, I promised I would call her
We set a date for Sunday, designated fun day
From that point on my mind was thinking one way (girl you're on my mind)
All the time and I'm glad to know
That you are mine, girl you're on my mind
All the time and I'm glad to know
That you are mine, girl you're on my mind
All the time and I'm glad to know
That you are mine, girl you're on my mind
All the time and I'm glad to know
Now every day's a fun day, the nights are even wilder
We may ride around town or make love in the shower
She's my friend and I'm her buddy
Her kids are super cool and she knows my boy loves me
Relationship is cool, there's no pressure, just good
Damn, I think I love her
It's my third time, so I better slow it down
But it's hard when she's constantly on my mind
Girl, you're on my mind all the time
And I'm glad to know that you are mine
Girl, you're on my mind all the time
And I'm glad to know that you are mine
Girl, you're on my mind
All the time and I'm glad to know (all my mind) that you are mine (all the time) till you're on my mind (my mind)
All the time and I'm glad to know (all my mind) that you are mine (all my mind) you are mine (all my mind) you are mine (all my mind) you are mine (all my mind) you are mine (all my mind) you are mine (all my mind)
My mind
I'm on my mind
