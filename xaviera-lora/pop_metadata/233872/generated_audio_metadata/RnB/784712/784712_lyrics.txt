They all want to surrender
That's the danger of living inside of a cage
Everybody's just a stranger to the nature world
Maybe you think you are free in sunny California
But baby, wake up
We live in the fire
We don't have a home
Everybody else is got it all wrong
We live in the fire
We don't have a home
I remember, that's the danger
Now love is behind everything
It's a shame to see
The man et about
The nature world
Oh maybe you think
You are rich
On your private beach
Oh baby wake up
We live in the fire, we don't have a home
Everybody else is got it all wrong
We live in the fire, we don't have home
It's hard to see, it's misunderstood
We've never had a clue of harmony
We live in the fire, we don't have a home
Everybody else is getting on it wrong
We live in the fire, we don't have a home
In the nature world
Still I love the danger road
