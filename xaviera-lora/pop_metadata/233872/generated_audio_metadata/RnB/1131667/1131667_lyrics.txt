Trembling, air feels like October skies
Fumbling, lost all track of space and time
And I know how things must seem
So fragile in our shells
And it's not so binary
How we journey to ourselves
So how can I help
Watching the clouds pass through
No clue of the time
No reason to be so doomed
We hold on the skies for the first time
We draw the lines just right in between
I'm tracing you
Pause myself, hold my breath before I die
Like jellyfish beneath the surface
The sparks that make us thrive
And I see the never ending shoreline
But now I'm not alone
It's funny how sometimes
We need to lose our way to find our home
And it's not so binary
How we journey to ourselves
So how can I help
Watching the clouds pass through
No clue of the time
No reason to be so due
We hold on the skies for the first time
We draw the lines
Just read in between
I'm tracing you
Hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Pause myself
Hold my breath before I die
So how can I help
Watching the clouds pass through
No clue of the time
No reason to be so doomed
