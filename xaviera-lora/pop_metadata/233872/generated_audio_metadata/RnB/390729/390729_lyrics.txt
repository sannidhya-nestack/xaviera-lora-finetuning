Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, baby wants whatever she sees
And my baby gets what she needs from me
Baby, baby wants whatever she feels
And my baby gets what she needs, yeah
Some people living just for themselves
That use you for a while
Then land you back on the shelf
I ain't no sinner and I ain't no saint
But when push comes to shove
There won't be no complaints because
Baby, baby wants whatever she sees
And my baby gets what she needs from me
Baby, baby wants whatever she feels
Then my baby gets what she needs, period
Well, I don't diss the rich and I don't diss the poor
And I know one man's ceiling is another man's floor
My baby's not helpless, maybe out of control
But when she crosses my bridge, I will pay for the toll
Baby, baby wants whatever she sees
And my baby gets what she needs from me
Baby, baby wants whatever she feels
Then my baby gets what she needs, baby
By some good fortune you might fall into fame
Change your phone number and then change your name
There are some others who might not understand
Why if you're my lady then I'll be your man
They believe it won't last
And my baby gets whatever my baby wants, whatever my baby needs
Whatever my girl I give my baby, what she wants she gets
Oh, baby, baby, keep on giving, baby, just keep on giving you all I can, girl, you know I really want to be
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, baby wants whatever she sees
Then my baby gets what she needs from me
Baby, baby wants whatever she sees
Then my baby gets what she needs from me
Baby, baby wants whatever she sees
And my baby gets what she needs from me
Baby baby wants whatever she sees
Then my baby gets what she needs from me
Baby baby wants whatever she sees
And my baby gets what she needs from me
