Trying to convince me you'll change
You're so damn insecure (so damn insecure)
That you can't move on because you're afraid
I can't do this anymore
We keep going around and around and around
We disagree so then I leave and it's all set for fight
When you call me I start to scream cause we both think we're right
So here we are again right back where we began
And I don't wanna keep going back and forth (back and forth)
And I don't wanna keep going back and forth
When you call me late at night
Saying to me that you're so sorry
But still trying to justify
All the reasons why you got so angry
I can do this once or twice
But it's getting too familiar
I want your drama out of my life
I don't wanna keep going round
And round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round And you set me so that I'm even but so simplified (I disagree) When you call me, we start to scream'cause we both think we're right (Right) So here we are again, right back where we began (Oh) And I don't wanna keep going back and forth (Oh) And I don't wanna keep going back and forth (Oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause maybe in another life
You and I can do all the same
But baby until then
We gotta let this thing end here
I don't really want you to go
But boy you know I can't stay
I don't wanna keep going back and forth
Doing all the same things baby
I don't wanna keep going back and forth
Doing all the same things, baby
And I don't wanna keep going back and forth
I don't wanna keep going back
And I don't wanna keep going back and forth
And I don't wanna keep going back and forth
And I don't wanna keep going back and forth (I don't wanna keep going back and forth)
I don't wanna keep doing this anymore
