Everybody's talking, talking'bout you baby
Talking'bout the way you walk
Some people say I'm crazy, I'm wet down my mind
you're constantly in my thoughts
Moving like you do
Steady as she goes
Can give a man chills
And even curl his toes
Her mind's made up
She's going out tonight
She's got her high heels on
She know the time it's right now
The girl is loose
She's cutting loose
Here's the living roof
The girl is wild
Sexy sexy baby
She's my sweet love child
Gonna take her time, get her hair just right
Put a lipstick on and build it light
She lights a fire in my eyes, do it to me every time
She's ready, couldn't wait for the night
Move it like you do
Steady as she goes
She'll give'em angels
And even girlies too
Worked hard all week
Did what she was told
She did this, she did that
Now it's time to get bold
Girl is loose
She's cutting loose
It's the living proof
The girl is wild, sexy, sexy, baby
She's my sweet love child
Girl is loose, she's cutting loose
It's not an empty roof
The girl is wild, sexy, sexy, baby
She's my sweet love child
Look like that, made me swing, swing it, swing it
Can I give you love again, I like the way you move
You're walking, talking, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Just swing it down, work that body
Give me love, ooh, ooh
She look kinda cute, tight boots and a sweater
Gonna work that girl for sure, it'll make her feel better
She sweet, let me see you move those feet
Rock to the beat, head to the car
Know where we goin', to the backseat
Move it like you do
Steady as she goes
Can't believe a man chills
And even count his toes
Her mind's made up
She's going out tonight
She's got her high heels on
So you know the time is right now
Girl it's loose
You're looking good to me
It's the living proof
The girl is wild, sexy, sexy, baby
She's my sweet love child, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
The girl is loose, yeah, she's got you loose
Here's the lifted roof, come on
The girl is wild, sexy, sexy, baby
She's my sweet love child
