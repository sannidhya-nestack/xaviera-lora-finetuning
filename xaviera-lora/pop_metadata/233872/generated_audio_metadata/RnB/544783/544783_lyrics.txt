Since I've been loving you
I can't ever get no sleep
You broke into my heart and baby you
You're a secret I just can't keep
Since I've been loving you
I lie awake most every night, yes I do
I'm thinking about what you're doing to me baby
You're loving me, oh so right
You've got me tied up, I can't think, I can't eat
Like having a sickness with no remedy
The only thing left for me now
Is to keep loving you
Since I've been loving you, yeah
My friends wonder what's going on
They ain't seen me in a week or two
And I know they're thinking something so wrong
But since I've been loving you
I can't think about nothing else
I'm happy just to fantasize
About having you all to myself
I'll do what I've got to, to be by your side
I don't give a damn, I can swallow my pride
The only thing left for me now
Is to keep loving you
Since I've been loving you
Since I
Been loving you (since I've been loving you)
Baby since I've been loving you
Since I've been loving you
