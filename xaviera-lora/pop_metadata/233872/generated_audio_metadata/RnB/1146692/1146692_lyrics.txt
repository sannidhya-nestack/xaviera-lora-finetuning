Sitting by the corner
So hard to get over this dream
I live in so much pain and misery
And yet had such a beautiful dream
I wish I could make this real
Oh if I can go back to the stream
I would a thousand times
A day so sweet
Is sweeter than reality
I love to live in this dream
I love to live in this dream
Ooh ooh ooh
I love to live in this dream
Oh, what a wonderful day
I never thought of this
I never thought of this
Oh, what a wonderful day
I never thought of this, I never thought of this
I put on my shoes and my clothes, stepped out it's daytime
Then I picked the list of my cars, oh
I drove up to a beautiful place I used to see in the magazines
Had meetings with bosses and the respect is so intense
Oh what a wonderful day (wonderful day)
I never thought of this (oh) I never thought of this
Oh, what a wonderful day
I never thought of this
I never thought of this
It was a dream and I pray it comes alive
From this dream I can tell my future is yearning for me
It was a dream and I pray it comes alive
From this dream I can tell my future is yearning for me
Oh, what a wonderful day
I never thought of this
I never thought of this
Oh, what a wonderful day
I never thought of this
I never thought of this
