Stars are bright in the sky
I'm looking at you tonight
Underneath the moon's glow
There's nowhere else we go
Dancing in the summer breeze
Whispering secrets with ease
Your laughter lights up the dark
Sparks fly like a shooting star
Ooh, it's a fine night to be with you
Everything feels so brand new
Hold my hand let's take a ride
With you always by my side
Oh it's a fine night to be with you
City lights fade away
As we find our secret place
Laughing'til the break of dawn
Together we can't go wrong
Silhouettes against the moon
We don't need nothing more
Every moment's like a dream
With you life's a perfect scene
Oh, it's a fine night to be with you
Everything feels so brand new
Hold my hand, let's take a ride
With you always by my side
Oh, it's a fine night to be with you
Silhouettes fade away
As we find our secret place
Laughing'til the break of dawn
Together we can't go wrong
Silhouettes against the moon
We don't need nothing more
Every moment's like a dream
With you life's a perfect scene
Oh it's a fine night to be with you
Everything feels so brand new
Hold my hand let's take a ride
With you always by my side
Oh it's a fine night to be with you
With you, with you
I'll be with you, with you
I'll be with you, with you
I'll be with you, with you
