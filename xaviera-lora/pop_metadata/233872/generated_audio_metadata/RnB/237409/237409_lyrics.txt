You tell me I'm beautiful
And then you say you love my smile
You tell me everything I wanna hear
But I'm petrified of falling for you
you got me breaking all the rules
What's a girl to do when she can't love you?
I thought it was through, I thought I was through
Don't tell me you love me
'Cause I need to hear it
And don't say sweet things to me
That I wanna hear
Don't tell me you need me
I need to hear it
Don't tell me you love me
Until you mean it
Just don't tell me you love me
Wake up thinking about you
But I'm so afraid to admit how I feel about you
Can I trust ya? Can I love ya? I know
You can't promise to be there for me
You can't promise to always love me
Can you promise not to hurt me?
Don't tell me you love me
'Cause I need to hear it
And don't say sweet things to me
That I wanna hear
Don't tell me you need me
I need to hear it
Don't tell me you love me
Until you mean it
Just don't tell me you love me
I see myself falling
You've got me, so call me
Your words have got me weak
I know that I feel it, I love you
But I don't know if you mean it
I wanna know that I can trust you
But I'd rather you just don't tell me you love me
'Cause I need to hear it
And don't say sweet things to me
That I wanna hear
Don't tell me you need me
I need to hear it
Don't tell me you love me
Until you mean it
Just don't tell me you love me
