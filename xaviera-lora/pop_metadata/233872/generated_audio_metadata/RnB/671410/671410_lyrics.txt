Done, done, she'd rather be alone than face the weather
There, there, the people buy and multiply and lie
She never wanted to, never wanted to
Fall in line like the rest of them
Drawn to the light
She never wanted to, never wanted to
Move the same just the rest of them go their way
Say, say that if you wanna go, we'll go together
Oh, and we'll be, be a few, we'll follow no one to make it through
She never wanted to, never wanted to
Fall in line like the rest of them, drawn to the light
She never wanted to, never wanted to
Move the same, just the rest of them go their way
Oh, oh, she never wanted to, never wanted to
Fall in line like the rest of them drawn to the light
She never wanted to, never wanted to
Move the same just the rest of them go
She never wanted to, never wanted to
Fall in line like the rest of them
Drawn to the light
Never wanted to move the same
Just the rest of them go
Just the rest of them go
Just the rest of them go away
