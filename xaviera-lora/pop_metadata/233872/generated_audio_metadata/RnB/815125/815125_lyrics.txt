Somewhere out there
Waits my life
Somewhere out there
Waits my love
Only I can't see, so I know not where to search
Only I can't read the story that is told
Somewhere out there
Waits my dream
Somewhere out there
Waits my song
Only I can't see
Though I know not where to search
Only I can't read
The story that is told
Somewhere in here, oh it's my life
