My love was dedicated but then it faded
The way that you played it how can I call you friend
And every time you come knocking I let you know
Talking so ready to break my heart again
From the window to the wall
Till the sweat drips down my face
I'm like an addict going through withdrawals
Gotta get you out of my veins
Who do you think you are?
Playing in my bed
Creeping with my heart
Who gave you the key?
Now you wanna leave
You dirty little thief
You play with my heart
You play with me
You play with my heart
You play with me, eh
You play with my heart
You play with me
You gon' regret it
You gon' regret it
I swear you look the coldest I ever noticed
You probably enjoy it, yes I know you do
I put my heart out on my sleeve and you came and you ate it ate it
You must have an appetite for fools
From the window to the wall
Till the sweat drips down my face
I'm like an addict going through withdrawals
Gotta get you out of my veins
Who do you think you are?
Playing in my bed, deep in with my heart
Who gave you that key? Now you walk that leaf
You dirty little thief, thief, thief, damn
Play with my heart, you play with me
You play with my heart, you play with me, eh
You play with my heart, you play with me
You gon' regret it, you gon' regret it
Baby, baby, my heart tells me more than friends
Oh babe, just send me, all of me
I'm tired of waiting
Baby don't break me
My heart can't take no more it's fragile
I would give you my life
But who do you think you are?
Playing in my bed, creeping with my heart
Who gave you the key?
Now you wanna leave, you dirty little thief, baby
Who do you think you are?
Playing in my bed, creeping with my heart
Who gave you the key?
Now you wanna leave, you dirty little thief
You played with my heart, you played with me
You played with my heart, you played with me
You played with my heart, you played with me
You gon' regret it, you gon' regret it
Don't you et it
