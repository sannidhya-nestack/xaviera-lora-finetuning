Looking back life was alright
Guess it never felt quite right
Till I met you and I found love
Felt a change it was on the way
Guess it happened on the day I met you and I found love
Everyday I'm feeling stronger loving you
Feeling stronger now baby
All the times that we have shared
All the times that we've shared now
Can't imagine ever living without you
Where would I be? (Where would I be now?)
What would I do? (What would I do?)
I just wanna say thank you (I just wanna say thank you)
So lucky that I found you (you)
What would I do without you? (Oh yeah)
I just wanna say thank you (I just wanna say thank you)
What would I do without you
Looking back life was okay
There again not quite the way I planned
Till I had you
I was always wanting more
Looking out for an open door
And I had you
Everyday I'm feeling stronger loving you (feeling stronger now baby)
All the times that we have shared (all the times that we have shared now)
Can't imagine ever being without you
Where would I be? (Where would I be now?)
What would I do? (What would I do?)
I just wanna say thank you (I just wanna say thank you)
So lucky that I found you (ooh)
What would I do without you? (oh yeah)
I just wanna say thank you (I just wanna say thank you)
What would I do without you? (Oh yeah)
And all those tears and lost emotions (the tears)
I could've spent my time with you (my time with you)
Now I find myself with everything I need
And I've realized I will never lose
I just wanna say thank you (just wanna say thank you)
So lucky that I found you
What would I do without you? (oh yeah)
I just wanna say thank you (just wanna say thank you)
So lucky that I found you
What would I do without you? (oh yeah)
I just wanna say thank you (just wanna say thank you)
So lucky that I found you
What would I do without you? (oh yeah!)
I just wanna say thank you (just wanna say thank you)
So lucky that I found you
What would I do without you?
