Lost control, running on a wheel, going nowhere
Lost my cool, no direction, nothing out there
So confused, with no clue, what's the answer?
Let's go back to the way things were
When everything was so simple
Have a drink, have a joke, put your hands up
Mouths, mouths to the groove, throw your hands up
So I closed my eyes
Think of the days when it was all so different
Let's go back to the way things were
When everything was so simple
Have a drink, have a joke, put your hands up
Bounce, bounce to the groove, throw your hands up
Lost control, running on a wheel, going nowhere
Lost my cool, no direction, nothing out there
So confused, with no clue, what's the answer
And I say oh no
'Cause I don't know why
And I say oh no
Let's go back to the way things were
When everything was so simple
Have a drink, have a joke, put your hands up
Bounce, bounce to the groove, throw your hands up
So I closed my eyes
Think of the days when it was all so different
Let's go back to the way things were
When everything was so simple
Have a drink, have a joke, put your hands up
Bounce, bounce to the groove, throw your hands up
Let's go back to the way things were
When everything was so simple
Have a drink, have a joke, put your hands up
Mouths, mouths to the groove, throw your hands up
Let's go back to the way things were
When everything was so simple
Have a drink, have a joke, put your hands up
Mouths, mouths to the groove, throw your hands up
And I say oh no
'Cause I don't know why
And I say oh no
