Knock me down
You told me that I wasn't good enough
You never thought that I would call your bluff
Now I laugh at every time you said
You ain't worth nothing
I tried and failed for five long years
Cried all night but no one there to wipe my tears
And you promised me all your love
But you never gave nothing
Sick of all the drama
Tired of all the fights
Never going back,'cause it don't feel right
I'm a broken girl, I'm a broken girl
I'm a broken girl and I don't wanna be put back together
I'm a broken girl, I'm a broken girl
I'm a broken girl but I can find someone to treat me better
Your healing touch was just an empty con
You only wanted me to turn you on
Asked for everything that I had
But you never gave nothing
Now I know that I should be myself
And not be defined by someone else
Build me up then you knock me down
Thanks for nothing
Sick of all the drama
Tired of all the fights
Never going back
Cause it's too dark, we'll be alright
I'm a broken girl
I'm a broken girl
I'm a broken girl and I don't wanna be put back together, oh
I'm a broken girl, I'm a broken girl
I'm a broken girl and I can find someone to treat me better (treat me better)
Ooh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm a broken girl
I'm a broken girl
I'm a broken girl and I don't wanna be pulled back together
I'm a broken girl (broken girl)
I'm a broken girl
I'm a broken girl and I don't wanna be pulled back to get love
I'm a broken girl (I'm a broken girl)
I'm a broken girl (I'm a broken girl)
I'm a broken girl but I can find someone to treat me better
I'm a broken girl
I'm a broken girl
I'm a broken girl
And I don't wanna be putting things together
I'm a broken girl, I'm a broken girl
I'm a broken girl but I can find someone to treat me better
