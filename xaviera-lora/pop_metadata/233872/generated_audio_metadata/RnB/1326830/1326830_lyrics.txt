Some people wanna take it slow
I'm gonna rock it all night though
I'm gonna let my hair down low, down to the floor
You know it's sweet, you know it's sticky
Mmm, it's tasty and it's sticky
A little fizzy, a little tingly
Are you with me?
Raspberry chocolatini, hot bikini, I stay steamy
Little cocktail in my hand, yeah I got it on demand
Take a dip, let me get you wet
Drip drip, let me make you sweat
Yeah you can get it any way you want
Any way you want
Shakin' I'll stir
Pinky I'll make'em slur
Ooh yeah now it's my turn
When I do it I make it burn
Raspberry chocolatini
Hot bikini I stay steamy
Little cocktail in my hand
Yeah I got it on demand
Slide it over, let it splash
Velvet kisses, midnight flash
You and me in velvet scenes
Dancing through our sugar dreams
So sip it slow or chug it fast this kind of love is built to last
Raspberry lips or chocolate teas come on baby drink up the breeze
Raspberry Chocolatini
Come on baby I'm so dreamy
Raspberry Chocolatini
Come on baby I'm so dreamy
Raspberry Chocolatini
Come on baby I'm so dreamy
But underneath the sugar high
There's a part of me that wonders why
I chase the thrill to hide the ache
Pour in dreams I didn't make
I stir the glass I watch it spin
Hoping love is somewhere in
This candy coated masquerade
I just wanna feel not fade away
Raspberry chocolatini
Come on baby I'm so dreamy
Raspberry chocolatini
Come on baby I'm so dreamy
Raspberry chocolatini
Come on baby I'm so dreamy
