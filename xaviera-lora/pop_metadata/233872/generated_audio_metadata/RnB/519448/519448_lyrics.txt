Nobody's right, nobody's wrong with no hesitation
I'll be the first to give in
'Cause I'd rather be wrong than dead right in this situation
But without you I can't go on living
I think we can make it alright
Yeah we can make it
I don't ever wanna lose you
I know we can make it
I know we're gonna make it
Make it alright
So let's start making it right
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
Three easy words, so hard to say
But let me try to say them
I was wrong (that wasn't so hard)
This is absurd to go on this way
So let's stop this mayhem right now and
Our love will grow stronger
So come on we can make it
We gon' keep on pushin' pressin' on (I think we can make it)
I know baby we can make it happen
I think we can make it (I know we can)
I know we can make it happen
I think we can make it (I think we can make it)
Can we try just one more time I think we will make it
I know I know I know I know we gonna make it
Make it happen
I still think we can make it happen, make it happen, make it happen, make it happen
On second thought I don't think I know that I know that
We can make it happen, make it happen, make it happen, make it happen
Let's make it happen right now
I think we can make it
Girl, I know we gonna make it (make it alright)
Let's start making it right, right now
Right now, right now, right now
I think we can make it
Let's start making it right, right now
Right now, right now, right now
I think we can make it
Think we can make it
Let's start making it right
We can make it
Think we can make it
