There will never be anyone quite like you
Baby when you're down just call and I'll be there
Open your heart to see me
You will learn to feel with your eyes
Baby don't be surprised if it's you I'm thinking
I'll always be by your side
When times get rough
Oh yeah, you seem so far away (so far away)
So far away
Oh baby, you are so far away
So far away
Baby take my hand and you'll find that I love you
Love you'til days and all nights are gone
Now if you believe what I say is true
Baby when I say that I love you
That's forever all my life
I'll always be by your side
I want your love
Oh baby, you're so far away (so far away)
So far away
Baby, you are so far away
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, I'm thinking of
I'll always be by your side
And time is getting rough
Oh, yet you seem so far away
So far away, so far away, so far
And there will never be anyone quite like you
There will never be anyone quite like you
