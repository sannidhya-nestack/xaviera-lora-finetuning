Who'd ever believe it would happen like this
That I'd be the one to move on
It took me some time but I finally can see
That I'm much better off on my own
With all of your social skills able to get what you will perfect in most every way
You probably believe that you're just what I need
But I'm much better off on my own
Tired of love's pretension, of lies and jealous rage
It's hard to believe that your charm could deceive me so long
But I'm over you now
Who'd ever believe it would happen like this
That I'd be the one to move on
It took me some time, but I finally can see
That I'm much better off on my own
Tired of love's pretension
Of lies and jealous rage
It's hard to believe that your charm could deceive me so long
But I'm over you now
Who'd ever believe it would happen like this
That I'd be the one to move on
It took me some time but I finally can see
That I'm much better off on my own
Yes, I'm much better off on my own
Yes, I'm much better off on my own
On my own
Yes, I'm much better off on my own
On my own
