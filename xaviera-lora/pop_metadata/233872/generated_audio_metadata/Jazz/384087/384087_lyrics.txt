You and I just dance along
As sun sets sweet to bring us autumn song
Leaves sway from the willow trees
Like hearts that sing within the autumn breeze
Bright autumn leaves and the sun's kiss upon the trees
As we just dance along and sing our autumn song
You and I just fell in love
As sun sets sweet to bring us autumn song
Bright autumn leaves and the sun's kiss upon the trees
As we just dance along and sing our autumn song
You and I just dance along
As sun sets sweet to bring us autumn song
As sun sets sweet to bring us autumn song
