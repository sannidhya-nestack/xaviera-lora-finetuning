All my love will die tonight
With the moon up high
The hope my heart was clinging to
Is worth no more, no more than you
Tonight, I can't find a friend
Tonight, the streets will never end
You were my life, my dream come true
I gave my love, my soul to only you
Tonight I've a heart of stone
And who love cares may take it and make it his own
Tonight all my faith is gone
Tonight desire I have none
A stranger's hand will surely please
Answer the way, the hurt, the memories
Tonight, ever hot off stone
And who that cares may take it and make it his own
And who that cares may take it and make it his own
