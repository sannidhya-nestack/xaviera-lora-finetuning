I'm taking my time this time
Gonna save her every drop
Slow baking, the way we make it
You're gonna beg me not to stop
Gonna take it nice and slow
Turn the lamp down low
Slow and sexy, ain't no crime
We're gonna take our time this time
No need to rush, hastily we got all night
Satisfaction guaranteed, baby, it's alright, alright
We're taking our time this time
A torch is smoldering smooth
Climactic build up, so fine
We're gonna take our time this time
No need to rush hastily
We got all night
Satisfaction guaranteed baby
It's alright, alright
We're taking our time this time
We're taking our time
Climactic build up so fine
We're gonna take our time this time
Taking our time this time
We're gonna take our time
Take our time tonight
