When stars collide
New worlds fill the sky
And something old is new again
Our love will fly
On brand new wings we'll glide like bending time
We'll change the view to bright life colors
All the blue will hang new stars
As something old is new again
Though worlds may end
New stars they do begin
And something old is new again
Our love will fly
On brand new wings we'll glide
Like bending time will change a view
To bright life colors called the blue
Will hang new stars as something old is new again
