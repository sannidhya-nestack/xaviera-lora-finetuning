I guess I need a second chance
It seems I didn't know the meaning of romance
I let myself be fooled and flattered
And couldn't see what really mattered
On flights of fancy that I took
I hardly gave your quiet ways a passing look
But when I finally stopped my running around
There you were, both feet on the ground
I'm hoping now that it could be
You'll take a chance on me
On flights of fancy that I took
I hardly gave your quiet ways a passing look
I'd gladly leave behind such blind fantasy
To share your lovely reality
I'm hoping now that it could be
You'll take a chance on me
