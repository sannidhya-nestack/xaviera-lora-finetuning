They never heard the lies, they never saw the greed
They never felt the pain, I guess they never met me
I'm just a moving, moving
We came out from the alley, it's a must out in the street
We heard the music loud, we listened for the beat
We're just a moving
Move it
Keep me far from blind
By keeping us in line
I never saw the road back home
I guess I never heard them say
We're just moving
Moving
Lately days when the sun go down
I play my music loud till the moon go round
We're just a moving, moving
I get out my keys and I'm looking for the beat
I get up on my leg to get up off my feet
I'm just a moving, moving
I play all day and I sing my song
Looking for the ways, looking for the wrong
Every time the love gone bad
I sing your song, I'm alone
We're just a moving, moving, moving, moving
Take it away.
There's a little known fact that when you lose a race
Don't hold your head in shame you'll be a disgrace
Just keep on moving, moving
When you're looking for truth to your unknown fate
Don't shut the door behind you'll be your broken stake
Just keep on moving, moving
Keep me far from blind
By keeping us in line
I never saw the road back home
I guess I never heard them say
We're just a moving, moving
Just a moving, moving
We're just a moving, moving
But just a moving, moving, moving, moving now
We'll go down
Just a moving, moving
