Close your eyes and dream a dream with me at the end of day
Catch a cloud and float above the earth
Sail the Milky Way
Book a flight upon a shooting star
Move across the sky
There is music in the silence
It's a cosmic lullaby
the shady sycamore
Dream a dream with me
Possibilities unfold
Just close your eyes and you will see
Swim with shiny silver dolphins
Through Tahiti's blue lagoons
Warmed by orchids and it breezes
Polynesian honeymoon
Ride the wind to Argentina
High above the southern sea
Feel the rhythm of the tango
Be my partner, dance with me
Join a caravan of nomads
Winding through the desert night
In a trail of clove and cinnamon
Toward the morning light
Skies ablaze with setting sun
Farewell to yesterday
Twilight beckons to the moon
Purple shadows paint the way
And tomorrow at the end of day
A magic carpet ride
To imaginary places
We will journey
You and I
