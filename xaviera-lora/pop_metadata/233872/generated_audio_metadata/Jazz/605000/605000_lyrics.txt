Calling out around the world, has anybody seen my girl?
Lost her on a night out on the town
She's not very big, about five foot three
But that girl means the world to me
I ain't gonna rest until she's found
Well, she likes to party all night long
That girl, she'll get around
Since I lost her, I've been searching all over town
She got great big hips and woogie lips
Red nails on her fingertips
Kinda girl that turns your head around
When she drinks that bootleg gin
Then, man, you oughta hear her sing
My girl, Mississippi Brown, yeah
Oh yeah! Ha!

I ain't gonna rest until she's found
She likes to party all night long that girl sure gets around
Since I lost her I've been searching all over town
She got great big hips and ruby lips and red nails on her fingertips
Kinda girl that turns your head around
When she drinks that bootleg gin and man you hardly hear her sing
My girl Mississippi Brown
M-I-S-S-I-P-P-I-E
My girl Mississippi Brown
