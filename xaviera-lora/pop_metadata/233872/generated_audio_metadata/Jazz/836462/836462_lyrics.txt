I'm totally wrapped in you
I'm totally apt to cue
I'm totally zapped it's true
I'm totally slapped happy too
I'm totally smitten, totally bitten
It's totally hitting me
I'm entirely, thoroughly
Most assuredly loving you totally
I totally just want you
I totally trust you do
It totally must
Be true, I totally lost after you too
I'm totally daunting, totally gloating, totally floating free
Not part but the whole of me, heart and the soul of me, loving you totally
Not a doubt in our order, about it I go to great lengths to make you see
I'm a hundred percent under your tent
And that's exactly where I wanna be
Totally ooh, la la
You're totally too, ah moi
You're totally cool
The ground, you're totally je ne sais quoi
Totally excited, totally delighted
You've totally ignited me
I'm evenly idly, mentally, bodily
Loving you totally entirely
Most assuredly
Loving you totally
