In the hush of moonlight
There's a place where memories beam
I'll fall away in shades of yesterday
Somewhere in a dream
It's a tale of romance
With an old familiar theme
Again I'm lost within your sweet caress
Somewhere in a dream
I thought that it was for the best
The day had come for us to part
We played our final curtain before I guessed
The scenes would stay inside my heart
Other lips have kissed me
But they're never as they seem
And so forever I'll be holding you somewhere in a dream
I thought that it was for the best
The day had come for us to part
We played our final curtain before I guessed
The scenes would stay inside my heart
Other lips have kissed me
But they're never as they seem
And so forever I'll be holding you
Somewhere in a dream
And so forever I'll be holding you
Somewhere in a dream
