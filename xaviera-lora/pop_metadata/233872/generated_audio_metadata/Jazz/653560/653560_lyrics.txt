Sure I've made some bad decisions
More than once or twice
Lost my sense of intuition
Took some bad advice
But every road to romance has some
Bumps along the way
It's a dance, a game of chance
We all choose to play
Maybe I am idealistic when it comes to love
But lately I'm quite optimistic due to who I'm dreaming of
My heart's found a new direction that's positively true
So I've put my best foot forward and I'm hoping it leads to you
Oh I'm putting my best foot forward
And I'm hoping it leads to you
