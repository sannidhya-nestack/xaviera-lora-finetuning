I'll have to say, I really think you're something
I'll have to say, I think you're marvelous
And if by chance you find
You have the time to pay attention to me
I will gladly clear my calendar
Lucky us today is free
Oh I'll have to say
I really think you're something
I'll have to say
I think you're marvelous
There is nobody else who truly melts my heart
The way that you do
You make anything seem possible
These are just to name a few
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll have to say, I really think you're something
I'll have to say, I think you're marvelous
Maybe someday you'll sing me the song
The way that I sing it to you
That you think I'm something, and marvelous
You think I'm something, and marvelous
You think I'm something, and marvelous
To love to
