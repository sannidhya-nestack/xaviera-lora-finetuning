Walk my way, why don't you walk my way
Tell me what I want to hear
Whisper sweet nothings in my ear
When you walk away with me
Dance with me, why don't you dance with me
Take me now onto the floor
Swing me round, don't let me down
Ramanaad along with me
I want to feel your arms around me
Holding me close to you
Do you want to feel it too?
Tell me true, what do I do?
So will you walk my way?
Why don't you walk my way?
Tell me what I want to hear
Whisper sweet nothings in my ear
When you walk away with me
Walk my way, why don't you walk my way
Tell me what I want to hear
Whisper sweet nothings in my ear
When you walk away with me
Dance with me, why don't you dance with me
Take me now onto the floor
Swing me round, don't let me down
Ramanaad along with me
I want to feel your arms around me
Holding me close to you
Do you want to feel it too?
Tell me true, what do I do?
So will you walk my way?
Why don't you walk my way?
Tell me what I want to hear
Whisper sweet nothings in my ear
When you walk away with me
Promenade this way with me
Won't you walk away with me?
