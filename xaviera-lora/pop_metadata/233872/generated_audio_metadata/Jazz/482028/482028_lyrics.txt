I wonder who's kissing her now
I wonder who's teaching her how
I wonder who's looking into her eyes
Breathing sighs and telling lies
I wonder who's buying the wine
For lips that I used to call mine
I wonder if she
Ever tells him of me
I wonder who's kissing her now
I wonder who's looking into her eyes
Breathing sighs and telling lies
I wonder who's buying the wine
For lips that I used to
I wonder if she ever tells him of me
I wonder, I wonder, sometimes I still wonder
I wonder who's kissing
Who now?
