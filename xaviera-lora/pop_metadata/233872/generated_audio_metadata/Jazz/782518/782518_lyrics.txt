You know me, I'm the one you went for
You know me, I'm the one who tried
You know me, I'm the one you spent all
You know me, I'm the one who lied
Angels in envy, time and time
We never lost the game, we just ran out of time
These streets ain't friendly, no steps to climb
The enemy of sparkling promises precious diamonds
Glide while we swallow hard on precious time
Glide oh glide while we say goodbye to regret that crime
Tell me, how'd you get there?
Did you know somebody? Did you play fair?
Kudos, really great
You stood down time, hey checkmate
Let's go outside, breathe in deep
Drop off state and come back when the wind says when
Wake up late, see two movies
Lose our focus on that heavy second hand
Angels in envy
Time and tide, we never lost the game, we just ran out of time
These streets ain't friendly, no steps to climb
The enemy of sparkling promises precious time
Glide, oh glide, while we swallow hard on precious time
Glide, oh glide
While we say goodbye
To regret that prize
Tell me
How'd you get there?
Did you know somebody?
Did you play fair?
Kudos, really great
You stood down time, hey checkmate
