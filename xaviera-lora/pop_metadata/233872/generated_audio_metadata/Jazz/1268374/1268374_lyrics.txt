Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home?
I'm on the whole night long
I blew the cookin', honey, I paid the rent
I know I done you wrong
You remember that rainy evening
I threw you out with nothing but a fine tooth comb
Yeah, I know I'm to blame now, ain't it a shame?
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home?
Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come on home?
I've known that whole day long
I'll do the cookin', honey, I'll pay the rent
I know I've done you wrong
You remember that rainy evening?
I threw you out with nothing but a fine tooth comb
Yeah, I know I'm to blame now, ain't it a shame?
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home?
And say now won't you please come
Blueberry won't you please come home
Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come on home
I've known that whole day long
I'll do the cookin', honey, I'll pay the rent
I know I've done you wrong
You remember that rainy evening
I threw you out with nothing
But if I do come, y'all know I'm the blame now, ain't it shameful?
Baby, won't you please come?
I said now, won't you please come?
Bill Bailey, won't you please come on home?
