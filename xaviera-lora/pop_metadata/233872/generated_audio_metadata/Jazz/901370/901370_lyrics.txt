It's ten thirty on a Thursday summer night
I'm sitting alone in my kitchen
Drinking my heartache from a glass
Nothing lasts, no surprise
You haven't called
It's no surprise that I'm falling apart
Oh, no surprise
Midnight thirty on this cigarette summer night
The city is an orchestra
Seems that I can't shut my eyes
No surprise you haven't called
It's no surprise that I'm falling apart
I say goodbye if I were wise
No surprise, I still hold on
No surprise when all hope is gone
No surprise
When you walked in, so hard to ignore
I knew I'd seen your type before
My mistake, I saw it coming
But still I loved, now ain't that something
(owl hooting)
No surprise if you haven't called
It's no surprise that I'm falling apart
No surprise
It's ten thirty on a Thursday summer night
No surprise
