I know it's late and I called you while you were sleeping
And I'm sorry there's no one else for me to call
I just need to know that you're there for me
I'm feeling
A little blue
You've always been
Been there for me
I know how I'm feeling day and night blue
ive me for disturbing you
My feelings are so strong
And you left me feeling all alone
You're in my head leading the way
That's why I called you to say
I'm feeling a little blue
That's why I'm calling you
How can I get you?
'Cause I'm feeling a little blue
You've always been, been there for me
Oh, I'm feeling it, I do
ive me for disturbing you
My feelings are so strong
And you left me feeling all alone
You're in my head breathing away
That's why I called you to say
I'm feeling a little blue
That's why I'm calling you blue
