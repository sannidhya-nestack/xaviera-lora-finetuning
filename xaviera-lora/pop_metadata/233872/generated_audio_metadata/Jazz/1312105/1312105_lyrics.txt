My sneakers tap the pavement, vibe sweet like sugar cane
Sung beams on my shoulders, I'm steady in my lane
Confidence in motion, groove carried by the drum
I'm claiming this emotion, let the energy become
Feel that bounce, hey, hey
Drum hits, deep hearts wave
Catch the rhythm, don't delay
Feel that bounce, let it play
Got my girls in sync, shining bright without a doubt
Laughs and little jokes, we got so much to talk about
Keep it light and breezy, let the melody unwind
Flying high in spirit and it always feels so kind
Feel that bounce, hey, hey
Drum hits, deep heart sway
Catch the rhythm, don't delay
Feel that bounce, let it play
We lock into the beat, unstoppable glow
Mind and body free, watch the good vibes flow
Clap clap, yeah the day feels right
Every step in tune, joy shining so bright
When the music calls, I answer without doubt
Feel that bounce baby, listen to us shout
