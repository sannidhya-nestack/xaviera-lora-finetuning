We're gonna be swingin' from the chandeliers (It's a party)
Let's do the ringin' in your ears (It's a party)
Hangin' upside down (Like a monkey)
Actin' like a clown (It's funky)
Three ring circus happenin' here
Just drop everything and start swingin' from the chandeliers
You ain't made of crystal, you ain't made of glass
No big deal if you fall on your head right up to the bandstand and look in the air
The happenin' people are hangin' up there
We're gonna be swangin' from the chandeliers (that's a party)
Unless the tooth is rangin' in your ears (it's a party)
Hangin' upside down (like a monkey)
Actin' like a clown (it's funky)
Three ring circus happenin' here
Just drop everything and start swangin' from the chandeliers
Everybody, party, it's on fire, like a bonfire, yeah, like a bonfire
Well if you wanna get down you got to give it up and know I'm done
If you fall on your butt you know you just might see the light
And rise above your blues tonight
We're gonna be swinging from the chandeliers (that's about it)
Unless the truth is ringing in your ears (it's party)
Hanging upside down (like a monkey)
Acting like a clown
(It's funky)
Three ring circus, happenin' right here
Drop everything and start swingin' from the chandelier
(It's party)
Listen to the ringin' in your ears
(It's party)
Hangin' upside down
(Like monkey)
Actin' like a clown
(It's a monkey)
Three ring circus, happenin' here
Just drop everything and start swingin' from the chandelier
Mmm
