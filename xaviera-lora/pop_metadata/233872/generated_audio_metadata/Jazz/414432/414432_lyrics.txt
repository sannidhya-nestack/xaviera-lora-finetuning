Don't be pretentious, I'm not that naive
I know you're planning to leave
Don't stay one more day
I won't be deceived
If there's a chance then I'll plead
Love's supposed to be all you need
Love would bring you back to me
With only a second chance
You say you're happy to be on your way
How long can you stay away
Home is where the heart is
So where is your heart?
You told me once it was mine
Love is supposed to be all you need
Love would bring you back to me with only seconds
Love's supposed to be all you need
Love would bring you back to me
Love supposed to be all you need, yeah
Love would bring you back to me
With only
A second chance
