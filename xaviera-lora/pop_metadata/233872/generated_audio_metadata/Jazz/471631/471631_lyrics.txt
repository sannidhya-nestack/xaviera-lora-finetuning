Stormy waters, lovers gone astray
Washing away
Stormy waters, such a lonely day, wash it away
On a bridge from afar
I watch the stormy waters push us further apart
I fear the hurt in me is here to stay
Until the stormy waters go away
Stormy waters over land and sea
Keep you from me
A cold cold water I want to finally release
Please set me free
On a bridge from afar
I watch the stormy waters push us further apart
I fear the hurt in me is here to stay
Until the stormy waters go away
Oh water
Stormy water
On a bridge from afar
I watch the stormy waters push us further apart
I see the stormy waters on our bridge from afar
I watch the stormy waters push us farther apart
I feel the hurt in me is here to stay
Until the stormy waters go away
I know this heart in me is here to stay
Until the stormy waters go away
Go away
