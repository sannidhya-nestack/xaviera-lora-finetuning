There's just nothing we know and feel that you're not young
And we don't hurt another day
Driving in my car in the middle of the day
Finished with my work now it's time to play
Been a long hot day'cause I'm thinking about
Your love, can't live without
Now I'm out on the road doing 80
Jamming to the hippie hop just like in Haiti
Drop top down in the sun
Making little trip to see my number one hun
Do what you do
I like the way you do it
Driving, driving
Me wild, all the time
I got the rhythm, you got the rhyme
Driving, driving
Me wild, everyday
I got the will, if you got the way
Driving in my car in the middle of the night
Cop pulled me over started reading my rights
I looked right at him and said
Wish I could hang but that'd put me late
By a god dang minute on my date
Straight mate a hot little swamp fox taking the bait
So the cop gave in cause he knew that look
He had seen it all before and he knew exactly what it took
Do what you do
I like the way you do it
Driving driving
Me wild, all the time
I got the rhythm, you got the rhyme
Driving, driving
Me wild, everyday
I got the will, if you got the way
You got the way, you got the way
I got the rhythm, you got the rhyme
Ooh, ah, hit me, take my time
Ooh, ah, hit me, lose my mind
Throwin' down with a lyrical jam
So deaf, you gotta say "damn"
Smooth like a razor through the microphone
Cuttin' through like static on your telephone
Listen to the lyrical master
Blastin' on the scene and creating a disaster
Boom, huh, right on cue
Before you know it, I've bought and sold you
Drivin', drivin' me wild
All the time, I got the rhythm
You got the rhyme, driving, driving me wild every day
I got the will if you got the way, driving, driving me wild all the time
I got the rhythm, you got the rhyme
Driving, driving me wild every day
I got the will if you got the way
Driving, driving me wild
