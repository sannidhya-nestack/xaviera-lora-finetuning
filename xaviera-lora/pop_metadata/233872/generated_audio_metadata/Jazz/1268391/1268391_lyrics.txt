That's a plan, it's gotta be in it
The rhythm's got a lot of heart in it
Bet you five, ten to five
It's gonna get you doing what it's doing to me
The Dixieland comes oozing out of it
The Dixielanders sure are proud of it
They call it jazz when it has
That's a plan for me
Switch it down to New Orleans
Down Basin Street with all the queens
You don't have to have the means
A little bit, you're doing what it's doing to me
The Dixieland comes losing out of it
The Dixieland is sure proud of it
Then all the jazz, what it has, that's a plenty for me
Relax, you're down to New Orleans
Down Basin Street with all the queens
You don't have to have the means
A little bit of rhythm and you're going right with them
Shut my big brown rolling eyes if you don't rock it to the skies
Hey boy, say boy, that's a pleasure for me
You're gonna get mellow when that fella blows his horn
Down where the blues were born you'll be gone
The trumpets are trumpin' but go do me something
Beat it out brother there's no other remedy
And that's a plenty, plenty, plenty for me
Once you start, you're gonna stay on it
Every night you're out cafe'ing it
Swing your queen, what I mean
Brother, you're as gone as any human can be
And when you're in the mood, there ain't no stopping it
Live it, breathe it, blow your top in it
That is jazz, what it has, that's a plenty for me
Takes you down to New Orleans
Down Basin Street with all the queens
You don't have to have the means
A little bit of rhythm and you're going right with them
Shut my big brown rolling eyes
If you don't rock it to the skies
Hey boy, sing boy, that's a plenty for me
