Late last night, now don't tell nobody
I can't explain what I saw, so don't say a word
Late last night, I saw blood river rising
Bad luck and trouble on the horizon
Late last night, now don't say a word
Late last night, you're gonna think I'm crazy
I heard a knock on my door, you're gonna think I'm nuts
But late last night, the devil came for me
He said he couldn't stay, but he'd be back shortly
Late last night, now don't say a word
Late last night, I caught all the king's horses
Late last night, I called in a favor to the queen
Late last night, I saw a flood river rising
Bad luck and trouble on the horizon
Late last night, now don't say a word
Late last night, late last night
Ooh, I got a bad, bad feeling
