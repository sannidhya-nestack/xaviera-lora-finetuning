I don't like pictures, I don't like pictures of me
I don't like pictures, I don't like pictures of me
Bad haircuts, bad sweaters, you know I've had a few
Remind me of all the chances that I had and I blew
I don't like pictures unless they're pictures of you
I don't like pictures, I don't like pictures of me
I don't like pictures, I don't like pictures of me
Best buddies, distant cousins that I barely knew
You paint a smile on and act all happy for a second or two
I don't like pictures unless they're pictures of you
All I need are my fond memories
Manipulate them, store and rate them
Recreate them as tailor made realities
I'll do with them as I please
I don't like pictures, I don't like pictures of me
I don't like pictures, I don't like pictures of me
I don't like'em, I don't trust'em
Their slanted point of view
The injustice of forced smiling is so painfully true
All I need is a big fat picture of you
All I need is a big fat picture of you
