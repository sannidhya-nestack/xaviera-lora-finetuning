Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The rhythm of life
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The rhythm is free
Like the sky and the sea
Rhythm is free
Like the sky and the sea
The surf is a living thing
The world has a heart
The world as a heartbeat
Seize the day
You'll never know how long it's here to stay
Look within
You'll find yourself, you can begin again
If you open up your mind
Set it free, stop wasting time
Don't look back, what's gone is gone, you can't et the past
Feed your way into a life, you'll find a better way
If you open up your mind, set it free, stop wasting time
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
The rhythm of life
