I'm through with romance
I'm through with love
I've been around too long
And I don't need anyone
Once there were bluebirds
And stars in the sky
Now there's only rain drops
Like tears that used to fall from my eyes
No more heartache, no more sorrow
Hip hip hip hooray
I got my memories I can cling to
Who needs your love anyway
Oh maybe sweet kisses
And someone to hold tight
Somebody to come home to
Maybe that would be nice
No more heartache, no more sorrow
Hip, hip, hip, hooray
I got my memories I've been clingin' to
Who needs love anyway?
Oh maybe sweet kisses with someone to hold tight
Somebody to come home to
Oh maybe that would be nice
