This road I'm on seems like a tunnel
With no end, no end in sight
They say that I got to keep on going
To the end of the road and I'll see the light
Sometimes I get so tired and weary
Of fighting the road
All day and night
But this road I'm on
It just takes me closer
To the end of the road
And I'll see the light
I'm just passing through
Can't stay too long
I'll put my weary soul to rest when I get home
So if I seem to pass you by
I'm just looking for the end of the road
I'm looking for the light
Sometimes I'd like
To take a detour
Take my time and see the sights
But I know I got to keep on going
To the end of the road and I'll see the light
I'm just passing through, can't stay too long
I'll put my weary soul to rest when I get home
So if I seem to pass you by
I'm just looking for the end of the road
I'm looking for the light
So if I seem to pass you by
I'm just looking for the end of the road, I'm looking for the light
I'm just looking for the end of the road, I'm looking for the light
