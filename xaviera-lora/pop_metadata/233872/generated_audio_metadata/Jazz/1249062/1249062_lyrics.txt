Did you ever have a wish for a girl who could inspire a ten-thousand-year itch of the hell-a-heart desire?
Well, let me introduce you, please, to a girl who fits the bill
I think she took the little red pill
She's a sight to see, miss money
A smile worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She struts in her high heel shoes
Life's gotten better, she got everything to lose
That shoe's so fly, I have to get a airplane seat
At what cost?
Lost a pretty penny, come and get some
Would you like a little treat?
Turning heads everywhere, trust me there are very, very many
She's a little more than filthy rich, one-top bitch
Welcome to the sweetness
Did you ever, ever have a wish
For a girl who could inspire?
A ten thousand year itch
Oh, a hella hot desire
Well, let me introduce you, please
To a girl who fits the bill
I think she took the little red pill
One tough bitch, welcome to the sweetness
Oh, Miss Money
No one's sexy, sweet honey
Is it fame that you adore, miss money?
Now you got a little, would you like a little more, miss money?
Sweet little honey, I can see that you are vexed
Take a minute, check your mobile
Tell me if you got my text
Flexible, finessing, I can see that you've been messin'
With some things I think you think that you've never seen before
She's got a wallet that is quite a little fatty
Generous, she is very, very, very catty
Buying up the love, it's something that she can't ever seem to get enough of
A swipe of a card, like to play the part, crashing it very hard in the market for a heart
Oh miss money, you're a fantasy, I think about you every day
I wonder if you will ever be a significant other person to a person in your life
Maybe you're a girlfriend, maybe you're a wife
This money, oh she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle green in her eye
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
She's got a stockpile of sweet admirers
They're all just the assets that are fueling her desires
She trades her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment, not selling just to park it
Her laughter rings like a cash register
Shining but love's a currency
She can't see you mine, a portfolio of hearts, oh what a portfolio
But the dividend, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
She's got a stockpile of sweet admirers
They're all just the assets that are fueling her desires
She trades her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment, not selling just to park it
Her laughter rings like a cash register chime
But love's a currency she can't seem to mine a footfall
Over your heart, so hard, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
