Come catch a ride with me
To the nearest star you see
That's just a bit dreamy
That's just like me
Let's dance the days away
On the tops of clouds and sky
Gonna live so free now
That's just like me
I'm a little bit lazy
And a little bit crazy
And a lot of in love with you
Because I'm not so hazy
Words are singing so easy
And I can tell you you're the one for me
I'm gonna misbehave sometimes
Gonna laugh and cry sometimes
Gonna love you for all times
That's just like me
I'm looking at you there kid
I'm singing this once again
Gonna love you for all times
That's just like
Gonna love you for all times
That's just like
Gonna love you for all times
That's just like me
