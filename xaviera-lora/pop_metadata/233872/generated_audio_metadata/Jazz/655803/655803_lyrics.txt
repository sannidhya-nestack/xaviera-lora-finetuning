I never thought it would be like this
Well look what happened with just one kiss
You've made a heaven on earth
Now my heart's in your hand
It seems my feet never touch the ground
I'm holding on to this love I've found
You've turned my world upside down
Now my heart's in your hand
All I see are blue skies and rainbows never clouds of grey
And I seem to keep on smiling from early in the morning and all through the day
Well, this must mean we were meant to be
From now on it's just you and me
You found the key to my heart and my heart's in your hands
I never thought it would be like this
Well look what happened with just one kiss
You've made a heaven on earth
Now my heart's in your hand
It seems my feet never touch the ground
I'm holding on to this love I've found
You've turned my world upside down
Now my heart's in your hands
All I see are blue skies and rainbows never clouds of grey
And I seem to keep on smiling from early in the morning and all through the day
Well, this must mean we were meant to be
From now on it's just you and me
You found the key to my heart and my heart's in your hands
