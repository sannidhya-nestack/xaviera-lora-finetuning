Just another grey morning
To go with another grey day
Another moon goes in hiding
To escape the problems on the way
Another grey morning
Don't you ever feel that way
You sing my song
You know the words
So sing along
Help me to say
I won't have it that way
And now the skies are clearing
A little light is shining through
Why do they look like you?
Another great morning
Don't you ever feel that way
You sing my songs, you know the words
So sing along, help me to say
I won't have it that way
