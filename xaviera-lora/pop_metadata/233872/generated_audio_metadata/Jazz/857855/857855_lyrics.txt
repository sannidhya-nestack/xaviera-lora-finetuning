You ask me why is the sky so blue
I can't tell you
Why the sun rises anew
Each and every morning
Ask me what do I need to be happy
I never really knew
All that I know that is true
Is all I'll ever need is you
Ask me how many stars fill the sky, I'm not certain
How does a bird learn to fly, I surely wonder
Ask me what would it take to make all my dreams come true
All that I know that is true
Is all I'll ever need is you
For all of my life I've been wandering
Wishing and wanting for love
Now all my searching is over
You're what my dreams were made of
Ask me how many fish in the sea
I can't imagine
How does a robin purse sing
Does she love the music
How does a rosebud know how to bloom
All that I know that is true
Is all I'll ever need is
All that I know that is true
Is all I'll ever need is
All that I know that is true
Is all I'll ever need is
You
