Cigarette in a cup
Key is on the bed
Empty closet
Empty drawer
I am done
I'm through receiving free room perks
How self-deceiving
I'm checking out
Watch my debt piling up
Tension in my head
Reputation out the door
I won't back
I'm through with dealing
I can't live grifting and stealing
I'm checking out
I'm checking out of here
Today is my new year
Operator, thank you for my wake up call
Don't wanna take a fall and I ain't doing time
For him or me
A gambler's fate ain't my destiny
Buy roulette, nine straight up
No use, black or red
Empty pockets, what's in store
Never mind, I've got to believe this
I can't win, walk out and leave this
I'm checking out
I'm checking out
