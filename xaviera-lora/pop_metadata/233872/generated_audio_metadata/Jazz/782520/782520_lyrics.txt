Who am I to say what are you to do
Where am I to go without you
There's no one to blame for the seasons change
It will rain all day without you
Get night get even get ready
Stay low, be calm, be steady
Steady'til the end, you know it's just around the bend
Sing all day, all night, you know you're dying
Nothing here to see, you know it's down to you and me
Though we may feel high, we're not flying
Get mad, get even, get ready
Stay low, look out, be steady
I just left the building and it's not just in my mind
Same grey white black dream every single time
Oh time my time your time
Stay with me my dear you know we've got so much to fear
Show me that this life is worth living
Feel the earth below, you know it shakes us to our bones
Show me something's good and giving
Get mad, get even, get ready
Stay low, be calm, be steady
Get mad, get even, get ready
Stay low, look out, be steady
My friend, just play
Get up, get in, get ready
Get down, get even, get ready
Get up, get in
Get ready
Get high, get it in
Get ready
Get high, get it in
Get ready
