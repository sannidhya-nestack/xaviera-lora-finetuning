All the candles on the cave light up your lovely face
They don't shine as bright as you, my dear
Relax, take a breath
Don't et to make a wish
A moment to reflect upon the year
Happy birthday baby, we love you
Happy birthday baby, all the things you do
Happy birthday baby, all your friends are here
To help you celebrate another year
Happy birthday baby you improve with age
Happy birthday baby you are all the rage
Happy birthday baby we're so glad you're here
Like a fine wine you get better every year
Please don't ever be dismayed
When you find a little grey
Or just a bit more texture on your face
Every little line and shade reminds me of the life we've made
Moments that can never be replaced
Happy birthday baby I'm in love with you
Happy birthday baby ooh this love is true
Happy birthday baby I'm so glad you're here
Like a fine wine you get better every year
Happy, happy birthday my dear
