One evening long ago, they stood there disbelieving
One evening long ago, the steamboat was leaving
The sailors formed a line, the beacon lights said go
One very last goodbye, one evening
Long ago
Long ago
One evening long ago
Two people were changing
One evening long ago
Two lives were rearranging
The sailors formed a line
The beacon light said go
One very last goodbye
One evening long ago
Well, it's getting misty out here
Yes, it's getting misty out here
The water ain't blue and the sky is grey
And the sailor's home is always away
It's getting misty out here
Long ago
One evening long ago
The memories been faded
The evening long ago
The time has abandoned
The sailors formed a line
The beacon lights said go
One very last goodbye
One evening long ago
Long ago
One evening long ago
