I can't help but wonder
If I'm under a spell
It's more than a passing notion
I've never fallen with such devotion
I can't help but wonder
If it's only a dream
Am I naive or can I believe
That things are really as they seem
Can anyone explain it
How to understand what's true
I know I just can't tame it
Whenever I'm with you
I can't help but wonder
If you wonder about me
lately I can't help but wonder
How wonderful this might be
Can anyone explain it
How to understand what's true
I know I just can't tame it
Whenever I'm with you
I can't help but wonder
If you wonder'bout me
'Cause lately I can't help but wonder
How wonderful this might be
lately I can't help but wonder
How wonderful this might be
Be
