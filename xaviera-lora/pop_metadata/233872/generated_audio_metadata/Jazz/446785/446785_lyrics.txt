Skipping across the lake, tumbling down the hill
Thrown under the bus, never had free will
Frozen under snow, dripping winter wet
Hammer and chisel, maybe one you met
Sat for years and shed no tears
I've been carried, I've been thrown
Left for dead but never bled
I've been piled and left alone
In riverbed I sleep, gurgling with the brook
Timeless sinful beauty peak, but never look
Water rolls on over best times I've known
Sun speckled and dabbled, I'm your river stone
Chipped off my old man, never spoke a word
Lessons I have learned, things I never heard
Group used for ballast, Asian gardens best
Been here forever, though I know no zest
I'm grey, I'm a alabaster, silver shell and blistering white
I glimmer underwater and shine in the moonlight
In a river bed I sleep, gurgling with the brook
Timeless sinful beauty peak but never look
Water rolls on over best times unknown
Sun-spangled and dabbled, I'm your river stone
Slow motion grind through centuries
Turn me into sand
Smooth as ice with solid core
Wonder that I am
In Riverbed I sleep, gurgling with the brook
Timeless sinful beauty, peak but never look
Water rolls on over best times I've known
Sun speckled and dabbled, I'm your Riverstone
Sun speckled and dabbled, I'm your Riverstone
I'm your Riverstone
I'm your Everett Stone
