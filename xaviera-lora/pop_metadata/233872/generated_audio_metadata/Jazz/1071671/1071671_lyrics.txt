The grass needs mowing, I can't get going
Not enough reason to move
My eyelids are heavy and the blankets are warm
I just can't get back in the groove
I met her last night, a late night plane flight
I can't get her out of my head
I dreamed of romance, now it's time to wake up
But I'd rather keep on dreaming instead
Sleepy Sunday feeling lazy and tired
Maybe Monday I'll get inspired
The winds of ambition may sweep me away
But that ain't gonna happen today
Now there's church bells ringing
Sure the choirs are singing
And I remain lost in this mist
This sleepy dream state
Imagine in love with the woman that I wished that I'd kissed
Well I'll call her who knows
Can't say where love goes
I have no control over fate
But for the moment
I'll be dreaming of her
It looks like I'll be sleeping in late
Sleepy Sunday, feeling lazy and tired
Maybe Monday I'll get inspired
The winds of ambition may sweep me away
But that ain't gonna happen today
