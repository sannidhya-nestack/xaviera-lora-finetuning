Cover one eyebrow with your hat, then take me uptown
Duke the valet and the captain spreads the loot around
Wear a black or grey suit, never brown
Just do what Frank would do and I'm your gal
Never cuss'round, ladies
Don't let my drink get warm
Be the last to fade each night
The first to greet the dawn
Don't throw in the first punch or the towel
Do what Frank would do and I'm your gal
Say what Frank would say
Play how Frank would play
Choose your poison, never give in
Make your choice and show some passion
Hang around with VIPs so they can think they're cool
Sing me love songs from your knees
I'll swoon off my stool
Enunciate each consonant and vowel
Do what Frank would do and I'm your gal
Smile like Frankie Smiles
Style like Frankie Styles
Make me laugh with all your joking
Take me back to your Hoboken
Treat your kids like royalty
Your mom and daddy too
Keep that Rat Pack loyalty
Don't compromise your view
Have a guy like Dean for your best pal
Do what Frank would do and I'm your gal
Do what Frank would do guys
Bat those big ol' blue eyes
Doobie doobie doobie'til the final bow
Do what Frank would do and I'm your chick
