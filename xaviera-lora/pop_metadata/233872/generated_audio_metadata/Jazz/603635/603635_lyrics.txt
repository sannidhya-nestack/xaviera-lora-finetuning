Salty breezes blow my hair
Sultry music fills the air, lovely
It's lovely
Amber moon hangs in the night
Lover's paradise delight
Lovely
It's lovely
Loveliest of all are your lips of wine
Ooh, kissing mine
Loveliest of all
Nothing's more divine
Loveliest of all
Salty breezes blow my hair
Sultry music fills the air, lovely
It's lovely, loveliest of all
Are your lips of wine?
Ooh, kissing mine
Loveliest of all, nothing's more divine
Loveliest of all
Loveliest of all
Loveliest of all
