Any day now, love will find me
When or where, who can say?
Any day now, love will hold fast
Not go drifting away
Fate will come to call
Drop in after all
And there won't be any more disappointments knocking at my door
I've been waiting such a long time for someone of my own
Watching lovers find each other while I walk on alone
Always standing at the sidelines wondering how it would be
Any day now, I just know it
Love will finally find me
Fate will come to call
Drop in after all
And there won't be anymore disappointment
Knocking at my door
I've been waiting such a long time
For someone of my own
Watching lovers find each other
While I walk all alone
Always standing at the sidelines
Wondering how it would be
Any day now, I just know it
Love will finally find me
I just know it, love will finally find me, oh
Any day now
