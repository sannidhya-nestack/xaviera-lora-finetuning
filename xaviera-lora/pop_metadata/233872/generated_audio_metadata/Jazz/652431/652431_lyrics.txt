Feeling old, so what's new?
Every day brings a different shade of blue
Nothing can change your point of view
When love has gone
Nothing more, nothing less
There is nothing here except this emptiness
Nothing's right, nothing left to say when love has gone
Once I believed that love could last forever
But now that feeling's not the same
Though I believe in nothing whatsoever
Nothing matters, nothing ventured, nothing gained
Such is life, c'est la vie
Guess it simply wasn't meant to be
Here alone with these memories
When love has gone
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
Once I believed that love could last forever
But now that feeling's not the same
Now I believe in nothing whatsoever
Nothing matters, nothing ventured, nothing gained
Such is life, c'est la vie
Guess it simply wasn't meant to be
Here alone with these memories
When love has gone, when love has gone
When love has gone
