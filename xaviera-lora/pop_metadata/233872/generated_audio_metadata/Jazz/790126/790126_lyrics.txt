We should've turned the heat down, instead we made sparks fly
We'll soup the nuts, the night we touched, didn't waste no time
Microwave oven lovin', hot in a hurry, done too fast
Microwave oven lovin', we ran out of gas
We were hot on the outside, cold on the inside, wrapped up in the dark
We closed the door, then took a spin and we just fell apart
Microwave oven lovin', hot in a hurry, done too fast
Microwave oven lovin', we ran out of gas
Microwave oven lovin', hot in a hurry, done too fast
Microwave oven lovin', we ran out of gas
Rocked a wave of another
How'd it hurt? I jumped too fast
Rocked a wave of another
We ran out of gas
We ran out of gas
We ran out of gas
