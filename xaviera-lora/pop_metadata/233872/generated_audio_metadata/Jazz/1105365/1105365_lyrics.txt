Sparks just fly right out of the blue
There's no way I can't deny the magic of you
Our eyes meet and that is your cue
Suddenly my heart's complete with the magic of you
You got something up your sleeve that you do not reveal
All I know is I believe in the way you make me feel
Slight of hand, yes that could be true
It's not for me to understand the magic of you
You always seem to have the knack for my dreams to come true
You got something up your sleeve that you do not reveal
All I know is I believe in the way you make me feel
Oh, sleight of hand, yes that could be true
It's not for me to understand
The magic of you, do what you do
That's the magic of you
