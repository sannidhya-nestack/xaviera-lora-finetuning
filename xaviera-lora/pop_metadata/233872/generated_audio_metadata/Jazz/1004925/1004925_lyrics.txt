Memories that are untold
Secrets kept out in the cold
Tell me why you came back here
Tell me now
Even though I know you've gone
Lonely nights just me alone
Now you're here and then you're gone
Tell me why
Now and then I'd think of us
Think about what should have been
What could have been
What would have been
When a life begins or ends
A day, a night, a seamless blend
Lonely hearts that never mend, tell me why
Why'd you leave me standing there
All alone and in despair
It's not me you're thinking of
Tell me who
Tell me how I should love you
Tell me now what should I do
Start anew with you
Please tell me who
Tell me why, tell me now
