Let's get away
Let's travel way down south
Let's find the sun
Just you and me
Pack up your bags
Put on your shoes
We'll go today
And we'll have a fun experience
Somewhere along the way
I'm tired of this old town
Long days that get me down
I'd rather be with you out there
So let's put on our travel shoes and go today
We can make it just in time for lunch
Yeah we can make it just in time for lunch in Monterey
[Silence]
Let's head out south
I wanna go to Mexico
Let's see the mountains
The sun and the sea
We can go out to Tampico beach
Just for the day
And we'll have a fun experience
Somewhere along the way
Now I'm ready for a break
From the nine to five, yeah
I wanna climb
The Mount of Kings
So let's put on our travel shoes and go
Today we can make it just in time for lunch
Yeah we can make it just in time for lunch in Monterey
