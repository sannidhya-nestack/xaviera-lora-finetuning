The green grass on the other side
Is a Cheshire cat like smile a half mile wide
The green grass on the other side
Is a creepy stranger offering you a ride
But don't let it fool you
Don't let it get into your head
Don't let it school you
You sleep where you make your bed
It'll lead you down a path you'll soon regret
And then the green grass won't look so green anymore
It'll brown and frown and slam and lock the door
the green grass that paves the way to Easy Street
Was all along right there beneath your feet
The green grass on the other side
Is a pair of dice, of warm fuzzy dice, let it ride
The green grass on the other side
Is your old girlfriend when she said that she loved you and lied
But don't let it fool you
Don't let it get into your head
Don't let it school you
You sleep where you make your bed
It'll lead you down a path you'll soon regret
And then the green grass won't look so green to your eyes
It'll promise you maybe like a spoiled little baby that cries
'Cause the green grass that paves the way to easy street
Is right there, right there beneath your feet
Yeah, right there beneath your feet
Yeah, right there beneath your feet
