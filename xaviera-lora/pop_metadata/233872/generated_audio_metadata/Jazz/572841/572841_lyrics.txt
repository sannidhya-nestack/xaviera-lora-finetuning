If I knew you, I might know
What kind of flowers in your garden grow
What kind of colors make your eyes glow
And if they're brown or they're blue
If you knew me, you'd like me
You'd know what a heck of a guy I can be
We'd fall in love eventually if we only knew
Maybe someday we'll look back on this
We're gonna reminisce just like old couples do
old couples were strangers once too
If I knew you, I'd know your name
And how you put all your friends to shame
Your nights of losing at the dating game
Would be officially through
If you knew me, I'd open the door
To all the beauty that life has in store
And we'd have found what we've been looking for
If we only knew, if we only knew
Maybe someday we'll look back on this
Yeah, we're gonna reminisce just like old couples do
old couples were strangers once too
If I knew you I wouldn't ask
About the guys you loved in the past
I wouldn't have to wear a silly mask
To prove myself to you
If you knew me, I'd open the door
To all the beauty that life has in store
And we'd have found what we've been looking for
If we only knew
If we only knew
If we only knew
