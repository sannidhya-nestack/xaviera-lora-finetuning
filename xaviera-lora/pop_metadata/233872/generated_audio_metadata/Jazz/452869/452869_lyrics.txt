The shadow followed us home
There is a darkness walking behind us all
Slowly, slowly it whispers and hisses in our ears
Until we stop and listen
Stop and listen
Stop and listen to what is inside
To what we cannot hide
Slowly, slowly it whispers
And hisses in our ears
It shivers up our spines and tells us stories
We don't want to hear
Until we stop and listen
Stop and listen, yeah, and stop and listen
To what is inside, to what we cannot hide
To what we all see, to what we know is real
To what resides inside
Stop and breathe, stop and breathe, stop and breathe
Then we don't want to listen
Then we don't want to feel
We keep ourselves busy
Distracted with thinking and drowning
And tripping
Toxifying ourselves
Until we stop and listen
Stop and listen
Stop and listen to what is real
Stop and breathe, stop and breathe, stop and breathe
Stop and breathe
Stop and breathe
Stop and breathe
