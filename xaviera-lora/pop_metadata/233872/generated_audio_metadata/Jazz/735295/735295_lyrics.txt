You can't win a race with money
You don't need to waste a dime
I'd rather end each day with you
And honey spend some time
Or leave that visa home baby
Pick me up at night
And charge into my wedding arms
And honey spend some time
Oh we can talk tonight dear
Beneath the stars above
We can walk a light year, that's not far enough
Hey, I'd rather ride a rainbow than in limousines that shine
There's one'round every bend with you, so honey, let's spend some time
(animal sound)
Oh, we can talk tonight, dear
Underneath the stars above
We can walk a light year
And that's not far enough
We can't eat bread, no, we don't need no bread
We can't fish with credit line
So keep me in your arms forever, honey
Let's spend some time
Let's spend some time
Oh, let's spend some time
I'm waiting for you
