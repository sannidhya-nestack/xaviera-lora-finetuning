Helpless, helplessly falling
I don't know how to begin
Won't you believe me when I look in your eyes
That I'm helplessly falling for you
Helpless, helplessly searching
Deep in your eyes for a sign
Won't you come ask me and I'll tell you it's true
That I've helplessly fallen for you
Why do you keep my heart waiting?
When will you see what I know?
Why can't you hear my heart calling?
When will you let your heart believe that?
Helpless, helplessly calling
Reaching for you in my dreams
Please let me love you forever tonight
Now I'm helplessly falling in love
Helpless, helplessly falling
Wondering what more to say
Please let me show you how I know you're the one
I'm helplessly falling in love
I'm helplessly falling, helplessly falling
I'm helplessly falling in love
Helplessly falling in love
