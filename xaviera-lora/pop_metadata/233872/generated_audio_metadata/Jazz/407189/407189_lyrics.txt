Walking down the street, shuffling my feet, dreaming of sunshine
The day would be so fine when I'm here with you
But you're out of reach again, and so I descend to the present
The weather's not so pleasant, think I'll stay inside
I could get lost in the rain and wander for hours
But my will is weak and I don't have the powers to keep from dreaming of you
Now girl I've known from the start so please don't depart
You cannot deny my love to reply
Believe me I'm down on my knees
Oh girl, you know it's true
There's a hole in my heart when I'm not with you
Lonely nights and days
Girl, I miss you right now in so many ways
Baby, can't you see?
You and I were meant to be
I could get lost in the rain and wander for hours
But my will is weak and I don't have the powers to keep from
Dreaming of you
Now girl, I've known from the start, so please don't depart
You cannot deny my love to reply, believe me
I'm down on my knees
Oh, girl, you know it's true
There's a hole in my heart when I'm not with you
Lonely nights and days
Girl, I miss you right now in so many ways
Baby, can't you see?
You and I were meant to be
You and I were meant to be
Oh, you and I were meant to be
