My old man once told me
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth
If you ain't got nothing nice to say
It's best you leave it out
Leave it out my friend
I tell you
Let prudence be your guide
Folks warm up to the positive
So leave the negative inside
I like to bitch, I like to moan and groan
I'll bitch and flick'til those cows come home like an itch
They won't leave me alone, pardon all my bawlin'
It's my nature, my true callin', I like to bitch, I got a moan of my own
You bring the pick, and I'll bring the bone
I know it's kinda sorry for a man that's full grown
But I like to bitch, I like to bitch
Y'all have heard the story of Nero's fiery plight
What the textbooks fail to mention was the guy just wasn't right
He'd play that goddamn fiddle morning, noon, and night
Just think where Rome might be today if someone had just griped
Excuse me, Nero, could you give it a rest?
Enough with the fiddle already, I mean, I got a splitting headache
I don't know if it's you or that stick
Don't you smell something? Smells like something's burning
I would have pitched and moaned
I would have pitched a fit
Till those cows came home like an itch
That would leave me alone
If you find me pathetic
Then you really just don't get it
I like to pitch
I got a moan of my own
You bring the pick
And I'll bring the bone
I know I'm kinda sorry for a man that's full grown
But I like to pitch
I like to pitch
Let me tell another story about a general and his men
How he led his 7th cavalry to a very senseless end
This could have been prevented all those boys need not be dead
If one outspoken soldier had gotten up and said
Excuse me, General Custer, sir, boys and I have been talking and we're really not feeling so good today
We don't think it's such a great day for a battle and last count there was what, 20 ,000 of them, 400 of us?
I would have bitched, I would have moaned and groaned
I would have pitched a fit'til them cows came home like an itch
That wouldn't let me alone
You gotta love my bone
It's my nature, my true calling
I like to bitch, I got a bone of my own
You bring the pick and I'll bring the bone
Most think I'm kinda sorry for a man that's full grown
But I got a wine like a vintage Merlot
I like to bitch, I like to bitch, I like to bitch
