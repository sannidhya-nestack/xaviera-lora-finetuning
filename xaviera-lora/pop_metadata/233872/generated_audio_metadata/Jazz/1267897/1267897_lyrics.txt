Up all night thinking of you
I can't get you out of my mind
I feel like a fool for walking away but now
I want you back to stay up all night
I'm missing a screw
I hate that I need you so bad
You make me so mad
But you're the best I ever had
You got me up all night
I thought that I'd be happy on my own
Now here I am standing all alone
Wanting you to come back home to me
Up all night, hating myself
For giving you all of my heart
I let down my guard, I let my soul fall
Now I just can't get up at all
Up all night, what can I do?
But say I ride my phone and feel blue
Do you think I'm in two?
Or have you found somebody new?
You got me up all night
I thought that I'd be happy on my own
Now here I am so sad and alone
I don't want you to come back home to me
Oh, up all night, missing a screw
I hate that I need you so bad
You make me so mad, but you're the best I ever had
You got me up all night
You got me up all night
