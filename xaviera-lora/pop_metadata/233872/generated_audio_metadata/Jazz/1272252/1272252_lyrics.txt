Music, music, music, music, music, music, music
Music started once with a heartbeat
There'd be no life without it
Feel the rhythm, the lungs deep
In your body and soul
Music, so inviting and misty
Softly leads us to our romance
Softly whispering into our ears
Something daring and bold
Darling, let's dance our life walking on air
Let us pretend we're ginger and Fred Astaire in the gay divorcee
See them walks in the night away
All we need is the music
For ourselves to become as one
Butterflies on the silver screen
We'll be walking on air
Darling, let's dance, our life walking on air
Let us pretend we're ginger and Fred Astaire in the gate
Evil says Shirley, let's watch the night away
All we need is the music
We'll be walking on air
On air
(Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic, fantastic, fantastic, fantastic, fantastic)
Butterflies on the silver screen
Let us become as one
Music, feel the music
Music, so enticing and sultry
Could there be love without it?
Could there be love without a heartbeat?
Oh darling
Our hearts entwine
We'll be walking on air
Let us pretend we're ginger and Fred Astaire
In the gay divorcee, darling
Let's dance the night away
All we need is the music
We'll be walking on air
On air
We'll be walking on air
On air, butterflies on the silver screen
