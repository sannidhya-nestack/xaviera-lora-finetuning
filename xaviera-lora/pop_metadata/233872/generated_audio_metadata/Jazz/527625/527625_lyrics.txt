When I saw you there, I just held my breath
I was so confused about the way that I thought and I felt
Then two became one and then two more
And before I knew, I couldn't go on anymore just by myself
I know that I don't talk about it
But it's not that I don't care
It's just deep inside this fool am I
With only heart songs to share
Oh, it's a crazy world (it's a crazy world)
It's hard to think that you can make it through
You just keep on spinning around we go
And then life moves on (life moves on)
But time and time again it's true
The little things that you do just thrill me so, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I know that I don't talk about it but it's not that I don't care
It's just deep inside this fool am I with only heart songs (heart songs) to share
Heart songs
Heart songs
Heart songs
When I see you now (see you now)
I just can't believe that we've come to be
So much in love and I'm so lucky
And I'll always be
Sing your heart songs (heart songs, heart songs)
Sing your heart songs (heart songs, heart songs), sing your heart songs
