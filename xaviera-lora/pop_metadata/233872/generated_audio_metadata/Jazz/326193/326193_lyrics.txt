If you don't have trust, you don't have anything
Baby I will let you go if you want to go
If you don't have trust, you don't have anything
Baby I won't stand in your way, it's not my place to make you stay
If you don't have trust, you don't have anything
Baby I will let you go if you want to go
If you don't have trust, you don't have anything
Baby I won't stand in your way
It's not my place to make you stay
If you don't have trust, you don't have anything
Baby I will let you go if you want to go
If you don't have trust, you don't have anything
Baby I won't stand in your way, it's not my place to make you stay
If you don't have trust
You don't have anything
Baby I will let you go if you want to go
If you don't have trust
You don't have anything
Baby I won't stand in your way
It's not my place to make you stay
If you don't have trust
You don't have anything
Baby I will let you go if you want to go
If you don't have trust
You don't have anything
Baby I won't stand in your way
It's not my place to make you stay
If you don't have trust
You don't have anything
Baby I will let you go if you want to go
If you don't have trust
You don't have anything
Baby I won't stand in your way
It's not my place to make you stay
If you don't have trust
You don't have anything
