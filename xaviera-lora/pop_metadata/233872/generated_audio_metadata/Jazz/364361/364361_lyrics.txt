Well if all your lives were money
You know I'd be the richest man alive
Because of all the lies that you gave me
You know I took with my arms open wide
And if every girl I caught you with was your cousin
Your family would build a nation of their own
Your fooling around should make me find another
But I
Can't leave your love alone
That's why I'm sayin'
We ain't goin' nowhere
We're gonna stay up here
You and Don
Don no good showin' show
But when all is said and done
We'll still have our fun, so it's better
The devil let you know
I went to see a fortune teller
And this is what she said to me
A bird in the hand is worth so much more
Than two two-timing birds up in a tree
Oh, is that right? Listen, across town I got a friend, she named Jody
You know when I go up to see her sometimes, you know how it is
But if it wasn't for the money from my pocket, I know, I know
Then Jody would be no friend of mine, that's what I'm saying
We ain't going nowhere
We're gonna stay a fair
You're a dog, oh yeah
We are no good so and so
But when all is said and done
We'll still have our fun
So it's better
The devil that you know
You know we might as well stay together baby
It's better
The devil that you know
I ain't going nowhere, it's better, the devil that you know
