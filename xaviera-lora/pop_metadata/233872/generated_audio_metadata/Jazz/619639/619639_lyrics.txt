All alone, I'm here now just for you
Left all behind, the world that's mine today
To be with you, just to be with you, yeah
There's no turning back now, my darling
There's no turning back, my love
I know that you must be scared
But you gotta let go for the things that you care
No, there's no turning back now, my darling
There's no turning back, my love
I know that you must be scared
But you gotta let go for the things that you care
Oh yeah
Alone, I'm here now, so are you
Left everything in your life that's important to you
To be with me, to be with me
Oh, let's live our life together darling
Let's just live for me and you
We need nobody else
Nobody else for the things
I'm all alone, all alone
