And I, and I, worry, mm-hmm
Changes will come now boy
You're better than your ways
I won't be here hanging round
If you don't stop your rambling days
And you will be missing me
But I won't come again
I say you can find another who'll be creeping undercover
But you'll never find a lover like me
You're not the kind of guy who takes too well to threats
And though you tend to live your life in the happy state of no regrets
I am the finest woman you have ever met
I say you can find another who'll be creeping undercover
But you'll never find a lover like me
Changes will come
Changes will come
Changes will come
Or my love's gonna hit the road
Don't try to slip away
I have you down to rights
And if you lose this woman now
You know you'll never sleep at night
This will be trouble
Like a match to dynamite
I say you can find another who'll be creeping undercover
But you'll never find a lover like me
Changes will come
Changes will come
Changes will come
Or my love's gonna hit the road
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Mm-hmm, changes will come
Boy, you better mend your ways
I won't be here hanging'round
If you don't stop these rambling days
Then you will be missing me
But I won't come again
I say you can find another
Who'll be creeping undercover
But you'll never find a lover like me
Changes will come
Changes will come
Changes will come
Or my love's gonna hit the road
Or my love's gonna hit the road
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La-ba-bee-ba-bee-ba-bee-ba-bee-ba-bee-ba-bee-ba-bee-ba-bee-ba-bee-ba-bee-ba-bee-ba-bee
