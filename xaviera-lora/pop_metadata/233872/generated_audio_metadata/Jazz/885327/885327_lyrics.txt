There's no time for worry
There's no time for sleep
If I had tomorrow
The changes I would keep
life is what you make it
Too precious that we fight
Look up to the sun and
All things will be alright
There's no time for weakness
Be strong with who you are
Those who look to bring you down
They won't get very far
life is what you make it
To precious that we fight
Look up to the sun and
All things will be alright
