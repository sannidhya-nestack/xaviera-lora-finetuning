There's a party in the swamp tonight at Freddy the Frog's pad
A really big shindig swinging his thing that Boggs had
Freddy and his steady march
You're told I'll throw in a bash
There'll be a horse, so BYOB
It'll be a swamp gas
Freddy the Frog's king of the pond'til dawn
He's uninhibited (whoa there)
Rip it up, Freddy the Frog
Joe Mosquito's combo we'll be playin'
Chuck the Flamin' Duck we'll be sashayin'
Vinnie Minnow's skinny dips while Minnie Tadpole does a strip
The Cricket Chicks and the Cattails we'll be swayin'
Freddy the Frog is king of the pond'til dawn
He's uninhibited (rip it) rip it up Freddy the Frog
Freddy the Frog's king of the pond'til dawn
He's uninhibited (who are they?)
Rip it up, Freddy the Frog
One night a reptile slept while the stingers kept on swinging
The crocodile cops couldn't stop all the rocking and the singing
The goose and the gander's hooting out salamanders
The jiggers chug a lug while the slugs cut a rug
The hip-hip-hoppin' is nonstop boppin' is swamping
Freddy the Frog's king of the pond'til dawn
He's uninhibited (who is it?)
Rip it up Freddy the Frog
Ready the frogs, king of the pond'til dawn
He's uninhibited, uninhibited, uninhibited
Rip it up, ready the frogs
