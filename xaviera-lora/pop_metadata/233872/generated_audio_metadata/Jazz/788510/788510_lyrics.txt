Crappy hotel, crappy hotel
Your donuts, your coffee, your smell
Hey, hey, I know you
I've been here before
Déjà vu to the core
And I know what's in store
Before the night is through
Crappy hotel, a crappy hotel
Psycho room with no view, Norman Bates has the flu
And the maid's got a sweet pair of eyes
You'd think that I'd know some better place to go
But money's tight, it's a bullet I bite with my fries
Crappy Hotel
Crappy Hotel
Crappy Hotel
I love you
Crappy hotel, crappy hotel
I'd sooner be a sinner standing at the gates of hell
I've been here before
I've dined on your crap du jour
And I know what's in store
Before the night is through
Crappy hotel, I once again fail
For your discount rated, newly updated lies
You'd think that I'd know some better place to go
But money's tight, it's a bullet I bite with my fries
Crappy Hotel, Crappy Hotel, Crappy Hotel, I love you, I love you
