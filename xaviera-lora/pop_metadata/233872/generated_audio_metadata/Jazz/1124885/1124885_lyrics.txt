Whispers in the night, kisses that delight
Candles burning bright, champagne and flowers
Never dreamed I'd find a one of a kind kind of love
It's so amazing how time flies
Gazing in your eyes
Angel in disguise
With heavenly powers
Cares are left behind
In our one of a kind
Kind of love
Music is playing while heartbeats are saying
We'll stay just the way we are
Now that forever's found us
We'll never lose this love that surrounds us
Dreams that are so real, words that gently heal
Secrets we reveal, just talking for hours
Two hearts intertwined in a one of a kind kind of love
Music is playing while heartbeats are saying
We'll stay just the way we are
Now that forever's found us
We'll never lose this love that surrounds us
Dreams that are so real
Words that gently heal
Secrets we reveal
Just talking for hours
Two hearts intertwined
In a one-of-a-kind kind of love
Never dreamed I'd find
This one of a kind, kind of love
