Over the river and through the woods to grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh through the bright and drifted snow
Over the river and through the woods, oh how the wind does blow
It stings your toes and bites your nose as over the ground we go
Over the river and through the woods to have a day of play
Hear the bell ring, ting-a-ling-a-ling, it's a Thanksgiving day
Over the river and through the woods, trot past my dappled grey
A spring on the ground like a haunting hound, it's a Thanksgiving day
Over the river and through the woods
To grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh through the bright and drifted snow
Over the river and through the woods, oh how the wind does blow
It stings your toes and bites your nose as over the ground we go
Over the ground we go
Happy Thanksgiving don't you know
