You're killing me
Your royal highness is chilling me
Unwilling me
I wish I understood why
You're chilling me
You're nowhere close to fulfilling me
Or instilling in me
Ideas of falling in love
Believe me, you are heading for a catastrophe
Can't you see, you're acting like a kitten climbing up a tree
I have to tell you honestly, I've got to go'cause you're killing me
Just leave me be, I really have to be free
You're killin' me!
