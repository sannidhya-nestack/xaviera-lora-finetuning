No matter what they say, nothing brings me down
But I know, but I know, but I know it's too late
No matter what they say, nothing brings me down
But I know, but I know, but I know it's too late
(Outro)
No matter what they say nothing brings me down
But I know, but I know, but I know it's too late
No matter what they say nothing brings me down
But I know, but I know, but I know it's too late
(Outro)
