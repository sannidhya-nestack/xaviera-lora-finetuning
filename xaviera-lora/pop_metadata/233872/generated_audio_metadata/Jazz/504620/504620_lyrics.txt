I never knew there could be someone like you
Then you walked into my life
Nothing's the same, all the rest is just a game
Since you walked into my life
The moon and stars at night
They blaze with light when you appear
The empty feeling dies
My spirits rise
Darling when you are near
Are you what you seem
Or is this a lovely dream
Are you really in my life
I couldn't see that love had plans for me
Then you walked into my life
Everything's changed
My whole world's been rearranged
Since you walked into my life
My world's a different hue
No longer blue
Since I found you
I see you as you are
A golden star
That could rival the sun
Are you what you seem
Or is this a lovely dream
Are you really in my life?
Are you really in my life?
