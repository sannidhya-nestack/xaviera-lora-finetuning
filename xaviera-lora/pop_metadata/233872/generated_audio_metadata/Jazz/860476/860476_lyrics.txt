I paint my tight jeans on
A little Mona Lisa smile
Been out of action way too long
Now I'm coming back in style
Got my swagger to a tee
Been rehearsing every step
When that spotlight shines on me
Tonight I'm gonna knock'em dead
I'm feeling sassy
Got a stretched out attitude
Oh, so sassy
I'm in a Razzmatazzy mood
I'm top hat classy
Raisin' cane and kickin' high
And sassy gets what sassy wants tonight
I can sizzle when I'm hot
Watch me tease across the floor
But I won't show'em all I've got
I like to leave'em wanting more
I'm feeling sassy
Got a stretched up attitude
Oh, so sassy
I'm in a razzmatazzin' mood
I'm top hat classy
Raisin' cane and kickin' high
And sassy gets what sassy wants tonight
I'm top hat classy
Raisin' cane and kickin' out
And sassy gets what sassy wants tonight
