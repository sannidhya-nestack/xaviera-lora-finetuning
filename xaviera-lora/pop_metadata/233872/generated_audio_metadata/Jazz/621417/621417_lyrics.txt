Close your eyes and count to ten
I left my arms around you then
I left you the way I found you
And I don't know if I'll ever see you again
Troubles come and troubles go
Tell me something that I don't know
Left here
With an empty space
And there's nobody
To take your place
Love of mine, sweet love of mine
My love loved you, and gladly too
And I wanna stay right madly in love with you
Once you held me in your arms
And you fooled me with your charms
Love of mine, why do you torment me?
Yes, I know as hard as it is that you left me
That you left me in a mess like this
And I loved you, yeah
I loved you so gladly
Oh, love of mine
