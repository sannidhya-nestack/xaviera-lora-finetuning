You're the cream in my coffee
You're the salt in my stew
You'll always be my necessity
I'd be lost without you
You're the starch in my color
You're the lace in my shoe
You'll always be my necessity
I'd be lost without you
You do do do do do do do do do do do
You do do do do do do do do do
You're the cream in my coffee
You're the salt in my stew
You'll always be my necessity
I'd be lost without you
You're the starch in my collar
You're the lace in my shoe
You'll always be my necessity
I'd be lost without you
You the do-do-do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do
You the do-do-do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do
Most men tell love tales, and each phrase dovetails
You've heard each known way, this way is my own way
You're the sailor, my love boat, you're the captain and crew
You'll always be my necessity, I'd be lost without you
You're the sailor in my love boat
You're the captain and crew
You'll always be my necessity
Like a restaurant with a recipe
You're the lace in my shoe
I'd be lost without you
