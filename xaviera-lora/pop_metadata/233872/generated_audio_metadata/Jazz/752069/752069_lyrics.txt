It might seem you've been stranded on this dead end so long
If you dream you're half crazy, you're only half wrong
But you don't need to thank me, it's the least I could do
Just consider it compliments of the blues
You just sleep on the floor
You don't answer the phone
When I ring you pretend
Like there's nobody home
But my cart by the door
I slip it under and through
It's your invite
Compliment of the blues
I hate life, gets darker with each new day
But you just watch while the new day drifts away
Down a ways you can hear people laugh, people shout
Maybe someday you'll have something to smile about
But for now you're a recluse behind all your dues
But you'll pay them off compliments of the blues
I hear life gets brighter with each new day
But you just watch while the new day drifts away
I read Adam and Eve
Had their own paradise
But with one bite of the apple
They both paid the price
Adam said, "If we blew it"
It's sad but that's the truth
Just consider them compliments of the blues
Just consider them compliments of the blue
