Chemistry, you and me
Blend together cosmically
It's basic elementary chemistry
We mix and match so naturally
One part you and one part me
In two heart harmony
It's chemistry
When we combine this with a helium kiss
No mountain we can't rise above
Like passionate mad scientists
We discover we're in love
Magnetically compatible
We never push, we only pull
Connected at the soul, it's chemistry
When we combine this with a helium kiss
No mountain we can't rise above
Like passionate mad scientists
We discover we're in love
Of chemistry, you and me
Blend together cosmically
It's basic elementary chemistry
The only explanation, chemistry
Chemistry, chemistry, chemistry, chemistry
