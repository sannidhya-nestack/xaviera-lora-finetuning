You know I'd do anything for you, baby
I'd walk a thousand miles
Go to the ends of the earth
Because it's worth all the trouble
When I see that I've made you smile
What more can I do?
Baby, I love you
But there's one thing that you gotta see
Oh, it makes me tired
When I see that you ain't doing nothing
For me
I work every day for you baby
To make things easy for you
I work my fingers to the bone
To make this house a happy home
That's the reason I'm working for
What more can I do?
Baby I love you
But there's one thing that you gotta see
Oh it makes me tired when I see that you ain't doing nothing
For me
Oh I don't know how much more that I can take
My heart is breaking and I'm feeling like such a fool
Why do you have to treat me so cruel?
Oh, oh, yeah
You know I'd do anything for you baby
I'd walk a thousand miles
Go to the ends of the earth
Because it's worth all the trouble
When I see that I've made you smile
What more can I say
I do
Baby I love you
But there's one thing that you gotta see
Woah it makes me tired when I see
That you ain't doing nothing for me
It makes me so tired when I see
That you ain't doing nothing for me
Yeah I ain't doing nothing babe
