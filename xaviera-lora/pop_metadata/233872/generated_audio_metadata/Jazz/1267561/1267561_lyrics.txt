You've heard all about your raggy melodies
Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna wing you through and through
There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be singing it to beat the band
Now you've heard of your will-o'-the-wisp
But give a little listen to this
It goes cha-da, cha-da, cha-da, cha-ta, cha-da, jing, jing, jing
Cha-da, cha-da-cha-da-cha-da-ching-ching-ching
That's a funny little bit of melody
It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes cha-da, cha-da-cha-da cha-da-cha-da-ching-ching
You've heard all about your raggy melodies
Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through
There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be singing it to beat the band
Now you've heard of your will-o'-the-wisp
But give a little listen to this
It goes jada jada jada jada jada jing jing jing
Jada, jada, jada, jada, jing, jing, jing
That's a funny little bit of melody
It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes jada, jada, jada, jada jada, jing, jing, jing
Jada, jada, jing, jing, jing
Jada jada jing jing
Funny little bit of melody
It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes
Jada jada jada jada jing jing jing
