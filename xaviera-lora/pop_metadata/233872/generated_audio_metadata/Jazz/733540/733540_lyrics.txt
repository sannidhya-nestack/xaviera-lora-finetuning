Leave your baggage off my train
et your past, et your pain
Chuck your trunk of memories if you wanna chug with me
Leave your baggage off my train
This is where your exes get off
Push'em out and let'em get lost
Stash'em on a one-way crash-bound plane
Let'em all go up in old flames
Leave your baggage off the train
et your past, et your pain
Chug your chunk of memories if you wanna chug with me
Leave your baggage off my train
I'll be your porter, let me give you a tip
We're gonna travel light on this trip
There's no room on my pullman for yesterday's nightmares
No room on my track for old ties
Leave your baggage off my train
et your past, et your pain
Chunky trunk of memories if you wanna chuck with me
Leave your baggage off my train
Leave your baggage off my train
et your past, et your pain
Chunk your chunk of memories if you wanna chug with me
Leave your baggage off my train
Chunk your chunk of memories if you wanna chug with me
Leave your baggage off my train
