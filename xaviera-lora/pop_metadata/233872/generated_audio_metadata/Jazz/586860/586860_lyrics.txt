It's only natural the way things are
That we should meet beneath a shooting star
And folks can see you belong to me
And with your eyes you put a spell on my heart
Remaining constant to the one ideal
Inconsequential things become so real
And by a chance encounter grow to excess
With its word, amour express
Express amour
Can never define what I've become
Now you are mine each night
I earnestly pray that you will never ever stray
Express amour
Faithful and true, contains the essence of love that's new when we meet
I'll explain, express some more to you
Although a million stars caress the night
As long as you are here and hold me tight
And from our hearts will be born
A love that embraces the dawn
Express amour can never define
What I've become now you are mine
It's night, I earnestly pray that you will
Never ever stray, express amour
Faithful and true
Contains the essence of love
That's new when we meet
I'll explain, I'll express some more to you
Express amour can never define
What I've become, now you are mine, it's night
I earnestly pray that you will never ever stray
Express amour
Faithful and true, contains the essence of love that's new when we meet
I'll explain, express some more to you, to you
