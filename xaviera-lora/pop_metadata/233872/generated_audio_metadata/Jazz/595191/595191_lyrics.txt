Anything is possible on a night like this
Anything is possible
Close your eyes make a wish
There's paisley clouds against a freckled sky
I don't know how and I don't know why
We ran so fast we started to fly
Cause anything is possible
Baby, you'll see
Anything is possible
Come with me
Anything is possible
On a night like this
Anything is possible
Close your eyes make a wish
The hands of time have had a beckon call
We'll laugh at fate and smash his crystal ball
We'll reach for the stars and we'll touch them all
anything is possible
And baby you'll see
Anything is possible, come with me
Anything is possible
Anything is possible
