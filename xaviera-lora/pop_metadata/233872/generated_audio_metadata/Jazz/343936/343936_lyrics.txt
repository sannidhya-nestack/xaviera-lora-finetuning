In my dreams I made plans for us
Made a home for us, made a life for us
After waking up there was no room for us
So today I had to change my plans
There never was another man
Who made me start to plan
Counting all the days it ran
But then it came to me like a heavy load on me
So today I had to change my plans
Somewhere inside you
I know you cared
But that wasn't enough for life
And when I found you
I hoped you were my future
But I had to close that book today
I walk the streets today and since you turned away
Your face lives in everything I see
And it won't stop haunting me
Though I tried with all my might, I have no hope left in sight
So today I had to change my plans
Somewhere inside you, I know you cared
But that wasn't enough for life
And when I found you, I hoped you were my future
But I had to close that book today
I walk the streets today
And since you turned away
Your face lives in everything I see
And it won't stop haunting me
Though I tried with all my might, I have no hope left in sight
So today I had to change my plans
