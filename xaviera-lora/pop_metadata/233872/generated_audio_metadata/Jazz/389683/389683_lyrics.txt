Looking back
All the little things I did
When I was young
No I can't agree with each and every one
They seem
So far
I can see
Every road I took no matter high or low
On the path to meet you everywhere I'd go
Though near or far
Take
My hand as we walk on
Never to regret the words of days long gone
For lack of better words
I wouldn't risk the burden I have in hand
Though the charm might be the second time around
But I know anywhere else back then
And I wouldn't be with you right now
Take my hand as we walk on
Never to regret the words of days long gone
For lack of better words
I wouldn't give the bird I haven't had
Though the charm might be the second time around
Cause I know anywhere else back then
And I wouldn't be with you right now
Cause I know anywhere else back then
And I wouldn't be with you right now
