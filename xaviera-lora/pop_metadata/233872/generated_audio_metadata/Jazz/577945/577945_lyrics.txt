Uh-huh
Moving into nowhere
Thinking of the past
I wanna go right to you
To talk about this mess
Put all my love to the test
Moving up the ladder baby
One wrong at a time
Don't put it off'til later
And we might be out of time
I'll surrender my whole heart
If you will let me see your soul
Can I feel you? Can I touch you?
Or are you afraid that I might go?
Tell me through my eyes you love me
Or otherwise I'll never know
Can't control my heartbeat babe
When you're on my mind
I've been hurting so long
Make it rain this time
It's time to make more music
Just like we used to do
It doesn't take much practice
We were so in town
I'll surrender my whole heart
If you will let me see your soul
Can I feel you, can I touch you?
Or do you think that I might go?
Tell me do my eyes you love me
Or otherwise I'll never know
Sometimes you trust your feelings inside
Give it a month and you'll change your mind
We're both too tough to stay behind
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll surrender my whole heart
If you'll let me see your soul
Can I feel you? Can I touch you?
Or do you think that I might go? Well
Tell me to my eyes you love me
Or otherwise I'll never know, well
I surrender baby, you know I'll win
Oh girl, just tell me to my eyes darling
Oh baby, nothing wrong
I surrender
