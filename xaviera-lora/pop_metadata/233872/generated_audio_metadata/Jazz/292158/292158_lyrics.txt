We ain't got nothing to worry about
We won't be due in time
The cops ain't never gonna figure it out
It was the perfect crime
I grabbed the gold and I'm here to say
That we made a clean getaway
And we got nothing
We got nothing to worry about
I left no fingerprints on the gun
The witness can't say a word
I tripped the fire alarm just for fun
I tell you nobody heard
Just be cool man and don't freak out
We had a plan and it was well thought out
And we've got nothing
We've got nothing to worry about
We ain't got nothing to worry about
We can beat the rap
I won't say nothing to ride us out
Don't fail the polygraph
A trench coat makes a quick disguise
And if they catch you just act surprised
And we've got nothing
We've got nothing to worry about
We ain't got nothing to worry about
They wouldn't hear our plea
Now they got us where we can't get out
They threw away the key
But Jagged Edge makes a perfect knife
When you're facing ninety-nine to life
And we've got nothing
We've got nothing to worry about (yes we do)
Hear what I say
We've got nothing
We've got nothing to worry about
