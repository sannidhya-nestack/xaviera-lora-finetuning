Who knows when the sun will flicker and burn out
Cosmic dust cast about
Now that's a cold day
The laughing booty he knows
The day the world will land
Rub his pot bellies in
Go on and ask away
Ask him why
They say the end is near
Go on and ask him about all the pain and the doubt and the fear
How long will the sun
Flicker and burn
The hardest lesson to learn
Is the one you know
But the booty he laughs
When you look in his eyes
his love never dies
His love never dies
Ask him why they say the end is near
Go on and ask him about all your pain and your doubt and your fear
How long will the sun for liquor and burn
The hardest lesson to learn
Is the one you know
I bought the booty he laughs
When you look in his eyes
his love never dies
His love never dies
