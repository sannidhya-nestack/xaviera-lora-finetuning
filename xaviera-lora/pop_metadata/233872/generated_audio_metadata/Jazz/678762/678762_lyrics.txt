Lying awake at 3am, a victim of that peace thief
Hands on my chest, mumble soothing words
To poor heart pounding underneath
Try to calm my breathing yeah
Tell pulse not to leave
Waiting for the sun to rise
So I can sleep
Loud and wake at 4 am
Angry words thrash in my head
Can't find a pretty picture
Just your glaring face
Keeps me prisoner in this stone bed
Brain is now my enemy, yeah
No thoughts I wanna keep
Waiting for the birds to sing
So I can sleep
I'm a child in the dark
No one answers my call
The night is looming long
Nothing at all so small
So small
So small
Still awake at 6am
Body shaking from the night
Crank will surrender
No more strength to give
Searchin' windows for the light
Finally pink of daybreak, yeah
Hear the sparrow's tweet
I sink into the soft world
So I can't sleep
I can't sleep
Do-da, do-da, do-da, do-do-da, do-do-da, do, do-da, do-da, do, do-da
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba
