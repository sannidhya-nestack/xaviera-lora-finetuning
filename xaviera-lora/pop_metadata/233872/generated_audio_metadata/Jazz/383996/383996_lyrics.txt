The fool and his heart will soon be parted
The fool ends up so broken hearted
Now I've been happy
To the golden rule
But I wound up playing the worst kind of fool
When you made the scene all my troubles started
I had good sense but it soon departed
You turned me on then you said goodbye
Don't know why you wanna make your baby cry
Well honey when I met you
Sweet love blinded me
Even with the toast so clear
I didn't want to say no, no, no, no
I didn't want to see
A fool and his heart will soon be parted
And I may wind up broken hearted
But the good times make up for the blues
For your sweet love and I break all the rules
Now honey when I met you
Sweet love blinded me
Even with a coat so clear
I didn't want to say no, no, no, no
I didn't want to see
The fool and his heart will soon be parted
And I may wind up broken hearted
But good times make up for the blues
For your sweet loving I'd break all the rules
For your sweet lovin' I'd break all the rules
The fool and his heart will soon be parted
The fool ends up so broken hearted
And now I'm in hell through the golden rule
But I wound up playing the worst kind of fool
The worst kind of fool
The worst kind of fool
The worst kind of fool, the worst kind of fool
