There's the door, baby, why don't you use it?
And don't look back, darling, just keep on walking
Gave you my love, but you misused it
Don't wanna see your face no more
Don't wanna see your face no more
No, I don't wanna see your face no more
I don't wanna see your face no more
And don't look back darling, just keep on walking
You ain't no good for me, ain't no, ain't no good for me
Boy can't you see that baby you're no good for me
You ain't no good for me, ain't, no, ain't no good for me
You good for nothing, and baby it's plain to see
You ain't no good for me, ain't, no, ain't no good for me
Boy can't you see that baby you're no good for me
You ain't no good for me, ain't, no, ain't no good for me
You good for nothing, and baby it's plain to see
Don't look at me that way'cause it's over baby
And I ain't coming back no more
Don't look to me for sympathy
She ain't knocking on your door
You had me and threw me down
I ain't crying your name no more
And that is why it's over baby
And I am showing you the door
You ain't no good for me, ain't no, ain't no good for me
Boy can't you see that baby you're no good for me
You ain't no good for me, ain't no, ain't no good for me
You good for nothing, and baby it's plain to see
You ain't no good for me, ain't no, ain't no good for me
Boy can't you see that baby you're no good for me
You ain't no good for me, ain't no, ain't no good for me
You good for nothing, and baby it's plain to see
Try this
But you didn't listen
I tried that
But there was something missing
I tried this
But it wasn't me you were kissing
I tried that
I'm done with all your dissing
I tried this
But you didn't listen
I tried that
But there was something missing
I tried this
But it wasn't me you were kissing
I tried that
I'm done with all your dissing
You ain't no good for me, ain't no, ain't no good for me
Boy can't you see that baby you're no good for me
You ain't no good for me, ain't, no, ain't no good for me
You good for nothing, and baby it's plain to see
You ain't no good for me, ain't now, ain't no good for me
Boy can't you see that baby you're no good for me
You ain't no good for me, ain't, no, ain't no good for me
You good for nothing, and baby it's plain to see
