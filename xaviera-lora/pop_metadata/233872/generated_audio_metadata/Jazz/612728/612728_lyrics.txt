Sally, Sally, bride of our alley
You're more than the whole world to me
Sally, Sally, don't ever wander away
From the alley and me
When skies are grey you keep smiling
Your looks to me are beguiling
I love you Sally, Sally, Sally
Marry me Sally and happy forever we'll be
Sally, Sally, pride of our alley
You're more than the whole world to me
Sally, Sally, don't ever wander away
From our Harley and me
When skies are grey you keep smiling
Your looks to me
I'll be calling, I love you Sally
Sally, Sally, marry me Sally
And happy forever we'll be
Yes happy forever we'll be
