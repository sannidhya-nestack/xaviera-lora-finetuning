Take care of your heart
Especially now that we're apart
Oh, it's a break up
And it's a lesson to be learned
Still trying to make up
Bridges that are burned that will lead me back to your heart
Seventeen million miles apart
From where I'm standing
The grass ain't looking no greener
Crimes of the heart ain't just misdemeanors
You can't et if only I
Could go back in time to that first dance with you
I made this romance stronger than fire
One second chance might fall from the sky
Oh from the sky
And maybe we could give it one more try
And I know that one love song
Won't make up for I've done you wrong
Oh, but take it hard and never et me
I'll make it up
If only you let me take care of your heart, baby, take care
Hold out your heart
Don't let nobody
Even break your heart
Like I broke yours and you broke mine, oh
Darling, take care of your heart, baby, take care
Of your heart
Don't let nobody ever break your heart
Like I broke yours and you broke mine
Mmm, take care of your heart
Baby, take care of your heart
Take care of your heart
