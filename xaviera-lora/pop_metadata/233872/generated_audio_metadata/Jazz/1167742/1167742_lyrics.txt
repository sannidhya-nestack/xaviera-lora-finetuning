Sundays we don't have to go to work for bread
We can stay in bed until those funny papers are read
And then like you do you ask me where do I wanna go
And then I shrug and go and say I don't know where do you wanna go
Well how about Venus
It's that little cafe with the crooked door
How'bout Saturn's?
I hear they open up at noon
Or if you're in a hurry there's always the moon
With those pies that are to die for
But right now I've got an insatiable appetite for you
But don't worry dear (don't worry dear)
I won't bite off more than I can chew
You always ask me where do I wanna go
Well how about anywhere with you
Yes I know anywhere it's where my seat is taken
Anywhere is where our love was making
If you stay by my side we will eventually find our way
Because you and I belong at the Anywhere Cafe
So if I hear you right
And we stay up all night
You'll go anywhere with me
When we decide to get up
Or we could stay right here where anywhere
Is where I wanna be
Let's cover up
And not go out so hastily
Let's go to Venus
It's that little cafe with the crooked door
How'bout Saturn's?
I heard they open up at noon
Or if you're in a hurry there is always the moon
With those pies that are to die for
But right now I've got an insatiable appetite for you
But don't worry dear (don't worry dear)
I won't bite off more than I can chew
You always ask me where do I wanna go
Well how about anywhere with you
I think coffee in bed sounds like music to my ears
I think it's bloom with you
It's gonna stir me just fine
So how'bout we make some plans
For later on today
No shirts, no shoes required
Happy anywhere, cafe
We can go to Venus
It's that little cafe here with the crooked door
Or how about Saturn's?
You know I think they open up at noon
Or if you're in a hurry there is always the moon
With those pies that are to die for
But right now I've got an insatiable appetite for you
But don't worry dear (don't worry dear)
I won't bite off more than I can chew
You always ask me where do I wanna go
Well how about anywhere?
How about anywhere?
Well how about anywhere with you?
