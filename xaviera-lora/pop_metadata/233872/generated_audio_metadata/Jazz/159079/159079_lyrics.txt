I'm gratified that you came
Now I'm one quite satisfied dame
I'm glad you made it snappy
And made me so happy and tame
I'll testify to that and I won't be shy around you
There's no middle ground when you woo
You're so electrifying and I really like your tattoo
Ooh how do you do when you kiss me it's never enough
You don't dismiss me when you've done your stuff
Your kind of loving fits like a glove
Cause it ain't no Sunday kind of love
So listen I won't give you no guff
And I'll do without all the fluff
I've really got to tell you,'cause it can't be denied
The truth is I'm gratified
I won't give you no guff
And I'll do without all the fluff
I've really got to tell you
I simply can't be denied
How undignified
The truth is I'm stupefied
Don't spread it around
Other guys are disqualified
Sorry, men like him should be sanctified
Really, it's so nice to be gratified
