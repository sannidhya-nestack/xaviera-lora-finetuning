Life is strange
Its meaning escapes me
It don't love me
It hates me
Life is strange
Life is strange
It's hellos and goodbyes
It's promises and lies
Life is strange
It's mysteries and histories
I can never untwine
It's ups and downs and turnarounds
I'm missing
Of my mind
Life is strange
When love's been won and lost
You have to pay the cost
Life is strange
It's mysteries and histories
I can never untwine
It's ups and downs
And turnarounds are messing up my mind
Life is strange
When love's been won and lost
You have to pay the cost
Life is strange
Life is strange
Life is strange
