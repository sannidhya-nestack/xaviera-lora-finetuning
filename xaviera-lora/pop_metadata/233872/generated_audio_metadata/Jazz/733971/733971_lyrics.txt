Oh yeah! I like that groove.
Those great lakes up in Michigan
Fish all day then fish again
On a North Star wish again
That's what I like about the North
Pierogies, hoagies, pretzel carts
Cheese steaks, clam bakes, Reggie bars
There's Camden Yards, Fenway Park
That's what I like about the North
We got diners and delicatessen
Stuffin' is stuffin', it ain't dressin'
Catholic Church is for confessin'
That's what I like about the North
Cooperstown, Niagara Falls, The Garden, Carnegie Hall

Play football in two feet of snow, Lambeau Field and Ten Below
And if folks don't like you, you will know, that's what I like about the North
There's Harlem Jazz, Chicago Blues, Motown Soul and Jersey Bruce
Prince and the Revolution, that's what I like about the North
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
The Siskel-Liebert L train, Chicago-Hope-O'Hara planes
The toast of Illinois, champagne, that's what I like about the North
Iowa's field of dreams, soda fountains and egg creams
And the Braves ain't America's team, and that's what I like about the North
The Cincinnati, three-way chili, corner doo-wop up in Philly
The McDuckins say, "Hey Willie," that's what I like about the North
How about the Indians in Ohio and the Vikings up in Minnesota
Very tired and boring road, that's what I like about the Lord
There's the UN, NYU, OTB and LT2, NYPD Blue
That's what I like about the North
Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan, Islands, Ellis, Longstaten
Little bit of this, little bit of that
And that's what I like about the North
Knicks, Rangers, Giants, Yankees, Northern Ralph
Alfalfa, Spanky, Hoboken was the home of Frankie
That's what I like about the North
How'bout the devil dogs, ringdings?
Hell, I can't get enough of them buffalo wings
Joey by the Foucault, by the boom, by the beam
That's what I like about the North Carolina
Wow wow, wow wow, wow wow
The Gottis and the Corleones
Hard salami and provolone
We don't eat Christmas dinner at Shoney's
And that's what I like about the North
We don't fix the dew, we just do it
When it snows we drive right through it
We smoke tobacco, we don't put to it
That's what I like about the North
And we drink Heineken and Becks
Not Budweiser or Longnecks
We don't ask for separate checks
And that's what I like about the North
And we eat walnuts, not pralines
And my mama didn't have me at seventeen
And all my neighbors have different genes
That's what I like about the North
And there's New York City playing a cherry and we give folks rides
We don't carry'em, we love our cousins, but we don't marry'em, that's right
There's the Hamptons in Hyannis Port
Patrick Ewing and Michael Jordan
And NASCAR racing ain't no sport
And that's what I like about the North
Sacks a sack and a bag's a bag
We won the war but we don't brag
We salute just one flag
That's what I like about the North
Hallelujah (The coming of the Lord)
(His truth is our kingdom)
Now we're not saying that the North is better
It's just cooler, bring a sweater
Meet a Brooklyn chick and you'll never et her
That's what I like about the North
So pack up, you haul, y'all come see
You can bring the whole family
But don't tell no one you know me
That's what I like about the North
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
