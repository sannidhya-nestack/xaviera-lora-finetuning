Shades of blue, if I can't have you
I will walk alone in the early dawn
Now that you are gone
Just a fantasy of what cannot be
When the day is done
Just a table set for one
Lonely, I live without your touch
I'm missing you so much
A rhyme without a reason
A time without a season
A fade to black and shades of blue
Where there once were two
A simple history
The tale of you and me
An unsolved mystery
Just a memory
That will never be
When the day is done
Just a table set for one
Shades of blue
If I can't have you
I will walk alone
In the early dawn
Now that you have gone
Just a fantasy
Of what cannot be
When the day is done
Just a table set for one
Lonely I live without your touch
I'm missing you so much
A rhyme without a reason
A time without a season
A fade to black and shades of blue
Where there once were two
A simple history
The tale of you and me
An unsolved mystery
Just a memory
That will never be
When the day is done
Just a table set for one
Shades of blue, me and you
Shades of blue
