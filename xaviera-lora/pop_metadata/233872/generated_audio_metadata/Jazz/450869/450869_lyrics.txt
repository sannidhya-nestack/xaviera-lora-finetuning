The taste of honey on my tongue
Doesn't last for very long
But when I'm all alone
I think of what we've done
And I can feel you in my bones again
I don't mind when the sky turns grey
I won't cry if you walk away
Just tell me lies'til dawn
So that when you're gone
I can feel you in my bones again
Love is not the only reason
For a brief and dark liaison
We don't need excuses to be here
In my world I'll let you stay
For forever or just a day
And when I've had my fill
I'll thank you for the thrill
Close my eyes and feel you in my bones again
Again
