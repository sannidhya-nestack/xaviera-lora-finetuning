Cheatin' on me, baby, cheatin' on me
You're not the kind of a baby I thought you would be
I trusted you and thought that you'd be true
Because my love was so strong that I went along
Never dreamin' that you'd do me wrong
Love is a game that I played on the square
That you're not the kind who could ever play fair
Cheatin' on me, baby, cheatin' on me
You're not the kind of a baby I thought you would be
I trusted you and thought that you'd be true
Because my love was so strong that I went along
Never dreamin' that you'd do me wrong
Love is a game that I play on the square
But you're not the kind who could ever play fair
I may ive baby sure as you live
Someday you're gonna be sorry
Because you cheated on me
Someday you're gonna be sorry
Because you cheated on me
Yeah, love is a game that I play on the square
But you're not the kind who could ever play fair
