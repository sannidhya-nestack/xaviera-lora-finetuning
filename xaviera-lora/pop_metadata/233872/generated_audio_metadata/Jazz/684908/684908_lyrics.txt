Monday, I'm going nowhere
Tuesday, ain't getting better
Wednesday, you know nothing is fine
Thursday, I see some sunshine
Friday, a little good time
Saturday, you're here and everything's fine
But Sunday morning comes and, babe, it's a new day
When you're right here in my arms
My Sunday morning with you, babe, it's never the same
I wish we could stay like this
Because Monday
Going nowhere Tuesday
And getting better Wednesday
You know nothing is fine
Thursday see some sunshine
Friday little good time
Saturday you're here and everything's fine
But Sunday morning comes and baby it's a new day
When you're right here in my arms
My Sunday morning with you, babe, it's never the same
I wish we could stay like this because, oh
Monday, oh no, Tuesday, oh no, Wednesday, you know, nothing is fine
Thursday, I know
Friday, I know
Saturday, you're here and everything's fine
My Sunday morning with you, babe, it's never the same
I wish we could stay like this because of
Monday, oh no, Tuesday, oh no, Wednesday, you know nothing is fine
Thursday, oh no
Friday, oh no
Saturday, you're here
Everything's fine
Everything's fine
Everything's fine
Everything's fine
