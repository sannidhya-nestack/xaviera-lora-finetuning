I bet your smile looks like sunshine
Won't you throw me a lifeline
I put a dime in the jukebox
If you give me one dance
I won't be no trouble
My intentions are noble
Baby, please give me a chance
I'm sure you've been warned of strangers
The possible dangers
But I thought I saw loneliness
Deep in your eyes
I've known that emotion
Nearly drowned in that ocean
The last time my romance capsized
Though my looks may not show it
I got the heart of a poet
I never have been really all that good with words
But when my heart starts to tumble
My lips start to stumble
And what's inside never gets heard
What do you think now?
Can I buy you one drink now?
You can tell me your troubles
In between the sips
I won't act too distracted
Though Lord knows I'm attracted
To the sensuous curves of your lips
