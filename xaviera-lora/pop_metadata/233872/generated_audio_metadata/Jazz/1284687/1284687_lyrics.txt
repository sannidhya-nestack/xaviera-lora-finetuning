Can my love for you be measured in a dandelion's flight?
And why do beings insist upon the darkness of night?
And if the rings of love could be counted like the life of
A tree
Would it make what you're feeling
Any sweeter for me?
And would we do it again
If we knew where or when love would lead us?
But like a dandelion's flight
In the darkness of night
Love took command
Love held our hand
So let's give love a chance
And let's make romance
Because it would be tragic
To lose this sweet magic
That we know so well
So let's just close the door
And make love like we made before
And like a dandelion's flight
In the darkness of night
Let's fly away
Let's fly away today
