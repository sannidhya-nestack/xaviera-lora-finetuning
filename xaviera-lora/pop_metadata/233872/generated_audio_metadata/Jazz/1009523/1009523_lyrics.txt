I know a place where it's safe and warm
I know a place where it's safe from the storm
And I know you know it's in my arms
I know you know how much I love you
No one in this world could ever take the place of you
So hold me closely till the end of time
People change just like seasons do
They ride the wind
They just don't know how deep
Still waters run so true and pure
People travel near and far, some spend their whole lives
Trying to find a love that's just like ours
And I hope they find a love like I have with you
People change just like seasons do
They ride the wind
They just don't know how deep still waters run
So true and pure
I know a place where it's safe and warm
I know a place where it's safe from the storm
And I know you
It's in my arms
