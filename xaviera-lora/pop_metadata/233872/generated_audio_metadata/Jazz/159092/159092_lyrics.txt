When heavy decisions come up I don't have to think twice
I'm so together and Landers writes me for advice
When world leaders get in a mess
I'm the expert they always request
What can I say I was born that way
Calm, cool and collected
In a car or a plane, at home on the street, on the job
Whatever comes up I can handle with dispatch, no prop
No matter how bumpy the ride, I take every part all in stride
For me nothing's hard, on my business card it says calm, cool and collected
Verbal abuse leaves me mostly just mildly amused
Tell me to jump in the lake, I just smile and refuse
I know how to pull out a plane when it pitches and rolls
When he's in a tight spot, Chuck Yeager hands me the controls
He knows when he's in a jam
To call on the better man
Nothing's too tough when you've got the right stuff
And you're calm, cool and collective
Princess Diana felt no one was charming as me
If I weren't so modest I guess I'd be forced to agree
With ten seconds left in a game but one basket will win
The crowd has no doubt as to which one the coach will put in
I dribble, pivot, and set
As my impossible shot clears the net
The crowd goes berserk when I go to work
So calm, cool, and collected
Hello? Oh, Shaq? Sure, I could help you with your free throws
For starters, a little more arc would help
Look, I have a drill I think you'll love
I'll see you on Tuesday
Hello? Oh, hi Tiger! Uh-huh. Tiger, I've taught you everything I know. Obviously, you listened.
