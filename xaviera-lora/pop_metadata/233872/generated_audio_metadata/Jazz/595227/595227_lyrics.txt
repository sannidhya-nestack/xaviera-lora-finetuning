I ain't got time for you
No, I ain't got time for you
I'm late for a date
Got a lot on my plate
Got too much to do
You best get out of my way
I've had a hell of a day
And I ain't got time for you
I'm busy, don't you know
I got a seat behind Jack in the second row
I'm on the go, go, go
I'm a who's who, who
And I ain't got time for you
No, I ain't got time
If you got something I need
I'll look you up, yes indeed
Other than that, we're through
If we were friends long ago I hate to tell you so
But really it's true
I ain't got, ain't got, ain't got time for you
I ain't got time for you
No, I ain't got time for you
Even my mom and dad and my best buddy Brad make appointments too
You can talk to the hand to get the lay of the land
I ain't got time for you
I'm busy, don't you know
I got a seat for hot jack in the second row
I'm on the go, go, go
I'm a who's who, who
And I ain't got time for you
No, I ain't got time for you
I ain't got time
No, I ain't got time
No, I ain't got time
I ain't got time for you
