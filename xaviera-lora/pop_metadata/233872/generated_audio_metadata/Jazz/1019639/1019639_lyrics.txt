Table for two
And I see the rain is falling down
Coffee keeps me cozy and warm
Till my love comes around
Waiting for you
Taking little sips to pass the time
My bitter bad heart beats
Knowing that soon you'll be mine
Through the door, across the floor
All I want's you up here
And it's like a dream you are here
Here by your side
That's the only place I want to be
With the rain drops falling outside
And you next to me
Through the door, across the floor
All at once you appear
And it's like a dream you are here
Here by your side
That's the only place I want to be
With the rain drops falling outside
And you next to me
