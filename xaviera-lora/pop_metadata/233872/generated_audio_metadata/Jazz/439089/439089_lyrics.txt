We live in troubled times
Worried hearts and worried minds
Just look forward, can't look back
Guess I'm feeling vulnerable
I know, I know, I know we still care
And I really should be there
Too much love, so much pain
You're suffering little one, little one
You know I love you
When you're feeling low
Nowhere else to go
I don't want to fight
Spill my blood or lose my life
Need something to hang on to
Someone like you
I got to be more positive
I know, I know, I know
I never really tried
I can't go on living this life
Too much love, so much pain
You're suffering, little one, little one
You know I love you
When you're feeling low, nowhere else to go
Baby, baby, baby, please don't cry
I've seen the light and won the fight
At a time like this, I had to take the risk
I'm coming home, little one, little one
You know I love you (I love you, I love you, I love you)
Little one, little one
You know I love you (I love you, you, you, you)
When you're feeling low
Nowhere else to go
When you're feeling low
Nowhere else to go
I know I broke your heart
