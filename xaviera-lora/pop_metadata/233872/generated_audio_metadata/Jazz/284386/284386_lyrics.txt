The way she moves, the way she grooves, everybody wants her
The way she slides, the way she glides, everybody wants her
Don't you look into her eyes
Don't you listen to her dirty lies
The way she walks, the way she talks
Everybody wants her
The way she sings, the way she swings
Everybody wants her
Don't you fly into her flame
Don't get caught up in her
Fool's game
The way she thrills, the way she kills
Everybody wants her now
She ain't got nothing to prove
She ain't got nothing to lose
Dirty lies, dirty lies, dirty lies, dirty lies
But don't you look into her eyes
Don't you listen to her dirty lies
The way she thrills, the way she kills
Everybody wants her now
She ain't got nothing to prove
She ain't got nothing to lose
The way she thrills, the way she kills
Everybody wants her now
Everybody wants her now
Everybody wants her now
Hey, you know, man, I got a name for chicks like that down south

Man, the guys at the bar are checking her out when she's walking by, look at that
They can't get enough of her
Man, everybody wants her, now she's looking at you now, hey
Hey, hey, we better get out of here man
Watch out
