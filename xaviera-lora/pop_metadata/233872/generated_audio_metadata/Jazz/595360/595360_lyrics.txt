The glass is half empty
But I don't feel sad
The glass is half empty
Middle ground ain't so bad
A full glass just might spill
And with my luck it probably will
Even a bottle gets lonely
I'll give it some company
I've got nothing better to do
I don't feel like crying
When there's no silver lining
It's okay by me
The glass is half empty
When you dream you're out of your head
And it's a nightmare you'll get instead
Even a tired old cliche still works for me anyway
I'll give the devil his due
Hope it's not too depressing
How I go on confessing
That it's just fine by me
The glass is half empty
The glass is half empty
