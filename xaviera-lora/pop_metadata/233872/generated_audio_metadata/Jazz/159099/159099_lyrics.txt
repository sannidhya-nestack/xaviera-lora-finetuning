To some I'm a sinner, to others a saint
The truth is I'm tarnished and in need of some paint
I'm part of your union but I'm tired of paying them dues
Doo doo doo
The world's a tuxedo and I'm just a pair of brown shoes
I smoke more than heavy, I drink to escape
At night when I'm sleeping, I dream I'm awake
I got no one to talk to, just them faces on the six o'clock news
Doo doo doo
The world's a tuxedo, I'm just a pair of brown shoes
Like to talk about your tendency to talk about me when I'm not around
You pound me in the ground
Now you're gonna feel so bad
I never really knew the love we had until I blew it, threw it away
I was a winner when I was a pup
I had some good habits but they all gave me up
I'll sell you my soul if you promise
You won't be refused
Doo doo doo
The world's a tuxedo
And I'm just a pair of brown shoes
Like to talk about the way we parted
Can't you see I'm broken hearted
And I want you back again
Our tempers took us for a ride
Too little love and too much pride
Made us blow it, throw it away
I'm not conditioned to living alone
I hear the doorbell, I pick up the phone
If one existed, I'd be listed in the losers who's
Who I do to
The world's a tuxedo
And I'm just a pair of brown shoes
The world's a tuxedo
And I'm just a pair of brown shoes
