Well, it's raining so hard
I can barely see across the yard
Yet the butterflies are gliding on the breeze
And the birds can still sing
Unencumbered by anything
Guess the world is fine up there in the trees
But in my heart there's rain
That gloomy everyday is Monday pain
And the weatherman inside
Says there's no sun in sight
And I miss you so bad
I've never ever known love like we had
And I know I never ever ever will again
We all suffer I know
But I never knew how deep this hole could go
And I'm falling, falling, falling in a space without end
I know tomorrow will come
And maybe with some time I'll just get none
I'll suffer
'Til then
I know
You're not coming back again
And I'm drowning in the rain
I'm drowning in the rain
I'm drowning in the rain
Drowning in the rain
