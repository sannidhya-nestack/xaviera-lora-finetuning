You feel it in your bones, sticks and stones
It moans like a sore tooth
A painful reminder to take off the blinders
Nothing hurts like the truth
You lie awake at night
Something's just not right
Fight or flight, you gotta choose
Eavesdrop the chatter
It's like falling from a ladder
Nothing hurts like the truth
Can't hide from your ghostly memories
Open up and let the prisoners free
Make it your number one priority
To ride the ship that's lost at sea
Don't sit around and cry
Don't contemplate why
You're high and dry and uncouth
Get up off your haunches
Free your subconscious
And just face the truth
Nothing hurts like the truth
I'm going to have to get out of here. I'm going to have to get out of here, I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going to have to get out of here and I'm going
Don't you sit around and cry
Don't contemplate why
You're high and dry and uncouth
Get up off your haunches
Free your subconscious
And just face the truth
Mmm nothing hurts like the truth
