He threw my love away
And now I'm broken in two
What can I do?
He played a wicked game
That left me empty inside
The tears that I've cried
Baby you have shamed me
You took my heart, betrayed me
This fever's burning so hot
Now I can't stop
Sitting under the bitter moon
He led me down a path
Was that just part of a plan
Of a cold hearted man
They say et the past
But I will spend every day
Making him pay
Baby you have shamed me
You took my heart and you played me
This fever's burning so hard
Now I can't stop
Sitting under the bitter moon
And one day you will see
No one makes a fool of me
And even though I try
All this anger I can't hide
The message I will send
Gonna get my sweet revenge
Soaking up the mood
Of the bitter moon
And I will come for you soon
It's gonna be soon
Baby, you have shamed me
You took my heart and you played me
This fever's burning so hot
Now I can't stop going under
Baby, you have shamed me
You took my heart and you played me
This fever's burning so hard
Now I can't stop sitting under the bitter moon
