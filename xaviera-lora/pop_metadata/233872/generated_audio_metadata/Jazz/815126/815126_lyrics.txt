Getting too close to you, I see now, you know I'm falling
Getting too close to heartbreak now, you know I'm reeling
Stand away from me my love
I can't take it anymore
Stand away from me my love
I can't burn anymore
And I can't walk away from you my love
Can't stop my rain
And I can't walk away from you my love
you're the sun though
You're shining bright
You're killing bright
You're shining bright
Stand away
Stand away
Stand away from me my love
I can't take it anymore
Stand away from me my love
I can't burn anymore
I can't walk away from you my love
Can't stop admiring
And I can't walk away from you my love
you're the sun though
You're shining bright
Killing bright
Shining bright
Stand away
Stand away
Stand away
Stand away
