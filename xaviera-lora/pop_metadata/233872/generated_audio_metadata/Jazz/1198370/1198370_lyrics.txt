What was the moment, the moment of truth
We felt it happen, I'm not sure we knew
Was it the first time I touched your face
Or our last embrace, I just kinda love ya
I just kinda love ya
I just kinda love ya
I just kinda love you
The moon is high, the tide is low
Someone's falling real slow
Why try to fight it? What's the use?
I can't find one excuse
I just kinda love ya
I just kinda love ya
I just kinda love ya
I just kinda love you
Let's skate away, you and I
On a frozen river of time
If it snows, we don't mind
Ain't life sublime?
I just kinda love you
I just kinda love you
I just kinda love you
I just kinda love you
I didn't mean to fall for you
Wasn't what I planned to do
Just kinda happened to my dismay
Ain't love strange that way?
Don't get me wrong I ain't complaining
It's just I'm counting the days remaining
Till I can see your smile again
Baby until then
I just kinda love you
I just kinda love ya
I just kinda love ya
I just kinda love you
I just kinda love you
