Life, life's full of surprises
I must have a lucky star above
At every turn good fortune arises
Like finding you and falling in love
Just when I think I know what's in store
I'm the master of my destiny
Life comes knockin' on my front door
With a special delivery
Yeah life, life's full of surprises
Like finding you and fallin' in love
Just when I have all my ducks in a row
I'm contented as I can be
Life drops gold at the end of my rainbow
It's serendipity, oh baby life
Life full of surprises
Oh, I must have a lucky star above
At every turn good fortune arises
Like finding you and falling in love
Like finding you and falling in love
And falling in love
And falling in love
And falling in love
