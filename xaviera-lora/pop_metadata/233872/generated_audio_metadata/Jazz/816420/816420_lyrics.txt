Oh, I shut back
Winter wonderland
Mountain peaks glistening in the snow
Wrath is sad
Frosted birds that fly over tops of alpines
(I don't know what I'm doing)
(I don't know what I'm doing)
Courchevel, winter's hidden jewel
Sparkling diamonds, palace view
Breath is sad
Frosted birds that fly over tops of alpines
