They tell that you are bold, that you don't feel the cold
And in the rainy season it don't pay to be old
Walking in the rain don't bring you down
If you're seeking love and you won't hear a sound
A sound, a sound, a sound, a sound
Take me to the rhythm of a conga beat
Something that you hear on every single street
They say if you seek love it can be found
Coming from the air and from the ground
A sound, a sound, a sound, a sound
When you're in Havana (Havana) or down in the Savannah (Savannah)
If you ain't with your mama (Mama)
Well, one good slap and you'll jump me back to the salsa, salsa
If you can hear a drum in the Calypso song
Bet your bottom dollar that it won't be wrong
If there is a feel it will appeal
And if you have the feel it's all around
A sound, a sound, a sound, a sound
When you're in Havana (Havana)
Or down in the Savannah (Havana)
If you ain't with your mama (Havana)
Yes, one good slap and you'll jump me back to the salsa, salsa
They tell if you are bold that you don't feel the cold
And in the rainy season it don't pay to be old
Walking in the rain don't bring you down
If you're seeking love then you won't hear a sound, a sound, a sound, a sound, sound
Oh, when you're in Havana (Havana)
Or down in the Savannah (Havana)
If you ain't with your mama (your mama)
Mmm, one bit's left and you jump deep back to the salsa, salsa
When you're in Havana (Havana)
Or down in the savannah (savannah)
If you ain't with your mama (mama)
Yes, one good slap and you'll jump me back to the salsa, salsa
Yeah, when you're in Havana (Havana)
Or down in the savannah (savannah
If you ain't with your mama (Havana)
When you're in Havana
