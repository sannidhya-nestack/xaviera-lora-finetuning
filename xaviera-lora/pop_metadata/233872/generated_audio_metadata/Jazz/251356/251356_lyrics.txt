Love to be strange, lovers would leave town or change
One thing certain always remains
You're the only true love
The only sure and real love
You're the only true love in my life
You've been here by my side
Through every turn of the tide
No pretending, nothing to hide
You're the only true love
The only sure and real love
You're the only true love in my life
We know when love is so easy to get hurt
We kept our promise, we made it work
You said when love was new, you would
Always be true
And I know I still love you
You're the only true love
The only sure and real love
You're the only true love in my life
In my life
In my life
Life
