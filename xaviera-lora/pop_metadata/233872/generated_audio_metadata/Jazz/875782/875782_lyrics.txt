Watch the sunset sky
All alone just you and I
Time it moves across our faces
Dangerous games we play
Silver bullets ricochet
Through the heart without the traces
As our passion grows
Deep desire that overflows
Burning up and takes you higher
One thousand three degrees
This fever's running ever free
Need a cure to give a love breeze
Watch the sunset sky all alone just you and I
Time it moves across our faces
Dangerous games we play silver bullets ricochet
Through the heart without the traces
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, with you, oh, oh, oh, oh, with you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause I'm with you,'cause I'm with you
