I'm singing in the rain
Just singing in the rain
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above
The sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, I have a smile on my face
I walk down the lane with a happy refrain
Just singing, singing in the rain
I'm singing in the rain, just singing in the rain
What a glorious feeling, I'm happy again
I'm laughing
In the clouds so dark up above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, I have a smile on my face
I walk down the lane with a happy refrain
Just singing, singing in the rain
