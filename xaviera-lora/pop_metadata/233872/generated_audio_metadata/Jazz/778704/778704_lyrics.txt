Some days just seem so lonely
Filled with the memories
Of a time I gave you
All that you meant to me
Found was the door to new love
If I had not lost the key
Wishing I had shown you
All that you meant to me
Do you know I love you?
Do you even care?
Was there a way could my words ever say
All that you meant to me
Do you know I love you
Do you even care
Was there a way could my words ever say
All that you meant to me
I can't think why all of the good things never last forever
For you and I was I so blind
We had everything
And so our days departed
For pastures of brighter green
And I'll always miss you
And all that you meant to me
All that you meant to me
All that you meant to me
