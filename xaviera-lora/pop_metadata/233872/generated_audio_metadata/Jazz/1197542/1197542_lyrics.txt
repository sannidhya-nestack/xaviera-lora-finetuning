I miss you
In a million little ways
So many things remind me everyday
So many things I want to say
I miss you
When the moon rises through the trees
When the stars begin shining through
I want to share them with you
Time stood still
For
So long
Then time flew by
And you
Were gone
I miss you
When the sky is blue
And there are flowers along the way
I remember the days
I miss you when the night is getting dark
And the candles have been lit
And the laughter starts
Time stood still
For so long
You touch my heart and now
You're gone
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
