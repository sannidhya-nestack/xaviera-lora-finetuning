So your baby and you ain't seeing eye to eye
Maybe he stayed out too late
Maybe she made you blue
Wait, don't argue, don't fight
Put your dancing shoes on tonight
While you both are dressing
Stop and count your blessings
One, two, three, four
Before you close that door
Shake hands and come out swinging
Head downtown for a little body banging
Left, right, left, up, dip, hip, flanging
Round and round'til that last call bell starts ringing and you shake
Hands and come out swinging
Blow some steam off on that old dance floor
Don't sit home and pout
Go on and knock yourselves out
Shake hands and come out swinging
One, two, three, four, before you close that door
Shake hands and come out swinging
Head downtown for a little body banging
Left, right, left, up, dip, hip, flinging
Round and round'til that nice tall bell starts ringing, ringing
Shake hands and come out swinging
Blow some steam off on that old dance floor
Don't sit home and pout
Go on and knock yourselves out
Shake hands and come out swinging
Shake hands and come out swinging
