Though the sky is blue, the moon is white
Harp how you ring, but all day hang, day and night
Jab su de chamak dahey, blue turns into gold
Ratmein sham de nikal dahey, white beauty untold
The sky ka rang, why is it blue?
Kyun ki hawa mein hai light ka diffraction is true
Moon kyun hai white, why not any other moon?
Kyun ki chand karona reflects the sun's light on you
Dhoop mein chandni mein
Iera mō kāke, nature ka magic, jēsē kōi ka mā
The sky is blue, the moon is white, is dunyā ke harapa, heaven can fly
Blue, blue, blue, my love is blue
White's no white, it's so blind
Blue, the sky is blue, the moon is white
Hard power, you're in, but all day and day and night
Japsu, the chamak, the hay, blue turns into gold
Ratmeen, shanda, nikal, dahe, white beauty
