Now and again I imagine your soft knock
Upon my door
Just like it was before you went your way
Now and again a sudden spring promise
Fills the air
Catching me unaware
But it won't stay
The sky wasn't the limit
My heart took quite a fall
One day every wild dream fit
Next day nothing at all
There was a time I would find myself glancing
Around each room
Thinking I might see you
But that was then
Still I can't help but look
Now and again
The sky wasn't the limit
My heart took quite a fall
One day every wild dream fit
Next day nothing at all
There was a time I would find myself glancing around each room
Thinking I might see you, but that wasn't true
Still I can't help but look now and again
