Cover one eyebrow with your heart then take me uptown
Duke the Valley and the captain spread some lube around
We're a classic black or grey suit never ever brown
Just do what Frank would do and I'm your gal
Treat a lady like a lady
Don't let my drink get warm
Be the last to fade each night and the first to greet the dawn
The chairman of the board gets to be the alpha male
Do what Frank would do and I'm your gal
Say what Frank would say
Play how Frank would play
Choose your poison, never cash in
Make your choice and show some passion
Hang around with the VIPs so they can think they're cool
Sing me love songs from your knees and I'll suit off my stool
Enunciate each consonant, articulate each vowel
Do what Frank would do and I'm your gal
Smile like Frankie smiles
Strive like Frankie styles
Make me laugh with all your joking
Take me back to your Hoboken
Keep that Rat Pack loyalty
Don't harmonize your view
Keep your taste impeccable, right down to your shoes
Have guys like Dee and then Sammy be your best pal
Do what Frank would do when down your gal
Do what Frank would do, guys
Bat those big ole blue eyes
Dooby dooby dooby that works without fail
Do what Frank would do when I'm your gal
