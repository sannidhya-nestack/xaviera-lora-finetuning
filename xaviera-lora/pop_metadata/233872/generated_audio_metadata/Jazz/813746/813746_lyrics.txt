I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go.
Things have really got to change from today
And I don't know how I got myself to this place
Oh, I want to see things the way they used to be
I'm gonna go back to the days and nights
Where everything was so easy
Things have gotta change from today
I got myself to this place
I wanna see things like they used to be
I wanna go back to the days and nights
Where everything was so easy
Never can tell what's on your mind
It's so crazy
Preoccupied with the time
So damn busy
What happened to you?
You used to be the life of the party
Now you're working for the dime
From nine'til five
And life just ain't so easy
Mm-hmm
