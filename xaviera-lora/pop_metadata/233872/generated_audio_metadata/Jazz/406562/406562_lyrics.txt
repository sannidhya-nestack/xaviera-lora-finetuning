Not for all the tea in China
Not for tickets to the game
Not for lotto winning numbers
Not for fortune and fame
Not for cold beers and the summer sun
Not for a sunset view
Not for the green grass on the other side
Priority review
I won't bother for you
You know my love is true
Maybe for world peace I'd consider it
Maybe for God and man
But not for all the tea in China
And they got a lot of tea in China
Not for Johnny Hartman's baritone
Not for Rhapsody in Blue
Not for one for my baby
Priority review
I won't barter for you
You know my love is true
Maybe for Christmas day for poor kids
Maybe to cure some bad disease
But not for all the tea in China
Not for all the tea in China
And they got a lot of tea in China
