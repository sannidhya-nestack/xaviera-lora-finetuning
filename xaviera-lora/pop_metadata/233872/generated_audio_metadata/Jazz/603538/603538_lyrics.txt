Been singing the blues
But I don't wanna sing them no more
But here come the blues
you haven't been knocking at my door
I'm blue everyday
And there's too many clouds in my sky
But they're here to stay
you're only a fading butterfly
Now I am being true
If you only knew
How I'm missing you
Now our love is through, what you gonna do?
Baby are you blue?
I gave you my heart and soul
And treated you just like a king
And you're gonna see
The other side isn't so green
So what do you say
Those pretty girls just ain't your style
Please baby come home
To the one who can always make you smile
Now I am being true
If you only knew
How I'm missing you
Now our love is through
What you gonna do
Baby are you blue
Now I am being true
If you only knew
How I'm missing you
Now our love is through
What you gonna do
Baby are you blue
Baby are you blue
Baby, are you blue?
