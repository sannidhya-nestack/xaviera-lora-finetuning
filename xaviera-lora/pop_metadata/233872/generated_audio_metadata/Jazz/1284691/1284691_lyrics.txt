Can my love for you be measured in a dandelion's flight?
And why do moonbeams insist upon the darkness of night?
And if the rings of love could be counted like the life of a tree
Would it make what you're feeling any sweeter for me?
And would we do it again if we knew where or when love would lead us?
But like a damned and iron's flight in the darkness of night
Love took command
Love held our hand
