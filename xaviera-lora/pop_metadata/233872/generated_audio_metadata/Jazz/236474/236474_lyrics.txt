When I think about you, I think I can live without you
And find someone who won't drive me insane
But when I get with you
I et I wanna quit you
And just end up loving you again
I try to walk on by you
But my heart won't deny you
And completely over rules my brain
My heart sometimes is strong
And though it may be wrong
I end up loving you again
Over and over I cross you off my list
But every time it's the same
When I lay my eyes upon you
I can't resist, oh, here I go again
So I guess that I'll put up with you
Since I never get enough of you
Besides, it don't do no good to complain
If you take it, I'll be giving
as long as I'm living
I'll end up loving you again
Over and over I try to break free
But just when I begin
I get this funny feeling all over me
It's you getting under my skin
So I guess that I'll put up with you
Since I never get enough of you
Besides I've gotten used to the pain
If you're taking I'll be giving
as long as I'm living
I'll end up loving you again
Until my dying day
Come what may
I'll end up loving you again
