Me, the minstrel, the teller of tales
Adrift, unanchored, a ship without sails
Till you, the artist with portraits of time
First found me
Unbound me and made your love mine
Together no madness our love cannot cure
Together, no sadness our love won't endure
Together, together, together with you
You, the sunrise, the fire in the sky
The warmth, the shelter, the one reason why
That me, the jester, the fool on the hill
First loved you, still love you, and forever will
Together, whatever our life has in store
Together, tomorrow and forevermore
Together, no madness our love cannot cure
Together, no sadness our love won't endure
Together, together, together with you
Me, the minstrel, the teller of tales
Adrift, unanchored, a ship without sails
you, the artist with portraits of time
First found me and bound me and made your love mine
Together, whatever our life has in store
Together, tomorrow and forevermore
Together, no madness our love cannot cure
Together, no sadness our love won't endure
Together, together, together with you
Together, together, together with you
