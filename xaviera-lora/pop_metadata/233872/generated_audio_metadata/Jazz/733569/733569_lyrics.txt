Poolside's the cool side, fools dive
The hippest day drive, noontime moonlight
Poolside is place to be
Kick back with a six pack, snack jack
Take a short nap, Trinidad to Hackensack
Poolside is place to be
Chase down the chase lounge
Next steps, turn on your headsets, slap on some oil, slip on your shades, you've got it made
One piece, two piece, long string, bikini briefs, sleazy, cheesy or discreet
Poolside is place to be
Chase down the chase lounge
Next step, turn on your headset
Slap on some oil, slip on your shades
You've got it made
Cherry Coke, root beer float
Banana boat, roll and get soaked
Heat stroke, no joke
Poolside is place to be
Noontime, moonlight, poolside is place to be
Sleazy, cheesy, or discreet, poolside is place to be
Turn a dead to hack inside, poolside is place to be
