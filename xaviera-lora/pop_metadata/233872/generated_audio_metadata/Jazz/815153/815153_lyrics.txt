I don't want a trip on an ocean ship
I just want you
No fine cigars
No fancy cars
I just want you
What good's a diamond ring?
It's just a thing to wear
Who needs designer shoes?
Well, I'd rather walk on air
No big nights, need the neon lights
I just want you
No headlines in the New York Times
I just want you
You're the only thing I need
To make my dreams come true
So I suggest et the rest
I just want you
What good's a diamond ring?
It's just a thing to wear
Who needs designer shoes?
Well, I'd rather walk on air
No big nights need the neon lights
I just want you
No headlines in the New York Times
I just want you
You're the only thing I need
To make my dreams come true
So I suggest et the rest
I just, I want you
I just, I want you
