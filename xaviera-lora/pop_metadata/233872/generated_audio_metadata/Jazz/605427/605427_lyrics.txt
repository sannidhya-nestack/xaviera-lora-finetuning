Well they turned off the neon at the corner bar
But I wasn't ready to climb in my car
So I ambled away across the street to the all night cafe
Looked at the menu a time or two
But all I could see were your sweet baby blues
I had to order the man said if I wanted to stay
So I'm drinking coffee between cigarettes
Shuffling some cards and hedging my bets
Wondering how far a man like me'd get
With someone like you
I'm drinking coffee between cigarettes
Replaying back all of my wasted regrets
I should go now but it's as good as it gets
Drinking coffee and trying to et
There's a blackjack
On the queen of hearts
Those twos and those threes
Are giving me starts
Each one it follows another
Ain't that always the way
But the radio's on
And the percolator's perking
The ceiling fans fanning
The aspirin ain't working
If I'm not too careful
You just might make my day
So I'm drinking coffee between cigarettes
Replaying back all of my wasted regrets
Maybe you'll come and sit when your working day sets
Drinkin' coffee
I'm drinkin' coffee between cigarettes
Still shufflin' cards, always hedgin' my bets
Guess I better go now,'cause it's as good as it gets
Drinking coffee and trying to et
