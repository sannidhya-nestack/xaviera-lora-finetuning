Lotus blossom, cradles baby in your petals, love eternal
Lotus blossom bathed in dew drops
Warm my dreams in golden sunlight
Shadows disappear, melted by a tear
Floating, gently floating
Lotus blossom, breezes sighing
Whispering secrets, mystifying
Lotus blossom, hear me singing
Rain is falling, ancient rhythm
Shadows in the mist, time does not exist
Floating, gently floating
Lotus blossom, cradles baby
In your petals love eternal
Lotus blossom bathed in dew drops
Warm my dreams in golden sunlight
Shadows disappear, melted by a tear
Floating, gently floating
Lotus blossom, breezes sighing
Whispering secrets mystifying
Lotus blossom, hear me singing
Rain is falling
Ancient rhythm shadows in the mist
Time does not exist
Floating, gently floating
Floating, we're just floating
We're just floating
