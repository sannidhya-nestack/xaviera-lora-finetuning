I left no fingerprints on the gun
The witness won't say a word
I tripped the fire alarm just for fun
I tell you nobody heard
Just be cool man and don't freak out
We had a plan and it was well thought out
And we got nothing
We got nothing to worry about
We ain't got nothing to worry about
We can beat the rap
I won't say nothing to rat us out
Don't fail the polygraph
Trench coat makes a quick disguise
If they catch you just act surprised
And we got nothing
We got nothing to worry about
We ain't got nothing to worry about
They wouldn't hear our plea
Now they've got us where we can't get out
They threw away the key
A jagged edge makes a perfect knife
When you're facing 99 to life
And we got nothing, we got nothing to worry about
We got nothing, we got nothing to worry about
