We're going to the Tiki Lounge
Gonna let our cares and worries drown
In a sea of frosty blender dreams
My Thai Singapore swing
You know sometimes I dream of you
In a little outrigger canoe
Paddling towards some exotic place
Those missionaries, ha, they try to race
That's just the way things are
Fake island in a cheesy bar
Cheesy bar
As we sway beneath the fake palm trees
Dog holes got nothing on me
We'll kiss beneath the lava lights
Let's do the Tiki Swing
All those tiny bubbles and Christmas lights
Make this a tacky paradise
The pattern on your shirt so loud
I can pick you out in any crowd
We're having imitation fun
As the ukulele strums (ukulele strums)
We're going to the Tiki Lounge
Gonna let our cares and worries drown
In a sea of frosty blender trees
Might I sing a parsley?
Let's go to Easter Island where the stone statues stare
At those graceful hula dancers and those grass skirts that they wear
Hey, Mr. Stone Statue, tell me, do you fear
Your reincarnation as a tacky souvenir?
We're calling to the tiki lounge
Gonna let our cares and worries drown
In a sea of frosty blended drinks
Might I sing a poor sleep
As we sway beneath the fake-balled trees
Done holes got nothing on me
We'll kiss beneath the lava light
Let's do the Tiki swing
Let's do the Tiki swing
Let's do the Tiki swing
Let's do
