Led me right in my dreams
Whatever still might be
Even though I know
Then we are done
There are such fairy tale chords I still hear
In the song that you're gone
No more, my heart's still unsure
Won't believe there's no song that you're gone
Something's there that listens
To whispers, to wishes
Softer than the song
The song that you're gone
There are such fairytale chords I still hear
In the song that you're born
No more, my heart's still unsure
Won't believe there's no song that you're gone
Once upon I loved you
I never thought of you
You the one I thought of as home
Once upon I knew you
I knew that I'd lose you
You the one who felt so alone
Soon that you're gone baby
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
There are such fairytale chords I still hear
In the song that you're gone
No more my heart's too unsure
Won't believe, babe
There's no song that you're gone
Too near this terrible fear
And I hear, babe
Such a song that you're gone
Stay here forever, my dear
Make believe
There's no song that you're gone
There's no song that you're gone
