Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Stormy waters
Love has gone astray
Washing away
Stormy waters
Such a lonely day, wash it away
On a bridge from afar
I watch the stormy waters push us further apart
I fear the hurt in me is here to stay
Until the stormy waters go away
Stormy waters over land and sea
Keep you from me
Cold cold water I want to find release
Please set me free
On a bridge from afar
I watch the stormy waters push us further apart
I fear the hurt in me is here to stay
Until the stormy waters go away
Go away, go away, go away
Sha-da-doo
On a bridge from afar
I watch the stormy waters push us further apart
I see the stormy waters on a bridge from afar
I watch the stormy waters push us further apart
I fear the hurt in me is here to stay
Until the stormy waters go away
I know this hurt in me is here to stay
Until the stormy waters go away
Until the stormy waters go away
