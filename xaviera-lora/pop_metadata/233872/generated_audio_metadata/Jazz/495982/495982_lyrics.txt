You gotta fall in love tonight
You gotta fall in love tonight
Your heart's gonna be taken
You'll have no defense
Your old ticker will be shaken
Shaken right out of sync
Hit by a pose
Blinded by the light
You're gonna fall in love tonight
Hit by a pulse, blinded by the light
You're gonna fall in love tonight
You're gonna know you've found a gem
One that sparkles, one that shines
You'll be looking at a diamond
One with a twinkle in her eyes
Hip-hop pose
Blinded by the light
You're gonna fall in love tonight
You're gonna fall in love tonight
You're gonna fall in love tonight
Your heart's gonna be shaking
You'll have no defense
Your heart will be shaking
Shake the night out of sync
Syncopation that is
Hit by a post
Lighted by the light
You're gonna fall in love tonight
You're gonna fall in love tonight
You're gonna fall
In love tonight
We're gonna fall in love tonight
