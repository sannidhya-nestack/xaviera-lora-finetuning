There's a party starting, better gather'round
When the band starts playing that magic sound
Your feet start shuffling when they hit the ground
It's a rag-hat boogie tonight
I came here looking for a quiet time
A little soft piano and a glass of wine
Then the band started playing and I tossed it down
I had to stand up and yell, "What's this thing going on?"
There's a madman
Blowing on the saxophone
The drums get pounding like there's no one home
The bass gonna take you where you don't belong
There's a rag hat boogie tonight
Keep on playin' that raghat boogie
Keep on playin' that raghat boogie
Keep on playin' that raghat boogie
Boy, until you die, whoo!
(French)
I was kicking back when I first arrived
Gonna spend a quiet moment with some friends of mine
But the band started playing and they tossed it down
I had to stand up and yell, "What's this thing going on?"
There's a mad man blowing on the saxophone
The drums kept pounding like there's no one home
The bass gonna take you where you don't belong
There's a rag hat boogie tonight
Keep on playing that rag hat boogie
Keep on playing that rag hat boogie
Keep on playing that rag hat boogie
Boy until you die
Keep on playing that rag hat boogie
Keep on playing that rag hat boogie
Keep on playing that rag hat boogie
Boy until you die
Sois fort, souffons, souffons, suffisant
Savons, souffons, souffons, c'est mon pays
Savons, souffons, souffons, c'sest mon pas, mon vrai papa
Batez-vous dans tout, batez-vous dans tout, batez-vous dans tout, tout va
