So baby are we done
You pick me up and show me to your door
Your clothes still on the floor
I'll go
Are you having fun
You bring me down you're playing with my heart
You've done it from the start
Baby, I'm not done
You play around and leave me in the night
Just tell me is that right, oh no
Baby, what went wrong
The sun comes up, I wake up and you're gone
You left me on my own, so
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
