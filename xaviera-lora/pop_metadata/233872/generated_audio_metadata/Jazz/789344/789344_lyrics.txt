Can you commit?
Can you promise to be honest?
Do you want us or do you not?
Can you commit?
Will you forsake all others and not be smothered?
Tell your mother this is it
Can you commit?
Put your arms in my fire and never tire
And keep me hot and keep it lit
Put your eggs in my carton never part and take my heart can you commit?
Now I submit we fit like an oven mitt
And from where I sit you're loving it
So quit teetering I don't need a ring
Just the truth can you commit?
Now I submit, we fit like an oven mitt
And from where I sit, you're loving it
So quit teetering, I don't need a ring
Just the truth, can you commit?
Just some proof, can you commit?
Oh, tell me the truth, can you commit?
