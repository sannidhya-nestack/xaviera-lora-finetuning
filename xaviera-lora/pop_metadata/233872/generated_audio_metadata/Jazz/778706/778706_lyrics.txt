Hey there goes your girl
You picked her from the sky
Great you're so in love
I'll just say goodbye
And I'll go to my room
Lock the door and sleep'til June
And I'll dream my days away
Wishing I were you
Hey, who's in that mirror?
I think I know that face
Someone I knew years ago
In a different place
Different time, different scene
But my eyes, they're still green
Can you tell me what I mean?
Wishing I were you
So where is my someone
My promise of a star
Everyone else seems to have one
So mine, it can't be far
I'll pick a four leaf clover
The luckiest of charms
Hoping that I'll find my baby
Sleeping in my arms
There goes my boy, swimming in the moon
Drowning every sunrise, April, May and June
But I know that you're there, it's enough to keep me here
Knowing it will all come true, wishing I were you
Wishing I were you
Wishing I were you
Wishing I were you
Wishing I love you
Ooh, wishing, wishing I
Oh, wishing I were you
Oh, wishing, wishing I were you
