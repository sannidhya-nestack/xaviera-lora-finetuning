Class act, that's what I wanna be
Class act, just like my mama taught me
Smilin' at the meet and greet
Helpin' little old ladies cross the street
It's a class act, tippin' the meter deep
Class act, everyone's smilin' at me
Like on the TV
That's what I want to be
I'll get you front row tickets to the show
I'll try to smile fast and anger slow
Sure I can give you a lift left or right
East or west rain or snow
Whoa, oh, class act
Grabbin' the bill to pay
Class act
Strollin' the Champs-Élysées
Oh, one of these days I'll be a class act all the way
I'll treat the guy on the corner like a king
I'll try to listen to everything
And when you're back in town I'll be the first one to give you a ring
Oh, let me sing it
Class act
Grabbin' the bill to pay
Class act
Strollin' the shops so easy
Oh, one of these days I'll be a
Class act all the way
A class act all the way
Class act all the way
Class act all the way
