Can my love for you
Be measured in a dandelion's flight
And why do moonbeams
Insist upon the darkness of night
And if the rings of love could be counted like the life of a tree
Would it make what you're feeling any sweeter for me
And would we do it again if we knew where or when love would lead us
But like a dandelion's flight in the darkness of night, love took a man
Love held our hand
So let's give love a chance and let's make romance
Because it would be tragic to lose this sweet magic that we know so well
So let's just close the door and make love like we made before
And like a dandelion's flight in the darkness of night, let's fly away
Let's fly away today
