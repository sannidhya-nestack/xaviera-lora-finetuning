Sleep my dear
And the world will slowly disappear
Sleep until the morning comes
Sleep my love
And you'll see everything from high above
Sleep and dream of days to come
I'll be your midnight sun
And don't you worry about anything
Don't be sorry, don't say a word
Just close your eyes and sleep
And the world will smile to you again
And I'll be waiting where the night ends
Sleep my heart
And the world will shine for everyone
Sleep and dream of life to come
I'll be your special one
Don't you worry about anything, oh no
Don't be sorry, don't say a word
Just close your eyes and sleep
Sleep my star
And your eyes will shine from afar
Dream of you and me as one
Until the morning comes
