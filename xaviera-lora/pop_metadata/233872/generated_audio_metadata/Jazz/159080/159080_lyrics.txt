It's me, just thought I'd give a ring
I just got in and wondered if you'd called
I know it's late, but I couldn't wait
I'm feeling wistful without you, hello
Are you still there, my sweet?
ive me, didn't know you were asleep
You didn't call at all after all
Oh, you've been too busy
Yes, I see
I'll say goodbye
I have to hurry now
Things are hunky-dory
Fine, I'll call you one of these days
Sure, and before ten
Yes, of course, I'm still a friend
Call me when you've a yen
Heard you're going
To Cape Cod, alright
I'll try to brace myself
You're leaving with your friend
Tomorrow night
You'll send a card
From dear old Cape Cod
Oh how nice, I'm glad I gave a ring
Goodbye, do have a pleasant trip
The colors in New England should be bright
Do send that card from dear old Cape Cod
Well goodbye, just thought I'd give a ring
He had a certain charm about him
But he never was a guy you would take seriously
