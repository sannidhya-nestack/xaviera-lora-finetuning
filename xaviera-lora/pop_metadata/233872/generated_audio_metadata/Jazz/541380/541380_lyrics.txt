Think I'm gonna go sail away
Forever and a day
Through the clouds and over the trees
Think I'm gonna go sail away
I'm gonna get me a big balloon
So I fly away to the moon
Through the stars on Mercury's tune
Gonna get me a big balloon
Breathe deep the golden air
Swirling through our minds
We'll find a solace there
An essence so sublime
Maybe we could fly away to Mars
The whole universe is ours
See the light wherever we are
Maybe we could fly away to Mars
Jupiter and Venus too
Is what I'm really gonna do
Saturn in its hazy dew
Jupiter and Venus too
Breathe deep the golden air
Swirling through our minds
We'll find a solace there
An essence so sublime
