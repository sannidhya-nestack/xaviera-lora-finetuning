Cruise control on easy street
Black numbers on the balance sheet
We're undefeated, we can't be beat
Like hot coffee with sugar and cream
You have to admit, we make a pretty good team
You have to admit, we make a pretty good team
It ain't always pretty, it ain't always fine
But you get yours baby, I'll get mine
You have to admit, we make a pretty good team
Apple pie a la mode
A pretty princess and her ugly toad
A pair of hands to carry the load
A pair of fans to battle upstream
You see what I mean
We make a pretty good team
Well you have to admit
We make a pretty good team
Sometimes we're skinny, sometimes we're thick
We'll build a castle, baby
Brick by brick, you'll have to admit
We make a pretty good team
Let's show some of that teamwork, boys
Spring flower day, the month of May
Sally Bowles needs a cabaret
My head might need a toupee someday
Wouldn't that be a scream?
You see what I mean
We make a pretty good team
Yeah, you have to admit
We make a pretty good team
Sometimes it's gravy, sometimes it's grease
We'll build a castle, baby, piece by piece
You have to admit, we make a pretty good team
We make a pretty good team
Hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, yeah
