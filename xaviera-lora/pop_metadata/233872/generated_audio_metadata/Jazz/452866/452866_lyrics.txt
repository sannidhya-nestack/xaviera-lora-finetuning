Give me a lion rug, give me some clothes
So I can scratch you out my life
Refute those shreds that eat you alive
Digest you, feel you inside
Feel you completely never do arise
No, I'm not gonna regurgitate or alleviate myself again, just know
You can't come back or tickle my throat with your delicious hair
I'm not gonna choke you over, over, over in my belly, mmm, in my tummy, yeah
Give me a lion growl
I said give me a lion growl
Eat you alive as you wake on down
Eat you alive as you tickle me now
I recluse to my lay, I have an eight
I'm meditating, boy, what you've done to me
I let it go and set me free
Mmm, when I sleep, I have an eight
Oh, and meditate, mm-hmm
In my lair, in my cave, in my lair
In my cave where it is nice and warm
I fur, lick my fur
I'm satisfied, this big head
She's so happy to be alive with dignity
She ain't no kitty
Give me a lion roar
I said give me a lion roar
Give me a lion roar
I said give me a lion roar
Go to my lane and have a mate
And light my fire and feel great
