She walks in beauty like the night
Of cloudless climbs and starry skies
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to crowded day denies
She walks in beauty
One shade the more, one ray the less
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven-terrace
Or softly lightens over her face
Where thoughts serenely sweet express
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place
She walks in beauty
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent
The smiles that win, the tints that glow
But tell of days in goodness spent
A mind at peace with all below
A heart whose love is innocent
She walks in beauty, she walks in beauty
She walks in beauty, she walks in beauty
Just watch her walk
She walks in beauty like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes
The smell of dew, that tender light
Which heaven to God it did inize
She walks in beauty, she walks in beauty
She walks in beauty
She walks in beauty
She walks in beauty
She walks in beauty
She walks in beauty
