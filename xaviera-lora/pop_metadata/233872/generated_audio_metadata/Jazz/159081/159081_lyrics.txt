Flying to Vegas in first class
Been upgraded from coach
I told the pilot he had class
And I liked his approach
Thank you but I don't like champagne
Or café Viennese
Sure they're very tasty, but I'd really rather have more peanuts please
No, no, no, you simply don't understand, am I speaking Chinese?
I'm not hungry, honest, and I don't want salmon or cheese, please
Lobster or pheasant under glass, they're for people with pedigrees
I don't think I care for demitasse, but I'd like more of these if you please
