Romance is a verm
Love's an action word
That catalytic erm
Makes a mint then stir
Practice every night
Till you get it right
It may start napping if you don't make it happen
No matter what you've heard, romance is a verb
Punctuate the heart with exclamation marks
Underline each part
That's a real good start
Serenade with song
Bouquets can't go wrong
Write Shakespeare quotes on post-it notes
Hang signs do not disturb
Romance is a verb
Wah wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah wah
You may say, "Hey, that's a noun"
Let me tell you what I've found
Giving's more fun than receiving
Every night is Christmas Eve when romance is a verb
Love's an action word, that catalytic erm
Mix'em in then stir
Romance is a verb
So get up off the curb
Find out where the magic lives
Use a couple adjectives
Like baby you're superb
Romance is a verb
Romance is a verb
Romance is a verb
