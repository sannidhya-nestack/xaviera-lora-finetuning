Slide down a moonbeam
Hang from a star
Try to et who you are
Try to remember the child you were then
And you might be again
The look that you gave me
I'd never seen
It came from a place I'd never been
Wish I could go
But where would it end? And could I get back again?
You took leave of your senses, you let them go
Chances are they will still be here when you get home
But if they are not here
I'll do what I can
Till they come back again
Till you come back again
There was a time when I was your friend
And if you want me to I'll be again
Take every moment you need to mend
Till you come back again
Till you come back
Again
