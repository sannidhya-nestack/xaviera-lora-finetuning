Everybody wants what they ain't got
Old wants young and young wants old
Cold wants hot and hot wants cold
Fat wants thin and thin wants fat
And here wants there and this wants that
Everybody wants what they ain't got
Looking in a bush kills the bird in hand
Man I swear ain't nothing over there still
Everybody wants what they ain't got
Everybody wants what they ain't got
The pitchers wanna hit, the hitters wanna pitch
Married once, single and single once, hitched
Curls once, straight and straight once, a wave
A bald once, hair and hair once, a shave
And everybody wants what they ain't got
Lookin' in a busk is a burning hand
Man, I swear ain't nothin' over there still
Everybody wants what they ain't got (ain't got)
Everybody wants what they ain't got
Come on Stephen!
You know rhyme wants rhythm and rhythm wants rhyme
Time wants money and money wants time
The singers wanna play, the players wanna sing
And everybody wants a little bada-boom, bada-bing, come on
And everybody wants what they ain't got
Lookin' in a buskills burnin' hand
Man, I swear ain't nothin' over there still
Everybody wants what they ain't got
Everybody wants what they ain't got
Everybody wants what they ain't got
Lookin' in the bus kills the bird in my hand
Man, I swear ain't nothin' over their skin
Everybody wants what they ain't got
Everybody wants what they ain't got
Everybody wants
What they ain't got
