We used to hold hands
And were happy to remain still
We used to look into the horizon
Twin gazes beyond the hair
We used to dream of each other
We knew the meaning of forever
We used to laugh with each other
At our being so clever
Love, just love
Hold us together
Gluing our hearts
Birds of a feather
Love, just love
Holds us together
Dreaming of us in the
Heart of the river
We used to play games of a kind
To test our love like it was puzzle time
We used to get gifts for each other
All through the months of the year
We used to look into our dreams every night
And hoped they matched each other
We used to sum up our little lives thinking
Time would stand away forever
Love, just love
Hold us together
Two in our hearts
Birds of a feather
Love, just love
Hold us together
Dreaming of us in the heart of forever
