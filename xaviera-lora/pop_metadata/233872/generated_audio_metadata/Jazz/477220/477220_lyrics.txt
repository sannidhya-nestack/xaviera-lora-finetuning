Standin' there, best beware
Got bad breath, got green hair
Lookin' gritty from the city
You got ears, they're real petty
Tattooed face, nose ring too
Stand my face, that's what he do
Clean my window, stop and grin
Hold out your hand like it ain't no sin
Get my money and walk away
Gotta take another route another day
Tattooed face, nose ring too
Stand my face, that's what I do, squeegee
You don't take my life, eat my kids
Clean out my pockets, smoke my lids
Steal my car, my wife too
Standing there, what's it gonna do?
Too much business, too much take
Check the kids if you forsake
Squeegee kids, squeegee kids, squeegee kids
Clean my windshield, steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
Mind my business, looking for a bar
Candy stayed on, quit wiping in my car
Squeegee kids, squeegee kids, squeegee kids, squeegee kids, squeegee kids
Blame your banker, blame your fed
They create those squeegee kids
Too much business, too much take
Check the kids that you forsake
Tattooed face, nose ring too
Same as me, the same as you
Squeegee kid
Whoa, squeegee kid
Too much business, too much take
Check the kids that you forsake
Blame the lobby, blame the feds
Blame your need, blame your greed
Tattooed face, nose ring too
Stand your face, that's what he do
Squeegee kid, squeegee kid
Squeegee kid, squeegee kid
