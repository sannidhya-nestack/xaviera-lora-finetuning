Is it love? Is it love? And does it really matter?
Is it true, really true? Or merely idle chatter?
Is it you, is it me, is it us, is it we, is it love?
Tell me why, please don't lie, will it fly, specify, is it love?
Are you mine, really mine, or someone else's baby?
Bottom line, are you mine?
No ifs or buts or maybe
Are you friend are you foe
Is it yes is it no
Is it love
Am I high am I low
Should I stay should I go
Is it love
Is it love, is it love
Or just a game we're playing
Is it true, really true
Do you mean what you're saying
Is it you, is it me
Is it us, is it we
Is it love
Tell me why, please don't lie
Will it fly, specify
Is it love
Are you mine, really mine
Or someone else's baby
Bottom line, are you mine
No ifs or buts or maybe
Should I go with the flow
Should I care, do I dare
Is it love
Is it phony or real
I don't know what's the deal
Is it love
Is it phony or real? I don't know, what's the deal? Is it love? Is it love?
