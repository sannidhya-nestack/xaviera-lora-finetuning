Patience is a virtue that I've never had
Just the thought of waiting nearly drives me mad
I like when things are simple, it's just my way
So could you make this easy and just go away?
I'm not into confrontations, I think fights are a drag
Now your favorite recreation is to nag, nag, nag
There's only one solution, nothing left to say
Please accept my invitation just to go away
I've given this a thought, I hope you're not too sore
It would make me very happy if you'd walk out the door
It's not that I don't like you'cause I think you're fine
But I don't see any future, lest we both go blind
You'll say that I'm a coward and I'm infantile
And you will not hear me argue'cause it's not my style
I'd like to be your hero but it just don't pay
So I'd gladly be your zero if you go away
Each night I lay awake in bed just counting sheep
But wondering if tonight's the night I'll finally sleep
I toss and turn and pace the floors'til break of day
Hoping that today's the day you'll go away
You see I have my conscience all misconstrued
So could you be an angel give me solitude
I'd be so very grateful just to hear you say
You've really finally had it and you're going away
