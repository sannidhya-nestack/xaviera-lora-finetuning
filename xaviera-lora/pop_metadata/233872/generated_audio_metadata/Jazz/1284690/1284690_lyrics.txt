Can my love for you be measured in a dandelion's flight?
And why do moonbeams insist upon the darkness of night?
And if the rings of love
Could be counted like the life of a tree
Would it make what you're feeling any sweeter for me
And would we do it again
If we knew where or when love
Would lead us
But like a dandelion's flight
And the darkness of night, love took command
Love held our hand
Can my love for you
Be measured in a dandelion's flight?
And why do moonbeams
Insist upon the darkness of night?
And if the rings of love could be counted like the life of a tree
Would it make what you're feeling any sweeter for me?
And would we do it again if we knew where or when love
Would lead us
But like a dandelion's flight
And the darkness of night
Love took command
Love held our hand
