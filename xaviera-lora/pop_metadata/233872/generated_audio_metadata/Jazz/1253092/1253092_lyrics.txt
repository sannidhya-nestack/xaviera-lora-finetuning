And I love the way you're always on my mind
And the love you're giving is so good she's all mine
Nothing in life is for certain
Since your love I'm no longer searching
My wounds have healed, no longer hurting
A new day's dawning, close the curtains
Forever unsteadied, no inertia
You are the one, the perfect version
Who's followed my heart and gave me purpose
Times when life was like a circus
Animal instinct kept me lurking
But deep inside you could see I was hurting
stress was an issue and my heart was nervous
But you found a way that gave me purpose
I found a woman
Who knows how to treat her man
Lord send me a woman, take me as I am
The way she looks tonight
I pray she's just mine
A million to one and she's finally mine
She speaks the truth, her words divine
Consciously she takes the time
To self express but holds the line
My better half you make me shine
Together we age like the finest wine
Our hearts are like the hands of time
Intricately intertwined
Lost her body but loves her mind
All eyes on me, her love is blind
So committed there's no denying
Depression and flame feels insane
The way she touches calls my name
No other love could ever compare
So let's keep holding through the years
I'm all in, let's take it there
And I love the way you're always on my mind
And the love you're giving is so good
She's all
I found a woman who knows how to treat her men
Lord send me a woman, take me as I am
The way she looks tonight
I pray she's all mine
