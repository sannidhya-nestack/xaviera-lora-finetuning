Look at me
I'm winning tonight
Look at you
You're looking out of sight
The boardwalk lights of Atlantic City
Don't sparkle quite like you do
You're so pretty
Look at me
I'm rolling the dice
My bets on you
I'm gonna let it ride
What are the odds?
Is your love a gamble?
All I know
If it's too hot to handle
Look at me
Look at me, I'm holding my queen
Darling you can be the ace up my sleeve
This joker's wild but your kisses will tame him
I can't lose thanks to you my world is changing
Look at me
I can't lose, lucky me
I got you, lucky me
