It's four in the morning and we've run out of beer
There's wine in the cooler but there ain't any here
So it's down to the corner
But what do you know, the beer starts to flow
I know that it's late but we want it fast after all
The band is playing
The saxophone's blowing a tune that I know
In steady four-foot time
Every week is so sweet, but it's him to the trip
That everybody knows of who's
We're too high to speak but we move our feet to the band
They call Blue Zeke, Blue Zeke, Blue Zeke
The music they played was unique, I tell ya it drove me crazy
Whoop-bop-shabop, shadooby-doo-wop
The band that really made people freak, Blue Zeke
(Music, music)
Daylight is coming and we got to get back
To the house where we live the other side of the track
My God is calling
Come home sleepy head
Your eyes are all red
But I'm not really tired
I'm really wired
Can't you hear
The music playing?
Just one more beer then I'm out of here
Into the morning light
I'd love to stay but I must get away
There's things I got to do tomorrow
But I just got to meet that crazy little creep
That's the band they call Blue Z
Bluesy, bluesy
The music they played was unique
I tell ya, it drove me crazy
Oop-bop, shabop, shidoo-be-doo-wop
The band that really made people freak
Bluesy
Lose it
