I've got a penny in my pocket, baby
Gonna save it for a rainy day
I've got a penny in my pocket, baby
Gonna save it for a rainy day
I hear a thunder rollin' babe
A storm is comin' right this way
A little pitty pattern ran down my face today
Wee little pitter patter babe
Raining down my face today
But I've got a penny in my pocket babe
And a whole lot of places to parade
Lord please help me
I've got so much to say
Lord please guide me
I need for my life to change
But I've got a penny in my pocket baby
And a whole lot of rain drops on my face
A little pitter-patter ran down my face today
A wee little pitter-patter, baby ain't got no place to stay
But I've got a penny in my pocket
And a whole lot of places to pray
Oh yeah
Lord please help me
I've got so much to say
Lord, please guide me, I need for my life to change
But I've got a penny in my pocket and a whole lot of places
A whole lot
A whole lotta places, a whole lotta places to pray
