Some day we'll dance awesome by New York
When the rain is gone
Some day we'll dance awesome by New York
To say love has come home
Someday we'll sing in somebody's New York
Say hello to the world
Someday we'll dance to the music of the sun
We will sing love in New York
I like in the springtime
To hear a lark in a tree
All it takes is a little sunshine
To feel happy
Carefree again
Some day we'll dance
All sun by in New York
All new life will begin
Some day we'll scent
Wild roses abroad
We will sing love
Welcome home
It's been a long and lonely winter
My heart feels sore, so empty and cold
Only the promise of summer
Will bring warmth and joy to my weary soul
Someday we'll dance a samba in New York
A new life will begin
Someday we'll sing while roses are broad
We will samba
In New York
Wishing for some peace in this world
No more hatred
Peace in this world
Peace
I wanna dance
A Samba in New Year
Sha la la la la
I wanna dance
A Samba in New Year
Wanna dance a Samba
I wanna dance
A Samba in New Year
Sha la la la la
I wanna dance
I wanna dance a samba in New York (I wanna dance a samba in New York)
I wanna dance a samba in New York
