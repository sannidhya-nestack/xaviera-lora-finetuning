You were once the best thing
I once thought this love would never quit
But nothing ever lasts, does it?
And I guess you gotta know
So starts the sorrow, yeah
It's time I better go
Baby, take a good look at me
I'm really done, baby, just done
Take one last look at me, can't you see?
I'm gone, baby, I'm gone
We really tried to be satisfied
Until we had nothing left to give
So if spring is renewal
Then fall is the loss, oh yeah
And that is the season of our love
Baby, take a good look at me, ooh
I'm really gone, baby, just done
Take one last look at me, can't you see I'm gone?
Baby, I'm gone, oh
There'll be love again for you and me
Springin' up like a summer flower
Maybe one day I'll be wiser
But today it's just sour, there's no sweet
Yeah, no sugar, just some sour defeat
Baby, take a good look at me
I'm really done, baby, just done
Take one, one last look at me
Can't you see I'm gone, baby, I'm gone
Baby, I'm gone
Baby, I'm -<|9.00|>
