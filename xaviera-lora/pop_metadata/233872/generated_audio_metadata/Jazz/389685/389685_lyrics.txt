For a while
I used to just believe what you say
Now I'm standing all alone in the rain
Like a foolish clown and you put me down
I waited again just for you
Now I'm sitting here with babies full of beer
What do I do
Maybe that's why
Maybe that's why
Maybe that's why
I'm still thinking of you
Cause every week it happens
I get the Friday night blues
In my dreams
You're holding me like you used to do
But I wake up all alone with my tears
I can tell myself you'll come back to me
But I know it'll never be true
Now I'm paralyzed by this loneliness
What do I do? I know that's why
I know that's why
I know that's why
I keep cryin' for you
every week it happens
Now, babe, watch out
I give the Friday night a boost
Working the week through
Wearing my disguise
Pretending that I'm over you
By Friday night the mask melts away
And all the torment comes through
I was once the man they all said could never lose
But I gave my heart and soul all to you
Now my hope is gone but I don't even care
I gave all I had just to you
I just can't escape all these memories
Yeah, what can I do?
Baby now that's why
I know that's why
I know that's why
I keep sending her booze
Yes
Cause every week it happens now baby look out
I give the Friday night a boost
Well now every week it happens now baby yes
I give the Friday night a boost
