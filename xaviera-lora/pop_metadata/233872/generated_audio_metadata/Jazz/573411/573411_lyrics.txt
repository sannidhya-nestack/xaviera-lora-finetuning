Remember being in love
Just like that couple right there
Look at them holding their hands
Making their plans for the life that they share
Remember what it was like
Just like riding a bike
Just like the moment you're told
When you've been mining for gold
You finally hit the big strike
Remember being in love
Just like those two right there
Look at her eyes as they close
As the hand that she knows
Gently strokes her hair
That was us, don't you know
About a lifetime ago
And it's no mystery you've grown apart from me
I guess we hit a plateau
But it isn't such a mountain to climb
We're there in the mirror of time
A crystal clear reflection of being in love
Remember being in love
Just like those two right there
Look at'em holding their hands
Making their plans for the life that they share
That was us don't you know
About a lifetime ago
And it's no mystery
You've grown apart from me
I guess we hit a plateau
But it isn't such a mountain to climb
We're there in the mirror of time
A crystal clear reflection of being in love
Remember being in love
