The stars are laughing, they're laughing at me
For dreaming too much
And thinking I could touch them
The stars are laughing
They're laughing at me
They're watching me cry
From their ivory tower sky
Hear them laughing
Where's all the sun?
He's supposed to be your friend
I can only promise you this
You won't get no sleep again
The stars are laughing
They're laughing at me
But not for long
It's almost dawn
The stars are fading
Fading out of sight
See you later on tonight
Can't you hear them?
Where's all the sun?
He's supposed to be your friend
I can only promise you this
You won't get no sleep again
The stars are laughing
They're laughing at me
But not for long
It's almost dawn
The stars are fading
Bye bye good night
See you later on tonight
The stars are laughing
The stars are laughing
