I lost my love
Down on that avenue
Stop lights blinking, it's such a shame
I lost my love
Down on that avenue
Street cars running just the same way
She keeps running
She'd beat the lights
I'm left watching her fade
Fade away tonight
Goodness gracious woman
You've got me sleeping without a dream
Guess I'll go home and you'll be with me
Tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been, tell me where you've been Tell me what's going on in your head Tell me what's going on in your head Tell me what's going on in your head Tell me what's
I'm not gonna let you go
I lost my love
Down on that avenue
Lights flashing, horns beeping, I'm getting mad
I lost my love
Down on that avenue
Why can't I realize love's a fact
Oh what can I do
Love's been kicking me around with a size 12 shoe
I'm left watching her fade, fade away tonight
Goodness gracious woman
You've got me sleeping without a dream
Guess I'll go home and be with me
Yes I'll go home and be with me
