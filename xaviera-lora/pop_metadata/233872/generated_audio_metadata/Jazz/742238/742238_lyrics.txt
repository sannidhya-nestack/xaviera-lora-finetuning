You hit with your mouth, you talk with your hands
Your lipstick's applied with crayola crayons
You said that you haven't, but you probably would
You said that you didn't, but hey, it's all good'cause I know you
When a warm wind starts to blow, all is iven
And when we love each other, all is iven
When the fat lady sings his song
Even if nobody sings along
All is iven
The tantrum you threw in the bar was nice
You picked up a shovel and you buried it twice
Blew out the candle and you cried in the dark
I threw you a line but it missed its mark, hey
When a sinner starts to pray, all is iven
And when we love each other, all is iven
When you're lonely and tired and cold
And you need my love to take hold
All is iven
You hit with your face, you talk with your feet
You threw down the gauntlet but I couldn't compete
You laid down the law, you broke the last straw
Sucker punched me, I never saw
Hey, when a sinner starts to pray
All is iven
And when we love each other all is iven
When you close your eyes at night
And all your dreams become vivid and white
All is iven
When the fat lady sings her song
Even if nobody sings along
All is iven
All is iven
All is iven
