I believe that you should never look back
The past won't change, what's done is done
Move on and live the moments
The race to win, we've yet to run
And I know one thing that hasn't changed
And that's the spark of passion
The touch reveals the bond that heals
And it's never out of fashion
Just one kiss
To get things started
Look what we've missed
Being broken hearted
Just one kiss
Let's stop pretending
And admit that our love is never ending
Let me show you girl what's waiting ahead
For only fools refuse to see
That fate decides our outcome
And fate tells me we're meant to be
So let's stop
Wasting precious time with some kind of regretting
So hold me tight and let's start tonight
By iving and etting
Just one kiss to get things started look what we missed
Being broken hearted
Just one kiss
Let's stop pretending
And admit that our love is never ending
Never ending
Oh, give me one more chance and I can surely change your mind
Oh, and when your lips meet mine I know just what you're gonna find
Just one kiss
To get things started, what we missed
Being broken hearted, and we'll both do
For one or two lucky breaks
Baby all it takes is just one kiss
Let's stop pretending
Our love is never ending
Oh, just one kiss
All you need is just one kiss
Get you in the mood
I'll be the enemy
Oh, just one kiss
