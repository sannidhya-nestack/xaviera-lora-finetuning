Are you stressed?
In a mess?
Not at all blessed
Not a high card left in your hand
Maybe time
To step back
From a long railroad track
See this ghost train of a journey for what it is
You try hard to sleep but there's 10 other things all fighting for your time
How can you relax at night when your mind goes into overdrive
And it's high high time you lift this train
And it's high high time you lift this train
Highly overrated, it's highly overrated, I was late
That's it really John
That's about it, really, John?
