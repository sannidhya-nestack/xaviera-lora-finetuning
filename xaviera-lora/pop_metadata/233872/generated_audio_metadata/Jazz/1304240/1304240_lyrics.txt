So nice to let it go
To let it flow away for now
So cool in every way
Each day I open
It's just a way of life, sitting on a bench
A way of life, learn a little French
Easy
Easy living now, my confidence is all I need
Let some power lead, the way to complete ease
So nice to be alive
To dance the chive once again
It feels that everything is so nice
My heart is dancing
For you to grab, embrace, take hold of
It's just a way of life
Sitting on a bench
A way of life
And everything makes sense
Easy does it, now my confidence is all I need
Let some power lead, the way to complete ease
So nice to have a friend
Someone to understand it all
I'm certain that it can be so cool
To be at peace, to be at ease, let's take it easy, easy, so nice
