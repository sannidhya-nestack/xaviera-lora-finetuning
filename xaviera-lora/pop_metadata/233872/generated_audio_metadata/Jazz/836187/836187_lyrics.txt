Mid-mid love mood swing
I'm deep blended mood swing
I'm elated between
How long rain to shine
Mid-mid love mood swing
Nobody loves me mood swing
Everybody wants me mood swing
Changing my mind
Maybe it's just a bad-ass day
Maybe you're nothing left to wear today
Baby, pay no mind to me
Man-to-man love, mood swing
Booth parties, now mood swing
How about a kiss, now mood swing
You better let me be
Feel just like Miss Piggy Bank'cause I'm so full of change
Swing my partner round and round and drive that guy insane
Mid-night love mood swing
Sinking in a cyber mood swing
Singing like a Robin mood swing
Mood swing, mood swing
Feel just like Miss Piggy Bank'cause I'm so full of change
Swing my partner round and round and drive that guy insane
Mad, mad love mood swing
I'm deflated mood swing
I'm elated between
How long rain it should
Mood swing, mood swing, mood swing
Mood swing, mood swing, mood swing
Mood swing, mood swing, mood swing
Mood swing, mood swing, mood swing
Mood swing, mood swing, mood swing
Mood swing, mood swing, mood swing
Mood swing, mood swing, mood swing
Mood swing, mood swing, mood swing
