Sitting at home about a quarter to eight
Two more hours'til we go on our date
I call you up on the telephone
I didn't wanna be alone
Couldn't wait, couldn't wait, couldn't wait to be with you
Couldn't wait, couldn't wait, couldn't wait to be with you
Couldn't wait to say the news
Couldn't wait to sing the blues
Said you'd like to go for a walk
Take a little stroll around the block
I didn't have to try to make you mine
Everything was going fine
I couldn't wait, couldn't wait, couldn't wait to be with you
Couldn't wait, couldn't wait, couldn't wait to be with you
Couldn't wait to tell you the news
Couldn't wait to sing the blues
Couldn't wait to be there
Couldn't not wait for us to share
Couldn't wait to laugh all night
Everything was going right
Couldn't wait to be there
Couldn't not wait for us to share
Couldn't wait to laugh all night
Couldn't wait to hold you tight
Couldn't wait, couldn't wait
Couldn't wait to be with you
Couldn't wait, couldn't wait
Couldn't wait to be with you
Couldn't wait to tie the noose
Couldn't wait to sing the blues
Couldn't wait, couldn't wait
Couldn't wait to be with you
Couldn't wait, couldn't wait
Couldn't wait to be with you
Couldn't wait to tie the noose
Couldn't wait to sing the blues
Couldn't wait, couldn't wait
Couldn't wait to be with you
Couldn't wait, couldn't wait
Couldn't wait to be with you
Couldn't wait to tell you the news
