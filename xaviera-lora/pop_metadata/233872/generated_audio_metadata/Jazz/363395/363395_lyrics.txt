Sunrise, morning time, the tide is coming in
Nothing's gonna hold me back now, I'm reaching for a dream
Gonna make it happen
Dreams can be real
Nothing's gonna hold me back now
To reach for what I feel
Been sliding away
Sliding away
I'm getting closer now
In the mirror
Working overtime
Yeah it's getting clearer, oh yeah
Oh baby it's getting so much clearer
It's been a later arrival
It's been a late arrival
Gonna make it happen
Dreams can be real
Nothing's gonna hold me back now
To reach for what I feel
Been sliding away
Sliding away
I'm getting closer now and nearer
Looking over time
It's getting clearer oh yeah
Ba da da ba ba
Ba ba da ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-day
It's been a late arrival
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ya, ba-da-ba-ba-ba-da
Do-da-da-da-da, do-da-da-da
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ya, ba-da-ba-ba-ba-da
