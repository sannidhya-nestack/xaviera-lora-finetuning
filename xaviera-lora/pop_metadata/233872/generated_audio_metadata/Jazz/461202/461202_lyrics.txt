This stone cold northern sky has got us dreaming
Of a sunny southern holiday
Down by the big muddy water
Where the days are hot and the nights are hotter
We can dance to a band that'll blow our blues away
So pack your red dress and your dancing shoes
We need some southern comfort for these northern blues
We're gonna dance until the sun comes up to Berber Street Band
We're going down down down to Dixieland
We'll follow that old Mississippi River
On our way to New Orleans
Then the very first thing we'll do is drink a hurricane for two
And get a belly full of that dirty rice and beans
So pack your red dress and your dancing shoes
We need some southern comfort for these northern blues
We're gonna dance until the sun comes up to a bourbon street band
We're going down, down, down to Dixieland
They can have Manhattan where the taxi cabs can flatten you
In no time flat
I'd rather party hardy at the Mardi Gras
As the P .O. say, "La zay la bata roulette"
So pack your red dress and your dancing shoes
We need some southern comfort for these northern blues
We're gonna dance until the sun comes up to a Bourbon Street band
We're going down, down, down to Dixieland
We're going down, down, down, down, down to Dixieland
