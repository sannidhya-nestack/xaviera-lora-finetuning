Woke up late, the clock's gone wild
Dreams still stuck, I'm a wandering child
Shoes untied, but the breeze feels right
The sun's my map, I'll chase the light
A day in the sun
A day in the sun
Let the worries go
Let's have some fun
Skipping stones where the river bends
Counting clouds like old time friends
Sunlight on the water as the day takes hold
The rising sun is getting hotter
The air is pure gold
No plans and no strings
Just the sky above
No rush, no need
Just a day to love
A day in the sun
A day in the sun
Let the worries go
Let's have some fun
The world can wait, let it spin its wheel
This heat's the only thing I wanna feel
Catch a laugh
Let it echo wide
The sun's my compass, the earth's my ride
A day in the sun
A day in the sun
Let your worries go
Let's have some fun
Golden rays dripping like wine
Bodies glowing, spirits entwined
Time dissolves in the heat of our skin
The days of Temple, let the worship begin
Velvet sky, intoxicate me
Every breath tastes like eternity
Lose yourself where the wild hearts run
Drown in the pleasure of a day in the sun
A day in the sun
A day in the sun
Baby, let your worries go
Let's have some sweet fun
