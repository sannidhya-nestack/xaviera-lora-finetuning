I can't resist this
Chance to make my great escape and run down the list
Of all the things that I could not afford to miss
I'm in a snowball of a world and I'm a fainted figurine
Spinning turning twisting so I break free
Shattered glass like scattered diamonds sparkling for me
All the lights and all the dizzy city streets
I'm in a great big world, I'm in a race to understand
Catch me if you can
I climb so high, till my fingers scrape the sky, no lie
If you don't believe me, try me, try me, try not to look down
We're halfway there
Hey, let's fight truth or dare
Don't be scared, just go, go, go for the action (ooh)
(ooh)
(ooh)
Go, go, go for the action
Go, go, go, go, drive me, drive me, come on, let it shine (I'm only a fool)
Speed behind my spear is crystal clear and finally I see
I can't stop because a thrill is what I need
I'm in a play, be the world, I'm in a race to understand
Catch me if you can
I climb so high, till my fingers scrape the sky, no lie
If you don't believe me, try me, try me, try not to look down
We're halfway there, hey let's face truth or dare
Don't be scared, just go, go, go for the action
Go, go, go for the action
Go, go, go, go, Johnny, Johnny, go for the action
I'd climb so high, ooh
Catch me if you can
I climb so high
Turn my fingers straight to sky
No lie
If you don't believe me
Try me, try me, try not to look down
We're halfway there
Hey, let's play truth or dare
Don't be scared
Just go, go, go for the action
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Go, go, go for the action
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Go, go, go, go, try me, try me, go for the action
