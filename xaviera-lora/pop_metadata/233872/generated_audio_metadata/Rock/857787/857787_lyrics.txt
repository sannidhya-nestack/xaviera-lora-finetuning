I don't want to walk away
et what I said yesterday
I really don't know why we fight like this, no
But I never want to let you go
And I've been stuck on this for days
Just to make it all okay
And I now see what love can do
It brought you to me and me to you
My skin lingers on you now
Don't wanna lose what I have found
I really wanna be the best part of you, woah
But don't ever let me see you go
And I've been stuck on this for days
Just to make it all okay
And I now see what love can do
It brought you to me and me to you
And I can't take this anymore
Please don't walk out my front door
This is exactly what I want right now
And I need you right next to me
Can't you see we're meant to be
I'll forever be stuck on this
Days go by and I see your face
Tomorrow seems so far away
And all I hear's a voice that's like
A siren in my head
I don't wanna walk away
et what I said yesterday
I really don't know why we fight like this, no
But don't ever let me see you go
And I've been stuck on this for days
Just to make it all okay
And I now see what love can do
And pray to me to meet to you
And I can't take this anymore
Please don't walk out my front door
This is exactly what I want right now
And I need you right next to me
Can't you see we're meant to be
I'll forever be stuck on this
And I've been stuck on this for days
Can't you see we're meant to be
Just to make it all okay
Can't you see we're meant to be
And I now see what love can do
I need you right next to me
It brought you to me and me to you
And I've been stuck on this for days (I've been stuck on this for days)
And I've been stuck on this for days (And I've been stuck on this for days)
