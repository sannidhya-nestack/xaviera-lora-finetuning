Fear as darkness now descends
Upon this frozen land
I write to who once was my love
You have never left my heart
And fear
Is building up inside
As I travel towards the light
I wish that we could meet again
Just to make amends
I have never seen this place before
I have never felt this pain before
And the day that saw you leaving
At the coldest night I've known
Why can't we always be the ones we were?
Why can't we always be the ones we were
Hear me, I speak to you my love
My body's been made to rest
And love, from where I am I try
To reach your broken heart
They say that when you die there's love
Such thing as life and love
I am here and waiting for your soul to reunite with mine
I have seen this place before
And I might leave here just once more
And the day I saw you leaving
Was the longest I have known
Why can't we always be the ones we were?
Why can't we always be the ones we were?
I feel it's almost over
I must let go to discover
Will there be light for all eternity?
