I know you cried when I was cold inside
About me losing you
And it's so long ago, well how would you know
That love could grow so cold
We tried to go back to the summertime (can't go back)
But winter had set in (can't go back)
There was no going back to the way we were
Baby, that was the end
The softness in the shadows
And the warmth in the home
Baby, they're all gone
We try to go back to the summertime
But when I had said it, you know that
There's no going back to the way we were
Baby, you know that was the end
We try to go back to the summertime (and go back)
That winter and set in (and go back)
Listen now, there's no going back to the way we were
One more chapter
In our lives
One more chapter
