So lately, I've been finding it strange
Always thought it was a phase
You know what, I don't mind
We don't see eye to eye
You are far from sunny days
All but lost in separate lanes
I'll just turn this all around
You're the one that's bringing me down
you got to, got to, got to
See you late, you're moving around
I'll just get out of the way
Stop weaving in and out
We know this road goes round and round
You know what, I don't mind
I don't need to wait for you this time
You are far from sunny days
All but lost in separate lanes
I'll just turn this all around
You're the one that's bringing me down
you got to, got to, got to
See you late, you're moving around
I'll just get out of the way
You're the one that's bringing me down
you got to, got to, got to
See you late, you're moving around
I'll just get out of the way
Get out of the way
Get out of the way
Get out of the way
Get out of the way
You're the one that's bringing me down
you got to, got to, got to
Stay here, you're late, you're moving around
I'll just get out of the way
You're the one that's bringing me down
you got to, got to, got to
Stay here, you're late, you're moving around
I'll just get out of the way
Whoa, get out of the way
Whoa, out of the way
Oh whoa, oh whoa
Get out of the way
