And did you ever have a wish for a girl who could inspire?
A ten thousand year itch of hella hot desire?
Well let me introduce you please to a girl who fits the bill
I think she took the little red pill
She's a sight to see, Ms. Margie is my worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She struts in her high-heeled shoes, life's gotten better, she got everything to lose
Fashion's so funny, I have to get an airplane, see at what cost
Mom's a pretty penny, come and get some, would you like a little treat?
Turning heads everywhere, trust me, there are very, very many
She's a little more than filthy, rich boys, tough bitch, welcome to the sweetness
Oh miss mommy
You're one sexy sweet honey
Was it a thing that you adore miss money?
Now you got a little would you like a little more miss money?
Sweet little honey I can see that you are vexed
Take a minute check your mobile tell me if you got my text
Flexible finesse and I can see that you've been messing with some things I think you think that you've never seen before
She's got a wallet but it's quite the little fatty
Generous, she is very, very, very catty
Buying up her love is something that she can't ever seem to get enough of
Of a swipe of a card, a light to play the part
Crashing it very hard in the market for her heart
Oh, miss money, you're a fantasy, I think about you every day
I wonder if you'll ever be
A significant other person to a person in your life
Maybe you're a girlfriend, maybe you're a wine
Miss money, oh, she's no dummy
Buy slow, but it's never ever show me
We can still go up green in her life
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
She's got a stockpile of sweet admirers
They're all just the assets that are fueling her desires
She trades her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment, not selling just to park it
Her laughter rings like a cash register chime
But love's a currency she can't seem to mine
Up on Provo you'll have hearts on what a portfolio
But the dividends and love she'll never really know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Miss Money, oh, oh, she's no dummy
Eyes locked but it's never ever chummy
Waiting for no upgrade in her life
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
A market of romance she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a defreeze
But oh how she'll spend to seize
She's a penny pincher with a golden touch
But the cost of love, it seems too much
Miss money, oh the irony's not lost
Can't budget for love, it's an endless cost
Now she's bankrupt in the market of hearts
A fiscal failure tore her heart apart
But oh miss money
You're still a sight in the cold hard cash of the night
Miss money, oh she's no dummy
Eyes locked but it's never ever shown you a face
With a love cream in her eyes
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
So kiss her miss money, but better love her full
May your ass feel liquid
This money, oh she's no dummy
Eyes locked but it's never ever shown you
With this blue love creed in her eye
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
So here's to this money
A bell on the pole may your ass text me quickly
