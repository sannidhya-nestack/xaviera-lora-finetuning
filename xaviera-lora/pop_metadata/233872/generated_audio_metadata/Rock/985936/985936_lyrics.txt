See it walk away
See it going down
There has to be a way
The scent is burning all around
There's nothing more to say
When words are falling to the ground
You ask for out of way
You ask for my direction
When the feeling comes you feel it go
Can you ask you
When you find yourself you'll find another life before
Can you see it come now you see it go
Can you feel it it's okay
It's alright to say
What is in your mind
The silence is the way
Of turning lights around again
See it run away
See it going underground
Time and time again
A leaf of wind as I surround
Now you see it come, now you see it go, right past you
Did you find yourself left you walking out the door?
When you see it come, when you see it go, so he said so it's okay
When the feeling comes, you feel it go
Can you ask you
When you find yourself, you'll find another life before
Can you see it come, now you see it go
Can you feel it, it's okay
