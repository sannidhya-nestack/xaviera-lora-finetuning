Sometimes I'm cold
But I'm not feeling lower
Sometimes I get cold
But I'm not feeling super
Sometimes it's cold
When you are not here
And if I count
Man you'll never be here forever
Sometimes I'm cold
But I'm not feeling lower
Sometimes I get cold
But I'm not feeling superb
Sometimes it's cold
When you are not here
And if I count
Man you'll never be here forever
Sometimes I'm cold, but I'm not feeling lower
Sometimes I get cold, but I'm feeling super
Sometimes it's cold when you are not here
And if I come, may you never be here forever
Sometimes I'm cold, but I'm not feeling lower
Sometimes I get cold, but I'm feeling super
Sometimes it's cold when you are not here
And if I count, may you never be here forever
Sometimes I'm cold, but I'm not feeling lower
Sometimes I get cold, but I'm not feeling super hot
Sometimes it's cold when you are not here
And if I count
Man you'll never be here forever
Sometimes I'm cold
But I'm not feeling lower
Sometimes I get cold
But I'm not feeling super
Sometimes it's cold
When you are not here
And if I count
Man you'll never be here forever
Sometimes I'm cold, but I'm not feeling lower
Sometimes I get cold, but I'm feeling super
Sometimes it's cold, when you are not here
And if I come, may you never be here forever
Sometimes I'm cold, but I'm not feeling lower
Sometimes I get cold, but I'm feeling super
Sometimes it's cold when you are not here, yeah
And if I come, may you never be here forever
