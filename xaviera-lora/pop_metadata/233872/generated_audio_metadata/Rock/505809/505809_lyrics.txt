The day begins again
Repeat from start to end
It's all the same confusion
Complicated, thick and thin
We've hit land so let's just start over
Bring this ship to a boarding grow older
Still we try, and we hold our breath till we make some sense of this
You and I, should we go our separate ways
Over it, over it, been so long I can't recall it
Over it, over you and I
It's complicated, lost for words
It's broken from the inside out
Curse at the sky constellation
You know you're right make them listen
Over it, over it
Been so long, I can't recall it
Over it, seems so far away
Over it, over it
Been so long, I can't recall it
Over it, over you and I
You're not a wish
Hanging on a wish
Wishing you would smile
Captivated
Pull me under
Hanging on a wish
Wishing you would smile
Captivated
Pull me underground
In this honest work we do
It's honestly open
Still we try and we hold our breath
Till we make some sense of this
You and I should we go our separate ways
Over it, over it
Been so long I can't recall it
Over it, seems so far away
Over it, over it
Been so long I can't recall it
Over it, over you and I
You and I
You and I
You and I
Ooh, you and I
Ooh, you and I
You are the one thing I want in my world
You are the one thing I want in my world
You are the one thing I want in my world
You are the one thing I want in my world
You are the one thing I want
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
One in a million, one in a million, oh
One in a million, one in a million, one in a million, oh
One in a million, one in a million, one in a million, one in a million
Why do I think you want to knock all this? (x2)
