Walking through the fields of gold
Hand in hand a story told
In the quiet of the dawn
Find the strength to carry on
Every turn step or take
Building dreams that never break
Guide us through the path we choose
With love we never lose
Bound by love it's been so true
In the things we say and do
In the moments that we fight
Love is always on our mind
Standing tall through thick and thin
With your heart I always win
In the shadows, in the light
We find hope to make things right
Every turn, step we take
Building dreams that never break
Guides us through the paths we choose
With the love we never lose
Found by love it's still so true
In the things we say and do
In the moments that we fight
Love is always on our mind
Standing tall through thick and thin
With your heart I always win
In the shadows, in the light
We find hope to make things right
Through the highs and through the lows
In your arms my heart knows
Every day and every night
We will always find a light
Hand in hand we walk the line
With your love I know I'm fine
In the silence of our space
We find peace in each embrace
Bound by love and stay so true
In the things we say and do
In the moments that we fight
Love is always on our mind
As the world around us spins
In your love my heart begins
Bound by love we carry on
Through the dusk into the dawn
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
