Got my time to be free
And a pocket full of dreams
Here I am standing on my own
I'm just one of a kind
A stranger kind of mind
You'd better not put my back against the wall
Whoa, I feel the wheels are turning
Whoa, in the heat of the night
Oh, now my heart is burning
I feel comes the time to hear just my voice and take my life
From the hills to the west, no time to take a rest
As long as I can see the morning light
I walked straight to the fire
Way down to the wire
Leaving this old troubled world behind
I feel the wheels are turning
In the heat of the night
I feel my heart is burning
It comes the time to live my life
I was born to run
Time is coming on strong
But I was born to run
And I don't care if I fall
I was born to run
I'll try to hold back my way
I've got my song and it's all I can take
I was born to run
I will go along the road
In every corner of the world
Looking for the joy and the pain of a man
I'll leave all my memories
In a pocket full of dreams
Here I am
I was born to run
And I've just had my song
But I was born to run
But I don't care if I fall,'cause I was born to run
Like a sheep against the tide, I keep on running on
With a good Lord by my side, oh yeah
I was born to run (born to run)
I was born to run
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Water run
