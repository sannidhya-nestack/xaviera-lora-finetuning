Hope is gone, I fall to my knees and pray
A wave of darkness is over me
Your frame shattered like the sands of time
An open canvas is tossed aside
Grab the storm covers you now
But the worst pain was natural
now I'm lost
Lost and all alone
No more can I walk along your side
But your steerage, dear, on my own
A constant reminder of the pain and agony
The blood courses through my veins
But my heart don't really beat
Granite stone covers you now
But the worst pain was natural
now I'm lost
Lost and all alone
You're all I need
You got no air for your life, all you got was an empty burning hell
I said truth and justice, but it don't exist, need a hero there
I said an holy crowd couldn't find no peace against my life I've ruled
Let's fuck the least, he'll walk alive, no longer party jail
Took from your innocence and simple life the pain was so profound
Confused how the person that I grew to love escaped in the ground
Wonder what you'd look like but I can't go back in time you changed that day
Used to think I owned this to the sun but now I can't seem to find a way
