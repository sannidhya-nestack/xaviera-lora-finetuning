She always speaks her mind and always knows the truth
She doesn't care that her approach is so uncool
She always seems to know which way the world will spin
And she's so confident that she will always win
And she can read my mind and loves to play her games
She doesn't seem to care to remember your name
She moves so free and clear just like an acrobat
She doesn't give a damn where you think her mind is at
She takes it slowly but suddenly she's fast
By the time your mind's made up
She's left you in the past
And she can do things that you would never dream of
All the while you hope to God that this ain't love
And you can try your best to make her your wife
She'll leave you wondering the rest of your life
You'll never see her cry or hear her laugh too loud
She's always in command, alone or in a crowd
She'll catch you watching her and with a little smile
She'll pick your heart right up and she'll throw it a mile
And she can move mountains but she rarely has the need
She can stand right up upon her own two feet
