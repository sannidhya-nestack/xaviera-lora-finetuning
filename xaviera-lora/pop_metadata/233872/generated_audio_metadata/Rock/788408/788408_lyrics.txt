They say yesterday's an evicted tenant
Today's a gift we call the present
And I'm already against the next war
Yeah I'm with tomorrow, God and on the ground floor
Don't let'em fool you, it's money they're for
And I'm already
Against the next war
Tell the politicians and the media boys
We're tired of being told who to vote for
The game's been played and we all know the score
And I'm already against the next war
Pissed on earth now they've all got a reason why we should fight
They call it treason if we don't see their light
I'm already
Against the next war
I'm already
Against the next war
Tell the politicians and the media boards
Which I'd have been told who to vote for
The game's been played and we all know the score
And I'm already against the next war
For what it's worth now if just the old generals do the next dance
You can be sure they'll give peace a chance
I'm already against the next war
They'll jump out the foxhole, slam the jeep door
Drive it like they stole it with the pedal to the floor, I'm all ready
Against the next war
Tell the politicians and the media boards
We're tired of being told who to vote for
The game's been played and we all know the score
And I'm already against the next war
Like I said before if you're embarrassed go ahead and blush
Start now avoid the Christmas rush I'm already
Against the next war
I'm already against next war (I'm already against next war)
Bombs away (I'm already against next war)
Bombs away (I'm already against next war, I'm already)
Bombs away (I'm already against next war I'm already)
Yeah, I guess I'll bounce away
Against the next war
