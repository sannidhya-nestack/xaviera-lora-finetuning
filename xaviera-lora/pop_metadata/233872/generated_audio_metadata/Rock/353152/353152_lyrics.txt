Moon is light in the clouds
Sun is dark on the moon
Winter lends its willingness
Synthetic trees are all in bloom
Sunlight lays on your lace
Wind is cool on my face
And as much as I live
I will remember this place
You're wet, wet like a river rat
Chill right down the bow
Your hunger spins like a tiger
I hear your hunger moan
Life is like a steeple chase
You scream and panic in their tapes
If you're a king, show some grace
Try to remember this place
You're wet, wet like a river rat
Chilled right down to the bone
You're holding your strings like a tiger
I hear your hunger moan
Baby, give it all you got
Get ready, get hot
You gotta give it all you got
Give it all you got
Get ready, get hot
You gotta give it all you got
Water clear as the sky
No wind as good as the high
In as much as we live
I shall remember this place
Sunlight lays on your face
The wind is full on my face
Moon is light in the clouds
I will remember your face
You're wet, wet like a river rat
Chilled right down to the bone
Your hunger, smooth like a tiger
I hear you're on the move
Baby, give it all you got
Get ready, get hot
You gotta give it all you got
Give it all you got, get ready, get hot, you gotta give it all you got
Give it all you got, I'm ready, I'm hot, you gotta give it all you got
