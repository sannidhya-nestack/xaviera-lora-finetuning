Stand up
All alone I ride my road
Still I don't know for how long
Making all the same mistakes I should have known
Moving on from town to town
Seems like I'm fooling around
Holding on a dream that's outward to be found
Days are burning, wheels are turning
To a hypothetical direction
I've been waiting, wise and steady
But still I'm here on the run
So just stand up, follow your heart
Live it up, it's the only way to be free
Stand up for what you believe
And never slow down, never give up
Do all you can from now until eternity
Stand up for what you believe
Like the day that I was born
Seems I got nowhere to run
In my mind I'm sure of what I'm looking for
So don't look back, don't waste your time
I know you long to get by
you ain't gonna stop'til you get it right
Days are turning, winds are turning
We just keep on looking for some action
I've been waiting, wise and steady
Still might be on the wrong, baby
So just stand up, open your heart
Live it up, it's the only way to be free
Stand up for what you believe
And never slow down straight from your heart
Do all you can from now until eternity
Stand up for what you believe
For what you believe
I've been holding on too long
To leave another day
And try to keep the faith
Now I wanna go through the red light
I can run and run and
I won't let the sun go down, no
Days are burning, wheels are turning
We just keep on looking for some action
I've been waiting, why isn't steady?
Still I've been on the run
So just stand up, follow your heart
Living it up is the only way to be free
Stand up for what you believe
And never slow down, never give up
Do what you can, from now until eternity
Stand up for what you believe
There's nothing in back
Foolish and a bad
Stand up for what you believe
But what you believe (just give your way)
Ooh, stand up (stand up, baby)
Ooh, stand up for what you believe
But what you believe
Ooh, stand up
Ooh, stand up for what you believe
Stand up for what you believe
Stand up for what you believe
