What's wrong now sweet baby
Where are you going alone
Please don't you cry like you're crazy
Every time it's the same song
You wanna die, it felt faint
You're making my brain go insane
Now come back here
So listen well all that I say
I'd never give up to myself
of your full obsession
So if you don't like all that
I don't give a damn, crazy woman now tell me
Tell me, yeah
Tell me baby what you don't understand
Maybe you just need another man
Tell me baby what you wanna do
This isn't what I am but I'm not so fool
I walk all day in a warehouse
And when I come back home
I got a world that you can't take away
Man of a beer and a rock'n' roll
You don't like my friends
You are jealous of a band
You just wanna make love
But you will miss me when I'm gone
And now tell me
Crazy woman, tell me, yeah
Tell me baby what you don't understand
Maybe you're just living of a man
Tell me, tell me
Tell me baby what you wanna do
that's what I am
But I'm not so fool, crazy woman
Tell me baby what you don't understand
Maybe you just need another man
Tell me, tell me
Tell me baby what you wanna do
that's what I am
But I'm not so fool
Ooh, tell me, crazy woman, tell me
Crazy woman, tell me, crazy woman, yeah
Tell me, crazy woman, tell me
Crazy woman, tell me, crazy woman, yeah
Tell me, tell me, tell me
