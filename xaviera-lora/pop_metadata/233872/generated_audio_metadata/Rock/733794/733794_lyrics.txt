You thought that things would never change
Like a childhood memory you know it all too well
Watching a clock that never ends
Even after you've found me
Pray with your own hands
Pray with your own hands
Pray
This crowd is all that you can be
This world is all that you can see
This road is the only path you'll lead
You're all corpse
Is the only thing you'll leave
Empty coffee cups in your hands
It wasn't the air that choked you
It was the thought that got stuck
In the back room of heaven
Through someone else's hands
Your thoughts are all over the floor
But you still don't understand
You got to learn
To pick yourself up with your heart
With your own hands, wave
With your own hands, wave
With your own hands, personality
Way down here down
You know it all too well
You know it all too well
All too well
You don't know how I feel
