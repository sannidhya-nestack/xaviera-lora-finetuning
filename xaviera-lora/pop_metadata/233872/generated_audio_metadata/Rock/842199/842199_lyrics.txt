On your knees, say your prayer, live this life if you dare
On your knees, say your prayer, live this life
If you dare, hear it now
So the story goes
Feel you in my blood
Feel you in my bones
Tragedy so soft and sweet
That's a taste runnin' in the street
On your knees
Say your prayer, live this life
If you dare, on your knees
Say your prayer, lift this light
If you dare, here we come
Here we go, one more time
Here we go, one more time
Here we go, one more time
Here we go
One more time, look to the sky and see what is there
Tangled fingers and violet hair
Daisy chain stud and fingernails
Music comes out from behind its veil
Prickle deep, let the sinness in
Dance on your grave, always spin and spin
Come on now, there's no need to fake it
The time is here now, please don't you waste it
On your knees
Say your prayer
Live this life
If you dare, on your knees
Say your prayer, live this life
If you dare, here we go
One more time, here we go
Here we go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, one more time
Here we go, oh, oh, oh, one more time
Here we go, go, go, go, one more time
