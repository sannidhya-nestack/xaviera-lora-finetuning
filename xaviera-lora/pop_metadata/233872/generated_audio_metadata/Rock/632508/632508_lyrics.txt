You think I'm cold as ice
But I can be real nice
I'm just not the kind of guy
You show I care
Can't you see that I
I didn't mean to make you cry
You think I'm a wolf but I'm just a teddy bear
So try to understand
I'm just a man
And I want you
And I need your loving every day
And even though
I won't let my feelings show
I love you more than you'll ever know
Just more, so much more
Than you'll ever know
It's deep inside my heart
But I won't let it show
But if you're really sure it's the love you're looking for
I got more than you'll ever know
So try to understand that I'm just the man that I want you
And I need your loving everyday
Oh, and even though I won't let my feelings show
I love you more than you'll ever know
Well there's more, so much more
Than you'll ever know
It's deep inside my heart
But I won't let it show
But if you're really sure
It's the love you're looking for
I got more than you'll ever know
Oh yeah
I got more than you'll ever know
Baby, I got more
So much more than you'll ever know
