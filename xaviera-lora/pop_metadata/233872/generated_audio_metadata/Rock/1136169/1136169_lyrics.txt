Lay down this guilt I let consume me
Closer to rapture's liberty
Before the light fades I implore my fears
Because I can't prevent myself
Devoid of reason my tribulations
I refuse to be
I disintegrate
I release you now
I emancipate
Disremembered faith is all I have
So apart from what I used to dream (and so on)
I'll see through the promises
The secrets live
I refuse to be
I disintegrate (I give in)
I release you now
I emancipate
The edge of the world collides
With conviction I remain
Watch as the world
Collide
Clear and conscious form
Hollow souls
Let rapture take control
I refuse to be
I disintegrate
I give in
I release you now
I emancipate
I give in
