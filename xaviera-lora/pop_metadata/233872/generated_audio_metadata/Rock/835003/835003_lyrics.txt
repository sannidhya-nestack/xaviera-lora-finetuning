Ooh, what have you done?
You've made a fool of everyone
The earth, it still revolves around the sun
But nothing ever changes
Now how many times must you fool me twice
Before I've realized that I'm wrong
Lay it out on paper it all seems nice
But we're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I can see it in your face
Still we reopen our case
Thinking there must be evidence
We missed along the way
But nothing ever changes
So how many times must you fool me twice
Before I realize that I'm wrong
Then we spend our time just being nice
But it's gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
And time keeps running away
Yes time keeps on running away
We run in the same circles, you and I
And you can say we never tried
But we've been around this from all sides
But nothing ever changes
No nothing ever changes
So how many times must you fool me twice
Before I realize we're wrong
Laying out on paper it all seems nice
But we're gone gone gone
Oh how many times must you fool me twice
Before I realize we're wrong
Lay it out on paper, it all seems nice
But we're gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone
Gone, gone
Gone, gone
