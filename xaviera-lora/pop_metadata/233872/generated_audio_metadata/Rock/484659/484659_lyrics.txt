Something happens when you call my name
It stirs up something that I can't explain
Pouring down like a driving rain on my secret love
I could swim inside those pretty eyes
Even if they only tell me lies
I lie awake staring through the night
For my secret love, secret love
Secret love, know that I exist
Just to taste your tender lips
I'd walk away but I can't resist my
Secret love, secret love
The moon looks down on a summer night
Cast its shadows in the evening light
I'm looking for you in each passer-by
My secret love
I could find your smile in every face
Wishing we were in another place
Where I could slip into your tender grace
My secret love, secret love
Secret love, are you miles away?
Are you something I'm imagining?
Are you more than just a mystery, my secret love
Secret love
La-loo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
La-loo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
My eyes open to the winter chill
Snow falling on my windowsill
Far away from where the time stood still
With my secret love (secret love)
Secret love, know that I exist
Just to taste your tender lips
I'd walk away but I can't resist
My secret love
Secret love, I know you can't be here
But if you were, you'd know I'd hold you dear
While I'm singing softly in your ear
My secret love
My secret love
Secret love
And I lose
La-loo, la-loo, la-loo, la-loo
Secret
Secret love
