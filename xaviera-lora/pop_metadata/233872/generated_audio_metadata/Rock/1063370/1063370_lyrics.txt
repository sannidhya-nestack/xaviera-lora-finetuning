In a state of confusion
Tell myself I'm breaking through
Just a man with a vision
Just one simple truth
Caught in a wave of emotion
I know there must be something more
And like a man on a mission
I've got nothing to lose
I've gotta move
I've got something to prove
That I'm gonna go
Go the distance my way
Yeah, I'm gonna go
And go the distance my way
And when no one would listen
I'd tell my friends I'd make it through
Not a courageous conviction
Just a simple truth
Now through all the commotion
There's gotta be an open door
And with blinded ambition
I'm gonna push right through
I gotta move
I've got something to prove
That I'm gonna go
Gonna distance my way
Yeah I'm gonna go
Gonna distance my way
I wanna live it up and live the dream
I won't give it up now I'm running free
So I'm living it in my dreams
And I'll feel it all over again
Gotta move
Gotta move
I've gotta move
I've gotta move
I've gotta move
Got something to prove
I've got something to prove
I've got something to prove
That I'm gonna go
Go the distance my way
Yeah I'm gonna go
Go the distance my way
I'm gonna go
I'm gonna go
Yeah I'm gonna go
Go the distance my way, I'm gonna go
Go, go
