The thrill, the hunt, the highs, the lows
Here comes the crash and so it goes
All the while you blame yourself
A fix that starts beneath your skin
The rolling dice
You slip it in as if you had no other choice
The game, the hype, the girls, the fame
Wanting to have it has become a habit
Wanting to take control what control's taking me
So this will be the last dinner in diamond earrings
I had to have it now I can't have it
Wanting to have it has become a habit
Wanting to take control what control's taking me
This will be the last dinner in diamond earrings
I had to have it, now I can have you
A fix that starts beneath your skin, the rolling dice
You slip it in as if you had no other choice
The game, the hype, the girls, the fame
Wanting to have it has become a habit
Wanting to take control but control has taken me
So this will be the last dinner and diamond earrings
I had to have it now I can't have you
Wanting to have it has become a habit
Wanting to take control, but control has taken me
So this will be the last dinner in diamond earrings
I had to have it, now I can't have you
You ask, I do
You give, I take
You love, I fake
These things do not apply when I get this high
Don't know how the ending goes, as long as the embers glow
There's still time, light this flame, burn it bright, land this flight
I need to curse a lot, it gives me control where I know it's lost
Back home, where it corrodes, such a tragedy
That no one knows what it's like to lose a family
That's alive but a special kind of dead to me
While I'm getting cosigned by proven contenders
Losing all the pretenders, trying to keep my mind alive
Eating bones if I had to work a nine to five
Sorry mom, sorry dad, if you care, I'm doing fine
Loving life, free of guilt, loving you
Sorry that I had to do all the things I wanted to
Sorry that I had to do all the things I needed to
Wanting to have it has become a habit
Wanting to take control but control has taken me
So this will be the last dinner in diamond earrings
I had to have it now I can't have you
Wanting to have it has become a habit
Wanting to take control but control has taken me
In diamond earrings
I had to have it
Now I can't have you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
