I try to believe that it will never end
The childhood dreams are coming true again
I'm not so sure what kind of friend I've been
Maybe one more chance here to begin again
Ooh, it could be timing
Ooh, but I'll keep finding if my road leads back to you
But one more step and maybe I'll come undone
I don't know if a change is ever gonna come
iveness feels the same no matter where it's from
So I'll keep trying to be the one
Ooh, it could be timing
Ooh, but I keep finding my road leads back to you
Tell myself don't ever wonder how
You just hang on to everything that's now in
It's now in my hands
Ooh, it could be timing (It could be timing, yeah)
Ooh, but I keep finding (I keep knowing) my world leads back to you
Ooh, it could be timing (could be timing)
Ooh, but I keep finding (I keep finding) my road, it's back to you
