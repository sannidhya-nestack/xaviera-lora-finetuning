I would wait forever
If it takes that long
You couldn't give me a time frame
That I wouldn't
Wait for
I just want you in
My life
Somehow
And I did not know
All of this
Until now
I don't need things
No expenses, no
When I'm with you
That's enough
I would wait until the end of time
And wait on the longest line
Went to the highest heights just to see the sight of you
And baby I'd give you anything
If I thought that it would bring
Even the teeny-tiniest little cute smile you do
Your kisses smell like fresh vanilla
And let me tell ya, it was just a pick
To think that all my life I've loved chocolate
And now I'd switch it in one sec
I hope that tomorrow brings us more love and happiness
Right now our lives are crazy
But I think we're passing all the tests
I don't need things, no expenses, oh
When I'm with you, that's enough
I would wait until the end of time
And wait on the longest line
But to the highest heights just to see the sight of you
And baby I'd give you anything
If I thought that it would bring
Even the teeny-tiniest little cute smile you do
I would wait until the end of time
And wait on the longest line
Go to the highest heights just to see the sight of you
And baby I'd give you anything
If I thought that it would break
Even the teeny-tiny little cute smile you do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
