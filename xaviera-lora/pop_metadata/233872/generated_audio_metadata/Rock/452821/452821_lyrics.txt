Photocopier, Monitor, Visible, Named, Page, Riveting, Pigeonhole, Pigeonhouse or Aboutler, Cellidels, Guts, Bells, Cellins, Cybein
Thought I'd try it out, the big time paperwork
The sort you read about, full time office clerk
I got my foot in the door and said
Give me more than anyone else has ever got
Before long under the spell, crawled into my cell
They treated me well, but it didn't hurt
all those places I've signed are bits of my mind
On every file, on every shelf
Hardcore clerical now, it's killing me
Can't stop thinking about
Refilling the photocopy, I'm so much happier now
My monitor's clear and visible
In my job I meet loads of interesting people's names
On a page it's riveting
Don't go doing your own thing
When you can home in on a pigeonhole
Where you are king
Dreamed of flying away, destroyed every day
My paperweight tray can kill the pain
Give me plenty to do, outside sky is blue
I can't see the view, I can't complain
Hardcore clerical now it's filling my mind with nothing at all worth leaving behind me
When I am gone who'll be number one at filling in forms to cover me
(Crying)
Wheels won't stop, so feel that clock ticking through your blood
Got a house to anise if I'm no cost
Can I please not have the weekend off to be lost and terrified
Time for spiraling down, left free of control
No rushing around, no letters to fold
Life letting me drown, got nothing to hold
