Automatic, it's an automatic thing
Automatic
Yeah, I'm the kinda girl who gets carried away
My typical obsessions don't last more than a day
Was out with old ones and in with the new
But I knew it would be different when I laid my eyes on you
It's nothing I can't help
It's nothing I can't fight
You're flipping a switch
And now this condition's got me up all night
I'm an automatic-ronic
It's an automatic thing
I've got automatic butterflies
On automatic wings
It's an automatic love song
I'll perpetually sing
I'm an automatic-ronic
It's an automatic thing
Bang, bang, bang, bang, automatically
I taught myself to be the one who calls the shots
Something about you makes me everything I'm not
My body's gone robotic since my human heart, your soul
Incurable, untreatable, it's out of my control
It's not that I can't help
It's not that I want to
You're short of the circuit
Make it a certain I won't get over you
I'm an automatic-ronic
It's an automatic thing
I've got automatic butterflies
On automatic wings
It's an automatic love song
I'll perpetually sing
I'm an automatic-ronic
It's an automatic thing
Automatic
I'm an automatic, automatically in love
If that's not what you feel please be kind
I'd stop if I could'cause I should and I would
But you're the automatic fantasy in my mind
I'm an automatic-ronic, it's an automatic thing
I've got automatic butterflies on automatic wings
It's an automatic love song I'll perpetually sing
I'm an automatic-ronic, it's an automatic thing
I'm an automatic-ronic, it's an automatic thing
I've got automatic -<|25.32|>
It's an automatic love song, I will let you while you sing
I'm an automatic, it's an automatic thing
