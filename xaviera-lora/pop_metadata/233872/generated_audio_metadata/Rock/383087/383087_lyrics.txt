I can feel the ice crackin' beneath my feet
With the cold out truth a-rippin' I'm all with each and every beat
And the sun refused to shine
Like a child who's left behind
And if I said to you tomorrow
Hey would you give it all away
For peace of mind and resurrection?
And by the end of the day
I could feel it
I could feel the ice cracking beneath my feet
With the cold of truth a-rippin' on my heart with each and every beat
And every sun refused to shine
Like a child that's left behind
I can hear the thunder
And I can see the lightning
But I still can't feel the rain
And if I give you one more reason
Hey, could you try to understand?
all around I couldn't believe in
And I thought I was your man
At least you told, at least you told heaven hand
I could feel the ice cracking beneath my feet
With the cold of truth a-rippin' on my heart with each and every beat
And the sun refused to shine like a child that's left behind
I can hear the thunder and I can see the lightning
But still can't feel the rain
I can't feel the pain
It gets you feel, it gets you feeling in the night
I can feel the ice cracking beneath my feet
With the cold of truth a ripping I'm all with each and every beat
Let the sun refuse to shine like a child that's left behind
I can hear the thunder
Night can see the lightning (see the lightning)
But still can't feel the rain
And the sun refused to shine
Like a child who's left behind
I can hear the thunder
And I can see the lightning
But still can't feel the rain
I can hear the thunder
And I can see the lightning
But still can't feel the rain
No, I still can't feel the rain
Said, I still can't feel the rain
No, I still can't feel the pain
