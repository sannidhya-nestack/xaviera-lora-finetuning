Come so easily
Rushing straight to my brain
Flow so effortlessly
I wish life was the same
What's the point of this
I won't remember in the morning
As I look into the sun
My eyes are burning
So I look to the moon
Where my heart is yearning
So hard to stay on the ground
While the earth is turning
Some then delivered to your front door
No one could ask for anything more
So we decided to live this way
A feeling, a rhythm
Can carry us away
Come so easily
Rushing straight to my brain
Flow so effortlessly
And I wish life was the same
What's the point of this?
I won't remember in the morning
As I look into the sun
My eyes are burning
So I look to the moon
But my heart is yearning
So hard to stay on the ground
While the earth is draining
Some of them delivered
Into your front door
No one could ask for
Anything more
So we decided
To live this way
You're feeling the rhythm
And carry us away
I come so easily
Rushing straight to my brain
Flow so effortlessly
I wish life was the same
I wish life was the same
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
