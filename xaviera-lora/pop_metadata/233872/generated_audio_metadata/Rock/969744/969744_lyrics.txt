It's coming out tonight
All the lies and secrecy
And you say the end is coming soon
And if I say I'll promise you
I'll promise only lies
And if it's what I mean to you
You'll know the reason why
A change has clearly taken place
Feel like going to the roof
I've made up my mind
This is my goodbye
Lead this revolution, draw the lines and play the game
Now find your peace or end it all
You said the memories are all we really need
Join the left for a hard way
Enjoy your last reprieve
A change has clearly taken place
Feel like going to the roof
'Cause I've made up my heart, mind
This is my goodbye
A change has clearly taken place, feel like going to the roof
I've made up my mind, this is my goodbye
A change has clearly taken place, feel like going to the roof
'Cause I've made up my mind
This is my goodbye
