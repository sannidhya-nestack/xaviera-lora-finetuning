Granite castle on a cliff
Silence reigns in towers
Here the silent shadows live
Growing purple flowers
Granite castle by the sea
Lightning stabs the ocean
Here a fair maiden lives
Showing few emotions
Bring the storms to ruthless seas
Bring me owls and ravens
Rule with me those waves beneath
Under Nordic heavens
Bring the fires on this world
Lightning strikes the castle
Echoes shake the rock below
Clouds are flying faster
She commands her lifeless ghosts
Here she reigns in towers
And one thing she likes the most
Beds of purple flowers
Dressed in purple she will walk
Down the endless hallways
Ocean slams the lifeless rock
Ruthless now and always
Bring the storms to ruthless seas
Bring me owls and ravens
Rule with me those waves beneath
Under Nordic heavens
Bring the fires on this world
Lightning strikes the castle
Echoes shake the rock below
Clouds are flying faster
Granite castle on a cliff
She will sing in towers
Songs of joy for waves beneath
Songs for purple flowers
Bring the storms to ruthless seas
Bring me owls and ravens
Rule with me those waves beneath
Under nordic heavens
Bring the fires on this world
Lightning strikes the castle
Echoes shake the rock below
Clouds are flying faster
(Oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
