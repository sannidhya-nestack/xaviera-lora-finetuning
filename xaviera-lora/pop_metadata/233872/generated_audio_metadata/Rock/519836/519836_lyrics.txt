What do you see out on the other side
Your road is clear but is your vision wide
You're tossing you turn you're searching everywhere
How can I make you see there's no reason to be on the other side
Heal this heart of mine
Could it change your mind
Free the feelings I can't breathe in
Heal this heart of mine
Where you belong, you just don't know you're safe
You wanna run, but what if you go astray
Would you turn around, or would you call triple A
Bring the map and the route, take the bend in the road and come straight to me
If you just hear this heart of mine (Could it change your mind)
Could it change your mind (Hear this heart of mine)
Free the feelings I can't breathe in
Hear this heart of mine
How can I make you see
There's no reason to be on the other side
Hear this heart of mine
Could it change your mind
Free the feelings I can't breathe
Then hear this heart of mine
Could you hear this heart of mine?
Could it change your mind?
I can't breathe and hear this heart of mine
Won't you hear this heart of mine
Hear this heart of mine
Could it change your mind? (Won't you hear this heart of mine?)
Free the feelings I can't breathe in
