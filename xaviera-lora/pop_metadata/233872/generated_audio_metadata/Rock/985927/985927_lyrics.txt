We're going home with a master plan
We're going home with a head in the sand
When we're, we're growing old
We grow old and the time goes slow
We don't know how to face the cold
When we're, we're going home
With all the time I wanna be
Sometimes I just wanna feel
All alone lost by myself
And now I feel the same
We go on with the mass supply
We go on with the head in the sound
When we're
When we tag along inside this Ferris wheel going round
This is how I feel when I hit the ground
When we're
When we do the same
With all the time I wanna be
Making plans like it's 73
All alone lost by myself
Do you still feel the same
We go on with the best we can
We all live on the second hand and win
It's all the same deep down inside it's all the same
Till we hit the ground and make a change to win
We're going home with all the time I wanna be
Making plans like it's 73
All alone lost by myself
And now I feel the same
