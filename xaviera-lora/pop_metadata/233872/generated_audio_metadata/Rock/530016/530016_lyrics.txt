I was in the darkest part of the desert night just before the dawn when the spirits wandered
And a deep, foreboding darkness smothered out the starlights in the sky
It crept down from the desert hills and spread out on the plains with space beyond it
Where it wrapped its cold embrace around the lives of those who chose its place to die
In the distance something howled in a low and mournful sound
On the window voice was whispering cleanse this hollow ground
And mothers grabbed their babies and held them to their breast
As a thunder cracked a flash split through the night
It's the uninvited guest
This land for it takes a weak and weary
But the balance of survival can be shaped by other means
And there are those who come to feed on, carry in and hide behind the blackness of the night
Too many go to wait or claim their rights in this foreign place where they are watched by eyes unseen
And they over-tact the delicate structure that preserves this way of life that they write
In the distance something howled in a low and mournful sound
On the window boys was whispering cleanse this hollow ground
And mothers grabbed their babies and held them to their breast
As a thunder cracked a flash split through the night
It's the uninvited guest
The desert is a place of light from death
That it gives no quarter or favor even in the face of sin
And those that seek to change it for their own purposes
End up no worse or better than those who lived by its laws
In the scorching daylight everything seeks its own cover
Until the shadows come and spread the darkness once again
And then the nocturnal ones move
Warily in search of prey
But a deathly fear of what their search may cost
And in the distance something howled
In a low and mournful sound
On the wind a voice was whispering
Cleanse this hollow ground
And mothers grabbed their babies
And held them to their breast
As a thunder cracked a flash went through the night
It's the uninvited guest
It's the uninvited guest
