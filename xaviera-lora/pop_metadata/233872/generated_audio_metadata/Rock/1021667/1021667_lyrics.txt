In the stormy world of April's deepest thoughts
Sadness was desire
In the somber realm of jaded late night talks
Regret was a spark for a fire
I was there
In the solemn land of April's cautious trust
Anger was despair
And in the tender space of gently moving dusk
Every thought was shared
I was there
I was there, her pain was mine
And struggled with the thought of how to be
I was there all the time
Trying to bring her thinking back to me
I was there
In the troubled home of April's worried mind
Silence was concern
On the many nights when we were intertwined
Every touch was spurned
And many things were learned
I was there
I was there, her pain was mine
Searching her every thought so patiently
I was there all the time
Trying to bring her thinking back to me
And hoping that she knows that she is free
I was there
I was there
