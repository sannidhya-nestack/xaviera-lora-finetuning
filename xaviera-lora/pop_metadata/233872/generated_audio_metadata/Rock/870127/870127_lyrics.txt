You've got ebony eyes that tantalize and tease
You're the devil and you'll bring me to my knees, uh-huh
You're such a flirt
I know I should run'cause there's danger in your kiss
The way you love me's too good to miss
Make love to me baby
Sweet love to me baby
Make love to me baby
Rock me all night long
You're a real heavy hitter and you fill me with desire
The way you love me sets my soul on fire
You're such a flirt
I know I should run'cause the danger in your kiss
The way you love me is too good to miss
Make love to me baby
Sweet love to me baby
Make love to me baby
Rock me all night long
I gotta watch my step and keep an eye on my heart
you're the kind of woman who could tear it apart
I know what's wrong'cause there's danger in your kiss
The way you love me's too good to miss
Make love to me baby
Sweet love to me baby
Make love to me baby and rock me all night long
I gotta watch my step and keep an eye on my heart
you're the kind of woman who could tear it apart
I know I should run'cause there's danger in your kiss
The way you love me's too good to miss
Make love to me baby
Sweet love to me baby
Make love to me baby
Rock me all night long
You've got ebony eyes that tantalize and tease
You're the devil and you'll bring me to my knees, uh-huh
You're such a flirt
I know I should run'cause there's danger in your kiss
The way you love me's too good to miss
Make love to me baby
Sweet love to me baby
Make love to me baby
Rock me all night long
Make love to me baby
Rock me all night long
Hey yeah
