Here we are, a party in Seoul
Down by the lake and down by the shore
Time to go swimming, now swing off that rope
Here we go, here we go
Up and down, around those coves
In and out, just so you know
Give me your hand and we can go
Here we go, here we go
Life is everything we got
So live it up, you only get one shot
One shot, it's all for the money
One shot, it's you and me honey
We got everything we need, just you and me
One shot, take it or leave it
One shot, keep on believing
We got everything we need, just you and me
Here we are, a partying soul
Out of the water, up on the shore
Time to go party,'cause everyone knows
Here we go, here we go
We're all by the campfire now
Smoking them s'mores and eating them all
Grab your guitar and I'll sing along
Showing a song, a sound that I love
Life is everything we got
So live it up
You only get one shot
One shot, it's all for the money
One shot, it's you and me honey
We got everything we need, just you and me
One shot, take it or leave it
One shot, keep on believin'
We got everything we need, just you and me
One shot, it's all for the money
One shot, it's you and me honey
We got everything we need, just you and me
One shot, take it or leave it
One shot, keep on believing
We got everything we need, just you and me
