When the lights go down in your world
And when the night won't disappear
With no end in sight
And you're standing right here
Alone in your fear
Taking you down the road to nowhere
I know that your heart is broken
So many words are left unspoken
What you gonna do now change your life
Yeah what you gonna do now change your life
Yeah what you gonna do
Yeah, what you gonna do not to survive
Hear the sound upon your window
The rain is falling down
And you've been hunting high and low
So turn and look around
And take some time and find your light there
And come without fear
And let the past just disappear
Now you're here
And your heart can be unbroken
Say the word, the truth is spoken
What you gonna do now?
Change your life
What you gonna do now? Change your life
Yeah what you gonna do? At the end of your line
I can see in your eyes
This is your turn
It's all up to you now
Change your life
What you gonna do now? Change your life
So what you gonna do now? Change your life
What you gonna do now? Change your life
What you gonna do now? Change your life
What you gonna do now? Change your life
What you gonna do now? What you gonna do now?
What you gonna do now? (Change your life)
Gonna change your life
What you gonna do now? (Change your life)
Gonna change
What you gonna do now? (Gonna change)
