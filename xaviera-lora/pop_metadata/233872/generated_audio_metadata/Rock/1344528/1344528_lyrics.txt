Shake off your blues, relax a while
Baby don't rush it, you know it's not my style
I must be crazy, you just wanna have a good time
Why don't you let go of your worries, I promise to et all of mine
I had to learn to ignore
The feelings in me that you inspire
Or I'd be jumping out of the frying pan
Into the fire
You must be thinking
Night's a bore
But there is something
I'd really like to underscore
You've got the situation well in hand
If you insist on getting restless
I'm gonna have to make a stand
Now there ain't no sense
I'll pile in trouble higher and higher
Just be climbing out of the frying pan into the fire
It's a chance I don't want to take
Might lead to a fatal mistake
Much as I'd like to satisfy
Sparks are burning those eyes
It's for the best, my lack of concentration
Didn't get beyond the point of total frustration
It was the telephone that finally saved our lives
Cutting me like a dead ringer, sharp as a butcher's knife
Though I got to admit, you are someone that I really admire
We'd just be stepping out of the frying pan and into the fire, into the fire
