So blur that I can't see
So far it can't be me
I can't remember who you are
Between you can't be released
So blur that I can't see
So far it can't be me
I can't remember who you were
Remember who you were
Don't fall apart, don't judge yourself and just follow your heart
And I'll say don't fall apart, don't judge yourself and just follow your heart
Just follow your heart
Don't fall apart
So cold that I can't sleep
So hard I can't resist
I can't remember who I'm made
My body's all I ever made
So cold that I can't sleep
So hard I can't resist
I can't remember who I'm remembered
Don't fall apart, don't judge yourself and just follow your heart
And I say don't fall apart, don't judge yourself and just follow your heart
Just follow your heart
Don't fall apart, don't fall apart (no, no)
Don't fall apart
Don't fall apart, you're amazing
Don't fall apart, you can do it
Don't fall apart, you're amazing
Don't fall apart, you'll still rock it
Don't fall apart, you're amazing
Don't fall apart, you can rock it
Don't fall apart, you'll still do it
Don't fall
Don't fall apart, you're amazing (I'm begging you)
Don't fall apart, you're amazing (You're amazing, baby)
Don't fall apart, you're amazing (Yeah)
Don't fall apart, you're amazing (Yeah, yeah)
Don't fall apart, you're amazing (I say don't fall apart now)
Don't fall apart, you're amazing (I say don't fall apart now)
Don't fall apart, you're amazing (Oh, oh)
Don't fall apart, don't judge yourself just for your heart
And I say don't fall apart, don't judge yourself just for your heart, just for your heart
Don't, don't fall apart (don't fall apart)
Don't fall apart (I'm falling for you)
Don't, don't fall apart (don't fall apart)
Don't fall apart now
So blurred that I can't see
So far it can't be me
I can't remember who you are
This pain can't be released
