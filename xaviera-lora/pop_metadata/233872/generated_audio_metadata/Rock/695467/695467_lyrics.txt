You're a springtime flower
That pops up in the autumn
A shower in the sun
The underdog that won
It's the power of still
When the plug has just been pulled out
The static in your hair
The truth that's in your prayer
You're a jack in the box, yeah
You're a twisted rubber band
A battery that's more than fully charged
You're a cuckoo in a clock and it's eleven fifty-nine
A wave that's gonna crash into a rock
Oh yeah
When the stars align
With the moon and all the planets
Is it a sign that we're okay?
Does it mean we're here to stay?
Or is it someone?
That stays behind the curtains
A hand that draws the lines
A hand that looks like mine
You're a jack in the box, yeah, twisted rubber band
A battery that's more than fully charged
You're a cuckoo in a clock and it's eleven fifty nine
A wave that's gonna crash into a rock
Woah woah
We're a cuckoo in a clock and it's eleven fifty nine
A wave that's gonna crash into a rock oh no
Ah
Weaving to rhyme
Weaving to rhyme
A wave into a rock
