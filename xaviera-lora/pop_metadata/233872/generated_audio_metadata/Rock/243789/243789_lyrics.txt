Close the book and turn the lights out
Our story is coming to an end
Your bitter taste gives way
Away to the sweeter things
The further you are from me
So turn around, walk out the door
I know you've done this all before, alright
Alright
Well et me, et this place
There's nothing left to say, that's right
Goodbye (so sweet to say)
Goodbye (and walk away)
Like old for the new
I'm done with you
Goodbye (so sweet to say)
Goodbye (and walk away)
It's never been better
Since you have left here
Goodbye
Strike a match and burn this house down
Our story is coming to an end
Your sickness gives way to a healing
I see God smiling, smiling down on me
Just turn around, walk out that door
I know you've done this all before, alright
Alright
et me, et this place
There's nothing left to say, that's right
So goodbye (so sweet to say)
Goodbye (and walk away)
Like old for the new
I'm done with you
Goodbye (so sweet to say)
Goodbye (and walk away)
It's never been better since you have left here
Goodbye (so sweet too)
Goodbye (as one goes)
Like old for the loom, I'm done with you
Goodbye (so sweet too)
Goodbye (as one goes)
It's never been better
All since you have left here
Goodbye
