Last night the wind was blowing
Soft sigh right out of midnight
But only morning light could chase away
We're swept into love's caress
We hold the fever and we taste the tenderness
Only love could ever make it stay
Oh, I swept away in the dark of night
Swept away in this lover's light
Under the heat of a full moon
I'm captured by your brown eyes
I hope this night will never end
In the shadows I learned well that this love is just pretend
As the beads of sweat run down your face
Your body trembles in a state of grace
Under the heat of a full moon, yeah
Come morning we may see
More than the dawn
The light of day may show us
All the rights and the wrongs
But the light of day always comes too soon
We held on just as long as we could
Under the heat of a full moon
Ooh, the light of day always comes too soon
We held on just as long as we could
Under the heat
Ooh, under the heat
Ooh, under the heat of a full moon
Under the heat of a full moon
Oh, we'll wash away, wash away, wash away in a lover's lie
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, we'll wash away in a lover's lie
