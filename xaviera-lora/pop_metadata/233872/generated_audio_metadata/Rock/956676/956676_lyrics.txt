Dirty little hip shake
Nothing but a snake and I bite so deep
I go whitey shade to pale as she rattles her tail and I fall asleep
Oh yeah, alright
Oh yeah, alright
Open my eyes, she's telling me lies says her heart's complete
Speaks with a hiss, there's venom in her kiss and
A poison in sweet, I said
Round and around, spinning all around
I've been lost, I've been found
Living underground and I never made the sound
Because of you
Oh yeah, round and around, spinning all around
I've been lost, I've been found, living underground
And I never made a sound because of you
Dirty little hip shake, nothing but a snake and a bite so deep
Ox man, a white shade of pale as she rattles her tail and I fall asleep
Oh yeah, alright
Oh yeah, alright
Open my eyes, she's telling me lies says her heart's complete
Speaks with a hiss, there's venom in her kissing
Her poison is sweet, I said round and around
Spending all around, I've been lost, I've been found
Living underground and I never made a sound
Because of you
Round and around, spinning all around
I've been lost, I've been found, living underground
And I never made a sound, because of you
Round and around, spinning all around
I've been lost, I've been found
Living underground, and I never made a sound
Because of you, alright
Na na na na, na na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na na, na na na, na na na
Because of you, I say na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-nana
Because of you, oh yeah, round and around
I've been lost, I've been found
And I never made a sound
Because of you
Come on round and around
I've been lost, I've been found
And I couldn't make a sound
Because of you
