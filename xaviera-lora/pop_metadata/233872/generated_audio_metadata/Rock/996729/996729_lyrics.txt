I want candy and gravity
I want my days to be numbered exactly
I want elaborate rules, immaculate melody
Blackbird and symphony
I want a room made of windows in a valley in a city where the music can't speak to me
I want elaborate rules, a maculate melody, a black burning symphony
Old time love, kiss the old last
And maybe fire and brimstone and fright and a thing of the past
But if you're willing to learn
I'm not waiting
I'm gonna chase'em
This brilliant light of mine
I'm gonna let it fly
Let it fly
I want candy and gravity
I want my days to be numbed but exactly there
I want a room made of windows in a valley in a city
Where the music can speak to me all time
Love, kiss to your left
And make fire and brimstone and frighten the thing of the past
But if you're willing to learn
I'm not waiting
I'm gonna chase it
With this brilliant lighter mind
I'm gonna let it fly
Let it fly, I'm not waiting
I'm gonna chase it
It's brilliant, lighter now
I'm gonna let it fly, let it fly
