Gather round, inspired Avengers
Let us mould and entertain
Tales of righteousness and the guidance of salvation
Fables of the beasts we've slain
For the foes we've devastated
For the families left for dead
For the hypocrites and their wide-eyed aberrations
And the virtuous days ahead
The dust on the shades mess the blood
Though it fades there's no fading
Once so beautiful, now so meaningless
Mutual plights, methodologies, passions, beginnings
They can't see
All they do, that they're just like you
So here's to lies my brother sold me
Here's to truths I should have known
To awful thoughts and memories, regretful lamentations
Kneel before your consequences, pray
For the seeds we could have sown
The dust on the shades masks the blood
Though it fades there's no thinning
Once so beautiful, now so meaningless
Once bonding dread, one breeds fear
No one sees, no one's winning
But believe in all I do
I'm just like you
Where the line cuts through the chaos
Where it fractures this is your loss
Transparent polar filters are split down the screen
We can highlight just how kindred we seem
The dust on the shades masks the blood though it fades there's no bidding
Once so beautiful, now so meaningless
Reflections of greed, mirrors, not meditations, misgivings
This is real, and for all you knew
He was just like you
