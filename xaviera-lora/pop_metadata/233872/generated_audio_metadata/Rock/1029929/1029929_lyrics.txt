As your broken heart made you fall apart
Are you bursting at the seams?
Are you worn down, beat up, and stepped upon?
Are you wondering what all this could mean?
Are your days in days and your nights not right?
Are you searching for help all alone?
Is it crazy to think such a short time ago
You'd have thought you'd be out on your own
When you cry, hide your eyes
When you cry, hide your eyes
Is your home sweet home when you feel alone?
Are you there but trying to hide?
Say you've tried your best just to fix this mess
Are you sick of yourself and your life?
The light of your life used to shine so bright
Now it's gone dark and so cold
If you'd known just how much you'd feel so down
You'd have left before you'd gotten old
When you cry, hide your eyes
When you cry, hide your eyes
When you cry, hide your eyes
When you cry, hide your eyes
Has your broken heart made you fall apart?
Are you bursting at the seams?
Are you worn down, beat up and stepped upon?
Are you wondering what all this could mean?
When you cry
Hide your eyes
When you cry
Hide your eyes
When you cry
Hide your eyes
When you cry
Hide your eyes
