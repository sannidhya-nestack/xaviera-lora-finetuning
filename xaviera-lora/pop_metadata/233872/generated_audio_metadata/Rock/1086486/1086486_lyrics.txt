If you see me running, babe
Better take that shotgun from the wall
If you see me running, girl
Better take that shotgun off the wall
And if you hear me wailing, you know the blues is gonna call
If you hear me wailing, girl, you know the blues is gonna call
We've been walking with the fire, playing on a razor's edge
Yeah, walking with a fire girl
Running down a razor's edge
The time has come to realize
Our love has burnt this bridge
The time has come to realize
You know our love has burnt this bridge
Coming underneath the radar, moving fast and keeping low
Flying underneath the radar, traveling fast and staying low
Someone's voice is saying, boy you just gotta let her go
Someone's voice is saying babe, you know you just gotta let her go
