Don't wait for tomorrow, it's not better than today
And don't you know tomorrow, today will be yesterday
You can dream, dream what you wanna dream
You can be
Be what you wanna be
Don't think that tomorrow is better than today
Cause don't you know tomorrow today will be yesterday
Things are getting brighter
They're better all around
And things are getting lighter
So pick yourself up off the ground and dream
Dream what you wanna dream and
Be, be what you wanna be and
See, see what you wanna see and
Dream, dream what you wanna dream
