I thought I was wanted, what did I know?
Gave me the green light, green light to go
You showed me the back door, you showed me the road
I'm a backdoor jackdaw with nowhere to go
Out on my own
I'm out on my own in the cold
You got your big house, your ivory tower
Home sweet home has turned into a saw
I'm on the outside, I'm out in the fields
Happens so fast that it doesn't seem real
Out in the fields
Oh
I'm out on my own in the cold
I'm out on my own in the cold
What I was wanted, what did I know?
Gave me the green light, the green light to go
You showed me the back door, you showed me the road
I'm a back door, jacked door with nowhere to go
Out on my own, oh
Oh, I'm out on my own in the cold
Oh, I'm out on my own in the cold
