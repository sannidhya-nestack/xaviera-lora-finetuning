All alone I was waiting
Three thousand miles at sea
I was alone and heard you calling
Calling out for me
I reached out over to you
And washed up on your shores
And now I'm here and I am ready
I could not ask for more and I don't know where I'm going
Or who I'm gonna be and all I know is I need you
I need you here with me
Are you ready to love me?
No, I don't know, no, I don't know
Are you ready to love me at all?
Lying heart, lying with you
Lying in your arms
Too completely deaf and strangers
This feeling is so strong in who you are
And where you come from
It's something that's unknown but we're here and we're together
How could this love go wrong and I don't know where I'm going or who I'm gonna be
And all I know is that I need you, I need you here with me
Are you ready to love me? No I don't know, no I don't know
Are you ready to love me? No I don’t know, no I don’t know
Are you ready to love me? No I don’t know, no I don’t know
Are you ready to love me?
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, are you ready to love me?
No, I don't know, no, I don't know, are you ready to love me?
No, I don't know, no, I don't know, are you ready to love me?
No, I don't know, no, I don't know, are you ready?
To love me at all
