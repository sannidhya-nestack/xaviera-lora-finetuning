Mmm, yeah
I thought that you were craving me
That was my first philosophy
Until I finally got to see
The way you treated me
Illusion couldn't replicate the love
I thought we'd really feel
The magic never seemed to change
To something real
When you were cold
I changed the weather when I
I broke, you turned and walked away
Never should've let you in, never should've let you know
The dream you held over me took all control
I wish I had the strength to leave and
Wish I had the will to go
But somehow I still believed and took that road
I should have known
But I followed, followed, followed
You left me with your subtle charm
Your promises, your camouflage
You took complete advantage of my blind faith
You touched me and said it's forever
I shattered and you looked the other way
Never should've let you in
Never should've let you know
The dream you held over me took all control
I wish I had the strength to leave and
I wish I had the will to go
But somehow I still believed and took that road
I should have known
But I followed, followed, followed
Wherever you would lead
Swallowed, swallowed, swallowed
Whatever lies you feed
Don't know, don't know, don't know
Just how this cloud came over me
I thought that you were craving me
That was my first philosophy
Until I finally got to see
I was so blind
Never should've let you in
Never should've let you know
The dream you held over me took all control
Wish I had the strength to leave and wish I had the will to go
Somehow I still believed and took that road
I'd run anywhere you told me to
I'd run into folded arms
Never should've let you in (let you in)
Never should've let you know
The dream you held over me took all control
I should have known
But I followed, followed, followed
I followed, I followed, I followed
But I followed, followed, followed
