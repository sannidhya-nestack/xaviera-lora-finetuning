I feel so good, you make me high
I feel so good, love never lies
There ain't no doubt about it
You're the only one for me
Yeah baby
You're the light in me
When I'm traveling
Away from home
I feel your love
I'm never alone
Through the fog of life
You help me see
Yeah, baby
You're the light in me
No one could ever hold me
And make me feel alive
The way you do
You ignite my inner feelings
That starts a chain reaction
In me and you
You are the light, the light in me
You are the light, the light in me
You are the light, you are the light
You are the light, you are the light
