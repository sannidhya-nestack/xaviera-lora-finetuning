Baby don't cry
I'm sorry I hurt you
My foot's in my mouth
I'll never desert you
Never ending heartache goes away
It's the truth of the matter
What else can I say
It's gonna get better
It's alright
It's okay
I'm gonna love you anyway
It's alright
It's okay tonight
It's alright, it's okay
I'm gonna love you anyway
Woah
I guess you were right
It's never too easy
To give up the fight
And love like you mean it
Never ending wonder goes away
Who would've figured it all comes around like an open letter?
It's alright, it's okay, I'm gonna love you anyway
It's alright, it's okay tonight
It's alright, it's okay, I'm gonna love you anyway, oh
I never believed it
That time isn't on our side
We can't hide
We can't hide for too long
It's alright, it's okay
Oh, it's alright, it's okay
I'm gonna love you anyway
It's alright, it's okay tonight
Oh, it's alright, it's okay
I'm gonna love you anyway
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, alright, okay, alright
