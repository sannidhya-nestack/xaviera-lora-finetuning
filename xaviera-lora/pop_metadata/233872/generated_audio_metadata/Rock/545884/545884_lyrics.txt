So long all the seasons done
Follow the dusk to dawn
A song for an autumn day
The shadows grow to a deep magenta brown
Cool sun in autumn
A song for an autumn day
Oh the
Of the sky is deeper blue
Wrinkles grow on me and you
There's not much that we can do
What the fall brings
Is the sadness in your eyes
Maybe blue is the disguise
Never grow, be more wise
This I sing for you and it's hidden in the truth
A song for an autumn day
Moving on, oh the seasons fly
You never wonder why
Your song for an autumn day
Maybe years will help you soon to et
If you buy or if you rent
All the lies you did regret
Wonder why
We try so hard to scratch and fight
All these leaves, they never dry
They just float and then they die
We move on, all the seasons die
So long, a song for an autumn day, we're moving on (So long, hope it sings for you)
A song for an autumn day, we're moving on
How long must I sing for you
Orange gold and blue
Deeper gold and blue
How long a song for an autumn day
But how long
This is safe for you (this is safe for you)
In the red and golden trees (how long)
How long (for an autumn day of moving on)
How long (how long) the fall (of seasons goes) a song (for an autumn day)
The moving light (how long) (of seasons goes) a song (the sky)
