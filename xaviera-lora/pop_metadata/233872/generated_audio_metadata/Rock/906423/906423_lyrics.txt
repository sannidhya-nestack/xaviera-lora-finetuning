You were out, I was at home trying on twenty seven dresses
Took me more than ten days to lose you guy
Empty promises filled by this bottle of wine
It's a paid out storyline
I don't wanna sit around watching my life go by
Your stupid little rom-com is taking up my time
Could've had me if you took one knee
But instead you took your time, now leave
I don't wanna sit around watching myself die
So baby let's hit rewind
My birthday came
Blowing out the candles alone
I'll break that picture frame
Along with your copy of
Say Anything
You were always a chick like that now baby
It's a played out story line
I don't wanna sit around watching my life go by
Your stupid little rom-com is taking up my time
Could've had me if you took one knee
But instead you took your time, now leave
I don't wanna sit around watching myself cry
So baby let's here it rewind
Erase, et
Your face and this role you play
Can easily be replaced
And the way we were should be reserved for
Clean out storylines, I don't want to sit around watching my life go by (my life go by)
Your stupid little rom-com is taking up my time (is taking up my time)
Could've harmed me if you took one day, but instead you took your time, now leave
I don't wanna sit around watching myself cry
So baby let's hear it for what I'm not gonna sit around watching my life go by
Your stupid little rom-com is taking up my time
Could've had me if you took one knee
But instead you took your time at me
I'm not gonna sit around watching myself cry
So baby let's hit rewind
Erase, delete
