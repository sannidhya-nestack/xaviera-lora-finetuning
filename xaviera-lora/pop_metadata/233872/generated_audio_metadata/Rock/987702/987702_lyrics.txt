You're a living breathing summertime dream
Toes in the sand and your eyes on me
When the tide comes in we're going out
Down the neon streets where the music's loud
We'll take July as far as we can
You should baby I'm your ocean man yeah
Rum and coke and rock and roll
Easy love and easy go, oh yeah, oh yeah
Love your salty margarita kiss
A hundred proof with a lemon twist
Bad for dancing to boardwalk sounds
Fire me up and then melt me down
When the sun comes up we'll start again
Hey ocean baby I'm your ocean man yeah yeah
Rum and coke and rock and roll
Easy love and easy go
Your blue skies and freedom, freedom
Moonlight and dreaming, dreaming
You and me we're rock and rolling
Easy love and easy go
You're a living breathing summertime dream
Toes in the sand and your eyes on me
When the tide comes in we're going out
Down the neon streets where the music's loud
We'll take July as far as we can
Hey ocean baby I'm your ocean man
