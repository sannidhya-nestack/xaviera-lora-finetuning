Since the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you true
We didn't know our destination
But I knew you'd know just what to do
When our love goes rolling around
It's like lightning comes crashing down
You and I, we got it all figured out
It's like a whirlwind
I can hear you all so clear
You are the voice that speaks to me
No need for imagination
Heart in somewhere meant to be
When our love goes rolling around
It's like lightning comes crashing down
You and I, we got it all figured out
It's like a whirlwind
You got me hard and sore
Until I lose control
Oh no I can't let go
Feels so right
When our love goes rolling around
It's like lightning crashing down
You and I, we got it all figured out
It's like a whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
