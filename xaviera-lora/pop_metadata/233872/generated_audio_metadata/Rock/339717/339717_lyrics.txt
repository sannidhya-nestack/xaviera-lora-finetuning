Fair suit for the ends, young new hand on the wheel
Don't look back'cause trust you's my end of the deal
Ride, ride like a shotgun, dog out in the breeze
Sun's out, it's a high old road, you need to y'all it breathe
Called me for the long haul
Stapped in for a ride
Called me for the long haul
I'm not looking left, I'm not looking right
This road is running to a right
Dive in full direction, words all I need
Stair clip, bear case, picture perfect speed
No use for the rear view, no use for a side
The wind above my window, whistlin' sweetly bye bye
You called me for the long haul
I'm strapped in for a ride
You called me for the long haul
Not looking left, not looking right
His brother's running to arrive
To arrive
His brother's running to arrive
And it's a long haul
Asking for the man's young new hand on the wheel
Don't look back,'cause trust you it's my hand on the deal
Nod, nod like a shotgun dog out in the breeze
Sometimes it's a hot one, roll the lead, the island bleeds
Call me for the long haul
I'm strapped in for a ride
Call me for the long haul
Not looking left, not looking right
Brothers wanted to arrive
To arrive
Brothers wanted to arrive
To arrive
Brothers wanted to arrive
