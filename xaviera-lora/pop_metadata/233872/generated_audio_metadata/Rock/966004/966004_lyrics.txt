She moves through crowd without a sound
Out of sight but circling round
She's had her taste but she wants more
If I were you, I'd find the door
there's a shark on the prow tonight
She's hungry and lean
Shark on the prow tonight
Meanest I've ever seen
I've watched her move with fearsome grace
Disguised those teeth with a pretty face
And I seen her rib on head and toe
Still he's only smiling when she goes
There's a shark on the proud night
She's hungry and lean
Shark on the proud night
Meanest I've ever seen
And she'll take you deeper than you've ever been
She'll show you places you wish you'd never seen
She takes no captives, she don't take no
She lifts them up to bring'em low
And now she's got an eye on you
Her favorite dish, a lover's stew
There's a shark on the prow tonight
She's hungry and lean
Shock on the proud tonight
Meanest I've ever seen
Shock on the proud tonight
She's hungry and lean, oh
Shock on the proud tonight
Meanest I've ever been
