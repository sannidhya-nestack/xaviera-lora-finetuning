Two, three, four
Had her inspired, nailing wood
Thought I did everything I could
Looking back through the chicken shack
Thinking that she's gone for good
Morning sun or midnight sky
We can talk every day or night
She gone back to the chicken shack
I'm gonna make everything alright
Baby's got my number
Yeah, baby's got my number
There ain't nothing I can do
All the things he says are true
Each time you're in the head house, honey
I'll be passing through
Baby's got my number
Yeah, baby's got my number
Well all day, triple eight at nine
It holds the town to the morning light
The fairy leaves just to leave too soon
I'm on the phone all afternoon
Before I speak she erases my mind
And what I need I left behind
Heavy words that don't ring true
Don't call me baby, I'll call you
Baby's got my number
Yeah now baby's got my number
Ain't nothing I can do
All the things you said is true
Each time you're in the head house, honey
I'll be passin' through
Baby's got my number
Yeah, now baby's got my number
Yeah, baby's got my number, baby's got my number
Baby's got my number, baby's got my number
Baby's got my number, baby's got my number
Baby's got my number
