I move through life with a confidence drive
No obstacle too big, no door that I can't pry
I go after what I crave with laser focus
Those who doubt me better have their jaws wired shut
Can try to stand in my way but I'll just push right through
Underestimate me at your cost'cause I'll make you look like a fool
I'm the ultimate boss, calling all the shots
Getting everything I desire, like it or not
I always get what I want, what I want
Don't question it, just watch it unfold
I seize any chance that I'm meant to have
a baddie like me was born to win gold
My mindset's made of pure titanium
No limit in belief so loud and
I manifest no hold barred
Attracting the luxuries that were divinely carved
The haters can roll their eyes all they want
But they'll be eating their words you don't wanna haunt
My aura of success better watch your song
that's my jammy blessing that's rightfully my own
I always get what I want, what I want
Don't question it, just watch it unfold
I seize any chance that I'm meant to have
a fatty like me was born to win gold
Haters can roll their eyes all they want
But they'll be eating their words you don't wanna haunt
My aura of success, better watch your tone
a snatch, any blessing that's rightfully my own
I always get what I want, what I want
Don't question it, just watch it unfold
I seize any chance that I'm meant to have
a baddie like me was born to win gold
It's personal feelings burned from heat onto fire
Fueling an unquenchable ambitious desire
To ascend beyond any superficial ceiling
Surpassing each class hold
Higher I'm feeling
I always get what I want what I want
Don't question it just watch it unfold
I seize any chance that I'm meant to have
a baddie like me was born to win gold
