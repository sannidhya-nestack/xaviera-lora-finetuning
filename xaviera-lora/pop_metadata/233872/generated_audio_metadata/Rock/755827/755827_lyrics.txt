If you fall down, who will pick you up?
And show them what you're made of
Will prove to them they're wrong
Or will you lock yourself away?
Is it better to not feel at all than to feel you've been betrayed?
So what's your choice? I know you don't believe
The trust is only for the weak, the foolish and naive
And you could have everything you want
Just close your eyes and take my hand
We'll prove to them they're wrong
Take a look, it's not so bad
Stop living life in revenge
Live the love of life
Take a look, it's not so bad
Stop living life in the past
Live life loud
You fall from grace, was it what you planned?
You stumble, you fall, you hit the ground
Come on, take my hand
Oh, will you lock yourself away?
Is it better to not feel it all than to feel you've been betrayed?
Take a look, it's not so bad, stop living life in the past
Live life loud
Take a look, it's not so bad
Stop living life in the band
Live love life
Live love life
Oh, oh, oh
