For every time that I get free
Well I may never know who I'm supposed to be
We do enough to get us by
I'm sure it comes as no surprise
How the mighty fall down
Should I lie to you when it meant something?
And bear to lose everything that was right?
But how could you ever feel like I do?
No, I'm not here waiting, I'm just fading
Believe in something that won't change
Into your little world, who is there to blame?
And if there's somewhere left to hide
I know they won't be far behind
The wings may never leave ground
Should I lie to you when it meant something
And bear to lose everything that was right
But how could you ever feel like I do
No I'm not here waiting, I'm just fading
Hey, after you go, then will you know
How I fit in
I'm not gonna try my life passing by alone
And all that we talk about is happy for now
But I'm still here
For every time that I get free
Well I may never know who I'm supposed to be
We do enough to get us by
I know it comes as no surprise
How the mighty fall down
Should I lie to you when it meant something
And bear to lose everything that was right
But how could you ever feel like I do
No, I'm not here waiting, I'm just fading
I'm just fading
