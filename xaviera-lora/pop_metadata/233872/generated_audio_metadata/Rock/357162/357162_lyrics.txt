A cold north wind blew through the branches
Where leaves had taken their rest
A clear blue ocean of sky and horizon
Where birds still gathered their nest
Rest awhile in the arms
Rest awhile in the arms
Rest awhile in the arms
Of your savior
Just rest awhile
Under the oak tree
We buried your ashes
With roses we all had blessed
Beside your beloved
In the arms of your savior
The stone of the family crest
Rest awhile in the arms
Rest awhile in the arms
Rest awhile in the arms
Of your savior
Just rest awhile
Cold north wind blew through the branches
Where leaves had taken their rest
Rest awhile in the arms
Rest awhile in the arms
Rest awhile in the arms
Of your savior
Just rest awhile
