Don't need your company, I want you now and forever
You move me easily, I never ever ever want us to sever
This time I'll do things right and if you promise to be mine
I walk the line (I walk the line) I walk the line (I walk the line)
I walk the line (I walk the line)
I walk the line
I walk the line
My soul burns in the sun
Like a screaming fool alone in the desert
Just say that I'm the one
I'll free your world from every single hazard
This time I'll do things right
If you promise to be mine
I'll walk the line, I'll walk the line, I'll walk the line, I'll walk the line, I'll walk the line
Don't need your company, I want you now and forever
This time I'll do things right and if you promise to be mine
Be down to your life, I walk the line
I walk the line, be down to your life
I won't lie
Just kill my spit and dust
And fill my head with pleasure
Please stop the agony
I will prove you that I'll always treasure
This time I'll do things right
And if you promise to be mine
I walk the line (I walk the line) I walk the line (I walk the line)
I walk the line (I walk the line)
Don't need your company (I walk the line)
I want you now and forever (I walk the line) You move me
I walk the line, I walk the line, I walk the line
