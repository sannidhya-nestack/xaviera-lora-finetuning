Disconnected, twisting wires in my head
It erased me like I never even bled
Screamed silence, can't remember what I said
Erased me'til the memory's dead
Shattered pieces of the man I used to be
Lost reflections tearing back from the debris
Erased me from the pain that I can't see
Erased me, let me fight it, set me free
Erase me, erase me from your mind
Erase where you've just broken what's behind
Erase me from the shadows of your life
Erase me from your foolish life
Erase me from your blooded side
Shadowed pieces of the man I used to be
Lost reflections staring back from the debris
Erase me from the pain that I can't see
Erase me let me finally be free
Erase me
Erase me from your mind, erase me
Leave this broken heart behind, erase me
From the shadows of your life
Erase me free from this trace
Silent echoes of the night inside my brain
Erase me, wash away this heavy pain
True wisdom's driving me insane
Erase me racing down the midnight train
Lost in the chaos, drowning in the dark
Erase me from the past, leave no mark
Haunted visions tearing me apart
Erase me, let me make a new start
Erase me
Erase me from your mind
Erase me
Latest broken heart behind
Erase me
From the shadows of your life
Erase me free me from this strife
Erase me
Free me from this strife
