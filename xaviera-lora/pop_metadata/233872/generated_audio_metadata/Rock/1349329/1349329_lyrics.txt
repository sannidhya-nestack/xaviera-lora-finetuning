Time is passing by and the page is tainted
From these tears in your eyes is a broken sign
As you see them through the mirror
She waits for you till she dies
I'm falling myself in this edge
I'm falling down and I just can't believe
And you cry once again
As she cries and she dies
Waiting alone with this baby inside
And she cries from this cold
She will open the door
From this prison inside
Tears are coming back
And the dream has crumbled
From this guilt in your eyes
And you know the love she has deep inside
Will embrace you
And where was I?
I'm falling myself in this hell (I'm falling down and I just can't believe)
And you cry once again
And she cries and she dies
Waiting alone with this baby inside
And she cries from this cold
She will open the door from this prison inside
And she cries and she dies
Waiting alone with this baby inside
And she cries from this cold
She will open the door
From this prison inside
I feel alive in myself
And it cries
I feel alive in myself
From this prison inside
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
