Day by twisted day
I struggle through my haze
My eating malfunction
Communication lines are broken
Something's wrong with the machine
Trapped inside my time
Lusting for my crimes
Love elimination
Lost infatuation
I've been to both extremes
Something's wrong with the machine (oh yeah, game)
Picking up the levels
Tell me where I've been
Memory banks are jammed
Frozen in my tracks
All my systems out of whack
And it's too late, we broke ground
Make game! Something's wrong with the machine
Again! Bringing up the levels
Raise pain! Sound and sanity
Make game! Something's wrong with the machine
That's right
There must be something blown
Our systems overload
Too much information
Starting isolation
I spiral down into a hole
Break down
Something's wrong with the machine
Overdose
Picking up the levels
Brain, brain
Soul and sanity
Break down
Something's wrong with the machine
What's wrong?
