You were the last one to get to the church
I was the bridesmaid that got to you first
I knew right then and there
It was love at first sight, I swear
We never looked at the bride or the groom
It was like we were alone in the room
We danced, I knew I found a real treasure in you
Just like gold, that's what your heart is made of
Gold, you took this diamond in the rough
Shine me up with your sweet love
Now I am always told that I look good in gold
It's been a year since the day that we met
And I haven't seen a bad side of you yet
You make me wanna try harder
Laugh louder
Love longer
When I have a dark and stormy day
Your love just blows those clouds away
You're always at the end of my rainbow
Just like gold, that's what your heart is made of
Gold, you took this diamond in the rough
Shine me up with your sweet love
Now I am all yours
Always told that I look good in gold
Sha-la-la, na-na-na, oh-oh-oh-oh gold
Sha-la-la
Na-na-na, oh-oh-oh-oh, hey you
This chemical attraction
Feels like a fortunate reaction, hey you
We really hit the jackpot every time
We touch, we hold a love as pure as gold
That's what your heart is made of
You took this diamond in the rough
You shine me up with your sweet love
Now I am always told
That I look good in gold
Sha-la-la, na-na-na, oh, oh, oh, oh, gold
Sha-la-la, na-na -na, oh, oh, oh, oh
