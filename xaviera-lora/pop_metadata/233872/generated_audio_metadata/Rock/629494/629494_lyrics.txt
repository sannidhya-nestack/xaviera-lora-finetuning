Deer mountain, tall mountain, real mountain
Real mountain, blue mountain, my blue mountain
Tall mountain, blue mountain, my blue mountain
Yellow mountain, my mountain, blue mountain
High mountain, deer mountain, tall mountain
Blue mountain, my mountain, yeah my mountain
Whole mountain, my mountain, yeah my mountain
Tall mountain, real mountain, my mountain
Now you suppose the rose is a rose
Now you suppose the rose is a rose
Now you suppose the rose is a rose
Now you suppose
No, you suppose the rose is a rose
No, you suppose the rose is a rose
No, you suppose the rose is a rose
No, you suppose
Rose, oh, why she hurt, dear little bird
Dear little third, dear little water
Brown, so was she her
Dear little third, dear little third
Dear little water
