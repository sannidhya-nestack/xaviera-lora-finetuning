Drowning chemicals
Pollution in the way of life
Exploitation of cities
Traumatising the welfare
Mutation
Consequences of the toxic show
Survival
The human race decumbers to its speed
Mutation
Pollution
Destruction
From this toxic show
Creation
Salvation
Annihilation
From the socks of Job
Traumatized prisons
Bitten in a concussion of dirt
Drank within its turmoil
Living everyday within its forms
Destruction
Life begins to sink before your eyes
Consequence
You feel yourself begin to drink within
Mutation
Pollution
Destruction
From its toxic choke
Creation
Salvation
Annihilation
From assassin Joe
Talk to me, see what works
Nutrition is the new way of your life
This creature you've become
Another victim of the toxic show
Creation
Headed for out into this world
Salvation
Survivors are missing toxic show
Nutrition
Pollution
Destruction
For this toxic show
Creation
Salvation
Annihilation
For the toxic child
