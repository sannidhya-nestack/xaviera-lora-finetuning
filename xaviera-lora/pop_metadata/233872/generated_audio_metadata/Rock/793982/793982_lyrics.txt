My fever's hot, my mouth is dry
You built a fire I can't deny
My life will never be the same
And honey you're the one to blame
My heart murmurs your name
you're the keeper of the flame
You got me lovesick darling
I need your intensive care
You better make it quick cause I need your intensive care
My heart skips a beat I got emotions to spare
Spare me, it's more than I can bear
I need your intensive care
Before I stood, I learned to fall
Before I walked, I learned to crawl
But there's a lesson I never knew
Not until I fell for you
I never knew the lovesick blues
Until you made me pay my dues
You got me lovesick, darling
I need your intensive care
You better make it quick'cause I need your intensive care
My heart skips a beat, I got emotions to spare
Spare me, it's more than I can bear
I need your intensive care
You got me lost here, darling
I need your intensive care
You better make it quick
I need your intensive care
My heart skips a beat, I've got emotions to spare
Spare me, it's more than I can bear
I need your intensive care
I don't feel good
I need, I need your, your intensive care
I got me love sick
You got me love so sick
I need your intensive care
I need your intensive care
I need your
I feel better now
