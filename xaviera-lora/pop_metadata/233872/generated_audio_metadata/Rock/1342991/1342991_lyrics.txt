Midnight miles, radio low
Headlights paint the lines in gold
Wind in lace, a whisper bold
Telling me to not let go
I wore stones like bombs
Blues dance with echoes, kept my pose
If the night wants what I know, I'll give it heart and soul
I won't fade, I won't fold
I'll learn rhythm from the thunder
If love calls, if it pulls
I'll step closer, never under
Spin me a silver thread
Fire round my heart
Pull me through the dark
I won't come apart
Call my name
I'll come back every time you say it
If love is wild when I'm not afraid to sway it
Send me a silver thread
Say it once again
Tie around my heart and I'll find you
I'll find you again
Moonlit charms of moterial glow
Promises on window panes
We were sparks in falling snow
Laughing hard to hide the pain
Kept a map of could have been's
Folded tight inside my sleeve
Every road I ran has been pointing back to you and me
I won't fade, I won't fold
I learned courage from the lightning
If love's close, if it's bold
I'll keep moving toward the bright thing
Spin me a silver thread
Tie it'round my heart
Pull me through the dark
I won't come apart
Call my name, I'll come back every time you say it
If love is a wild wind, I'm not afraid to sway it
Spin me a silver thread, say it once again
Tie it'round my heart and I'll find you, I'll find you again
I know the cost of running
I know the price of staying
But when the night starts humming
I hear our song
No delaying if there's a door in the dark
Leave it open I'm on my way
Spin me a silver thread
Tie around my heart
Pull me through the dark
I won't come apart
Call my name
I'll come back every time you say it if love
Is a while when I'm ready, not a brave end
It's been me, a silver thread
Oh, say it again
Tie it'round my heart
And I'll find you, I'll find you again
Silver thread
Soft and strong
Hold me where I long to belong
On the air, our echoes say
Find me by the silver thread
