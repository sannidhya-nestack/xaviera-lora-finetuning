I'm missing you, missing you
Oh, felt so easy
Caught up in the mood
And emotional night
I can't help it, temperamental fool
Un iving, was that glance
Thought I had the upper hand in the cold light of day
It don't feel so good
When the going gets tough
I'm fading, I'm fading away
In the cold light of day
Now the anger's gone
And I'm all alone
I'm wishing, I'm wishing you'd stay
Instead of walking away
Pure redemption, let me turn back time
I'd be that someone you, you could trust
But we never get a chance to rewind
So I'll sit here and I'll brood
Sinking slowly in my blues in the cold light of day
It don't feel so good
When the going gets tough
I'm fading, I'm fading away
In the cold light of day
Now the anger's gone
And I'm all alone
I'm wishing, I'm wishing you'd stay
Instead of running away, run away
It don't feel so good in the cold light of day
It don't feel so good
When push comes to shove, shove, shove, shove
I'm fading, I'm fading away
In the cold light of day
Merely angles gone
And I'm all alone, alone, alone
I'm wishing, I'm wishing you'd stay
Wishing you'd stay
