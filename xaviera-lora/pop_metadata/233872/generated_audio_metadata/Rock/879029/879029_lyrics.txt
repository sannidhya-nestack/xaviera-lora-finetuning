Even with the sun shining down I feel the rain
Every morning I know right away that it came in the night
I remember when the rivers ran down to the sea
Got a parcel packing heavy on my back like a world of trouble
Gave it to me in a double in a sack
Can't say it's right, but it's right
What I brought down can't hear a sound down to the sea
And the thunder leaves it all asunder to the sea
Like a pissin' packin' mama, alive with all the drama
She don't like a comma, so she'll shoot you down to the sea
Down to the sea
Even with the rain fallin' down, I feel the burn
And the sky turning orange says we're done, we're done
I remember when the rivers ran down to the sea
I remember when we swam up from the sea
Down to the sea
They say she'll shoot you down to the sea
Down to the sea
Even with the sun shining down I feel the rain
Every morning I know right away that it came in the night
I remember when the rivers ran down to the sea
I remember when we swam up on the sea
I remember origin a man up on the sea
Down to the sea
Down to the
I'll take me down to the
