It's a international feeling that we crave
A four letter word anyone can say
The radio is up the frequency is right
Now who's feeling it tonight
If you ain't got it
You got to get it
And if you got it
You got to transmit it, better, better, better, better, better, better
Amplify it, crank that dial up
Turn the love up to eleven
Even though it's been said and done
Every song is already sung
Every thought is already thunk a thousand times
So what?
Amplify it
Crank that dial up
Turn the love up to eleven
Somebody so super cool
Everybody do like we do
Got to amplify the love
If you've been keeping this feeling deep inside
Then you've been keeping someone else unsatisfied
Well now's the perfect time to set your secrets free
And give'em what they really need
They'll never know it
The way you knew it
If you don't show it (show it, show it, show it, show it)
So now you got to do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it (come on)
Amplify it, crank that dial up
Turn the love up to elevens
Even though it's been said and done
Every song is already sung
Every thought is already thunk a thousand times (so fuck what)
Amplify it
Crank that dial up
Turn the love up to eleven
Somethin'bout it so super cool
Everybody do like we do
Got to amplify the love
I can hear it now
It's the love that's gettin' louder tonight
Who can't wait another minute
We're free fallin' in it that's right
Woo-hoo, I can hear it now
It's the love that's getting louder tonight
Do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Amplify it, crank that dial up
Turn the love up to eleven
Even though it's been said and done
Every song is already sung
Every thought is already thunk a thousand times
Amplify it
Crank that dial up
Turn the love up to eleven
Talk about it so super cool
Everybody do like we do
Got to amplify the love
