You're a liar, you're a cheat
You're a dirty little thief
And you're everything I wish I was and more
And you'll steal all my heart
Then you'll break it all apart
Just to watch me pick the pieces off the floor
And I know you seem alright
But it eats you up inside
Just like glass on the wall, you can shine so bright
The shadow, when it all seems right
Just like glass on the wall, I can see right through
So clear I see the real you, and woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just like glass
You're on top of the world
I can see that funny smile
Watch it change direction when you shut the door
You can run, you can hide
All your days with foolish pride
Yet it's coming around to give you what's in store
And they love those pretty eyes (love those pretty eyes)
But I see the tears behind
Just like glass on the wall you can shine so bright
Then shatter when it all seems right
Just like glass on the wall I can see right through
So clear I see the real you will walk
All this time you've been so hollow
Just insecure with your emotions
All this time I see right through
When all I want's a mirror full of your reflection
Just like glass on the wall you can shine so bright
Then shatter when it all seems right
Just like glass on the wall I can see right through
So clear I see the real you
Just like glass on the wall you can shine so bright
Then shatter when it all seems right
Just like glass on the wall I can see right through
So clear I see the real you, oh oh
Oh,'cause life lasts
