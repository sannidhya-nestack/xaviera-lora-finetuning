I wanted to get good at love
And practice makes perfect
I went to the school of hard knocks
Knocking on love's door
That just when I got my failing grade
I took just one more leap of faith
You asked me on that summer day
A movie in the park
I'm walking with you after dark
And things they went from bad to good to great
Bad to good to great
Every day now magical
Since my lucky day
And when my luck changed
You made me sure about it
I want to sing about it
I'm going from bad to good
And good to great
The way you touched your hair in your red v-neck sweater
Well you had me right there, we just had to be together
Just like a kid in a candy store
You keep me coming back for more
Your taste is sugar sweet
From bad to good to great
Every day is magical
Since my lucky day
Boy my luck it changed
And now I'm sure about it
Don't want to live without it
I'm going from bad to good, good to great
If we spend our life together
Each day better than the last
We'll take this life from great to better, better
Bad to good to great and just one date
Bad to good to great
Each day with you is magical
Seems my lucky day
Then my luck it changed, oh-oh
And now I'm sure about it
I've just got to sing about it
I'm going from bad to good
I'm going from bad to good
Bad to good to great
Every day is magical since you came my way
Oh my lucky day
Our love I'm sure about it
I've got to think about it
I'm going from bad to good
And good to great
