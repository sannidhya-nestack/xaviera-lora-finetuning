So winds of change are blowing
I can feel it in the air
Coming from the north and south
I feel it everywhere
So if you love me let me know it
And if you don't fine let me go
Oh I haven't got any time
The swinging from your vines, yeah
So stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me, yeah
Stop me if you think you've heard this one before
Oh, go ahead and stop me
The winds of change are blowing
I can see it in your smile
I hate to say I told you so
I saw this coming for miles and miles
So if you love me let me know it
And if you don't then let me go
Oh I haven't got any time
For swinging from your vine when you're stealing all my lines
So, stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me, yeah
Stop me if you think you've heard this one
Before I go and tell everyone you know
Baby, say that you will kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, yeah
Kiss me baby right here where it hurts
Right where it hurts, hurts so much more than words
Baby don't let me down, baby don't let me down
Baby, baby, don't let me down
The whams of chains are blowing
Through the creases in your face
Yeah, we had such a nice time
But now we've got our own tails to chase
Yeah, yeah
So if you love me, let me know it
And if you don't, then let me go home
I haven't got any time
Oh no, for swinging from your vine when you're stealing all my lines, oh
Stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me, yeah
Stop me if you think you've heard this wonderful idea
Go and tell everyone you know
Baby say that you will
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Kiss me baby right here where it hurts
Oh, oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't let me down
Oh, oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't let me down
Baby, baby, baby, yeah baby, don't let me down
