Each day of the morning paper
Reads like one I've already read
My watch stopped now spins sideways
So tired of looking back
You've always been my better angel
Angel don't hate me when I go
I may take you with me but I doubt it
So please don't follow me there
I need some time to find myself again
So please don't follow me there
Wherever
I feel I've won out my welcome
Burned all my bridges as well
Got a straight ticket to nowhere
Hope no one knows my name there
But you've been nothing but good to me
Which is what makes this so hard
And for that, I'm sorry
I may take you with me
But I doubt it, so please don't follow me there
I need some time to find myself again
So please don't follow me there, wherever
My love we shared so much
Just know I'll miss your touch
You meant the world to me
There's so much world to see
There's something inside of me
That always has to be free
I know I've said it before
But this time it's a different story
I may take you with me
But I doubt it
So please don't follow me there
I need some time to find myself again
So please don't follow me there
Wherever I may take you with me
But I doubt it, so please don't follow me there
I need some time to find myself again
So please don't follow me there
Wherever, wherever, wherever, wherever, oh, hey, oh
Oh, hey yeah, wherever
Oh, wherever
