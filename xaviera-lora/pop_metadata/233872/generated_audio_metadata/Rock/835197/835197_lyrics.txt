What if it never happened
What if it was just a dream
What if your childhood hero never rose
What if his epic story
Fell short of the glory
To pay for milk and braces
And some school clothes
Where would you go? Where would you go?
Where would you go? Where would you go?
But not us baby, not this time
Cause I believe
Yeah, I believe, I believe we're gonna shine
I believe we're gonna shine
The tree falls in the forest
And no one's there to hear
Tell me, do you think it makes a sound?
I believe it does, babe
To me the answer's clear
Let's get up off our asses and look around
Yeah, look around
But where will you go?
Where will you go?
Where will you go?
Where will you go?
Not us baby
Not this time
Cause I believe
Yes I believe
I believe we're gonna shine
I believe we're gonna shine
What if it never happened
What if it was just a joke
What if it was only but a dream
What if the next great prophet
Took everything he wrote
And wrote it merrily, merrily, merrily down the stream
But not us baby
And not this time
Cause I believe
I believe we're gonna shine
I believe we're gonna shine
I believe we're gonna shine
I believe we're gonna shine
