Well I don't have a thing to say
Nothing grabs my attention today
I don't see that there's any need
There's nothing waiting, waiting for me
I go out, but I'd rather not
I used to want to, but I don't feel so hot
It's not the same as it used to be
Something took the
Life out of me
That you see
I'm quite happy
Happy to sit here
Watch TV
I get up
Every day
They bring me coffee
I like it this way
Day turns to night
And everything's the same to me
Used to be out of sight
But now my eyes can barely see
So I wait
For the day
When I'm enlightened
When there's no pain
Take me away
I'll start again
I'll be a rockstar
The party will never end
There's a girl
I used to see
She lived in the next room
But now she's left me
Day turns to night
And everything's the same to me
Used to share our lights
But now my lungs can barely breathe
I don't have a thing to say
Nothing grabs me like in the old way
I don't see that there's any need
There's nothing waiting, waiting for me, oh no
