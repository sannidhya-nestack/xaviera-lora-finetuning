She's the fire and she's desire
She's the news of the world
A perfect smile and a little wild
Well there's nobody like her
She's an original not so typical
And a little naughty but nice
And she's got everything, and got a spell on me
And she's like fire and ice
She's my new American girl
So glad she's good for me
She's my new American girl
Loving what she does to me, American girl
You can't defy her and can't deny her
She's always getting her way
She's living higher, a real live wire
She nearly drives me insane
So photogenically and schizophrenically
She's breaking all of the rules
She's got control of me
Supersonically
I just don't know what to do
She's my new American girl
So bad she's good for me
She's my new American girl
Loving what she does to me
American girl
American girl
So bad she's good for me
She's my American girl
My new American girl
Well you know she turns to me
I don't wanna feel it
she's driving me crazy
Crazy
And I don't wanna see it
But she's simply amazing
Yeah
She's my new American girl
So bad she's good for me
She's my new American girl
Loving what she does to me
She's my new American girl
So bad she's good for me
She's my new American girl
Loving what she does to me
American girl
American Girl (So bad she's good for me)
She's my American Girl (Duh)
My new American Girl (Yeah, look what she does to me)
American Girl (Duh)
My American Girl (So bad she's good for me!)
American Girl (Duh)
My American Girl (Yeah, look what she does to me!)
My new American Girl
