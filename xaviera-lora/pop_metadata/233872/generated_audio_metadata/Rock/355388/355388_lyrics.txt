How do you deal with your eyes closed?
How do you feel when no one's real?
I could've told you there's a burning when you squeal
I couldn't dream what I'm feeling
I couldn't know that I was wrong
Why do you do this when you know that I belong?
So now I throw it all away
Don't believe in miracles
You'd beat me on the dying day
Yeah I love ya but I'm not that crazy
I said I'm not that crazy
I said I'm not that crazy
I said I'm not that crazy
All of the promises broken
All of the dreams are kept inside
I can't believe you
All the passion you've denied
All of my feelings now empty
Let me move on and go with you
I can't believe in all the things that's not in you
Say never throw it all away
Don't believe your miracle
You'd be dreaming of a dying day
You don't love your father
Not that crazy (yeah)
I said I'm not that crazy (yeah)
I said I'm not that crazy (yeah)
I said I'm not that crazy (yeah)
Not that, that
All of the promises broken
All of the dreams are kept inside
I can't believe you all the passion you've denied
So now throw it all away
I don't believe in miracles
You're beating me up a giant day
Yeah, I'm not your boy, I'm not that crazy (yeah)
I said I'm not that crazy (yeah)
I said I'm not that crazy (yeah)
I said I'm not that crazy (yeah)
I said I'm not that crazy
I said I'm not that crazy (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I said I'm not that crazy (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), yeah
