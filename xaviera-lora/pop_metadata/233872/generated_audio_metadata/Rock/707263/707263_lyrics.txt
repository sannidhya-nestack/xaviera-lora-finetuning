Are you gonna be my lover
Are you gonna be my girl
Are you gonna be my woman
Let me be your only thrill
Are you gonna be my baby
Are you gonna let me down
Are you gonna be my honey
And let me lick your sugar pie
Oh girl you make me wild
With your dark brown eyes and your killer smile
Oh girl you make me wild
With your bright red lips and your ponytail
Are you gonna be my lover
Are you gonna be my girl
Are you gonna be my woman?
Let me be your only thrill
Are you gonna be my baby?
Are you gonna let me down?
Are you gonna be my honey?
Let me lick your sugar pie
Oh girl you make me wild with your big black boots and your camo pants
Oh girl you make me wild with your dark brown eyes and your killer smile
Oh girl you make me wild with your white tank top and your chocolate hair
Oh girl you make me wild with your bright red lips and your ponytail
Are you gonna be my lover?
Are you gonna be my girl?
Oh you gotta be my woman
Let me be your running thrill
Oh you gotta be my baby
Oh you gotta let me down
I ain't gonna be my honey
And let me lick your sugar pie
Oh girl you make me wow
With your big black boots and your camel pants
Oh girl you make me wow
With your dark brown eyes and your killer smile
Oh girl you make me wow
With your white tank top and your chocolate hair
Oh girl you make me wow
With your bright red lips and your ponytail
