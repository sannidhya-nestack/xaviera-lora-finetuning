Misunderstanding gets a two-way street
Takes two to tango, it takes four feet
Lesson, baby, you don't know the half
Someday we'll learn back on this and laugh'em
Don't try to say it, don't you say a word
Don't try to say it, don't you say a word
Don't try to say it
Don't you say a word
Well I don't know why
But I can't throw you overboard
You said your way
And I said mine
Two different lingo's
Two different minds
Oh babe we can't go on this way
'Cause if we do then we have to pay
Don't try to say, don't you say a word
Don't try to say, don't you say your word
Don't try to say it
Don't you say a word
Well I don't know why
But I can't throw you up a pole
Now we're back to where we were before
Shut out the windows, we closed the doors
Last remember where you got no clue
There's nothing in your bag of trace that I can't do
So don't try to say it
Don't you say a word
Not a word, not a word, not a word
Don't try to say it
Don't you say a word
Not a word, not a word, not a word
Not a word, not a word
Don't try to say it, don't you say a word
Not a word, not a word, not a word
Well I don't know why but I can't throw you overboard
Can't throw you overboard baby, no
Don't try to say it, don't you say a word (Not a word, not a word, not a word)
Don't try to say it, don't you say a word (Not a word, not a word, not a word)
Don't try to say it, don't you say a word
Not a word, not a word, not a word
Well I don't know why but I can't tell you
Oh for part no, baby, can't tell you over the phone
