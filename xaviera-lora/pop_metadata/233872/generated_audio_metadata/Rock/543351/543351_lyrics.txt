And I hate living in this way
Three years in the wrong place
I know this love of ours is fake
Honey, I can't stay with you
I can't stay with you, this game is through
I can't stay with you, yeah
The best thing you've ever had
Is walking out the door
And you just stare at the floor
The best thing you've ever had
A whole lifetime left behind
And you don't seem to mind
So where am I going with this life?
Downtown in the moonlight
my heart's never gonna die
It's time I did what's right for me
What's right for me, a new life for me
What's right for me, yeah
The best thing you've ever had
Is walking out the door
And you just stare at the floor
The best thing you've ever had
A whole lot's time left behind
And you don't seem to mind
One of these days you'll start to feel the pain
As you realize you're lost, yeah
One of these days you'll start to realize
That guys like me don't come around every day
The best thing you've ever had
The best thing you've ever had
The best thing you've ever had
The best thing you've ever had
The best thing you've ever had
The best thing you've ever had
