I tiptoe by the graves on my way home
The hour's getting late and I'm out alone
I feel a terror that I've never known
I know something's watching me
A distant scream disturbs the eerie night
A chill is spreading to the left and the right
I feel a breath but nothing's in my sight
And I know something's watching me
Don't disturb the dead, just take the long way home
The graveyard path leads to a tomb that is your own
A creepy crawly comes out of the tomb
Emerging from its rotten casket like womb
I'm being chased beneath this werewolf moon
And I know something's after me
But don't disturb the dead, just take the long way home, hey hey hey
The graveyard bath leads to a tomb that is sure old
I feel the monster bearing down on me
Unholy growling from the corpse so beastly
A blinding pain it takes a bite of me
Pretty sure something's after me
Don't disturb the dead, just take the long way home, hey hey
The graveyard path leads to a tomb that is sure old
Don't disturb the dead, just take the long way home, hey hey
The graveyard bad leads to a tomb that is your own
