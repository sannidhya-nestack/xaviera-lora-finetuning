It's baby love on Galilee
And I'm not afraid to fight against the world for you
Fight against the world my baby one of each and a life
Okay, my sweet boy, you are my parachute
With you, I feel so good, you know, you know
I'm gonna get ya, I'm gonna find and get ya
I'm gonna snatch ya, oh!
Come on, oh, here you come closer
Feel my breath now only you
But only you, so do whatever comes to your mind
Better stay with me tonight
But better stay with me tonight and every night
Yeah, yeah, oh
It's made it loud again tonight
And I'm not afraid to fight against the world for you
Fight against the world my baby one
That keeps me alive
Alive now, alive now
I feel alive now, I feel
I feel alive now, I feel alive now, I feel alive now, so alive
Your heart, your heart, your heart, your heart is beating
Your heart is beating, your heart is beating
Your heart is beating loud again and now
And I'm not afraid to fight against the world for you
Fight against the whole world for you, babe
You keep me alive
No matter how it sounds that I know
Afraid to fight and feel the world itself
Your heart tells me I'm right
And no matter what they say
I know it in your heart I will stay moral
