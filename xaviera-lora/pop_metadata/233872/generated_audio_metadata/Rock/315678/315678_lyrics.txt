Circle never ends
We come round again
Through the spiral
Through this dream
Time is like a wheel
Or so it seems
Why do you stand there alone again?
Step out of the shade
It'll be alright
I think I've seen you before
We got time, time enough
we like waiting for the dawn
To find a rhythm of the soul of mine
To find a reason for this song
To find a rhythm, but that's all I'm on
Is your heartbeat, is your heartbeat, is your heartbeat
That keeps me dancing, that keeps me dancing
When all of this is gone
You still remain
And I will never et
Step out of the shade
Into the light
And the music's never gonna end
To find the rhythm of the soul of mine
To find a reason for this song
To find a rhythm for this soul of mine
It's your heartbeat
It's your heartbeat
It's your heartbeat
That keeps me dancing
That keeps me dancing
To find a rhythm for the soul of mine
To find a reason for the song
To find a rhythm for the soul of mine
With your heartbeat
With your heartbeat
Your heartbeat
That keeps me dancing
That keeps me dancing
That keeps me dancing
That keeps me dancing
