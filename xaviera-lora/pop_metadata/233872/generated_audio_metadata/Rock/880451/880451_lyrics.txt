Me and Mona Lisa, standing at the bar
Picking up the people we'd like to go home with
She's a little wild, all the more risque
I'm a little shy, and I'll be alone tonight
I wanna tell her, she's flowing through my veins
The closer I stand, the hotter the flames
Don't you feel something?
Won't you please burn for me?
For me
Hey, little mystery
I'll never stop trying to reach ya
Hey, in a hundred years
You'll still be telling our story
Neon Mona Lisa
Neon Mona Lisa
Me and Mona Lisa, we're sticking to the plan
Keep giving them the reasons we can only be friends
Blowing up their wishes, brushing off their schemes
I'm so tired of fighting it
Baby I just wanna be why you came
What you can't deny, who you're thinking'bout
When you break into that smile
The angels and devils are pulling for us both tonight, tonight
Hey, little mystery, I'll never stop trying to reach ya
Hey, in a hundred years you'll still be telling our story
Me and Mona Lisa
Me and Mona Lisa
What's behind that smile
Tell me are you holding on to a secret
Come on I can keep it
Would I be surprised baby
Or would I be wrecked inside
I wanna know your secret
I wanna know your secret
I wanna know your secret
Secret
Hey, little mystery, I'll never stop trying to reach ya
Hey, in a hundred years you'll still be telling our story
Me and Mona Lisa
Me and Mona Lisa
Neon Mona Lisa
Neon Mona Lisa
Neon Mona Lisa
Neon Mona Lisa
