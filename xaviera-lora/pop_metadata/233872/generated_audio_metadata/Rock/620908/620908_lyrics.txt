Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
This isn't the first time and I'm pretty sure it won't be the last
Cause ever since you came around I've been counting hours down from our future to past
But I, I gotta gotta let go, gotta gotta let go, gotta gotta let go, let go
Yeah I can see right through everything that you do, acting like you don't know
But when the time comes to know you'll be the first one to say I told you so, you so
Gotta gotta let go, gotta gotta let go
Gotta make this life my own
You know you can't stop, baby you never know
So roll down the windows and turn up the radio
You gotta gotta be loud
Gotta make this work out
Gotta pick myself up
Look how you know you can't stop
Baby you can't slow down
They say to live your life right
I'm gonna live my life right now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Like I said in the first line
Just talking about how I'm past the point of turning back
Cause it's the second time around
And no answers can be found for what is fiction or fact
But I gotta gotta let go
Gotta gotta let go
Gotta gotta let go
Let go
Now you turn your head away like you got nothing to say
Acting like you don't know
But when the time comes, I know you'll be the first one to say, "I told you so, you so"
Gotta, gotta let go, gotta, gotta let go
Gotta make this like my own
You know you can't stop me, you'll never know
So roll down the windows and turn up the radio
Gotta gotta be loud
Gotta make this work out
Gotta dig myself up
Look how you know you can't stop
Baby you can't slow down
They say to live your own life
But I'm gonna live my life right now
Lose control, it's never been a better time to free your soul
And I don't think she mind, you know I'd rather be here
Please, please, let me go
Lose control, it's never been a better time to free your soul
And I don't think she mind, you know, I'd rather be here
Freeze, freeze, let me go
Gotta, gotta go, I gotta let it go
Gotta, gotta go, I gotta let it go
Gotta, gotta go, I gotta let it go
Gotta let it go, gotta let it end
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Gotta, gotta let go
Gotta, gotta let go
Gotta make this life my own
You know you can't stop it, you'll never know
So roll down the windows and turn up the radio
Gotta, gotta be loud, gotta make this one count
Gotta beat myself up to ground
You know you can't stop, baby, you can't slow down
You say, "Live your own life right, I'm gonna live my life right now"
I'm gonna live my life right, I'm gonna live my life right now
Live your own life right, I'm gonna live my life right now
