Blinded by the brilliance, you descended on the sky
Reflections of your silver ship, burning my eyes
Sudden bursting sunshine, on the dawn where you came
You went up my mind
I let your cosmic brilliance reign
Then I left my body
Felt your mind extend
Halfway to the moon when the waves end
The ancient hurts I felt beneath your lonely galaxy eyes
Blinded by your brilliance we ascended past both times
Prisoners of the universe
Stolen from their lives
And when he said I could go back
It threw me through the night
Sunburst and sunshine
All of the dawn where you left
Made me et you sooner
In the reflections of your sheet
In the reflections of your sheet
And the reflections of your sheets
And the reflections of your sheets
And the reflections of your sheets
And the reflections of your sheets
And the reflections of your sheep
And the reflections of your sheep
And the reflections of your sheep
And the reflections of your sheep
And the reflections
