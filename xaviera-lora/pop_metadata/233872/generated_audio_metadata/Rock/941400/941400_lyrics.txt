It was ladies night feeling right
Boots on and jeans are tight
Felt I was cooking
And I was looking for a guy to go drinking
Without too much thinking if you know what I mean
Well he was sharp dressed, well pressed
His face was heaven blessed
The way he dances, I'll take my chances
This guy's the reason I'm declaring open season on my heart
Let's do a double shot, ready or not, here I come
You're taking it slow, but I wanna run
We both feel it, but where to begin
What kind of love am I falling in?
We did a line dance on the floor
Heel to toe back and forth
He had the rhythm
And I would give him anything that he wanted
But he liked to take his own sweet time
Back at the bar we got a little bit closer
We started playing and I didn't say no sir
We both could tell that we were laying it on the line
Let's do a body shot, ready or not, here I come
One night with you would be so much fun
We placed our bets, I'm all in
What kind of love am I falling in?
Let's do another shot, ready or not, here I come
Stay up all night so we can wait for the sun
Could this be right when it feels like a sin
What kind of love am I falling in
What kind of love am I fallin' in, yeah
