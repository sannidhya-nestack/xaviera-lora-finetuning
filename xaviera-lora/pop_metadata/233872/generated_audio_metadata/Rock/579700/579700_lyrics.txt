And time can wait
It can be as easy as your love
And oh, I'm clear
It can be as easy as your love
And as you love (as you love)
Break me off a little piece
Give me something to believe
Choking on the cellophane
There's something moving underneath
Screaming for that sweet release
Just to breathe again
And why would you want me when I'm breaking
And why would you want me when I'm gone
And time may wait
It can be as easy as your love
And oh I'm clear
It can be as easy as your love
And why would you want me when I'm breaking
And why would you want me if I'm gone
Baby you got one of mine
Show me what you need if I need your time
And I know it's true
And everything that you do
Tear us all away from this
Break us off a little bit
Looking for the medicine
Who's underneath and how to wait
Looking for the things to say
Just to breathe again
And why would you want me when I'm breaking
And why would you want me if I'm young
And why would you want me if I'm young
