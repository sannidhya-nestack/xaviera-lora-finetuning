We could always be the loveless
We could always be the lonely ones
We could also be mistaken now and then
We could also be a little lost again
We could never know what's going on around
But I will always know why you
Remain a mystery
Just how you wanted to be
I may always be the wordless
I may never have the right things to say
I may not be the hopeless
Romantic that I used to be
So while you're gone I will try not to care
But see how well that works for me
I'll remain a mystery
Just how you want it to be
So take me down
Lay me down upon your weary hands
And take me down
Maybe I'm the one who understands
So take me down
Lay me down upon your weary hands
Take me down
Maybe I'm the one who understands
Take me down
Lay me down upon your weary heads
Take me down
Maybe I'm the one who understands
So take me down
Lay me down upon your weary head
So take me down
