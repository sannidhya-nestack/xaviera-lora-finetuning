He was a cool cucumber not so very long ago
She was a real hot number now moving sorta slow
But they've got a little salsa on the radio
And a double margarita
Well, you never know
Bring it back again (bring it back again)
Bring it back again (bring it back again), if you got a taste for loving
It don't matter where or when
Bring it back again (bring it back again)
Bring it back again (bring it back again, yeah)
Everybody needs some salsa
Every now and then
He was a real smooth talker
Not so very long ago
She was a high-heeled walker
Now moving sorta slow
But if you're a little saucer
With a beat from way back when
And double margarita
They'll be stepping out again
Bring it back again, bring it back again
Bring it back again, bring it back again
If you got a taste for loving
It don't matter where or when
Bring it back again, bring it back again
Bring it back again, bring it back again
Everybody needs some salsa
Every now and then
Now they be couch potatoes watching a late night show
But they still like tomatoes with a little cilantro
And when they make a little salsa with an extra bit of spice
And I share a margarita, man it still feels nice
Bring it back again, bring it back again
Bring it back again, bring it back again
If you got a taste for loving
It don't matter where or who
Bring it back again (bring it back again)
Bring it back again (bring it back again, yeah)
Everybody needs some salsa
Every now and then
Everybody needs some salsa
Every now and then
