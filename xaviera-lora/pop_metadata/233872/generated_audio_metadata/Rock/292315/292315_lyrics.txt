Road goes longer, long along the road of wanting
She holds my heart yet all too loosely
Leaving grief of death, fearing to go further
I think about it and my body starts to moan
With you baby I feel I'm all alone
In your heart my seed of love may never grow
I don't wanna be your dog, stayin' up all night
Playin' little scratch and stamp, I don't know if you're feelin' right
Tell me what you wanna be, tell me what you wanna be
Tell me what you wanna be
Hold me baby, hold me babe, I feel so fine
But your eyes are mirrors, reflecting days of wasted time
One last JD, serve me up my glass of wine
But I don't want to be your dog, you're staying up all night
Playing little scratches now, wonder if you're feeling right
Tell me what you want to be, tell me what you want to be
Tell me what you want to be
