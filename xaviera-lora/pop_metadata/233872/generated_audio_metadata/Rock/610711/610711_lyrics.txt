Cheeks as red as a blooming rose Eyes are the prettiest brown
She's the darling of my heart Sweetest little girl in town
Shady Grove, my little love, Shady Grove I say
Shady Grove, my little love, I'm bound to go away
I wish I had a big fine horse and corn to feed him on
And Shady Grove to stay at home, feed him while I'm gone
Shady Grove, my little love
Shady Grove, I say
Shady Grove, my little love
I'm bound to go away
Went to see my shady grove, standing in the door
Her shoes and stockings in her hand and her little bare feet on the floor
Shady Grove, my little love, shady grove I say
Shady Grove, my little love, bound to go away
When I was a little boy I wanted a Barlow knife
Now I want a little shady grove to say she'll be my wife
A kiss from little shady grove as sweet as brandy wine
And there ain't no girl in this old world that's prettier than mine
Shady Grove, my little love, Shady Grove I say
Shady Grove, my little love, I'm bound to go away
Shady Grove, my little love, Shady Grove I say
Shady Grove, my little love, I'm bound to go away
