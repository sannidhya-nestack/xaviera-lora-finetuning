You say you're testing the waters casting out this line
But baby I need your whole heart to fill this hole in mine
You're cold and empty I say when I burrow in your chest
I thought you loved me don't turn out like the rest
So show me, show me what you can say
You want to know me, we'll find our way
I've been waiting and praying for someone I can see
So show me, show me, show me
Don't let me leave
Your lips are filled with passion when we lay down in my bed
But they don't seem as certain when you leave the woods unsaid
I'm craving just a moment to gaze into your mind
All I'm asking is for a little time
So show me, show me what you can say
You want to nail me, we'll find a way
I've been waiting in pain for someone I can see
So baby won't you show me, don't let me leave
Know that you're in love
And you can't fall asleep
Reality is finally better than your dreams
So tell me everything you need
I'll give you everything I need
So show me, show me, yeah, yeah, oh
They say you're testing the waters, casting out this line
Now you better reel me in, I'll say bye, bye
So show me, show me what you can say
You want to know me, we'll find a way
I've been waiting in vain for someone I can see
So baby won't you show me
So show me, show me what you can say
You want to know me, well find a way
I've been waiting in vain for someone I can see
So baby won't you show me, don't let me leave
Show me, show me, show me, don't let me leave
