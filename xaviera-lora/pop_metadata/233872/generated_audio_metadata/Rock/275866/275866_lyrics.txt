I think I hear voices
I think I hear life
From out of the rubble, one piece at a time
I can use my hands, I still have my life
I've been granted one more day, I can use the light
Surged through the sea of confusion
That used to be, used to be in my backyard
I have seen high water
I see lightning in the sky
Every dream in motion
All along the ocean shore
Convinces me to stay right here
Come hell or high water
We can let the past remind us of the dreams we left behind
Or rebuild our lives together one day at a time
What else can we do? Life will find its way
For those of us left standing, for it is a way
I have seen high water
I've seen lightning in the sky
Every dream in motion
All across the ocean shore
Convinces me to see right here
Kamheller High Water
Kamheller High Water
Kamheller High Water
