Well, I got clothes to wear and a place to sleep
I got a TV and my table, sixty channels to see
I got the scent to warm me and the flowers to smell
I am an open mind being the future is ahead yeah
I call out your name, I saw you reaching for the stars (Reaching for the stars)
Never, never, ever, ever seen an angel reach that far (An angel reach that far)
Never realized the power of your name (Power of your name)
My life won't be the same
Well, I got money to spend and women who wait
But I have found my place, I'm not apt to get laid
I got friends all over and the air too free
But that just don't seem enough when you're beside me
But that just don't seem enough when you're beside me
I call out your name I saw you reaching for the stars
Never never ever ever seen an angel reach that far
Never realized the power of your name
My life wouldn't be the same
My life wouldn't be the same
