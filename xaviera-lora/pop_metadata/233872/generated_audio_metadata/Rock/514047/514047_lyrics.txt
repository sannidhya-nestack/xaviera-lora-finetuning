Only fifteen miles from shore, you'd think we'd see the lights by now
Something's wrong, she said for sure, that's too much rain pouring
Pouring down
And it's high
The arms of the sea are crashing over us
Like an avalanche of a mystery, a mystery
Faith alone guides us now
The wind is rocking us around and round and round
And it's passing over us
The arms of the sea are crying
Like an avalanche of a mystery and I have the touch, I'm the only one you need
I have been through these waters and I've seen what we'll see
And there's a little bit of sorrow, a little bit of pain
But we'll make it through together and find ourselves again, it's all we need
Rain, rain coming down and wash it all away
Our inequalities are rinsing clean
In all the fear, the hopeless pain and denial
Swept into the cold blue below
It's passing over us
The arms of the sea are crashing over us
Like an avalanche of a mystery, and I have the touch, I'm the only one you need
I have been through these waters, and I've seen what we'll see
And there's a little bit of sorrow, a little bit of pain
But we'll make it through together, and find ourselves again, it's all we need
It's all in you, it's all in me, it's all we need
It's all in you, it's all in me, it's all we need, it's all we need
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
You think you know, you think you know it all
You think you know, you think you know it's all
You think you know, you think you know until you're caught up in
Beyond the toe and
You think you know, you think you know it all
You think you know, you think you know it oh
Think you know, you think you know until you're
Caught up, caught up in it
Caught up in it
