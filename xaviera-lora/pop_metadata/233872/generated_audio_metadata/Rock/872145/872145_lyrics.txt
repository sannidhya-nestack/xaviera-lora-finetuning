You look the other way
Like you were trying to say
I've never been here, I'm dying for your arms
We took a shortcut
Skipped all the good parts
In front of problems I get lost forevermore
Take me, et about yourself
Leave me to take care of your soul
Please live, no matter where we are
Wake me, for dreams along the way
So wake, embrace another face
Somewhere where everything is fine
It took a slow start
But then it took off
Like a battle we were flowing with the wind
This is the last stop
Along the boardwalk
We'll walk into the time here saying it's goodbyes
Take a day, et about yourself
Leave me to take care of your soul
Please live, no matter where we are
Awake me from dreams along the way
So we embrace another face
Somewhere where everything is fine
I've been telling stories all my life
But this one contains goodbye
Take me, et about yourself
Leave me to take care of your soul
Please live, no matter where we are
Take me, et about yourself
Leave me, to take care of your soul
Please live, no matter where we are
Wake me, from dreams along the way
So wait, embrace another face
Somewhere, where everything is fine
