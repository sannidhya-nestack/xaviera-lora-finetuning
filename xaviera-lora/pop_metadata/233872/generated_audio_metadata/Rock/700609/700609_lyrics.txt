I was drawn in
I was drawn into a lie
I had to leave it
Had to leave it all behind
Not what I had in mind
And I'll be standing where the love lies down
And the streets don't fuss over me
And I'll be waving taxis all the way
Just know I'm to me girl
I was sold this, I was sold this bag of hope
When all I needed, all I needed was some room
But I don't want to go
I'll be standing where the love lies down
And the streets don't fuss over me
I'll be waving taxis all the way
Catch the one
Feel me girl
I'm waking from a dream
What I don't believe
My head is in the ground
Feel I'm coming down
When I wake up
When I wake up at the dawn
When I crawl out
When I crawl out of my home
And do it all again
And I'll be standing where the love lies down
And the sheets don't fuss over me
And I'll be waving taxis all the way'Cause the world is in the air
