I tried to walk away, gotta leave this place
Then you hit me in the face like a boomerang
Threw you to the sky, said all my goodbyes
Then you hit me in the face like a boomerman
Like a boomerang
When it started
I loved you and you loved me
Now it's all changed
You've become this control freak
Like before I go out
You're telling me what time to get home
And now every day I feel the walls are closing in
I try to walk away, gotta leave this place
Then you hit me in the face like a boomerang
Threw you to the sky, said all my goodbyes
Then you hit me in the face like a boomerang
Can you hit me in the face like a boomerang?
Say it only
Take my phone calls, read my mail
All my friends say
I'd be better off in jail
So I better get out
Throw my life into a suitcase
And you know this time I'm changing my identity
I tried to walk away, gotta leave this place
Then you hit me in the face like a boomerang
Threw you to the sky, said all my goodbyes
Then you hit me in the face like a boomerman
Try to run away, find a place to stay
Then I see you right behind me
Gonna emigrate, leaving outer space
Join the circus so you can find me
Like a boomerang
Try to run away
Find a place to stay
Then I see you right behind me
Don't wanna emigrate
Living out of space
Join the circus so you can find me
Try to walk away, gotta leave this place
Then you hit me in the face like a boomerang
Threw you to the sky, said all my goodbyes
Then you hit me in the face like a boomerang
Try to walk away, gotta leave this place
Then you hit me in the face like a boomerang
Threw you to the sky, said all my goodbyes
Then you hit me in the face like a boomerang
Try to walk away like a boomerang
Try to walk away like a boomerang
Try to walk away gotta leave this place
