Got up this morning, ooh, and you were on my mind
I'm real lousy, I've got to stop wasting time
Just tell me everything you need, and I will be there by your side
'Cause I wanna be a man
Yeah, I wanna be a man
Whatever it takes, I'll do all that I can
Oh, angel baby, ooh, what do I gotta do?
Oh, you know, baby, that I'd do anything for you
I've got to have you here'cause I love those things you do
I wanna be your man
Yeah, I wanna be your man
Whatever it takes I'll do all that I can
I think of you in the morning
And when I go to bed
I dream about you baby
You're taking me straight to heaven
With those little things you do
I'm captivated by your spell
My love I'm reaching out to you
'Cause I wanna be a man
Yeah, I wanna be a man
Whatever it takes, I'll do all that I can
Oh yeah, I wanna be a man
