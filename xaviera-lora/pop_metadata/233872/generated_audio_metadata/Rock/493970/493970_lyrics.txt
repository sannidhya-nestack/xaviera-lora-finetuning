All your pretty things out on display
All the ugly things are tucked away
Trying to pretend that you're alright
But you know your soul is dark as night
All of the things you do
Come pushing down on you
Maybe one more little white lie
Will get you through
Big white elephant is in the room
Mr. Perfect left you in the gloom
Six months come and go
You're by the phone, ooh, yeah
You hide the fact you're desperately alone
All of the things you hide
They beat you up inside
Maybe one more little white lie
Will get you through
A little white lie
Oh, all of the things you do
Come pushin' down on you
Maybe one more little white lie (one more little white lie)
One more little white lie (one more little white lie, one more little white lie)
Maybe one more little white lie (one more little white lie, one more little white lie)
Will get you through
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, don't be ready for the kid
Leaving him in such a bitter pill
Got your friends behind you but
You're chickened out, oh and
Thought you couldn't face a life that was without him
All of the things you spent
When will it ever end?
Maybe one more little white lie
We'll get you through
A little white lie (little white lie)
A little white lie (little white lie)
A little white lie (little white lie)
When you say it's fine with you and your guy
That's a little white lie (little white lie)
Oh, a little white lie (little white lie)
The truth in your eyes, you're not fooling me with your little white lies (little white lies, little white lies)
