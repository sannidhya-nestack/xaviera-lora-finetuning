You see that man, see what he paid me, see what he made me do
You see that band, they really slayed me, see what they made me do
Do I like the way you hold me down?
Like you do
Ooh, I could never put you down
I really need to
Remember when
You tried to please me
The lies came easily
Remember when
You used to love me
From miles above me
Do I like the way you hold me down
Like you do
Ooh, I can never put you down, I really need to
La la lai, la la lai, la la lai lai, la la lai lai, ooh
Do I like the way you hold me down?
Do I like the way you hold me down?
Do you like the way you hold me down? (Do you like the way you hold me down?)
Do you like the way you hold me down?
Remember me? (Get it on)
I used to love you (Right away)
Miles above you (Last gasp)
Now (Redeemer)
Remember when? (Take me back on)
You tried to please me (Sweetly please)
The lies came easy (Because I love you)
Now (It's been what you done)
Ooh, do I like the way you hold me down?
Do I like the way you hold me down
Do I like the way you hold me down
Do I like the way you hold me down
Mmm, I like the way you hold me down
Do I like the way you hold me down
I like the way you hold me down
