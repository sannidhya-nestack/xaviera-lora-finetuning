Open
I know you're ahead of me
And I don't know
Where it's leading me
It don't matter
I made a promise to you
I made a promise to you
I wanna see you through
And when I'm through
I'll come back to you
You're the one I left behind
Like a song floating in my mind
I made a promise to you
I made a promise to you
I wanna see it through
And love
I made a promise to you
I made a promise and when I'm through
When I'm through
I'll come back to you
I made a promise to you
I made a promise to you
I wanna see it through
Hello
I made a promise to you
I made a promise and wait
I'm through
Wait, I'm through
Come back to you
Come back to you
