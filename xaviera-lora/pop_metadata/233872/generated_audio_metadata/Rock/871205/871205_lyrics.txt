How do I make things better
How many sips'til you're gone
People all tell me et her
But I don't know, maybe they're all wrong
How do we become
The people we become
And how do I make you care?
I can't undo
All those things I've done to you
The great I told you so
Hovers in the air
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone
Stop you waiting
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone
Stop you waiting
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone
Stop you waiting
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone
Stop you waiting
Stared in here we were astonished
Like a sleepy dug up whale
It's not the life I was promised
Doing my messed up notes and my travel plans
Why are we always dreaming of water?
Why is it always taking away?
Maybe it's proof that we oughta
Maybe settle down
Tuck those dreams away
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone (stop you waiting)
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone (stop you waiting)
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone (stop you waiting)
She's gone, she's gone
I would've kissed you every hour, every minute of the day
If I knew that someone else was calling you away
I would've kissed you every hour, every minute of the day
If I knew that someone else was calling you away
Calling you away
Calling you away
