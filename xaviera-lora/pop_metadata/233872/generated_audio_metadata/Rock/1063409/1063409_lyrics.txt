He's a waste of tears
Now he ain't worth the break up breakdown happening here
So just let him go
I hate to see you cry
I hate to see your trust in heart with just any guy
And I promise you, oh
Somebody's gonna treat you right
Somebody's gonna make it easy
Say goodbye to the lonely nights
And when guys are lining up, be lean
But I got somebody perfect
To give you the love you're deserving
When you're ready, you can call me, oh, oh
I know somebody
Who you know where I am
When you need a friend or pour something strong with a steady hand
Oh day or night
When the time is right
When you're looking for that something more you'll see it in my eyes
You're somebody, yeah
Somebody's gonna treat you right
Somebody's gonna make it easy
Say goodbye to the lonely nights
When guys are lining up and leaving
But I got somebody perfect
To give you the love you're deserving
When you're ready
You can call me, oh, oh
I know somebody
Somebody here waiting
Somebody who ain't going nowhere
Yeah I'm here waiting
But I ain't going nowhere
Somebody's gonna treat you right
Somebody's gonna make it easy
Say goodbye to the lonely nights
Somebody's gonna treat you right
Somebody's gonna make it easy
Say goodbye to the lonely nights
And then guys are lining up and leaving
But I got somebody perfect
To give you the love you're deserving
When you're ready, you can call me, oh, oh
I know somebody
