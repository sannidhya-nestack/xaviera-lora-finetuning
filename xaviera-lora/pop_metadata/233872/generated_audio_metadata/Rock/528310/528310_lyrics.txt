Breathing easy wasn't hard for me
Now I'm as anxious as a girl can be
I cannot find the perfect dress to wear
Instead my makeup makes me stop and stare
We were texting with no promises
But it was changed after your goodnight kiss
So confused about the message you send
'Cause I don't really want this thing to end
If this is good as it gets, I just wanna quit
If there is more than meets the eye, I'm just gonna cover up
I'm a girl gone and I'm gonna lose
And when a girl's gone, well she's not ready for rejection
Like a girl gone, well I'm in need of full attraction
a girl gone, well we'll be waiting for the break she'll give tonight
Something inside told me to get into your game
But I'll be playing just for fortune and fame
My intuition tells me not to let go
For we never know how the dice will roll
If you ever wanna change your mind
Please don't leave me feeling high and dry
I'm gonna give it all I've got
It's not sufficient just to give it a shot
If it's as good as it gets, I just wanna quit
If there is more than meets the eye, I just gotta go for it
I'm a girl who don't want it, I'm gonna lose direction
And when a girl's gone, she's not ready for rejection
Like a girl who don't want it, I'm gonna need a full attraction
'Cause a girl gone wild will be waiting for the break she'll give tonight
It's like a criminal desire
And I'm looking for a smoking gun
Your pile of evidence is getting higher
And beyond the shadow of a doubt
You can't fulfill the burden of proof
'Cause I'm a girl gone and I'm gonna lose direction (Girl gone now)
I'm gonna lose direction (Nobody goes home while she's not ready for rejection)
She's not ready for rejection
Girl gone and I'm gonna lose direction (I'm gonna lose direction baby)
Nobody goes home while she's not ready for rejection
'Cause the girl I will be waiting for, the break she'll give tonight (yeah, yeah, yeah)
the girl I will be waiting for, the break she'll give tonight (she'll give tonight)
