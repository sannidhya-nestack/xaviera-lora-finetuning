She walks downtown with a red dress on
Late at night with her mind half gone
Come the morning she hides her face
In the lines of shame time can't replace
Her name was Memphis born in Albany
The prettiest girl Tommy ever had seen
He'd only loved Memphis and his love was strong
Even loved her late at night with her mind half gone
Cry, cry, Memphis
Tommy bought Memphis a wedding band
He cried, "Let me be your one and only man"
I love you, Memphis, with a love so blind (with a love so blind)
I'm begging you to leave that world behind
Memphis cried, "Tommy, now don't you know?"
You can't make love with a heart of stone
Time will pass and then you'll see
I'm not the woman that you want me to be
No, I'm not the woman that you want me to be
And he cried in Memphis
Please come home
I need crying man first
Don't leave me alone, no
Tommy fell down on his knees as Memphis jumped into that white limousine
One last look is all she gave and he knew he'd never see
Memphis again
And he cried, "Ay, Memphis, please come home"
And he cried Memphis
Don't leave me alone now
Cry Memphis
Cry
Rhyme in fix, rhyme, rhyme in fix, rhyme in fix
