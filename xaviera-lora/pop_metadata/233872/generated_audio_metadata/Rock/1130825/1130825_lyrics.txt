Sittin' in the sand, soakin' up the sun
Hula skirts swayin' to the beat of the drummer
Happy hour at three, time to shake that tree
Catch a coconut for you and me
Come on and shake it'til it drops
Do the coconut rock
The coconut rock (the coconut rock)
The coconut rock (the coconut rock)
Come on and shake it'til it drops
Do the coconut rock
Everybody get a grip, shaking them hips
Catch a coconut with your fingertips
I'll swing that machete, pucker down my lips
Slide in a straw and take a sip
Time to party round the clock
Do the coconut rock
Surfers hoppin' to catch a wave
Snorklers bobbin' to chase a babe
Well along comes a dorsal fin circlin' about
Someone yells, "Shuck !"
Time to get out, time to run, not walk
Do the Coconut Rock
The Coconut Rock (the Coconut Rock)
The Coconut Rock (the Coconut Rock)
Time to run, not walk
Do the Coconut Rock
Shake it to the left, shake it to the right
Shake that tree with all your might
Shake it to the right, shake it to the left
Don't let the coconut hit you in the head
Shake, rattle and pop
Do the coconut rock
The coconut rock (the coconut rock)
The coconut rock (the coconut rock)
Shake, rattle and pop
Do the coconut rock
Time to run not walk
Do the coconut rock
Time to party round the clock
Do the coconut rock
Come on and shake it till you drop
Do the coconut rock
Oh yeah
