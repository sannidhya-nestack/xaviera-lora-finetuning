She's got a weird way to show she loves you
Just another lie, another pretty face I'm hanging on to
With words'bout the weapons she will use to cut me down
Time to walk away before I start to say what's on my mind
There's a lot I could say to bring you down
But I won't go with you there right now
Yeah, there's a lot I could say to bring you down
But I won't go with you there right now
Yeah, yeah
I guess it's time to swim inside that ocean of lies
I don't wanna stay on this path she's got me on
We keep on getting high to make it go away
Though the truth will stay the same
Time to walk away before I start to say what's on my mind
There's a lot I could say to bring you down
But I won't go with you there right now
Yeah, there's a lot I could say to bring you down
But I won't go with you there right now
Yeah, no, I won't go, no
No, I won't go, no
No, I won't go, no
No, I won't go, no
No, I won't go, no
No, I won't go, no
No, I won't go, no
No, I won't go
