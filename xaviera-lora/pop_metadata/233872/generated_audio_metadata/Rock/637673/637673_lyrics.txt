So life's a game, when can we play with yours?
With just a flick of the needle, we're sure to best our scores
And as the fades, I'll veil our skins
It's a mark for the ages
Let the games begin
Can you feel it?
Make some noise
Let me hear it
Raise your voice
Fifteen fading or ripped away
We've all got something to say
Is there a voice that whispers on the wind?
A subtle symptom of conscience
Of cold indifference thinned
It's the world that lights my tongue
For self-indulged reservations
Not what we've become
Can you feel it? Make some noise
Let me hear it, raise your voice
Fifteen fading, rips away
We've all got something to say
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? Make some noise
Let me hear it, raise your voice
Fifteen fading rips away
We've all got something to say
