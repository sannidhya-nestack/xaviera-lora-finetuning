I've got so much up here to say
There's not enough air and way too much ego
The room is so small we'll explode
It's spinning, you're out of control
Wake me up when you're out and you're over it
Bite your tongue, hold your breath just a little
You get what you've given
But you are the reason that everyone else is concerned
And that's when she said
It's never another
And that's when she said
Never not ever again
Never not ever again
And say what you mean
Say what you're thinking
Just don't say nothing
It's so much deeper than you think
I was damned if I did
But damn it I did it
You took down the ball
I furred all the lawn
But I'm vegetarian
Shut your mouth now you don't know the half of it
Take me out, grab the bench for the season
Careful proceeding there's never hard feelings
Just a few poor choice of words
And that's when I knew it was never enough
And that's when I screamed
Never not ever again
Never not ever again
And say what you mean, say what you're thinking
And just don't say nothing
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough
I've got so much up here to say
Never not ever again
Never not ever again
And say what you mean, say what you're thinking
Just don't say nothing
And just don't say nothing
