I hear footsteps approaching the door
Put my hands on my head'til it all goes away
From this dimly lit room that we're in
Shadows move on the floor as we're wasting away
We've been grinding our bones out for years
Side by side eye to eye in 1929
We've been stranded alone now for years
Should I stay will I die in 1929 storyline
All this talk about running away makes me laugh when I realize there's nowhere to go
What was once an acceptable home turned to dry rotting wood where the weeds overgrow
Children play in the alleys below
Broken bricks and tin cans disappear in the snow
Winter sun for an hour or so
Brown and grey are the bands in our darkened rainbow
We've been grinding our bones out for years
Side by side eye to eye in 1929
We've been stranded alone now for years
Should I stay or will I die in 1929's story line
We've been grinding our bones out for years
Side by side eye to eye in 1929
We've been stranded alone now for years
Should I stay will I die in 1929 storyline
Should I stay or will I die a 1929 storyline
Should I stay or will I die a 1929 story line
