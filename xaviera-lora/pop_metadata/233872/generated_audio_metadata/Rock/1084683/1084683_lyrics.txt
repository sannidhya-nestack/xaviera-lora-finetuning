One, two, three, four, five
We can drive up to Bixer, send out a post
Card picture, climb the mountains
Looking for a panoramic view
We can hit every night spot, every five star restaurant
But you know honey nothing beats doing nothing with you
Richie rimshot only wing me
Take that Cajun beat and sting me
Doing nothing's everything to me
Throw a big blanket out on the lawn
Watch them shooting stars till dawn
Doing nothing makes me feel so free
Had a lot of bit easy people and such
I hurry hauling around
Their worries someone needs
To tell them it's okay to take a break
People who call me lazy
They can go push up daisies
I don't really give a hoot
I'm doing nothing, nothing new
And I'm doing nothing with you
Rick J. Rimshot only wing me
Take that Cajun beat and sting me
Doing nothing's everything to me
Throw a big blanket out on the lawn
Watch them shooting stars'til dawn
Doing nothing makes me feel so free
And a lot of it easy
We can go watch the swallows fly back to Calestrano
Someone told me this year they're a little overdue
Or we can drive down to Reno
Don't matter much where we go
you know, honey, nothing beats doing nothing
Nothing do when I'm doing nothing with you
Doing nothing, nothing to and I'm doing nothing with you
