I won't let you take us back to the year zero
This sweet perfume in my heart
This light it won't let you
They say women hold up half of the sky
My sweet love, our country needs both you and I
My sweet love, our country needs both you and I
I won't let you take us back to the year zero
This sweet perfume in my heart
This light won't let you
We say in darkness we can see the stars
My sweet child
Our country needs your beautiful voice
These holy men, these thieves and liars
Tellin' us we've got to fight
Where does it say I've got no right to love my country?
They speak my mind
I won't let you take us back to the year zero
This sweet perfume in my heart
This light it won't let you
I won't let you take us back to the year zero
This sweet perfume in my heart
This light it won't let you
I won't let you take us back to the year zero
This wildfire in my blood
This love it won't let you
