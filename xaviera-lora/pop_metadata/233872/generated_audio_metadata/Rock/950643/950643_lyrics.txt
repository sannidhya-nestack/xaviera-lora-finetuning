My sweetie, sweetie, Jell-O-Pin, let's play
I'm living the bar, you're following me (oh, oh, oh, oh)
You think I'm a star, you're my Jell-O-Pin (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm rocking on stage, you're jumping the crowd (oh, oh, oh, oh)
When I look at you, your feet can't feel the ground
And you say I'm another kind, oh
Am I the only one you've ever drowned?
Lights play, lights out
Be my jelly bean tonight
Lights play, lights out
Be my jelly bean tonight
You gotta be crazy
You gotta be crazy about me
You gotta be crazy
Be my jelly bean tonight
After the show you waited back door
Ah ah oh oh oh
Your confessions of love make me so bored
Ah ah oh oh oh
I'm not your girl and you're not my knight
No, no, no, no, no
I just wanna have fun with you tonight
And you say I'm a number kind
Am I the only one you ever wanted?
Lights play, lights out
Be my jelly bean tonight
Lights play, lights out
Be my jelly bean tonight
You gotta be crazy
You gotta be crazy about me
You gotta be crazy
Be my jelly bean tonight
Oh baby, you're so sweet
Be my jelly bean tonight
Tonight, be mine, tonight
Be mine, be mine, be mine
Lights play, lights out
Be my jelly bean tonight
Lights play, lights out
Be my jelly bean tonight
You gotta be crazy
You gotta be crazy about love tonight
You gotta be crazy
Be my jelly bean tonight
My jelly bean tonight
My jelly bean tonight
My jelly bean tonight
Be my jelly bean tonight
Jelly jelly bean moon
Jelly jelly bean moon
Be my jelly bean tonight
