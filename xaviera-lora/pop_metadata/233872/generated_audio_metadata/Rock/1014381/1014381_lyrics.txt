Bullet flew right through his hand
Would be a problem if he stayed
He said to me don't you worry
But I worried a long time before that
He was trouble, oh
He was trouble, oh
No one knows that it was me
But I would do it all again
If they ever found out
I would say it was self defense
It was trouble, ooh
It was trouble, ooh
No, I won't see your shady ways ever again
he was not, oh no, he was not a good man
He was trouble, ooh, he was trouble, ooh
I took a risk, but let me tell you, you won't be missed
Maybe just by mistresses
I was fooled and amused
Broken and confused
I can't breathe again
Oh, I can't breathe again
Trouble, ooh
He was trouble, ooh
No one will see his shady ways ever again
he was not, oh no, he was not a good man
He was trouble, ooh
He was trouble, ooh
