Same old story we've heard before
A suitcase packed, note on the door
What did I do, what went wrong?
Oh it don't matter when it's all said and done
Mmm, thought I'd finally found the man of my dreams
But love on the surface ain't all what it seems
How I believed he was the one
Oh, it don't matter when it's all said and done
Yeah when it's all said and done
What can you sing
What can you rub on
You can make a new start
Looking forward from where you are
When it's all said and done
Time goes by and I hold no blame
Lessons are learned through trial and pain
One chapter ends, another's begun
Life goes on when it's all said and done
Yeah when it's all said and done
What can you say?
Where can you run?
You can make a new start
Looking forward from where you are
When it's all said and done
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah when it's all said and done
What can you say
Where can you run
You can make a new start
Looking forward from where you are
When it's all said and done
When it's all said and done
Da da da da da, da da da da da, it's all done
