Flowers bloom and seasons come
Thought you've owned me all along
Breathe me in and bone me out
Stupid lovely spirals
I don't wanna live your life
You know why
I'll say it that night
You stoked the fire and watched it die
Tell you what's inside my head
You'll never be my man
'Cause you don't understand
You'll never be my man
Now that it's been on my mind
I see you clearly, I'm not blind
Chew me up and spit me out
Stupid lovely spirals
I don't wanna live your life
You know what I said that night
You stoked a fire and watched it die
Tell you what's inside my head
You'll never be my man
'Cause you don't understand
You'll never be my man
You think I'm hiding
But I'm not crying over you
It was perfect timing
Oh, to tell you
While I'm dancing in my head
You'll never be my man'Cause you don't understand
You'll never be my man
