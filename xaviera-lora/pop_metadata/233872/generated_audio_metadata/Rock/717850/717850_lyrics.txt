Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
For those who have no morals these ethics lie before you
But I can't leave this numbing state of mind
For those who think this act is just an act of kindness I think you'll breathe
What's drowning in your waters? I think you'll breathe
What's dying in your bed?
For those who think this act is just an act of kindness
I think you need a radical solution
I think you need a clever way to sleep
In the sounds, in the sounds (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I will burn
In the sounds, in the sounds (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I will burn
For those who have no morals
These ethics lie before you
But I can't live
This numbing state of mind
In the sounds, in the sounds
I will burn, girl
In the sounds, in the sounds
In the sounds, in the sounds
Natural cookie cutter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the sense, in the sense
That you're cookie cutter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, do-do-do-do-do
I'll go, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
