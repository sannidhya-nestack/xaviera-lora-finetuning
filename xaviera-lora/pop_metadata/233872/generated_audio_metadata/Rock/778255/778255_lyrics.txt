I think I lost a little part of me
That day you left on that crowded street
I can read the pages of engaging minds
A million lines, I'm wasting time
'Cause when I see your eyes I get lost inside
If I could find the words that would make you stay
Ooh, if I could tell you somehow
'Cause there's so much more that I have to say
Ooh, if I could find the words now
I won't et the way you made me feel
It was more than real, why'd you have to steal?
Little and biggest world all rolled in one
This web we spun has come undone
I never felt so weak when I tried to speak
If I could find the words that would make you stay
Ooh, if I could tell you somehow
'Cause there's so much more that I have to say
Ooh, if I could find the words now
I'd lost my breath
If you could hear the thoughts inside my head
You'd know I still love you
You know I still love you
If I could find the words
That would make you stay
Ooh, if I could tell you somehow
there's so much more
That I have to say
Ooh, if I could find the words now
Ooh, if I could find the words now
