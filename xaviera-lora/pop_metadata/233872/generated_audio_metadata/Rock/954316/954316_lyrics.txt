Heading out of the station
Got time on my hands
With a head full of questions
That didn't go to plan
I always believed
Stay true to your word
You promised the world but you never delivered
Always walking a tightrope
Like a bird on a wire
Never knew where I stood girl
Got stuck in the mire
But I couldn't believe
All those rumors I heard
You promised the world but you never delivered
You promised the earth sold me down the river
It's so easy to be a fool
Tripping over and falling through
Why did I take you at your word?
Should have stayed by my side
When you promised the earth
I'm going to go ahead and close this out.
I'm going to go ahead and close this out, and I'll see you guys later.
It's so easy to be a fool
Tripping over and falling through
Why did I take you at your word?
Should have stayed by my side
When you promised the earth
It's so easy to be a fool
Tripping over and falling through
Why did I take you at your word?
Should've stayed by my side
When you promised the earth
Should've stayed by my side
When you promised the earth
Should've stayed by my side
When you promise the earth
