Put on your dancing shoes
Feel the rhythm in your toes
Move to the beat don't lose
Life's a party let it flow
Music my heart's in flight
Underneath the disco light
Twist and turn through the night
Feel the joy, feel the light
Can't see shoes, dancing shoes
We'll lose your worries, lose your blues
Step by step, no excuse
Let the music be your muse
Everyone around is glowing
Feel like hearts are knowing
That this moment's ever growing
Just keep dancing, keep on showing
Spin around, let your hair down
Lift your feet off the ground
Find your spirit's joyful sound
In this beat we're all around
When your wallet's feeling gray
Dancing shoes will lead the way
In the night and in the day
Feel the music go and play
Music, my heart's in flight
Underneath the disco light
Twisted and turned through the night
Feel the joy, feel the might
Dancing shoes, dancing shoes
Lose the words, so lose
Step by step, no excuse
Let the music be your muse
Everyone around is glowing
Feel the light, hearts are knowing
That this moment's ever growing
Just keep dancing, keep on showing
Spin around, let your head down
Lift your feet off the ground
Find your spirit's joyful sound
In this beat we're all unbound
When the world is feeling great
Dancing shoes will lead the way
In the night and in the day
Feel the music go away
