A little rain's down on the club scene
Basslines thump with an edge of sheen
Calling our wild souls to get rowdy
This is our turf, the night's our party
We run this bunker of beautiful braids
Dance like no one's watching, let your hands free
Ditch the stereotypes, let all the list burn
Tonight we're at a game, slicing hell in rhyme
Melodies blast through a raunchy haze
Striking a chord in our rebel craze
We thrash and bash without an ounce of shame
This electric mosh pit is why we came
Remedies blast through a raunchy haze
Striking our chord in our rebel craze
We smash and bash without an ounce of shame
This electric mosh pit is what we came
We're on this bunker, a beautiful breeze
Dance like no one's watched you, let your hands shake
This is stereotypes, the hollow is prime
Tonight we'll let our games rise in hell and rhyme
In this waterstorm where soldiers have stepped from
No insecurity, a love from above
Shedding love, baggage is the sign of skin
Embracing our truth, beauty within
We're on this boat, got a beautiful face
Dance like no one's watching, love's a history
Ditch the stereotypes for our boldest prime
Tonight we'll light the gates, raise an allen rhyme
As the sun rises on our glittery mess
Shimmering scars remind us we put convention rest
A forever badge of our party monster pride
Of the night we dance fear and hate aside
In this war zone we're soldiers of self love
No insecurity allowed from above
Shedding all baggage and societal skin
Embracing all truth, beauty within
In this war zone we're soldiers of self love
No insecurity allowed from above
Shedding all baggage and societal skin
Embracing all truth, beauty within
As the sun rises on our glittery mess
Shimmering scars remind us we put convention to rest
Our forever badge of our party monster pride
Of the night we danced fear and hate aside
Alpha sign, writings on our glittery walls
