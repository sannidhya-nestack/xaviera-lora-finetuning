Darling if I fade away
Let the stone sink in the water
Let your hair down once it's grey
Ours were times we cannot measure
If I'm gone by break of day
Don't veil your face for ever after
Hide and seek and yet be chased
And show skin in the warmth of summer
As one slender pointing finger
With a sharpened nail
Sever our fold in front of me
Two sunkissed lips part slowly as they graze the ground and I sink
As I walk by mine tonight
My feet don't crack the skin of snow
Above two hands tear up the sky
Their fingers grew the tails of my coat
Should those hand find riders and rain
And tie this deed beside my doorstep
When they call I'll walk away
The shivery path out of my den
As one slender pointing finger with a sharpened nail
Sever a fold in front of me
Two sun-kissed lips part slowly as they grace the ground
And I sink, I sink
One slender pointing finger with a sharpened nail
Severed fold in front of me
Two sunken slips part slowly as they grace the ground
And I sink
I sink
