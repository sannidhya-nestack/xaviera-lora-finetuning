When I'm trying to get back home, I can't make it on my own
Still I try all the same, but trying starts the game
And the greatest trick of all is when it makes me take the fall
And I begin to break when it's all that I can take
And I hate the way that I can't explain
Why everything I said just seems to run away
And I can't explain why everything is red
I wish I could but I can't explain
Why everything I touch just seems to fall apart
And I can't explain why everything is red
No, I can't explain
I know there must be more to gain
Still I try to make the change
And I begin to hide
From the feelings that's inside
So how long will I last
As the face behind the mask
And I begin to shake
When it's all that I can take
And I hate the way that I can't explain why everything I said just seems to run away
And I can't explain why everything is red
I wish I could but I can't explain why everything I touch just seems to fall apart
And I can't explain why everything is red
No, I can't explain
No, I can't explain
And I can't explain why everything I said just seems to run away
And I can't explain why everything is red
I wish I could but I can't explain why everything I touch just seems to fall apart
And I can't explain why everything is red
I hate the way that I can't explain why everything I said just seems to run away
And I can't explain why everything is red
I wish I could but I can't explain why everything I touch just seems to fall apart
And I can't explain why everything is red
No, I can't explain
No, I can't explain
