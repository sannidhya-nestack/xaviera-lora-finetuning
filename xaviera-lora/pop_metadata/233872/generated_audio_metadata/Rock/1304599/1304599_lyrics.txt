When I saw you standing on the corner
My heart skipped a beat, I can't stand it no longer
But when you turned your head in my direction
My knees started swaying, my body started shaking
You moved too fast for me
You moved too fast for me
You made a move towards me, oh no
I had to think this through some quicker
It really should be realistic
And when we kissed my lips were burning hot
I knew then and there you were the one I want
You moved too fast for me
Get up real fast for me
Ready to kiss my lips with burning hot
I knew that in there you were the one I want
You're the one I want, the one for me
Slow down honey, you move too fast for me
You move too fast for me
I slow down honey
You move too fast for me, you move
You move too fast for me, you move
And you groove, you move too fast for me
I like the way you move
You move too fast for me, oh
You move too fast for me
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
