There's something in the water
But I don't give a damn
I swam among the monsters
To get to where I am
I put my faith above me
Locked out of my head
I floated on the Red Sea
Filled with blood I bled
You say I'm fake
You don't trust me
I'm such a mistake
I'm worth nothing
I'll make the earth shake
I'm a fighter
I'm an earthquake
A survivor, a survivor
Although it sounds strange
I won't change
Your words are the same
But I won't change
No, I won't change
You say I'm fake
You don't trust me
I'm such a mistake
I want nothing
I'll make the earth shake
I'm a fighter
I'm an earthquake
A survivor
A survivor
A survivor
A survivor
There's something in the water
But I don't give a damn
I swim amongst the monsters
To get to where I am
I'm survivor
I'm survivor
