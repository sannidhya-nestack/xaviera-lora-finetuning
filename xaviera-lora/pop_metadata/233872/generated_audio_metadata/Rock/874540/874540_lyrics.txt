Ooh, I don't need a man staring at TV
I don't need a man stepping out on me
I don't need a man bringing home the check
Here's my fame, don't need a ring, this is what I expect (Attention)
To my every little need (Attention)
Then you might get some from me
Ooh, I don't need a man messing up my game
I don't need a man, why do they complain?
I don't need a man that's hitting on my ass
Hands off my girl, you blew it, you know
you move too damn fast (Attention)
And respect for who I am (Attention)
That's what I need from my man (Attention)
To my every little need (Attention)
Then you might get some from me
(Tension) No, I don't need a man (Tension) No, I don't need man (Tension) I don't want a man (Tension)
No, I don't need a man (Tension)
Put your attention to me, baby (Tension)
I'm right here in front of you (Tension)
