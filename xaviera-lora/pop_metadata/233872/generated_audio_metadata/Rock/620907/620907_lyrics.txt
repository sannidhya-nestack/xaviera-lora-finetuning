You know this winter's cold'cause you can see your own breath
And it's haunting, makes the hair stand up on your neck
Like you're walking with a ghost down a dark and lonely road
For the first time, we'll send a shiver straight down your spine
And with each step, the fog is growing thicker, covering
The path you lead
And all the space between
So far away
I can't see
What's in front of me, where I've been left
Five feet ahead, with five steps to take
So close to home, so far away
I fear the break of night cause the sun just seems to die too quickly
The shadows scatter from the city
Like they're running from the sight of the flickering street light
Covering me, just covering
The path you lead and all the space between
So far away I can't see
What's in front of me or where I'd rather fly free to hate
With all you set to take
So close to home but so far alone
It's not good enough, never thought you could save me
First down in the street and now you think you changed me
Been running away for so long, you complaining
For everything that got in the way
So far away, I can't see
What's in front of me, or where I've been led
Five feet ahead, before you set to take
So close to home, so far
Five feet ahead, before you set to take
So close to home but so far away
