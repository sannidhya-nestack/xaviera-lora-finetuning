Every single day
We open up our eyes to see
Every single way
We've achieved our goals
Nobody knows how you got where you are
Everybody knows where you're going
There comes a point in life
You accept yourself
And don't look now
You're almost there
There comes a point in life
When you can let go
Open up your eyes
Now feel it in the way that you move
You know you've arrived
You've finally made your move
Every single day
We open up our mind to see
How to find a way
To express our soul
It doesn't matter where you were
Only matters where you are going
Comes a point in life
You accept yourself
And don't look now
You're almost there
There comes a point in life
When you can let go
Open up your eyes
Now feel it in the way that you move
You know you've arrived
You've finally made your move
Open up your eyes
Now feel it in the way that you move
You know you've arrived
You've finally made your move
Open up our minds
Open up our minds
Open up our minds
Open up our minds
Open up your eyes
Now feel it in the way that you move
You know you've arrived
You finally made your move
Open up your eyes
Now feel it in the way that you move
You know you've arrived
You finally made your move, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, oh yeah
