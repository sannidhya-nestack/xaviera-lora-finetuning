As I transform
A sequence of events unravel
I disconnect affinity
Delusion is resented now
Inciting my release
Waking up I turn away from you
Heed their minds as each mentality wrinkles
And you can fall
Incarcerated by life's addiction
Compliant to the end
Not understanding why
Waking up I turn away from your hidden mind
As each mentality recalls to sympathize
Fields of greed
Sense no hope, fragility
It's addiction to a worthless self
Transform
Be bound to no one
Waking up I turn away from your
Hidden mind
As each mentality recalls
To sympathise
