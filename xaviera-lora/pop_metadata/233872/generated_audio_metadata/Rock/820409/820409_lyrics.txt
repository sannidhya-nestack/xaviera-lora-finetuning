She was waiting alone in her living room
Asleep on the couch about a quarter to two
Keys in the door, hot shoes on the floor
Slow footsteps, nicotine on warm breath
How was your day baby, why didn't you call
I know you wait when I wait up but it was nothing at all
Been missing you, you know we never talk
I've been busy too
It ain't like that at all
Oh, I don't know
What you're going through
What you're racing to
Your grip's too tight
You push me aside
And make a race out of a ride
Now these fears once questioned are coming true
I do something wrong, did I get boring to you?
What is this thing you're chasing, you're racing for?
You're enough for me, but you want something more
I don't know what you're going through, what you're racing to
Your grip's too tight, you push me aside
You make a race out of a ride
Wide awake in the night
I watch you sleeping so hard
Burning through days to chase a dream
So far off in the distance
So much resistance
And all I want is you
And I'll never change
Tell me what to do
So that you feel the same
Oh, I don't know
What you're going through
What you're racing to
Your grip's too tight
You push me aside
Make a race out of a ride
No, your grip's too tight
You push me aside
You make a race out of a ride
