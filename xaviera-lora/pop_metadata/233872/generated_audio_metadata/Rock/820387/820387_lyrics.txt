I want a boy who knows what he likes
I want a boy who likes what he knows
I want a boy who loves his mom
And ain't afraid to watch a rom-com
Someone who won't treat me like a toy
I want a boy
I want a boy
I want a boy
I want a boy who's strong and kind
And won't get threatened when I speak my mind
Someone who's only got eyes for me
And ain't afraid to set me free
Someone who'll make me jump for joy
I want a boy
I want a boy
I want a boy
I want a boy
I want a boy who will lift me up
Someone who'll drink from the loving cup
I want a boy who's down to earth
Someone who'll show me what I'm worth
And it better be a lot
Don't want someone always serious
I want someone who wants to have fun
I want a boy who can make me laugh
Someone to call me his better half
Someone who'll make me jump for joy
I want a boy
I want a boy
I want a boy
I want a boy who'll lift me up
Someone who'll drink from the loving cup
I want a boy who's down to earth
Someone who'll show me what I'm worth
And it better be a lot
Don't want someone always serious
I want someone who wants to have fun
I want a boy who can make me laugh
Someone to call me his better half
Someone who'll make me jump for joy
I want a boy
I want a boy
I want a boy
I want a boy
I want a boy
