Through the blues of early morning
He goes to work, he starts his day
He's the man, he's the big man
You don't get in his way
Down, down, down, down, down
They all come tumblin' down
Down, down, down, down, down
They all fall down to the ground
Down, down, down, down, down
First the shot and then the sound
Down, down, down, down, down
They all come tumblin' down
Movers and the shakers shakin' big time
Lucky makes his call
Got connections on the fine line
He'll make you run, he'll make you crawl
Down, down, down, down, down
They all come tumbling down
Down, down, down, down, down
They all fall down to the ground
Down, down, down, down, down
First shot and then the sound
Down, down, down, down, down
They all just tumble down
I think she's got him
I think she's got him
Shotgun silenced him and now
The ambulance made its call
Twenty bullets in the heart now
Now she's the biggest of them all
Down, down, down, down, down
They all come tumblin' down
Down, down, down, down, down
They all fall down to the ground
Down, down, down, down, down
First the shots and then the sound
Down, down, down, down, down
They all come tumblin' down
Down, down, down, down, down
They all come tumblin'
Down, down, down, down, down
Bring your phone down to the ground
Down, down, down, down, down
First the shot and then the sound
Down, down, down, down, down
Just a-just a-just tumble down
Down, down, down, down, down
Just tumble down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down (Oh, I put my sharp hand in the sound)
Down, down, down, down, down (Down, down, down, down)
