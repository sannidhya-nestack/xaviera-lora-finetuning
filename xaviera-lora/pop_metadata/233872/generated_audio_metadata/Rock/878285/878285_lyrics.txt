Stop a moment, who you be? Who is you and who is me?
My life it seems has been erased
My future self has been replaced by a homeless man out on the street
No shirt, no shoes, no food to eat
How did I get here to this place? Have you seen my face?
Mountains flowing, rivers glowing
Where we've been and how we're doing
I can sense some aggravation
So I conjure up an explanation
Meaningless though it may seem
I think I saw it in a dream
Brothers helping brothers out
Can you help me out?
I don't wanna be like you (I don't wanna be like you)
And I don't wanna live like you (you live)
I don't wanna live (I don't wanna live)
I don't wanna drown in your rain (I don't wanna drown in your rain)
And I don't wanna feel your pain
If I could open my eyes and see the world that you know
I would try to imagine what you're going through
Maybe build you a house, do everything that I can
To be the Messiah for the hungry man
People live and people die
I wonder how, I wonder why
this is not your destination
Resulting from this occupation
Slipping on the power flow
What the hell do you know
About my sins or where I've been?
Can you comprehend?
I don't wanna be like you (I don't wanna be like you)
And I don't wanna live like you (I don't wanna live like you, live like you)
I don't wanna drown in your rain (your rain, your rain)
And I don't wanna feel your pain (I don't wanna feel your pain)
If I could open my eyes and see the world that you know (If I could open my eyes)
I would try to imagine what you're going through
Maybe spare you some change to everything that I can
To be your Messiah for the desperate man
But I cover my eyes (I see the light)
But I cover my eyes (I see the light, I see the light)
But I cover my eyes (I see the light), but I cover my eyes (I see the light)
If I could open my eyes and see the world that you know
I would try to imagine what you're going through
Maybe build you a house, do everything that I can
To be a Messiah for the whole good day
If I could open my eyes and see the world that you know
I would try to imagine what you're going through
Leave in space some change, do everything that I can
To be the Messiah for the desperate man
The hungry man, homeless man, be a better man
