Think until you find your place
And call this bandit is this outer space
But it's nice to know that you could be the one, the fate of me
And this blue art feel you guided me
Tonight's the night I'd sing to you
Tonight's the night I'd fall for you
Tonight's the night I'd sing to you
Tonight's the night I'd fall for you
Shame, but do you find your way?
Love is beginning this broken home
But it's nice to know that you could be the one, the best for me
In this blue I feel you guiding me
Tonight's the night I take to you
Tonight's the night I fall for you
Tonight's the night I take to you
Tonight's the night I fall for you
Tonight's the night I take to you
Tonight's the night I fall for you
Tonight's the night I take to you
Tonight's the night I fall for you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
