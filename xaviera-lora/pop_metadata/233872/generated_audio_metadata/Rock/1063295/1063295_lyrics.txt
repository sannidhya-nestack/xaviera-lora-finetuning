We were young, we were wild and free
And loving you meant the world to me
Feeling lost now that you're not here
I just don't know what I'm gonna do
See there's no getting over you
You and I, we were meant to be
And it would always be forever
Just you and me
So baby don't let go
Now or never
It's all we know
Stay together
We're so far gone
Do you remember?
So don't let go
No not ever
Cause I'm not getting over
Never getting over you
I'm not over you
I miss you here lying next to me
But all I've got is a broken dream
I'd miss your smile even when you're near
So now I'm calling to let you know
I hear that love never lets you go
I feel your soul deep inside of me
And we could always be together
Just you and me
So baby don't let go
Now or never
It's all we know
Still together
We're so far gone
Only you remember
So don't let go
No not ever
Cause I'm not getting over
Never getting over you
Don't let go
Don't let go
Don't let go
It could always be forever
You and me
So baby don't let go, it's now or never
It's all we know, stay together
We're so far gone, do you remember
So don't let go, no not ever baby don't
Don't let go,'cause now or never, it's all we know, stay together, we're so far gone, do you remember? Don't let go, so don't let go, don't let go
