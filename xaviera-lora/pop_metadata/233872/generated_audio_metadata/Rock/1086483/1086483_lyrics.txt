Take a tip from me baby
Don't pass that bottle over here
Take advice from me honey
Don't pass that bottle over here
Or I'll be long gone and crazy
Before the sun can disappear
I've been playing with the voodoo
Since you were on your daddy's knee
Sliding with the voodoo
Since you were on your daddy's knee
So if I get to heaven girl
You know I'll have to wait and see
Feel a rise in the levee
You know I heard those sirens wail
Been a rise in the levee girl
I swear I heard those sirens wail
Waiting for my Creole angel
To release me from the jail
Take a tip from me baby
Don't pass that bottle over here
Take a verse from me honey
Don't pass that bottle over here
Or I'll be long gone and crazy
Before the sun can disappear
Or I'll be long gone and crazy
