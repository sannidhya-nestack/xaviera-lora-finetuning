Didn't you see me diving the river, the same young little boy
He had gone, eating over his head, chasing a rubber toy
I jumped in with my clothing on, oh, while the river roared
What about my, what about my, what about, what about my reward
As I was walking on down the road heading for the corner bar
I saw a little girl step into the path of a rapidly moving car
I shouted and I grabbed her just in time, save her from the speeding Ford
What about mine, what about mine, what about, what about my reward? (sing it)
What about mine, what about mine, what about, what about my reward?
Give it up now, give it up now
Give it up now
Give it up now
What about my reward?
Yeah
What about my reward? What about my reward? What about my reward?
What about my reward?
Sirens screaming, people too, flames rolling up to the clouds
An old man looked from his fiery window, far up from the crowd
Lousy joke, I turned away and prayed for the soul of the Lord
What about mine, what about mine, what about, what about my reward?
What about mine, what about mine, what about, what about my reward? (Say)
What about mine, what about mine, what about, what about my reward? (Reward)
