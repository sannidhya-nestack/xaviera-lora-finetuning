With a smile on my face, I quit my band
Move it on over to that God-forsaken land
Gallon of gasoline, matches in hand
Me and my baby making love in the burning sand
Heading out east
Heading out east
Heading out east
Headin' out east
Steel us a Cadillac, candy apple red
White leather seats in the back, gonna be a bin
Drivin' through the twilight with Vegas in her sights
Gotta find a chapel called the Endless Night
She's in black, I'm in blue
Stand before Elvis and say adieu
I ask the king, can I borrow your gun?
There's a TV in my mind I can't turn off
Headin' out east, we're headin' out east
We're heading out east
Heading out east
Baby's looking good with the long blonde hair
Blowing in the wind like a drunk man's prayers
I can see the sky reflecting in her eyes
Who needs the truth when I can live for her lies
Coming up quick on the Texas state line
Thirty out six in a cell bar thirty nine
Eastern star tattooed on our mind
No need to see the road when you drinking moonshine
Heading out east
Heading out east
Heading out east
Headin' out east
We hit New Orleans with them heavy rains
People walking round in them rusted chains
Kinda broke her heart what she could see
Got on her knees set the people free
Well, the governor, he didn't like that nun
He grabbed her arm, baby, grabbed her gun
Put the barrel right between his eyes
She blew him a kiss as I wave bye-bye
Headin' out east, headin' out east
Headed out east
Headed out east
We're headed out east
Oh, we're howling like a wolf
Trying to get free
Driving through the night to Memphis, Tennessee
Whistling past the graveyard, spoonful of gold
This kind of love, never ever growing old
Sweating underneath the magnolia trees
Ocean of stars, dark as the seas
Wild wind, crying in the reeds
We're making love like a wound makes you bleed
Headin' out east
Headin' out east
Headin' out east
Headin' out east
Her eyes are red, her skin is raw
This kinda love always has claws
The sun is rising I can clearly see
New York City on the horizon of destiny
Pullin' into Hell's Kitchen real slow
Lookin' for a place where we can lay low
Skeleton thin, crazy as a loon
Can't find us no, baking room
Baby's put it all, up
To the moon
Saying love we got here much too soon
That a gypsy heart don't ever rest
And a soul is only free when it's put to the test
We're heading out west
Heading out west
Heading out west
Head in our ways
