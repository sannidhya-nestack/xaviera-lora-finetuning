Well, I got a girl on my mind
She won't spend me none of her precious time
She's cruel as an angel when they ignore your prayers
This aching heart of mine has got me feeling so low down
Feeling so low down
Feeling so low down
Feeling so low down
See the sun a-rising, ten thousand shades of blue
Tell it to go back down, the moon do what it's got to do
I need the nighttime, shine it on this broken heart of mine
And God I am feeling so low down
Feeling so low down
Feeling so low down
Feeling so low down
Feeling so low down
Feeling so low down
Feeling so low down
Well, I've been praying both night and day
For a real honest change to come my way
But I don't think the Lord, I don't think He cares
Shit, I wouldn't give a damn if I lived up there
Feelin' solo down (feelin' solo down)
Feelin' solo down (feelin' solo down)
Feelin' solo down (feelin' solo down)
Feelin', feelin', feelin' solo down
