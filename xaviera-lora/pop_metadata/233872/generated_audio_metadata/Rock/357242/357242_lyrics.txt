We low-weeping by that waterside, waterside
We low-weeping by that waterside
Time has come to say goodbye
Church bells ring by that waterside, waterside
Man comes down to the waterside, to the waterside
Hangs his head, starts to cry
Time has come to say goodbye
Church bells ring by that water side
By that water side
Oh the red clay banks by the waterside
By the waterside
Red clay banks so deep and wide
Kiss my angel she flies by
Red clay banks by the waterside
By the waterside
Oh now marry me by that water side
By that water side
Marry me by that water side
Time has come to say goodbye
The church bells ring by that water side
By that water side, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
