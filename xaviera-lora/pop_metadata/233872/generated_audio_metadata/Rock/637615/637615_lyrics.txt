I was in
I led with grace with head held high
A captivating charm authority
I was pure
I stood for truth when all was lost
If only for the slim minority
I was change
Dissenting views dissident sights
No room for fair no mediocrity
I was good
You'd look to me to write the world outside
And I'd delete
Back in the day, ooh, my words were strong and real
Back in the day, ooh, my trails were blazed in steel
I could see, my visionary views were sought
Progressive outlooks on society, I could feel
My gut was solid, cold as stone
A consequence of loyal piety
I could change, adapt and compromise
Evolve, laugh in the face of your anxieties
My memory's not what it used to be
But hun, it drives my ego
Back in the day
Ooh, my words were strong and real
Back in the day
Ooh, my trails were blazed in steel
Back in the day
Too late, I'll seal my own fate
Concealed denial, bring this beast back home
Cannot stay too straight
Yield my hope, faith
Defy everything I've ever known
Like a fan
I'll wake one day to find my limelight faded
Low subdued sobriety like a craze
I'll watch my withered seams and ties
Grow in distinct freedom variety like a man
The lines run deep now drawn and frail
A life soon lost unto antiquity like a state
Immortal words otten wisdoms eulogized
Encliche back in the day
Ooh, my words were strong and real
Back in the day
Ooh, my trails were blazed in steel
Back in the day
Ooh, my words were strong and real
Back in the day
Ooh, my trails were blazed in steel
Back in the day
