Ain't no way to treat a lady saying shady words
Talking blah blah blah
We don't wanna feel your hands up on us
Please believe us now
We don't like it if you blah blah blah blah blah blah

This thing we made of stone (yeah)
Cross our hearts like hell we try (yeah)

We'll never take you home (yeah)
on the floor we kill the night
We just wanna rocky overdrive
Dance'til we die
Party harder than
We won't want to rock'til we die without being made of stone (yeah)
Cross our hearts and tell how we died
It's not like the movies
We can be somebody in a sunny place called La La Land
Guess you have to prove it
Earn our hearts, don't call us honey, it's not La La Land
We don't like the way you're talking cocky
Take your party down to your La La Land
'Cause if we like to dress up naughty to mean we're horny boy
Your little la-la-lands are la-la-lands
If we want to rock'til we die this mean we made'em slow (yeah)

We just wanna rock it over dry bands'til we die
Party harder than nine lives
We will want to rock'til we die
Without being made of stone
Cross our hearts as we die
We won't give our hearts to someone new
If he's wasted just like you
we are nobody's fool
We'll make sure that if we do
You won't be misunderstood
You won't tell us, tell us, tell us what to do
But if you're Mr. Wrong who owns the right to really whine and die
Cross my heart that we might try
You're gonna like a lovely ride'cause we don't compromise
Want to rock until we die
Fuck'til we die, see what they say, yeah
Cross our hearts like hell, we tried, yeah (oh yeah)

A song to throw, we kill the night, we kill the night
Fuck'til we die, see what they say (yeah)
Cross our hearts like hell, we tried, yeah
So you'll say, girls from the past never take you home (yeah)
A song to throw, we kill the night
Oh yeah, we can dance like an old school bride
Dance till we die, party hard till we die
Nightlife in the night, we'll love you right till we die
Stopping and spoon, yeah
Cross our hearts as we die
Right till we die
