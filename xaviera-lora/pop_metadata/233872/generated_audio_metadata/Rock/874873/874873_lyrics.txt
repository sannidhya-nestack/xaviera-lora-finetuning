Oh, my hometown's at a hundred miles from anything at all
Just to fit in you had to keep your dreams and hope for something very small
So I grew up fast and just got past that last year of high school
I worked all summer at Rosie's Diner trying to figure out what to do
So I traded my last paycheck for a ride on a greyhound headed west
I had no place in mind but I had time
I'd figure out the rest
I believe that where you begin
And where you end
There's nowhere near the paradise you'll find in the journey
Oh yeah
And there's a whole wide world out there that I still don't know
But I'm learning the ins and outs as I go
I met a girl in the Golden State who was hard to overlook
And when she took me down by the bay I knew this wouldn't be by the books
So we played guitar on the beach all night singing every song we had
But when I woke up she was long gone
Left just a heart traced in the sand
Now I'm nobody's fool but she gave
Plenty to keep me guessing
School's out but I might just need her
To give me another lesson
Cause I believe that where you begin
And where you end, there nowhere near
The paradise you'll find in the journey of oh yeah
And there's a whole wide world out there that I still don't know
But I'm learning the ins and outs
As I go back to the drawing board
And come away with a little more than I had before
Where you begin and where you end
There are nowhere near the paradise you'll find in the journey
My friend you know that there's a whole wide world out there that we still don't know
So I'm learning the ins and outs as I go
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, come on now
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-Da-da
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
