Ever wonder what it's like when I see you smile
It just takes me to that place where I'd like to stay
Now I search to find the answers
In the corners of my mind
I've been wondering
Where you've been all my life
You ever wonder what it's like
When I see you smile
Oh and how it's changed me
And you're oh
That I'm waiting for
But I'm just what you see
Am I everything you wanted
Am I everything you need
Seems like years ago since we first started
Put your hand in mine and lead me on
To the great beyond
You ever wonder what it's like
Out beyond the stars?
You ever wonder what it's like
You ever wonder what it's like
I just want to stop the world
And be with you tonight (be with you tonight)
Ooh ooh ooh
And you're all that I'm waiting for
Ooh ooh ooh
But I'm just what you see
Am I everything you wanted?
Everything you wanted
Am I everything you need?
Everything, everything you need
Seems like years ago since we first started
Put your hand in mine and lead me on
To the great beyond
You ever wonder what it's like
Out beyond the stars
And you're all that I'm waiting for
But I'm just what you see
Am I everything you wanted? (What did you thought when you knew that you had me?)
Am I everything you need? (What is the lifestyle I'll dance to be happy again)
Seems like years ago since we first started (We're still together, we're walking forever)
Put your hand in mine and lead me on
To the great beyond (over and over and over and over)
To what we find beyond
Over and over and over and over and over and over and over
