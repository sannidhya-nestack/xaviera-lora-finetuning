Healing the boning on the honey, I close up a gun path
Touching the maze of time, we move against the shadows of fate and grace
Moving towards the unseen, chasing elusive dreams
Rushing the adrenaline, that's where you'll need to move, we begin
The chase of wildfire burning bright with desire
Hearts churning, passion ignites
Whispers of destiny unfold
Whispers of destiny on the night
Getting us to voice our noise, our way
To the one we can't pass, we might wanna
In this person, we seek our sentence
Lost in the lab of empathy, seeking chills to have some
Building a game of mind, in this list we play our part
In the nook of sense we play a part
In this blue silk we seek our center
Lost in the labyrinth of thoughts
Seeking truth behind signs
A flailing game that I'm in
This chase I play a part
The spaces of death we space DJ
And I let you have the night
You can take it to the sky
Or you can take it to the top of my heart
In the chase, we follow our hearts
In the chase, we follow our hearts
