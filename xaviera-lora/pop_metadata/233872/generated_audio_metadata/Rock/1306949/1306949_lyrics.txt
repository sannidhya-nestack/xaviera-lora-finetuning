Today was like any other
Got up, looked in the mirror
I need a little time to recover
Wash off last night's veneer
I put on a face that I want others to see
Posing for the social scene
And they don't know it ain't really me
Probably think that I'm living the dream
It don't really matter
Cause it's all chatter
I'm trying to figure out what I need when I shut out all the noise
Tired of feeling my heart bleed makes me feel a little schizoid
Maybe I am paranoid
I'm in a mood, I'm in a mood
Pleasing others more than myself
Might have got me into this mess
And it's hazardous to my mental health
If I had to take a world guess
It doesn't really matter
it's all chatter
I'm trying to figure out what I need when I shut out all the noise
Tired of feeling my heart bleed makes me feel a little schizoid
Maybe I am paranoid
I'm in a mood, I'm in a mood
I'm trying to figure out what I need
When I shoot out all the noise
Tired of feeling my heart bleed
Makes me feel a little schizoid
Maybe I am paranoid
I'm in a mood, I'm in a mood
Oh, I'm in a mood
