Did you ever have a wish for a girl who could inspire
A ten thousand year itch of hella hot desire
Well let me introduce you please to a girl who fits the bill
I think she took the little red pill
She's a sight to see, miss money
A smile worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She struts in her high heel shoes
Life's gotten better, she got everything to lose
Fashion's so refined
You have to get an airplane seat, what cost?
Lost a pretty belly, come and get some
Would you like a little treat?
Turning heads everywhere, trust me
There are very, very many
She's a little more than filthy rich
One tough bitch, welcome to the sweetness
All this money
You're one sexy sweet honey
Is it fame that you adore, miss money?
Now you got a little, would you like a little more?
Miss money, sweet little honey
I can see that you are vexed
Take a minute, check your mobile
Tell me if you got my text
Flexible, finessin'
I can see that you've been messin' with some things
I think you think that you've never seen before
She's got a wallet that is quite the little fatty
Generous she is, very very very catty
Buying up the love is something that she can't
Ever seem to get enough
Of a swipe of a card like to play the part
Crashing it very hard in the market for her bonus money
You're a fantasy, I think about you every day
I wonder if you'll ever be a significant other
Person to a person in your life
Maybe you're a girlfriend, maybe you're a wife
Miss money, oh she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever drummy
With a twinkle of greed in her eye
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
She's got a stockpile of sweet admirers
They're all just the assets that are fueling her desires
She trades her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment, not selling just a pocket
Her laughter rings like a cash register chime
Her love's a currency she can't seem to mine
A portfolio of hearts, oh what a portfolio
But the dividends are low
She'll never really notice money
Oh, she's maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold
They'll never freeze
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh how she'll spend to see
She's a penny pincher with a golden touch
She's a penny pincher with a golden touch
