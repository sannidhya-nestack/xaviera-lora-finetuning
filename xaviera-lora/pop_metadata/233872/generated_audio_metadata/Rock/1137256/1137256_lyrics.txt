You've been down
Following this and that
Under a frown, yeah
Wearing a wishing hat
Chasing a ride
Hopin' to cut some slack
Always denied, yeah
You never will answer back
Who could live life a diplomat
Never ask this or question that
Takin' a chance to fall and fly
It don't work like that
It don't work like that
It don't work like that
It don't work like that
It don't work like that
You gotta run
Before you can walk, V .E .C.
Chasing the one, yeah
Keeping the wolf at bay
It's my disdain
I better get in your way
you ain't changed yet
I fought in the judgement day
Who could live life a diplomat
Never ask this or question that
Taking a chance or fall and fly
It don't work like that
It don't work like that
It don't work like that
It don't work like that
It don't work like that
You'll be excused for thinking it's got to rash
But don't refuse, yeah, to sit on a wisdom mat
The truth be told
It's never that far away
A heart of gold, yeah
Can save you on any day
Who couldn't live life a diplomat
Never ask this or question that
Taking a chance to fall and fly
It don't work like that
It don't work like that
It don't work like that
It don't work like that
It don't work like that
