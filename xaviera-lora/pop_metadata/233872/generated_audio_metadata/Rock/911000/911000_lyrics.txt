She's entering the rocket
Waving to the crowd
Only hope left for mankind
Only hope left alive
Out there in the desert
The engine starts up now
The last fuel burnt for mankind
The last fuel we could find
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Planet Earth, part 2 .0
If she finds it, she'll be the hero
Reaching higher, searching low
No one knows what we're searching for
Can't go back, we can't withdraw
No turning back, we can't withdraw
Can't go back, we can't withdraw
As humans have a tragic flaw
In 1963, we must set aside substantial areas of our country (8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) (The mushroom cloud was the icon of my journey) (And we begin to make progress until then) (Ladies and gentlemen, please, please have a seat) (2, 1) (Mother Nature just left the building) (0, 0, 0)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Planet Earth, part 2 .0
If she finds it, she'll be the hero
Reaching high and searching low
No one knows what we're searching for
Can't go back, we can't withdraw
No turning back, we can't withdraw
Can't go back, we can't withdraw
As humans have a tragic flaw
