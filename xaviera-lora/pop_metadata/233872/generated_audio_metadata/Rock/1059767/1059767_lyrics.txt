You call me baby and I can hardly speak
I've only dreamt of this moment a thousand times before
You hold me dangerously close
I feel my heart explode
And I go weak at the knees as you put your hands on me
You put your hands on me (you put your hands on me)
And I can hardly breathe (and I can hardly breathe)
Your breath is warm on me (your breath is warm on me)
As you kiss my tears away
You take the clip from my hair
You like it wild and free
Oh baby, who am I to disagree?
I trace the shape of your arms
As you pick me up and lay me down
And I lose
I lose myself as you put your hands, yeah
You put your hands on me (you put your hands on me)
And I can hardly breathe (I can hardly breathe)
Your breath is warm on me (your breath is warm on me)
As you kiss my tears away
You put your hands on me (you put your hands on me)
And I can hardly breathe (I can hardly breathe)
Your breath is warm on me (your breath is warm on me)
As you kiss my tears
As you kiss my tears
As you kiss my tears away
Had you kiss my fears away (my fears away)
Had you kiss my tears away (my tears away)
You put your hands on me (you put your hands on me) and I can hardly breathe (I can hardly breathe) your breath is warm on me (warm on me) and you kiss my tears (and you kiss my tears)
