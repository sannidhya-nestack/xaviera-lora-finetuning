On days like these I'm somewhere else
I cut myself when I need help
The darkest thoughts you leave behind
Crawl in the shadows of your mind
Black and blue I'm born to bleed
Endless pain to smash your knees
A dying dream born in the night
That kicks and screams inside the light
Black and blue and bleeding
Using, losing, needing
Faithless, unbelieving
Outside the walls inside your head
The biggest lies remain unsaid
When nothingness is all that's left
There's always something more and less
A cut inside a heart that bleeds
We'll always need to never leave
A pocket full of many ways
A hazy start to lazy days
Exit, left not, leaving
Beggars, bed-be, leaving
Endless, always, dreaming
Back from the beginning
Wantin', usin', needin'
Somethin' that's worth keepin'
Born to die, be leavin'
Endless, nameless, meanin'
Silence that starts screaming
Silence that starts screaming
Silence that starts screaming
