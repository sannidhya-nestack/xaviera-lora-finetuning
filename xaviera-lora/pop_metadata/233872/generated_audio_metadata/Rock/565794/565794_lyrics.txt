I'm watching
Things that are better unseen
Out of the window
Look how the buildings rise, scratching the sky
And the people go crazy
People go crazy
But sure as the crow flies
I will still be your baby
I'm thinking
Things that are better unsaid
Though I get uptight
I'd be the first to say everything's fine, it's okay
But it's crazy, the world has gone crazy
But sure as the crow flies, I will still be your baby
Pure as the sunshine, I will be your sweet baby
All over the land we're like
Breathing the culture like gasoline
The throwaway lives we lead
Make it so hard to believe
Anything I'm thinking
You are disturbingly kind
Though I don't know why
Your past was black as hell, dark as the night
You were never a lady
When you were my lady
But sure as the crow flies
I will still be your baby
Pure as the sunshine
I will be your sweet baby
Sure as the crow flies, I will still be your baby
