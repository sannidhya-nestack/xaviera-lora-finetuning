You call my name
Now you've got my attention
But please don't claim to know my direction
A lonely dame
Out on a prowl
Looking for something
What did you find?
Maybe something
You weren't planning
You got fire in your soul, gal
You shoot eyes when you call
You got your finger in every pie now
Is it enough for you?
It's enough for me
Now who's to blame
When you feel like you're sinking
Oh what a shame
You didn't listen
You just kept drinking
You've got fire in your soul, gal
You shoot ice when you call
You've got your finger in every pore now
Is it enough for you?
It's enough for me, oh
