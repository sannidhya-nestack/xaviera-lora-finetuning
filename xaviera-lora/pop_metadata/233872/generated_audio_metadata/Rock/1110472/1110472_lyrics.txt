On a Saturday in June
On a sunny afternoon
On a lonely interstate
There's a hummingbird cafe
The place is clean and it is bright
Vinyl booths, familiar light
Yeah my friends all meet up there
Behind the hummingbird cafe
I've been coming here for years
Like a regular on the cheers
Everybody knows my name
And they're always glad I came
Extra parking in the back
That's where everybody's at
When the summer sun goes down
Behind the Hummingbird Cafe
And all the love and all the fights and all the booze and nights
Hanging out and staring at the stars
Now the food is standard fare
And the donuts aren't made there
And the music's from the 80's like it was when I walked in here
Sister Christian's grown, college aged kids
I've been all around the state
Olive Garden, steak and shake
No cuisine can quite compare
To my Hummingbird Cafe
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
(whistling)
