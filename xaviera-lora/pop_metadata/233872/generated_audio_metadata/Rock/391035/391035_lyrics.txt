Some days I think I'm gonna make it
Some days I know that I'll arrive
It might just take a little longer
How will I manage to be rid of all this trouble?
Another day, another week, another year
Another song, another date, another riddle
Will it ever be over? Will it ever be revealed?
The keys to my lot
The answers to my query
Whatever it may be that holds me captive here
A growing expectation
That there must be something better
That there must be something better
Something big draws near
Someday it seems like forever and a day
Someday it's getting closer than you think
Someday we'll look back on this all
A lifetime flying by in the blink of an eye
I still get breathless when the future overtakes me
Or is it I that overtakes my fate?
The chase is on, I feel my muse around the corner
Yeah, it's right around the corner from this motel, ay
Sunday seems like forever and a day
Sunday is coming sooner than you think
Sunday we'll look back on this all
A lifetime flying by in the blink of an eye
Some days I think we're gonna make it
Some days I know that I'll arrive
It might just take a little longer
Take a little longer but I'll love the ride
Some day seems like forever and a day
Some day it's getting closer than you think
Some day we'll look back on this all
A lifetime flying by in the blink of an eye
Someday seems like forever and a day
Someday is coming sooner than you think
Someday we'll look back on this all
A lifetime flying by in the blink of an eye
Someday it seems like forever in a day
Someday it's coming sooner than you think
Someday we'll look back on this song
A lifetime flying by in the blink of an eye
