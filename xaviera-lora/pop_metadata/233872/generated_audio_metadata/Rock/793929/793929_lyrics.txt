Hey, hey, I'll take you'round the Milky Way
Hey, hey, darling don't you wanna play
With your ever loving woman who loves you everyday
I've heard the buzz going round the town
The word on the street is running around
Yeah the whispering wind tells you how you've been untrue
But I will not believe it
Not till I hear it from you
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll take you'round the Milky Way
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Darling, don't you wanna play?
With your ever-loving woman who loves you every day
You might be enthralled with some girl you just saw
And honey she's just bad luck of the draw
A cold hard truth ain't about to thaw
Possessions lined tense are the law
And baby you're mine hey hey
Hey, hey, take you'round the Milky Way
Hey, hey, darling don't you wanna play
With your ever-loving woman who loves you every day
Hey, hey (hey, hey)
I'll take you'round the Milky Way
Hey, hey (hey, hey)
Darling, don't you wanna play
With your ever-loving woman
Who loves you every day
