Underground where the foxes roam
We'll find a place we call our home
Oh, amongst mossy rocks and towering pines
Where the earth and sky aligns
When the mist begins to disperse
Revealing the paths we traverse
Through the undergrowth, vast and wide
In these woods we confide
Echoes of the forest calling clear
In the quiet we reappear
Through the branches, through the shade
In this haven dancing figures parade
By the stream where the waters flow
We share secrets only we know
Ancient roots and hidden trails
Following the nightingale's tales
And when the sounds start to blend
We discover without end
Though the woods are grand and tall
In the space we find it all
Echoes of the forest calling clear
In the quiet we reappear
Through the branches, through the shade
In this haven, dancing figures parade
Through the silence we ascend
With each note we comprehend
In the end we touch the sky
In this place we fly high
Echoes of the forest calling clear
In the quiet we reappear
Through the branches, through the shade
In this haven, dancing figures parade
Yonder glen, where foxes roam
We'll find a place we call our own
Echoes linger, ever bright
In this journey we ignite
