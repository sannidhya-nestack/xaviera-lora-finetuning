Remember the times when kings had no names
Figures were shadows down Jericho lanes
You were a child in cold winter rooms
Did you dream of the day when your baby would sing
chasms of anger and light years of spring
Where is my boy and where's his love so true
These are the days I'll wait here for you
These are the days for you
And these are the days for you
And now you're sailing where songs sail when not being sung
Where crows through the high wires are notes on the staff
Where daylight dreams and where you laugh
These are the days I'll wait here for you
These are the days for you
These are the days I'll wait here for you
These are the days for you
Now you're sailing ships over darkened seas
We stack your chips and you're on your knees
But there's no turning back, there's no turning back, no
These are the days I'll wait here for you
These are the days for you
And these are the days I'll wait here for you
These are the days for you
So come on and save me from this loneliness
Come on and save me
From this heartlessness
