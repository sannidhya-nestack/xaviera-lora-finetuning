Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo
You got no money, you got no credit card
You're such a beauty, I know you work it hard
You're really something, but you talk too much
I can't believe it but I see it
That you're really gonna rock my world the way you do
You've got it anyway you want it
Turn it on my head the way you rock it
And it seems so real
The way you make me feel
It's so strong
You've got it going on
You've got it going on
You got my number, you played it all before
See what you're doing, so won't you do some more
You really got me, I'm feeling better now
Hey wait a minute, gotta live it
Cause you're really gonna rock my world the way you do
You've got it, any way you want it
Turning on my head, the way you rock it
And it seems so real
The way you make me feel
It's so strong
You got it going on
You got it going on
You think you're hip, got the lip, gotta give in
You got the walk, got the talk, got it all going on
On and on and on (so come on, come on)
You've got it, any way you want it
Turning on my head, the way you rock it
And it seems so real
The way you make me feel
You've got it, any way you want it
Turning on my head, the way you rock it
And it seems so real (And it seems so real)
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
You got it, anywhere you want it
You got it on my head, anywhere you lock it
And it's all so real
You got it going on
You got it going on
