You made me love you
I didn't want to do it
I didn't want to do it
You made me want you
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it
You made me happy sometimes
You made me glad
But there were times, dear
You made me feel so bad
You made me sigh for
I didn't want to tell you
I didn't want to tell you
I want some love.
That's true, yes I do, indeed I do, you know I do
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme what I cry for
You know you've got a brand of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me
Love you
I want some love
That's true, yes I do, indeed I do, you know I do
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme what I cry for
You know you've got a brand of kisses that I'd die for
You know you make me love you, love you
Love you
