I want to see you again, I want to see you again, I want to see you again, I want to see you again,
State of restless discontent
Dwelling on what might have been
Torturing yourself you can't let go
Kill still your inner peace
You're your own worst enemy
Not equipped to handle this alone
Honey, you can't change your life
What was is gone, now I know they don't
Turn the tables upside down, et their past
Do what made you feel alive
Just take a chance, nothing holds you back
Just take a chance
Exactly what I'm looking for
Fill the gaps, complete my world
Bitter recollections fading fast
Try to get it back again
With impulsive common sense
Overcome the fruits of circumstance
Only you can change your life
What once is born now into the dawn
Turn the tables upside down
et the past
Do what makes you feel alive
Just take a chance nothing holds you back
Just take a chance
Penetrate the densest fog
Frozen tears begin to flow
Recognize the stranger in the mirror
Spitting image, no mistake
Still a chance you can be saved
Find the strength to live, confort your fears
Only you can change your life
What was is gone now I know they don't
Turn the tables upside down
et their past
Though it makes you feel a lot
Just take a chance nothing holds you back
Yeah, just take a chance
Only you can change your life
Turn the tables upside down, et the past
Do what makes you feel alive
Hey, hey, just take a chance
