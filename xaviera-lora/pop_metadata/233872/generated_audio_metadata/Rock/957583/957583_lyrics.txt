I saw that heart shaped tattoo
There you were at cafe de flow
Just behind the linen breakfast menu
Looked once more
Gone like my Cabernet (Cabernet, Cabernet, Cabernet)
You vanished
Am I hallucinating?
The touch by voodoo
At first I thought I saw you
But you're a bird that flew so far
No one else can touch my heart that way
So lovely, a symphony, a luminosity
When I close my eyes, I still can see you
Intensely, you're haunting me
Will someone set me free
when I close my eyes, I still can see you
I took a wander through
The streets that we once danced our way down
Caught a glimpse of your bewitching lips
Ooh, I can't do
You were nowhere to be found
You got me so enchanted
Playing the fool, well
Wish I hadn't taken you for granted
You withdrew, leaving me under your spell
Ever since our first tender kiss under the silvery moon (silvery, silvery moon)
I've waited a thousand years for you
So lovely, a symphony, a luminosity
When I close my eyes, I still can see you
Intensely, you're haunting me
Oh, won't you set me free?
When I close my eyes, I still can see you
Oh, when I close my eyes, I still can see you
So lovely, so lovely
I can still see you when I close my eyes
So lovely, a symphony of luminosity, yeah
So lovely, a symphony
I still can see you, still can see you
So love me, a symphony, a luminosity, yeah
So love me, a symphony, I still can't see you, still can't see you intensely
You're haunting me, oh won't you set me free
When I close my eyes I can still see you
Wish you only knew
I'd wait a thousand years for you
A thousand years for you
I flew the whole night through
Empty house and wished for once more
Till I saw a hand with a heart shaped tattoo
Knockin' on my front door
