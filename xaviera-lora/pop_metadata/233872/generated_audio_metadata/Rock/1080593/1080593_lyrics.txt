I can hear you calling
Your voice rings softly in the air
A silent warning
A silence we both hear
There's no reason for deceiving
No reasons why we leave
I'm the one who told you
I told you I'd believe in you
One more chance for us
Give it just one more chance for us
One more chance for us
Give it just one more chance
I don't want to lose you
I don't want to make you feel this way
I tried to use you
And that was my mistake
I won't try and fool you
Won't you try
To understand that I
Reach out for you
So won't you take my hand
Won't you say you'll give it one more chance for us
Give it just one more chance for us
One more chance for us
Give it just one more chance
Is all I wanna hear you say
One more chance
Oh, give me just one more chance for us
All we need is just one more chance for us
Just one more chance for us
Give it just one more chance
One more chance
