Hold me now, Ellie, I got nowhere to hide
Hold me now, Ellie, I know how to change my mind
You bring the sunshine, I'll bring the shade
You bring the summer, I'll bring the lemonade
Honey, only you'll live when I live alone
Come with me baby, come with me baby and we can live alone
Stuck with each other, stuck with each other
Love, I wanna take you home with me, Ellie
All the boys in the blue suits callin' your name
They don't give a damn about love, to them it's just a game
Late at night when you're layin' there alone in the dark
I'm callin' for you, Ellie, can you hear it in your heart?
In your heart, love
By the only one you'll ever love
Come with me baby, come with me baby and we can live a love
Stuck with each other, stuck with each other, lover I'm gonna take you home
Well, if you're such a million miles away, man, that's true
You're never gonna find one that loves you like I do
Well, I don't waste your time
But nothing to show could be spanning the arms of the wonderful man you go
No, no, no
Take my hand, baby, dream a little of me
Close your eyes now, tell me what you see
Is it me, love?
Not the only one you'll ever love
Oh, come with me, baby
Come with me, baby, and we can live a love
Oh, suck with each other
Suck with each other, love
I don't wanna take you home
Let me in
I'm not home, home, home
