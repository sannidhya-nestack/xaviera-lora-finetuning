Gather round, inspired Avengers
Let us mould and entertain
Tales of righteousness and the guidance of salvation
Fables of the beasts we've slain
For the foes we've devastated
For the families left for dead
For the hypocrites and their wide-eyed aberrations
And the virtuous days ahead
The dust on the shades masks the blood
Though it fades there's no fading
One so beautiful now so meaningless
One's bonding dread one breeds fear
No one sees no one's winning
But believe in all I do
I'm just like you
Where the line cuts through the chaos
Where it fractures this is your loss
Transparent polar filters are split down the screen
We can highlight just how kindred we seem
The dust on the shades masks the blood
Though it fades there's no thinning
Once so beautiful
Now so meaningless
Reflections of greed
Mirrors not meditations
Misgivings
This is real
And for all you knew, she was just like you
