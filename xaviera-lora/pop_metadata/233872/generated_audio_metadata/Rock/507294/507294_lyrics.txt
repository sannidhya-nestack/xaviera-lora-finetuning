Remorse since I was born
With no attendant pain
Embattled, dusted on
Haunted and abstained
My soul is gone to hell
My pride's not far behind
I know this all too well
It's how I tell the tale
These stains I carry'round
Of Satan's certain sins
Bemused the circus found
And haunt my soul within
I've circumnavigated a dozen endless storms
But never ever reached the center of the calm
With anguish, times of night and bloody, tempest dreams
I fought to save my life
From the wind inside my screams
My screams
I dragged this weighted ball
Down streets of assassins
Knowing it contains
All my brother's sins
I'd gladly share with you
My resume of shame
And help you validate
It's me who ought be blamed
I circumnavigate a dozen endless storms
But never ever reach the center of the calm
With anguish, house and night and bloody tempest dreams
I fight to save my life
From the wind inside my screams
My screams
These feelings that I own, I fear will always be
Deep within my bones for all eternity
I serve a navigator, dozen endless storms
But never ever reach the center of the calm
With anguished hands and night and bloody tempest
Dreams I fight to save my life
From the wind inside my screams
From my screams
The wind inside my screams
The wind inside my screams
Oh, in my skin, in my skin, my skin, my skin
