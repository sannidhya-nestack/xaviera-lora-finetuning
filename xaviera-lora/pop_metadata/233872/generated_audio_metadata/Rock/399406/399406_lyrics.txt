Once upon a time now
I woke and found Letitia gone
She left no note on the table
She only left the TV on
I ran to the door but she'd nailed it shut from outside
My fingers scratched the wood and cried
I ran to the window and bellowed something out loud
Oh, Letitia, why? Why?
Tell me if I tire you
Tell me when you leave your world behind
Tell me why I admire you
The massive oak trees and the spangled sunshine
Put your way-roving lights now
Come on in and take me down
Paint all my neighbors
Go ahead and put Sinatra on
You're running rabid through this head of mine all day long
Let's put all talk of touch aside
With your promises as vacant as this job of mine
Ooh, let's just show why, why
Tell me if I tire you
Tell me when you leave your world behind
Tell me why I admire you
My suburban trees and spangled sunshine
Oh my spangled sunshine
Oh my spangled sunshine
Ah yeah la la la la
La, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la, la
La
Come on, my sound
Stand alone as I do now
Our messy colored memories fade
A gripping time inside the fable
Those steamy nights seem so far away
But every now and then I see you in the satay
Thought you were up on some pathetic guy
You know it's while it's
Fatter than the car I drive, ooh
Leticia, why, why?
Tell me if I tire you
Tell me when you leave your world behind
Tell me why I admire you
Tell me when you leave your world behind
Tell me if I tire you
Tell me when you leave your world behind
Tell me why I admire you
The massive urban trees and the spang of sunshine
