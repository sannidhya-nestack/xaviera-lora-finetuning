Just like, just like a flashlight
Try to find my way through the dark night
I know you're out there and I'm searching for you
Just like, just like a red light
Why are you feeling so uptight?
Don't you worry I can take it slow
You know I want you
You know I need you
You got all that I'm looking for

Whoa whoa yeah
Just like, just like a prize fight
Restyle, refine your delight
I love the challenge in your attitude
Cats are served as your disguise
Play pool waiting on the outside
Love you is fine and soon you're coming my way
You know I want you
You know I need you
You got all that I'm looking for
Pa pa pa pa da da, whoa oh oh yeah
Pa pa pa pa da da, whoa oh oh yeah

Just a flashlight
Try to find my way into the dark night
You know I want you
You know I need you
You got all that I'm looking for
