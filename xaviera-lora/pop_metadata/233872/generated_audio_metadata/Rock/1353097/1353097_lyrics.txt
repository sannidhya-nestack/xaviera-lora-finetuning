[Burp]
Why does my life seem a darker shade of grey?
A kingdom of sorrow, depression, misery?
Face held in my hands, won't face my demons
Suffering is stress, let me save from the
Like the way you always say, I'll never leave here
I know, I know you wanna be someone, hold me now
I'm falling down to somewhere I can never escape
The walls are just too high
One day bleeds into the next, it all just looks the same
A world of distractions, it won't be pointless game
Nothing you will change, words on your exchange
All that's left to face, take it all from me
Like the way you always say, I'll never leave here
I know, I know you wanna be someone
Hold me now, I'm falling down to somewhere
I can never escape, the walls are just too high
Why does my life seem a darker shade?
I'll take these into the next, it all just looks the same
One thing you will taste
Prisoner in chains
No man left to free
Take it all from me
Like the way you always say
I'll never
I know, I know you want to be someone to hold me
Now I'm falling down to somewhere I can never escape
The walls are just too high to make the way you always say
I'll never
I leave here, I know, I know you wanna be someone
Like the way you always say, "I'll never leave here"
