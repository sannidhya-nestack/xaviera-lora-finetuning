Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So you climbed up the ladder
You took a bad turn
And you splintered up
So you say that it's over
With no closure
And you had enough
Every center stage
Just a turning page
Fading into the back
I know it's hard to see now
But you'll make it there
It's just a stepping stone like a brick in the road
It's lifting you higher
You open up a door when the windows close
It's making things brighter
Every fall you take, making your heart break
Every dashing hope that you'll ever know
It's just a stepping stone
Yeah
Life through a thousand curved balls
You hit a stone wall and you're giving up
Keep thinking your heart has been
Every pass wind lost in the dust
So you toss and turn and you let it burn
Night after night
It seems so hard to push through
Don't let it put you down
Just a stepping stone like a brick in the road
It's lifting you higher
You open up a door when the windows close
It's making things brighter
Every fall you take making your heart break
Every dash and hope that you'll ever know
Is just a stepping stone
It's just a stepping stone
It breaks you down
Then builds you up right
But this winding road
Is gonna straighten up fine
Just keep on driving
Just a stepping stone like a brick in the road
You open up a door when the windows close
It's making things brighter
Every fall you take is making your heart break
Every dash and hope that you'll ever know
Is just a stepping stone
It's just a stepping stone like a brick in the road
It's lifting you higher
You open up the door when the windows close
It's making things brighter
Every fall you take is making your heart break
Every dash in hope that you'll ever know
It's just a stepping stone
It's just a stepping stone
It's just a stepping stone
It's just a stepping stone, yeah
It's just a stepping stone, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
