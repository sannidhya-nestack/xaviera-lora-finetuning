Well there's something going on in my woman's head
I don't know what it is or where I'll be in a minute
Suddenly I'm waking up to breakfast in bed
I think she's up to no good
She's sayin' that I work hard and it's only fair
I should live around all day and she won't even care
She lets down her hair, puts on lace and underwear
I think she's at the door good
I'm not taking any chances
I think I'm not normal in the neighborhood
There's gotta be a reason
She got programmed for pleasing
I think she's up to no good
Well, well, up the north coast
Maybe it's some jewelry she was looking at
Maybe it's a poodle, maybe a Siamese cat
Worst of all, the opera, you know I can't handle that
I think she's living longer
I would tend to think she's on her normal trip
That would be advancing our relationship well
I need to be prepared, y'all, I'm trying to get myself a grin
I think she's the known gun
I'm not taking any chances
Something not normal in a neighborhood
Well, gotta be a reason
She got programmed with reason
I think she's up to no good
Well, up to no good, no good
Well, well, I ain't taking any chances
Something's not normal in the neighborhood
Gotta be a reason she got programmed for pleasing
I think she's up to no good
Well, well, well
And I ain't taking any chances, no
Something ain't normal in my neighborhood
And there's gotta be a reason
Well she got a program of her pleasing
I think she's done to no good
And to no good to no
I ain't taking any chances y'all
Something on a normal in the neighborhood
Well there's gotta be a reason
Yeah, she got programmed for pleasing
I think she's up to no good
Up to no good, I think so
Up to no good, that woman, man
Gotta be a reason she got programmed for pleasing
I think she's up to no good
Up to, up to no good
Someone ain't normal in the neighborhood
Well there gotta be a reason
She got programmed for pleasing
I think she's up to no good
Oh that woman
