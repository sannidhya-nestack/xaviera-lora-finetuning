Everyone I meet has a story like the one I'll tell
Where I've met you, then I've lost you, then I find myself
But it's not me that I paid the fee to see in hell
And all I get is dizzy on this carousel
This is my heart, I'm gonna break
But if I could touch you one more love you one more time I'd go away
This is my heart
Look in my face girl, see the traces girl, of the tears I've cried
But these are not for you
They belong to who's bought your lines
And I'll find someone
And you'll find someone
And we'll all get by
But it's this piece of my life
I've wasted that I can't deny
This is my heart
I'm gonna pray
But if I could touch you one more, love you one more time, I'd go away
This is my heart, I'm gonna break
Here in the sensitive world
You promised, you promised, you promised
But it's this feeling of boredom that's strongest
I don't wanna play no more
I don't wanna play no more
Just wake me up when it's dead
This is my heart, that I'm gonna break
But if I could touch you one more, love you one more time, I don't wait
This is my heart, that I'm gonna break
Here in the sunset of my life
Here in the sad state of my love
