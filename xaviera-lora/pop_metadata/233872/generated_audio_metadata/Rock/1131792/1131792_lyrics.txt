I let my guard down, you got too close
I should have known, I couldn't pay the cost
I was in too deep, and I got too wet
I should have known
I wasn't ready yet
But I've gone too far
I can't stop now
I'm giving my heart and soul
I've gone too far
I can't stop now
I've given you all control
I've gone too far
I've gone too far
In over my head
With no way out
I should have known better
And I had my doubts
But I've gone too far
I can't stop now
I'm giving my heart and soul
I've gone too far, I can't stop now
I've given you all control
I've gone too far
I've gone too far
I can't stop thinking about you
No matter how hard I try
I can't stop dreaming about you
You're always on my mind
I need to catch myself
Before I take the fall
But it's too late now
I've gone too far
But I've gone too far
I can't stop now
I've given my heart and soul
I've gone too far
I can't stop now
I've given you all control
I've gone too far
I've gone too far
