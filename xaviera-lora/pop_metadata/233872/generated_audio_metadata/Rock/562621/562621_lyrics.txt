Ooh, this precious moment
While we were dancing so slow and tenderly
I can feel your heart beating right next to mine
I wish we were frozen in time
Your blue eyes tell me
You feel the power of this special night
I'd do anything to stop the world
And make this kiss last forever
Don't say goodnight
Let me hold you so gently
Just one more kiss
And we'll stay here forever in this place
My sweet angel
Why does it have to be just a memory
I'd do anything to stop the world
And make this kiss last forever
Don't say goodnight (ooh)
Let me hold you so gently (ooh)
Just one more kiss (ooh)
And we'll stay here forever in this place
Oh, it's impossible
To stay here forever but we can return
Whenever the memory of this moment
Can make this kiss last forever
Make this kiss last forever
