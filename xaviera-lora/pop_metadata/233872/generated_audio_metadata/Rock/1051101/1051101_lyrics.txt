I am turning leaves and rolling sleeves until I find you
Hide until it's gone until it leaves for when it sleeps
How did we get here knowing damn well the cards in play
It was nothing or nobody I did this to myself
I know it's gonna be, it's gonna be so
Now, internally so joyous
I know it's gonna be different somehow
I know it's gonna be different somehow
To find that we
The warrior of the fade
To fight the weary
The warrior of the fade
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, don't give it, oh don't give it
Ongongivit, Ongongivit
Can't describe them all, a slip of the tongue in an edgy room
One last nailed a hammer for the truth that's been buried down deep
In the burying place of fallen dreams I reach for hope
The road that has no end carries the troubles of us ancients
How naive to think that you could keep us still with lies
No, it's gonna be, it's gonna be so
I know it's gonna be different somehow
I know it's gonna be different somehow
To fight the weary, the warrior
To fight the weary warrior of the fade
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oonga Oonga there Oonga Oonga there
Oonga Oonga there Oonga there
I know it's gonna be different somehow
I know it's gonna be different somehow
To fight the weary, the warrior, the fade
To fight the weary, the warrior, the fade
To fight the
To fight, weary warrior of hate
