We don't have to sacrifice
We don't have to change our ways
We just keep rolling on and on
We sleep through days and days and days
We work all day and nothing gets done
We don't really care, just passing time
We'll pass the days amongst the years
We cash our checks, we lose our souls, we hide our tears
My brain is getting numb, my heart is getting weak
My body's getting old, I'm having trouble speaking
And my eyes can't make believe that they still see
I point to all of this, I'm walking away
I'm leaving no regrets, the end begins today
Because this inconsequential life, it's killing me
It's killing me
Time keeps rolling like a snowball
Faster and faster as it goes downhill
The youth you thought would never end it all
Oh how you wish you could make the time stand still
And all the dreams you have protected
You dug him way up on the shelf
Well it seems they felt neglected
And ran off
With somebody else
My brain is getting numb
My heart is getting weak
My body's getting old
I'm having trouble speaking
And my eyes can't make believe that they still see
I point to all of this, I'm walking away
I'm leaving no regrets, the end begins today
Because this inconsequential life, it's killing me
Feels like I'm lost with no direction
Feels like I'm blowing in the wind
And this is the end
My brain is getting numb, my heart is getting weak
My body's getting old, I'm having trouble speaking
And my eyes can't make believe that they still see
I point to all of this, I'm walking away
I'm leaving no regrets, the end begins today
Because this inconsequential life, it's killing me
It's killing me, yeah it's killing me
It's killing me
