Taking down my troubles to the water
When I'm drowning then I try to stay afloat
Waking to the hardship of the father
I'm surrounded by his given strength to cope
And I find that there's a river
That it flows past all my pain
I'm reminded to deliver my love in touch
The morning bird that's singing in a wire
As the sun is filtering warmly through the trees
And I feel'em burning deep in tents of fire
It burns away the heart that never sees
And I find that
There's a river that it flows past all my pain
I'm reminded to deliver my love in time
Some may fall, some stand and deliver
All hope and fear their rope will come undone
When you listen to the burden that they carry
You wonder if they ever will be one
And you find that there's a river
And it flows past all your pain
I'm reminded to deliver my love in touch
My love in touch, my love in touch
