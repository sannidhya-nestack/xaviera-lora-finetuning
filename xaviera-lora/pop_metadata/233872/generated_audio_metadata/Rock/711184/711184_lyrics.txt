Alright
You know what I want
You know what I need
And you just keep making it harder
I'm down on my knees
This thing is so hard to find
Baby can't you see
You got the power you know
So have mercy on me
Ooh ooh ooh
Turn up the fire
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Higher and higher
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm burning inside
Losing my mind for you
Yeah baby
You got me addicted
To a sweet kind of pain
That hinges my soul
Makes me want it again
I'm helpless without you
And worse when I'm with
I'm lost in a world
Where your touch is my fix
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Turn up the fire
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Higher and higher, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm burning inside, losing my mind for you, yeah
Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na, na-na, yeah
Yeah baby, ooh
Turn up the fire (ooh)
Higher and higher and higher (ooh)
I'm burning inside
Losing my mind for you
