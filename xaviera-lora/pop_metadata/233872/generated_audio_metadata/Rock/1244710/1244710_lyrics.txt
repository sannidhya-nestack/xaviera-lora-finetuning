A cancer that grows every day
Killing my cells, transcending the pain
Hope fading away
I'm sick and tired of this world
Acred sightless, healing untold
Shivered and cold
I'm not free from these chains that are restin' my soul
Until I begin to believe in
I'm not free from these chains that are restin' my soul
Until I begin to believe in me
Live without faith or a reason to be
Praying for sins, praying for fear
Too scary to hear
I can't get whatever I want
But through every madness it's so far alone
Lost and distant
I'm not free from the chains that arrested my soul
Until I began to bleed and
I'm not free from the chains that arrested my soul
Until I begin to believe and live (I'm not afraid for the things that are resting my soul)
Until I begin to believe and (I'm not afraid for the things that are resting my soul)
Until I begin to believe and live
