There's a cold wind blowing through this town tonight
I can feel it deep in my soul tonight
I walk down all the streets I knew so well
As I pass your old hotel
I still can't believe you really gone away
I tell you, we were almost living in paradise
Can't et, can't et you
Those were the best days of my life
Can't et, can't et you girl
Oh, oh, oh
I'll just stand here on the corner for a while
What I'm searching for
I know I'll never find
In my mind
He's playing tricks on me
Everywhere it's you I see
I keep holding on
Holding on to yesterday
I'll tell you
We were almost living in paradise
Can't et, can't et you
Those were the best days of my life
Can't et, can't et you girl
It's getting late, it's time to go
But I wouldn't give just a few
Your head on my shoulder
Oh no
We were almost living in paradise
Can't et, can't et you
Those were the best days of my life
Can't et, can't et you girl
Almost living in paradise (almost living in paradise)
Can't et, can't et you
Those were the best days of my life (those were the best days of my life)
Can't et, can't et you girl
