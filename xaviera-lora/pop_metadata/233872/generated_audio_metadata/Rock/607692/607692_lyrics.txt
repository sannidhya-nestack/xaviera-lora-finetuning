Oh, what's your next move?
Show us the way to the road
That we're taking on a holiday
It's all mine,'cause I've earned 40 hours
Plus it's time for the weekend and a lot
We all need something better to keep up
We never stop working
We never stop working
And we all need something better to keep up
We never stop
Oh, I keep falling asleep
To the tropical sounds on my radio alarm clock
It's taking a wake day by day
But I have
Have not finished doing nothing
Haven't finished doing nothing
We all need something better to keep up
We never stop working
We never stop working
We wish we hadn't passed our lives away
We'd never stop working
We'd never stop working
And time and time and time again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I wish I had been a firefighter
I want to be a hero
I want to be a hero
Then I woke up
I didn't see it coming
We didn't see it coming
It never stops
