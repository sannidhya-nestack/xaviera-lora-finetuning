I'm too painful
Through the valleys, through the hills
I can feel the timeless thrills
In the silence of the dawn
Memories linger never gone
Every breeze that sweeps the land
Holds the touch of your hand
In the rustle of the leaves
Our love is what it believes
Winds of change they guide us through
Every path that leads to you
In the heart of all we know
Love remains, it will grow
Ancient trees with stories old
In the shade our love unfolds
Through the seasons, through the years
We stand strong despite the fears
Every breeze that sweeps the land
Holds the touch of your hand
In the rustle of the leaves
Our love is what it believes
Winds of change they guide us through
Every path that leads to you
In the heart of all we know
Love remains it will grow
Mountains high and rivers wide
With your love I'm fortified
In the quiet, in the storm
Your embrace keeps me warm
Golden fields where we once played
Under skies that never fade
In the twilight of our time
Your love's rhythm is my rhyme
Every breeze that sweeps the land
Holds the touch of your hand
In the rustle of the leaves
Our love is what it believes
Winds of change they guide us through
Every path that leads to you
In the heart of all we know
Love remains, it will grow
As the sun sets and we part
Know you're always in my heart
Winds of change may come and go
But our love will always flow
