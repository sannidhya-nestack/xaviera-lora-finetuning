If this is what you need and the price you'll pay
Change the scene and wait for day
You prayed so hard for rain to come
She brought the shining sun
One more day on the tight wire
Who tried to run away on the tight wire
One more day
Pretty eyes so green
I think of trees
A jagged iris where fresh sap bleeds
She prayed so hard for rain to come
She brought the shining sun
One more day on the tight wire
One more day on the tight wire
We tried to run away on the tight wire
One more day
I won't leave, can't go away
Don't come back until you've changed
You prayed so hard for rain to come
You brought the shining sun
We'll face the sun
And all those things that came undone
In the face of all to come
One more day
On the tight wire
One more day
On the tight wire
One more day
