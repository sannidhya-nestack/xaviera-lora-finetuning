Soon they say, your life turned the other way
Thanks to problems you can't erase
Like thousand hearts in pain
But now it's different'cause you've saved the name
You've taken everything, you've broken all my windows
And now you're waiting for a chance to be here just with me
Silent whispers coming out beneath the back door
I'll take one more and pray to god that I'll et your face
A night washed up in disgrace
Black and blue spreading on your nails
Alone be thy name
Shining diamonds from a silver age
Awaiting mentions of your name trying to make me
Feel worse than ever and I never even did a thing
To worsen our irrational complex relation
et the feeling, take all of around in our day
You've taken everything, you've broken all my windows
And now you're waiting for a chance to be here just with me
Silent whispers coming out beneath the back doors
I'll take one more and pretty girl did I et your face
I've taken too many
But this feeling is what keeps me up at night
Heart broken so lonely
I couldn't care less give it up you're dead so long
Estas muerta para mi
Escucho mis susurros silenciosos
