Memorize books of a thousand pages
I'd wrestle wild animals in gilded cages
I'd lay me down in a snow melt stream
I'd do anything just to please Emmeline
Please Emmeline, Emmeline
Please do what I ask, I'm down on my knees
Please don't cry and please don't fly
Please don't ever leave me, Emmeline
Emmeline
Build you a sandcastle eight miles high
I'd harmonize with the birds on high
On broken glass I'd crawl and beat
I'd do anything just to please Emmeline
Please Emmeline, Emmeline
Please do what I ask, I'm down on my knees
Please don't cry, please don't fly
Please don't ever leave me
Emmeline, Emmeline
When you bring us your smile
The flags they fly
Shooting stars light up the sky with sunshine
I'd drink my fill from a poisoned whale
I'd lay down all possessions as well
I'd scale the mountains, swim the seas
I'd do anything just to please Emmeline
Please, Emmeline, Emmeline, please do what I ask, I'm down on my knees
Please don't cry and please don't fly, please don't ever leave me, Emmeline, Emmeline
When you bring us your smile
The flags they fly
Shooting stars light up the sky
With sunshine, sunshine, sunshine
Sunshine
