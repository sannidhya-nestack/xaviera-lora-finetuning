I'm gonna feel a little bit better
Get off my knees so I can et about it
Make another start
Jump on a boat that's heading downriver
I kinda hope I'm going somewhere without it
I ain't coming back
She's got ways of keeping your spirits high
But that don't make it easy to say goodbye
I realize you needed assistance
When I arrived well you were just fine without it
I can't live with that
So jump on a boat that's heading downriver
I kinda hope I'm going somewhere without it
I ain't coming back
Late September always will remind me
Of friends and lovers and all those others that bind me
Late September always will remind me
Of friends and lovers and all those others that bind me
She's got ways of keeping your spirits high
But that don't make it easy to say goodbye
She's got ways of keeping your spirits high
But that don't make it easy to say goodbye
