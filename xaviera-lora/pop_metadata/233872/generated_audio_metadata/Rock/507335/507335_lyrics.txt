Yeah, I'm talking to you
I want you back now
For what you did to me
Can't take it back now
Things you said you will regret
And watch the backside
Yellow light friends won't help you now
Meet Mr. Darkside
Just bought a one way ticket straight to hell
There ain't no restitution
Till I get a little old fashioned retribution
Bring it on, I'm moving like a freight train
Moving so fast, I'm stealing your face
You know I don't give a damn what you say
Your lame excuses are making me crazy
You pay the price now, flesh and blood I don't forsake
I'm coming back now
With a vengeance like a rattlesnake
Ain't no rest until I get a little
With your blue shirt
Bang it on, I'm moving like a freight train
Movin' so fast, I'm staring at your face, you know I
Don't give a damn what you say
Your lame excuses are driving me crazy
Ain't no restitution
Till I get some retribution
Bring it on
Like a freight train
Rollin' so fast I'll steal in your face
You know I don't give a damn what you say
Your lame excuses are drivin' me crazy
Bring it on
Like a freight train
Don't give a damn what you say
You're making me crazy
