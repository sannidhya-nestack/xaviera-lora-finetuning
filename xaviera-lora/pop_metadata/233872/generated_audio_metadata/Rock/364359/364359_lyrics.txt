On the tip of my tongue
There were three little words
Those three little words
On the tip of my tongue
Then I saw you with her
And I ot every word
Those three little words
Would never be heard
They could have been "Let's get married"
They could have been "I love you"
But you'll never know
Oh no, no, no
You went and found somebody new
On the tip of my tongue
How my eyes opened wide
Now my lips are sealed
Am I loving you, yes I
They could have been let's get married
They could have been I love you
But you'll never know
Oh no no no
You went and found somebody new
On the tip of my tongue
How my eyes opened wide
But now my lips are sealed
And my love for you has died
On the tip of my tongue
There were three little words
Those three little words
On the tip of my tongue
Three little words
On the tip of my tongue
Three little words
On the tip of my tongue
