You never stay in one place too long
You got a one to love, second to none
Always wasting time to track you down
You're a ricochet with bags and a phone
You're out of sight, at least you could write
You're all my nights, at least you could write
You got your list of hot spots never seen
You check them off one by one
Riding trains and flying machines
Just to get your business done
I see you trekking'cross desert sand
See you sliding down frozen slopes (out of sight)
I'll take it for your next flight in hand
Will I just sit and moan?
You don't do right, at least you could ride
This old world wide, at least you could ride
Oh baby when you finally get back home
I'm gonna hide your visa and passport
And that way you won't roam no more
Change in latitude and latitude
Fix times on a thing of the past
It's all giving me an attitude
I wonder how long you can last
It makes me want to die
At least you could ride
Maybe mid-flight
At least you could ride me
No time for wish you were here
But girl I hope to see you soon
At least promise when you run out of earth
You won't start exploring the moon
It might sound try
At least you could ride
Your whole mind dies
At least you could ride, babe
Yeah, drop a line, babe
So since that's fine, at least you could ride
I know my rides, at least you could ride, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ride with me
You're out of sight, at least you could ride
You're on my night, at least you could ride, yeah
