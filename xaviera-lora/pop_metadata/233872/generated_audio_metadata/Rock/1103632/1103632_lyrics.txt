Dream another life and go far away from here
I know what you said, that none of this was real
Hold onto the aftermath of what you've done before
Everyone was so in tune that you could have done more
That you could have done more
And the fallen moon aligns with the
Way you look tonight
And the fallen moon aligns with the
Radiance
Radiance
Radiance
All of my life, I wanna be like you
All of my life, I wanna be like you
Heart of man, what you gonna do?
Heart of man, what you gonna do with yourself?
I hear the voices
Call out my name
All of my life I wanna be like you
All of my life, I wanna be like you
Heart of man, what you gonna do?
Heart of man, what you gonna do with yourself?
Open all the doors and let the wind blow through the window
Thought you might be home tonight but you won't ever show
It's a pretty sky when all the love around you fades
I won't be the one to lose when all is left to gain
When all is left to gain
And the falling moon aligns with the way you look tonight
And the falling moon aligns with the radiance
Radiance, Radiance
All of my life I wanna be like you
All of my life I wanna be like you
Oh man what you gonna do
Heart of man, what you gonna do with yourself?
