What do I fear?
What am I afraid of?
Why am I so scared?
I'm gonna face the demons
Let battle begin
We'll see what they can bring
I have my inner strength
And I will beat this thing
I can win
I will prevail
I can win
I will prevail
I'll win
I'll win
We are victorious
This fear is meaningless
Make us autonomous
We are victorious
We can win, we can win, we can win
Now I know we'll win, we can win
We can win
We can win
