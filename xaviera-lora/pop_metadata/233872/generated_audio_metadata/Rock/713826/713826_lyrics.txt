Her long dress flows in the wind and rays
And her white smile lights up the beaches
We go home together when the day is late
And her vibration is far reaching
She feels like freedom in the sun
Sweet love, freedom in the sun
Energy, she's energy, whoa
She feels like freedom in the sun
Sweet love, freedom in the sun
Energy, she's energy, whoa
Blue and clear, as far as you can see
Light fills the sky and her skin is gold
Swaying and dancing across the sea
Yeah, her gravitation has taken hold
She feels like freedom in the sun
Sweet love, freedom in the sun
Energy, she's energy, whoa
She feels like freedom in the sun
Sweet love, freedom in the sun
Energy, she's energy, whoa
And I'm high on her starry eyes
As we watch the tides fall and rise
She got me in a frame of mind
As I sit and send and watch her shine
She feels like freedom in the sun
Sweet love, freedom in the sun
Energy, she's energy, whoa
Energy, she's energy
Energy, she's energy
Energy, she's energy
Energy, she's energy
