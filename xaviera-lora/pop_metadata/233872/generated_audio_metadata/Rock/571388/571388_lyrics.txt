Hey baby, stay and listen for a while
I've been besotted by your angelic smile
Before we jump into the deep end
I wanna tell you that I've been, ooh, a transition man
I lay my hat everywhere I go
And I don't keep records of my aging show
I keep them all in my mind
You know I have a hell of a time
Being a TransAsian man
There was a woman long ago
Who had my every being
She stole my heart and my soul
She was the air I breathed
But things went wrong, we had a fight
And then she disappeared, oh, from this transition man
So don't get close, don't fall in love with me
I still got her in my memory
If you want to keep me warm
Hold my hand through the storm
Comfort this transition man
There was a woman long ago who had my every beat
She stole my heart and my soul, she was the air I breathe
But things went wrong, we had a fight and then she disappeared
Oh, from this transition man
A transition man
A transition man
A transition man
That look in your eye
The way you walk
You look so much like her
Just your talking
How you feel so good, oh, transition man
