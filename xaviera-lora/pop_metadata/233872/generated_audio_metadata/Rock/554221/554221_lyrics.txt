Here's the rain
The clouds have had their say
Screaming out for more
As the rain
Leaves you all alone
It's the pain
That frightens you away
It never stops
A fear you've always known
Then
When all is lost in clouded thoughts
And darkened skies
To find the stars between we need
To realize they're everywhere
Just because a heart that found its way never was
Don't dream you're no part in the only play now for
You've a love you must share there
Where all is lost in clouded thoughts and darkened skies
The stars we share are all we have to realize
They're everywhere
Between us, they're everywhere
Between us, they're everywhere
Between us, they're everywhere
