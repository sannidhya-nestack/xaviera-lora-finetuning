Break, break, stop it for your own sake

Silent round, creepy sound
No one's around
Boy, I wish I never knew
Blowing eyes, they decry
Make you cry, boy, I wish I never saw
I cannot feel my breathing, my heart's so beating, my mind is freaking out now
You are the one who's cheating, don't try to sneak on, give me
Give me your best shot

This fight could be your last mistake
et all your tears, dump all your fears
Don't take false steps,'cause you're only
You again, play your games like insane
Baby, you can't stop
Give me a free reign
To lead my way
In the fast lane
Boy, I'll get you to the top
I can't even feel my breathing
My heart's not beating
My mind is freaking out now
You are the one who's cheating
Don't try to sneak

Me and my friend EHC, he's about to get into it. You ready?
You know it,'cause I was born ready
B-H-C, climax to the beat
G-N-B, got your ass out your seat
NYC is the place where I be, but G2G
So you might not see me, I'm gonna be a rockstar
Fuck what you think
I ain't scared of a damn thing, run like a sink
If you wanna get some, I'm the man to see
Bow down to the king, who the fuck you be?
I get money worldwide, never localize
Stop riding my dick, not circuits
I'm Silas, ask the G9, we ain't move, run this shit
Each member's mad sick, just take your pick
And I'm rollin' on the track like a fuckin' Kush crusher
My girl is fine, so you know I'm gonna touch her
When I get time, best believe I'ma fuck her
And I'ma make it big like Mother Russia
Break, break, stop it for your own sake
My conflict, this fight could be your last mistake
et all your tears, dump all your tears
Don't take false steps, come see your own light
Break, break, stop it for your own sake
My conflict, this fight could be your last mistake
et all your tears, stop all your tears
Don't ignore all the steps'cause you're only
Break, break, stop before your road is sick
You gotta break, break, stop before your road is sick
You gotta break, break, stop before your road is sick
You gotta break, break, stop before your road is sick
You gotta break, break, stop before your road is sick
You gotta
