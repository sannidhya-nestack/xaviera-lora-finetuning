Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
You left me standing at your door
Begging for you today
I feel so stupid
It kills me
No answer on my text or tweets
Yahoo or Facebook page
I feel rejected, and it kills me
How could a perfect girl like me fall so deep?
it kills me that I still want you so bad, yeah, yeah
And it kills me to know you can drive me mad
Yeah, yeah, it kills me
I lose my self-control
And the swagger I used to have
It kills me, yeah, yeah
But baby, it doesn't kill who I am
And now you're pretty slick
Perfect time, apologies
They didn't cure the pain
They killed me
So I will never let you make my brown eyes blue again
I am no masochist, I won't let it kill me
How could a perfect girl like me fall so deep?
it kills me that I still want you so bad, yeah yeah
And it kills me to know you can drive me mad
Yeah, yeah, it kills me
I lose my self control
And the swagger I used to have
It kills me, yeah, yeah
It will kill the love I have for you
As if you really give a damn
It will kill all of my dreams of you
'Cause it kills me that I still want you so bad
Yeah, yeah, and it kills me
To know you can drive me mad
Yeah, yeah, and it kills me (it kills me)
That I still want you so bad (I want you so bad, so bad)
And it kills me (what? Yeah!)
To know you can drive me mad
Yeah, yeah, and it kills me (it kills me)
And I still want you so bad (oh baby)
Yeah, yeah, and it kills me (it kills me)
To know you can't drive me mad (yeah, yeah)
Can't drive me mad (it kills me)
Yeah, those arms have no control
And the sweater I used to wear (the sweater I used to wear)
It kills me, yeah, yeah
But baby, it doesn't care who I am, yeah
