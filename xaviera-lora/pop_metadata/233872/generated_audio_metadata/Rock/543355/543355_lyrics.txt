Burn like fires in the sun
Like bullets from a barrel aimed from a gun
Names twisting in the flames
Sinking into shadows
Clocks just hanging on my wall
I could hear them say
You've no time at all
I found a feather on the ground
Beside a bow and arrow
Like pebbles in kaleidoscopes
Far off worlds in telescopes
Faces in a photograph
Tired and worn
And torn in half
Boats in anchor to the sea
Sometimes I like to think
Waiting there for me
Just for me
Like aeroplanes that hung on ropes
In far off worlds through telescopes
Faces in a photograph
Tired and worn
And torn in half
