Do you remember your summer thoughts on the grass, how we laughed?
Do you remember the mad love that was shared in your room?
I still have the card that says we're two years strong
I know I'm a pain sometimes but I don't love you any less
I still remember you'd turn up at my door, unannounced
Hold my face in your hands, so selfish, short-shout "I love you"
Beamed so proud, I took comfort from cutting into you
With a face full of wonder from the boy and the man I knew
Feel
I can choose to aim, stake my claim, I am born again, it's real, real, oh
So you think you're tough, I've had enough, I'm made of stronger stuff
Lives left looping on a gradual decay
Sitting on the bed, freshly made
Pretending we weren't led astray again
By the damage to ruin
The things we're doing are low down
Good for nothing, mistake making fool
Once part of something good
But now I feel, feel
I can shoot an aim, stick my twang
I am born again
And it's real, real, so you think you're tough, I've had enough, I'm at a stronger self
I have to learn to swim all over again
Heard a lot of talk about the ocean
Heard a lot of talk about the seas
That there's plenty of fish that would want me
But I'm numb from their words
The advice and the shame
It washes over me and washes away
You're so black and white and emoting a free carry on in spite of me
You're so black and white and emoting a free carry on in spite of me
No closer to the treasure chest than when imposed the picket fence
It's getting harder to feel
Feel real
I can't choose to aim, stake my claim
But I am born to get it
Feel real
So you think you're tough, I'm dead enough
I'm made of stronger
Feel real (no one wants to strike no matter what)
I can't choose to aim, stake my claim
But I am born to get it
You used to make me wanna lose myself
Now I can't think of nothing else but me
So you think you're tough, I'm headin' out the bed, I'll drive us home
So once, there was more, we lived the lesson
No one once was bright, now we're dirty blue
With lack of logic buried in your pocket, burning a hole within
You used to make me wanna lose myself
Now I can't think of nothing else but me
And I ain't gonna be the one dragging them with it
Black or white or the morning debris
To carry all the spite I need
You're so black or white or the morning debris
To carry all the spite I need
No closer to the treasure chest
The one impulse to kick advance
It's getting harder to feel
