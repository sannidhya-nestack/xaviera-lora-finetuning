If I've done you wrong
Remember I've done right by you too
You say you're not this strong
To carry on as me and you
And I say oh oh don't let go
Cause I can never find another one like you I know
Oh, don't let go
Please baby, please don't let go of you and me
Don't let go
Don't let go
I'd do anything for you
Lately I feel there's nothing I can do, right?
You know I didn't mean to make you cry
I wipe away the tear drops from your eye
Now I'm just trying to survive another night without you
Oh, oh, don't let go
I could never find another one like you, I know, oh
Oh, don't let go
Please, baby, please
Don't let go of you and me
real love ain't something that you find
Every day of your life
Before you make up your mind
To throw me out your door
I'm gonna ask you once more
Don't let go
Oh, oh, don't let go
I can never find another one like you, I know
Oh, oh, don't let go
Please baby please, you got me down on my knees
Please baby please, don't let go of you and me
Don't let go
Don't let go
Oh oh oh
Don't let go
Cause I can never find another one like you I know
Oh oh oh
Don't let go
Please baby please
Don't let go of you and me
Oh oh oh
Don't let go
Oh, oh, don't let go
Oh, oh, don't let go
Please baby, please don't let go of you and me
Oh, oh, don't let go
