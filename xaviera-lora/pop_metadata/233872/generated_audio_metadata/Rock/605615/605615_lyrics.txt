Come on, come on, come on and let's go
We're about to get down
Get up, get up, get up and let's roll
Let's rock this crazy town
I know the way to get there
We'll lose our realm of loving mind
Get in, roll out, light up and let's fly
Make our forever time
Got to escape to a rhythmical world
Beware the magic is real
I wanna dance right under the sky beneath the shining moon
Down to the edge of the ocean not far where the ladies sway in swoon
Move into them, name it to you, your body synchronize
Louder, louder, we're in a trance, ooh hypnotized
Got to escape to a musical world, me where the magic is real
Yes, these will be the good times
Yes, no better state of mind
Good times
Afro, Cubano, Latin and Jazz
They all speak the same
Just like a heartbeat rhythm beats free
Connecting you and me
Move into their language and you
Feel the rhythm and beat
La la la la we're in a jam
the night and morning meet
Got to escape to a rhythmical world
Be where the magic is real
Yes, these will be the good times
Yeah, these will be the good times
Come on, come on, come on and let's go
We're about to get down
Get up, get up, get up and let's roll
Gonna rock this crazy town
I know the way to get there
With those I've never loved in minds
Get in, roll out, light up and let's fly
Make our forever time, yes
These will be the good times
Yeah, no better state of mind
Yes, these will be the good times
Woo! Yeah!
These will be the good times, oh!
