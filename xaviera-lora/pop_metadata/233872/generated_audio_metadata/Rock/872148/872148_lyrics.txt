I want to confess as honest as I can
But my heart stops beating
And I don't understand
A contradiction
From the place you were in
Say it now, surrender my soul
I'm so sick of the tears that will flow
From the fire that's inside your eyes
Oh mother, send me to this land
Where I'll start sinking in an ocean of sand
Like the wish of some
Seize the evening, say it now
Surrender my soul
I'm so sick of the tears that will flow
From the fire that's inside your life
Please leave me alone
I'm so sick of the words that will show
All the hatred that's inside your mind
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say it now, surrender my soul
I'm so sick of the tears that we flow
Say it now, surrender my soul
I'm so sick of the tears that we flow
Say it now, surrender my soul
I'm so sick of the tears that will flow
Say it now, surrender my soul
I'm so sick of the tears that will flow
Say it now, surrender my soul
I'm so sick of the tears that will flow
Say it now
I'm so sick of the tears that won't fall, say it now, surrender my soul, I'm so sick of the tears that won't fall, say it now, surrender my soul, I "m so sick of the tears that won't fall
