It's okay, things just turned out this way
Gotta trust
A universe made for the both of us
Take my hand
Take me to your promised land
It's alright
I don't see the need to fight
Go back
It's simple like an eight track
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's all too sad, love like no other can
Feel the breeze
Cut through the sunkissed tree
Oh what a find
The beauty of your mind
Live today
It might be your last they say
Go back
Simple like an 8 track
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
