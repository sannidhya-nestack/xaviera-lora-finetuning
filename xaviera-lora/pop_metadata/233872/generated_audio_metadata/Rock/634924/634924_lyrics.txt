The more you scream at me, the wider I smile
The more you push, the more you're driving me wild
The more you weep, you know your battle will fall
You won't get the best of me, keep going your call
Never say never, never say die
Never give up or let the good pass me by
Never say maybe, never give in
Never lose hope or it's time to begin again
Can't trust your judgement when emotions erode
The change by the hour is the look of the draw
It's just a game that they all wanna play
I'll tell you something, you won't get in my way
What you gonna do, what you gonna say, what you gonna take away
Wanna even try, then you'll make my day
I never want, I never looked, I won't look the side you're on
You better keep your head,'cause it's coming right off
Never say never, never say die
Never give up or let the good days be by
Never say maybe, never give in
Never lose hope or it's time to begin again
Never say never, never say die
Never give up on life, the good past means bye
Never say maybe, never give in
Never lose hope or we'll have to begin again
Never say never again
Never never again
Never say never again
Never never again
What you gonna do? What you gonna say?
It's just a game that they all wanna play
Never say never, never say die
Never say die, never say die
