Ooh, single glance
For far too long I've been hanging on
Hoping that things would change
You've got the heart of a wanderer
You play just last in ways
I don't know why someone else would deny
The love between you and I
Tear it up and burn it down
Pull my heart to the ground
You think it's a single glance, a single glance
How nice when we're apart
We spent one time over here
It cut right through me, cut right through my heart
It's single glance
And now I hear an empty song
No more melody
Close the door and turn the key
Bitter sweet memories
You think it's single glance
Or single dance
Unless when we're apart
We'll spend one time over here
They cut right through me
Cut right through my heart
Ooh, single glance
But this time, I'm moving on
I'm not a player, I play by the rules
Turn the cards and spin the wheel
Don't wanna end up playing the fool
Single glance
Single glance, single glance, a single dance
Homeless when we're apart
We spend our time over her
The cut right through me, cut right through it
Single glance, single glance, don't ask me for second chance
We'll spend one time over here
The car ride through me
Car ride through my heart
Single glance, a single glance
Ooh, a single glance
Single glance, a single glance
Ooh, a single glance
Single glance, a single glance
Ooh, she don't cry (to the ones who've seen no cries)
Ooh, she don't cry
