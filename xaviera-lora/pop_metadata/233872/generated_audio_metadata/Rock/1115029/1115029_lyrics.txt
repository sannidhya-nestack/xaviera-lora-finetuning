It's just another day, another day, another day, another day of working hard
And we will never fit in this place
We will never win this red ring
We gotta fight to break out
I have to get out of here
And into the clear
Out of the fear
And into the free
The land of the free
It's just another day, another day, another day, another day of work and sloth
And it's the dollar that traps us here
The slavery of the fear
We gotta finally break out
Ah-ha, get out of here
And into the clear
Out of the fear
And into the free
The land of the free
The lands of the free
Oh, the dollars and cents
The lands of the free
Oh, the bills and the bill
The lands of the free
The home of the slave
The land of the free, the home of the slave
