Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Under a blood red moon
Eighteenth century cane plantation
A secret locked in a room
Buried under a cold temptation
Throughout the years, through all time
In the dark without the light
Ring on the night
And I'm waiting for him that will never come
It's your light
Falling from the light of the rising sun
It's your light
In a world without time
A reflection of our insanity
Dark spirit design
All for the sake of vanity
Throughout the years
Through all time
In the dark
Without the light
Bring on the light
And I'm waiting for one that will never come
Eternal life
Falling from the light of the rising sun
Eternal life
Waiting for the darkness to overrun
Eternal life
Playing in the streets till the night is down
Eternal, eternal
Rewonder through twilight
There's nothing left, there's no one here
Dark shadows, no feeling
The emptiness would disappear
Disappear
Waiting for the darkness to overrun
Praying in the streets'til the night is done
Waiting for words that will never come
It's your life
Falling from the light of the rising sun
It's your life
Waiting for the darkness to overrun
It's your life
Playing in the streets till the night is done
It's your, it's your
