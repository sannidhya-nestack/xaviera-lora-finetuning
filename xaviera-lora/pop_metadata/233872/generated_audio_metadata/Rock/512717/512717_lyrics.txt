I'm on another mountaintop, searching through my memories of you
Sometimes I don't know why, everything in my life's for you
Wishing on a star
Wishing on a broken heart
I don't know where you are
Now that we have grown apart
And now you'll never know a new tomorrow
Feel like all I had achieved has been lost into the sea
Because of what you did was just what I wanted
And what I said was just broken promises
Wishing on a star, wishing on a broken heart
I don't know where you are
Now that we have grown apart
Every second you're gone
It's a second too long
With each breath that I take
You'll live on and on and on
Wishing on a star
Wishing on a broken heart
I don't know where you are, now that we have grown apart
Wishing on a star, wishing on a broken heart
I don't know where you are, now that we have grown apart
I'm on another mountain top
Searching through my memories of you
Sometimes I don't know why, oh why
Everything in my life's for you
