I keep my whole life private
I got it down to a science
I'm also likely to contradict
Especially singing a song like this
I rock a weird ass diet
You probably would not like it
I don't fuck around with your trends
I don't look like all your friends yeah yeah
Yes, life's not a puzzle, we don't all fit
Stop forcing the pieces
Do you, do you, do you wanna step inside of my world?
Do you, do you, do you take an oyster just for the pearl?
You might not like what you see
Don't take it personally, that's just me
I keep my loud mouth quiet
I recommend you try it
Don't wanna listen to you talk all night
Unless you talking bout how I'm right
Not here to start a riot
It's a little punk rock riot
I'm just aggressive and OCD
A little crazy but that's just me
Yeah, yeah
This life's not a puzzle
We don't all fail
Stop forcing the pieces
Do you, do you, do you
Wanna step inside of my world?
Do you, do you, do you
Take a noise to just fool the world?
You might not like what you see
Don't take it personally, that's just me
Do you, do you, do you
Know a life outside of the world
Do you, do you, do you
Take an oyster just for the pearl
Not who you want me to be
Don't take it personally
That's just me, that's just me
That's just me, that's just me
Take it or leave, that's just me
Take it or leave
That's just me
That's just me
That's just me
That's just me
That's just me
That's just me
And this is easy
I don't know, I'm okay with it
Do you, do you, do you
Wanna step inside of my world? (Inside of my world)
Do you, do you, do you
Taking oysters just for the pearl?
You might not like what you see
But just trust me
Do you, do you, do you
Know a life outside of the world?
That's just me (Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Take it or leave it (It's not just for the part)
I'm not who you want me to be (Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Don't take it personally
That's just me
