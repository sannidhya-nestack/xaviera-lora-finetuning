Check this little thing to find out now
I should be wanted by the DA, yeah
I'm in double trouble down into your days (oh yeah)
And I feel haunted by your mysterious ways
I'm feeling shivers down my spine when I see your face
But I'm out of bounds (yeah) when you start to sway
Can't keep the habit of your body flying over me
Are you flying over me?
Loving you gotta be the darkest thing I've done
Oh yes, so dark
From black to blue till my heart turns slowly numb, yeah
Forbidden fruit, tastes just better on the tongue
But no one, no one, no one, no one, no one told me
Loving you is contraband
You should have told me, oh no
You should have told me, oh no
You're a magnet
For misery
I go cold turkey when you're wandering to change your ways
Come on, you should be grinding
For a drink of red
I never knew what really hit me'til you got to me
Loving you
Gotta be the darkest thing I've done
From black to blue
my heart turned slowly numb
Forbidden fruit
Tastes just better on the tongue
But no one, no one, no one, no one, no one told me
Loving you is contraband
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on give it to me
Hey, huh
Come on
Loving you, gotta be the darkest thing I've done
From black to blue,'til my heart turns slowly numb
Forbidden fruit, taste just better on the tongue
No one, no one, no one, no one, no one told me
Loving you is contraband
