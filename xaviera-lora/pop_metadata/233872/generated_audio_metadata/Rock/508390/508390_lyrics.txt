Since the first time I met her
I knew I'd never et her
Now she has gone
From the first day I saw her
I knew I'd live my life for her
Now she has gone
Let me down and let me fly
I should have known when I met her
That I would live to regret her
Now she has gone
I was so glad when I found her
But now I see round her
Now she has gone
Let me down and let me fly
I was so glad when I found her
But now I see round her
Now she is gone
Let me down and let me fly
