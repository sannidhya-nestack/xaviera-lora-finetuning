Right here all around me
We'll all have a time
And right there right behind me
You can fall in line
Yes I'm partly wasted
But the fall's not mine
It's this sweet young lady made me lose my mind
But I'm not sure maybe it's me or maybe I'm just out of line
You don't have to leave yet
We could dance all night, all night
It's not my intention to be Mr. Right
Maybe Mr. Right now
But I'm not sure maybe it's me
Or maybe I'm just out of line
I can be just what you need
At least better than the rest could
And I can wake you from this dream
Putting you back to where you should be
And I would love to take you home
At least where we can lie down
And you are exactly what I need
A vacation from me
And you should know
Better than me
That this is something that we both see
I can be just what you need
At least better than the rest could
And I can wake you from this dream
Bring you back to where you should be
And I would love to take you home
At least where we can lie down
And you are exactly what I need
A vacation from me
I would love to take you home, at least where we can lie down
