Took some time to come around
I led myself through rusted towns
I blew my horn for all around were weary ones
Come here my son, weary one, you're dearer to me
And when my ship had run aground
A selfish heart was all I found
The storm that broke the fury sound
Sang weary ones, come here my son
Weary one, you're dearer to me
And love has no way to hide her light
She loves the darkest night
Mmm, mmm, mmm
So write a letter, send it down
Sing your song with subtle sound
Blow your horn for all around our weary ones
Come here my son, weary one, you're dearer to me
And love has no way to hide her light
She loves the darkest night
