It makes me get louder when I think about her
I can smell her perfume and god damn it is out of this world
Come over here and sit next to me
Your eyes are always changing, right now they're amazing, even prettier blazed in a squinted gaze
What a girl, don't take your sunshine off of me
Kinda funny but I'm drawn to you, to your energy
You look cold with those grey blues and you got me easily'cause your vibe
Makes me high
So tonight
You got a chance of light
Come and spread your light
Baby please
Never take your sunshine off of me
Never take your sunshine off of me
Never ever take your sunshine off me
Never take your sunshine off of me
Never take your sunshine off of me
You can continue your browsing as I sing aloud
You're so inspiring and lovely ahead in the cloud
Do you know what your kind soul does to me
And such a talented girl
I can't wait'til the world can see
The beauty you capture while you flip your curls
I'm amazed
To you it comes so easily
You reply as I continue to ride
Right about my life
All I need is a few seconds of your time
And to make my whole day right
Plus your vibe
It makes me high
So tonight, you gotta spread your light
Come and shed your light, baby please
Never take your sunshine off of me
Never take your sunshine off of me
Never ever take your sunshine off me
Never take your sunshine off of me
Never take your sunshine off of me
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
