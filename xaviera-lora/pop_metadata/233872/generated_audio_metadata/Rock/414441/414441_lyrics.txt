Someone's been telling lies
They're coming back to you
I see them in your eyes
There's nothing you can say
Not giving you one more day of my life
And now you gotta stay away from here
Look at all the pain you caused us dear
I just wanna watch you disappear
Stay away from here
I'm not what you may think
Not just another kiss
You take me for something weak
I've had enough of this
I'm not giving you one more day of my life
And now you gotta stay away from here
Look at all the pain you caused us dear
I just wanna watch you disappear
Stay away from here
Stay away
Stay away
I was crazy to be with you, baby and now
It's over'cause you're not worth it
I'm not willing to make another mistake
Stay away
Stay away
And now you gotta stay away from here
Look at all the pain you caused us dear
I just wanna watch you disappear
Stay away from here
Look at all the pain you caused us dear
I just wanna watch you disappear
Stay away from here
Stay away, stay away
You gotta stay away, stay away
