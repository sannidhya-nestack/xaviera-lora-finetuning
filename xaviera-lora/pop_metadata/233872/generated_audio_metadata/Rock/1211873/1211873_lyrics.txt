He said that it's over, this time's the end
My eyes wet from crying, can we not make amends
Can't think of a reason, after all we've been through
Thought we had something special
But you play with the truth
I'm blue for you
And I just can't let it go
But I'm weak and I'm broken
So tired of being alone
I'm blue for you
I find it hard to walk away
And now I search for an answer
So to come back to stay
Come back to stay
Every night I keep calling
And it's always the same
I deliver my heartache
Through a message of pain
No regard for my feelings
As you push me aside
You show others commitments instead of giving me time
I'm blue for you and I just can't let it go
But I'm weak and I'm broken so tired of being alone
I'm blue for you
I find it hard to walk away
Now I search for an answer
So you come back to stay
I feel broken
Blue for you
It's so hard to take
I'm blue for you
Need an answer
I'm blue for you
Won't you come back to stay
I'm blue for you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm blue for you
And I just can't let it go
But I'm weak and I'm broken
So tired of being alone
I'm blue for you
I find it hard to walk away
And now I search for an answer
Said she'd come back to stay
