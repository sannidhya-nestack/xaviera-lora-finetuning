Train coming and the steam is rolling
Train coming up around the bend
Train coming with the Savior on it
He's gonna make it right again
Gonna grab that soul and take it for a ride
Gonna find out what you really got inside
Been living in a boneyard lately
Been hanging in a hurry fall
One lady man it seemed temptation
Can't ever seem to let it go
Gonna grab that soul and take it for a ride
Gonna find out who you really are inside
Train is a coming for your life
We need to make a quest of it
Committing to the best of it
Relying on the warnings of the times
Connect the dots to where they go
Instigate another show
Motivated by the way we try
One morning when your heart is weeping
One morning when the dole is high
The train coming with the Savior on it
He gonna try to make you right
Gonna grab that soul and take it for a ride
Train
The rain is a coming for you and me
We need to make a quest of it
Committing to the best of it
Relying on the warnings of the times
Connect the dots to where they go
Instigate another show
Motivated by the way we try
