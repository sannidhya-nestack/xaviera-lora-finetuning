I'm a local boy with nothing to do
I go crazy for a girl like you
The way you walk up on the street
You're the kind of girl I like to meet
I go crazy for something new
I go crazy for a girl like you
First your armpit, then your leg
On the honey, baby, please don't play
Taste so good, you taste so fine
All I need is my bottle of wine
Go crazy for something new
Go crazy for a girl like you
Sweet boy yeah, made me sleep all night
Need no snacks, it's all you need tonight
Please don't manifest, please don't shout
Love and sacrifice is what it's all about
Go crazy for something new
Go crazy for a girl like you
Go
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
