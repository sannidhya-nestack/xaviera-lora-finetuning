I've had my share of everything that's good
I've done a lot of things I never thought I could
Now it's time to go, I can't hear the call
But if you think that you've been had
You know it's not my fault
You know it's not my fault
I've lived in many places, known a lot of folks
Told a thousand stories, heard a million jokes
Now I see the chance to really have it all
If you think you just can't make it, you know it's not my fault
Jesus rolled on the wild, it's a habit of his.
[Silence]
>> Shut down, shut down, shut down.
You know it's not my fault
Yeah, you know it's not my fault
Keep going
You know it's not my fault
You still it's not my fault
You know it's not my fault
