Where there's a well, there's a way
When there's a long, long night that's bound to be a day
When you're sliding down from the mountain top
If there's a way to go, then there's a way to stop
Well, I've been down such a long, long time that I'm here to say
Now I'm feeling fine where there's a will must be a way
You take what's left and try to make it right
You can run and hide or you can stand up and fight
If you are lost then you can be found
You can suffer in silence or you can love that sound
Well I've been down such a long long time
And I'm here to say that I'm feeling fine where there's a will
There must be a way
Nod your head yes
Or shake it no no no
If you come to a stop
I say, "Go, go, go"
Some say, "Why?"
I say, "Why not?"
You can take what you get
Or give what you got
Well, I've been down such a long, long time
And I'm here to say that I'm feeling fine, where's the will?
There must be a way
Oh, I've been down such a long, long time
And I'm here to say that I'm feeling fine
Where there's a will
There must be a way
I feel, I feel, I feel
I feel, I feel, I feel
I feel, I feel, I feel
I feel, I feel, I feel
I feel, I feel, I feel
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
