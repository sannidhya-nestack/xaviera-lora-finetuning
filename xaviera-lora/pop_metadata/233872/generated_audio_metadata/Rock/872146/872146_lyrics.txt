Hey, I never felt like this before
And this drink, it is responsible
So how about a little kiss, no wait?
A second chance was made for this
Let me prove I'm un ettable
And let us dance and take my risk
Diamonds falling from the sky
The night is red, I wonder why
The moon is growing bigger than our souls
We are stars
Everything is going right
Luck and love are on our side
Up above we are stars
Everything is going fine
And tonight we are alive, you're in control
'Cause these lips are uncontrollable
Let them take you to a place where you and I are unreplaceable
So I let all kindness out of way
I'll separate birds from the bees, create a moment for infinity
Diamonds falling from the sky, the night is red, I wonder why
The moon is growing bigger than our souls, we are stars
Everything is going right
Luck and love are on our side
Up above, we are stars (we are stars)
Everything is going fine
And tonight we are alive, you're in control
What you never wanted to say
Is what was always there in the open
And you never wanted to be
Stay together, close with me
Now I speak to the heavens above me
Save on fire, rescue me
We are stars
Everything is going right
Luck and love are on our side
Up above
We are stars
Everything is going fine
And tonight we are alive
You're in control
But you never wanted to see what was always there in your bed
And you never wanted to be, stay together, we'll close the gate
Now it's really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really coming out
And tonight we are out of our fucking control
