Riding on a highway without you by my side
Memories in my head, my voice and it makes me cry
Just along the road and many miles for me
I don't know where I'll go, just follow my wheels
In the middle of the night
I feel the air on my face
Stars up above talk about you
Look at me and light my way
Oh my sweet love
I'm feeling so alone
I don't know what I'm looking for
Maybe a reason to go on
Running into the air
I try to et your eyes
You still live in my heart
Running into the wind
I try to et your hair
But I need you again
that love will never end
You have been my breath
My life and all my dreams
Now I miss you so much
While the morning breeze dries my tears
Oh, I'm doing better
Another day opens its door
My mind is clearer now
I know what to do, my lord
We're riding into the heaven
I can't find your eyes
I wanna live in your heart
We're riding into the sky
I can't see again your smile
I need you again
And our love will never end
And our love will never end
Running into the air
I can't remember your smile
You still live in my heart
Running into the sun
I can't remember your face
But I need you again
that love will never end
that love will never end
