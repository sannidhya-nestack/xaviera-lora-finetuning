I crawled out of bed this morning
My mouth felt like a desert storm
Eyes looked like road maps
Painted red like a rose
The night before was just a memory
To our love you said goodbye
Now I'm already over you
And I'm feeling fine
I drank down a little coffee
Oh, it had the wrong kind of fire
I needed something more to heat up my heart
And take me just a little bit higher
So I grabbed what's left of my bottle
And Lord, I drank it dry
Now I'm already over you and I'm feeling fine, oh
I found the pieces of the puzzle, it's no mystery
And I don't know why I kept trying to hold on
Worth thinking I was wrong
What we had is over and I'll et about those things we said
I know I can look at myself start all over again
So when you ask me how I'm doing
Don't trouble your worried mind
Cause I'm already over you and I'm feeling fine, yeah
Feeling fine
I was good to you baby
You know I'm feeling fine
Feeling fine
