It's sad to see I lost my friend
A tragedy
Can't pretend that I
Well, I guess this is the end
It's sad to see
No cut the sand
Apology
Cannot mend, and I
Well, I guess this is the end
It's sad to see
The joke's on me
It's plain to see that you are gone
It's plain to see I was so wrong
It's sad to see
It's sad to see
It's sad to see
It's sad to see
And I guess this is the end
It's sad to see
The joke's on me
It's sad to see
The joke's on
I get the joke, I get the joke, I get the joke,
I get the joke and it's on me
Get the joke, it's on me, it's on me
Get the joke, it's on me
Can't get you
Can't get you
Can't get you
