I'm just a little girl, I'm just a little girl
Oh, I like getting high

I'm just that kind of guy
Oh, I'd like to get stoned
With someone else or by myself alone
I'm always ready to burn another bone
I sure like getting high
Oh, I like getting high

I like getting high
I'm just that kind of guy
Oh, I like getting high (yep, I do)

Reaching for that thing
As soon as I wake
Because I sure like to get baked
Oh, I like getting high
