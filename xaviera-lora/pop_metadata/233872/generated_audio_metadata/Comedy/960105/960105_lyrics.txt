I'd give you my heart
If it didn't leave a gaping wound in my chest
I'd give you my lips, oh yeah
If I didn't drool when I drank
I'd give you my soul
But I'm white so I don't have much to give
What I wouldn't give to you
I'd give you my ears
But that didn't work for Van Gogh
I'd give you my eyes, eyes
But I need my vowels to speak
I'd give you my nose
But that's probably not something you'd pick
What I wouldn't give to you
But now you're gone
I guess I waited, waited too long
all you ever wanted was a hand
With the laundry, with the dishes, just a hand
With the kids, with the shopping, just a hand
All you ever wanted was a hand
Please, please, no, no, I tried that
It did not go over well
