This is a song for the men out in the audience
We want you to know we understand (we do, yeah, we really do)
Sometimes when you're living with a woman (well, it really doesn't matter what you do)
if you do or if you don't, you're damned
It starts sounding like a simple question
But you know there is more than that at stake
if you get the wrong answer to this question
The sofa will be your only mate
And the question goes something like
Honey, do I look fat in this dress?
Now tell me what are you gonna say?
No, no honey, you don't look fat in that dress
You mean I look fat in some other way?
The problem lies in the question
And that it has passed from her lips
She thinks your love's connected to what is on her hips
So when you hear, "Honey, do I look fat in this dress?"
Say, "I want you, I want you now"
Honey, you mean I look good in this dress?
So good, let me show you how
You need to answer the deeper question
Is your love for me still deep and true? You say
Honey, I love you more now than when we said I do
