One day a buzzard fell out of the sky
The final words he spoke we can't deny
Whether man or bird or elephant
We will all become trace elements
Yes, we'll all turn to compost by and by
By and by (by and by)
By and by (by and by)
Yes, we'll all turn to compost by and by
When our souls are all arising
Our remains are fertilizing
we'll all turn to compost by and by
I saw a new age undertaker from L .A.
Said he'd show me all his caskets on display
His intentions weren't debatable, they were all biodegradable
Cause we'll all turn to compost by and by
By and by, by and by
Yes, we'll all turn to compost by and by
When they lay you six feet down
You'll enrich this hallowed ground
we'll all turn to compost by and by
So your time has come to bid this earth farewell
And you hadn't done much good that you can tell
There's no need for an apology
You're still good for the ecology
we'll all turn to compost by and by
By and by (by and by)
By and by (by and by)
Yes, we'll all turn to compost by and by
You'll improve your own self worth
While replenishing the earth
we'll all turn to compost by and by
Think of all the good you'll do
When you turn to CO2
Yes, we'll all turn to compost
By and by
In the sweep, by and by
We will meet on that recycled shore
