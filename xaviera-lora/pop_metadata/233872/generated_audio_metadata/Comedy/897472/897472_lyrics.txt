I don't want to be alone
Someone please throw me a bone
If only I wasn't lonely
Some like oranges and that's fair
But I would rather be a pear
If only I wasn't lonely
I wish that I was just more like a bull
Then I could ride this tandem bicycle
I don't want to be alone
Call me on a telephone
If only I was not lonely
I don't want to be alone
All my meetings get postponed
If only I wasn't lonely
Some like Shakespeare's sweet sonnets
I wish I was a rhyming couplet
If only I wasn't lonely
Solitaire's my only game of cards
Badminton alone is really hard
I don't want to be alone
I'll write that on my tombstone
If only
I had another crony
Why's everyone so stony?
My life is just baloney
Oh if only
I wasn't so alone
