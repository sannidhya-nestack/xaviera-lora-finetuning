A couple years ago I was, for a fundraiser, I was asked to pose on a nude calendar with a bunch of other pasty, out of shape musicians.
And the photographer decided he wanted me to sit in this little plastic chair with a 60 pound keyboard on my lap.
I decided this was far too precious an event to leave unheralded in song.
And so I wrote this ode to the men of August.
My mama raised me modest, virtuous and true
I never meant to cause her any grief
And so I'm loath to mention that despite her best intention
I seem to have turned over a new leaf
I'm Mr. August, bearing it all
Hung in your kitchen, tacked to your wall
Ain't it sublime, hey baby, I'm Mr. August
I have to admit it, I look pretty swell
Out in the garden, oh natural
Did anyone bring a little sunscreen for Mr. August?
I got a little bit nervous when I was pressed into service
So late in the year
All that exposure would impair my composure
And put a crimp in my career
Well, I might look happy, but you'd be surprised
There's a piano crushing my thighs
Eighty-eight keys putting the squeeze on Mr. August
You know it's hard to perform when you can't get warm
And you're wearing the bare essentials
You brought me luck, you warmed me up
And unleashed my potential
Well, we knew when this started
It couldn't last
Soon Mr. A would slip into the past
It's nearly time to say goodbye to Mr. August
Now days grow shorter and sweet summer fades
So blow me a kiss and flip up my page
We had a good run
I hope you had fun with Mr. Allgood
You can be sure I'll always be your Mr. Allgood
Doesn't time just fly
