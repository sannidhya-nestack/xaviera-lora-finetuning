They say (I'll tell you what I'm talking about)
They say (huh)
I came across an email
And downloads of you posing in the nude
I even printed a picture of
The digitally enhanced you
I've been to all the chat rooms
Like the one that I first met you in
I know I should be sleeping
And not indulging in their cyber sin
They say you can shop for anything online
Closing records, even sex ads all the time
They say you can fall in love online
I believed and now I'm losing my mind
By living my life online
I've come to the conclusion
That this is not where we're supposed to be
I can't stand the confusion of
This lonely life we all seem to lead
It's time for me to wake up
Beam me back from virtual cyber fantasy
Some things aren't meant to be
Lived offline in reality
They say you can jump for anything online
Closing records even sex sells all the time
They say you can fall in love online
I believed and now I'm losing my mind
They say you can shop for anything online
Closing records, even sex ads all the time
They say you can fall in love online
I believed and now I'm losing my mind
By living my life
I'll tell you what I'm talking about
They say you can shop for anything online
Closing records, even sex sales all the time
They say you can fall in love online
I believed it, now I'm losing my mind
They say you can shop for anything online
Closing records, even sex ads all the time
They say you can fall in love online
I believed and now I'm losing my mind
By living my life online
Losing my mind online
Wasting my time online
They say, yeah, they say, yeah, they say
