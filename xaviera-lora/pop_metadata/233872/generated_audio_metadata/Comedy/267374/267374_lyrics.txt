In the spring of'29 on a cabin porch in Caroline
Libby Congress sang so loud and shrill
And the cackle of her voice still makes me ill
She wrote the music and the words about wildwood flowers and mockingbirds
And all that stuff you're not supposed to kill
And when she hovers round the stage it gives me chills
I see her ghost in lonesome valleys
From Music Row to Tin Pan Alley
She walks these hills on dark and stormy nights
I'm the creep who stole her copyrights
I came up to her mountain home
With a tape recorder and a microphone
Said, "Pretty maid, sing your tunes for me
And I'll save your songs for all posterity"
I headed back to Bristol town and there I passed her songs around
Sang her lines with no thought of permission
Said I found them in the mountains, their tradition
I see her ghost in lonesome valleys from Music Road
To Tin Pan Alley she walks these hills
On dark and stormy nights
Cause I'm the jerk who stole her copyrights
She got sick and passed away
Her songs grew famous anyway
And I'm a star on the Grand Ole Opry
And no one knows who wrote those tunes but me
I pray to those in music heaven for all my sins
To be iven'cause Libby's like a bloodhound on my trail
Chasing me in her dirty long black veil
I see her ghost in lonesome valleys
From Music Row to Tin Pan Alley
She walks these hills on dark and stormy nights
I'm the klutz who stole her copyright
I'm the potz who stole her copyright
(Howl)
