You were born this day hip hip hooray so we threw this party for you
But with due respect we must not et the one who conceived and bore you
Let's drink a toast to your mother it's the least that we can do
It's your mother's birthday too
For nine long months she groans and grunts and turns into a teepee
Then out you slid and all you did was breastfeed and go pee-pee
So pick up the phone and call her, it's the least that you can do
It's your mother's birthday too
For sixteen years you cause her tears while she works her fingers bony
She bakes you pie while she scrapes by on crackers and baloney
So pick up the phone and call her
It's the least that you can do
It's your mother's birthday too
Then one fine day you move away
Say and see you at Thanksgiving
Will she build you a shrine
As she spends her time asking if life is worth living
So pick up the phone and call her
It's the least that you can do
It's your mother's birthday too
Do you think you're so special
Go on take a bow
But without your mother
Where would you be now?
How how how how how how
Would it ask so much you ungrateful putz
To think of her more often
How will you sleep you selfish creep
When you put her in her coffin
So pick up the phone and call her
It's the least that you can do
It's your mother's birthday too
Pick up the phone and call her
It's the least that you can do
It's your mother's birthday too
