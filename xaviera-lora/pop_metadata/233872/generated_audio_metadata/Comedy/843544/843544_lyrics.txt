Bada bing, bada boom
Gonna swing that thing, gonna need a little room
Bada bing, bada boom (bada bing, bada boom)
Bada bing, bada boom (bada bing, bada boom)
Hey, everybody, one, two, one, two, three
Bada bing, bada boom (baba bing, bada boom)
When you hear the sound
Everybody get down, kick your shoes off
Get your little woo
Pick your partner's collar up
To the wood floor, scoot for your heart
Let's start, everybody swing down (everybody swing down)
Bada bing, bada boom
Gonna swing that thing, gonna need a little room
Bada bing, bada boom (baga bing, bada boom)
Bada bing, bada boom (baka bing, bada boom)
And a balla one, two, one, two, three, a balla bing, a balla boom (balla bing, balla boom)
When you hear this song, everybody come along
Throw your hips out, pat your lips
Kiss on your neck, your date your a winner
Spin a solo, let's go
Everybody swing now (everybody swing now)
Bada bing, bada boom
Won't swing nothing, don't need little room
Bada bing, bada boom (bada bing, bada boom)
Bada bing, bada boom (bada bing, bada boom)
Everybody one two, one two three
Bada bing, bada boom (bada bing, bada boom)
Gonna sing in harmony, no harmony
Then someone solo, it's no fun
Shake it like a loose goose, follow me
Hoochie, coochie, one, two, three
Bada bing, bada boom
Gonna swing that thing, gonna need a little room
Bada bing, bada boom (bada bing, bada boom)
Bada bing, bada boom (bada bing, bada boom)
Hey, in a bottle, one, two, one, two, three
Bada bing, bada boom (bada bing, bada boom)
Hey, in a bottle, bing
Bada boom
Gonna swing that thing, gonna need a little room
Bada bing, bada boom (bada bing, bada boom)
Bada bing, bada boom (bada bing, bada boom)
Hey, in a bottle, one, two, one, two, three
Bada bing, bada boom (bada bing, bada boom)
Love is in a bottle, one, two, one, two, three, bottle, bing, bottle, boom (bottle, bing, bottle, boom)
Everybody wants two, one, two, three, bottle, bing (bottle, bing)
Bottle boom (bottle, boom)
Bottle bing (bottle, bing)
Bottle boom
