Grandad, mum and auntie Nell
Would always find the time to tell
The stories of our good old black bull days
We'd board the steam train clean and bright
All pack in and hold on tight
And head off down to start those crazy ways
The sun was always shining through
It seemed the sea forever blue
And golden sands as far behind could see
We'd take a stroll along the prom
With jelly deals a bit later on
Yes Blackpool really was the place to be
Built sandcastles to the sky
And boy could our kites really fly
Then fish and chips and sometimes hot dogs too
With lots of onions, bangers and mash
Eat what you like, we had the cash
No matter what you ate, you saw it through
'Cause the sun was always shining through
It seemed to see forever blue
And golden sands as far beyond could see
We'd take a stroll along the prom
With jelly deals a bit later on
Yes Blackpool really was the place to be
Sun was always shining through
It seemed the sea forever blue
And golden sands as far as the eye could see
We'd take a stroll along the prom
With jelly deals a bit later on
Yes Blackpool really was the place to be
Take a visit to the pier
They'd all be laughing full of beer
And Uncle Bert would end up on the swings
Auntie Kate would turn up late
He'd say she's been to some old fete
Then nag Uncle Bert'cause when he's drunk he sings
sun was always shining through
It seemed the sea forever blue
And golden sands as far the eye could see
We'd take a stroll along the prom
With jelly deals a bit later on
Yes Blackpool really was the place to be
Yeah Blackpool really was the place to be
Yeah Blackpool really was the place to, to be
