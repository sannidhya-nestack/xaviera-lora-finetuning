I was driving one evening through the town of Paris, Texas
Looking for a place to spend the night
When I saw a red gumball flashing in my mirror
That seemed to me a most unwelcome sight
When I asked if there's a problem
The officer informed me that I'd gone and driven through a red stop sign
Then the next words that I heard
Let's see your driver's license sent a cold chill up and down my spine
Well my license been suspended and that's just what I told him
He nodded and he acted real polite
Then he offered me the back seat and he drove me to the Husqvarna
Where I was told that I would spend the night
Then they put me in a room at the downtown Paris Hilton
My room is eight by ten and has no view
Now I lie upon my back
Just staring at the ceiling
And waiting'til the sun comes shining through
When I finally got to court
The judge said please excuse me
But I think I've seen you here one time before
It's time you learned your lesson
And so you have my blessing
To enjoy our hospitality once more
For the next thirty days
I'm at the downtown Paris Hilton
My room is eight by ten and has no view
Now I lie upon my back
Just staring at the ceiling
And waiting'til the sun comes shining through
