I slipped on love, like on a banana
Thought it was fate, but it's just drama
She took my fries, and then my heart
Guess that's a very testy start
Oops again, I fall too fast
Like a clown at a circus act
Life's a joke, but I don't care, eee
At least we're railogging everywhere
He wore two shoes that didn't match
Still he called himself a catch
I dropped my phone into my soup
Now we're a crazy hungry group
Oops again I fall too fast
Like a clown at a circus act
Life's a joke but I don't care-y
At least we're railogging everywhere
So if the world turns upside down
Let's just dance and play the clown
Love's a comedy, let's confess
A funny mess, but still success
