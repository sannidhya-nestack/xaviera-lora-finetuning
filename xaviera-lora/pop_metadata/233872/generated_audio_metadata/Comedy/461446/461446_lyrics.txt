Hello friends, how are you on this beautiful day?
All comfy cozy are we? Good! I think you're ready for more
Tales of Terror!
Today Count Dracula goes to the dentist
Oh, Miss Fizzlebottom?
Yes, Doctor Yankham?
Would you send in the next patient, please?
Right away, Doctor!
All right, you may go in now, Mr...
I am Count Dracula!
Yes, sir, well, don't keep the doctor waiting! Go on in!
Well, good day, Mr...
I am Count Dracula!
Of course, of course, you don't have to yell about it.
Now, let's have a seat right here, shall we?
All right.
That's right. Let me take your cape and say that's a nice amulet you got there.
Yes, thank you. I got it over...
You know, if you're a good boy, I'll give you a sticker too. Would you like that?
Yes, that would be fine. I...
Good, good. Now you have absolutely nothing to be afraid of, Mr...
I...
M Count Dracula! I'm not afraid of anything!
Alright, alright, don't get excited now.
Do you have to play that pipe an all the time? Here, just give that to me.
But that's my an.
And you better give me that echo device you have there too.
But no, no, don't take that away. I need it.
Do you mind if I try it?
No, it's mine!
Testing, testing!
One, two, got a whole lot of love in!
Got a whole lot of love in!
Hey, that is fun!
Okay now, as I said, you have absolutely nothing to be afraid of
As long as you've been taking good care of your teeth
By the way, when was the last time you had a checkup?
Oh, maybe two, three hundred years ago, I think.
Well, that's a pretty long time, Mr. Count.
Yes, I know.
Have you been brushing and flossing twice a day?
No, I've...
Oh, Mr. Count, I have a feeling your mouth is a pretty scary place.
I've been told that before.
I'll just bet.
Well, let's just take a little peeky-boo, shall we?
That's right, open wide and say "ah."
Blah!
No, "ah"
Blah, blah
Mr. Count, I'm a busy man
A little cooperation is all I'm asking for
Now, please just open your mouth a little wider
That's it
Oh my
Look at the size of those two in front
Have you ever considered braces for those?
You must have gotten teased mercifully for those as a kid
Did they call you Bucky?
Okay, well let's have a look inside now. Here, let me get my little mirror stick. There we go. Now open wider. Hey, I can't see a thing in this mirror. Maybe, here, let me open up this window and let a little sun shine.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Okay, okay, that's fine. I think I've seen enough anyway.
Mr. Count, your teeth are in just terrible shape.
Really?
Oh yes. You've not been a good boy at all.
Everybody knows if you don't take good care of your teeth, then you're going to lose them.
Oh, no, you're not serious?
I'll have to pull your teeth.
No, no, don't worry. You can't be…
Don't worry, I'll give you a painkiller so it won't hurt a bit.
But, you know, that's what you get for not brushing and flossing twice a day.
I'll start tomorrow. I'll start tomorrow.
It's too late now. Open wide!
Well friends, how did you like our little tale?
I trust you know the moral
Take good care of your teeth or you're bound to get all gummed up
See you again for another Tales of Terror
