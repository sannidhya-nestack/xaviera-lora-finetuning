When I was younger I could kick some ass
Now I'm older and I'm feeling fast
Feels like I'm living in the days of future past
Stuck in the present but it ain't gonna last
As a young man I had lots of girls
I'd squeeze them and I'd tease them and I'd make their heads whirl
Now the daily counter bites my fire
I have to get myself a woman for hire, Paul
Agin' sucks, agin' sucks
Raging'cause I'm agin' and agin' sucks
Agin' sucks, agin' sucks
I'm raging'cause I'm agin' and agin's sucks
Hey you guys, you happy about getting older?
Aging sucks!
Well, then put down the remote, get up off the damn couch
Join in and let it all out
Aging sucks, aging sucks
Say it!
I'm raging'cause I'm aging and aging sucks
Can't hear ya!
Aging sucks, aging sucks
I'm raging'cause I'm aging and aging sucks
That's better
When I was younger I had a Corvette
as fast a car as you could get
I just sold it to a girl named Rhonda
Now I'm cruising in a four door Honda
Monday morning I sort my pills
Cause the toxins will cure my ills
Sit around with friends and reminisce
I'm getting older and I'm getting pissed because
Aging sucks, aging sucks
Raging cause I'm aging and aging sucks
Aging sucks, aging sucks
I'm reaching close I'm aging and aging sucks
Hey you millennials out there
They think this is pretty funny huh?
Well guess what, someday you can be where we're at
So you might as well join in too, because then you'll be singing
Aging sucks, aging sucks (you got it)
I'm raging'cause I'm aging and aging sucks (uh-huh)
Aging sucks, aging sucks (yeah)
I'm raging'cause I'm aging and aging sucks (once more)
Aging sucks, aging sucks (yeah)
I'm raging'cause I'm aging and aging sucks (Aging sucks, yeah, aging sucks)
I'm raging'cause I'm aging and aging sucks (Take him out!)
(Aging sucks!)
