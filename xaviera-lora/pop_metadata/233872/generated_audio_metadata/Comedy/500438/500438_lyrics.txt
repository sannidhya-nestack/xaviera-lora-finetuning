I wish I could yodel like my uncle said, champion yodelers in
I wish I could yodel like my uncle said he could yodel in any key
He could be in a minor, flat or sharp, F, A, D or C
Wish I could yodel like my uncle said, my uncle said I need
Yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay
I wish I could yodel like my Uncle Sid
He's a yodeler of some renown
I wish I could yodel like my Uncle Sid
Champion of Canning Town
He's got a medal or two for his yodel-o-do
One for his yodel-o-dee
I wish I could yodel like my Uncle Sid
My Uncle Sid and me
Yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay
I wish I could yodel like my uncle said
I yodel all day long
I wish I could yodel like my uncle said
I yodel every song
Old man river needs a mother brown
Even God save the queen
I wish I could yodel like my uncle said
My uncle said ney
