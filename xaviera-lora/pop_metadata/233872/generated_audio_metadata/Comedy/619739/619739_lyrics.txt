You get up every morning with your nasty breath
Scratch your balls and comb your chest
You grunt and groan and pass on gas
You could make a monkey laugh
You spend the freakin' day in your underwear
Your aspirin's burned into my easy chair
You put on fifty pounds and you lost your hair
And I hate you
I hate you
Everything you say
And everything you do
I hate you
I hate you
I really, really do
Yes, I do
I hate you
I really, really do
I really do
I really, really do
I really do
I really, really, really, really do
