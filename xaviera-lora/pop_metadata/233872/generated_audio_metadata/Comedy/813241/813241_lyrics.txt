Everybody wants to dance the tango
Leave work early anytime you can go
It's a dance in praise everyone these days
Every girl can learn to dance the tango
Meet a tango Joe with a look and bow
On the dancing floor you can dance some more
Dancing up an appetite then let's go out and grab a bite
Any time is fine to dance the tango
Even on the beach behind the mangroves
It's a dance in craze, everyone these days
Tango morning, noon and night
Then you'll learn to do it right, that's right
