I am Victor, the wire walking man
I am walk the wires like no one else's can
I do not scare so easy
Even heights don't make me queasy
I am Victor, the wire walking man
And I fear no height
So long as rope is tight
If rope not tight I know I bet I bounce tonight from safety net
We don't want bouncing, we want balancing
Here here let me show you, introduce you to my sister Victoria
I am Victoria, I ride the bike with Victor
I think he's lucky to have me for a sister
Maybe crazy, but I like to ride on shoulders while I'm biking all the time
On a tightrope up so high
And we fear no height
So long as rope is tight
If rope not tight I know I bet
I bounce tonight from safety net
Like I said before
We don't want bouncing
We want balancing
Ha! You think easy being way up there?
I tell you, riding two wheel bicycle is no joke
Even on the ground
Look, I show you something really special
I will show you now what jumping rope is like
I think sometimes it is worse than riding bike
It's not easy I have found
It's hard enough while on the ground
But I choose high wire because it is my life
And I fear no heights, no heights
So long as rope is tight
If rope not tight, I know I bet
I bounce tonight from safety net
Come Victoria, help me sing it one more time
And we fear no height
So long as rope is tight
If rope not tight, I know I bet
I bounce tonight from safety net
So long from high wire
So long
