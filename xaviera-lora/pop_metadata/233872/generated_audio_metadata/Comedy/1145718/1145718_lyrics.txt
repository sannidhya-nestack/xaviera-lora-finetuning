Let me into the house, my love
To hear the fluorescent songs above
TVs in every room
Naps in the afternoon
So many ways to care for me
Promise that you'll be there to be my sanatorium
Laughter in every hall
Fluffy pillows on every wall
Wander the days away
Let's break out the cards and games
Carried along in chairs with wheels
A handful of pills with every meal
Would you be my sanatorium
Put a glazed look in my eyes
Be the place to go when I get glum
Happy music fills the sky
Be my sanatorium
Scooby-dooby-doo, ba-da-dum
Scooby-dooby-doo, ba-da-dum
Shiny cocoons of tile and steel
Another handful of pills and I'll be healed
Crayons and paper dolls
Let's take a stroll up and down the halls
Angels of mercy dressed in white
Put me to bed and lock me tight
Would you be my sanatorium
It's the end of a deep despair
Would you make my every thought go numb
I need your love and intensive care
Be my sanatorium
Be my sanatorium
Be my sanatorium
Be my sanatorium
