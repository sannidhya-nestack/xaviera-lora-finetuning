Standby camera one
Standby all cues
Take camera one
We interrupt this program for a special announcement
Come on everybody, grab a beer and gather'round
Stand up the volume and set your thinking down
Never need to worry'cause we never tell a lie
Truth is how we sell it and we sell it'til you buy
Come on everybody (drink up, drink up)
Welcome to the party (get down, get down)
Come on everybody (get real, get real)
Knowledge is power and power is wisdom
Sport and competition and it's only television
Drugs are always legal, standard issue, FDA
Turn on depression, get your miracle today
If it isn't working, we got something you can add
If that doesn't do it, then we know you're really bad
Come on everybody (Drink up, drink up)
Welcome to the party (get down, get down)
Come on everybody (get ready, get ready)
We want advertisers and we want your subscription
The human condition is only television
Gone are the days of open air waves
You have to pay
And if you complain, well quite frankly you're insane
Politicians know that they are larger on the screen
Pay to pay attention, there's a good chance you agree
Bite size and feeling while we feed you every lie
Truth is how we sell it'cause we know you're hungry guys
Come on everybody
Welcome to the party, get down, get down
Come on everybody, get free, get free
Knowledge is what we say and what we say is wisdom
Confusion is the best of the human condition
If that doesn't do it there is always litigation
You're a nation in division and it's only television
Come on everybody, it's only television
Come on everybody
It's only television
Come on everybody
It's only television
Come on everybody
It's only television
Come on everybody
It's only television
Come on everybody
It's only television
Come on everybody
It's only television
