I wonder, wonder what I could do
To win approval from all of you
And be deeply loved forever more
And not have to buy anything at the store
I know
I wanna look like Gwyneth Paltrow
I wonder, oh I wonder what I could do
I hear she does lots of yoga
I'll do lots of yoga too
Every Monday, Wednesday, Friday I do yoga faithfully
After one whole year it's time to take another look at me
No, I still don't look like Gwyneth Paltrow
What's up with that? I did all the work
There must be a flaw in my thinking somewhere
And that flaw really hurts
What's true? Yoga makes me feel alive
Yoga improves my muscle tone
When I'm breathing doing yoga
I am in my body and completely at home
I'll never look like Gwyneth Paltrow
That was perfectionistic fantasy
But here's the truth about Gwyneth Paltrow
She doesn't get to look like me
