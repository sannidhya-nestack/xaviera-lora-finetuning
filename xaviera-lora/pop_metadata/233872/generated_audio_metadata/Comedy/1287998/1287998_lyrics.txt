It's funny how it came about
While he was trying to play it out
His hips were moving more each day
Then his hands got in the way
The crowd got loud and begged for more
It kept him dancing on the floor
Your truck dance is going strong
Just close your fists and rock along
Kinda bend your knees with ease and see how many people it will please
He feels so happy when all is well let's just hope he'll never fail
Wants his people all around
Feels ten feet tall and off the ground
We'll see more dancing come around
Since Donald Trump is here in town
The Trump dance is going strong
Just close your fists and rock along
Kinda bend your knees with ease
Then see how many people you will please
The next four years can pass by soon
So let's start dancing to a tune
You are shy, no need to cry
Anyone can dance with this kind of guy
Let it loose with what you've learned
You long neck goose, it's now your turn
The club dance is going strong (going strong)
Just close your fists and rock along (rock along)
Gotta bend your knees with ease
Let's see how many people you will please
Yeah, see how many people it will please
Whoa, whoa
