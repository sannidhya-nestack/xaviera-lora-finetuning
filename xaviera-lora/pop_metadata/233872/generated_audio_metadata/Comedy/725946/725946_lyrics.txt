Succulent blue was a bag by the beatnik
He wore a blue suit suit underneath his blue thong
But when old blue tried to masticate while performing at a Fresno date
It made him hurl in the middle of a song
Chewy crusty love looks like blue blew it
Pinto pork fly blue blew it
Blue's wife Wanda was a disco blonde
She and Flapjack the chef was foolin' around
But when Flap whacked her with his spatula
Poor old Blue became a bachelor
Now Wanda's dancing six feet on the ground
Chewy crust now looks like Blue blew it
A pinch of pork blah, Blue blew it
All the old satchel-headed toadstool in Dino's bunk
Left poor old Blue in a deep blue funk
Toothy crust time
Looks like Blue blew it
Pinto pork blob
Yeah, Blue blew it
Blue, blue it
Blue, blue it
Blue, blue it
Blue, blue it
Blue, blue it
