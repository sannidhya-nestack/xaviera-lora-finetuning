Well I work all day and I work all night
Cause that's just what I do
I'm a slave to the IRS and you can't be one too
Get up early and work all day and then I stay up late
I never thought I'd find myself working for the state
Don't take my money don't take my time no no
Cause we're not gonna take it no more
No more
Well, I'm certified and I'm hypnotized and I'm living the American dream
My money's tight but that's alright'cause I'm on the winning team
It's understood that the dollar's good and the Fed has got my back
But then I found out the Fed was fake and that we'd all been jacked
Don't take my money, don't take my time, no, no
we're not gonna take it no more
No more
So now I know what has taken place
An economic war against the human race
They take your money, they take mine too
Enslavement of a nation, it comes down to me or you
No law was ever written, no law was put in place
Like the IRS could tax us on a man's working wage
But don't you worry, the time is close
The IRS is finished when the people finally vote
Don't take my money, don't take my time no more
we're not gonna take it no more
No more, not gonna take it no more
No more, not gonna take it no more
No more, not gonna take it no more
No more, don't take my money, don't take my time, no more
we're not gonna take it no more
No more, not gonna take it no more, no more
