I was on the way to see you, I was on the road
I was gonna park my little car beneath your window
When I got to town I had to keep the car in drive
there ain't no parking on the even side
I crept around the corner and I drove around the block
Tried to bribe your neighbor into giving up his own spot
But I soon discovered there are some things you can't buy
When there ain't no parking on the even side
Ain't no parking on the
Ain't no parking on the
Ain't no parking on the
Even side
Now there's a fire hydrant in the only space I saw
That would be illegal and I will not break the law
I called you from my cell phone right before the damn thing died
Said there ain't no parking on the even side
Ain't no parking
Ain't no parking
Ain't no parking
On this even side
I found a row of meters
But I did not find the time
Gonna take your quarters
But they will not take a thin dime
Take my empty pockets
See you sometime, at least I'll try
there ain't no parking
On this even side
Ain't no parking
Ain't no parking on the even side
Ain't no parking on the even side
