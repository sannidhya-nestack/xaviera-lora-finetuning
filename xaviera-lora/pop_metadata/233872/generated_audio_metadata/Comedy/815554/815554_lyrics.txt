I know you will be happy in Manhattan
That uptown living's gonna suit you fine
I guess you'll be taking all our high prize knickknacks
But I ain't gonna let you take what's mine
You can't have my velvet Elvis
And don't you take my day-glow lava lamp
I'll just keep that beat up pawn shop guitar
And my limited edition Hank Williams stamps
I'll leave the picture of them dogs playing poker
And that ashtray in the shape of Tennessee
You can't have my velvet Elvis
And you can't take the country out of me
I won't be joining you in New York City
My country ways are something that won't outgrow
One last kiss is all you'll get to remember me
So don't be sneaking off with my momentos
You can't have my Velvet Elvis
And don't you take my Dayglow Lover lamp
I'll just keep that beat up poncho guitar
And my limited edition Hank Williams stamps
I'll leave the picture of them dogs playing poker
And that ashtray in the shape of Tennessee
You can't have my velvet Elvis
And you can't take the country out of me
You can't have my velvet Elvis
And you can't take the country out of me
