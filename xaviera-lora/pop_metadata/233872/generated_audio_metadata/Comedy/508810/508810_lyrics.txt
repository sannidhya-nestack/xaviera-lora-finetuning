On a Saturday night in'71
We'd head into town to have some fun
Bow to your partner, bow to your corner
Swing your honey and circle left
Girls wore petticoats of soft anza
Boys were ready to play bonanza
Almond lip with your right hand
Dosey doe and promenade
With your sweet little honey in red and gold
There was such good reason her hand to hold
For ladies chain across that ring
Meet your partner, let's all swing
Builder dead, gonna call the square
For the dances and Saturday fancy wear
Centers pass through, swing that lady
Right hand star and turn it round
They'll dance till nine and take a break
For coffee and sandwiches and homemade cake
Step two away, boy, run around the girl
Give her a swing, then Ferris wheel
But the teens can't wait to go outside
For kisses in the darkness where they hide
Swing your corner back right out
Or spin the top and boys move up
Every week you'll see Dave Barry
Looking for a girl that he can marry
He went for years'til out of the blue
One little girl made his dream come true
Farmer Hank lost his wife Anne
To the dancing charms of another man
Bow to your partner, bow to your coroner
Soon he hitched with Pretty Lorna

Swing your honey and circle left
Girls wore petticoats of soft anza
Boys were ready to play bonanza
Alleman lift with your right hand
Dosido and promenade
With your sweet little honey in red and gold
There was such good reason her hand to hold
For a lady's chain across that ring
Meet your partner, let's all swing
Alleman lift with your right hand
Dosido and promenade
Bow to your partner, bow to your coroner
Thank you, good night
