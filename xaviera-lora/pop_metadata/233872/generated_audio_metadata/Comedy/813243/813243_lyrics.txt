Lord I know that I've been drinking
This ain't no time to say a prayer
But Lord you just gotta tell me
Ain't that an angel sitting there
You don't owe me any favors
But I'm asking anyway
Do you mind if I walk over
When the band begins to play
I never danced with an angel
You'll have to tell me what to do
But if you show me how to hold her
This is what I promise you
I'll keep my hands off her halo
I won't squeeze her wings
You'll have to trust me not to touch
All her other angel things
You probably need her back in heaven
I guess I'll have to let her go
Besides I would look so foolish
Stepping on her angel toes
So go ahead Lord and take her
You all can leave me behind
Wait a minute Lord she's smiling
et that last part never mind
I never danced with an angel
You'll have to tell me what to do
But if you show me how to hold her
This is what I promise you
I'll keep my hands off her halo
I won't squeeze her wings
You'll have to trust me not to touch
All her other angel things
I'll keep my hands off her halo
I won't squeeze her wings
You'll have to trust me not to touch
All her other angel things
Good Lord
