Looking at the old bits, I came across a crook
Chopinska was the kind at whom the judge could throw the book
Two hundred times arrested, sixteen years not concurrent
I found this fascinating, wouldn't sing it if it weren't
During the Great Depression, to help his family
Young Joe stole peanut butter and other groceries
He grew more proficient, moved on to bigger things
He heisted furs and typewriters and also diamond rings
His crime career spent forty years, so the story's told
A bullet-ridden burglar with a heart of gold
In wintery old Chicago he stole a Cadillac
With a Spaniel in the backseat, so he brought that doggy back
It's the Pops Panschko Polka and he's safe he would crack it
The Pops Panschko Polka a pistol he would pack it
The Pops Panschko Polka he'd walk off with your jacket
Said all my life I stole things that's my racket
Panchco's brother, Peanuts, was not the best of men
He ratted on poor Joseph, Joe got four years in the pen
Why he gave up his brother, I do not understand
Except his relocation and the Fed protection plan
Joe could open car trunks by giving them a whack
One time he stole his lawyer's files and didn't bring'em back
His last police encounter was just two years ago
When burglars busted into his north side bungalow
His family wouldn't fess up about how and when he died
I'm sure a mob of people paid their respects and cried
Folks from the old neighborhood lined up around the block
To see if Joseph Panchko would pick the coffin lock
It's the Pops Panschofolka and he's safe he would crack it
The Pops Panschofolka a pistol he would pack it
The Pops Panschofolka he'd walk off with your jacket
He said all my life I stole things that's my racket
Chicago's best known felon, the Polish Robin Hood
Was buried on the north side, his case was closed for good
From heaven's gate he'd tell us, don't wallow in your grief
I'm through with crime, my feet are tired, hey I was just a thief
It's the Pops Pancho Polka and he's safe he would rack it
The Pops Pancho Polka a pistol he would pack it
The Pops Pancho Polka he'd walk off with your jacket
He said all my life I stole things that's my racket
It's the Pops Pancho Polka
