I stand two foot three, I weigh twenty-nine pounds
My teeth are yellow and my eyes are brown
Got a four inch nose sticking out of my face
And if you're looking for trouble, well you've come to the right place
Cause I'm an American Dog, D-A-W-G
American Dog, ooh
Well, I'm a man's best friend, so you better not mess with me, American Doll
I was born in an alley in the freezing cold
My mama left me when I was six weeks old
My daddy was a drifter'til he ran out of luck
Had a difference of opinion with a Chevrolet truck
And I'm an American dog, D-A-W-G
American dog, ooh, ooh
Well, I'm a man's best friend, though you better not mess with me
American dog, oh yeah
American doll
American doll
American doll
The neighborhood ladies, they know what I got
My nose may be cold, but my blood is hot
Don't put me on a leash, I don't like to be confined
I'm the seventh son in a litter of night
And I'm American Dog, D-A-W-G, American Dog
Well, I'm a man's best friend, so you better not mess with me
American dog (yeah)
American dog
American dog
American Dog
You better feed me good
You better treat me right
Or I'll pee on your rug
And I'll bark all night
I'm an American Dog
That's just the way I am
Don't give me none of that dry food
I like the stuff in the can, yeah
I'm an American dog
D-A-W-G American dog
Ooh, ooh
Well, I'm a man's best friend
So you better not mess with me
American dog, no, no, no
I'm an American dog
D-A-W-G American dog
I'm a man's best friend so you better not mess with me
