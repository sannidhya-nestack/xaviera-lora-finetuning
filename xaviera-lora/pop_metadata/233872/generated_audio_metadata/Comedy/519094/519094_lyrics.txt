Too cool for school, I'm just the latest thing
A revolutionary medicine

Too cool for school, I'm just the latest craze

Just taste my coffee and you'll soon see why
I take plastic, I take cash
But with my system you make it all back

Cause I'm too cool for school you know it could be you

My latest connection runs like a dream
Download this album at a super high speed
