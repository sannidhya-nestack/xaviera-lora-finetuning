Well it happened right here several million years ago
That two continents collided with the big people
They pushed and they shoved with a powerful motion
Till the mountains rose up out of the big blue ocean
Appalachia rappin' at your mountain rap
Appalachia rappin' at your mountain rap
A few million years later, the Indians appeared
Then DeSoto came along and he did something kinda weird
In Florida, he met the Appalachicola tribe
So he told the mapmaker, "Go ahead and inscribe"
So they put the name down, but by then it was too late
Appalachian ain't for those who never left the sunny state
Appalachian rappin' at your mountain rap
Now as far as we can tell they're the oldest things we've seen
So pay tribute to these mountains if you know what I mean
Smokies, Blue Ridge, Shenandoah, Allegheny
Catskills, Greensland, Berkshires and there's even more to see
Adirondacks and the Poconos, the Whites and Tumane
These are all the mountains in the Appalachian chain
Appalachia rappin' at your mountain rap
Appalachia rappin' at your mountain rap
Appalachia rappin' at your mountain rap
Appalachia rappin' at your mountain rap
Blue Ridge, Blue Ridge Mountains
Blue Ridge, Blue Ridge Mountains
Blue Ridge, Blue Ridge Mountains
Appalachia rappin' at your mountain raps
