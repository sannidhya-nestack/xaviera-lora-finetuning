Well me and my girl got in a terrible quarrel when she fell in the toilet one day
Cause I didn't lower the seat after doing my business in the usual way
Well I got to thinking about all that she said about how selfish and foolish was I
I knew then and there that the only repair was to pack up and tell her goodbye
I told her you deserve a lot better than me
The kind of a guy who sits down when he pees
The kind of a life where you never have to lower the seat
Lower the seat
Well all my drinking buddies tell me sit down on the loo
It's the only polite way to be
But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
So I stand up tall proud and free
So darling you deserve a lot better than me
The kind of a guy who sits down when he pees
The kind of a life where you never have to lower the C
Better than me
You deserve a man whose thoughts are far between and few
You deserve the kind of guy who deserves a girl like you
You deserve a lot better than me
The kind of a guy who sits down when you peeze
The kind of a life where you never have to lower the seed
I said the kind of a life where you never have to lower the seed
I said the kind of a life where you never have to lower the seed
Better than me
