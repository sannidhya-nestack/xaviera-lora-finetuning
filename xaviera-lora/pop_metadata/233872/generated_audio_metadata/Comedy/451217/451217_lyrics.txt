The music business is a cruel and shallow money trench
A long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free
And good men die like dogs, there's also a negative side
No one exactly said that, but if they did they wouldn't have lied
Whoever commits suicide is totally justified
Now I'm not saying playing live ain't a lot of fun
Except driving home a hundred miles on Highway 101
a bartender loved you so she brought you lots of drinks
And you hope a cop don't stop you and tell you what he thinks
Now it's not exactly pay-to-play, it's just called ticket presales
You bought a hundred from the club, you hope you'll get some resales
You've been spare-changing since noon, but there's not enough for dinner yet
And the fans love your music, they all burned it off the internet
Will you humor me a little bit, just a little while?
Go ahead and snicker, go ahead and smile
my freestyle's gonna be mighty vile
I'm just another cat who thinks he can'cause he went and saw 8 Mile
I've ripped off Chuck Berry and Robert Johnson's blues
I've ripped off B .B. King and Jimi Hendrix too
I even rip off Jesus when I say, "What would Jesus do?"
And if I like your shit, I'll probably rip off you too
'Cause I'm just a country boy who came to Hollywood
To learn the music business and do the things I should
So I can pay the whiskey to play down on the strip
And pray they don't tell me I'm totally unhip
Whoops, just kidding, I bet you couldn't guess
You see, the music business is one big fuckin' mess
The A &R's are idiots who usually oppress
Each new hopeful sucker they send into distress
So a month or two goes by and you burn off your illusions
And you're wondering how you're gonna pay the rent
Cause your childhood in Hollywood is suffering intrusions
And you haven't made a single lousy cent
So you're swearing that tomorrow you'll be getting up early
And you won't quit till you find yourself a gig
Telling everyone you meet that you had a couple lessons
From the guy who used to be in Mr. Big
And nobody's impressed but they smile and nod yes
And tell you that they like your new tattoo
And they play along well'cause they never will confess
They were hoping they could get a gig from you
Got your demo in your pocket everywhere you go
you never know just who you're gonna meet
I met a hoe named Jo, looked like Marilyn Monroe
Said that she was living on the street
I took her to the Sky Bar but they wouldn't let us in
So we had to settle for the Rainbow Room
She ordered something triple
I ordered up two aspirin when the jukebox started playing warrant tunes
She said her trade was skin and she started with Rin Tin Tin
Then she popped a Vicodin and said where do we begin?
So I ordered Gordon's gin and chased it with a Heineken
And listened to her story of the things it might have been
She said, "I might as well tell you I'm a millionaireess
Perhaps you know my sister, her name is Paris
She wants to be like me, so she makes movies too
We're looking for a costar, perhaps it could be you"
I told her not right now, not in my condition
Even though I desperately need money for tuition
She said shut up, let's go, you're having your audition
This time tomorrow night you'll be on Inside Edition
Funny how things work out, fate's little twists and turns
One day you're eating ramen, the next day life upturns
But I'll tell you all a secret, I always knew it would
I love the music business, hooray for Hollywood
Hooray for Hollywood! Hooray for Hollywood! Hooray for Hollywood! Hooray for Hollywood!
