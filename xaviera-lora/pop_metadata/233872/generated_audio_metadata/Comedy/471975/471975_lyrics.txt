Every summer breeze that blows
Starts a tender burning nose
Dripping like a garden hose in June
Swollen eyelids block the sun
Mucus membranes weigh a ton
Mother Nature's just having fun with you
Dear God
Allergy, allergy
They make you cough and make you sneeze
Every little summer breeze brings allergy
Scratchy throat and aching jaw
Blazing nostrils cracked and raw
You're wheezing like a power saw, aren't you?
Kleenex wads around your bed
Hockey players in your head
Dinner tastes like Wonder Bread and glue
You got allergies, allergies
They make you cough and make you sneeze
And every little summer breeze brings allergies
Muscles aching, stay inside and take the suit off bed
Close the windows, use your nasal spray, take your vitamins
Give the cat away, buy a gas mask, do a headstand, sell the house and move to Iceland on your blistered lips
So slather on the Vaseline
And pop those antihistamines
Your nose looks like a nectarine
But there's nothing you can do, you
Allergies, allergies
Don't drink milk and don't eat cheese
Girls, every little summer brings
Allergies, allergies
Won't somebody help me with it
Allergies, allergies
Held beneath the cottonwood tree
Oh, every little summer breeze brings the energy
Won't somebody save me from these allergies
