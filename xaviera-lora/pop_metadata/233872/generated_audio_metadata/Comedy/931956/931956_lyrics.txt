Oh man, what did I do with that thing?
It was right here!
What did I do with it?
I gotta find that thing, I gotta get out of here man!
What did I do with that thing?
You know, little thing, little thing!
What did I do with it?
What did I do with that thing?
What did I do with that little thing?
What did I do with that thing?
What did I do with that thing?
What did I do with that little thing?
What did I do with that thing?
What did I do with that thing?
What did I do with that little thing?
What did I do with that thing?
What did I do with that thing?
What did I do with that little thing?
What did I do with that thing?
Somehow I must have lost it
That little thing
I thought I put it on the table
Now to find it I am unable
I usually put it in my pocket
Now I think I must have lost it
It really can't be very far
Perhaps I left it in the car
Really like its shape and color
I know I'll never find another
That little thing
What did I do with that thing?
What did I do with that little thing?
What did I do with that thing?
What did I do with that thing?
What did I do with that little thing?
What did I do with that thing?
What did I do with that thing?
What did I do with that little thing?
What did I do with that thing?
What did I do with that thing?
What did I do with that thing?
What did I do with that thing?
What did I do with that thing?
Oh, here it is.
