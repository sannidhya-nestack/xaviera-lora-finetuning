Called you last night at four in the morning
You didn't answer but I can't really blame you
Jessica Thompson I like you but I'm afraid to show it
So I guess I'll have to keep stalking you on Facebook
I know it's kinda crazy and even a little weird
The only time I got the balls to call you's after I slammed a case of beer
I need it darling, I need you to let me be that fuckin' guy who calls you when I'm drunk and high
It's been so many years now
She's a good dancing hotline
But I'm afraid to show it, yeah
So I guess I'll just have to keep stalking you on Facebook, yeah
Though I say without a say, "Hey, bitch, are you pregnant?"
I know that bad attention's better than no attention at all
