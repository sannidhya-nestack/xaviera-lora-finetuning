I took off across the dance floor flying high
Love was in my radar and the girls were in my sights
My mood hit a tailspin when they all turned around
I saw my old girlfriends aiming to shoot me down
Look out boys I'm going down in old flames
Surrounded by unfriendly fire
They're wise to my maneuvers, they've got a battle plan
So long boys, I'm going down in old flames
Mayday mayday, they're all giving me flack
With incoming insults, no ammo too far back
My pride's full of holes, it's a hopeless situation
Guys you'll have to cruise in missing man formation
Look out boys I'm going down in old flames
Surrounded by unfriendly fire
They're wise to my maneuvers
They've got a battle plan
So long boys
I'm going down in old flames
Well a legend dies tonight
So when you're able
Put a plaque on this table
That says this is the place where we lost the ace
They're wise to my maneuvers
They've got a battle plan
So long boys
I'm going down in old flames
So long boys I'm going down in old flames
Surrounded by unfriendly fire
They're wise to my maneuvers
They've got a battle plan
Remember me
I'm going down in old flames
I'm a dead man going down in old flames
Hey bartender is there a back door in this place
Cause look man I gotta bail out you know what I mean
Look out below boys I'm coming down
Oh man they're gonna burn me I know they are
