I eat what I want, I drink what I want
I wear what I want, I think what I want
I'm ready to roll, God's been controlled
I'm a bowler, I dress like a slob
I drink on the job, I might be a blob
But I sure ain't a snob
I don't dress to impress, I couldn't care less
I'm a bowler, all my neighbors go to the gym
Where they can work out and sweat
That's too much pain, so I sit at the lanes with a drink and a cigarette
I say what I want, I do what I want, I look how I want
I'll eat a croissant with a strike or a spare, I really could care
I'm a bowler
I hit the buffet, then I'm ready to play
I couldn't care less what the others may say
I'm ready to bowl, I'm chewing my skull
I'm a bowler
I eat what I want, I drink what I want
I wear what I want, I think what I want
I'm ready to roll, I got spin control
I'm a bowler
I'm a bowler
I'm a bowler
I'm a bowler
