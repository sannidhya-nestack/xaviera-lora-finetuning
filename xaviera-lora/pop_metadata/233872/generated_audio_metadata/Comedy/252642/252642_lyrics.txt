There was a roach named Billy and a roach named Sue
And they found a perfect home just made for two
It was Styrofoam, oh Styrofoam
And they moved right in, one, two, three
And started their cockroach family
And the kids came along, there were boys and girls
And the little roaches asked if the whole world was always styrofoam
Whoa, styrofoam
Mama started the tales from Grandpa's days
Said you're right, it wasn't always this way
And they used to have things called buildings
And the humans had something called a house
And it'll shock you all to hear this
They used to gas us to move us out
And the little roaches shivered but Mama just smirked
The humans tried but it didn't work
But they made Styrofoam, oh my kind of home
Now the humans have things that they call brains
And how they worked I could never explain
See they needed clean air for breathing
And clean water to keep'em alive
And if you want the truth of what happened
They all committed suicide
Now you can rest easy'cause they're no longer around
To try out their poison and hunt us down
We're safe in styrofoam, whoa, styrofoam
And tomorrow we'll see if we can find some
Good old plastic for a brand new slide
Oh Styrofoam
Oh yeah Styrofoam
Oh Styrofoam
Oh Styrofoam
Yes, Styrofoam
