Be nice to the sound guy
Better make him your best friend
You are in his hands
He can start you up or he can be your end
Be good to the sound guy
He'll mix you and compress you too
Let him be in control, let him have his way with you
Don't touch his cables
Keep your hands off his EQ
Don't push his sliders up and down
Let him take care of you
Be sweet to the sound guy
And honey, remember this
He can turn you off or he can turn you on, uh huh
He can turn you off or he can turn you on, you got it baby
He can turn you off or he can turn you on, ooh yeah
