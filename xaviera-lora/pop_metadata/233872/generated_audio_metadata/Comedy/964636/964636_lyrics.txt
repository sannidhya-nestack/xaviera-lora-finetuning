When everything should come in alright but it always turns out so bad
When your one true lover seems right but then she's really a drag
Then you're at your job and your boss says you're gonna get fired
That's why you really feel tired
When you get into your car and then you get a flat tire
Insurance says you gotta pay up or else you're gonna expire
Turning on the news they say here's to Armack and Meyer
It's time to pack your bags
Take me to your legal leader
I'm looking for some new adventure
I wandered here throughout my travels
I finally got something to look for
When everything's a barnacle and you're being scraped on the floor
And the bill collector he calls and says you need to pay more
When the neighbors bangin' their heads on your paper thin walls
That's when you get a bad headache
Get a glass of milk from the fridge and you find that it's spoiled
Argue with the wife and it's done she finally shows you the door
Trying to buy a drink at the bar, but you're all out of bread.
It's time to take a trip
Take me to your legal leader
I'm looking for some new adventure
I've wandered here throughout my travels
I finally got something to look for
Take me to your legal leader
I'm looking for some new adventure
I've come to stay here in my travels
I finally got something to live for
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
