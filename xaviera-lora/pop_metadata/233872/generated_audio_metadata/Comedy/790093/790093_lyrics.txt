Everything thing thing will be all wrong wrong wrong
It doesn't matter if you're weak or strong
So just relax and sing along
Knowing everything will be all wrong
The cream will curdle
The credo will fall
The crops will wither
The car will stall
But don't you worry
No, don't be sad
I'm sure that everything will turn out bad
Everything, thing, thing will be all wrong, wrong, wrong
It doesn't matter if you're weak or strong
So just relax and sing along
No, and everything will be all wrong
Your boss's pink slip says you're through
And then the bank forecloses on you
And the dough you saved for a rainy day
The rain came down and washed it all away
everything, thing, thing will be all wrong, wrong, wrong
It doesn't matter if you're weak or strong
So just relax and sing along
Know when everything will be alright
Your wife will run off with another guy
And your best friend will cheat you blind
But your luck will change, so don't you cry
You'll hit the lottery the day you die
everything, thing, thing will be all wrong, wrong, wrong
It doesn't matter if you're weak or strong
So just relax and sing along
Knowing everything will be all wrong
You'll see Saint Peter at the pearly gates
As the angels take you to your rightful place
But then Saint Paul says there's been a mistake
I'm afraid you're headed down the other way
'Cause everything, thing, thing will be all wrong, wrong, wrong
It doesn't matter if you're weak or strong
So just relax and sing along
Knowing everything will be all wrong
Knowing everything will be all wrong
