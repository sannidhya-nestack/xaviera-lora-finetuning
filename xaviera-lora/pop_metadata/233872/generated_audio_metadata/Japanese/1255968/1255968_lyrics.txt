Under the Tokyo sky, two hearts ignite
Wave to me on a mesmerizing sight
In your eyes I see all the stars align
In your arms everything just feels right
Across the city escape beneath the Sakura flow
Our hearts dance in rhythm in the city's echo
With each shared secret our affections grow
In the heart of Tokyo where caught in love's glow
Walking through the streets hand in hand
In the hustle yet in the dreamland
Beneath the city lights, on the skyline sand
We have etched our stories time had planned
In this urban maze our melody plays
Lost in the rhythm of Japan's embrace
With the stars witnessing our love's chase
In Tokyo's canvas, we've made our love's face
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Beneath the Tokyo moon
Our story unfolds
A tale of love as time beholds
In this city of dreams as the night unfolds
Our hearts whisper a melody in the Tokyo hall
Across the city is fake beneath the Sakura flow
Our hearts dance in rhythm
In the city's red cold
With each shed secret
Our affections grow
In the heart of Tokyo
Where caught in love's glow
