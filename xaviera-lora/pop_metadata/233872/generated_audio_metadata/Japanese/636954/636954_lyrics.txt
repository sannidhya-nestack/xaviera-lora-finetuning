Dear father, mother, how are you?
お元気ですか?
I have been finally the help
Of the new friends I have made
We have been so far apart
I miss you with all my heart
But my gratitude is beyond the distance, arigato
All the things that you taught me
When I was just a girl
Now it's all coming back to me
And it guides me everyday
Be polite, I say thank you
Say I'm sorry when I'm wrong
Never envy what I lack
Be the lady that I am
Now that I know loneliness
I recall all your affection
Though I know I can't return to Tokyo
I must go on
When I think of those good things
We had such a short time
I should say that I'm sorry
If I called you any shame
Swinging after a bath soda
Creamy air, I feel it here and now
We will be fine, we will be fine
I like kisekaedousu, eating sweets before my meals
I'm still dancing all the time, never see me winning looks
I feel very shy sometimes, don't know how to ask for help
I need her to speak my mind, maybe something never change
I have so much love to give
I won't fear to show my heart
I am hoping for the day
Someone special's in my life
When I see the sakura
I'll remember mom and dad
Petters to sing in the breeze
I will never be alone
Swinging up from above
Soda
Creamy air
I feel it here
We will be fine, we will be fine
