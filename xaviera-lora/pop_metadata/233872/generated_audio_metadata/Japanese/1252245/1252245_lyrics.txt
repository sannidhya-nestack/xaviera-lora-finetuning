In the city's middle globe
Where dreams run wild and free
I found you by the riverside
Under the cherry trees
Your smile was like a melody
A song I long to sing
Together we will write the notes that our hearts tickling
Wandering through crowded streets your hand in mine
We keep the beat we spread stories in the dark
Love's sweet symphony we embark on this journey through the night
Holding on with all our might in this city's rhythm we find
A love that's purely divine
In the city's neon glow
Where dreams run wild and free
I found you by the riverside
Under the cherry trees
Your smile is like a melody
A song I long to sing
Together we will write the notes
Let our hearts take wing
Wandering through the streets
Your hand in mine we keep the beat
This best story's in the dark, the sweet symphony
We embark on this journey through the night
Holding on with all our might, in the city's rhythm we find
Holding on, keep holding, the thought that's purely divine
Holding on, keep holding, the love that's purely divine
Holding on, keep holding, the thought that's purely divine
Holding on, keep holding, the love that's purely divine
A love that's partly confined
