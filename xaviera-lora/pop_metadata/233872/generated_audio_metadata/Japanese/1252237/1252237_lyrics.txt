In a near-on city where dreams tick-tock
Your smile cuts through the darkest night
Electric pulses, lights, blinding bright
In this rhythm, hearts in it glide
Walk with me through
Sibuya streets where crowded faces
In the daylight meet
I love the journey, endless and sweet
Through every challenge, together we defeat
Dreams of tomorrow in our hands we hold
Our future together, stories unfold
In every heartbeat, every breath we take
This is our last song with no mistake
Dreams of tomorrow in our hands we hold
Our future together, stories unfold
In every heartbeat, every breath we take
This is our love song, make no mistake
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
In my neon city
Where dreams take flight, you smile
Welcome to the darkest night
Electric pulses, lights blinding bright
In the neon city where dreams take flight
Your smile cuts through the darkness night
Electric pulses, lights blinding bright
In this rhythm hearts ignite
Walk with me
You should go your way
So proud of the faces
In the daylight they're dying
Woo, all of the day
Endlessly, through every try
Together we can be the change of tomorrow
In our hands we hold the future together
Stories unfold in every heartbeat
Every breath we take this is our love song
We'll make no mistake
