Beneath the sakura tree, I see your face so clear
Memories of our love keep pulling me near
Your voice is my melody, soothing my mind
In this crazy world, you're one of a kind
Seasons may change, but my love stays true
Like the endless ocean, deep and blue
Hold me close and tight, whisper it in my ear
With you, my darling, there's nothing to fear
Beneath the sakura tree, I see your face so clear
Memories of our love, keep pulling me near
Your voice is my melody, soothing my mind
In this crazy world, you're one of a kind
Seasons may change, but my love stays true
Light the endless ocean deep in blue
Hold me close and tight, whisper in my ear
With you my darling, there's nothing to fear
Hold me close and tight, whisper in my ear
With you my darling, there's nothing to fear
