Lay my aim at Shibuya, our laughter echoes loud
Dreams painted on the skyline, touching every cloud
Moments filled with wonder, dreams all coming true
With every step we take, I'm falling more for you
Life is an adventure, with you by my side
Through every twist and turn, there's nothing to hide
Together we'll explore the beauty of this land
Just you and me forever, walking hand in hand
Late night in Shibuya
Our laughter echoes loud
Dreams painted on the skyline
Touching every cloud
Moments I would wonder, dreams all coming true
With every step we take, I'm falling more for you
Life is an adventure when you're by my side
Through every twist and turn there's nothing to hide
Together we'll restore the beauty of this land
Just you and me forever walking hand in hand
Ha, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Life is an adventure, we can pull aside
Through every twist and turn, there's nothing to hide
Together we'll explore the beauty of this land
Just you and me forever, walking hand in hand
Hand in hand
Walking hand in hand in hand
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Wainaina shibuya, our laughter echoes loud
Dreams painted on the skyline, touching every cloud
