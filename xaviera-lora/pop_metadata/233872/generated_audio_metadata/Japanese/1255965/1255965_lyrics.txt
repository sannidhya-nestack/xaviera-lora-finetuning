In our magical world where the sun always shines
We laugh and play and sing in line
Landing under the sky
Feeling so free
In our sweet land of Jacob
As happy as can be
Jacob, Jacob
We're singing, dance
In our land of dreams
We drink the gems
We clap, we cheer, we delight every day
In our world, in this fold, J-pop loves in every sway
Sharing candies and stories in the warm sun glow
In the land of J-pop, friendships grow
J-pop, J-pop, full of song
In a land of joy we all belong
So come, let's sing our song so sweet
In our J-pop land where happy hearts sleep
