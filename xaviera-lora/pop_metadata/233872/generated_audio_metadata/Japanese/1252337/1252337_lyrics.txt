Upon the ocean breeze and this memory sea
Setting our heart at ease
Whispering through the trees
Journey through the night
Stars burning bright
Holding each other tight
Till the morning light
Waves dance along
In a melody song
Where we belong all night long
Through the ebb and flow, stars will glow
Guiding us slow, love's gentle show
In your tender eyes, beneath the tranquil skies
No goodbyes, just endless highs
As the dawn will break, together we take
Every step we make, love's gentle way
Upon the ocean's breeze
Live, love, sleep, reprise
Hearts unfreeze in the moonsot seas
Yearning through the night
Stars burning bright
Holding each other tight
Till the morning light
The rays dance alone
In the moonlight, yes, oh
Where we belong
All night long
Through the air, then flow
Stars will glow
Guiding us slow
Love's gentle show
In your tender eyes
Beneath the tranquil skies
Know goodbyes
Just endless highs
As endless highs
As the dawn will break
Together we take
Every step we make
Love's gentle way
Upon the ocean's breeze
Live love sweet reprise
Hearts unfreeze in the moon soft seas
