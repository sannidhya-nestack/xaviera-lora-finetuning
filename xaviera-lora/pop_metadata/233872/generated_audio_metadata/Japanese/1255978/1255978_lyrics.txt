In our magical world where the sun always shines
We laugh and play and sing in lines
Running under the sky feeling so free
In our sweet land of J-pop as happy as can be
J-pop, J-pop, we sing and dance
In our land of dreams we take the chance
We clap, we cheer, we delight every day
In our beautiful J-Pop loves in every sway
Sharing candies and stories in the warm sun glow
In the land of J-Pop friendships grow
J-Pop, J-Pop, full of song
In our land of joy we all belong
So come, let's sing our song so sweet
In our J-Pop land where happy hearts meet
Let's sing a song, let's ring a bell
In the J-Pop world where we love to dwell
Oh morning sun, oh clear blue sky
Let's hold our hands, watch the birds fly by
J-Pop, J-Pop, we sing and dance
In our land of dreams, we take the chance
We clap, we cheer, we delight every day
In our beautiful J-Pop, love's in every sway
Sharing candies and stories in the warm sun glow
In the land of J-pop friendships grow
In the land of J-pop friendships grow
In the war with the J-pop loves in every sway
Sharing candies and stories in the warm sun glow
In the land of J-pop friendships grow
In the land of J-Pop
Friendships grow
In our beautiful J-Pop
Love's in every sway
Oh morning song
Oh song so sweet
In our J-Pop land
Where happy hearts meet
So come let's sing
Let's ring a bell
In the J-Pop world
Where we love to dwell
