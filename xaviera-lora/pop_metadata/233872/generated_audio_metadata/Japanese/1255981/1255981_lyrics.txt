Wake up, it's a funny day, look outside, let's go out and play
With the sun so bright, the sky so blue
The world is a canvas filled with you
Under the cherry blossom tree
Laughing, playing, you and me
On a journey where dreams come true
One step further, a view that's new
Smile like the sunflower bright and yellow
Spreading joy making hearts mellow
Wake the fluffy clouds let's sail away
Into the dreamscape where magic lays
Under the cherry blossom tree
Laughing playing you and me
On our journey where dreams come true
One step further of you that's new
Under the cherry blossom tree
Laughing playing you and me
In a world where love is the clue
Hand in hand together we grew
Cotton candy in the sky
A rainbow delight
Wishes on the star
Twinkling so bright
Through the wind and the merry breeze
In the land of dreams let's seize
Under the cherry blossom tree
Laughing playing you and me
On our journey where dreams come true
One step further I feel that's new
So here's our song, sweet and simple
Like a joyful hunt with a dimple
Under a cherry blossom tree
We'll forever be
In a world of dreams wild and free
This song is just enough and quite simple
For a five-year-old child to memorize
This song is just enough and quite simple for a five year old child to memorize
