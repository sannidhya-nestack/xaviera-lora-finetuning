Come on the coast, where the waves crash and play
We'll share all our dreams until the night turns to day
With every kiss among the clouds melt away
Promises whispered softly, forever we'll stay
Heart's beat is one, melody of the sea
Love's tune in harmony, just you and me
Along the coast where the waves crash and play
We share our dreams until the night turns to day
With every kiss among the tides and out the way
Promises whispered softly, forever we'll stay
Hearts beat as one, melody of the sea
Love's tune and harmony, just you and me
Oh, heart beat is one
Melody fantasy
Love's tune in harmony
Just you and me
