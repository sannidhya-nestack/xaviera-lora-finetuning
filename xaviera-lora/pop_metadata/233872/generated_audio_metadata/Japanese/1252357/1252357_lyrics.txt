Melodies of summer weave through the air
With sunkissed laughter and moments to spare
Hand in hand, we wander the sandy shore
Sharing old tales and creating allures
The stars above bring rhythmic delight
Framing our dreams in the canvas of night
A symphony of whispers wrapped in a gentle breeze
In this endless horizon our hearts find their ease
Melodies of summer, weave through the air
With some kids laughter and moments to spare
Hand in hand, we wander the sandy shores
Sharing motels and creating new lores
The stars above blink in rhythmic delight
Framing our dreams in the canvas of night
A symphony of whispers wrapped in a gentle breeze
In this endless horizon our hearts find their ease
Set their ease
Horizon our hearts find their ease
In this endless horizon our hearts find their ease
