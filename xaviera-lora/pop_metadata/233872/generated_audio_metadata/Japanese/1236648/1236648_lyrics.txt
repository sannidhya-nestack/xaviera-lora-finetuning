In the city lights, a summer night, we dance like a sunshine, it's oh so bright, oh so bright (oh so bright)
We can't ever be, we can't lie (lie)
Feel the energy spreading far and wide, far and wide
Falling like heartbeat, racing in rhythm, limbo
Lost in the music, we can't be stopped, you're all the angle
Reflects in our eyes, unstoppable
Reaching for the skies, reaching for it's not the world, hear your sound
Feel the music as it takes you off the ground
Together as one, we're never gonna stop
In this neon sunshine, we'll reach the top
Top
We shift our heartbeat and race it in rhythm we move
Lost in the music we can't be stopped to all the encore
Reflects in our eyes we're unstoppable
Reaching for the skies reaching for a spark to walk in your sun
Feel the music as it takes you off the ground
Together as one we're never gonna stop
Give this neon sunshine, we'll reach the top
Top
We should talk
