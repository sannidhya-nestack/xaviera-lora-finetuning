When the moon is shining, I find my way to you
In this city of lights, our love shines through (ooh yeah)
We take a step, I take'em closer to your heart
Let's dance together, never be apart (ooh yeah)
Ooh yeah (ooh yeah)
I'm in the table, first to share a secret smile
In this enchanting moment, let's stay here for a while (Oh yeah)
Our love is like a melody, sweet and pure and true
Our hearts beating perfectly, just me and you
星に願いを込めて (Light the stars)
愛を歌おう
Let's sing of love
Hoshi ni kokoro tsukamare
Can't be beated by
Ai wo sasageyou
Let's sing of love
