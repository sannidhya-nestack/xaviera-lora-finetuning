Across the starry night
Shadows defy, hearts burn and break
Dancing in delight with every beat and sway
Let's melt away, come what may in our own ballet
Stories yet untold, with courage bold
Hands to hold, our love unfolds
To be in this dark, you're my spark
Moving onward like an eternal love
Whisper soft and sweet in a rhythmic beat
Making life complete as our spirits meet
Dreams take flight in the silent night
Holding tight'til we reach the light
Across the starry night, love's gentle by guiding light
Hearts burning bright
Across the starry night, love's gentle light
Guiding bright hearts, burning bright
With every beat and sway, let's melt away
Come what may, in our own ballet
Stories yet untold, but courage bold
Hands to hold, our love unfolds
Through the endless dark, you're my spark
Leaving a mark like an eternal lock
Whispered soft and sweet, in a rhythmic beat
Making life complete, as our spirits meet
Dreams take flight, in the silent night
Holding tight, till we reach the light
Across the flight, in the silent night
Holding tight, till we reach the light
Across the starry night
Love's gentle bright
Guiding bright
Heart's burning bright
Across the starry night
Love's gentle bright
Guiding bright
Heart's burning bright
Across the starry night
Love's gentle bright
