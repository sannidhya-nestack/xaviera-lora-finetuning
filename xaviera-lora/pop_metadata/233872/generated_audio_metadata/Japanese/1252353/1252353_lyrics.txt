On the rooftop looking high
Stars painting the evening sky
Boys collide in our embrace
Most together in this space
Whispers of love fill the air
Moments we will always share
In your eyes I see the fire
Burning with endless desire
The city hums with quiet songs as we find where we belong
Side by side, hand in hand, together we make our stand
Chasing dreams with open hearts, knowing we will never part
The moon sheds its silver light, guiding us through the night
Promises of a lifetime made, in each other's arms, unafraid
The universe, our endless, our endless sea, but together, you and me
On the rooftop looking high
Stars painting the evening sky
Words collide in our embrace
Lost together in this space
Whispers of love fill the air
Moments we will always share
In your eyes I see the fire
Burning with endless desire
The city hums with quiet songs
As we find where we belong
Side by side, hand in hand, together we make our stand
Chasing dreams with open hearts, knowing we will never part
The moonshine took silver light, guiding us through the night
Promises of a lifetime made in each other's arms, unafraid
The universe, our endless us, our endless me
Bound together, you and me
