Beneath the moonlit sky our spirits rise
A world of dreams before our eyes
Together we'll conquer mountains high
Reach the clouds and touch the sky
With every step our fears subside
With you there's nothing left to hide
Your laughter echoes through my mind
A symphony that's so divine
Every moment with you feels so blessed
In your love I find my rest
Despite the city's endless noise
In your arms I hear no other voice
Together we'll dive into the deep
An ocean of promises we keep
Beneath the moonlit sky our spirits rise
A world of dreams before our eyes
Together we'll conquer mountains high
Reach the clouds and touch the sky
Beneath the moonlit sky
Our spirits rise
A world of dreams before our eyes
Together we'll conquer mountains high
Reach the clouds and touch the sky
Oh, ooh, ooh
With every moment with you, feel so blessed
In your love I find my rest
Despite the city's endless noise
In your arms I hear no other voice
Together we'll dive into the deep
An ocean of promises we keep
Beneath the moonlit sky our spirits rise
A world of dreams before our eyes
Together we'll conquer mountains high
Reach the clouds and touch the sky
