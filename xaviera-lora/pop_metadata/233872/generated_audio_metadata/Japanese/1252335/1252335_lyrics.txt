Cherry blossoms sway in the gentle breeze
Memories of you and me under these trees
Time has passed but our love lasts
In every petal fall, hear our hearts call
Seasons may change, feelings remain the same
In the silence of spring, hear our hearts sing
A melody so true
It's the story of me and you
Through every bloom, dispelling the blue
Hand in hand, we understand
Love is our plan, forever it will stand
In the cherry blossom land
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Carry blossoms sway in the gentle breeze
Memories of you and me under these trees
Time has passed but our love lasts
In every petal fall, hear our hearts call
Seasons may change, feelings remain the same
In the silence of spring, hear our hearts sing
A melody so true, it's the story of me and you
Through every bloom, dispelling the gloom
Hand in hand, we understand
Love is our friend, forever it will stand
In the cherry blossom land
