Through the falling mist, I search for you
Your shadow lingers
Like the fading moon
Between two worlds we are torn apart
But still I carry you inside my heart
Winds of time whisper our name
Love like fire yet never the same
Across the sea, across the sky
I vow to find you, though lifetimes pass by
You are my silence, my endless light
Even in darkness, you shine so bright
Flowers always fall
But they're not gone
