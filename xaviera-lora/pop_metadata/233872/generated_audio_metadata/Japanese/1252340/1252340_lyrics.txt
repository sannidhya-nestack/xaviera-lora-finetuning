La la la mi la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la
In a city where dreams are born among the young lights that never mourn
We dance until we see the dawn in this Tokyo where our hearts are drawn
Embrace the night, the future's unknown, but here together we've grown
Stars in the sky, reflections in our eyes, feel the moments just glide by
Memories we'll never lose, dancing through the city news
Hearts beat as one under the setting sun, eternal journey just begun
In a city where dreams are born
Among neon lights that never mourn
We dance until we see the dawn
In this Tokyo where we're hearts are drawn
Embrace the night, the future's unknown
But here together we roam
Stars in the sky, reflections in our eyes
Feel the moments just glide by
Memories we'll never lose
Dancing through the city news
Hearts beat as one
Under the setting sun
Eternal journey just begun
In a city where dreams are born
Among the young lights that never mourn
We dance until we see the dawn
In this Tokyo where our hearts are drawn
Embrace the night, the future's unknown
But here together we flow
Stars in the sky, reflections in our eyes
Feel the moments just glide by
Memories we'll never lose
Dancing through the city new
Whose hearts beat as one
Under the setting sun
Eternal journey just begun
In a city where dreams are born
Among neon lights that never mourn
We dance until we see the dawn
In this Tokyo world where hearts are drawn
Embrace the night, the future's unknown
For here together we've grown
Stars in the sky, reflections in our eyes
Feel the moments just glide by
Memories we'll never lose
Dancing through the city news, hearts beat
