In the heart of Tokyo
Beneath the neon glow
To the rhythm of the city we sway to and fro
In the bustling streets
And onward we go
Where the sakura blossom, flutter like snow
Look at the stars so far and wide
In the rising sun our dreams reside
Hand in hand nothing seems bleak
In this wild dance that makes us speak
As the moon mirrors the light in your eyes
Through every hello and every goodbye
In a world that spins in technicolor
Five tiny wishes take a starry ride
Where dreams and love are intertwined
In the sunlit warmth, a heart's defined
Lost in the rhythm, lost in the beat
In the world of ours, two souls meet
Koi fish swim in the dreams we spin
In the city so we're lost within
Ring the bells of hope, let the tale unfold
In our whispered truths, the stories told
Through the city's song that echoes wide
In this timeless waltz, side by side
In the rising sun, our dreams defined
In love's sweet rhythm forever
