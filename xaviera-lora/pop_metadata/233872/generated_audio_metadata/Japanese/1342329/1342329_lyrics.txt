Through the forest I search for you
Your shadow lingers like the leaping moon
Between two worlds we are torn apart
But I'd still like carry
Whisper our name
Love like fire yet never the same
Across the sea, across the sky
I vow to find you
Though lifetimes pass by
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
El Siriano echo
You are my silent smile
Even in darkness
You shine so bright
Flowers always fall
But there is wind
Flowers always fall, but there is wind
Flowers always fall, but there is wind
Flowers always fall, but there is wind
Flowers always fall, but there is wind
