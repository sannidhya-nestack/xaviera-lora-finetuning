Seeking like Stika, a symphony of our fates
Lost in the rhythm, no reason to hesitate
Dreams collide in the melodies we share
Fingers intertwined, a bond beyond compare
Whispered secrets under the neon glow
In the language of love only we know
In the echoes of our laughter, time stands still
With you life is a beautiful thrill
Pretty life like a, a symphony of all fate
Lost in the rhythm, no reason to hesitate
Dreams collide in the melody we share
Fingers intertwined, a bond beyond compare
Who's the secret thunder, the neon glow
In the language of love only we know
In the echoes of our laughter, time stands still
With the light is a beautiful thrill
But your life is a beautiful thrill
But your life is a beautiful thrill
Whispered secrets under the neon glow
In the language of love only we know
In the echoes of our laughter time stands still
With you life is a beautiful thrill
