まなしの手をすすぐ (oh oh oh)
Kiss like sakura, delicate starts to flow
Kiss like sakura, delicate and pure
Ah, emotions they adore
But we know it don't fit, it's clear to me, friend
And now the round is forever spread (forever spread)
Calling all the toxic mix and friend
Now the round is forever spread
恋の歌 singing in the midnight
Let our love shine, lights up so bright
Moment of bliss like a crashing wave
心の今, our hearts are playing
Kokoro wo irau na
Our hearts are brave
Spark of love
Kimetsu ni mou to (I'm on it)
Cannot hide
Kono mama is close
Sweet and long lost
The melody starts to flow
恋の歌 (koi no uta)
Singing in the night
Let our love shine light
It's all so bright
Momentum you feel
Like crashing away
心の合間 (koboro no aima)
Our hearts are brave
Oh, our hearts are brave
Oh, knowing that our hearts are brave
