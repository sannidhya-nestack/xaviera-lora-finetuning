Good morning sun, hello sky
A beautiful day, let's fly on by
Friends to see, games to play
Life is an adventure every single day
Turn around, let's all dance
Life is a song, take a chance
Jump, jump higher and higher
Reach for your dreams in the sky
Rain or shine, day or night
Let the brave heart take flight
With the rainbow high or stars so bright
Everything's magic in the right light
Glowing or shine, day or night
With a brave heart take flight
With the rainbow high or a star so bright
Everything's magic in the right light
Turn around let's all sing
Joy and laughter is what we bring
Jump, jump up and away
In our magical world we play
Bye bye day hello night
Thank you stars for the bright light
Sleep, sleep tight and tight
Tomorrow will be another day bright
