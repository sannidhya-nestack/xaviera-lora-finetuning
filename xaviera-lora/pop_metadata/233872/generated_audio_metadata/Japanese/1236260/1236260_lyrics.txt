When the moon is shining, I'll find my way to you
In this city of neon lights, our love shines through
With every step I take, I'm closer to your heart
Let's dance together, never be apart
Underneath the cherry blossoms we share a secret smile
In this ancient moment let's stay here for a while
Our love is like a melody sweet and pure and true
Our hearts beating in perfect harmony
Just me and you
星に願いを込めて
愛の歌を let's sing out loud
Hoshi ni kokoro tsukamarete
Captivated by the stars
Sasageyou
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Time goes to you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no
