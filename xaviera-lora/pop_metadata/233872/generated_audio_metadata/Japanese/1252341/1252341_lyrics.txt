Underneath these neon lights, a future's intertwined
Dancing through the crowded streets, your hand always in mine
Blossoming sweet promises with hope that never dies
Just like the sunrise, your love is my guide
No shadow can darken the bond that we share
With every heartbeat, I show that I care
We'll keep on walking, forever side by side
Until the end of time, in you I confide
