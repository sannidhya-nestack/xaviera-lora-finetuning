In the flurry of the dying state night
The people of time and night
The wind and sorrow in their time
Searching for a sign
From the heart of Tokyo shine
Lost in time
Finding where we're meant to be
In the chaos of these dreams
Hand in hand we stand
Rewriting destiny
Together we'll find the way to the night and day
Holding on to what feels right
Chasing stars in the moonlight our future's bright
No more fear, our path is clear
Through the city lights our love will steer
In the city, light streams take flight
Wandering souls find their light
Love and sorrow intertwine
Searching for a sign
In the heart of Tokyo shine
Lost in time
Finding what we're meant to be
In the chaos of these streets
Hand in hand we stand
Rewriting destiny together
We'll find the way
Through the night and day
We'll find a way through the night and day
Holding on to what feels right
Chasing stars in the moonlight
Our future bright, no more fear
Our path is clear
Through the city lights our love will steer
Fear, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Over the open day
Hoping on to what feels right
Chasing stars in the moonlight
A future bright, no more fear
Our path is clear
Through the city of lights our love will steer
