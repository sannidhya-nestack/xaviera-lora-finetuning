視界で行こう Don't be shy, oh yeah
Move your body, head into the sky
Feel the rhythm, beat the side
Let the music be your guide
Jump around and feel the beat
Up and down, move your feet
Join the party, feel the heat
Dancing in the night, so sweet yeah
Hands up high, let's go wild
It's the night, feel the fire
We'll dance together, side by side
Come on, let's dance in the light
Let the rhythm collide
Come on, let's dance in the light
Let the rhythm collide
Jump around and feel the beat, up and down, and down
Move your feet to feel the heat, feel the heat
Sing in the moonlight, let the music be your guide
Jump around and feel the beat, up and down
Move your feet, join the party, feel the heat
Dancing in the moonlight, so, so sweet
Hands up high, let's go wild
It's the night, feel the vibe
We'll dance together side by side
Come on, let the rhythm collide
Let the rhythm collide
Come on, let the rhythm collide
Let the rhythm collide
Let the rhythm high, let's go wild
It's the night, feel the vibe
We'll dance together side by side
Come on now, let the rhythm collide
Oh oh, here we go
完成には、かれでしょ?
Oh oh, don't you know?
It's gonna stick, gonna make you go
