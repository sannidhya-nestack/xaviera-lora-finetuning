Beneath the moonlight, skies, phoenix rise
A world of dreams before our eyes
Together we'll conquer mountains high
Reach the clouds and touch the sky
With every step our fears subside
With you there's nothing left to hide
Your laughter echoes through my mind
Symphony that's so divine
Every moment with you feels so blessed
In your love I find my rest
Despite the cities and bliss noise
In your arms I hear no other voice
Together we'll dive into the deep
An ocean of promises we keep
Beneath the moonlit sky, spirits rise
A world of dreams before our eyes
Together we'll conquer mountains high
Reach the clouds and touch the sky
Moonlit the moonlit breeze
When the world is still asleep
Our hearts align in tender peace
In your gaze I find my keep
With every whisper promises grow
A love story only we know
In the quiet morning breeze
When the world is still asleep
Our hearts align in tender peace
In your gaze I find my keep
With every moment with you feel so blessed
In your love I find my rest
Despite the city's endless noise
In your arms I hear no other voice
In the quiet morning breeze when the world is still asleep
Our hearts align in tender peace, in your gaze I find my keep
With every whisper promises grow, a love story only we know
Underneath the starry sky where dreams are spun
We write our tale becoming one
The future's past so wide and far
Wherever you are, that's where we are
With every heartbeat, a new chapter starts
Written in the ink of our hearts
Through the valleys deep and mountains high
In your love, my fears fly
The world's a stage and we're the show
On this journey, endlessly we'll go
Underneath the starry sky, which dreams are spun
We write our tale and we come along
'Cause you just pass so wide and far wherever you are that's where we are
