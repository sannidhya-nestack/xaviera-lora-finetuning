Whispers in the night are soft lullaby
Echoes of a time when you were mine
Trace of yesterday slowly fade away
But in my heart you'll stay forever in a secret place
Shadows of regret trying to et
Every word I'm said living in my head but
Hope still remains in the midnight rains
Washing away the pain with every drop of new beginning
Though it's hard to cope
I'll find that ray of hope in those first of the night
Love, love will find the light
Stars forming like rain across the midnight sky
Hand in hand we fly into the unknown together
No need for words tonight, let our hearts unite
Rhythm of our souls guiding us on this road
Through every line in love, love will grow stronger with each day
In this endless play, melodies and dreams
That's what love is
Dancing in the night, under the starlight
