Hello! (Hello!)
Be genki ni go aisatsu (ayagosai)
I want a lovely day
Every time kagami mite (Hot)
Kouhoende (Smile)
Ribbon wa pink sore to no white?
Which one would you prefer?
Last night I made a tell-tale boat too
That's why the sun is shining bright
The way I feel right now
You can cry above the crowd
I'm so glad I get to see you today
Another Donut special day
Daisuki, the girl I want to know all about you
Won't you please tell me? おしえて
You're shy so you don't talk to me 話してよ
それがいつも funny させるの おねがい
Uri Uri hai my master
I know I love you, I hate you, I'm in trouble
I know I don't know, but jealousy is overflowing
If I touch you, it's a big trouble for you
But let me be a good man for you
Master, chu chu chu yes
Maybe baby first kiss, oh, chu chu chu, yay!
Come to Paralympic Baby Lounge, okie dokie!
大好きなカップケーキもストロベリーショートケーキも
I can't live without the thoughts of you
It's my first time in love
When shall we meet again?
ためいきまじりでゆらゆら
ミルクティー冷めてちゃう
You told me that you love me
I'm your only one
Why didn't you run after me? どうして?
You say you're sorry and you have only me
ごめんね (ごめんね)
But all you ever think of are these words
お願い (お願い)
We give you nya-nya hi, hoi, hello, my master
Just how can I help you? Can I know?
ねぇって言えばあなたのお手伝いしたいだけなの?
そうだよ君がやっぱり僕のラブリーナンバーワン (yeah)
Oh oh you are my 一番ナンバーワン
