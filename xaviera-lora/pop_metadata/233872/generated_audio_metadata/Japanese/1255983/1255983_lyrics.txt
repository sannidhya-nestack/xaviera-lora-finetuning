Wake up, it's a shiny day
But we're so late, let's go out and play
With the sun so bright, the sky so blue
The world is a canvas filled with you
Under the cherry blossom tree
Laughing, playing, you and me
On a journey where dreams come true
One step further, a view that's new
Smile like the sunflower, bright and yellow
Spreading joy, making hearts mellow
With the fluffy clouds, let's sail away
Into the dream state where magic lays
Under the cherry blossom tree
Loving playing you and me
In a world where love is the clue
Hand in hand, together we grew
Cotton candy in the sky, a rainbow delight
Wishes on the stars, twinkling so bright
Through the wind and the merry breeze
In the land of dreams, let's seize
Under the cherry blossom tree
Nothing playing, you and me
With the starlight creating the beautiful view
In a world full of dreams, just me and you
So here's our song, sweet and simple
Like a joyful heart with a dimple
Under the cherry blossom tree you will forever be
In a world of dreams wild and free
This song is just enough and quite simple
For a five-year-old child to memorize
Wake up, rise and shine
Get ready for a day so fine
Put on your shoes, tie your lace
Today we will win the race
Jump, jump, jump high up in the sky
Touch the stars as you fly by
Round, round, spin so free
Happy as happy as can be
See, see the bright sun glow
Feel the wind as it softly blows
Look all around at the sights you see
What a wonderful world it can be
Jump, jump, jump high up in the sky
Touch the stars as you fly by
Round and round, spin so free
Happy as happy as can be
Say goodnight to the twinkling star
Dream sweet dreams wherever you are
Quiet quiet, close your eyes
As the moon shines in the skies
This song is designed to be catchy and simple
Enough for a young child to remember
Say goodnight to the twinkling star
Dream sweet dreams wherever you are
Quiet, quiet, close your eyes
As the moon shines in the skies
This song is designed to be catchy and simple enough
For a young child to remember
Jump jump jump high up in the sky
Touch the stars as you fly by
Roundhouse spins all free
Happy as happy as can be
Wake up, it's a shiny day
Look outside, let's go out and play
With the sun so bright, the sky so blue
