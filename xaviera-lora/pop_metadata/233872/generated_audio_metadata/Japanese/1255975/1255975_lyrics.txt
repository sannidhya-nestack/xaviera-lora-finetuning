Lighter than the old lights we found our vibe
Lost in a city where dreams collide
Your smile dazzling brighter than the Tokyo skies
In your eyes found a love that never lies
Sing me the soprano bloom when we dance away
Under the same moonlight lost in the fray
Our hearts beat in harmony in this urban ballet
Oh Tokyo nights, wish you could forever stand
In the crowd and the noise found a serene pleasure
Our shared laughter's moments of treasure
Navigating Tokyo streets in a love so major
In your arms found the world's greatest treasure
The sun sent whispers sweet promises anew
In the city of lights love's the only view
Through lanes and alleys our affections grew
Oh Tokyo Twilight painted in beautiful hue
Beneath the Sakura bloom we dance away
Under the same old light lost in the fray
Our hearts beat in harmony in this urban ballet
Oh Tokyo nights wish you could forever stay
In the crowd, in the noise, found a serene pleasure
Our shared laughter's moments to treasure
Navigating Tokyo streets, in our love's own measure
In your arms, found the world's greatest treasure
In the crowd, in the noise, found a serene pleasure
Our shared laughter's moments to treasure
Our shared laughter's moments to treasure
Moments to treasure
Navigating Tokyo streets
In our love zone in LA
In the city of lights
Love's the only view safe
In the city of dreams
We've made our own
In every beat
Our love has only grown
From dusk till dawn
In every light show
Hold still for your heartbeats
Play our love's tone
