Walking through the streets of Tokyo under the endless night
Neon lights sparkling bright reflecting in your eyes
Our hands touch hearts collide no need for words to hide
In the glow of the moonlight feels like I'm in flight
Oh, we're dancing on a dream
Where love plays the rhythm
A symphony in every heartbeat
A melody without limits
Under the Sakura skies
Under the starry nights
We're painting the world with lost colors
And it's oh so right
In a world where dreams meet reality
Our silhouettes blending
Falling stars in the sky
Make a wish as they descend
In a silent whisper
My heart you tenderly meant
Kisses sweet as candy
Love knows we silently said
We're spinning around in a melody
Where passion is our symphony
In the rhythm of the city
In the whisper of the breeze
Underneath the lantern lights
In the gentle Tokyo night
Our hearts beat together in harmony
Oh what a sight
As we crossed the Shibuya, loved echoes in the night
Underneath the Tokyo sky, our hearts became the light
In this dance of love and dreams, our hearts will never tire
Our Tokyo love story sets the world on fire
In a world where dreams meet reality, our silhouettes blending
