Dancing on the paper lanterns, hearts full of good love
Empty canter, gold and cherries, people with a shiny life
Now the fireworks, still empty stars, they've been butchered, yet your gaze
Still in every heartbeat, your memory stares ablaze
When you say, "Don't worry about it, you're my mommy's shining light"
And all the fireworks that you wish you were my shining light
But the fireworks feel empty, so I still love all your games
So in every heartbeat your memories set ablaze
What a grace
Such a grace
A grace
