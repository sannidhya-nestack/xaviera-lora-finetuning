Through the falling mist, I search for you
Your shadow lingers like the fading moon
Between two worlds
We are torn apart
But still I carry you inside my heart
Winds of time
Whisper our name
Love like fire
Yet never the same
Across the sea
Across the sky
I vow to find you, though lifetimes pass by
You
My endless light
Even in darkness
You shine so bright
Flowers always fall
