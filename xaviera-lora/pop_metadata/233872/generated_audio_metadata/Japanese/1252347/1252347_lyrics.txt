Under the beautiful sun, we'll make our love
A promise eternal here and now
Heaven's guests here, dancing with the wind
These waiting moments where it's all for time again
With each step forward and no reason for
The warmth of our journey each story's told
Seasons may change, but our song remains
In this serenade, love's the same
Ro-o-o-o-o-o-o
Oh, it's the same
Under the cherry blossoms, we make our vow
A promise eternal here and now
Cuddles cascade, dancing with the wind
These fleeting moments, where does the time begin?
With each step forward memories unfold
The warmth of our journey stories told
Seasons may change but our song remains
In this serenade love sustains
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Under the cherry blossoms, we made a vow
