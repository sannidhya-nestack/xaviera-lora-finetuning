In Tokio town, there the neon lights blaze
Walking by your side, feeling your warm gaze
The city sparkles with lighting in your eyes
Under the starry canopy, our hearts harmonize
Lost in the rhythm found in the song
In this J-pop symphony you totally belong
We dance, we dream beneath the moon so strong
And in this animated city I love phones
Nighttime descends, the city escapes the delight
Our love story unfolds in this magical night
In the city's heartbeat, our dreams take flight
Under the cosmos we ignite
Caught in the melody, in city brightness
Our duet of light, in the sparkling haze
We laugh, we weep in the neon, soaring place
In the euphony of J-pop, our heart spirits blaze
Walking through Tokyo underneath the night
In the symphony of J-pop our hearts feel light
Just you and me embracing the incandescent sight
In the melody of J-pop we dance'til daylight
Lost in the rhythm, found in the song
In this J-pop symphony, you totally belong
We dance, we dream beneath the moons, I'm strong
And in this animated city, our love dawns
Lights and the sense that cityscapes are delight
Our love story unfolds in this magical night
In the city's heartbeat our dreams take flight
Under the cosmos we ignite
Caught in the melody in city-wide maze
Our duet of love in the sparkling haze
We laugh, we weep in the neon's alluring blaze
In the euphony of chain pop our heart's spirits blaze
