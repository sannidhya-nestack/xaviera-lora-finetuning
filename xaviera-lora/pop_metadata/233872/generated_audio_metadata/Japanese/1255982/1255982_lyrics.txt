In the void, I'm into your mind
Under the neon lights, oh what a sight
You won't have to let go, won't go through city escape
Every single moment I wish to take
We're caught in canvas, painted by a star
In an urban symphony we are
We dance through streets under evening's glow
In Tokyo's rhythm our love does flow
We're caught in canvas painted by a star
In an urban symphony we are
We dance through streets under evening's glow
In Tokyo's rhythm, our love does grow
Through the bustling city we wander hand in hand
Exploring every corner of this enchanted land
Our love story written in city sand
In your arms I find my wonderland
Under the crescent moon sky
Together we enjoy the rollercoaster ride
In Tokyo's embrace we confide
In every corner of our brief edge to hide
In Tokyo nights under the gleaming stars
We painted our love story to avoid a penny scars
In happiness city fluids full of ours
We danced in fluids to our last memoirs
Under the bustling city we wander hand in hand
