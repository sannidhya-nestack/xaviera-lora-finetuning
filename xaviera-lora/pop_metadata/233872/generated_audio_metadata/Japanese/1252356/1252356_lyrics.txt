With sprinklings of the cherry blossoms
Caffeine got like snow
A promise made under the sakura
Our love began to grow
Through seasons and time our bond did only strengthen
An eternal dance of harmony our hearts will lengthen
As petals fall around us a testament to our fate
Hand in hand we wander through heaven's open gate
For you my love I would wait a thousand years
With you by my side I have no fears
Whispering winds in the cherry blossoms
Cascading down like snow
A promise made under the sakura
Our love began to grow
Through seasons and time, our bond did only strengthen
An eternal dance of harmony, our hearts will lengthen
As petals fall around us, a testament to our fate
Hand in hand we wander, through heaven's open gate
For you my love, I would wait a thousand years
With you by my side, I have no fears
For you, my love, I would wait a thousand years
With you by my side, I have no fears
Whispering winds and the cherry blossoms
Cascading down like snow
A promise made under the sakura
Our love began to grow
Through seasons and time
Our bond did only strengthen
That eternal dance of harmony
Our hearts will lengthen
As petals fall around us
A testament to our fate
Hand in hand we wander
Through heaven's open gate
For you my love
I would wait a thousand years
With you by my side
I have no fears
