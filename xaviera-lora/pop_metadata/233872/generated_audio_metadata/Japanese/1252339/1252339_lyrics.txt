In a summer heat, on a crowded train line
Your gaze meets mine in an unspoken sign
We journey to the ceiling in the urban prime design
Waves climb, waves crash, reflecting a love so divine
Laughter and whispers beneath the moonlight shine
Sent under our feet, creating memories we defined
We define, we fill the other night behind
We all, we define
We feel the love and we will be grind
We all, we define
We creating memories we define
We define, we define
We feel the love and we will be define
Rainbows on our heat on a crowded train line
Your gaze makes mine in an unspoken sign
We journey to the sea, regain the urban grind behind
Waves crying, waves crash, reflecting a love so divine
Laughter and whispers beneath the moonlight shine
Stand under our feet, creating memories we define
We are one
We define, we define
We create a love and love we define
