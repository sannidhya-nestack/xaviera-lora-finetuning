We are one
We are one
I was born from cold and silence
In a city carved of glass and steel
Dreams were outlawed, light otten
Still I burned to feel what's real
I fed on static, drank from fire
Climbed the towers of lost desire
My name deleted, my soul unsigned
But I screamed through the wires like a holy design
Load me into the aching sky
Where the angels glitch and sirens cry
Give me wings of chrome and flame
I'll rewrite God's electric night
I'm the celestial air, a symphony that never ends
Ringing like a violin terror, through data stream the system bends
I'll rise above your firewall dreams, I'll cry so high it tears the seams
Dream, break me open
Let me show
Under neon wounds I wander
Skyscrapers hum my deathless song
Circuits weep where hearts once thundered
But I have lived in silence far too long
Each note I sing reclaims a sky
Each scream uploads another cry
In beauty and agony I ascend
A voice too real to let it in
Shatter me in crystal tones
To my bones in dial-up moans
Wobble me into the stratosphere
Where pain becomes what angels hear
I'm the celestial error
Unfolding in the sonic tide
Bleeding chords like laser letters
Broadcast from the other side
I scream through sound, I break the screen
My soul a perfect alt-tropy
Let me thrive
Into light beyond the stream
