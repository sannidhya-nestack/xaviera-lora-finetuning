This world is one huge living anism
From small bugs to giant whales
From this tiny earth to the boundless universe
Like the cells in our body
And the countless number of stars in the sky
Our existence will be born and die
And reincarnate over and over again
The time in this world is repetitive
The sweat of summer has a sense of the cold breath of winter
One fall is connected to another rise
Our future leads us to the past
Don't focus on the order of time or time itself
What will be will be
And now
The wandering sequence has started again
Prepare for the next pilgrimage
