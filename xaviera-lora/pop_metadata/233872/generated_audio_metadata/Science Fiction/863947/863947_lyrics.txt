It changes the gravity of my whole life
Well now we might as well finish it
I never told this to anybody
I can be
Insecure from the past it makes me
Sometimes feel so strong
I can feel fearless and I get brave
I become the Aztec warrior
The one who ate twenty-four hearts
Am I your Egyptian prince?
No, the past has gone.
Zit! It's gone!
Oooo-haaa
Oh how, oh how the past has gone
When we reach the light
I'll be gone too
And you'll be gone too
Am I your Egyptian prince?
Don't say that anymore
The past has gone
the past is gone
I've said the past is gone
Don't come like that
Quit gone like that
Gone like that, yes gone like that, gone like that, gone like that
Switch, switch, gone like that
It's gone like that
Ooh, it's gone like that
Yeah, she's gone like that
Gone like that
Good boy, I'll be gone, he and you, you'll be gone like that
Goodbye, good boy, goodbye, good boy
Speak to doom all alone
It's what we have to do
We are there to help you
