Calling all cars, calling all cars
We have an escaped psycho on the loose
Suspect is armed and dangerous, repeat
Suspect is armed and dangerous
You'll never catch me, coppers!
Calling all cars! Calling all cars!
Suspect spotted! Apprehend with caution!
Headquarters, this is Officer Dano! We need backup! He's all over us!
Copy that Dan-o, copy that
Backup is on the way
We know just who to call
I'll take the call
Oh, you know who we're talkin' about?
Headquarters, this is Officer Dano
We got him cornered, but we still need more backup
Headquarters, thanks for all the reinforcements, we got'em
Copy that Dan-o
Once again this just shows
Crime doesn't pay
