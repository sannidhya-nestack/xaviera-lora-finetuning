(laughing)
It was one quick message, just a few copies
I got my business
I got my business
Started saying it, started saying it, started saying it, started saying it, started saying it, started saying it, started saying it, started saying it, started saying it, started saying it, started saying it, started saying it, started saying it, started saying it, started saying it, started saying it, started saying it, started saying it, started saying it.
(Sorry, thank you, sorry, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you)
(Synchronic, synchronic)
(Chorus)
Sit down, sit down
MS-4, requesting assistance, do you copy?
MS-4, requesting assistance, do you copy?
Why am I doing this?
Why am I doing this?
