I'm pickin' up, I'm, I'm pickin' up, good vibrations
I love the colourful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I, I hear the sound of her gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air
Pick it up, good vibrations, she's giving me the excitations
Pick it up, good vibrations, she's giving the excitations
Pick it up, good vibrations, she's giving you the excitations
Pick it up, good vibrations, she's giving me the excitations
Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
I look in her eyes, she goes with me to a blossom world
She's giving me the excitations (excitations)

Oh my, my, what a sensation
I don't know where but she sends me there
Oh my, my, what a sensation
Oh my, my, what a sensation
Oh my, my, what a sensation
She's beautiful
That's right
She's beautiful
You know I love her
You know I gotta
Gotta keep those loving good vibrations happening with her
Gotta keep those loving good vibrations happening with her
Gotta keep those loving good vibrations happening with her all the time
Breaking up good vibrations she's giving me the expectations
I wanna make it up to the vibrations, she's giving me the x-factor (x-factor)
I wanna make it up to the vibrations, she giving me the x-factor (x-factor)
I'm pickin' up good vibes, I'm pickin' up good vibes, I'm pickin' up good vibes
Good vibrations
