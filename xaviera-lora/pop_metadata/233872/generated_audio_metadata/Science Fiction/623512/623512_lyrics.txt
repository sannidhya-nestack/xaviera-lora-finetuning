A silver surfer rides again
In the metropolis
Decent citizens try to sleep at night
But underneath it all
A dark secret lurks
What will they do if crime runs rampant in the city?
It's time to call a member of the Superhero Federation
The Silver Surfer
The Silver Surfer rides again
The Silver Surfer rides again
Only one man can right the wrong
Only one man can bring them to justice
The Silver Surfer
The Silver Surfer
The Silver Surfer rides again
Mobs of angry criminals roaming wild on the streets
Without a care about decent law-abiding citizens
No one is safe
(Ridge, Ridge, Ridge)
The Silver Surfer rides again
The conqueror of Galactus Prime
Primed and ready
To boosh into action
And change Earth into the Utopia it was created to be
A Silver Surfer
Only one man stands tall
Only one
Silver Surfer
So, the Silver Surfer rides again
Riding to the top and protecting the innocent citizen of the city
The silver surfer (hey, hey, hey)
The silver surfer rides again (hey, hey, hey)
It's not like anything you've ever seen
Only one man
The Silver
