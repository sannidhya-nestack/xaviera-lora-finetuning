I'm the disco tiki, spitting lots of fire
I can make you dance and make you sweat at my desire
I'm the disco tiki, dancing in my cave
Looking for some disco queens and turn them into slaves
Round, round, round with the tiki
We go round, round, round to the sound
Down, down, down with the chiggies
Down, down, down to the ground
Attack of the disco chiggies
A fire breathing tiki, glowing eyes so bright
I'm a tiki god of fire, let's party tonight
I'm a disco tiki, breathing smoke and fire
I can heat you up and make you scream at my desire
Round, round, round with the cheeky, you go round, round, round to the sound
Down, down, down with the cheeky, you get down, down, down to the ground
Attack of the Disco Cheekys
Residents are warned, "lock your doors" as law enforcement tries to stop the wild dance attacks that have ravaged towns and cities across the nation
We are speaking to you through the translating device above your head
Visitors from another world
Ultrasonic vibrations
Disgust, disgust
Attack of the Disco Tickies
I'm the disco tiki, breathing smoke and fire
I can heat you up and make you scream at night as I yawn
I'm the DJ tiki, I can give you quite a fright
I can cast a magic spell on you with all my tiki might
Round round round with the tiki you go round round round
Get down, down, down to the ground, round, round, round with the chicken, go round, round, round to the sound, down, down, down with the chicken, get down, down, down to the ground
Attack of the Disco Tiggies
Disco Tiggies
Coming to a town near you
