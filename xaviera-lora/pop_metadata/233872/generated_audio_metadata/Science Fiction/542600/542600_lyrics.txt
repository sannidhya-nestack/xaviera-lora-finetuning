Out across the universe
In a different time and space
Surely there's a planet
That hosts another race

Is anybody really there?
Tune in your receiver
Your remote control
Surely you can feel
it's there within your soul
Sendin' out a message

Is anybody really there?
Hello, hello
Is there anybody there?
Is there anybody there?
Is there anybody there?
Out across the universe
In a different time and space
Surely there's a planet
That hosts another race

Hello, is there anybody there?
