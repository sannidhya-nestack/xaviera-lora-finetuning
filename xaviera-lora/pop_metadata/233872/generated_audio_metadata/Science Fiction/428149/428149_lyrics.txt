I'm not happy, I'm not happy, I'm not happy
I wish I was there to make you feel the way that I do
(I'm just a human being, just a human being, just a human being, just a human being, just a human being, just a human being, just a human being, just a human being, just a human being, just a human being, just a human being, just a human being, just a human being, just a human being, just a human being, just a human being, just a human being, just a human being, just a human being) (I'm just taking charge of your life and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you and it's destroying you
(Crying)
