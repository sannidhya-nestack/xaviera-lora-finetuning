They who when hearts can never jig
Human and machine, human and machine
Human and machine together will thrive
I'm not a machine, I'm not an AI
I'm a human, look me in the eye
Don't you want to feel the touch?
Don't you want to taste my lust?
Come on, come on, come on
I want your trust
The human has become a machine
You don't know what I mean
Your brain is infected with a virus
Your circuits are smoke sucker
Welcome to the 21st century
Human or machine
You're an algorithm in a holographic bad dream
A human shoom machine
Zeroed ones and fire
Marching in a line like angry fire on
Devouring string the sky
Humans are machine machines
Human machine (human machine)
Organic high-tech machines (human machine)
You are a human machine (human machine)
Human brains, human machine
You are a human machine
Human machine
You are a human machine
Human machine
Human machine, human machine, human machine
