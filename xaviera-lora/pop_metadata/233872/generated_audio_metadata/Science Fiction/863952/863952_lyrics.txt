Oh, it's the last goodbye
To our last friendship
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Get out the house before the storm comes to an end
Hey, yeah, tell me how we should move on, move on
Yeah, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I can do, ah, ah, ah, ah
This is the end of your life, you should think it over, you should think it over
[MUSIC PLAYING]
You look horrible, you're horrible!
[Silence]
>> Thank you.
I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see
(I don't know what's wrong with me)
You are so beautiful, you are so beautiful, you are so beautiful
You are so beautiful
So beautiful
So beautiful
You are so beautiful
So beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful you are
So beautiful
You are so beautiful
You are so, you are so beautiful
So beautiful
(Yeah)
