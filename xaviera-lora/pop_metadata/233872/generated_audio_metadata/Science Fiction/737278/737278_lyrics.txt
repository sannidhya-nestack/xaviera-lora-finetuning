We have designed our laboratories so that our experiences can be easily duplicated at other institutions
We have restricted ourselves to the use of standard equipment interfaces
And software that are freely available
As our research suggests, we will be the leading institution for artificial intelligence interfaces
And interfaces
I'm not in your business
The poor devil's in for a serious comic-con
I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, I'm too weak
Agitation, intelligence
