I'll keep a laugh
I'll keep a laugh
I'll keep a laugh
Al-Qibla
Africa the mother of mankind's creation
Al-Qibla
Africa gave birth to peoples in all nations
Al-Qibla
They came there from Africa migration
Al-Qibla
Africa the continent of exploitation
Al-Qibla
White man left our country in devastation
Oh Africa, oh Africa
Africa, oh Africa
Al-Kibula, al-Kibula
Al-Kibula, al-Kibula
I see the ghosts of my people on slavery ships
They be chained, whipped and hit
Taken from Africa to Europe and America
Taken from Africa to Europe and America
Over two hundred years of white man's aggression
Zimbabwe and South Africa kicked out the oppression
African leaders, corruption brings them power and wealth
They don't care for the lives of the poor people or their health
Al-Qibla, Africa, oh Africa, Al-Qibla, Africa, oh Africa
Al-Qibla, Al-Qibla, Al-Qibla, Al-Qibla, Al-Qibla, oh Africa
The white man converted us to Christianity
They travelled ten thousand miles for this insanity
Why couldn't they just leave us alone
Who invited them into our lands into our homes
They rip our land for diamonds
They rip our land for gold
They use our children as slave labour
The truth is not allowed to be told
Africa, oh Africa (Al-Kibulan)
Africa, oh Africa (Al-Kibulan, Al-Kibulan)
Al-Kiboulam
Al-Kiboulam, Al-Kiboulam
Al-Kiboulam
Village woman walks five miles to the well
Water is precious here, you can tell
The babies they die of hunger and disease
Covered by flies in the heat of 120 degrees
Al-Kiboulam
Ah
Al-Qibla, al-Qibla, al-Qibla
And the stars come and adopt a token baby
Has the world gone crazy
With all the wealth that they got?
What about the thousands of others they ot?
Africa, oh Africa
Africa, oh Africa
All African brothers and sisters unite
Corruption and oppression they must fight
And take control of the wealth of the land
To benefit every African woman, child and man
Al-Qibla
Africa, oh Africa
Africa, oh Africa
The mother of mankind's creation
Al-Qibla, Al-Qibla
Al-Qabila
Al-Qibla
Al-Qibla, Al-Qibla
