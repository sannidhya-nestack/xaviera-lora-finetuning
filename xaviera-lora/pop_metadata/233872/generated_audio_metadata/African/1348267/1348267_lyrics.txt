For the longest time we did this dance
Trying to pretend we're just friends
We tried so hard to avoid romance
Now I know your touch sends me in ecstasy
People try to warn us that friends can't be lovers
But I think we proved them wrong
when we get under the covers
I could make love to you all night long
As long as there is love
Oh there is love
Oh yes there's love
I'll never hurt you
I'll never hurt you
As long as there's love
I'll never hurt you
I'll never hurt you
As long as the moon shines up above
I'll never hurt you
I'll never hurt you
Lovers can be friends when times are good
Just as much as when times are bad
So let me love you like I should
And I know that you will feel real glad
I hope you'd always know
As long as there is love
Oh there is love
Oh yes there's love
I'll never hurt you
I'll never hurt you as long as there's love
I'll never hurt you, I'll never hurt you
As long as the moon shines up above
I'll never hurt you, I'll never hurt you
And that's how I know
I'll never hurt you
I'll never hurt you
