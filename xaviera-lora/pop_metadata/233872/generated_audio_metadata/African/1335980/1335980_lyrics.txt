What's up? What's up? What's up?
What's your issue?
It's the vision for the past
Intervention order (Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)
Go away, busholaki
Maybe you get what you want, eh? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say be happy
If you don't get it
Please say there's an ambad
Maybe tomorrow you'll get it (Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Intervention order (Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)
Here comes the police, eh? (Whoo!)
You're under arrest, man
Must remain in silence
What's your problem? Oh, please, you go get a virgin oil!
They say you want to disappear before the time
No, no, no, no, no, no
I think they et this
They are not immortal
Surprise, surprise
You always hide your pain inside
And your tears never come out
Really?
Because, because
They say I should find a lawyer
The lawyer, the police, the judges, lawyers, judges, immigration, ministers, all lawmakers
Intervention order
No no no no no no
Days, weeks, months, years are passing by
You are not getting younger anymore
When you look back
Your past you realize
You are not younger anymore
What's up, what's up, what's up
Intervention order
In the vision of God
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You new man
You realize it's far away
Immediation
For the old man
It's insults, blackmail, what's up, what's up, what's up?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's a fashion order, it's a fashion order, it's a fashion order
Yes, I'm the king of it, a fashion order
What's up? What's up?
Prefer people to laugh at you when you are six feet under
Then you say, "God bless them"
Then I will say, "God bless them, they don't know what they are doing"
Make it, break it, make it, break it
Injustice, blackmail, insane, killings, apartheid
Lies, racism, discrimination, greed
Blackmail, biological import and cold war never ending
Intervention order
What the right to remain silence
Break it, break it, make it, break it
Break it, break it, make it, break it
Break it down, break it down
