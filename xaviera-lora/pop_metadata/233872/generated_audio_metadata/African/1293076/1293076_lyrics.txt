There's a place that I can go where no one else can follow
And when I need to be alone when I am feeling low
I cry a river of tears for all the people I've lost
My soul feels so bare, so many rivers I've crossed
This world and the next, goodness
When I'm drowning in a river of tears
I can feel them reaching out
They let me know they care
Can they quiet all my doubts?
I feel myself
Floating through the water
Gently guided by their hands
There are many unexpected turns
They help me softly land
Sometimes I feel left behind while
Others have gone to travel but
They are always in my mind
The river helps me to unravel
This world and the next, connect
When I'm drowning in a river of tears
I can feel them reaching out
They let me know they care
And they quiet all my doubts
I feel myself
Floating through the water
Gently guided by their hands
There are many unexpected turns
They help me softly land
At the serene river
I'll cross over that serene river
They will meet me at the river
