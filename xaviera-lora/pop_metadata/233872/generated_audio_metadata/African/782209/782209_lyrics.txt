Some people think I'm foolish, loving you my baby
Even my friends also think that I am crazy
Could not understand that the kind of love we're feeling
This kind of love surpasses understanding
Baby baby please don't let me down
Please don't let me down now
Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down
I guess you know I'm in love with you
And I know that you love me too
And we know that this love was meant to be forever
This is heaven's made yes God
See they can say what I wanna say
Said they can't even do what they wanna do
But you and I are meant to be forever
Till death do us part
Some people think I'm foolish loving you my baby
Even my friends also think that I am crazy
Could not understand that the kind of love we're feeling
This kind of love surpasses understanding
Baby baby please don't let me down
Please don't let me down now
Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down
Another form say I hold it fast
I'm feeling myself and I get mount
When I look into the mirror all I see is you
Who dis below, you driving me insane oh, oh be more, please don't let me down oh
Some people think I'm foolish loving you my baby
Even my friends also think that I am crazy
Could not understand that the kind of love we're feeling
This kind of love surpasses understanding
Baby baby please don't let me down
Please don't let me down now
Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down
I guess you know I'm in love with you
And I know that you love me too
I never let it be done
Da da da da da da
You leave me low (can't understand)
You're driving me insane (you're driving me insane)
Hope me more
Please don't let me down
