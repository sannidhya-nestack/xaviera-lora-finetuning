We remember on that day
We remember on that day
We remember on that day
Nightfall in Africa
We remember on that day
We remember on that day

Now I fuck in Africa
They remember on that day
We remember on that day

Now I fuck in Africa
They remember on that day

Now I fuck in Africa
Now I fuck in Africa
I said now I fuck in Africa
Now I fuck in Africa
Nothing in Africa
The rich get richer
The poor get poorer
High cost of living so high
Inflation rise everyday
Monkey they walk
Bambo they chop, I say
Monkey they walk, walk, walk
Bambo they chop, then they loot
Then they shoot, then they kill innocent people
They made their own homeless
Seventy thousand stateless have no home
They made their own homeless
Seventy thousand stateless have no home
Masame neni wo wo Afrika
