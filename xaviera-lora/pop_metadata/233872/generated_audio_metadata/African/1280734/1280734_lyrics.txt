If only you could
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
In time you may see what you wanted to be
Holding on to your soul until I take you home
What you want, you can have or what you need
You will become what you want
You can have or what you need
You will become what you want
If only you could, if only you could love yourself
If only you could, if only you could love yourself
If only you, if only you, if only you
If only you, if only you, if only you
If only you
If only you
You could
If only you could
If only you
If only you could, if only you could, if only you could
If only you could, if only you could, if only you could
If only you, if only you, if only you could
If only you, if only you, if only you could
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
