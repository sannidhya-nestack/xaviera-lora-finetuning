Firework
Don't know
Two white flakes
Sound good baby
It's two white crooks
Back in the days I was nobody
I was so broke got no money
I cannot take care of my family
So I travelled through the sea down to Italy
Make way for the small boy now we are getting big money
Make way
When I wake up one day and I look my mama face
After take a body pain with 34 for my eyes
So I have to make my own choice, eh-eh
Not to leave the ass, eh, uh-huh
I want down on my knees and she pray for me
Anything wanna do, I go prosper
And I never wanna go, I go conquer
Now so she talk calm
For me not to live the life of no regret
I have to put my life on the line
Wait till my eyes see my mouth not be talk calm, eh-eh
Wait till my eyes see my mouth not be talk calm, eh-eh
Back in the days I was nobody
I was so broke got no money
How can I take care of my family
So I travel through the sea down to Italy
Make way for the small boy now when I get the big money
Make way for the small boy now when I get the big money
Make way for the small boy now when I get the big money
Make way for the small boy now when I get the big money
A di hustle
Every night and day me now di fumble
And the stronger you are to make sure say you are double of the pain
Hey, see the money that they come make
All my dreams all they come true
Any year I go and they shut it down
