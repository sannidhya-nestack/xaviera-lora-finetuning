Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I, I, I, I
You married young, with high hopes, through lonely times, a love on the run, now I miss you, why did you go away, each one lives in the honor of the love they share, I hope and pray, through the day, you know I don't say, too much, thank you love
In morning and dusk (Morning and dusk, girl)
Making love in morning and dusk (Morning and dusks, girl)
Making love in morning and dusk (Morning and dusk, girl)
Making love in morning and dusk (Morning and dusk, girl)
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Making love in morning and dusk
Making love in morning and dusk
Making love in morning and dusk
Making love in morning and dusk
Making love in morning and dusk
Making love in morning and dusk (morning and dusk)
Making love in morning and dusk (morning and dusk)
Making love in morning and dusk (morning in dusk)
I, I, I, I, I
