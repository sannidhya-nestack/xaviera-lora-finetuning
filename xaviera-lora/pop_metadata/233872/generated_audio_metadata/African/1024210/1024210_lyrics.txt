Osmo Nella eno kumle
Nanyu money enke drubu
Money making no be easy
Money making no be easy
Enke osmo Nella eno kumle
Nanyu money enke drubu
Money making no be easy
Money making no be easy
So hold on hold on
Baby girl slow down
Woman woman
Won't you be my woman
So hold on hold on hold on hold on
Woman woman woman woman
Baby girl you got to slow down
Mwpe tu pwa wu siang
You will see blood
I can't take the pressure
I'm still young
All I want now is the peace in your love
Baby don't ask cause you know I don't have
Money be my problem cause I no be sad
Mwpe jamme house sake of money don't do that
You dey give me vibe nyeh sanka mi je wa
Mi passion mi ne obo birane to the end
Even though I'm broke but mi taste is for quench
Seh mi phone mwkru mpwa mkoto ju gu fem
Cause if you leave me ya wa gudi
Long time we a live you know you need to leave
Now you money incapable
Money making no be easy
Money making no be easy
In case money lay in no home lay
Now you money incapable
Money making no be easy
Money make it no be easy
So hold on hold on
Baby girl slow down
Woman woman
Won't you be my woman
So hold on hold on hold on hold on
Woman woman woman woman
Yeah, money making no be easy
Abura boy a heart, mi name is so easy
I wanna spend life with you, not my money
Looking for somebody but not any fucking body
When I say I love you, it comes from the heart
Me ndi say other rappers, omo ye by heart
Urewa him fi ho, ma wakuma cracks
Mi lejende dena wafifhe ofa usesna
Mi perso me ndi ubo birande ti de end
Even do I'm broke, ba me te si fokwenj
Se me fumo kwenpa, nko tujogo fem
if you leave me, ya wago did it long time
Boy I love you, you did it
Now you money ain't get rubble
Money make it no be easy
Money make it no be easy
In case money lay and no come lay
Now you money ain't get rubble
Money make it no be easy
Money make it no be easy
Meechta bheemzee
Zaram jee muze
Esa
I don't behave
