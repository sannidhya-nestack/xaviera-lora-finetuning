This is Soa, I'm an African man
I come from Nigeria in an African land
It's been long time me there in a European land
The land when they call that a German
The time when me there now, that's a dark one
Me tell you na me have and me dey call me that
Me is not a fool, me inna laugh
Me tell you for the minute, I'm not nice at all
One need fi struggle, that's what we have for us
But we here show dem say, we have the muscle
Not the muscle for us, but the muscle for us
Inna papillon hustle inna papillon
We say so I'm an African man
I come from Nigeria in an African land
The land that me be inna local land
The land we me call that Jah man
Take him to the UK
Though I might be half British
I'm full West Indian
Some of us needed paper so we can come to England
Just to run some errands and be on the earner
Cause the system will burn ya
Make you wanna flee all the way to California
I see many wanna leave the European dream
Though there's enough euros for all my people to eat
So welcome all to unbelievable street
Who ain't seen such world, heem as evil as these
So skating on thin ice, this ain't Torvald D
If I can't get the cake, I'm lacking sure of a piece
Just for me to come back and take all of the cream
Cause we got big things that make you always free and just jump, jump
Back where the west was one with the south
There was no black slaves in no white house
And our speech and spirits were free
Just like the breath from our mouth
A long time me there in a European land
A long time me there in a European land
And me know what I want
You see me?
To me?
Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump
This is so, I'm an African man
I come from Nigeria in an African land
The long time we there in a European land
The land where they call that, German
The time when we there and then, datadat
We play in a million and we get from the god
Me is not a fool, me inna law
I'm a player for the minute, I'm not nice at all
