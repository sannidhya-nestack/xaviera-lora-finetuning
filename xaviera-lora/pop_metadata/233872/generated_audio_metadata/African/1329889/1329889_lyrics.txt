The sun sets low, oh
Golden glow, oh
Your touch so warm, oh
It steals the show, oh
My heart beats fast
It starts to flow
To your rhythm
Oh
To your soul
I know
My heart dances to your rhythm
Every beat it feels like heaven
You and me we're in it's one
In your love I lose my mind
Soft whispers float, they fill the air
Your melody is everywhere
Every moment loves repair
In your arms, I have no care
My heart dances to your rhythm
Every beat it feels like heaven
You and me we're intertwined
In your love I lose my mind
Underneath the starlit sky
We'll keep moving you and I
Every note we're flying high
Forever love will never die
My heart dances to your rhythm
Every beat it feels like heaven
You and me we're intertwined
In your love I lose my mind
