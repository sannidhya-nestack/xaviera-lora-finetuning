I live my life like a superstar
On the stage, slamming my guitar
Girl, the way you are
I love the way you are
Big house over here
Know you're the only one that I breathe
I don't mind, stay on me
Doesn't seem friends, not even enemies
You and I
Mmm, only you and I
Mmm, you and I
You and I, only you and I
You and I, girl, yeah, you and I
Honey by the lakeside, lakeside
Then you show me the signs, got the signs, ah-ah
You and I, girl, yeah, you and i
Push your hands up like a dance pony that you, you
Party don't stop, everybody to the morning, morning, yeah
Started from the couch to the bed, now the floor
Bring nobody close, baby give me some more
Just wanna make love, baby I don't want more, no
Oh, live my life like a superstar
On the stage, slide me my guitar
Girl, the way you are, I love
The way you are, big house over here
Girl, you're the only one that I need
I don't mind a shadow of me
Dancing with friends, fighting with enemies
You and I
Mmm, only you and I
Mmm, you and I, you and I, only you and I
