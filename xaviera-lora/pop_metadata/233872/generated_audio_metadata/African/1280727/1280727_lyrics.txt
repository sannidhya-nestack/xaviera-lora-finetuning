Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no I don't need to
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I don't need to
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I was made for loving you
You know it's true
And I won't say this to you
Do you love, do you love me too?
I don't need to tell you
That I love you so
I don't need to say those words
I love you all the time
I love you all the time
Love you all the time
I love you all the time
Love you all the time
So I don't need to
I love you all the time, love you all the time
I love you all the time, love you all the time
I love you all the time, love you all the time
I love you all the time, love you all time
All the time, all the time, all the time
