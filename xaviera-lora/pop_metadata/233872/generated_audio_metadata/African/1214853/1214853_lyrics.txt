Find the strength within yourself
Align with high confidence
Embrace the magical light
Toss mute your fears into gold
Set the fire, let it burn (fire, fire)
Honest your strength, take flight
Believe the power within you (shine bright)
Let your spirit shine bright (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Like a nakamist
Yeah, yeah
Like a nakamist
Bring the change to your life
No heart has never ever suffered
When it comes to its dream
Hey
Every second of this search
In Canton we've got eternity
Yah yeh leh, yah yeh leh
Your heart whispered, be aware
Bring the change, be aware
Yah yeh leh, yah yeh le
Time to write your destiny, be aware
Be fearless, be aware
Yah yeh leh, yah yeh le
Yeah, like an alchemist
Yeah, yeah, like an alchemist
