Love is a gift from God
We're meant to love each other
Not to be afraid of loving each other
This is aimed up
This is aimed up
I don't wanna be afraid of loving you too much
I don't wanna be afraid of loving you too much
I want my mind to be free and stressed
Released by your love to my life
I want my mind to be free and stressed
Released by your love to my life
Talk to me, guess it's a delay when I'm a baby
Nguwewe Djonje
Talk to me ngizi tandela we nama baby
Nguwewe Djonje
Talk to me ngizi tandela we nama baby
Nguwewe Djonje
Talk to me is it Sunday or Wednesday my baby
Where my baby
My African woman
Yeah oh
Ange funugugwe saban to gaziyeti
Gizetane lawe na
I love you oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Yelele, yelele
Angeponugugwe saba ntongasiyeke
Wena weto, wena weto ye
Wena weto, wena weto
I don't wanna be afraid of loving you too much
When I wet down drip
I don't wanna be afraid of loving you too much
