Oh yahoo, I say lo-o-o-o-o-o-o (lo-o-o-o-o-o)
Oh yahoo, I say yaga
Oh yeah oh oh oh
I say oh oh oh
Oh yeah oh oh oh
I say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
What in the happen
Don't lose your mind
Get it down the route
Like a tree you're connected to the earth
That sits on the root
Kije, kije, kije, kije
Keep the light, be the light
Grounding magic through the earth
In the roots, not the branches
Keep the light, be the light
Listen to the wind
And the voice in your mind
Oya ho, ayi selo
Oya ho, ayi se gaga
Oya ho, ayi selo
Oya ho, ayi se gaga
Ageshe, ageshe
Keep the light, be the light
Keep the light, be the light
Keep the light, be the light
Keep the light, be the light (Yes, shine, yeah, for a reason)
Keep the light, be the light (Light will help you)
Keep the light, be the light (Shine, follow through this)
Keep the light, be the light (Yes, shine, yeah, for a reason)
Keep the light, be the light (Rise and shine)
Keep the light, be the light (Shine, follow through this)
