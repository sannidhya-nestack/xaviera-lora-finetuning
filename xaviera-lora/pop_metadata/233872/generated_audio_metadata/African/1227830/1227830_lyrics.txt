Oh my son, I love you, blefusani
What will I teach you, to help you survive?
Crazy and warody
For you
That's the way you keep your life in
Ngozi ili paliponse
Kumene unga pite
Every say of your descent
Mighty strike a heart in
Below
Oh my son
I love you
My brave son
Be on the safe side
When you travel life
Nizambil is all little
Kujogela kukangano
And this life live proudly my son
And hold your head higher
Don't turn it down
And run all over Kuku
Face the truth my son
Live life slow
My son
Remember my words
Fly free as a bird
Choose a noble cause
Breathe with your heart
Don't you break any law
Think twice and be smart
Ogunbo kilama uanga
Atatonu kanga kimbalambe
I love you my sonny
Pagana kale kale
Ndiwe mwana wanga
Olimba ntima
Be on the subsiding when you travel life
This ambil is all illiterate, ujjoke la kukanganu
And this life is living proudly my son
And hold your head higher don't turn it down
And run all over you
Face the truth, my son, living life's long
Be on the safe side when you travel life
Disambilizolilita, yokele kokanganu
End this life, live proudly, my son
End it, hold your head higher, don't turn it down
End it, run all over
Face the truth my son, living life's too long, my son
My son
