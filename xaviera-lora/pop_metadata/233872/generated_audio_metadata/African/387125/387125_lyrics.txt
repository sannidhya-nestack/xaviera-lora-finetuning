Uprooted
Forced to leave a native location
To destroy or remove completely
Murda me roots and the murda me brother me

Murda me roots and the murda me brother me
All because of we are black men

We Sir President just on your TV

We worship Yoruba
They made us follow Jesus
Picking all this cottony
Barely feed us
Built half of this nation
They acting like they don't need us
Yeah they cheat us
Now I'm sitting in prison with cousin Cletus
Moms is on welfare
Pops was never there
I wish I was just chilling in my village of Zaire
I was born in the hood
So I love my block
I think she loves me
Oh no she loves me not
Turn on your television
And what do you see?
People like you not like me
Handcuffed with cameras all in my grill
They want the world to feel sorry for the man that I killed
They ain't tell you that he raped my sister, raped my mother
Killed my grandparents and sold my brother
Yeah we came a long ways from slavery
And God I appreciate all the things you gave to me
What I can't help but admit lately I've been feeling strange
This is the way you made me now you want me to change
My pants are too baggy, suits ain't tight enough
I can speak
But my voice ain't wide enough
Sisters are leaving us
Say they want a better life
Bitch leave now
Cause I need a better wife
It sounds strife
But the truth is strong
Girl should've left my roots alone
Talk to em
Murder me roots and then murder me brother man
I'll be cut soft
We are black men
Murder me roots and then murder me brother man
I'll be cut soft
We are black men (oh)
They might treat we with a brutality (hey)
All because of we are the TT (oh)
They might treat we with a brutality (hey)
All because of we are the TT
In God we trust, the devil we burn (hey)
In God we trust, the devil we burn (why)
Fire I go burn down Babylon (hey)
In God we trust, the devil we burn (hey)
In God we trust, the devil we burn (why)
Fire I go burn down Babylon (hey)
Oh aye
Murder me roots and they murder me brother me
All because of we are black men
Murder me roots and they murder me brother me
All because of we are black men
They might treat we with a brutality
All because of we are the TT
They might treat we with a brutality
All because of we are the TT
