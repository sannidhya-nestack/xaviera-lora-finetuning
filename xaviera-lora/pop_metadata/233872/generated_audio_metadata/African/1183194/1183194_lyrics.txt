Under your moonlight
Under your moonlight
Under your moonlight
Under your moonlight
Like a thief in the night
Beautiful surprise delight
Like a pool of river sea
She took my heart away
She has the beauty of the sun
The smile of a star
Lounge in solitude
The joy of a child
She's a lover, perfect fighter
She's a giver, perfect keeper
She's a thinker, perfect lawyer
She's a dreamer, perfect liar
She's a lover, perfect fighter
She's a giver, perfect keeper
She's a thinker, perfect lawyer
She's a dreamer, perfect liar
She doesn't need to talk
The missing puzzle found
Her body language, it says it all
She is the boss
She has the beauty of the sun
The smile of a star
Lounge in solitude
The joy of a child
She's a lover, perfect fighter
She's a giver, perfect keeper
She's a thinker, perfect lawyer
She's a dreamer, perfect liar
She's a lover, perfect fighter
She's a giver, perfect keeper
She's a thinker, perfect lawyer
She's a dreamer, perfect liar
She's a lover, perfect fighter
She's a giver, perfect keeper
She's a thinker, perfect lawyer
