This to the self acclaimed judges
Judging people by the past
It's time for you to know what time it is
Cause all your evidence are memories
That day when I was a kid
And I was still remember all the things I did
Mama took me and I supplied my needs
Born in Rasta man so I paint them with
Now this a new me
I wake all night cause I wanna succeed
Yeah, I think you feelin' me, like painting by my past, so mi-di mi-ding
Today was yesterday's tomorrow, and today can never be another tomorrow
Let's focus on the future and let the past go
Mi-hon se ma-mo ke kenya ya pasco
Ma-di mu-kane ya mu-yati, mi-hon se mu-na mo ke kan wuviasa ba ya kana
Nasa wene me ya fanya ma-infe ki na ma-chi wuviye de ya deno ya ya wuye
Kwa so kana wubiye nte, kwa so ma-pasa meta manatindi
Into my memories
All I can see is
The mind changing
Everyday is a new day and
Everyday is a new me
So for me it feel judgment
But my past is just memories
We don't take commands from anyone
We just take advice
And we move on
Ya menyam machine
Wabe control
To dem susupon
Fire burn you up
You say we could never make it, we made it and now you are hating
My hair, my breath, my mind rested
Who told me I would be an unknown to the unknowing
I'm innocent, me a clean to serve virgin
Me knew my pointy, my dog from year dozen
You can't be in my bedding, I'm receiving the blessing
Every day, every night so I'm still winning
What we went through yesterday I made theirs today
Obra menya inti nenu mi jipe
E nona ashe me dobe kaye mi bad case
Fi vibe on it
Fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire
When I think deep (when I think deep)
Into my memories (you know)
All I can see is (all I can see is)
The man changing (changing)
Every day is a new day and
Every day is a new me (every day is a new me)
So call me if you judge me by my past
It's just memories (memories, memories, memories)
Yah
Let's spend down the Babylon
One time you know
Let's burn all their evidence
their memories
We vibe on it
Hahaha
Village
Let's go easy easy baby
