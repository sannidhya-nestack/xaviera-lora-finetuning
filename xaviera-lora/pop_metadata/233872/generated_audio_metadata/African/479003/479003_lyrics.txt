I will see you, I will see you, I will see you, yeah, in eterno, forever, milele, I will see you, I will see you, yeah, timilele, saaz ingine inabidi kuti express
In a crazy town, in a crazy time
It's you and me together, oh
Weekends come, and the weekends go
It's a little like ourselves
We can fall in love, we can have a girl
If you and me together, yeah
We can trip around this crazy town
It's a little like a sad house
So many nights mi ku wish ku take flight baka kuwa stars
So many scars ku moyo so many bars
Ni meru white as in hippie feeling ya song ni ta fall in love na yo
Kama ye ki pusa hi ni kama dry spell ya sanaa
Ni ka kama sah baka exile toka mitaa
Min am cheesy black tu kamua ku funga safari ku lay low kuwa small town
Maybe ita turn kuwa small eden
Maybe then, hisuaili ita flow kama jia chumvi pwani
Dimpos na smiles, tuki crown mamalkia
Ase black ni nahisiya
Sometimes, rhymes si enough
Hatay ko inspada, bitter sweet tears a solomos minds
Empaku akami, who desire?
Hitaji, Empress Divine
Did I mention how much I'm into you?
Wanna crawl under the covers, yeah
Wanna sing a song to you the whole night long
It's the story of ourselves
I want to talk to you in a dive or two
But like eleven hours on
Play our little games
You know we're not ashamed
To be exactly like ourselves
I will hold your hand
Nimi inna way, I love you more than life, heaven, earth knows
You mesmerize my whole, I owe you tons mami
We are caught up in a web, Karongo and Juliet
This is love matrix, so tired of the ups and downs
We are bridging the challenges, kidole moja uwi chawa
Pa moja tuko poa, la vie tu ni powa
Na flex kila muscle, angel you own the castle of my soul
Caught up in the crossroads
Your love stands out of the crowd
Withstanding the test of time
More than diamond
Your love is forever and eternal
Rome and rule my jungle
Adore your loudness
Thank you for making me a man
Sharing with me
Your only holy cup of love
Like Dezibel
You are the unit of my heartbeat
Let the many stars in the skies
Be a symbol of our future generation to come
I shall never let you down
Sweetness, you're a legacy
I will see you there when I will hold your hand
Chase the Nami Ma
