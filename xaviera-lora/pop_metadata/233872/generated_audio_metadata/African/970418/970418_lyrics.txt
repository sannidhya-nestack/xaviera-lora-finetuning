I'm talking money for the type that knows it (what's up)
Sab che kribu a kamido, faote ye ke mudu muribu a kapito
You don't understand, ma niga fare lisa
The heavier it gets, ma niga fare risa
Sugar mama zbaba to ruweza
I'm so confused, le re na harmesa
Well I guess you bruised, you don't know how to feta
Eta me eta re nesa fare lisa
Hey nigga now put that round sign, hand that round sign

Like a pitbull I'm viewing
This punk tryna jump my gate
He sees me I'm drooling
Using my gift the aim is not losing
Press up on the phone I push out I blooming
Like poetry my brain is oozing
Back in the days I was scared of women
On a random day cooling
Not fooling I'm doing
Hip hop so amusing
Come doozing
Real mood ruling
Grand shop like it's a biggie booling
Met up with this chick pooling
Forced me to get married and doozing
So I ran all the way to Spokane
Just to see my Takane Jose
Knock knock at Takane Odeng
Well she's with this other boy Kokone
Now with us they leave me making it
We end up rojerele matate
When I get there onale somebody
Unpoza di tori like tell me I'm sorry
I was like one yana wapidori
Are you dumping me for this guy Gallory
Got no sound (got no sound)
Subject ribu a kamino
Faute e ke mudu muru a kapito
You don't understand, my nigga fareleza
The heavier it gets, my nigga fareleza
Sugar mama's baba to ruweza
I'm so confused, le re na harimesa
Well I guess you bruised, you don't know how to feta
Eta meta re nesa fareleza
Sab che kribu a kamino
Fawzeye ke mudu murugu a kapiko
You don't understand my nigga fareleza
The heavier it gets my nigga farereza
Sugar mama's baba toruweza
I'm so confused le re na harimesa
Well I guess you bruised you don't know how to fitza
Eta me eta re ne safare neta
Think you backpump my lifestyle
Ke khole te kharangua yabua
Skansoka kha geruga
Din to di ru kehe kha diluga
Being that gentleman
Bringing that sentiment
I'm for, shen and against
You know how we settle it
Girls fell in love with this
So better be a better man
Better man
Every time I rhyme there's a new tone
Every time I rhyme there's a new tone
Every time I dance I'm in my zone
Every time I rap I be like it's known
I'm best cause I'm best I'm alone
You can't compare this cause I'm prone
If you want the best you're my nigga phone
I'm just a nigga I'll kill the foe
Sab che crebu a camino
Faotei eke mudu muribu a capito
You don't understand my nigga fareleza
The heavier it gets my nigga farereza
Sugar mama's baba to the weta
I'm so confused, le re na har me sa
Well I guess you bruised, you don't know how to feta
Eta me eta re ne safa re neta (no, no, no)
Leta (gatti go south)
Weta (leta)
Feta (gatti go south)
I be cold, I be cold, I be cold, I be cold, I be cold, I be cold, I be cold, I be cold
