Sao pa sao hete
But we need source of power
Oto basi besome
Me mawa hete
Close my eyes and realize that I daydream
A strange voice called my name
Iyem kimi brim
Who is there, show your face
I see I start to scream
It talk plenty tense
E dasone na mi trim
Like I'd give the world if you bow to me
Like I'd open your eyes and also set you free
The grand mix the beat this all belongs to me
If you give me your soul, you have them for free
Cause like, penultra, enda, ubebre
I ain't a girl, inti jai mea fre fre
God deem aside, inti means resre
He gave me this talent so he will make me blow
You just won't deceive me cause you already know
You lucky say you be spirit like you go chop blow
I'm not far for your tricks cause I know say you be test
I'll patiently wait cause God's time is the best oh yes
Nga uke kanya don't lie
Menomu what more lie
Nya okey kan ye don't lie
Me wa big guy, inti don't try
Nya uki kanya don't lie
Meno me want more life
Nya uki kanya don't lie
Me wa beg God
Inti don't try
No prayer
24 /7
I just want your service for life
So be my brethren
What you dey want?
Eternal life
We gon' get it
et the school
Nye jumanu
Besin ko jame
I'll go give you money
Everything
Make you a star
Masa minim de wo peda dati
You don't have to mention
This be the real world
et the heaven
You cry, you de talk too much (too much)
For we dey we know dey do slow
God be the reason why we dey grow
Don't allow devil to deceive you
So my paddy shine your eyes
I say my paddy shine your eyes
Nya uke kanya don't lie
Me no me want more lie
Nya uki kanya don't lie
Me wa beg God inti don't try
Nya uki kanya don't lie
Me no me want more lie
Nya uki kanya don't lie
Me wa beg God inti don't try
Saw pe saw hete
But we need source of power
Oto basi besome
Me ma wa hete
Saw pe saw hete
But we need source of power
Boto basi besome
Me mawa hete
Nya uki kanya don't lie
Me no me want more lie
Nya uki kanya don't lie
Me wa beg God inti don't try
Nya uki kanya don't lie
Me no me want more lie
Nya uki kanya don't lie
Me wa beg God inti don't try
Saupe saupe hete
But we need source of power
Votu wasi sumyame
Abema wahete
