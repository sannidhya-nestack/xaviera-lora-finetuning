I see the vibe, I know my type of kind, to stick around
I've learned to read the signs
I've been through hell
I'm breaking free
Protect my energy
I got my power back
Rising higher
I found my own endeavor
I'm standing tall
I'm wearing my crown
Oh oh oh oh
From my own voice now I am speaking out loud
Swag ring high wise they'll be dog and proud
From my own voice now I am speaking out loud
Swag ring high wise they'll be dog and proud
Now I feel light
No longer held back
I've come so far
No longer in place
I can't breathe
I'm finally free
Protect my energy
I get my power back
Rising higher
I found my own endeavor
I'm standing tall
I'm wearing my crown
Found my own voice
Now I am speaking out loud
Swag ring high wise
Stay little and proud
Now I feel like my own voice
Now I am speaking out loud
Swag ring high wise
Stay little and proud
Stay little and proud
Finally free
