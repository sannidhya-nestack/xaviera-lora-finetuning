Malipo hapa hapa dunyana yetu miisare kuwandiko kwa bidi lazima italipa
MCK modang wapa hapa jamwani hisanaena itamini kuhakika
Ka huu di tena, kile kuzungu ka huu di tena
What goes around comes around, what goes around comes around, comes around, comes around
Come on, come on
Oman kane, Oman kane, Oman kane
Woman, I'm a sticko inside my sun machine
Woman, you're talking'bout is drama
Woman, I'm a sticko inside my sun machine
It's the rights we're all put through
It's the question of being true
I'm afraid in your mind, I'm so, so, so real
MCK, I'm back again
All the things you do, I do them all, I'm a Kite, I bring it here
No one can stop me, I'm eating honey, you and your family
Shikambogo, Magidi, Katia, Nuka
Journey of love is like a train
My eyes are closed, my ears are open, why is it now suffering?
Wala uta kanyaga uki pandangazi
Kumbuka uki shuka wata kucheka hadagwani
Respect respect
Binadamu na ratili si umasikia uta jiri
Wali yotini wotu jenga
Uki wafanyi wata kufanyia one day one one
Rise and fall
Usunguka vile karma sa ye reni sa ye reni sa ye reni
I'm on my misdream
I'm on my misdream
I'm on my misdream
I'm all, I'm in this dream
Oh man I gotta stay cool inside my summer
Oh man I gotta stay cool inside my summer, skin
Talkin'bout is all this drama
Only but it's the noise in my stomach, skin
It's the rights we're all put through
It's the question of being true
Rating my mind I'm so, so, so, real
