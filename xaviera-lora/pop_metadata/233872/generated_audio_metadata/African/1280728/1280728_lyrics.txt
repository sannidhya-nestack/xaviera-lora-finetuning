Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Below the waterfalls where we can play
We can finally both see on this bright day, yeah
Yeah, I know this place where love is real
I like the light of this thunderbolt, yeah
You won't regret what you do for love
What you do for love
You won't regret what you do for love
What you do for love
You won't regret what you do for love
What you do for love
You won't regret what you do for love
What you do for love
You won't regret
Do for love
What you do, yeah
What you do, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
You won't regret what you do for love, what you do for love, what you do for love, what you do for love
