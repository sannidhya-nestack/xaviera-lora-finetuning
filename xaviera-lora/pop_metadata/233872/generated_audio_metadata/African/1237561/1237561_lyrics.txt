I feel really lucky to have you in my life
I think a lot of people
Would kill to have a friend like you
This is a Hitmakers4life production
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
If you looked upon my woman then you looked upon my everything
If you touch my woman then it's anything or anything
I'm bringing all the things that you can never bring
But she give me stress because I know if you give her wedding ring
Take time, know I've got a good plan
You always have a good time'cause you're with a good man
And I'll be honest with you babe
I ain't really done this before but it should bang
Got me switching up the lifestyle
I ain't even gotta tell you that my life's wild
It's kinda hard for me to listen and to pipe down
All it took for you to make me do it was a nice smile
Got me way up in the motherland
You and I together have the upper hand
There's many things that I can understand
But there's no excuse if I see you with another man
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She staying with me now that's why she got the crown
She always had my back when I was underground
She was looking for the loving but it wasn't found
Told her I can give you that and more when I run the town
Now she forever staying loyal to me
She was looking good but now she looking royal to me
I gotta confess when I'm stressed I know it's blessed
Cause she gonna come and rub my back with oil for me
And we can have a hell of a time
And I love it when you tell me I'm ahead of my time
And when you let me come examine your head
Oh my god what a hell of a man
You know that makes me happy and you like that
Don't be stressing when I leave I'll be right back
If you're wearing what I like you know I'm mad tight
And if you wanna take it back you know I'll back back
Oh, oh, oh
You're always there for me, and I'll always be there for you.
