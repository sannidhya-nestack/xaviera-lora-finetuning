Happiness, happiness, happiness
You on the rise and see them tryna pull us down
Why in a war form now, why in a war zone?
Happiness, we that
On the road to success
So I got bunch of haters
They tryna put me down but I ain't give it up
I get my eye on my pay verse
No matter what haters gonna do
Get a youth I ain't give it up
The blood wash but we pursue
We come from fire so we heat up
No matter what haters gonna do
Get a youth I ain't give it up
The blood wash but we pursue
We come from fire so we heat up
No matter what it is gonna do
Gather youth and give it up
The good works by passion
It come from fire so we heat up
