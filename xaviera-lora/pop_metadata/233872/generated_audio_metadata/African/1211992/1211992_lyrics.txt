I'm a rockstar, I just wanna rock with you my whole life
I'm gon' trade my life for fame and change my name
I'm not a gangsta, my energy keeps moving
Rockstar
I just wanna rock with you my whole life
I'm gon' trade my life for fame
And change my name
I'm not a game star
My energy keeps moving
Let's run and hide
Do the things we gotta do
Just you and me
With a credit card that's got no limit on it
Private jets with a petromi name
With a king size two part
Big enough for us
I just wanna rock like that
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Let's have some fun
Let's be alright
Let's grab some bottles bottles
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm a rockstar
I just wanna rock with you my whole life
I'm gon' trade my life for fame
And change my game
I'm not a game star
My energy keeps moving
Rockstar
I just wanna rock with you my whole life
I'm gon' trade my life for fame
And change my game
I'm not a game star
My energy keeps moving
I'm so cool
I'm so smooth, I'm tattooed, I'm so fresh
Do the playboy dance, put your hands in the air
B-Barizuna, let's feel alright
It's how I'm living my life
Living like I'm a rockstar
I just wanna be your ride
I'm a rockstar
I just wanna rock with you my whole life
I'm gon' trade my life for fame
And change my name
I'm not a gangsta
My energy keeps moving
It's LC the Beat God
