Mmm, way, way, way, way, way, way
Way, way, way, way, way, way
Way, way, way, way, way, yeah
Woah, I could be something all the time (Yeah, Wambie, you can be)
I could be something in this mind (Put your mind to it, uh-huh)
I could be something endlessly (Uh-huh)
I could be something
I could be something and I could see something all the time (Nezahona, you can see)
I could see something in the sky
And I could see something on the sea
I could see something
I could see something
Beliefless, car, high-torch, endless potential
Nazima Negassi Basi
Nago Deep, Kwasi Potri, Kufri
Slaves' talency, lifting soul, poverty obviously
Killer time, me na killer rhyme
Kofu again is bleed ya dime
MCK something
In fact everything na shine is pokua bling bling
Ambition si o crime deep si na go deeper
Bila flippers na shika crowd ka soka ni ite gold keeper
Deeper kam kono ya choko skwa peeper
Kitap tradish kwa scene city ya ma sweeper
Sip liquor zika cream creeper
MC kana shika microphone kwatisha
Ma wisdom seekers na zahiliya peeper
Bilges misotage ya wezi lipa
Fitu kama emperor, rule kings
Oh I could be something all the time
I could be something in this rhyme
And I could be something endlessly
I could be something
I could be something
And I could see something all the time
I could see something in the sky
And I could see something on the sea
I could see something
I know I can be what I wanna be, honestly, penye niya kununenjiya dreams infinity
Consciousness bilavi kwazo nazidi kukamua nime tia bidiye
Barabara ndefi safari baridi indania concrete jungle siasa ni jangwa
Kudulea machu zawadi na baraka toka jari nime hustle teari nime make it
Katia odds otte
Ngo u si mwa na harakati, ithi nga kati inga wa swords iko drone crossroad wa muzi ni wako na waza kuwa tchotote nita kacho
Tini ya juwa u si blink ata sekunde maisha poka pata potea panda na kushuka fita joka tini ya meza
Nimi ya mua kuwa nyota angaza ardhi na sayari
Ogelia nami izi ni me pusa flow one two for my people mtaami
Oh don't you start now
Hold my hand
Won't you let me take you with me
All my life I've waited for you
Whoa, way, way, way, way, way, way
Oh, I could be something all the time
I could be something in this rhyme
I could be something endlessly
I could be something
I could be something and I could see something all the time
I could see something in the sky
I could see something on the sea
I could see something
I could see something, yeah yeah
You can be, neza kuwa, uh huh (I can see something now)
Chichote, uh huh (I can see something now)
Put your mind to it, uh huh (I can see something now)
Neza ona
You can see, uh-huh, tell'em (I could see something)
I could see something
