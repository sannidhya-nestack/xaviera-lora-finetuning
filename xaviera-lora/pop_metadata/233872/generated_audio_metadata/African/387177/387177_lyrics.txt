The way she moving, the sexy feeling
Just rock this party
Girl move your body, hey
Hold up, wait a minute

Hold up, wait a minute

Stepped in the party eyes all low
You's the first thing I saw whining so slow
You impressed me take my hand
Escort me to the back of the club now
One two rip the down tile
Your booty got the question my dick got the answer
Your man wild out then my gun go block out
Hold up let me wild with my niggas
Relax no beef see that broad grabber
Niggas wanna walk while we got six swagger
To the floor make sure she don't flex you
After the club maybe I might sex you
Until then just rock this party
Girl go ahead and move your body
Until then just rock this party
Girl go ahead and move your body
The sexy feeling
Just rock this party

The way she moving
The sexy feeling
Just rock this party
Girl move your body, hey
