Alright, dragon, some music
I can't stand no lies
I can't stand no more fake friends
Oh woah
You're getting in my nerves
I can't deal with you no more
You better not lie when you getting close to me
Trust in me I will be alright if you stay away from me
You better not lie when you getting close to me
Be positive and we'll be alright
Maybe not today or tomorrow, you know
But if I'm jelly, the lies you tell gonna trip you up
Personally, I like to watch a liar stumble upon themselves
Lies, no lies
Lies, no lies
Lies, no lies
Lies, no lies
Me no say man on mix man
That's why me never wanna see them close enough
It's a mad town
And people don't drink from the truth jar no more
Brother tell me what a gwan with the fakeness
Sister tell me what a gwan with the fakeness
Tell me what a gwan with the lies
We be spreading man on mix man
That's why me never wanna see them close enough
It's a mad town
People don't drink from the truth jar, oh no more
Brother, tell me what that one with the fakeness
Sister, tell me what that one with the fakeness
Tell me what that one with the lies should be spreading
Maybe not today or tomorrow you know
But eventually the lies you tell gonna trip you up personally
I like to watch the liars stumble over themselves
No lies, no lies, no lies, no lies, no lies, no lies, no lies, no lies, no lies, no lies
