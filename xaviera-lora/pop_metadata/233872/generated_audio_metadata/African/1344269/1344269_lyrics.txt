Oh oh yeah yeah if I do, I'm here again oh
Oh yeah nah nah, it's I'm here again
Blessings for my way
We no fi complain (no complain) oh complain
We live everyday
We know the door low
Sunshine on my face
I dey carry joy go
Life no get replay
So I gots to let it show
We live everyday

See the life on my eyes
Now the fire where they burn inside
Every step I they take
Try to guide I they testify
Small small wins still sweet like champagne
Every setback I rise I they dance off the pain
No wahala
Love deh scatter, redeem deh gather
Energy deh flow like water, sweet pasamala
Tell my people stand strong, better days ahead
We deh live this moment like say we know deh fear regret
Oh oh oh

Eh eh eh eh eh eh
Joy deh follow me worldwide (worldwide)
Oh oh oh

Sunshine on my face
A dekari joy go
Life no get replaced
So I guess to let it show
We live every day
We live every day
Life's sweet when you share it with your people, oh
Smile's big when you chase dreams and you see it grow
Steady stepping, no shaking, we dey break through
Even when rain fall, joy still dey break through
Hands up make we fly high together
Vibes strong make we turn up forever
Every voice in the crowd let it elevate
Now today we dey leave, we go celebrate
Eh eh (ah ah)

Sunshine on my face (sunshine on my face)
Adekadi joy go (joy go)
Life no get replaced so I guess to let it show (let it show)
