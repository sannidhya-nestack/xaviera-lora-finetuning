I've been living my life, all the things that I've been told
Call it kind of neat
Crazy for wanting more, put my vision on lock
Pushing without no limits, minding my own business
This thing to be the greatest yeah
I believe in me so much without a doubt behind the mic
I met them off into a gar
Working hard for the paper
Let me tell you I'm on it
Revolution in mind
Something hard to define
To the future I'm tested while manifesting
The best in me having faith in what's meant to be
Though it's never that clear to see
Truly stand for your vision
With heart and commitment
Yes it gets hard but at the end you winning
I've been living my life on the things that I've been told
Called the kind of names crazy for wanting more
Put my vision on lock pushing without no limits
Minding my own business destined to be the greatest yeah
All I need is a microphone put my words in it
Let the beat bang save my soul yeah
See I've been working hard way before
A youngin shine get the bread niggas out the door
Grandma told me to quit
My sister told me to quit
Everybody told me to quit
They never trusted the dream
Nobody sees your vision
That's something gotta believe
Everybody watches the game
The aim, bottle your team, damn
The only way a nigga know his way up (his way up)
The only way a nigga know his way up (way up)
The only way a nigga know his way up, way up, way up, way up (way up, way up, way up)
The only way, the only way (way up, way up, way up, way up)
A nigga know his way up (way up, way up, way up)
Way up (way up, way up, way up)
Way up (way up, way up, way up)
Yeah (yeah, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
