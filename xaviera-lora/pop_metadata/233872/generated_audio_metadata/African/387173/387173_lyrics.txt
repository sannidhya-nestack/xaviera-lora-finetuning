We worship Yoruba they made us follow Jesus
Picking all this cotton and you fuckers barely feed us
Built half of this nation, they acting like they don't need us
Yeah they cheat us, now I'm sitting in prison with cousin Cletus
Moms is on welfare, pops was never there
I wish I was just chilling in my village of Zaire
I was born in a hood, so I love my block
I think she loves me, oh no she loves me not
Turn on your television and what do you see?
People like you, nah, niggas like me
Handcuffed with cameras, all in my grill
They want the world to feel sorry for the man that I killed
They ain't tell you that he raped my sister, raped my mother
Killed my grandparents and sold my brother
Yeah we came a long ways from slavery
And God I appreciate all the things you
What I can't help but admit lately I've been feeling strange
This is the way you made me now you want me to change
My pants are too baggy, suits ain't tight enough
I can speak proper but my voice ain't wide enough
Sisters are leaving us, say they want a better life
Well bitch leave now cause I need a better wife
It sounds strife but the truth is strong
You fuckers should've left my roots alone
Talk to'em
Muna me roots and the murda me brother me
I be Kosov we are black men
Murder me routine then murder me brother man
All because of we are black men
They might treat we with a brutality
All because of we are the NTT
They might treat we with a brutality
All because of we are the NTT
In God we trust, the devil we burn (hey)
In God we trust, the devil we burn (oh aye)

In God we trust, the devil we burn (Oh aye)
Fire I go on down Babylon (hey)

All because of we are the TT
