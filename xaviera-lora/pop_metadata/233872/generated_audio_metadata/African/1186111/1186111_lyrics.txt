Above all
Love each other deeply
Because love
Overthrows
A multitude of sins
Hip hop, alaye, alaye-o, alaye-e, alaye-o, alaye-e
Hip hop, alaye-e alaye-e, alaye-e
Hip hop, alaye-e alaye-e-o
Alaye-e alaye-e-o
Alaye-e alaye-e-o
Alaye-e alaye-e-o
It's so beautiful
All we have to do
Take care of it
No fight
No difference of colors
Black or white, we are the same people
If I hold my hand, hold me back
Hope I can feel my heart, love me back
If I, don't you know, we got the same blood
If I hold my hand, hold me back
Hope I can feel my heart, love me back
Oh, don't you know
We all like the rainbow, oh (Alaihiye, alaihiye, alaihiye, alaihiyo)
We all like the rainbow, oh (Alaihiye, alaihiye, alaihiyo)
Peace and love, oh don't you know
We all like the rainbow
I like you
