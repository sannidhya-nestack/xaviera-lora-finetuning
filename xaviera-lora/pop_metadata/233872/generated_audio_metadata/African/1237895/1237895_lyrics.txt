Be able to turn your wheel and never take it back
Umoyo o panda ufulu
Feels like a body with no soul
Ufulu, ufulu, ufulu
Hey, hey
Open the window to the sunlight
To the sunlight
Human spirit, dignity
Inspite the love that lives
Expite the thoughts that enslave your mind
Freedom
You were born to be free
Oh na na (freedom)
Yeah yeah yeah (freedom)
You must be free (freedom)
You got the key (you got the key)
Deep inside (freedom)
Oh na na na (freedom)
You must be free (freedom)
You got the key (you got the key)
Freedom, we found freedom when we found God
The divine within, oh fool, hey yeah yeah
Inspite the love that lives
Inspite the thoughts that enslave your mind
Freedom, you were born to be free
Oh na na (freedom)
Carry on with all my (freedom)
Do not take it back (freedom)
Freedom, you must be free (freedom)
Freedom, you got the key (freedom)
The all essence (freedom)
Of this world (freedom)
Freedom, you got the key
Freedom, freedom
