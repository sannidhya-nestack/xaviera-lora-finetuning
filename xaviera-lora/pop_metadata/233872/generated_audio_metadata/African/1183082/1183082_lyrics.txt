There is a voice inside of me crying
Tired of being so so long silent
Tired of these human beings, tired of me
Time to break this human chain
Spell on me
It's time to unleash the dragon
Dragon inside of me
Dragon
Dragon inside of me
Feels like
Tip tip diddly dip inside of me
Burning like
Tip tip diddly dip
Tip tip diddly dip inside of me
There is a voice inside of me
Burning
Tire of being so so long
Ignoring
Tired of this energy
Draining me
Time to break this family's
Curse on me
It's time to unleash the dragon
Dragging inside of me
Dragging, dragging inside of me
Feels like dip dip diddly dip
Dip dip diddly dip inside of me
Burning like
Dip dip diddly dip
Dip dip diddly dip
Inside of me
Burning like
You cannot hide the gold
In the ground for eternity
Drunk again
Drunk again
Soul Dragon
