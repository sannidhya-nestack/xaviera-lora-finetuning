Staring at you hoping you'd look back
But you ain't even think twice
I'm standing wondering why
Took off without even saying goodbye
Angaka tremye
Nwado ka bi bitremye
I wanna know
You promise me why you dey do me so
Girl I'm so cold
Yeah I'm too cold
Baby real cold
Unimsewo beye mi seya
Adey nawan kan treme
Unimsewo di mi besi heya
Adey nawan kan treme
To me you were the one
I no go lie you were second to none
Baby I seen you now wonder who the kind
I met phone girls
I met card girls
But wonder where you're dying
I can't man make people so high
Make people so high
Who the matching so I feel worse sign
So what was the issue
All I did was just to please you
And girl you know I really need you
Are you coming back now? Are you coming right now? Like you never left now?
You say I do like my hairstyle, you applaud anytime I freestyle
Those days were really special, yeah babe
You told me you would stay to the end
Stop with all the sweet words, like I'm heaven sent
Un nemse obeye mi seya (seya)
Adenawan kan tremi (mi hu hu)
Un nemse o demi besi heya (heya)
I think no one can trap me
Why you do me so
Why you do me so girl
Why you do me so
I think no one can trap me
Why you do me so
Why you do me so girl
Why you do me so
I think no one can trap me
Why you do me so
Why you do me so girl
Why you do me so
I think no one can trap me
I still love you though
We used to go swimming every Friday
Saturdays we shopping like it was your birthday
Homewood to a special baby it's a Sunday
Told me that I was the special thing in your life
And you can't wait to be my wife
But now I know
Unimsewo beye mi seya (seya)
Ade nawan kan tremi (hu, hu)
Unimsewo di mi besi heya (heya)
Ade nawan kan tremi
Unimsewo beye mi seya (Seya)
Ade na wan kan tre mi
Nguni mse o di mi besi heya
Ade na wan kan tre mi
Nguni mse o be ye mi seya
Ade na wan kan tre mi
Nguni mse o di mi besi
Ade na wan kan tre mi
