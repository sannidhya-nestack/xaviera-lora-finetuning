Swim me right over my feet now
Kiss me right, let me ride, only you know
Dream me right, hold me tight now
Don't let go, don't lose control
I've lost what you made me feel
Now when it's sent I want you off my skin
Kissing a fool and now our love's on a par
How do I live without a half of my heart?
Treat me the right way
Don't let me die here alone
If I'm lost in this space
You'll be my N-A-S-A
Oh that's what you made me feel
Now when it's sent I'll wash you off my skin
Kissing a fool and now our love's in a pot
How do I live without a half of my heart
Oh, that's what you made me feel
Now when it's time to wash you off my skin
Kissing a fool, now our love's in a pot
How do I live without a half of my heart?
