Hey, it's nothing I ain't done will give you life every day
Tell the bitch remember cock a love none on her way
You rather leave him alone
Oba, sega, suile, sega, suile
Nubut, bitch one denge snah ain't over, denna gana money bubble
Eda, Twini, Seda
Keep on trying, tell your bloody enemies to step aside
Seda, Swede, Seda, Swede
Nuhu, nene swaga pungu ngoba ena ganam zanibame
Eda, Twini, Seda
Keep on trying baby, kela noja is on your side
Just keep your head and your back shoveled
Nawe uye pona nade mungu lose it's structure
Nana mante ya echa glama danga sana wazile
Batches ya wadina ngoba slala sija bolina
Ya ya
Lama bonga sordu jawu spegila
Ya we never case no buta jagada spesila
I will keep on trying kada zela base machela
Habase krakeni nama nene ezipekela
Well again, shoot up, ayy
Akaifun yi dai den, shoot up, ayy
Akaitan yi dai den, shoot up, ayy
Aikogren dai den, shoot up, ayy
Luka damsok dai den, shoot up
Hey, akai funi dai den shudu
Hey, akai tani dai den shudu
Hey, aikogren dai den shudu
Hey, we headin' up
Nukunye zwango bagana mami
Iti zaken simte gelapazi
Agaponga fuga amabwani
Boy he headin' up she headin' up
O fuku nyeswa ngoba ka na msali
Girlfriend jula unga kali
Edi temba la kuku silasi
I know he's on your side, he headin' up
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
(She's on your side, she's on your side)
Oh, he don't know sideways
Papaya, queso, but don't give it up
Hey, boy, I know that I will lift you up one day
Tell the folks who march against you, have to go away
Tell them them can't get you down,'cause we let you stay
No smoke, no coke, it will merge you up
Hey, nothing I can tell will give you life every day
Tell the patriots, my cock a love none on the way
You rather leave him alone, go back
