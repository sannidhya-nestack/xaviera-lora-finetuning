What I need is you and me, oh, oh, in this place (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
In this place, in this place (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
What I need is you and me, oh, in this place (oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
In this place, in this place (in this place, in this place, in this place)
What I need is you
Plus three, I got the formula for ecstasy
Take me by my hand and I'll follow you to the moon
Temperature is rising, tell me what you'd like to do
Know the vision in your game, I'll never be the same
I think I need you every night
You're the solution to my hide
No wonder when the spark of my light
You know that you're the reason I'm feeling this high
And if I'm dreamin'
Don't wake me tonight
Just don't wake me tonight
Can I do it?
You feel amazing
Can I do it?
You feel amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing
You give me, you give me life
You make me, you make me feel so right
You make me, you make me see brighter sides
Your love is like the ocean deep and wide
You give me life and I'm feeling so alive
You got me moving slow
Just like a reggae flow
I found my home now I know
Your love brings me to my knees
My knees, my knees
You're bringing me to my knees
Cause you, you feel amazing
You feel amazing, you know I do
You feel amazing, you feel amazing
Amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing
