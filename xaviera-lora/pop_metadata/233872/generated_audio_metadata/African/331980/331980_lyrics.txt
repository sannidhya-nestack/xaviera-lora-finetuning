God look I need superflua
Umasuge tuzewa
Kinki utami zikizi oya
U polis umbo yawa
Shosot, ya zwe na kumbula
Mange kwa nange ya chabula
Enda bakta la ye gifuna
Enduwe na mkha nge ya chabula
Na, gota enzo yi krauna
Oh on this run you are the owner
Kingi me explosive lava
You are me number one shaba
Shosot, totu kalis umpe fundo wa
It's all I've been taught, it's all I've been taught
It's all I've been told to do
It's all I've been taught, it's all I've been taught
The truth is I miss you
And there's some joy on your side, there's some joy on your side
Say me me no post-apoo
And I'm the king who will travel this world alone again
It's all I've been trying, it's all I've been trying, it's all that I've been trying to do
It's all I've been trying, it's the one thing I've been trying to do
Bless them to your music, bless them to your lyrics, and then they know who's to do
My life is a kid, no child, but it's a boy I want
Just so I can tell you I'm the number one, number one, number one
Just so I can tell you I'm the number one, number one, number one
Just so I can tell you I'm the number, number one, number one
Just a girl who can't get to bed from the one
Ula suge tu zewa
Guki busa li si tizi oya
Udo li su oya wa
