As if it were like yesterday
As if it were like, as if it were
I still remember everything we've shared (I miss it, were like, I miss it)
No, no, explanation did turn the love between us
Even though I can't see you
You always shine through the eyes of my children
I feel so good
When you blow your angel wings over me
I feel so good
Yeah, I feel secure every time I hear your voice through the silent wind
Father, father, father
Oh father, father, father
I'm relying on your wisdom in life
Even death couldn't break our bond
No, exploration did turn the love between us
Even though I can't see you (see you)
I wish and through the eyes of my children (children)
(Daddy, yeah)
(See you, see you)
Now (now)
(See you again)
Experience and detune the love between us (between us)
(See you again, see you again)
Even though I can't see you (see you)
I wish and through the eyes of my children (children)
(Daddy, yeah)
See you later!
