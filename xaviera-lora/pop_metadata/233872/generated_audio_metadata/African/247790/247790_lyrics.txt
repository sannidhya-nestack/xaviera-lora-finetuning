Starlight gleaming, moonlight streaming
Desert sky, an evening sweet taboo
Ancient longings, no belongings
I'll return again to Timbuktu
I remember slow and tender
Sad mandingo queen of midnight blue
Stolen mornings, unheard warnings
I was born again in Timbuktu
Ah, the sweetness of my bitter tears
Wakes my heart in déjà vu
Softly in the night a voice I hear
Calling me to Timbuktu
Settled danger to a stranger
In a foreign land of brown and blue
Restless lover took another
Stored my heart away in Timbuktu
Ah, the sweetness of my bitter tears
Wakes my heart in déjà vu
Softly in the night her voice I hear
Calling me to Timbuktu
Starlight gleaming
Moonlight streaming, desert sky, an evening sweet time, oh
Ancient longings, no belongings, I'll return again to Timbuktu
(Alarm sounds)
