Waski, Ronda, Zina made a bang
Adikineos, Alup, mmm
I don't wanna run (I don't wanna run)
I don't wanna play (I don't wanna play)
I won't be alone (I won't be alone)
Till I make my dreams (Till I make my dreams)
I don't wanna run (I don't wanna run)
I don't wanna play (I don't wanna play)
I won't be alone
Till I make my dreams
Got the love for people
But they never get the same for me
Got the hopes in people
But they never saw that in me
Who the hell you think you are
What's your plan please let me out
I don't complain about my route
I feel I have to shout around and I bingo
Me I won't be included
No time for instructions
I move fast with my passion
I move harder, no light talking
Bad energy far from me
Leave me lonely I won't be
But my business out there
Yeah yeah I
I don't wanna run
I don't wanna play
I won't be alone
Till I make my wings
I don't wanna run
I don't wanna play
I won't be alone
Till I make my dreams
They talking much
They want chop your matter make everyone see it
Life no be fair
If a day fall be like say
I want job let me go leave me alone now
People sucka, people bad, people fake-a, people lie
People never gonna be there when you need them, no never
People sucka, people bad, people fake-A, people lie
People never gonna be there when you broke, oh yeah yeah yeah
I don't wanna roll, I don't wanna play
I won't be alone, till I make my wings
I don't wanna run (I don't wanna run) I don't wanna play (I don't wanna play)
I won't be alone'til I make my dreams
