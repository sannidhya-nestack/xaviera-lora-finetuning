Baktu baktu gami kulof
Sexy sexy got me show off
Mi vida mi vida loca
The feeling
Got me crazy got me dreaming
You got me real
The healing
Got me dancing got me singing
You set me free
Only your body
Can heal my body
Oh only your body

Cannot, cannot, cannot, cannot get enough of your sweet touch
Cannot, cannot

My heart, my heart, my heart, my heart beats fast when we are alone
At last
The feeling
Got me crazy, got me dreaming
You got me real
The healing
Got me dancing got me singing you set me free
Only your body
Can heal my body

Can heal my body
Oh only your body
