Look at me up on the trapeze
Swinging number here, can you see me
A famous acrobat on the trapeze
Look at me fly on the trapeze
Such talent and grace, can you see me?
This famous acrobat on the trapeze
I'm so brave and daring, hanging in the sky
Watch me catch the lady, as through the air she flies up in the sky
Look at me up on the trapeze
Standing up here can you see me?
They'll catch me when I swing with the greatest of ease
I'll swing back and forth'til my feet touch to the stars
I'll do three somersaults then he'll catch me in his arms
Just wait'til you see
Oh look at me swing on the trapeze
Suspended up here where you all can see
You'd think we all could fly up in the sky
One by one we'll swing up till our feet touch top the tent
Then one by one we'll let go and bounce upon a net
From the trapeze
From the trapeze
From the trapeze
