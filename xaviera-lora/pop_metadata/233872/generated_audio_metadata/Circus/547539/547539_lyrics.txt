My name is Annie, they call me Fanny, I travel on the road
Since the first grade, I've wanted to play a clown in a circus show
The music and the lights just thrill the girl inside
Clowns are people too, we have mommies and daddies like you
Though we joke and we play, leave you laughing all day
Clowns are people too
Ooh, hehehehe, I just cracked myself up, hehehe
They're gonna laugh their heads off, hehehe
My name is Bobo and did you all know that I'm just the same as you
Though my shoes are too big and my makeup and wig make me look like I came from the moon
Though I may be just a fool, at least I'm a fool for you
Clowns are people too, we're mommies and daddies like you
Though I jump and we play, I'll be laughing all day
Clowns are people too
Do you know that I hear being a clown today is very fashionable
Yes, of course, especially if you are a European clown
I just love the bourgeois
My name is Weezy and it ain't easy the crazy things we do
The running, the jumping, the falling, the thumping, they should lock us in a zoo
Though I may have half a wit, I know I'll never quit
Clowns are people too
We have mommies and daddies like you
Though we joke and we play, we be laughing all day
Clowns are people too
I think I'm having a bad hair day
Makeup!
Make it really messy!
My name is Cal, I'm king of the clowns, if you're smiling I know why
I'm cute and I'm fun and I honk when I run and I jump when my pants are on fire
If you're looking past my nose, you'll surely come to know
Clowns are people too, we are mummies and daddies like you
Though we joke and we play and we're laughing all day
Clowns are people too
I'm so marvelous, I can't stand it
They like me, they really like me
Vegas here I come
My name is Otis and what I like most is a boy or girl with cheer
When I stand on my head and I start to pretend to play it gets through my ears
If I can't make you laugh, don't give this clown the axe
Clowns are people too, we have mommies and daddies like you
Though we jump and we play, got you laughing all day
Would you please shut up?
Clowns are people too
Can we jump, can we play, are you laughing all day?
How's a people tube?
