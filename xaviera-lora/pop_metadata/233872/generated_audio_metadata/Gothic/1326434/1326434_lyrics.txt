Silence veils the waiting room
Incense curls in drifting plume
Midnight hush around us flows
Cards prepare their tales to show
Hold your breath, the moment bends
Past and future may commence
Terror whispers pull me near
Turn the cards and hush the fear
Fate is humming through each line
Terror whispers you are mine
Terror whispers dare to see
Every secret set it free
Spinning threads we now entwine
Terror whispers you are mine
Painted arcs in measured grace
Devil smiles behind his face
Lovers cast their silhouettes
On a vow that never sets
Hold your breath, the moment bends
Past and future may commence
Terrored whispers pull me near
Turn the cards and hush the fear
Fate is humming through each line
Terrored whispers, you are mine
Terrored whispers dare to see
Every secret set it free
Spinning threads we now entwine
Terrored whispers
You are mine
Wheel keeps turning, hearts align
Destiny on thinning line
Lay them down and read the sign
Tarot whispers
You are mine
Terrored whispers pull me near
Turn the cards and hush the fear
Fate is humming through each line
Terrored whispers, you are mine
Terrored whispers dare to see
Every secret set it free
Spinning threads we now entwine
Terrored whispers, you are mine
You are mine
