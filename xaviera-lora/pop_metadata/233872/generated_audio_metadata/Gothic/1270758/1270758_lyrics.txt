Shadows creep along a broken ground
Whispers fear and a duller sound
Flames will rise to light the way
Driving me where I hope to kiss
Abandoned hope, my veteran
Through the gates of all my sense
Lost forever, can't escape
Betting hope I set my fate
Shadows creep along the broken ground
Whispers fade without a sound
Frays arise to lighten the way
Drowning me where my hope decays
But betting hope I'll better live
Through the gates of all cells
A loss forever can't escape
Abandoned hope, place of my fate
Faces fade in the ashen glow
Echoes of a life I used to know
Chains bind time around my soul
In this darkness, I lose control
Abandoned hope, I've had to live
Through the gates of all my sins
A loss forever can't escape
Abandon hope, it's in my fate
Arms up, oh, no longer shy
Time stands still, no longer mine
In the depths, I hear a call
In this hell, I start to fall
Abandon hope, I'll have to live
Through the gates of all our sins
The lost forever can't escape
Abandoned hopeless in my fate
As the flames consume my sight
I surrender to eternal night
