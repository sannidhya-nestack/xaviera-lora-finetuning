Round around the world they go
They're looking for some boys and girls
They're gonna make it a house, yeah
Feed every creature
Doesn't matter if you can't sing
You're gonna be the latest thing now
Your dancing genes get copied by the nation's preachers
Don't worry you've got nothing to say
Another cover version it's on its way
You're in the morning papers (What can you do?)
You're on the radio (What can you do?)
You're on the television (What can you do?)
It's a mystery to me
Run around the field, auditions
Test the roads for recognition
You're getting nowhere, squad peeps getting ever closer
Nothing weak side, failed ambition
Get a grip to all your frustration
The London scene, a place where you can see and be seen
It's your ride with a rising star
It's the only way that you'll get far
You're in the morning papers (What can you do?)
You're on the radio (What can you do?)
You're on the television (What can you do?)
It's a mystery to me
There's a fly upon your wall
Watching you to show us all
Our life is real
What you think and how you feel
So you know it won't last long
Your fifteen minutes have come and gone
The emptiness
Sit back enjoy the loneliness
No one seems to care at all
You're not famous anymore
You're in the morning papers (What can you do?)
You're on the radio (What can you do?)
You're on the television (What can you do?)
It's a mystery to me
You're in the morning paper
What can you do?
You're on the radio
What can you do?
You're on the television
What can you do?
Makes a mystery to me
