Pagan dreams in a pagan world
All you want is a pagan girl
Help me, help me, I'm in hell
Phantom girls dancing in the sky
Demon sings me a lullaby
Help me, help me, I'm in hell
Take the world, take the women
Give me death, I'm more than willing
Our fates are worse than death
Take the world, take the women
Give me death, I'm more than willing
All fates are worth, than death
Pagan dreams in a pagan world
All you want is a pagan girl
Help me, help me, I'm in hell
Help me, help me, I'm in hell
