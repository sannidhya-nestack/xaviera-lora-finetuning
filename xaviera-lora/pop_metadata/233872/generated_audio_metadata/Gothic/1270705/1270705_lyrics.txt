Underneath the pale sunrise
We'll carry dreams with heavy sighs
Promises of golden crown
And now the walls are tumbling down
We're the lost generation, standing in the rain
Searching for a shelter from the storm and pain
Echoes of a future, fading in the air
Only on the hope that's barely there
Underneath the pale sunrise
We carry dreams with heavy sighs
Promises are fold and crown
And now the walls are tumbling down
We're the lost generation standing in the rain
Searching for a shelter from the storm and pain
Echoes of the future fading in the air
Holding on to hope that's barely there
Hats we tread are worn and cold
Chasing warmth but finding bold
We're the lost generation standing in the rain
Searching for a shelter from the storm and pain
Echoes of the future fading in the air
Holding on to hope that's barely there
Lost through the cracks a light appears
A gentle call beyond the fears
We'll build a world from broken clay
And find our dawn beyond the grey
We're the lost generation standing in the rain
Searching for a shelter from the storm, babe
Echoes of the future fading in the air
Holding on to hope that's buried there
