Hello
I just wanna say hello
We haven't spoken too long
You know you are my hero
That's why I'm writing this song
No more texting or facebooking
You are hot and I'm good looking
Let's go around the world
Let's go around the world
I don't mind if you are driving
And I like the way you're whining
We can go fast and slow
But I just call to say hello
I just wanna say hello
Make a conversation flow
And now
And now
I just want to say hello
We haven't spoken too long
You know you are my hero
That's why I'm writing this song
No more texting or facebooking
You are hot and I'm good looking
Let's go around the world
Let's go around the world
I don't mind if you are driving
And I like the way you whining
We can go fast or slow
But I just want to stay alone
I just don't wanna say hello (Hello)
Make a conversation flow (Hello)
I don't mind if you are driving
And I like the way you're whining
We can go fast or slow
But I just called to say hello
I just wanna say hello
Make a conversation through
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hello, hello, hello
Bye
