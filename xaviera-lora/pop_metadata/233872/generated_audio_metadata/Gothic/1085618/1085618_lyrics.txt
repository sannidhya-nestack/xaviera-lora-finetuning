Going nowhere but looking back
Drip your towels and your Union Jacks
From the terrace of the House of Lords
Shot off from the outside world
All the time you're destroying what you love
This is real life not some national park
Close our eyes to the 21st century
Heritage only in the street
Is this what you want?
Blue England
Is this what you want?
Faded Empire glory
Is this what you want?
Past without a future
Things can never stay the same
So you hate what you don't understand
So you stand for the common man
So you know your history
Only see what you want to see
All the time you're destroying what you love
This is real life not some national park
Close our eyes to the 21st century
Heretics are only industry
Is this what she wants?
A new England
Is this what she wants?
Faded apart glory
Is this what she wants?
Past without a future
Things can never stay the same
So you talk about sovereignty
Pride of England, the head of the Queen
Purity of your national tribe
Only aimed to repel the tide
All the time you're destroying what you love
This is real life, not some national park
Close our eyes to the 21st century
Heritage of the industry
Is this what you want, blue England?
Is this what you want, faded up high glory?
Is this what you want, a past without a future? (Oh-oh)
Things can never stay the same
Is this what you want, a little England? (Oh-oh)
Is this what you want, faded and part glory? (Oh-oh)
Is this what you want, a past without a future? (Oh-oh)
Is this really what you want?
