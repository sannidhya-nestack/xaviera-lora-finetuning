Remember, stay in aggression
Speed and aggression will win the fight
When the North is comfortable playing nice
G-g-g-guns, grenades with ammo
Felt are the weapons we'll use to light the fuse
So we'll strike a match and let it light
We'll burn while we're down to the ground
That fight that night
I'll never et
The words you said in my head
Look back to the start
The world better fall apart
Move and break your heart apart
With more contact we got the three light up machine
As I go things are bound to explode
So lock your metal on cause weapons are free
But you got an anchor tied to me
You're holding me down hoping I drown
But I will raise you from the ground
Not a pride that I'll never et the words you said in my head
Looked back to the start but we're fading apart
I know we're breaking apart
This battle has begun
We can no longer run
I've got to face it one by one
For the full of all this stuff
This battle has begun
We can no longer run
I've got to face it one by one
For the full of all this stuff
That's right now and I'll never et the words you said in my head
Look back to the start we were better apart
We'll only break apart
That's right now and I'll never et the words you said in my head
Look back to the start we were better apart
We'll only break apart
