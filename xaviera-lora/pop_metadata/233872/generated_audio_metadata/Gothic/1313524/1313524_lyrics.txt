Whispers circle through the air
Echoed secrets everywhere
Flickering voices lead me on
Twisting truth till hope is gone
In these walls I feel your name
Tangled threads of wordless blame
Quiet eyes that never cease
Riddles binding my release
Flipping through the silent cries
Bound together by hollow ties
Lights I can't break free
Torn between what used to be
Pull me closer, won't let go
Hollow ties, they're all I know
Lingering dreams stain my skin
Nighttime chanting draws me in
Faded echoes mark the day
Soft illusions slip away
Dark confessions tangled tight
Twisted longing in the night
Flickers of your distant gaze
Lead me through this endless maze
Hollow ties they circle round
In this silence I am bound
Hollow ties, I can't break free
Tongue between more than what used to be
Pull me closer, won't let go
Hollow ties, they're all I know
Hollow ties still burning me
Dreams undone, no remedy
Fading words still haunting me
Hollow ties eternally
I've got your midnight pulse
Pulling deeper out of sight
Losing feeling, lost the fight
Pulse unspoken, taking hold
Secrets whispered, dark and bold
Midnight pulse, I sink again
Wrapped in whispers without end
Silence binds me, pulls me near
Fading silence
