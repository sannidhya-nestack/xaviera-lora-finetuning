I stand before the shifting ground
Where everything is lost and found
The weight of time it pulls me through
What was broken now is new
I hear the call, I feel the strain
Of something greater in the pain
The hands of fate, they turn so slow
But the divine will always show
Through the fire, through the flood
We are made of tears and blood
The divine process, it never ends
Breaking us down to build again
Through the rise and fall we all must bend
The divine process will make us whole again
The spiral twist that pulls us in
The deeper truth beneath the skin
The trials come but never leave
Teaching us what to believe
There's no escape, no easy way
But through it all we must obey
The rules are carved in sacred stone
In the end we stand alone
Through the fire, through the flood
We are made of tears and blood
The divine process, it never ends
Breaking us down to build again
Through the rise and fall, we all must bend
The divine process will make us whole again
The fire through the flood, we are made of tears and blood
The divine process, it never ends
Breaking us down to build again
Through the rise and fall, we all must bend
The divine process will make us whole again
In every crack the light breaks through
It's in the pain we're born anew
The wrath and grace in every breath
The process leads us through to death
The divine process, it never ends
Breaking us down to build again
Through the rise and fall, we all must bend
The divine process will make us whole again
We're turning back, no end in sight
The divine process, our guiding light
We rise, we fall, we break, we mend
In the divine, we begin again
