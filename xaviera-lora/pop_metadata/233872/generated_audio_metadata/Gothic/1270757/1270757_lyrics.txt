Twilight breaks the cityscape tonight
Echoes of your voice slip out of sight
Footsteps trace the paths we used to know
Haunted by the places we can't go
In the mirror of the moonlit sky
I see reflections of you and I
Whisper whispers whisper your name
Nothing ever feels the same
Shadows stretch across the cobblestone
Secrets hide within the all unknown
Raindrops fall like tears upon the ground
Listen for a lost and distant sound
In the mirror of the moonlit sky
I see reflections of you and I
Whisper with whisper your name
Nothing ever feels the same
Shines a river we cannot rewind
Leaves are searching, yearning to find
Fragments of a dream we let slip by
Haunted by the places we can't go
In the mirror of a violet sky
I see refractions of you and I
Whisper with whisper your name
Nothing ever feels the same
