I don't know what to write to you
I don't want to never, never lie to you
But I will surely try
Oh, I'm not having fun
Something just came up
I'm going through some quantum singularities right now
And we're breaking up
When you find that you're a stranger to yourself and nomenclature
I will have to ask you to return
My tennis shoes and hooded sweatshirt'cause I'm freezing at my feet
Or probably should've read the manual
I had to win negotiations, deal with all the complications
But I was more concerned with better things
I found myself in this position, now I'm such a great musician
All I have to do is learn to sing
Whoa, whoa
Please describe the way I look from way down there
As I leave the atmosphere behind the scenes
Pinholes in the sky
Yeah, now I'm having fun, you can't hold me down
It's apparent that this parallel is paradoxically
Unsound, unsound
When you find that you're a stranger to yourself in nomenclature
I will have to ask you to return
My tennis shoes and hooded sweatshirt'cause I'm freezing at my feet
Or probably should've read the manual
I had to win negotiations, deal with all the complications
But I was more concerned with better things
I find myself in this position, now I'm such a great musician
All I have to do is sing this song
When you find that you're a stranger to yourself and nomenclature I will have to ask you to return
My tennis shoes and hooded sweatshirt cause I'm freezing at my feet I probably should've read the manual
I hide away in negotiations deal with all the complications but I was more concerned with better things
I find myself in this position now I'm such a great musician all I have to do is learn to sing
