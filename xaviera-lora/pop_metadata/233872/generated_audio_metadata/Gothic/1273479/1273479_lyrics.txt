I'm reaching for a quiet place where echoes never stray
The silence bends, it pulls me in and takes the weight away
The days collapse, they part away, but somehow I still breathe
It's solace in the emptiness that never asks to leave
And in the still, I find my voice
The world is hopes, I make my choice
Solace, it holds me
It knows me, in the quiet I'm free
Solace, it shows me
It grows me, in the space I can be
The days collapse, they blur to tea
I used to chase the noise around just to feel alive
But now the calm's my only friend that still wears my disguise
The world keeps spinning out of tune but I don't need the sound
In solace I'm no longer lost, I'm finally found
And in the still, I find my voice
The world dissolves, I make my choice
Solace, it holds me, it knows me
In the quiet, I'm free
Solace, it shows me, it grows me
In the space I can be
The days collapse, they blur to tea
The silence isn't empty, it's everything I need
A moment suspended, a place where I can bleed
Without the rush, without the strain
Solace in the absence keeps me sane
Solace, it holds me, it knows me
In the quiet I'm free
Solace, it shows me, it grows me
In the space I can be
The days collapse, they burn deep
It's solace, it's solace, the quiet never lies
Solace, solace, where my spirit flies
