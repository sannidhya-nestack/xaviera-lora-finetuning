To an unknown friend, a hidden code I send
A secret symbol I extend, the reason I cannot attend
But I will come again, when the autumn leaves descend
And the blackbird bends, where the labyrinth ends
With a serpent's grin, I know you'll let me in
Where no one's ever been, into your sweet secret sin
Through a whispered thread
In the dark unsaid, a flicker burns in red
Like a book no one has read
I trace the path unseen, to the cracks between
Where the echoes lean, and the silent steps between
Where the serpents grin, I know you'll let me in
Where no one's ever been, into your sweet secret sin
A silver key in hand
Drawn by fate's demand
In the hush of night
A hot story we write
No witness left, no trace
Just a fleeting embrace
In the shadows we spin
Bound by sweet secret sin
Sweet secret sin, where have you been?
Sweet secret night, our sweet delight
Sweet secret dreams forever and ever and ever
When the dawn peeks through
Like a ghost I'll slip from view
But the echoes stay within
Of our sweet secret sin
With the serpent's grin
I know you'll let me in
Into your secret sin
Where no one's ever been
When the dawn peeks through
Like a ghost I'll slip from view
But the echoes stay within
Of our sweet secret sin
A silver key in hand
Drawn by fate's demand
In the hush of night
A hot story rewrite
No witness left, no trace
Just a fleeting embrace
In the shadows we spin
Bound by sweet secret sin
With a serpent's grin
I know you'll let me in
Into your secret sin
Where no one's ever been
Where have you been, sweet secret night
You make it so right, sweet secret song
Can never be wrong
With a serpent's grin
I know you'll let me in
Into your secret sin
Where no one's ever been
Sweet secret sin
Where have you been?
Sweet secret night
You make it so right
Sweet secret song can never be wrong
