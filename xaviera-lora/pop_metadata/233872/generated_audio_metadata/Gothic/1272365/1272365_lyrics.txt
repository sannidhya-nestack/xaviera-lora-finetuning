We move between the classes where the silence breaks
Dust of what was lost is carried in our wake
We don't need the daylight under skies of stone
The ground beneath our feet, a place to call our own
Where the air is heavy but we don't feel the weight
In the stillness we are free to meet our fate
We dance in grey bars where the cold wind is hung
Spinning'round the tune until the morning comes
Laughter in the hollow as we find our way
Dancing in the graveyard'til the break of day
Where the air is heavy but we don't feel the weight
In the stillness we are free to meet our fate
We dance in grave lights where the cold winds hum
Spinning round the tomb'til the morning comes
Lost her in the hollow as we find our way
Dancing in the graveyard'til the break of day
Monuments of marble names we never knew
But here we find a rhythm, something raw, something true
There's no final ending, just a space to breathe
In the quiet resting place we never want to leave
Where the ground is cracking but we don't feel the fall
In the stillness we are standing after all
We dance in graveyards where cold winds hum
Spinning on the tunes'til the morning comes
Laughter in the hollow as we find our way
Dancing in the graveyards'til the break of day
The storms they speak in silence telling us to stay
A melody between the cracks that never fades away
We laugh at what we're leaving
We know where we belong
In this place of endings
We're singing our own song
We dance in graveyards where the cold winds hum
Spinning round the tomb'til the morning comes
Laughter in the hollow as we find our way
Dancing in the graveyard'til the break of day
We dance, we dance'til the morning light
In the graveyard's arms we hold the night
