There is a lonely girl
She lives in her own world
You know her name
Alice in Wonderland (Alice, Alice, Alice)
Alice in Wonderland
She laughs and then she cries
Confused and bored she tries
To spell her name
Alice in Wonderland (Alice, Alice, Alice)
Alice in Wonderland
It's all very curious
Drink me
Curiouser and curiouser
Eat meat
The riddles blow her mind
She used to be so kind
What was her name?
Alice in Wonderland (Alice, Alice, Alice)
Alice in Wonderland
So was it all a dream?
A very cunning scheme?
We'd overcame
Alice in Wonderland (Alice, Alice, Alice)
Alice in Wonderland
It's all very curious
Drink me
Curiouser and curiouser
Eat meat
I listen in on the line
Alice in Wonderland
Alice in Wonderland
Alice in Wonderland
