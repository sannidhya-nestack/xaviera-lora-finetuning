I've got ideas above my station
I've got ruts and masturbation
Got ambition and I need to learn
I'm just a lucky sperm
I got a degree in scientific math
And I got four stars up my Weight Watchers class
I got a fancy car and money to burn
But I'm just a lucky sperm
I'm just a lucky sperm, I'm alright
I'm just a lucky sperm, I feel fine
Happy cause I got born, I'm alright
I'm just a lucky sperm
I go horse riding at the mansion to Lent
I download porn from the internet
I want a high position in a corporate firm
But I'm just a lucky sperm
I'll never feel that life is grim
Or work all day for next to nothing
I'll never rock or stink or burn
Like me, I'm a lucky sperm
I'm just a lucky sperm, I'm alright
I'm just a lucky sperm, I feel fine
Not because I got born, I'm alright
I'm just a lucky sperm
I'm just a lucky sperm, I'm alright
I'm just a lucky sperm, I feel fine
Hot because I got a bone, I'm alright
I'm just a lucky sperm
I'm just a lucky sperm, I'm alright
I'm just a lucky sperm, I feel fine
Happy'cause I got born, I'm alright
I'm just a lucky, really really lucky
I'm just a lucky sperm
