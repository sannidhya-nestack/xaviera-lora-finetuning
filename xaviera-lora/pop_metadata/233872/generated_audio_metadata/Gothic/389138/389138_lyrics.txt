You came back with a plan and a suntan
You saw it through, you saw it through
You came back with a plan and a suntan
What did I do so wrong?
This is the last song
I'll write about you
I'll never call again
Have you otten the night we kissed?
You said you'd never
You said you'd never
Have you otten the night we kissed
What did I do so wrong
This is the last song
I'll write about you
I'll never call again
I don't have the strength to go on
You have your way
I don't have the strength to go on
You have your way
What did I do so wrong?
This is your last song
I'll write about you
I'll never call again
What did I do so wrong?
This is your last song
I'll write about you, I'll never call again
