Once upon a concept misunderstood
We saw a crew without equation
Legends lagging dots and lines
Lead us through a list defined
By the likes of things we thought that count
We add them up and we spit them out
There's no calculation to victory
No boundaries just aimless astrology
Abandoned, defile me
There's no consolation or sympathy or quitting excuses aside
Listen to me, listen to me
Post affiliation I concede
There was more than I have cared to see
All the soulless sellouts turn
A thoughtless phrase with dirty words
It's a drive to try it and we are not impressed
There's no calculation to victory
No boundaries, just aimless astrology
Abandoned, defile me
There's no consolation or sympathy
Quitting excuses aside
Listen to me, listen to me
There's no calculation to victory
No boundaries, just aimless astrology
Abandoned, defy me
There's no consolation or sympathy
Quitting excuses aside, listen to me
There's no calculation to victory
No boundaries, just aimless astrology
Bars that define me
There's no consolation or sympathy
Quitting excuses is sad
Listen to me, oh listen to me, Loray can't you see?
All of the dirt, all of the bow, all of the filth, all of the wild, all of the guile, all of the pride, all of the crime, all of the time, all of the spite, all of the plight, all of the crime, listen to me, Loray can't you see? Oh listen to me, Loray can't you see?
