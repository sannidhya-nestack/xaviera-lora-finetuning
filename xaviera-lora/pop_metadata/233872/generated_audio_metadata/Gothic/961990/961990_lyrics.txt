Classes unite to here and now
Father's there to show us how
Future generations here to stay
Never give in, we'll keep the faith
Through pain, through gain, know what we cannot treat
Unity and strength is what we believe
Fight tomorrow and we'll fight today
We'll stay strong, it's the skinhead way
Power tools won't be divided
They will never stop the fighting
We know we're not bulletproof
They can say they know the truth
Through pain through gain to what we can achieve
Unity and strength is what we believe
Fight tomorrow and we'll fight today
We'll stay strong it's a skinhead way
Let's unite to heal her now
Father's left to show us how
Reaching generations in this day
Never giving won't keep the faith
Through pain through gain and what we cannot treat
Unity and strength is what we believe
Fight tomorrow and we'll fight today
We'll stay strong it's the skinhead way
