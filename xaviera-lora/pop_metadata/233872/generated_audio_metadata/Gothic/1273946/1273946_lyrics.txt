Leaves are falling, colours fade away
Cold winds call me, stealing warmth today
I walk along down paths we used to roam
Memories linger as the chill brings me home
Seasons change but love remains
Through the sun and through the rains
Turning tides and skies above
Can't erase this endless love
Odessas covering the ground
Silence echoes not a single sound
I trace your name upon the windowpane
Memories linger as the chill brings me home
Seasons change but love remains
Through the sun and through the rains
Turning tides and skies above
Can't erase this endless law
So the sand's covering the ground
Silence echoes, not a single sound
I trace your name upon the windowpane
Waiting for the sun to break these chains
When the blossoms bloom anew
Will the warmth lead me to you
Seasons change but love remains
Through the sun and through the rains
Turning tides and skies above
Can't erase this endless love
