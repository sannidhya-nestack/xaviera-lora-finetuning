Safety opening lightnings
Torches chasing shadows
Even in warmest winter grief
Odent silence will be changed
Ringing out in the name
Naked divine of silence
She will be blinded by another you
She will be, she will be, she will be
Two, two, two
Naked divided silence
Naked divided silence
She will be blinded by another you
She will be
Be, she will be
Be, she will be
Be
