I met her in a crowded bar in August
The jukebox played her favourite song
She'd never heard of Dylan
And the words she sung were wrong
But still she sang along
Still she sang along
I can still recall the boots on her feet
In the aftershave she wore
She never heard of Dylan
And the words she sung were wrong
But still she sang along
Still she sang along
She'd like to know who works to all the songs she's heard on radio
The TV, laptop, computer screens, the DJ plays the songs she's heard a million times before
To all those beats she moves so sure
How's her feature sound so pure?
How's her feature sound so pure?
On all those words she gets along
But still she sings along
I saw her just the other week
To her these days have not been kind
Still she puts on all her make-up
Ties her hair just right
I leave her now as I found her
Dancing off into the night
She'd never heard of Dylan
And the words she sung were wrong
But still she sang along
Still she sang along
She'd like to know the words to all the songs she's heard on radio
And TV, laptop, computer screens
The DJ plays the songs she's heard a million times before
To all those beats she moved so sure
Pounds their feet to sound so pure
Pounds their feet to sound so pure
And all those words she gets along
But still she sings along
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
