No more days or nights
Frozen time is passing by
Flashback of my mind
My heart and soul are cold inside
Playing in a garden of flesh and sins
To satisfy my holy dreams
Hanging upside down
To see the world around around
I'm tuned in at the frequency of love, of love
Riding a wave in your direction, a sonic boom, a cosmic explosion
I wish I could have a grace to make you happy, to make you smile
But this darkness has been covering my heart, has been torn apart, has been torn
I'm tuned in at the frequency of love, of love
Riding the wave in your direction, a sonic boom, a cosmic explosion
To your magic camera
Geometric error

Geometric error
Geometric error
Geometric error
Geometric error
I'm tuned in at the frequency of love, of love
Riding a wave in your direction, a sonic boom, a cosmic explosion
