Longboats crest, the oceans foam
This twilight fight, away from home
The seeress whispers, future seen
In the ruins, a might between
By the firelight, legends grow
Of thorns, hammer and tales of woe
And tales of woe
Starry downward, midnight's sun is fading
Runes for bathing, shields for tell the coming
Clang in the twilight, a warrior's heart within
Carve the runes as august gold
What's the cost?
Their skin cloaks enfold us cold
Beneath the starry sky so old
Steel and courage meet the test
The Valkyries call to the honored guest
Sing the songs of fallen braves
Hear the howl of winds across the graves
Through the mist the ravens soar
Over lands where legends are born
Rolling thunder, skies on fire
Carry souls to Odin's hire
Stories told in mead halls glow
Of frost giants, fierce and bold
In the heart of the icebound north
Where the Aurora dances forth
The white wolf howls, the night grows deep
Ancient keepers of secrets they keep
For a warrior's journey is never done
Under the pale light of the midnight sun
Hoist the sails, the adventure calls
The north wind wails against dirty walls
A saga's echo through the trees
Ripped in blood and carried seas
Glory found in battles roar
Odin's eye on distant shores
