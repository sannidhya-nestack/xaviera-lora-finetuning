Sit down, stand up, do as I say
Yes, miss, no, sir, day after day
Sit down, stand up, do as I say
Yes, miss, no, sir, day after day
Remembering school days
Violence in playgrounds
Rules to be obeyed
Singing the Lord's Prayer
Our Father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
For thine is the kingdom
The power and the glory
Sit down, stand up, do as I say
Yes, miss, no, sir, day after day
Sit down, stand up, do as I say
Yes, miss, no, sir, day after day
The classrooms were so cold
The lessons were dull
I learnt how to daydream
Please can I leave soon?
Two plus two is four
Four plus four is eight
Eight plus eight is sixteen
Sit down, stand up, do as I say
Yes, miss, no, sir, day after day
Sit down, stand up, do as I say
Yes, miss, no, sir, day after day
Day after day, day after day, day after day
Day after day, day after day, day after day
Day after day, day after day, day after day
