I remember the days of the three of summer
Time after dark playing guitar
Don't want you to leave'cause you're alright
I won't see you again at the midnight
It takes a light to the street from the bedroom
Condensed in a V .I. map
The perfumed black smoke filling the room
Leave the windows, house closed up in a place with a bright door
Walls come crashing to the ground and the after must be out of your mind
But I miss you and one big wall in the air that surround you now
What we had in mind but you ot
As you're going down there's gonna be a bang
And you're going down there's gonna be a bang
And you're going down there's gonna be a bang
And you're going down there's gonna be a bang
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo
And you're going down, there's gonna be a bang
And you're going down, there's gonna be bang
And you're going down, there's gonna be bang
And you're going down, there's gonna be bang
And you're going down, there's gonna be a bang
And you're going down, there's gonna be a bang
And you're going down, there's gonna be a bang
And you're going down, there's gonna be a bang
You're going down, there's gonna be a bang
And you're going down, there's gonna be a bang
There's gonna be a bang
There's gonna be a bang
you go in town, there's gonna be a bang
And you go in town, there's gonna be a bang
