And I know I feel fine
No dreaming I feel fine
Superimposing delusions on failing you
More than one thing at a time will only tie up all the tendrils of my mind
I crack
I slack
I crack
Real eyes know things
Real eyes know things
Real eyes know things
Real eyes know things
Real eyes know things
Real eyes know things
Heaven's just a state of mind
Hell is just a state of mind
Recover, be here now
Fixating
Be here now
Bracing for fate that erases my life with you
I know that when we're dead right here right now is all there ever will have been
Heart
Realize no things, realize no things, realize nothings, realize nothings, realize nothings
Thoughts of life on death are tangled bonds that send in the wind
Heaven's just a state of mind
Hell is just a state of mind
Heaven's just a state of mind (I can't find the heavens in my head)
Hell, it's just a state of mind (hell)
I can't find the heavens in my heart (hell)
Heaven's just a state of mind (hell)
I can't find the heavens in my heart (hell)
Still it's just a state of mind (I can't find the heavens in my head)
Thoughts of how (I can't find the heavens in my head, heart tangled by)
Just a state of mind (I can't find the heavens in my head)
