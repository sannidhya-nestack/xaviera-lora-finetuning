I say to you, everything is okay
I say to you, throw the fear away
I say to you, hurry up
I say to you, come and fill my cup
It's a new day, just do what you say and throw me away
It's a new day, just do what you say and throw me away
I say to you, everything is okay
I say to you
Throw the fear away
I say to you hurry up
I say to you come and fill my cup
It's a new day to do what you say and throw me away
It's a new day to do what you say and throw me away
I want to be like you, don't wanna be like me
I want to be like you, don't wanna be like me
It's a new day to do what you say and throw me away
It's a new day to do what you say and throw me away
It's a new day to do what you say and throw me away
I want to be like you, don't wanna be like me
I want to be like you, don't wanna to be like me
I want to be like you, don't wanna to be like me
I want to be like you, don't wanna to be like me
Like me, like me
Like me, like me, like me, like me
