I chose the wrong words, now I'm left to lose
Burdened by the enemy of love
Who's gone and taken all that's left
Just need a minute of your time
I can't take back the words
But if you give, I'll try to change your mind
It's been wicked dull days
Forbidden loneliness
The needle pops along the cracks and grooves
Of a broken hearted forty-five
Critical and left for dead
Another memory that's lost
Another letter
Ripped to shreds
Wash me in the water
Cover me in sand
Burn all of the bridges that lead to me
Till the love is washed off in the water
Covered in the sand
Build the highest wall of flames around me
Is what I have
No more emotion, farewell to pain
So long to innocence, no regret remains
Goodbye to misery, desensitised
Erase all energy, paralysed
Wash me in the water
Cover me in sand
Burn all of the bridges that lead to me
Till the love is washed off in the water
Covered in the sand
Build the highest wall of flames around me
Till the heart of black is what I have
