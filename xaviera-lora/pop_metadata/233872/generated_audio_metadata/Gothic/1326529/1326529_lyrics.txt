The clock is ticking loud tonight
A shadow falls, no end in sight
The sky is burning crimson red
We face the end with fear and dread
Ten, nine, eight, the world will fall
Seven, six, no time to stall
Five, four, three, the earth will shake
Two, one, zero, we won't away
The winds they howl like haunted cries
A storm of fire fills the skies
The ground is cracking under feet
No safe escape, no chance to cheat
Ten, nine, eight, the world will fall
Seven, six, no time to stall
Five, four, three, the earth will shake
Two, one, zero, we won't awake
Do we run or do we stay?
The end is here, no words to pray
Hearts are racing, screams unfold
We watch it all turn grey and cold
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The stars, they fade, they disappear
The final moment drawing near
We hold our breath, we hold on tight
The last goodbye to endless night
