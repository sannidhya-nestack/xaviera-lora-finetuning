Come on, your soul is weak, your flesh is mine
Come on, feel the power of weakness of decline
Feel yourself
The soul is weak
Your flesh is mine
Come on
Feel the sky
Come on
Your flesh is weak so is mine
The power of feeling inside
Come on, come on, feel your soul
Flesh is weak so am I
Feel your soul
Come on, feel that soul
Come on, feel the flesh, the soul is weak
Now you're beat
Come on, come on, come on
Your soul is mine
Your flesh is weak
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Come on, come on
Your soul is weak now your flesh is mine
Come on, your flesh is mine
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
The soul is mine
