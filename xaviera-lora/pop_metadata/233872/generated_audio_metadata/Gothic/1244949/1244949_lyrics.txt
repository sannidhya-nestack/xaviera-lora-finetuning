Brothers saw, crossing the sky
Circling close and dropping by
The seeded cause, exactly I knew
But never too close for system
As the day grows long
And dusk has spread
Then brother sun lays down his head
That moment in time when daylight fades
Comes sister moon in silver cascades
A radiant beauty it yes rises
She's very early but always surprises
White as the snow
And shines like a star
She's never too close
But always too far
Brother sun, sister moon
Like spring is to autumn
And December to June
Brother sun, sister moon
I'll sing if you want me to sing you a tune
In day upon night and night upon day
Always apart and apart they must stay
In orbit they float around each other
The nocturnal moon and her daybound love
Perpetually dancing and always in time
It's very much like celestial rhyme
Where touching's forbidden and distance must keep
It's a love that is here but never sweet
In the heavens they wander
But never drawn near
Their love is a song
Only they can still hear
Orbiting endlessly
In the cosmic speed
It's a love that's unbreakable
Yet one they can't keep
Brother sun, sister moon
Life's breeze to autumn
And December to June
Brother Sun, Sister Moon, I'll sing if you want me to sing you a tune
Brother Sun, Sister Moon, Spring is to Autumn and December to June
Brother, son, sister, moon, I'll sing if you want me to sing
