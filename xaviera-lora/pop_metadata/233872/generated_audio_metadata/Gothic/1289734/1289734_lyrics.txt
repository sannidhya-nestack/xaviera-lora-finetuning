I cannot help the suicidal
I cannot help myself
Your situation pleases me and
I know it all too well
I know it really hurts, my friend, I
I know you're all through with us
I cannot help this suicide
I can't help myself
Your situation pleases me
And we're not too bad
I'll be back to burn my bones
I can't listen anymore
The pain that has been taking us
It's been really small
I cannot help the suicide and
I cannot help myself
I cannot help before the dawn
I cannot help myself
And I heard it all before I found you
And it all went my way just the way it did with you
And I think that it is the soul
