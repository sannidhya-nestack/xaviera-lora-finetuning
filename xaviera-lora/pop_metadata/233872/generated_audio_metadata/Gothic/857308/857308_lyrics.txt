Did you see the news the other day?
This world is in great decay
Rivers flooding, fire and wind
People starving, we're close to the end
Lankerman, Lankerman
Lankerman, Lankerman
Gunfire at schools today
The Ten Commandments have been thrown away
This war is not against flesh and blood
But against principalities in high places
Open up and let his light shine in
Don't you know that he's full of love?
Open up and let his light shine in
Don't you know that he's shed his blood?
Open up and let his light shine in
Don't you know that he's full of love?
Lankerman, Lankerman
