Peter Ryan, sorry, I'm out of it
Here I am, sorry, I'm about to eat
(Muhahahahaha)
(Ooooooh)
Here I and sorrows sit, here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it
Sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows, sorrows.
Here I am
Sorrows
Sorrows about to hit
Here I am
Sorrows
Sorrows about to hit
Here I am, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
Here I am
Alright, I'm about to end
Come bow to it
Here I am sorrow sit
Here is my throne
Come bow to it
