ive them not for they know now
Of what they do
They know, they know, they know, they know
They know but they follow through
And tyrannize what should go now
They'll follow you
And so, and so, and so, and so
And so, it's all a ruse
If I said if you're no good you gotta go to a place that's real hot
Would you think I was right?
And if I said it was for your own good
You'd got to worship me now
Would you think I was right?
If I said if you're the good you gotta go to a place that's real hot
Would you think I was right?
And if I said it was for your own good
You'd got to worship me now
Would you think I was right?
ive them not for they know now
What they do
ive them not for they know now
What they do
ive them not for they know now
Of what they do
They know, they know, they know, they know
They know but they follow you
And time to not force them go now
They'll follow you
And so, and so, and so, and so
And so, it's all a ruse
If I said if you're the good you gotta go to replace this real heart
Would you think I was right?
And if I said it was for your own good you got to worship me now
Would you think I was right?
If I said if you're a goody guy go to a place that's real hot
Would you think I was right?
And if I said it was for your own good you got to worship me now
Would you think I was right?
If I said if you're a goody guy go to a place that's real hot
Would you think I was right?
And if I said I was for your own good
You'd got to worship me now
Would you think I was right?
And if I said I got a cutty guy
Go to a place that's real hot
Would you think I was right?
And if I said I was for your own good
You'd got to worship me now
Would you think I was right?
