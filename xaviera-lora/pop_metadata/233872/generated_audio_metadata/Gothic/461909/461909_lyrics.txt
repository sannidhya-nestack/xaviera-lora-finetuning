Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Hidden Sanctuary New Music Army, it is my proud privilege to welcome you all to tonight's main event.
In this corner from Tampa, Florida, the Demons of the Reconstruction held official welcoming committee, the Blessed Virgin Larry.
And in this corner, from Dayton, Ohio, the Prince of Darkwave
The best kept secret in the black dressed world, New Republic
Let's get ready to rumble
You've never told me of your anger with the world
You never told me why you dress up like a little fucking girl
We carry on with the struggle of man
No one gives a shit and no one gives a damn about the things that we believe
Or the things that we trust
Cause when we fucking down we all turn to nuts
They've always told you what to say
They're always tellin' me I'm just gettin' down with these crazy fucks
They say, "Listen, listen, hey, hey, listen"
I'm a real motherfucker, don't make me come and get ya
"Listen, hey, hey, listen"
I'm a little fatty motherfucker and I never love a nigga
"Listen, hey"
Hate, love, I'm a mean motherfucker
Don't make that no addition
Listen, hate, hate, love
I'm a little crazy motherfucker
But I ain't just a son of a bitch
Have you ever had one of those days that no matter where you look everything you see is completely fucked up
People living and crying and lying and dying
The hopes and dreams of all mankind still in the end were just destined to die
Shit, I think we're all just trying to survive
Day to day, doing the best we can with what we've got
Do you know that more people have been killed in the name of Christianity
Than have died from all the plagues, natural disasters, world wars and diseases like cancer and AIDS?
Now that's fucked
They've always told you what to say
They're always telling me I'm gonna get down on me and pray just like a sinner did
Living in hate, hate, hate, yeah
I'm a believer, motherfucker
Don't think I'm gonna come looking at ya
Living in hate, hate, hate, yeah
I'm a pistol back in my mind and I never will ive ya
Living in hate
Hate the letter
I'm a mean motherfucker
Don't make that sort of gesture
Leave the hate
Hate the letter
I don't disrespect your mama
But I'm really just a son of a bitch
People always askin' me, "Hey man, do you believe? Do you believe? What do you believe in?" Well, I'll tell you what I don't believe in
That's anybody tryin' to tell me when, where, how I can live my life
What I can say or what I can think, fuck that
It doesn't matter who you are
What you believe in or stand for
Cause in life there's only one thing that you can count on
And that's yourself
If you believe in yourself then you'll be strong
If you're strong then you'll survive
And hey, that's all we're trying to do anyway
I've always told you what to say
They're always tellin' me I'm lookin' down on me and prayin' just like a sinner should
Listen, hey, hey, yeah
I'm a beatin' motherfucker, don't make me come look at ya
Listen, hey, hey, yeah
I'm a beatin' blackie, mama said I never was lookin' at ya
Listen, hey
I'm a mean motherfucker, don't let that go at me, huh?
You hate, hate love, I hope this don't drag you out
But I'm really just a son of a bitch
Yeah, I'm a son of a bitch
Yeah, I'm a son of a bitch
Yeah, I'm a son of a bitch
Yeah, I'm a sorrowful bitch, sorrowful bitch
