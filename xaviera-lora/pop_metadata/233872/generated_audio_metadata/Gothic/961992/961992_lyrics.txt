Fuzzy head, after rebellion happens every year
Too much intoxication, blame it on the beer
I'm so fucked, I can't handle it, think I'm dying right here
Too much intoxication, blame it on the beer
Blame it on the beer, blame it on the beer
Blame it on the beer, blame it on the beer
I set the bank to see what's left
The cash won't laugh to me
All I had in there was a lousy 50p
I'm so fucked, I can't no longer live
Think I'm down to live
Too much intoxication, blame it on the beer
Blame it on the beer
Blame it on the beer
Blame it on the beer
Blame it on the beer
Fuzzy head, after a rebellion happens every year
Too much intoxication, blame it on the beer
I'm so fucked, I cannot handle it, think I'm dying right here
Too much intoxication, blame it on the beer
Blame it on the beer, blame it on the beer
Blame it on the beer, blame it on the beer
