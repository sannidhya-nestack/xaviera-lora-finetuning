Sparks from your fingers and fire in your eyes
You are horizon, you are my skies
Down by the market and out to the bay
Tall dusty buildings stand silent today
Clear cooling water and sand at my feet
Small voices singing their song of defeat
And even if it's just a dream
Doesn't make a difference to me
And even if it's just a dream
Doesn't make a difference to me
To me
Sparks from your fingers and fire in your eyes
You are horizon, you are my skies
Down from the heights to the city below
Concrete and steel, the sparkle and glow
We've travelled a long way to find ourselves here
We'll gather our strength'til the path reappears
And even if it's just a dream
That doesn't make a difference to me
And even if it's just a dream
That doesn't make a difference to me
To me
