Lost my voice inside your frequency
Secrets tangled deep in me
Breathing silence fading tone
Drifting to the unknown, unknown zone
Silver echoes rooms unknown
Quiet
Waves of sorrow, whispers break
I'm the dream you didn't take
Your words dissolve into my veins
Now numb this soul
I'm lost inside your digital lies
A thousand truths behind your lies
Burning wires, empty sighs
Fading slowly, digital lies
(dog barking)
Silence slipping through my skin
Endless cycles pulling thin
Echo chambers, loops replay
Caught forever yesterday
Singing softly, pixel dreams
Dark illusions play
Feel you breathing out of sight
Circuits tangled, fading light
Digital eyes consuming me
Locked inside your mystery
I'm lost inside your digital eyes
A thousand truths behind your lies
Burning wires, empty sighs
Fading in your digital eyes
Digitalize, erase my name
Leave me here, I'll take the blame
Disconnected, truth untied
Fade to ashes, say goodbye
