When mistakes are made, when the line is drawn
The division is said, yet obscure to all
Yet the truth remains, when the damage is done
Will you choose to stay or be forced to run?
Or be forced to run
I have otten all I've ever known
My whole existence is flawed and it shows
Put the things away, there's no blood today
My whole existence is blood and they know
When diplomacy break
Though you start to fall
They increase the take
Believe nothing at all
Yet the truth remain
When the damage is done
Will you choose to stay
Or be forced to run
Or be forced to run
I have otten all I've ever known
My whole existence is flawed and it shows
Put the things away that's been put today
My whole existence is flawed and they know
