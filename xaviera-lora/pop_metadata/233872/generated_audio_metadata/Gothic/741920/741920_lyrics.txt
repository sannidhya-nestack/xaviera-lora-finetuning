How bad do you all want love back
Lost girls there do manifest
By the look of the crowd up ahead
They are beautiful but still a wreck
How long can they keep such a painfully blissfully scene
Cause they won't stay dead
They won't stay dead
They won't stay dead
They won't stay dead
How long have you all been on fire?
Does it keep you from the thieves and lies
In the audience there is a dream
That is burdened by all that's obscene
How long can the world just ignore all the hate we've suppressed
we won't stay dead
We won't stay dead
We won't stay dead
We won't stay dead
We won't stay dead
There's a riot of passion and crime
And the grave robbed the father of time
In the audience there is a dream
That is burdened by all that's obscene
How long can the world just ignore all the hate we've suppressed
we won't stay dead
We won't stay dead
We won't stay dead
We won't stay dead
We won't stay dead
