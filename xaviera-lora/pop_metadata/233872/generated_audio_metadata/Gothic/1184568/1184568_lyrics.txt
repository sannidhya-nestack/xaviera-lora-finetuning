I used to read the paper
I used to watch the news
I used to let the worst day of this world on my show
The bodies of my breakfast, brutality with toast
Full dimension, ineffectually saving our lives
The machine cracks out, it take us like a film, like a game
All is peace, love and peace
War is peace, hate is peace
And although I stopped partaking
I must have gotten out too late for I regret
I still don't feel healthy, still immersed
Individually, say the colors we mash in great sound
Digicons, laptop, fail, laptop
He did not look to fail, look to die
(Yeah)
All is peace
Love and peace
War is peace, hate is peace
