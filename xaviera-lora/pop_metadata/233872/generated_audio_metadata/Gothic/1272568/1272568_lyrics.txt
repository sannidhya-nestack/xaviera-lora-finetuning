In quiet rooms, their wrinkles fade
A porcelain face and timeless lay
She wore a smile that couldn't last
Now frozen in the moment's past
Time stands still upon her skin
Secrets held deep within
No death mask of her grace
Capturing a timeless face
In the silence we all see
The beauty of her mystery
She danced through life with untold grace
A fleeting glimpse we can't replace
Now cast in stone, her final gaze
A memory that haunts our days
Echoes linger where she stood
A silhouette misunderstood
No death mask of her grave
Capturing a timeless face
In the silence we all see
The beauty of her mystery
Can we unveil what's concealed
Beneath the surface unrevealed
Her story waits to be unsealed
A silent truth to be revealed
A death mask of her grace
Capturing a timeless face
In the silence we all see
The beauty of her mystery
In silent halls her image stays
A lasting echo of her days
The death mask holds her final breath
A gentle touch beyond her death
