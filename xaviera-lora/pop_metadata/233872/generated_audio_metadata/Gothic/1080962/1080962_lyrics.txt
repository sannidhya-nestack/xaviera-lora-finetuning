Hey now, it's alright, don't you know that we're drinking tonight?
Hey now, it's alright, don't you know that you don't have to fight?
Hey now, it's alright, don't you now that we're drinking tonight?
Hey now, it's alright, don't you now that you don't have to fight?
I've seen you here but I never caught your name
Nothing to fear, don't you know we're all at home
You see the sneer so I don't know why you came
You're drinking beer but you know that's not to blame
Hey now it's alright don't you know that we're drinking tonight
Hey now it's alright don't you know that you don't have to fight
You've got a family waiting home for you
A lovely wife and them kids wanna wear your shoes
But when they start to wonder where you are
You might sober up and wonder how far it's far
And they will go away
And they will leave you on your own
But they want you to stay
See you for one more day
Don't let them leave you on your own
You've got your eye on the takeaway menu
You tell a lie just to broker something new
But if I'm right I think I know what you'll do
You bunch it up and you vomit on your boots
You've got a job but the bus is sinking twice
You've been told before but you're not very good with advice
Always a headache as he shows you to the door
It's not a good look when your face is on that block
And they will go away
And they will leave you on your own
But they want you to stay
See you for one more day
And they will go away
And they will leave you on your own
But they want you to stay
See you for one more day
Don't let them leave you on your own
Hey now, it's alright
Don't you know that we're drinking tonight
Hey now, it's alright
Don't you know that you don't have to fight
Hey now, it's alright
Don't you know that we're drinking tonight
Hey now, it's alright
Don't you know that you don't have to fight
Hey now, it's alright, don't you know that we're drinking tonight?
Hey now, it's alright, don't you know that you don't have to fight?
Hey now, it's alright, don't you that we're drinking tonight?
Hey now, it's alright, don't you don't have to fight?
Hey now, it's alright, don't you that we're drinking tonight?
Hey now, it's alright, don't you know that you don't have to fight?
