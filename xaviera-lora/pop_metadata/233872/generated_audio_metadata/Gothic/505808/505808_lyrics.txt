It's broken from the inside
Cleaning out your eyes
Lies in all direction
Stroked away and stole your sense of pride
No one's listening
Can you hear me? One breath from the whisper
One spark from the fire
Trapped here in dignity
Oh, it's all in your eyes
To rid this curse
Oh, it's all in your eyes
Of these slow fear
Oh, it's all in your eyes
And blinded hope
Oh, it's all in your eyes
The midnight skies
Oh, it's all in your eyes
To cleanse these thoughts
So wet these tears, and see things clear, forever
I'm shattered from the punchline
Absorbing all the light
Forcing your confession
Can you see me
One foot on the ceiling
Insides out and bleeding
Pour salt in your eyes, to rid this curse
Pour salt in your eyes, a feast to our fear
Pour salt in your eyes, and blinded hope
Pour salt in your eyes, the midnight skies
Pour salt in your eyes, to cleanse these thoughts
Pour salt in your eyes, to wipe these tears
Pour salt in your eyes, and see things clear
Pour salt in your eyes, forever
You stand there slowly draining me
Your words have turned your back on me
You stand there slowly draining me
Your words have turned your back on me
Open your eyes, this is for betraying me
Your voice has turned your back
(Open your eyes)
Stepping slowly, draining me (I'm cut down to silence)
Your words have turned your back on me (Open your eyes)
Stepping slowly, draining me (I'm cut down to silence)
Your words have turned your back on me
