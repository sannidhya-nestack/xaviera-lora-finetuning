The air grows cold while our worth gets lost in the crowd
The riches unfold while our worth gets lost in the crowd
They think that you're a fool
Blurred out faces, a crowd waits on you
The world keeps turning, bodies get lost in the crowd
Ideas mean nothing when lives are lost in the crowd
And they're waiting for you
Blurred out faces, the crowd always knows the truth
The game is played while the lines are drawn in the crowd
The end stays the same as we're all divided in the crowd
They know what you'll do
Blurred out faces, the crowd knows no rules
Perfection absorbs as mistakes get lost in the crowd
Chaos unfolds while our minds are shrouded in doubt
And they're waiting for you
Blurred out faces, the crowd always knows the truth
