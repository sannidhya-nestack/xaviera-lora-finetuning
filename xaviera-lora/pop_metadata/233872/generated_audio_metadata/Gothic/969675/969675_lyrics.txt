Spiral fog and smoke descends
Hostile forces start to blend
All the horses in the field
Frothing out their mouth, my dear
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear
You shot me into little pieces
Shot me into little pieces
Shot me into little pieces
Chop me into little pieces (pieces, pieces)
Bloody butcher in the yard
Staring at my face too hard
Got his eye on my behind
Everything and more beside (beside, beside, beside)
You chop me into little pieces
Chop me into little pieces
Chop me into little pieces
Chop me into little pieces (pieces, pieces, pieces, pieces, pieces)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Clean the cleaver with your mouth
Grunt and spit all the blood out
There's no need to feel a fear
Frothing at the mouth right here (here)
You chop me into little pieces
Chop me into little pieces
Chop me into little pieces
Chop me into little pieces (pieces, pieces, pieces)
This disease is mainly yours
Take my life without much loss
My skeleton is now your prize
Reducing me to half my size (size, size, size, size)
You chop me into little pieces
Chop me into little pieces
Chop me into little pieces
Chop me into little pieces (pieces, pieces, pieces, pieces, pieces, pieces, pieces)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Home
Spiral forest, moody sands, hostile forces start to blend
All the horses in the field, trotting out their mouths, my dear
You chop me into little pieces
Chop me into little pieces
Chop me into little pieces
Chop me into little pieces
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This disease is mainly yours
Take my life without much force
My skeleton is now your prize
Reducing me to half my size
Size, Size, Size, Size, Size, Size, Size, Size, Size, Size, Size, Size, Size, Size, Size, Size, Size, Size, Size
Side, side, side, side, side, side, side
