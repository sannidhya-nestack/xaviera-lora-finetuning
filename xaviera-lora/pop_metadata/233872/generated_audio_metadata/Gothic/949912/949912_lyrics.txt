Why you feel I don't know
I've learned nothing from the show
In a sea where you will drown
See my curtains falling down
What you die for
What you die for
How you see I don't know
Never ending opera show
I gotta go away
They ran away, way, way, way from home
You never, never know
They ran away, way, way, way from home
What will be, I don't know
I see nothing but the ghost
No more writing on my page
In the dark beyond the stage
What you lie for
What you lie for
How you see, I don't know
Never ending opera show
I got a girl away
They ran away, away, away from home
You never, never, never would
They ran away, away, away from home
Holy smokes
Broken mirrors
Holy ghosts
Broken mirrors
Holy smokes
Broken mirrors
Holy ghosts
Smoke and mirrors
