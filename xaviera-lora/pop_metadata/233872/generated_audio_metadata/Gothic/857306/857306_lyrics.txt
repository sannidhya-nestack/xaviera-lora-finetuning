There's a choice to be made
If you want to break those chains
Self-inflicted nonsense makes you insane
I know your heart's mine
I can see inside
I know all your desires
I can see inside
I know your heart's mine, I can see inside
I know all your desires, I can see inside
Struggle to get free
In me you are free indeed
I can remove those chains
That bind you every day
I know your heart's mine
I can see inside
I know all your desires
I can see inside
There's a war inside your head
There's a war inside your head
There's a war inside your head
There's a war inside your head
I'm trying to calculate everything
Well it's time for me to make the bell ring
Could you invite everybody
To attend the greatest party
Got something real, I got something live
For you to recognize
Ignite, royal dynamite, walk by faith, not by sight
All you have to say, all you need to pray
All you have to say, all you need to pray
I know your heart's in mine, I can see inside
I know all your desires, I can see inside
There's a choice to be made, if you want to break those chains
Self-inflicted nonsense makes you insane
Yeah
