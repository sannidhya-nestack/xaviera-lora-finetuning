In a shade of trees near whispers dwell A tale unfolds, a dark carousel
Beneath the moon's melancholy light A new vampire awakes tonight
Her eyes like flames in the somber glow Seeking secrets that only shadows know in her heart
A cold eternal fire
A hunger, a relentless never dies
She dances in darkness, a spectral grace
A creature of beauty, the lost in time's embrace
With their free hearts we heard legend grows
The new vampire where the midnight rose
Through the veins of the city she moves unseen
A whisper of silk
A phantom queen could touch us all
A kiss, a promise of an eternal night in gaze
Call us of eternal night
In her gaze, death of endless night
Called to wander far from morning's light
She walks in dreams amid freeborn
In curly dark ages warm
A hunger relentless never dies
She dances in madness, a spectral race
A creature of beauty lost in time's embrace
With every heartbeat her legend grows
