When the air feels dry, there's a chill in the night
When the world feels right, that's when you know that there's something wrong
In the end it's the same, don't run away to the Phantom Song
When the smoke stacks rise they've ignited the fire
When the world turns away that's when you know that it's time to fire
In the end it's the same don't look away you've done nothing wrong
They created a lie, it's eating us inside
The situation is dire, don't look away, that is what they want
In the end it's the same, no running away to the Phantom Song
I'm running
Dead all around me
I've been single all deep in the night
I've been single all deep in the night
I'm falling
Deep in the ground
Black phantom sing the lulls deep in the night
Black phantom sing the lulls deep in the night
Tonight your time is up
The phantom has arrived to collect your soul
The time has come to push your luck
He strikes from behind like flies from above
His taste is sweet
It feeds on blood, tastes from down under
Pleasure's filled with love, your mind is quick
But your feet grows up, the devil has arrived to collect your soul
I know the world is slick
While our minds are cost with all that is wrong
I think I'm feeling sick
My time is up
The damage is done
Black phantoms lurk between the cracks
Their fingers sharp as needles
I think I'm feeling sick
My time is up
The damage is done
What makes a difference?
You are linked with control
But then I'm single all deep in the night
But then I'm single all deep in the night
You think I'm faceless
I think I'm out of my mind
Black venom sing the low deep in the night
Black venom sing the low deep in the night
What makes a difference
You are just a leech on my skin
Black venom sing the low deep in the night
Black venom sing the low deep in the night
Your feel is tasteless
Just like this ghost serene
Black Phantom sing the low deep in the night
Black Phantom sing the low deep in the night
I'm running, they're all around
Black Phantom sing the low deep in the night
Black Phantom sing the low deep in the night
I'm falling
Deep in the ground
Black Phantom sing the lulls deep in the night
Black Phantom sing the lulls deep in the night
Too late, your time is up
The Phantom has arrived to collect your soul
The time has come to push your luck
He strikes from behind, though he flies from above
His taste is sweet, it feeds on blood
Taste from down under
Pleasure still with love
Your mind is quick
But your feet froze up
The devil has arrived
To collect your soul
