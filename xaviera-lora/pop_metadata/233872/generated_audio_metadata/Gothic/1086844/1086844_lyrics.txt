It feels good
Away from everyone
Just by myself
I have been safe
When I'm alone
In where I want to be
When I'm alone
It's dark outside, the air is cold
I feel good inside, the rain falls heavier now
Silence all around, except the rain
Falls to the ground, and someone crying
It's cold, but I'm warm
Standing in the shadows
Graves are set by fate
I'm alone
It feels good
Away from everyone
Just by myself
I'm sorrow, it's not the rain
It falls to the ground
I saw one crying
