So I roll back, underground
Rebuker of blasphemy powder
I deny it all, world will be mine
There's no such thing as perfect
True messiah, it is broken
All minds are broken
It's time to wake up the sloth
Photos, cars, smoking shots
Killing all on a thin channel
Flask, soda, sheds, we've passed the rubble
Photos, cars, smoking shots
Killing all on a thin channel
Flask, soda, sheds, we've passed the rubble
Can't say I'm not an old man
Some of my faith and essence comes in the end
Break your walls, let us grow
You were the highest for me
Dominate with wickedness
Raising your mind upon the rise of man
Living in your subconsciousness
As an escape from reality
Time will mend, remove them
Remarkable bits with powder
Mists of sand, stream of life
Superstire, rain of smoke and
Full of scars, smoking shots
Killing all on a tin can of glass
Soda shots with bags of rubbles
Full of scars, smoking shots
Killing all on a tin can of glass
Soda shots with bags of rubbles
