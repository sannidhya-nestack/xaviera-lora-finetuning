It's so predictable
Left your thoughts outside your mind
You're bending backwards
You're always wasting time knowing
You're not in this
You lost yourself in this empty room
It's inconceivable
How every heart aches and lies
It's overbearing
Is no one listening?
The mind wanders, chasing problems
At night you're lost in this empty mood
I've had this feeling in my gut so long I barely notice
I've heard this ringing in my ears so loud I'm lost, I'm focused
Even if you'd ever try your heart is weak and so is mine, so cold
You cheat inside yourself
The weary world you've left behind
It's always raining
Ohio's freezing
There's no winter
Movie sun sets
You can't find hope if you can't find truth
I've had this feeling in my guts so long I barely notice
I've heard this ringing in my ears so loud
Lost on focus even if you'd ever try
Your heart is weak and so is mine so cold
So predictable
You left your thoughts outside your mind
You're bending backwards
You're always wasting
You're always wasting time
You're always wasting
You're always wasting time
You're always wasting time
