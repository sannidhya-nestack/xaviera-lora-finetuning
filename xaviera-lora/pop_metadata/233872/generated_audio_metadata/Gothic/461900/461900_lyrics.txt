Say a prayer for the sinners
Save the ones that you love
I'm the son of the master of one
You better say a prayer for yourself
Am I evil?
Yes I am
Don't give a damn
Take the evil out of heaven
And take an angel out of hell
I'm the damned, I'm the killer of man
An angel dressed in black and white
Am I evil?
Yes, I am
Don't give a damn
Husband of the Mother of God, Guardian of the Virgin.
Don't need no bible, don't see no god
Don't want no money, don't need no rock
Don't see no evil, but the preacher said
If you don't want to die, then you can
