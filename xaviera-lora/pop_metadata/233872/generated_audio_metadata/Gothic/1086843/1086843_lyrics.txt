On Sunday morning to see that girl
The sky's rejoiced, I don't get it at all
Eyes raised up and I've been dead
With only remembrance in their heads
They've burnt my patience to the death
They've blinded me with their Sunday best
A wine, a settle, a father's statue
Existing in their frame of nature
Frame of nature
Frame of nature
Burning on the inside
Break out
A mundane life, it's cute and frail
A low destination, nowhere to go
Cold white skin and your path of thought
A mindless media, what have you got?
This loot by nations to the death
The wind is blind, let's walk, it's undemised
A wild essential for this stature
Existing in their frame of nature
Frame of nature
Frame of nature
The rhythm of nature
Break out
Falling of nature
Falling of nature
Falling of nature
Falling of nature
