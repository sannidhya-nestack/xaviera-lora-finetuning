Never give up, jaded dreams, never give up, silent screams, never give up, teflon shoulders, never give up, tiny boulders, never give up, a day behind, never give up, failing mind, never give up, say hooray, never give up, duvet day
Never give up, pink or blue
Never give up, secret view
Never give up, beautiful day
Never give up, dangerous game
Never give up, candle breeze
Never give up, life or weave
Never give up, watch the rest
Never give up, fail the test
Never look down to the ground
Love everyone who's around
So many people to help you through
Give it all up like you want to do
Break the chains and come on through
A different life is waiting for you
The sun and the sea and the sand all say
Happy red engines are on their way
Here comes the chief of the rainbow tribe
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, heyya, heyya
Hey ya! Hey ya! Hey ya! Hey ya! Hey Ya!
And now happiness has broken out all over the land
The queen is very very happy
Bunny rabbits dancing around
The rainbows are smiling
Their dreams have come true
Never give up
Never give up
Never give up
