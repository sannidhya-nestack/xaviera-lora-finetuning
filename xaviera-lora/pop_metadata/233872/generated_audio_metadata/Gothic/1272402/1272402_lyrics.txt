Golden leaves are falling down
Harvest moon above the ground
Days are drifting losing light
Summer's breath has taken flight
Gathered fruits the wheel has turned
Sunlight flies where candles burn
We embrace the balance near
Maybones dance the end is clear
Cold as gold memories near
A flood of what we gained and lost this year
We sing from a bone, through the turning tide
Celebrate the loss and the gain inside, we were what we've sewn
Let the old year fade, sing from a bone, for the path we made
Fields of amber, skies of grey
Cycles shift, they never stay
What was green is turned in gold
Stories of the year retold
Time of bounce, time of change
In this dance we rearrange
Give and take, the scales sway
Maybarn calls us on our way
Cool this little memory's near
A fuck what we gained and lost this year
We sing for Maybarn
Through the turning tide, celebrate the loss and the gained desire
We rule, we sow, let the old year fade
Sing for my gone, for the path we made
Days of darkness, days of light
Find the balance and make it right
With every change we learn to give
In the ending we learn to live
Through this gloom every reason here
To fuck what we gained and lost this year
We sing for Maybon
Through the turning tide
Celebrate the loss and the gain inside
We rule, we sow
Let the euphoria fade
Sing for Maybon
For the path we made
We sing for Maybon
Through the turning tide
In the balance found we will abide
