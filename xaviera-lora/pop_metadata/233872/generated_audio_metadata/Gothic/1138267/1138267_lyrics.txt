Birds call in the morning, smoke at the lakes
Strike the boys to the parade
First call to us, smoke blood out the gates
Violent storm of release, war is in the skies
Ready for you
When they all say fade away
I just wanna die
To go back in the street
With all the toys
I remember and feel
Driving down the street of my home
And calling it smash
Smash
Smash
Trees
Of its strength
There is a devil's weapon who's been there all
But it's worse than black magic
For the devil to reach but he doesn't hesitate
Only a devil's faith
But to all of the victims
It's only blind
Not proud and blind
Staring for me with new blood
Fishing out the blade
The spirit made of flesh
Rather than blood
Resonance with better words
Stab and stone
But sick as I am
As I am
Striking out the blades
Soft to the skin
That's all there be
Bubble King and Joe
The disease in the vacuum of space
Bodies are burning inside of flames
Blackened and scattered all around me
So many burning children
As we fall
Well, from the sky
The truth falls from the eye
Inside my brain
The craving is
Consumed
It's all in vain
Fire and lake
Screams deep down
Drop down their flames
And throw them into the air
We're the fire
We can't all see the way
We're the sweat of the eye
So nothing in the sky
We're all falling over
Screaming out of breath
Stopped to sleep
And it's through the roof
We're out of choice
Or an impotence cloud
Stomping down the single floor
Impotent smash
Well, let's have our intro still
Now, set a rip off the last riff and you'll see I'm the one
For this last part, like this
For the show, we're doing my thing, don't believe me, please
I'll leave the table quick
Watch out, I'm turning up
You'll enjoy your place
We are villains, coming through with ease
The verdict takes
As long as there's any use
For evidence
Of a bleach-hit flying gun
To the pyroplane
And if I don't show the price
Of all the fighting we wage
They think they're alive but no
We are worse for
On a stone of feather
This one time we pray
For our children we pray
For our children
Let me speak the lie
