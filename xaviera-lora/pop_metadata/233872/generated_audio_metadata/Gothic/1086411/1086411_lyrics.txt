Like an empty cheese and onion crisp I keep caught on the wind
Or like some older inadequate simile I contemplate the state I'm in
Stumbling along with a slight limp as I look on my face
Navigating through darkness by much like falling about the place
From one day to the next
Giving tomorrow a little respect
But times are changing, the tide is shifting away
I've gotta get myself together
I've gotta get myself together
Woah, woah
They dawn on you slowly, the changes, the good and the bad
Next thing I'm telling people, this is not the same as back when I was allowed
And at what point did I start reading the back two pockets of frozen foods
Checking interest rates of credit cards and counting out the years since I left school
From one day to the next
Giving tomorrow a little respect
But times are changing, the tide is shifting away
I've gotta get myself together
I've gotta get myself together
Whoa, whoa
If you look back with no regrets about your past
I'm pretty sure that makes you a sociopath
A slave to his dream sees a tunnel ahead
While seven suffering moths view the moments long dead
To be either of these means your head is in the clouds
And you never get to take a look around
From one day to the next
Giving tomorrow a little respect
But I am changing the tide and shifting away
I've gotta get myself together
I've gotta get myself together
I've gotta get myself together, I've gotta get myself together
