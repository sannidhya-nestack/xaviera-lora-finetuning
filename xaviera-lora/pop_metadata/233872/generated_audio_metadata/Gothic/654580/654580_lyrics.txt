Mama, you gave me air
You gave me shelter, you gave me care
You gave me life I could realize
A place of safety, a place to hide
So why would they give it to you?
Why did they give it to you?
Father, you were never there
And left me thoughts that made me scared
Taught me to hurt and how to hide
So why didn't I give it to you?
Why didn't I give it to you?
Why didn't I give it to you?
Nothing is better to do
What is it good to you?
What is it good to you?
What is it good to you?
Nothing I've been able to do
