Something's rotten in this town
The truth is covered with lies
A thousand stories say mundane
Tell me nothing but lies
Cause I wanna know
Ten thousand friends of mine
Sick of friends in disguise
You're so funny they want more
Kill me now, I'd rather die
So now I gotta go
No hope, no love, no pain, no tears
So numb, so lost, so right, so clear
I'm done, I'm gone, ready to be otten
So love, so right, already otten
No hope, no love, no pain, no tears
So numb, so lost, so right, so clear
I'm done, I'm gone, ready to be otten
So lost, so right, already otten
I'm done, I'm gone, ready to be otten
So lost, so right, already otten
