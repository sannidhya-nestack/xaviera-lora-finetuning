One, two, three, four
Sits in his room playing with his dolls
No one thought of prettiness at all
You won't see him with youth ahead
At those duty bars he wouldn't fall
He's off with those girls
His mom thinks he's gay
His mom thinks he's gay
His mom thinks he's gay
His mom thinks he's a rambler
He receives 10 postcards with those creepy guys who know when his mom sees him she cries
But passion for males is all it ever seemed
Now in his life he can't be redeemed
His mom thinks he's gay
His mom thinks he's gay
His mom thinks he's gay
His mom thinks he's a flamer
His mom thinks he's gay
His mom thinks he's a flamer
There's more things to say
His mom thinks she's gay (His mom thinks she's gay)
His mom thinks she's gay (His mom thinks she's gay)
His mom thinks she's gay (His mom thinks he's gay)
His mom thinks she's no flavor
