To silent walls to tell no tale
Cracks that trace a big trail
Faded murals, colors drained
Worn out symbols that remain
Echoes lingered in empty halls
Where the silence slowly crawls
Once a fortress strong and grand
Now it crumbles into sand
Crumbling edifice
Falling down silent voices
Lost in this ghost town
Crumbling edifice
On sacred ground
Once they stood tall
Now they're breaking down
Shattered glass broken stone
Monuments to what's unknown
Ghostly structures, hollow frames
Trapped in endless words games
Memories like fractured glass
Pieces of the otten past
Rising high they touch the sky
Only to watch them slowly die
Crumbling edifice falling down
Silent voices lost in this ghost town
Crumbling edifice on sacred ground
Once they stood tall now they're breaking down
Time overroads what hands have made
All the glories fade and fade
Foundations crack, facades deceive
The ruins left for us to grieve
Crumbling edifice falling down
Silent voices lost in this ghost town
Crumbling edifice on sacred ground
Once they stood tall now they're breaking down
And in the dust we see it clear
Where once was strong is no longer here
Crumbling edifice the final sound
Echoes of dreams that once were found
