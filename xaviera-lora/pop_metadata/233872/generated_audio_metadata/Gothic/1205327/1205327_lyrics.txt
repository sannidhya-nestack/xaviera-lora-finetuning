I need to get away
I need to find my home
I'm so close
But never felt so far
All I know
I never felt so sure
All my young
I never felt so sure
On my own
That spark goes left to right
We'd leave it all behind
And I hope
I need you close to me
All I know
I've never been so unsure
On my own
I've never been so unsure
On my own
I've never been so unsure, all my young
I've never claimed I'm the cure, all my young
I've never wanted this way, all my young
I've never been so unsure, all my young
I'm walkin' the bull, go, bull, go, cow, cow, for the (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm walkin' the bull, go, bull, go, cow, cow, for the (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm walkin' the bull, go, bull, go, cow, cow, for the (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm walkin' the bull, go, bull, go, cow, cow, for the (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm walkin' the bull, go, bull, go, cow, cow, for the (oh, oh)
I'm walking the bulgo bulgo
Out out for the up up up up
I'm walking the bulgo bulgo
Out out for the up up up up
I'm walking the bulgo bulgo
Out out for the up up up up
I met an old wise man walking in a street
He had no worries that were holding him down
He looked concerned as he gazed on me
Clearly he saw some demons lurking around
You are so tired that you scream at night
Are you afraid of what you might really see
Just rest your head in those tired arms
Release your dark thoughts into your dreams (I'm walking the bulgo bulgo, out out for the) (I'm walking the bulgo bulgo, out out for the) (I'm walking the bulgo bulgo, out out for the)
Release your dark secrets into the night (I'm walking the bulgo bulgo, out out for the)
I'm walkin' the bull, go, go, go, out, out for the
I'm walkin' the bull, go, go, go, out, out for the
I'm walkin' the bull, go ,go, go, out, out for the
