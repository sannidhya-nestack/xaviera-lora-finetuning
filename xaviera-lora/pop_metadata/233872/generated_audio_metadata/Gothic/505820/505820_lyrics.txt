So much for this past I held on to
One million goodbyes that I stumbled and slept through
I'm opening up to new ways of thinking
I'm learning to live without others opinions
And I'm not bitter anyway
I've learned to live without these things
I'm asking you nicely
There's no time so listen
You're holding your breath
And we're running in circles again
Around the world and back again
Feeding off your only friend
Dying old habits
I'm dying in your arms
I fail to see the point of this
Picking back your best defense
Luring in the victim
I give in to the charm of denial
It's killing all the while
But now that it's over
I'm lost and I miss you again
So here's to the heartaches and headaches
The fallouts, the comebacks, the stagnants and stalemates
You're loathing your nights, you can't stop the fire
Don't worry tonight, there's no truth in their lies anyway
So fade out, don't think about
Every situation, and all you've come to doubt
Elucidating your tie, it's glowing out your eyes
You're holding back yourself, now there's nowhere to hide
Around the world and back again, feeding off your only friend
Dying over habits, I'm dying in your arms
I fail to see the point of death, speaking back your best defense
Luring in the victim, I give in to the charm of denial
It's killing all the while
But now that it's over
I'm lost and I miss you again
And I'm not bitter anyway
Around the world and back again
I'm dying of old habits
I'm dying in your arms
I fail to see the point of this
Picking back your best offense
Luring in the victim
I give in to the charm of denial
It's killing all the while
But now that it's over
I'm lost and I miss you again
