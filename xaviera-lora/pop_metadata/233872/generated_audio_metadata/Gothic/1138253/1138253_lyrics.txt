I fell asleep on the beach and
I woke up in hell
I fell asleep on cell phones
I woke up in somebody else
I fell asleep on the beach and
I woke up in hell
I stare into mirrors but I don't see myself
I just wanna get some sleep why won't you let me be at peace
Take me away wash over me why won't you let me breathe
I just wanna get some sleep why won't you let me be at peace
Words don't mean anything why won't you let me be just let me be
Just let me be
I fell asleep on the beach and
I woke up in hell
I fell asleep myself but
I woke up in somebody else
I fell asleep on the beach and
I woke up in hell
I wrote out my name
But I don't know who I am
I just wanna get some sleep why won't you let me be at peace
Take me away wash over me why won't you let me breathe
I just wanna get some sleep why won't you let me be at peace
What's so needed is it why won't you let me be just let me be
Just let me be
Imagine this is me, standing at the top of a cliff, there's a bright new world raging inside of me, raging inside of me
But then I get pushed off and all I see is a thousand foot drop and when I hit the bottom it's gonna hurt like hell, gonna hurt like hell
I've got a devil on both shoulders
They're telling me it's a fool
They're telling me I mean nothing at all (nothing at all)
The only impact I'm gonna make on this world is that of a man
With a stone of mouth to fall from the feet
Cause he couldn't stand on his own two feet
I just wanna get some sleep why won't you let me be at peace
Take me away wash over me why won't you let me breathe
I just wanna get some sleep why won't you let me be at peace
Was no meaning if it why won't you let me be just let me be
I just wanna get some sleep why won't you let me be at peace
Take me away wash over me why won't you let me breathe
I just wanna get some sleep
Why won't you let me be at peace
Words don't mean anything
Why won't you let me be
Just let me be
I fell asleep on the beach then
I woke up and I woke up
I fell asleep myself first
I woke up as the body counts
Fell asleep on the beach then
I woke up and I woke up
I felt like I was dead but
I'm still breathing
