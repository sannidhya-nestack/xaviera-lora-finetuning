The beliefs they change like we do too
Every golden vow turns out untrue
We spoke of love as the fire burned
Now the cold set skin and I'm left to learn
Tangled words beneath the sky
Used for forever but I watched it die
Promises float on a brittle breeze
Like autumn's song they fade with ease
Do you feel the chill, the bite in the wind
As everything ends where it once began
Falling down, we're losing ground
Our terminal promise is nowhere to be found
We have gone and died but the season's cruel
Feel like we're playing the fool
Oh oh oh we fall
Oh oh oh we fall
The amber glow, I see the past
Echoes of a love that couldn't last
We built our dreams on brittle leaves
Now they crumble with the slightest breeze
You said the rain would wash it clean
But the storm came in and stole the scene
Now every vow is a dying breath
Caught in the dance of love and death
Do you feel the chill, the bite and the wind
As everything ends where it once began
Falling down, we're losing ground
Our jungle promise is nowhere to be found
We ever come in tight but the season's cruel
Feel like we're playing fool
Oh oh oh fall
Oh oh oh fall
Oh, fall in death, colors fade to grey
All the things we didn't say
Are written in the sky above
Silent eulogies of love
Falling down, losing ground
Our time, no promise, nowhere to be found
The hour dawns, I cut the seasons cool
Feeling like a clay and food
Oh oh oh we fall
Oh oh oh we fall
Fall into autumn wind, I hear your name
But all that's left is the ghost of blame
Oh oh oh oh oh oh we fall
Oh oh oh oh oh we fall
Caught in the storm, we lost it all
