In the silence of dawn I wander
Chasing echoes of fading through
Through corridors of empty hunger
Searching for a way to feel
Can't escape this spiral, falling under
Losing grip as I descend
Chains that bind me, cold as thunder
Will this journey ever end?
Glances blur like ghosts otten
Voices call from distant shores
Every step feels so uncertain
As I stumble through these doors
Can't escape this spiral, pulling under
Losing grip as I descend
Chains that bind me, cold as thunder
Will this journey ever end?
Chases blood like ghosts otten
Voices call from distant shores
Every step feels so uncertain
As I stumble through these doors
Can't escape this spiral, pulling under
Losing grip as I descend
Chains that bind me, cold as thunder
Will this journey ever end?
Can't escape this spiral, pulling under
Losing grip as I descend
Once I drank off liberation
Now I'm bound by my own hands
In the cycle of temptation
Breaking free from sinking sense
Can't escape this spiral crawling under
Losing grip as I descend
Chains that bind me cold as thunder
Will this journey ever end?
