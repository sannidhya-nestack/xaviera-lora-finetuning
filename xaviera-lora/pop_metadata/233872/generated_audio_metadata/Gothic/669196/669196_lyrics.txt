You can't kill the dead, I'm coming back for you, Carmelus, return
otten but not gone
Lost, silenced, still strong
Light trickles through this grave
As I make my escape
You can't kill the dead
I'm coming back for you
Carmelus, return
In shadows where you walk
Your footsteps have
I'll stop
Invade your dreams
Scream my name
Memories will get the blame
You can't kill the days
I'm coming back for you
Carmilla's return
From my kiss, none can see
Come in love, burning in your face
Torn between temptation, terror
Enslaved to me this time forever
Oh, you're a betrayal easy to et
Once chained in my arms again
My castle on your knees
You can't kill the dead, I've come back for you
Darmin last returns because I love you
