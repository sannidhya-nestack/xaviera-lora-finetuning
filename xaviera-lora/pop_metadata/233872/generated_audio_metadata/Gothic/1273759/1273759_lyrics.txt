In the crypt where we buried our lies I saw the truth behind your eyes
Promises like faying scars
Lost between the distant stars
You turned away and let me bleed
The bitter taste of your misdeed
Echoes of your lies repeat
The bond we had now incomplete
You walked a room I thought was real
But every step you'd conceal
The threads of trust began to fray
Unraveling with each new day
You turn away and let me bleed
The bitter taste of your misty
Echoes of your lies repeat
The all we had now incomplete
We walked a road I thought was real
But every step you'd conceal
The threads of trust began to fray
Unraveling with each new day
Turn away and let me bleed
The bitter taste of your misty
Echoes of your lies repeat
The bond we had now incomplete
Now I stand on shattered ground
Silence is the only sound
Lessons learned, pages turned
From your betrayal I have earned
You turn away and let me bleed
The bitter taste of your misdeed
Echoes of your lies repeat
The bond we had now incomplete
