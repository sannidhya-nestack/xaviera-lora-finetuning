Country boy with a guitar in his hand
He travelled far across this land
Documents everything he sees
The songs of brutal honesty and
He takes a stand
He draws a line in the sand
He assumes his principles
But never sells it out
And now he's singing
This machine kills fascists
Yes he's singing
This guitar killed fascists, small town in depression times
There were no hope, just blighted lives, a harsh and violent hateful place
They thought black gold their saving grace, but the old men came
They took everything, they stripped the whole town bare
And then they went again, now he's singing (la la la)
This machine killed fascists, yes he's singing (la la la)
This guitar kills fascists, now they're heading for
The quiet depression of the 21st century
The clampdown's happening, so where can we find Moody God 3 now?
You know these songs of liberty
This land belongs to you and me
But no, don't get it the other way
There's no poor black, you've got no say and
You went to war
It was like the racist days
And then he came back home
Found the same thing there
And now he's singing
Let's machine kill fascists
Yes he's singing
Let's get our kill fascists
Now it's a head and fall
The great depression of the 21st century
The countdown's happening
So where can we find Woody Guthrie now?
