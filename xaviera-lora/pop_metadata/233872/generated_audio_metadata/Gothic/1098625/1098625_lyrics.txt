I know it's over now and I could never know
What's happened all along the way I see
The future laid out before on the table
But it's over now
It's time to sleep
God it's over now
What's the pinnacle of the love death?
Nothing cynical, just a lot of sweat
Let the devil go, someone's out here
Just start to kill it, and then maybe kill it
I am not over
Touch the earth
Touch the earth and far away
Ten cards and a bottle of whiskey
Never like I say in my room
And you are falling down what gave me a bracelet
With my name and number
Craving the world
Counting steps through every hour
