Can you see what we've become when we lose humility
So divine yet troublesome disregard humanity
As I watch the world go by
All I do is wonder why
Has it all just been a lie?
Hope can light the darkness
It can spread fast, infect the masses
Hope will cost you nothing
But so precious, you think it's priceless
Come on rise up from the pain, what are you afraid of?
Things will always stay the same, unless you can stay above
Go ahead and take a chance
It is time to take a stance
You just might find some romance
Look into this empty void
Tell me what you see in him
Not a dream he won't destroy
Why should you believe in him
Give an inch he'll take a mile
His behavior is so vile
Look at you you're in denial
Fear will feed the darkness
It can spread fast just like a virus
Fear leaves you with nothing
Not so fresh as you think it's worthless
