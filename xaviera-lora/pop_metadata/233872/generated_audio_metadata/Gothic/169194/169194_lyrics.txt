I'm looking for something evil or something I can't talk about
Yeah I'm looking for something baby
Something that'll make me shout
Stick a pen up in my eye
Tell me if you feel my pain
Write a note up in my mind
Tell me if you feel the same
Destiny tells me what to do
You're killing me, I'm killing you
Mirror mirror can you see
Can you see just what I am
My taste for murder, my craving for blood
The suicidal future of man
I like to find the truth in lies
every lie hides the truth inside
When the beast in me tells me what to do
You're killing me
I'm killing you
I'm killing you
I'm killing you
I'm killing you boy, I'm killing
Some people even the president of the United States of America has made mention of the battle of Armageddon
The people in the White House, in the Senate, they've all talked about the battle of Armageddon
Everywhere people are aware of it, even in Russia, they know about the battle of Armageddon
The son of man, the son of man I am, come and let's confront your fears
I've pledged allegiance to the national flag
Now we need a national clear
You've shed the darkness that I feel
I've shed the reasons why I kill
If I'm your devil let's make a deal
Give me your heart, it's all I will steal
Confused in me, it tells me what to do
You're killing me, I'm killing you
The beast in me tells me what to do
You're killing me, I'm killing you
I'm killing you, I'm killing you
I'm killing you, I'm killing
I'm killing you, I'm killing
I'm killing you
