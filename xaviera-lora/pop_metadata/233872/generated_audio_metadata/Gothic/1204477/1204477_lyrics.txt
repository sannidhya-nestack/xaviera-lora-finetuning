My mind's like a cat in an alleyway
You must be a sad to see
I'm running like a car down the freeway
The dogs are right upon me
You reach me
Disposed of the lie
You'll be the key, sir
My mind's like a cat in a netherware
You must be sad to see
I'm running like a god in a freeway
The dogs are proud to own me
You reach
In which you lose
The smell of dead or alive
In which the cure sells
