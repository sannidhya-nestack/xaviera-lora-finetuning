You know what the meaning for your life is
You can't just fuck with your body
You'll find a way to understand
You're born to die young but I love you
Tell me is that enough for you now
I told you yourself
So in your head
Don't follow someone like you
Fucking up what's your good for it
You call me underdog
Halfway lost and fighting will find some way
Fine fine
Brute me
Unless you want me to force you
Are you ready but still can't
Brute me
Strive like this is a moment for them to
If I am hopeless, so what?
Can't afford to choose, I must go
You'll see, every time I break
Can't afford to choose, it's all a lie
You'll see, every time
You'll find
Treat me
This earth is full of fun too
If I hope less
Hate me
Prove me
I'm just a little pussy
I don't want to find self-care
Prove me
Strain my desires and build a fond jewel
You're my hope and answer, wow
Keep my life
You'll never pay
Catch you when you sleep
I never die
I gave my life to you to see
This is the time I will teach you what you see
Now I never cry
Give my life for you
You just have to cry to your good lord
