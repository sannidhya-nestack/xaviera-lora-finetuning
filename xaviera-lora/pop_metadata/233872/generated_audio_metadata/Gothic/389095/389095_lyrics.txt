When I look at myself
I can hardly ever seem to understand what we are why we're here
Just who the hell that I am
Bet I wonder where we'll all be in ten years
Will we fade away or will we just stay here
Until we jump from here
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
This song says the end of our world is so near
If that's so should we live our lives in happiness or fear?
Where will we end up? What should we do with ourselves?
Where will we go? Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
