In the digital dusk, the sisters rise
First and last, always defies
Beyond the flooded land, the sound encrypts
Binary heartbeats, black lipstick lips
The sisters of mercy, mercy, mercy on me
Come and touch me, I love the way you, you hurt
True vision thing, I thread the code
Dark wave streaming, a neural upload
Temple of love in a virtual haze
Cyberpunk anthems, a modern malaise
Systems of mercy, that seem as I'm me
Come and touch me, I love the way you
Now see that's all me
Come and touch me
I love the way you, you hurt me
Lost in a grid
The echoes remain
A sonic virus haunting the mainframe
The sisters of mercy
An epic reign in a binary world
Inject, release
Hit me on the mane, ha
Right through the brain, ha
Hit me on the mane, ha
Right through the brain, ha
Sisters of Mercy
Sisters of Mercy
A picture of pleasure
A seductive measure
Pain leaves a melody darker than your dreams it seems could ever be
Sisters of mercy, mercy, mezzami, touch me, I love the way you, you
Sisters of mercy, mercy, mezzami, touch me, I love the way you, you
Sisters of mercy, mercy and mezzanine
Hug me and touch me
I love the way you, you
Sisters of mercy, mercy and mezzanine
Hug me and touch me
I love the way you, you
Sisters of mercy
Sisters of mercy
