Bring my breath to rise up high
Iron teeth against the sky
Grinding down the bones of days
Turning ours into haze
Factory fire burn and glow
Fading armor we let go
Indious walls are tied stand still
Cogs against the new satanic mills
Soaked words out like old regrets
We're caught in wheels we can't et
We walk in the new satanic mills
Turning dreams into endless drills
We find a way, we pay the price
In the new satanic mills with sacrifice
You let stone the master's reign
Pain made eyes behind the pain
Building up the grand designs
Burgers, reds, and air-cut signs
Criminals whispered in crowd
Feeding on what we let go
In these walls of time stand still
Cogs against leaves, satanic mills
So poor it sounds like old regrets
We're caught in wheels we can't et
We walk in the new satanic mills
Turning dreams into endless fails
You clock away, we pay the price
And the new satanic growth we sacrifice
Steel and stone the masters reign
Gleaming eyes behind the pain
Building up the grand designs
Were the threads in their confines
Crimson rivers underground
Silenced dreams without a sound
Trapped inside these iron wells
Turning round the new satanic mills
Smoke pours out like bitter sighs
We're just gears in half disguise
We want the new satanic mills
Turning dreams into endless drills
We climbed the lake
We paid the price
To the new satanic notes we sacrificed
But if time are cutting deep
Through the chains we thought we'd keep
They build us up to tear us down
We're the ones who wear the crown
The light we had is growing dim
But we still keep marching in
We want the new satanic mills
Turning dreams into endless trails
We cry the way
We pay the price in the new satanic hills
We sacrifice
We walk
We cry
We burn
We build
We walk in the new satanic hills
