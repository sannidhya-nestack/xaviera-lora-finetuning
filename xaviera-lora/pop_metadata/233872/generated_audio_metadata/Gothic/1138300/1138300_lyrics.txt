Take a seat at my window once we'll combine
We will never feel safe however hard we try
Stealing, stealing, we've been fighting for the free
People think that they've been robbed at by the police
The streets aren't safe, filled up with hate, and I'm aside
I've fought all fear, it keeps me here, away from my kind
The streets are unsafe, filled up with hate, and none of my side
I fucked all of them, it keeps me a kid, away from the kind, that kind
Violence, darkness, streets and walls were filled with light
How the fuck don't these kids know they're a fuck right
Future world and self respect are not the norm
Don't stay locked once we all bleed, can't cry out the song
Street's all insane, filled up with hate, you're not on my side
My foot don't fit, it keeps me in here, away from mankind
The streets are unsafe, filled up with hate, and now I'm beside
My foot don't fit, it keeps me in here, away from mankind
Mankind
[Silence]
[Silence]
