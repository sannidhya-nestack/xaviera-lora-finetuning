So now it's sexual
Guilty and beautiful
It could be for us
Once in the morning, threw you apart
Flirt with regret, back to the start
As we roll this over
And this is the way we rationalize
Hide in the background, well-loved so tightly
It hurts
Somehow it's sexual
Caught up in chemicals
We could be friends
Somehow it's sexual
Guilty and beautiful
We could be friends
We could be friends
Are we safe
Are we true
We'll keep running, are we safe? Are we true?
I won't keep running back
I won't keep running back
I won't keep running back
I won't keep running back
I won't keep running back
I won't keep running back
I won't keep running back, I won't keep running back, I won't keep running back, I won't keep running back ,I won't keep running back, I won't keep running back
Somehow exceptional
Colour-coded chemicals
Make a difference
