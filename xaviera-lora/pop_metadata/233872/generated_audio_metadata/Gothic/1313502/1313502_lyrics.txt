Silken whispers tangled in my ear
Secrets woven pulling me near
Smoke in the earth, blur the line
Lost inside illusions hard to define
You spin me softly in endless dreams
Holding memories, staring at seams
Chasing echoes, words left unsaid
Fading gently, lost in my head
Can't escape, bound by design
Drawn to darkness, that's your divide
Wrapped in your black silk disguise
Caught within your midnight lies
Pull me close, I compromise
Lost inside your black silk disguise
Your voice lingers like perfume smoke
Twisted truth you use, you softly provoke
Mirror shatter, clothes decay
Yet I'm longing, begging to stay
Endless spirals lead me astray
Echoed whispers won't fade or aid away
Feel your secrets slide through my veins
Draw me deeper, bound by your chains
Black soup disguise, pull me near
Haunted whisper my ears
Wrapped in your black silk disguise
Caught in memories, no surprise
Found the secrets hypnotized
Forever lost in black silk skies
And your dark teeth indicting blackened tie-dye
Frank disguise
Black disguise
Drifting away
Secrets hidden, I can't betray
Surrendered softly, truth in your lies
Forever held in your silk disguise
