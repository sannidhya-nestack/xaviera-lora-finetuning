Staring through the glass, the world so cold
Painted smiles on faces old
Promises of gold, they glisten bright
In a world of black and white
Every step I take it pulls me in
Fading dreams and porcelain skin
I reach out but it's all for show
Gilded hope how you glow
Gilded hope
Shining lights
Hiding truth behind your eyes
We're all falling for the prize
Killed it whole in disguise
Silent through the glass, the world's so cold
Painted smiles on faces old
Promises of gold, they glisten bright
In a world of black and white
Every step I take it pulls me in
Fading dreams and porcelain skin
I reach out but it's all for show
Gilded hope how you glow
Gilded hope
Shining lies, hiding truth behind your eyes
We're all falling for the prize, gilded hope in disguise
Silent lips they sell the game
Broken hearts they take the blame
In the maze of what we crave
Lost in what we try to save
Every word they speak it's all a play
Chasing rainbows shades of grey
I reach out but it's all for show
Gilded hope how you glow
Gilded hope shining lights
Hiding truth behind your eyes
We're all falling for the prize
Guilded hope in disguise
We build these castles made of air
Clinging to what isn't there
Falling fast we close our eyes
Caught beneath your velvet skies (Guilded hope)
Slipping through, still I reach, still I choose
Guilded hope I'm holding on to
The promise to the dawn
