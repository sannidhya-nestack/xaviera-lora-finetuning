Here's a one, a two, a one, two, three, four
Well here's a message for all you better people
The Black Detective's really wearing thin
I'm tired of watching all you better people
You're dancing around and clowning around and getting paid
I hope the way in which you judge us ugly
Was all that I even had made some sense
It's weird the way we worship pretty people
It's weird me out, it's weird me out, now go away
So are you fucked up, pretty people
Just take your cash and go
So while you talk, don't blow that up, people
Keep going, you'll blow
It's all in how you know and who you fuckin' blow
Pretty people
Yes, that's for you, pretty people
Pretty people
Yes, that's for you, pretty people
You don't look down on citizens, gated doorways
They help to keep us fuckin' losers out
I hope the shield and screw the blouse are painless
Don't have to bother now when I don't have relevance
But here's your jigger all you pretty people
I wish my life was half as good as yours
I hope the fact that I'm not pretty people
Inside of my mind I'm half in the bag it's such a drag
So are you fucked up pretty people
Just take your cash and go
So are you drugged up, brother playboy
Keep doing your blow
It's all in hell you know, in hell you fucking blow
Such a brother time
Such a brother life you laid on
Such a brother face
That seems the heights are sure to haunt us all
Haunt us all, haunt us all, haunt us all
Pretty people, yes ask for your pretty people
Pretty people, yes ask for your pretty people
Millions and millions of bread and paper
Just having the time of their lives
Millions and millions of bread and paper
Locking down on you and I
Millions and millions of breaded people
Just having the time of their lives
Millions and millions of breaded people
Looking down on you and I
Millions and millions
Blood out pipe all just having the time of their lives
Millions and millions of blood out pipe are looking down on you and I
Millions and millions of proud-ass people
Just having the time of their lives
Millions and millions of proud-ass people
