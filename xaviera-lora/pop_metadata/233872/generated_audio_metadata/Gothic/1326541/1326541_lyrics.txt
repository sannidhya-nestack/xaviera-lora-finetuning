Doors breathe white when dusk is near
Steamwright stories in the air
Porcelain so pale and thin
Pours the night we drink within
Silver spoons tap porcelain lips
Every pulse in tiny sip
Coffin Cafe, keep me awake
Pour the dark'til the morning breaks
Sip by sip we calibrate
Every whisper resonates
Coffin Cafe, stay in my veins
Stir the hush that forever remains
Clock can tick but we won't sway
Coffin Cafe
Never fade away
Laughing low in curtain nooks
Trading spells instead of books
Balcony of iron curve
Holds the secrets we deserve
Silver spoons tap porcelain lips
Every pulse in tiny sips
Coffin Cafe, keep me awake
Pour the dark'til the morning breaks
Sip by sip we calibrate
Every whisper resonates
Coffin Cafe, stay in my veins
Stir the hush that forever remains
Clock can tick but we won't sway
Coffin Cafe
Never fade away
Steam crowns rise, halo of haze
Taste of ash and sugared glaze
Tongue confess in bitter rhyme
Coffin cups suspend the time
Coffin cafe, keep me awake
Pour the dark'til the morning breaks
Sip by sip we calibrate
Every whisper resonates
Coffin cafe, stay in my veins
Stir the hush that forever remains
Clock can tick but
We won't sway
Coffin Cafe
Never fade away
Coffin Cafe
Never fade away
