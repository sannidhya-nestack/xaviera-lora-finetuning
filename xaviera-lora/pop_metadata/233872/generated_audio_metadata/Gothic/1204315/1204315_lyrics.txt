I want to know your secret
You know I hold'em well
I want to know your desire
Let's let the world buy
Let's let the world buy
She wants to hold me close
She wants to know the most
When I look into her eyes I see a mesh mystery
I want to know your secret
You know I hold'em well
I want to know your desire
Let's let the world buy
I want to know your secrets
You know I hold them well
I want to know your desire
Let's light the world on fire
I want to rise with your tide
And learn your ocean spells
Break away my heart calypso
And calm the waters down
Break away my heart calypso
And calm the waters down
Break away my heart, Calypso
Here come the waters, Dan
You were out of time
You were out of time
You are out of time
I want to know your secret
You know I hold them well
I want to know your desire
Let's make the world burn
I want to rise with your tide
And learn your ocean spells
Break away my heart calypso
And calm the waters down
I want to know your secret
You know I hold them well
I want to know your desire
Let's make the world mine
I want to rise with you time
And learn your ocean spells
Break away my heart, Calypso
And come to water's end
Break away my heart, Calypso
And come to water's end
Break away my heart, Calypso, and come to understand
