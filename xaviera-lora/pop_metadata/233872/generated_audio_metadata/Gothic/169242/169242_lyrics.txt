Yeah
Well I'm a seven foot lover with a ten inch gun
I'm looking for some action, I'm looking for some fun
I'm packing double barrels, got a knife in my hand
I'm a switchblade of terror, I'm a demionic man
There's no use in running, there's nowhere to hide
No one to protect you once I get inside
Let me sing you a sad song, crying too little
I'm the master of murder, a cat on the prowl
Pull me under, let's do it again
I'm the master of darkness, and I'm a demon within
Come and let me tell you of a story never told
A story never written of the safest in lost souls
Some people call it heaven, some people call it hell
But if you choose you might just lose and never live to tell
Easy come and easy go, way it's going to end
Right between the day and night, that's my only friend
So if you look through night sky then you'll see the blood blue and red
There's the umbrella too, you'll surely still be dead
Roll me over and turn me around
I'm the master of murder, a cat on a prowl
Pull me under and let's do it again
I'm the master of darkness
Yeah, I've been feeling like that
Roll me over and turn me around
I'm the master of murder, a cat on the prowl
Only I know that you're in here
I'm the master of darkness
You know I'm a demon within
Human is a cheater babe
Ask an angel for help
Stick your fingers deep within and feel the heat beneath my skin
A bit of passion feels no pain
You make me think that you're a slave
Keep my soul in you alone
Kill me first, don't let go
I'm a demon within
I'm a demon within
I'm a demon
I'm a demon within
A demon
I'm a demon within
I'm a demon in hell, I'm a demon in hell
