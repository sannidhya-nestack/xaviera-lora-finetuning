I am not from England, but where I live it
I'm a proud Yorkshire man, but that's a waste it
Wear the white rose and it makes me proud
Tell the Yorkshire man, turn it in the crowd
Yorkshire buns born on bread, it's on the arm (skid head)
Yorkshire buns born on bread, it's on the arm (skid head)
Yorkshire buns born on bread, it's on the arm (skid head)
Yorkshire buns born on bread
Breathe of our own as we stand together
Vision of our fathers and we'll be forever
Speak a different language that no one knows
Keep our secrets from the foes
Youngstrap buns, born on bread, song in the arms (skihead)
Youngstrap buns, born on bread, song in the arms (skihead)
Youngstrap buns, born on bread, song the arms (skihead)
Youngstrap buns, born on bread
I am not from England but where I live it
I'm a proud Yorkshire man but that's the way it's gets
Wear the white rose and it makes me proud
Tell the Yorkshire man standing in the town
Yorkshire buns born on bread, turn the arms to head
Yorkshire buns born on bread, turn the arms to head
Yorkshire buns born on bread, turn the arms, to head
Yorkshire buns born on bread
