Empty rooms and silent halls
The clock ticks but time stands still
Gazing through the frosted glass
The world moves against my will
Isolation wraps around the cloak that's cold and worn
Disconnected from the life where once my soul was born
All these walls are closing in
Can anyone see me here?
Faces pass but none connect
Drowning in this atmosphere
Reaching out but touching none
Under this hollow sky
In this crowd I'm all alone
Watching as the days go by
Empty rooms and silent halls
The clock ticks but time stands still
Gazing through the frosted glass
The world moves against my will
Isolation wraps around
The cloak that's cold and worn
Disconnected from the life
Where once my soul was born
All these walls are closing in
Can anyone see me here?
Faces pass when none connect
Drowning in this atmosphere
Reaching out but touching none
Under this hollow sky
In this crowd I'm all alone
Watching as the days go by
City's home with empty eyes
No one stops to say a word
Every sound is muffled now
My voice remains unheard
Trying hard to break the spell
To find a way back home
But distance grows with every step
And I'm still on my own
All these walls are closing in, can anyone see me here?
Faces pass but none connect, drowning in this atmosphere
Reaching out but touching none, under this hollow sky
In this crowd I'm all alone, watching as the days go by
Is there someone out there listening? Can they hear my silent plea?
In this vast and crowded place, is there room for you and me?
All these walls are closing in, can anyone see me here?
Faces pass but none connect, drowning in this atmosphere
Reaching out but touching none, under this hollow sky
In this crowd I'm all alone, watching as the days go by
