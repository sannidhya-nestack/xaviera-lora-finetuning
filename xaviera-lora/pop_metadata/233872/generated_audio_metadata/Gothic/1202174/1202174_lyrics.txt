Musik machen, kein Krieg, ist das, was wir verlieben
Make music, not a crazy walk, maybe that's why
Maybe what she lives for, thinking of both (get over it)
She's a vampire queen of the underworld land
Explore her sinister twisted mind
Whether you enlisted, did good things
Farts of a leather, hoops and chains of a leather
I've fallen in love with your hand on my breast coat
I've fallen in love with your hand on my breast coat
You're Hannibal Resco, a beauty with a bite
Her fashion is a manifesto written by the devil
I've never seen such an amazing socialite
But the lights are flashing red'cause the danger's on the level
That's just a pretty face, she plays a wicked fiddle
Dancing on the strings, boy, get you in the middle
Oh man, she got a wicked plan
Buckle up, throw the wide, welcome to the other side
I fall in love with Hannibal Resco
I fall in love with the hand of a best girl
Ooh, ah, ah, ah
She's a vampire queen of the underworld scene
I can't speak, just a sound, I can't breathe
Ooh, ah, ah, ah
All I need is a piece of a magical trace
All I wanna do is get a piece of your love
You do it like nobody does
And all I really need is a piece
Your style and profile ain't nothin' like them other chicks
I've fallen in love with your Hannibal Resko
I've fallen in love with your Hanna Marasco
I've fallen in love with your Hanna Marasco
I've fallen in love with your Hanna Marasco
Please, don't let me die
