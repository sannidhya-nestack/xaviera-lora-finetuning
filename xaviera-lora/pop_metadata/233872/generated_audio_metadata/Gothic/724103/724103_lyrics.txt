If I'd won the lottery
I'd take a break from isolation
I'd call evacuation of this town
If I ever shot at my dreams
It'd take me one intervalation
One more thing that I have given up
She said I'm sick of talking to people like you
You won't see names up in lights
You won't even make the news
If there's something I'd say
You should speak the truth
But now she's moving away
From a game that I'd lose
And she fell in love with Memphis
Oh she fell in love with Memphis
Oh she fell in love with Memphis
Oh she fell in love with Memphis, oh she fell in love with Memphis
She fell in love with Memphis when Maya came out
If I would've seen this just
I would've quit procrastination
Or break from always looking for the light
If I would've wondered
Is there air that I fell under
I can see her breath is gone, winter night
And all the mistakes come before me
I've never quite gotten them right
I'd send a postcard if I knew that it was worth it
But sometimes it's never worth a try
And she fell in love with Memphis
Oh she fell in love with Memphis
Oh she fell in love with Memphis instead
Oh she fell in love with Memphis
Oh she fell in love with Memphis
She fell in love with Memphis
And why I came out from the pasture
Knew that I'd thrown it away
All these color coded sentences that I ot to say
And the past comes before me if I'd seen it that way
And now these summer nights and ever look so grey
And she fell in love with Memphis
Oh she fell in love with Memphis
Oh she fell in love with Memphis
It's just
Oh, she fell in love with my bass
Oh, she fell in love with my bass
She fell in love with my bass and my heart came out
