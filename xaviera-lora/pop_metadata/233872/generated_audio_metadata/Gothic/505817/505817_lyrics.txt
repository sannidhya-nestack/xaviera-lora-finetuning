Kick me forward, no I won't fall back
Here just for you
Stand outside, is this your own free mind
We'll make it through
Look into your heart again, tell me where the tunnel lands
Look into your heart again, tell me where the tunnel lands
Everything's alright down here, we gotta find our way
It's never been so clear, we gotta turn around
Look into your heart again, tell me where the tunnel lands
Bound in silence
Keep your thoughts inside
This mental cell
Quick and quiet
Start your own life riot
Every ounce of freedom
In your only outbreath
Look into your heart again
Tell me where the tunnel ends
Look into your heart again, tell me where the tunnel lands
Everything's alright down here, we gotta find our way
It's never been so clear, we gotta turn around
Look into your heart again, tell me where the tunnel lands
And even with your best excuse it's plain to see
I've cut you loose and I've given everything I had
Can't expect too much if we don't try
And calling with the best intentions
My hell's about, we're fading out
And I've given everything I had
You've given everything to me
You're part of me, you're therapy
You're everything I'm not
Look into your heart again, tell me where the tunnel lands
Look into your heart again, tell me where the tunnel lands
Everything's alright down here, we gotta find our way
It's never been so clear, we gotta turn around
Look into your heart again, tell me where the tunnel lands
