I'm lost in the dark
I'm right back at the start
And I don't know where I'm going
My mind is broken, I know it
Missing the fear in your eyes
Just hold it close, don't show it
It'll be over before you know it
I'm lost in the dark
I'm right back at the start
It's not you, it has always been me
It's okay, don't you dare follow me
If you go you will never be free
The future holds what we can't always see
I don't know where I'm going
My mind is broken, now it
Messy, the fear in your eyes
Just hold it close, don't show it
It'll be over before you know it
I'm lost in the dark
I'm right back at the start
It's not you, it has always been me
It's okay, don't you dare follow me
If you go, you will never be free
The future holds what we can't always see
I just know what I can't explain
Turn away or you'll always be away
You know that it's the only way
I'm lost and undone
