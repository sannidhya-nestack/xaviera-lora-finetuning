She's alive, she's vile, Miss Frankenstein
Heartless scientists cross the line
Obstructs the level of humanity
The V-Movie bitch that shouldn't be
Open scars, no human trace
But 666, she's escaped
She's alive, she's vile, Ms. Frankenstein
Alive and vile, Ms. Frankenstein
Ms. Frankenstein
Miss Frankenstein
This burning city now her slave
A hungry horror thy screams grieved
In her veins what didn't kill
Crossed her glory and still still
Chains of love are left on the slab
Test of honour at the Monster Mash
She's alive, she's vile, Miss Frankenstein
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Live and vile, Miss Frankenstein
Miss Frankenstein
There's maggots, aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye
Build a monster, tear it down
Build a monster, tear it down
Build a monster, tear it down
Build a monster, tear it down
Grab your pitchforks, gather'round
She's the best truck driver of town
Grab your pitchforks, burn her down
But you can't keep her while she's down
She's alive, she's vile, Ms. Frankenstein
Alive and vile, Ms. Frankenstein
She's alive, she's vile, Ms Frankenstein
Alive and vile, Ms. Frankenstein
Ms. Frankenstein
It's Frankenstein
