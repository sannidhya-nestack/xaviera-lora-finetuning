In the shadows of these ancient walls
Whispers linger as the night befalls
Echoes in this house of flesh
Crying out as we are born afresh
In the abbey of our belly we stand
Do what thou wilt, take my hand
Bound by love and not by law
Here we will what we adore
In the shadows of these ancient walls
Whispers linger as the night befalls
Echoes in this house of flesh
Crying out as we are born afresh
In the army of our belly we stand
Do what thou wilt, take my hand
Bound by love and not by law
Here we will what we adore
Candles flicker in the sacristy
Shards of joy setting spirits free
Dancing in the shadows of the nave
Learning to unlock the desire we crave
In the Abbey of Rabele we stand
Do what thou wilt, take my hand
Bowed by love and not by law
Here we will what we adore
Chantels flicker in the sacrist stream
Chants of joy setting spirits free
Dancing in the shadows of the nave
Learning to unlock the desire we crave
In the abbey of la belle we stand
To what thou wilt take my hand
Thou by law then not by law
Here we will what we adore
While the breaks and shadows fade
All that's left is the vows we made
