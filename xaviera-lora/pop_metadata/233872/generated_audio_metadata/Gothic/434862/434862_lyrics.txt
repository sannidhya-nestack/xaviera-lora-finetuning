What is this? I cannot see
I see hands
Stay cold on me
I am damned, none can tell
I opened the door to heaven and hell
Death, oh death how can it be
That I must come and go with thee
Death, oh death how can it be
I'm unprepared for eternity
I've come for to get your soul
Take your body and leave it cold
I'll drop the flesh from off in your frame
The earth and worms both have their claim
Oh death please give me time
To fix my heart and change my mind
Your mind is fixed
Your heart is bound
I got the shackles
To drag you down
April, come here a sec. Look over across the street. Is he using an electric lawnmower or is he using a gasoline lawnmower? Electric.
I'll lock your jaw so you can't talk
I'll lock your knees so you can't walk
I'll close your eyes so you can't see
Come with me
I am a man of gods and sorrow
I've seen troubles all my days
Mother, mother, come to my bed
Mother, mother, come to my bed
Mother, mother, come to my bed
Put a cold towel upon my head
My head is warm, my feet is cold
Death put shackles on my soul
Not my soul
Not my soul
Death by the shackles of my soul (Take the shackles from my soul)
Death by the shackles of my soul (Take the shackles from my soul)
Death by the shackles of my soul (Take the shackles from my soul)
Death by the shackles of my soul
I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul
I'm my soul, I'm my soul, I'm my soul, damn I get shackles from my soul, damn I get shackles from my soul
(I'm gonna take these shackles from my soul) (I'm gonna take these shackles from my soul)
