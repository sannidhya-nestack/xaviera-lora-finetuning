I see your shame fall from the darkness as my shadow throws light in the heat of the night sky
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
The crosses burn as the nails rip through my flesh
I say what I want
I'd do what I say
They took my eye
But then you threw yours away
Would it be the same if it was your name?
Would it be the same if Jesus was your name?
It's been three long days with the sun on my back
I've got shit by my side and we're still kicking your ass
We've gone a thousand miles and we'll go a thousand more
No one will ever stop us not even little hogs
I say what I want I do what I say
They took my life
But they will take us away
Would it be the same if it was your name?
Would it be the same if Jesus was your name?
I never said I was the savior of man
Instead I was the victim of my circumstance
I never told you all the lies that you tell
And still you made believe that there's an angel in hell
Tell you what I want, I'll do what I say
You took my life, I'll kill you when the fear goes away
Would it be the same if it was your name?
Would it be the same if it was your name
Would it be the same if it was your name
Would it be the same if Jesus was your name?
I'm not like you, I'm not afraid to die
I'm not like you, I have no soul to signify
You speak of holy water, but where do I spit at?
I'm not like you
