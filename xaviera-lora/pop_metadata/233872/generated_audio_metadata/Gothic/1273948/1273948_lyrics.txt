Feel the chains around my skin
Struggling in the state I'm in
Walls are closing, lights grow dim
Echoes fade, the chance is slim
Take me to a place unseen
Far beyond the smoke and screams
Running from the ties that bind
Leave it all behind
Faces blur like distant stars
Counting all the fate I'm in
Reaching for a dawn anew
Knuckles fake, the chance is slim
Take me to a place unseen
Far beyond the smoking screens
Running from the ties that bind me all behind
Faces blur like distant stars
Counting all the fade and scars
Reaching for a dawn I knew
Nothing left here but to lose
Take me to a place unseen
Far beyond the smoke and screams
Running from the ties that bind
Leave it all behind
Faces blur like distant stars
Counting all the faded scars
Reaching for a dawn anew
Nothing left here but to lose
Take me to a place unseen
Far beyond the smoke and screams
Running from the ties that bind
Leave it all behind
Silent cries I can't ignore
Pull me to an open door
Take me to a place unseen
Far beyond the smoke and screams
Running from the ties that bind
Leave it all behind
