Pulled tight just to raise a fade you haven't used
A catatonic state that you've never been to
One gripping all consuming, still filled full of hate
One slow push and your only friend seals your fate
A broken home is all it takes to taint our soul
The path in which the steering is hard to control
Seeks solace in acquaintances hidden by smiles
They gain your trust and hack your legs and drag you for miles
A way of life, a state of mind I'll never know
Grateful for the lesson of where not to go
A heavy heart of memories, the world in my hands
So close to my heart in which you live in the sand
A bottle of pills, a spoonful of pain
Been changing my soul, now I'm waste
A bottle of pills is full full of hate
Tainted my soul, no other ways
A bottle of pills
A spoonful of hate
Tainted our soul
No one waits
A bottle of pills
A spoonful of hate
Changing the soul
No other ways
[Pause]
