Empty lights still flicker on
Music plays, cold dread is gone
Broken masks, otten shears
Echoes of the distant years
Dancers move in a tired sway
Painted smiles begin to fray
Glitter falls where nothing shines
In the space between the lines
Leaves just thinking though it's done
A lonely problem for the one
For long fiestas where the colors fade
We dance in circles, lost in the parade
Laughter's hollow, crowns all gone
For long fiestas but we carry on
Empty lights don't flicker on
Music plays, no joy is gone
Broken masks, otten shears
Echoes of the distant years
Dancers moving in Tyrant's way
Painted smiles, need to be free
Glitter falls, but nothing shines
In the space between the lines
We're still spinning though it's done
A lonely party for the one
Full on fiestas
Where the colors fade
We dance in circles
Lost in the parade
Laughter's home
Crowd's all gone
Full on fiestas
But we carry on
Steady falls like broken rain
Faded banners sweet with pain
Empty tables shattered glass
The revelry that couldn't last
Flashing lights but there's no thrill
Just the silence we can't fill
Parades of ghosts that never show
In this carnival below
We keep spinning in the blur
Chasing what we never were
Forlorn fiestas, where the colors fade
We dance in circles, lost in the parade
Laughter's hollow, the crowd's all gone
Forlorn fiestas, but we carry on
Across the river, we still sway
Hoping some burial will, will stay
But it's all a masquerade
Dressed in promises we made
Full on fiestas where the colors fade
We dance in circles lost in the parade
Laughter's hollow, the crowd's all gone
Full on fiestas but we carry on
Full on fiestas where we fade away
Still we dance in our own decay
