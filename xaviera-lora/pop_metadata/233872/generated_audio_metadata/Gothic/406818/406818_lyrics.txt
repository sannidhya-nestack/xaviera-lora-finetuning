The government sucks
They're only in it for the bucks
If you're looking for a statesman
You're really out of luck
Everything sucks but me
Everything sucks but me
Big corporations blow, they're only in it for the dough
If you believe and trust'em, you're an idiot, you know
Everything sucks but me
Everything sucks but me
And you
You too
Not him
Everything sucks but me (hey hey hey)
Everything sucks but me
Everything sucks but me
Everything sucks but me
Not you
Not him
Yes, you, you too, not him

And maybe you
