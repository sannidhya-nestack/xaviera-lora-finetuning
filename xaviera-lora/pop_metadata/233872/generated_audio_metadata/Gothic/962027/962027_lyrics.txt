Now I've seen you looking for your heart and soul but you won't go
Cause you will never ever go what you do
For you to try and reach your goal is in your mind
You're looking for a bigger plan
The time it takes for you to smoke a cigarette, I'm high for you now
I'm ballin' down the seven stairs and in your mind
You're lookin' for a bigger planet, I understand that these could be a deadly hell
I believe in you, it's all in your head
The time it takes for you to surpass
The way you feel, I'm down in your soul
Tonight's the night that you reach your goal
And now I've seen you try and find your enemy to buy glass spends
You can't escape reality but why you do?
If understanding is up to you and on your mind
It's gotta be a dirty hunt
Yes I believe in you
It's all in your head
The time it takes for you to surpass
The way you feel from down in your soul
Tonight the night of you reach your goal
'Cause I believe in you, it's all in your head
The time it takes for you to surpass
The way you feel from down in your soul
Tonight's the night that you reach your goal
And I don't know which path I'm to choose
Between your eyes and I hope I lose
Inside my mind where I think I'm blind
But you, yourself, you're so harsh and kind
