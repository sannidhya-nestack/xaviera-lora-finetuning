Feel the weight run down your shoulder
Wake me up when it's all over
Just move quickly
Don't you make a sound
You know it kills me
How quickly
Take me down
We're falling through your hands
Take this dream and pour this back to you
One foot forward, one foot holy
Good for nothing's all you ever were
Leaning out your chest just like your poster of a sword
The secret's only in their eyes
Everyone is staring at you now
A long late flight till I get home again
Lean me back and rest my eyes until the world starts fading
Can't you block the sounds that scatter?
Heartbeat, it kills me
Hold me down, we'll fall into your hands
Take this dream and pull this back to you
One foot forward, one foot holding you
Good for nothing's all you ever knew
Leaning out your chest just like you're close to love or sworn
The secrets all lay in their eyes
Everyone is staring at you now
Does it bother you like it bothers me
How I'm left alone, way up to
Read between the lines
We know there's nothing left to find
We'll walk away
Does it bother you like it bothers me
How I'm left alone, way up to
Read between the lines
We know there's nothing left to find
We know there's
Does it bother you like it bothers me?
Does it bother you like it bothers me?
We walk away
Take this dream and pull this back to you
One foot forward, one foot holding you
Good for nothing's all you ever do
Bleeding out your chest
Take this dream and pull this back to you
One foot forward, one foot holding you
Good for nothing's all you ever do
Bleeding out your chest
It's like you're close to lovers
Sworn to secrets only in their eyes
Everyone is staring at you now
Everyone is staring at you now
Everyone is staring at you
