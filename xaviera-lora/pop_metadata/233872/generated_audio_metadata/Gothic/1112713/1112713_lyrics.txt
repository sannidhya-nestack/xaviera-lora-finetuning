Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Every time I think about you
That I must be around you
But you treat me like I don't belong
I guess I'll be way better off alone
How much I hate that you stole my heart
You tore it apart and acted like you don't mean anything to me
And if my heart was made of plastic you'd throw me into the fire
Into the fire
