Every listen to blow will be feeding on that talk
Deliciously glow will be gripping fever and more
The life of possession all over the grass
Proficating the soul in its very last gasp
A raging blitzkrieg in the time I found
Decades of debt, yen, dollars and pounds
In the arms of the next, a great open wide
An y of violence for the gift of midnight
For the gift of midnight
Through sweating, medically, it's glorious being
Protected by wealth, but not a crown of nothing
Excessive, profacious ambition, desire
All that's in part, all you think's a good start
Decadence and avarice, the subjects we found
The theatre of finance, the rabble in his hall
Familiarist craving, a habit of death
Gustav Hitler complex, the snake in the grass
Just a snake in the grass
Remember, racism blows, repeating on and on
Liquidly glowing, gripping evil and thought
Life in possession of love and pride
Suffocating the soul with this very heart and heart
A raging blitz, breaking the time I found
The caves of death, yen, dollars and pounds
In the heart of the nest, the grave will provide
And the Lord be a mine, as for the death come and thine
For the death come and thine
For the death come and thine
