You're a mess, you're sick, you better get some help
You're alone, your life is always somewhere else
No one knows the lies you tell yourself
They go on and they go on and they go on
You keep on singing that same old song
But you know you're wrong
Will you bend the brake to insanity?
Will you lose control or will you break free?
Of this road that's a one way street
It goes on and it goes on'til we all fall
You're a mess, you're sick, you'd better get some help
You're alone, your life is always somewhere else
No one knows the lies that tell yourself
They go on and they go on and they go on
They keep on saying you don't belong
But you know they're wrong
Is the world as cold as it really seems
Will you rise on up and will you break free
Of this road that's a one way street
It goes on and it goes on till we all fall
It goes on and it goes on till we all fall
It goes on and it goes on till we all fall
