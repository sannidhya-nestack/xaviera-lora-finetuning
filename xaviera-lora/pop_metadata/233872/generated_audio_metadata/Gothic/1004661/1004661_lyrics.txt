(laughing)
Do you ever wonder how the night feels going in?
Sudden rush, see the blood gush as the razor catches skin
I am here to share with you everything I know
On the run from the lament God in the fantasy horror show
You know it's not personal, don't be late for your funeral
Do you, do you, do you know what it's like?
To take a life, take a life
Do you ever think about murder in the first degree?
Killing a man with your bare hands in a scary jail killing spree?
Do you ever question the overwhelming urge to kill?
Fade to black, no turning back, a scream that's flat a thrill
Redditors and pedophiles, I'll kill'em all wearing just a smile
Do you, do you, do you know what it's like
To take a life?
Take a life
Take a life
Take a life
Take a life
Do you, do you, do you know what it's like
To take a life
Do you, do you, do you know what it's like
To take a life
Take a life
Take a life
Take a life
Take a life
(laughing)
