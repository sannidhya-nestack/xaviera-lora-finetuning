Cold whispers linger, filling empty space
I'm tracing shadows, memories I chase
In silence drifting, your voice feels near
Yet every heartbeat only echoes here
Wrapped in silence, trapped inside this room
Lost in circles, in endless gloom
I feel you breathing but you're nowhere close
Love's ghost haunting, the pain overdosed
Every sound's a faded trace
I'm drowning slowly in your grace
Echoes of you spinning me around
Your distant touch without a sound
Echoes of you locked inside my head
Holding on tight to words left unsaid
Frozen whispers tangled in my hair
Searching blindly knowing you're not there
Memories blurred and faded through
Nothing's clear now, just shades of you
In icy air, your name I breathe
Caught in dreams too numb to leave
My sense is numb, I'm pulled apart
The chill you left inside my heart
Echoes of you are gone to erase
Echoes of you, I still embrace
Echoes of you, spinning me around
You're distant, touch without a sound
Echoes of you, locked inside my head
Or holding on tight to words left unsaid?
Echoes of you forever here
In silent rooms your presence clear
Echoes of you still haunting me
Lost in the cold eternally
