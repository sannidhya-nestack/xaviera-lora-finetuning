She's got the big sledgehammer
Slung up way above the crowd
She's aiming for some fun so long
The volume stays this loud
Her hair is all twisted and rough cut
With a temple shaped clean ball
I know I've seen the gods before
But never been so more
She's a salty slammer and she's tearing up the town
Cracking her sledgehammer with her feet above the ground
She's awful mad, said a giant heart is who made her a devil
My spicy sweet sledgehammer gal is looking for real trouble
She's slammin' down the dreams
Just like her luscious lullabies
I can barely hear her voice
What with all these screams and cries
She's piercing through the barriers
But hold back love and hate
She's reached full hysteria
she'll no longer wait
Her full range of emotions
The stretch is clear to outer space
And when she skips her lotions
She's got such a pretty face
I follow her to heaven
When she strikes the final blow
And breathes contained duration
As the blood begins to flow
She was such a slammer and she's stirring up the town
Cracking her sledgehammer with her feet above the ground
She's off her meds and trying hard to simulate her devil
My spicy sweet sledgehammer gal is looking for real trouble
Tie that ripcord to my chest
Manage your spending list to trap a scary beast
Spin my heart, better die young
Nothing but the truth will do when wisdom comes to feast
I was here before the worst
I suppose two veins would bite me, accuracy
Let's be one in style, style
She will sell just hammer and she's stirring up the town
Cracking her sledgehammer with her feet above the ground
She's off her meds and trying hard to simulate her double
My spicy sweet sledgehammer gal is looking for real trouble
