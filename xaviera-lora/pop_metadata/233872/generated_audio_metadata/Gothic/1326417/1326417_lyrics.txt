Barbed wire sighs trace the curve of your grin
Heavy with tales that refuse to give in
I write your sigil on marrow-thin walls
Letters like daggers wear promise stars
Count the cracks, one, two, three, four
Every split worth healing for
Hold your breath, the silence ends
We break apart so it can mend
Say my name'til shadows ring
Blood to ink on fragile wing
Locked inside this endless spin
Last swing of begin, begin
We trade missteps like silver coins
Stitching new myths where the oldest joins
Sweetest lies fade when the sugar drains
Truth writes lines that remember stains
If doubt comes knocking, let it inside
Watch it shrink in the absence of pride
Kiss the wound where the promise grew
Some broken things still bloom true
Say my name'til shadows reign
Blood to ink on fragile wing
Locked inside this endless spin
Glass window, begin, begin
