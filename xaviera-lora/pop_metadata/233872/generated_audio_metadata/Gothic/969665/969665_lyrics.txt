This is life's a long clock
Each minute fading so fast
Battered, bruised and tortured
This day could be my last
I'm running on empty, running on empty, running on empty
No, get up and go, get up and go, get up and go
Time is running out, running out, running out
Still no, get up and go, get up and go, get up and go
Traces of my savior
My body aches beside me
This pain has crushed my soul
He will stare right through me
I'm running on empty, running on empty, running on empty
No, get up and go, get up and go, get up and go
Time is running out, running out, running out
Still I'll get up and go, get up and go, get up and go
Lying in position
My body laid to rest
Wrapped in eternal pleasure
That was my last request
I'm running on empty, running on empty, running on empty
No get up and go, get up and go, get up and go
Time is running out, running out, running out
Still no get up and go, get up and go, get up and go
Get up and go, get up and go, get up and go, get up and go, get up and go, get up and go, get up and go
