They busted through the Whole Foods wall
Groaning loud down every aisle
Not for brains they want them clean
No preservatives or margarine
One bitter guy then spat it out
"Is this brain GMO?" he'd shout
They want anic farmed ahead
And only if the host is dead
Zombies hate gluten, they read the label
No carbs, no wheat, no pulse heads cabled
They crave cow brains with a chia twist
Or almond skulls on a vegan list
They groan in rage at pizza crust
And only munch if it's locally trussed
They raid the pantry, sniffing jars
Rejecting snacks with factory scars
They moan for tofu, plant-based spleens
And oat milk thoughts with flaxseed dreams
I tried to run, but one did shout
You're full of cheese, we're throwing you out
They let me go with the final scoff
Try quinoa bro, you're throwing us off
Zombies hate gluten, they read the label
No carbs, no wheat, no processed cable
They crave cow brains with a cheer twist
Or almond skulls on a vegan list
They groan in rage at pizza crust
And only munch if it's locally trussed
Zombies hate gluten, won't touch my head
Unless I've fasted in full-fed dread
No fast food mines or soda sips
Just vintage brains with seaweed chips
Their moans are strict, their hunger green
The cleanest zombies you've ever seen
This Halloween, don't fear the dead
Fear the ones who reap the nutrition facts first
Zombies hate gluten, they count each bite
No gluten, sugar or appetite
If your soul ain't grass-fed too
They'll just groan and pass on you
They want their brains hard as an old maid
And compost coffins predicate
