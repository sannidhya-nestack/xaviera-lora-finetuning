Lost inside a crazy world, feeling like an animal
Anxious of a broken dream with nothing in between
Lost inside a crazy world, feeling like an animal
Anxious of a broken dream with nothing in between
Bleeding hearts, show me a sign and I'll try to keep my sane
Bleeding hearts, show me a sign and I'm finna stop the rain
Bleeding hearts, show me a sign and I'll finna keep my sane
Bleeding hearts, show me a sign and I'm finna stop the rain
Lost inside your crazy world, feeling like a freak on a leash
Ashes of a shattered mind
No one hears a silent scream
Soul becomes a handful of dust
It all comes down to this
Hope is dirty, now love rust
It all comes down to this
Bleeding hearts
Show me a sign and nothing to keep me sane
Show me the sign and I'm finna stop the rain
Bleeding hearts
Show me the sign and I'm finna keep me sane
Bleeding hearts
Show me the sign and I'm finna stop the rain
Bleeding hearts
