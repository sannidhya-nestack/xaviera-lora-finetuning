Come on, dance with me tonight
We'll take a stroll around the moon
Come on, dance with me tonight
We'll take a stroll around the moon
The spaceship's filled with gasoline
The acid's in the spoon
Come on, dance with me tonight
We'll take a stroll around the moon
The spaceship's filled with gasoline
The acid's in the spoon
Don't you worry little girl
You're safe here in my arms
Never mind the humanoids
They'll only do you harm
This will only hurt a bit
And the pain will turn to joy
Come on girl submit to me
I'll let you be my toy
Come on, dance with me tonight, we'll take a stroll around the moon
The spaceship's filled with gasoline, the acid's in the spoon
Come on, dance with me tonight, we'll take a stroll around the moon
The spaceship's filled with gasoline, the acid's in the spoon
Love, don't make me wait tonight
Don't let me waste my time
I'll go find another place
To make the perfect crime
Let's explore the universe
Inside my asteroid
The cockpit is a bullet's eye
The target is the sky
Come on, dance with me tonight, we'll take a stroll around the moon
The spaceship's filled with gasoline, the acid's in the spoon
Come on, dance with me tonight, we'll take a stroll around the moon
The spaceship's filled with gasoline, the acid's in the spoon
Come on, dance with me tonight
We'll take a stroll around the moon
The spaceship's filled with gasoline
The acid's in the spoon
