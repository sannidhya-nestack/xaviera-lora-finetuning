We walk the streets in midnight hues
A thousand whispers in every move
Stitch by stitch we carve our fate
In every seam we've found our state
No need to blend we stand apart
Worn like armour this is art
Fashion's not just what you wear
It's a symbol of truth laid bare
Threaded in darkness, we rise and shine
Wearing our thoughts one stitch at a time
Unspoken, we hold what's ours
Dressed in power beneath the stars
We are the vision, we are the dream
A revolution in every scene
Black lace wrapped around our skin
We make the rules, we let them spin
Not just a look, it's how we feel
Every thread holds something real
No need to blend, we stand apart
Worn like armor, this is art
Fashion's not just what you wear
It's a symbol of truth laid bare
Threaded in darkness, we rise and shine
Wearing our thoughts one stitch at a time
Unspoken, we own what's ours
Dressed in power beneath the stars
We are the vision, we are the dream
A revolution in every scene
Not just a trend, we break the mold
A world reborn in threats so bold
In every fold, our story's told
We wear our soul, we wear our gold
Threaded in darkness, we rise and shine
Wearing our thoughts one stitch at a time
Unspoken, we own what's ours
Dressed in power beneath the stars
We are the vision, we are the dream
A revolution in every scene
Threaded in darkness, we wear our name in every stitch
We light the flame
