It starts with words and escalates to tears
How did I get here?
The room spins and my vision blurs
I can't make out your words
I look at you to analyze
I see no remorse in your eyes
And now you've taken my breath
It's the best day of my death
A brand new start, my old life's dead and gone
I've never felt so strong
My heart won't beat, I can't recall why I have
No pulse at all
And now you take in my breath
It's the first day of my death
I feel your veins on my neck
It's the best day of my death
And we'll bathe in blood
At last I am loved
And now you've taken my breath
It's the best day of my death
I feel your fangs on my neck
It's the best day of my
Death
