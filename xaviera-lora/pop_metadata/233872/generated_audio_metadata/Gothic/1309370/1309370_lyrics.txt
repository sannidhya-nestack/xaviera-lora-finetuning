Some desire now has come
The girl with the black eyes
Kisses me as if we've just run from the other side
And through the day that soon will come
I will hold her tightly
Oh and when tomorrow comes
We'll meet again tonightly
Black eye
I see you in my deepest dreams
Black eye
I would kiss your photograph
Love to make your acquaintance
All day I sense you lingering
A phantom in the light
Your echo in the silence sings
And draws me back each night
Evening drapes the sky so slowly
Your memory draws me near
I crave your touch my heart so lonely
Waiting for you to reappear
Black eyes, I see you in my deepest dreams
Black eyes, I would kiss your photograph
Love to make your acquaintance
Love to make
If dawn should hide your tender face
And shadows turn to day
I'll close my eyes to find that place
Where your black eyes guide the way
Black eyes
I see you in my deepest dreams
Black eyes
I would kiss your photograph
Love you made your acquaintance
Dawn should hide your tender face
And shadows turn to day
I'll close my eyes to find that place
Where your black eyes guide the way
I see you in my deepest dreams, black eyes
I would kiss your photographs
Love to make your acquaintance
