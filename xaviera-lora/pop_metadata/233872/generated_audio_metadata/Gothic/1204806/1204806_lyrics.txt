She's got these beautiful black eyes
It turns me on
She pulls the strings in my left
I'm finally spun
She's got these beautiful eyes
It turns me on
She pours her streams in my land
I'll finally smile
She finally holds all of the cards
She's king and queen
She has insatiable desire
She is all that I need
Daddy and my son
And this is all in the past now
Her day is one
The end is now to et now
Daddy and my son
And this is all in the past now
Her day is one
The end is now to et now
She's got this beautiful black eye that turns me on
She pulls the strings in my life I'll finally smile
She finally holds all of the cards
She's thin and green
She has insatiable desire
She is all that I need
Butting at my son
And this is all in the past now
Her day is one
The end is now to et now
Butting at my son
And this is all in the past now
Her day is one
The end is now to et now
Butting at my son
And this is all in the past now, her day is won
You need to stop to et now, let him get my son
And this is all in the past now, her day is won
You need to stop to et now, let him get my son
And this is all in the past now
Her day is won
It is time to et now
