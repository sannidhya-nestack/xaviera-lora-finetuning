Haley catch me now I'm breaking off
I lost my medicine I'm nearly stoned
A broken volunteer I slowly slipped away
Went to something scary or slightly ordinary
One chance to light the flames that still surround us
Within our eyes broken down to size
We bring this all upon us
We will tear this open from the inside
et these problems and try to get some sleep
You loosen up and lie there, and spread yourself so thin
And pull this back and reach inside and try to fake a smile
And on this January night
Turn out your lies
So can you take us back to where we used to be
It's overcompensated but never ordinary
Late to bed, just sleep all day
Wake up laughing, still alone
Wrap yourself in cellophane
Fashion show becomes your own
One is ten, you work at night
One is ten, you work at night
So Haley catch me now I'm breaking off
I lost my medicine I'm nearly stoned
A broken balance here I slowly slip away
