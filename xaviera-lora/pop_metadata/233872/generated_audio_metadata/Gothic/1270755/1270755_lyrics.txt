In the midst of witching hour
West winds ride a soaring breeze
Conjuring the ancient color
We partake in the mysteries
Eternal echoes in the dark
Hearts so light we leave our mark
Spirits dance beneath the moon
Captured in all in one or two
In the midst of witching hour
Whispers ride the song and breeze
Conquering the ancient power
We partake in the mysteries
Eternal echoes in the dark
Hearts on earth
We leave our mark
Oh
Spirits dance beneath the moon
Captured in our immortal tomb
Ooh
Through the mist of memories we chase
Silent vows we left without a trace
Desires kept us in their fold
Chasing dreams that feel so visceral
Eternal echoes in the dark
Hearts sunburned, we leave our mark
Oh, spirits dance beneath the moon
Captured in our world of doom
Thunder storms like fading hues
Memories ignite the flame
Through the veil I'll reach for you
Calling out your secret name
Eternal echoes in the dark
Hearts sundered we leave our mark
Oh, spirits dance beneath the moon
Captured in our immortal tomb
Ooh, as the dawn begins to break
Whispers fade but love stays awake, ooh
In our dreams we'll reunite
Dancing through endless night, ooh
