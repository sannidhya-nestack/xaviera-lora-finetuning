She walks in silence through the halls of time
A porcelain face with sense sublime
Scarlet stains her legacy
Drenched in dreams of two and me
Eyes like mirrors reflecting pain
Countess, countess in the lane
She's facing beauty's ghostly fall
Cog in the echo of it all
Lost in her reflection
Where innocence was torn
A labyrinth of obsession
A crown of dawn
Oh Bathory, can't you see?
You wear your mask like royalty
Bathory, I don't sleep
Drowning in insanity
Bathory, you catch me because I love you
She wants her cup with trembling hands
Crimson promises, dark demands
She seeks redemption in glass
But finds herself a shattered past
Whispers of youth she can't reclaim
Fading echoes in her name
She chases shadows in her ball
Haunted by the silent call
Lost in her reflection
Where innocence was torn
A labyrinth of obsession
Crown and a thorn
Oh, Bathory, can't you see?
You and your words, my loyalty
Bathory, asleep, drowning in insanity
Bathory, you can't sleep, a prison of humanity
In the tower of her shame, she's a prisoner to her name
No salvation from the pain, only madness in her reign
Lies and legends intertwine, where the truth begins to die
Countess of the darkest cry, love is further to her cry
Oh Bathory, can't you see?
You wear your words like royalty
Valkyrie, endlessly, drowning in eternity
Valkyrie, you can't breathe, the prison of humanity
Her face in every mirror fades, an empire lost in masquerades
Houses of a broken dream, forever trapped in her regime
Oh Valkyrie, can't you see, you wear your wounds like royalty
