It's a hundred ounce party
So bring everybody
Invite your undead misters and your witchy witchy sister
Cartagouas with a bong and it smokes all night long
We freaks are down to rave
From far beyond the grave
Bones down in the basement
Break dancing to the bass hits
Werewolf conga line
Wagging tails behind
The vampires on the walls
Scoping out the voodoo dolls
It's a haunted house party (party, party, party)
A funky zombie party (party, party, party)
Undead pirate drinking rum
And we party all night long
The mummies got real loose
They chugged the jungle juice
Got a giant spider DJ
Scratching with all eight legs
Skeletons xylophones
Playing all night long
It's our house party
A funky zombie party
Undead pirate drinking rum
And we party all night long
Let me hear those xylophones
It's a haunted house party (party, party, party)
A funky zombie party (party, party, party)
Undead pirate drinking rum
And we party all night long
