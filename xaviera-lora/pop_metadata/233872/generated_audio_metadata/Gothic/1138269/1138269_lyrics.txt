We universe
Here our story
In the world
Of attentionless
Screams of pain
Dreams through space
Carrying upon the solar wings
Madness, our creative side
Us doing our own
We call the cops in our own image
So let's reach above every crystal
We are the dark big things
In our fantasy games
We sleep on the terror thing
One, two, three
Our race through the ages has suffered for the cause
Endless blood of our broken dreads
Fall into the ocean
Repel the storm
The spines of the odds
We bear the scars
This was our fate
We've had our scars all pay off
It's time to undock our dress
We've had our scars all pay off
I'm a dirty butcher but you can
And now we walk with our breath of insanity
With our universe to command
Worship us for our blood
We'll never turn
We'll never turn to shame
Always believe this
The suffering for the good
In the blood of our own children
Born into reality
You're a fucking start
The source of the odds
We bear the scars
The scars of millions
We bear the scars of millions
Extinct to our godlike dreams
We bear the scars of millions
Our minds are able to function
Yeah
Blood, faith, our immortal core
Pray you never hear our coming
Then fuck four more, but some still run
Strife of endless pain
Tripped through empty space
Crafting upon
Tearing upon
The solar wave
I'll drink deep
Your blood
Consumes everything
Control your race
I'll take forward your world
I'll drink the young blood
God still rules in flesh
