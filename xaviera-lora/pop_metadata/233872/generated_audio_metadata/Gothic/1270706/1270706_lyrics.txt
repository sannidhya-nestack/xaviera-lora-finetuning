In the silence where echoes roam
Under skies that have been unknown
We wander paths of endless grey
Chasing dreams that fade away
Take my hand before we pause
Feel the rhythm of the dark
Lost in time we can't deny
Feel the sunlight suck the sky
Faces fade like distant stars
Stories etched with hidden scars
Through the haze your eyes meet mine
A fleeting touch in borrowed time
The constellations got away
Holding on to yesterday
One last dance before the end
Echoes linger my dear friend
Take my hand before we part
Feel the rhythm of the dark
Lost in time we can't deny
Till the sun lights up the sky
