All my life for this
Give me something I can't lose in this
I'ma make a flip and hold in this
Gotta break it down, break it down, kick it'til it falls
Why can't I fit?
Why can't I fit?
I see you standing there, breathing in my fear (my fear)
I wish you'd hear my prayer, unlock my heaven's fear (my fear)
I know you could dance in there, get it out of my way, get it out of my way (my fear)
I know you could dance in there, get it out of my way, get it out of my way
I've been waiting all my life for this
Give me something I can't lose and miss
I'm a make it flip and roll and miss
Gotta break it down, break it down, kick it'til it falls
I've been waiting all my life for this
Give me something I can lose and miss
I'ma make a flip in holiness
Gotta break it down, break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it, break it, break it, break it
I've been waiting all my life for this
Give me something I can lose and miss
I'm on my car, flipping all in this
Gotta break it down, break it down
Kick it'til it falls
My shit, my shit, my shit, my shit, my shit
I've been waiting all my life for this
Give me something I can lose and miss
I'm a mother flipping holiness
Gotta break it down, break it down, kick it to the floor
