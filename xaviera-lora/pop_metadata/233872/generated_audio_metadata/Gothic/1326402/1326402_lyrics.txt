Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Dressed in layers we take the stage
A silent protest, a stylish rage
Sculpted in leather, stitched with grace
Walking the edge of a different space
We wear our truth with required pride
In the spaces where rebels hide
Every stitch, every seam
A manifestation of the dream
Culture in the dark, we own the show
A touch of madness, we'll let it grow
Laced in mystery, dressed to kill
We rise from the silence, bent to will
We are the fashion, we are the flame
We're in a fashion, we are the flame
We're in a fashion, we are the flame
We're in a fashion, we are the flame
The world can judge but we'll stand tall
A siren languish we break the wall
Eyes that pierce with a knowing grace
We leave a charge in the hollow space
We wear our truth with quiet pride
In the spaces where rebels hide
Every stitch, every seed
A manifestation of the tree
Culture in the dark
We only show a touch of madness
We let it pour, laced in mystery
Dressed to kill, we rise from the silence
Bent to will
We are the passion, we are the flame
We're our passion, you claim our name
We're our passion, you claim our name
We're our passion, you claim our name
On the edge of chaos, we dance, we run
The keys on the style of a world we've won
In the silence, we speak so loud
We're the outcasts and we're the proud
Couture on the top, we ain't a show
A touch of madness, we let it grow
Laced in mystery, dressed to kill
We rise from the silence, dance in will
We are the fashion, we are the flame
With our passion, we claim our fame
Would our passion reclaim our name?
Would our passion reclaim our name?
Pretend it's all a claim I made
We rise, we rise, we're never the same
