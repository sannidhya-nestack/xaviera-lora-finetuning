The mirror shows a stranger's face, lines carved deep, no saving grace
Memories fade like dust and air, with every breath I'm more aware
Of all the years that slipped away, chasing dreams I couldn't stay
I feel the weight of every day, creeping in like silver cake
Which stayed intact, slipping through the cracks of life
Holding on to what's behind, while the world moves out of sight
We're just fading time, no one here can stop the fall
But I won't let it blow up the fire, even as the years grow tall
The mirror shows a stranger's face, lines carved in no saving grace
Memories fade like dust and air, with every breath I'm more aware
Of all the years that slipped away, chasing dreams I couldn't stay
I feel the weight of every day, creeping in like soul decay
We're just fading in time, slipping through the cracks of life
Holding on to what's behind, while the world moves out of sight
We're just fading in time
No one here can stop the fall
But I won't let go of the fire
Even as the years grow tall
In this body trapped inside
It's a cage that won't confide
The soul remains but the skin is torn
Echoes of the days we've worn
The hands of clocks they cut like knives
Marking off the stolen lives
But deep within I still can fight
Burning through this endless night
We're just fading types
Slipping through the cracks of life
Holding on to what's behind
While the world moves out of sight
We're just fading in time, no one here can stop the fall
But I won't let go of the fire
Even as the years grow tall
I walk with every scar I've earned and every tear
The lessons learned, though the end is drawing near
I won't surrender to the fear
We've just stayed in time, slipping through the cracks of life
Holding on to what's behind while the world moves out of sight
We're just fading time
No one here can stop the fall
But I won't let go of the fire
Even as the years grow tall
