I wake you up to suggest you can tie me up if you want to
Don't stop until you're satisfied
I don't think you know how much I want you
Blindfolded even though it's dark
But I want to feel tingle in each joint
The tie that binds in ecstasy
A voice you give to your rapture point
This is crazy love
Hurt me if you want to
this is crazy love
It only hurts if it's not true
Late at night I'm watching you breathing so gently asleep
I hope it's me you're dreaming of
something's going on under the sheets
This is crazy love
Hurt me if you want to
this is crazy love
It only hurts if it's not true
This is crazy love, uh!
No need for safety words
this is crazy love
When it's true it never hurts
This is crazy love
Hurt me if you want to
This is crazy love
It only hurts if it's not true
This is crazy love
This is crazy love
This is crazy love
It only hurts if it's not true
