But he said he should as well
I'm old to burn
Don't you see?
My father's been the fucking head
Cut my skin
Sing my name
Don't be so hard
I've been getting
Don't you try
Manicure
Go down to hell, you'll be your friend
Hold your head, watch yourself, watch for death
And realize you're fucking grown
Heaven rise your crown
Burn this city to the ground
Heaven rise your fucking crown
Heaven rise your crown
Burn this city to the ground
Heaven rise your fucking crown
I see your body on the floor
The light went straight through your heart
We'll raise our glass up in the air
And spread our message to the world
They say you're here, but I'm still here
Sorry love, you're so out of
Brain's in the gut, but I'm still here
Sorry love, you're so out of
Hold your breath, don't you dare
Wait for this pain, you're fucking it
Hold your tongue, watch it burn
Open your eyes, you're fucking blind
Heaven lies your grave (I'm listening to the grave)
Heaven lies your fucking grave
Heaven lies your grave (I'm listening to the grave)
Heaven lies your fucking grave
We take a year, but somehow, some will help, some will help
We take a year, but somehow, some will help, some will help
