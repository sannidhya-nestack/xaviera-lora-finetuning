Street lights flicker in the open night
Sirens echo, dancing with the fight
I chase illusions down the vacant lane
Searching for contact in swirling rain
Sirens surge, ripping through my mind
No more secrets left to find
All I hear is your design
Siren search can't be denied
The flickers on the screen beckon me on
Traces of your voice nearly gone
I won't surrender to the vacant tune
Drums of rebellion call me soon
Silent search ripping through my mind
No more secrets left to find
All I hear is your design
Silent search can't be denied
In this twisted corridor, I'm not alone
Your call resonates deep in my bones
We revolve like satellites in silent bloom
Clinging to sparks beneath the dune
Siren surge, I can't refuse
Siren surge, I still choose
Siren surge roars in every sound
Guiding me where I'm truly bound
When the morning breaks anew
That echo remains leading me to you
