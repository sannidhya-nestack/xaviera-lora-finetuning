Everything you imagine would heaven will be
It's a small glimpse of what I, I'd like to see, yeah
Follow me, I call you
Follow me, peace awaits
Follow me, I'm creator
Follow me to live
All the fears and the lies, lay them aside
Deny your life, lay it down
We will see who'll be left behind, yeah
Follow me, I call you
Follow me, peace awaits
Follow me, I'm creator
Follow me to live
There's nothing new under the sun
There's nothing new under the sun
There's nothing new under the sun
There's nothing new under the sun
There's nothing new under the sun
There's nothing new under the sun
There's nothing new under the sun
There's nothing new under the sun
There's nothing new under the sun
There's nothing new under the sun
Yeah, follow me, I call you
Follow me, peace awaits
Follow me, I'm creator
Follow me to live
Follow me, I call you
Follow me, peace awaits
Follow me, I'm creator
Follow me to live
