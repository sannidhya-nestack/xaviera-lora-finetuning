Time waits for no one
The only constant is change
Learn as you grow
And live what you know
Clocks tick by so fast
Foxy people die
Clock is shown by the sun
Tells you what must be done
Takes all you have to give
Does not et
Does not ive
Lessons of life take a lifetime to learn
A time to laugh, a time to sigh
A time to seek the truth, it's time to seek some proof
A time to stand up and then ask why
Why are we here, in this place?
Doing these things, we're told to do
Why don't we wake up from a dream?
Can't we do this our own?
Why are we here?
In this place
Why don't we wake
Up from the drum
Lessons of life
Take a lifetime to learn
You're the only one
I am the clock, I control your mind
I will decide how long you live and when you'll die
I am the clock, I have the final say
I am the clock, I put you in your grave
I am the clock, I control your time
I am the clock, you can run but you can't hide
Why's it go so fast?
Clocks see people die
Clocks are shown by the sun
Tells you what must be done
Takes all you have to give
Does not et
Does not ive
Tying weights for no one
The only constant is change
Learn as you grow
And live what you know
Clocks tick by so fast
Locks the evil die
Clock is shown by the sun
Tells him what must be done
Takes all you have to give
Does not et
Does not ive
The sins of life take a lifetime to learn
Toxic bites so fast, floxy people die
Foxes shown by the sun tells you what must be done
Takes all you have to give
Does not et, does not ive
I am the clock, I have control your mind
I will decide how long you'll live and when you'll die
I am the clock, I have the final say
I am the clock, I'll put you in your grave
I am the clock, I have control your time
I am the clock, you can run but you can't hide
