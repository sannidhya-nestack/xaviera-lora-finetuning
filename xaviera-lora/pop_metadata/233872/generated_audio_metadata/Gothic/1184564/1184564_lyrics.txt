I travel the world to extend and look down upon it from space
I have covered the edge of its lens
But I can't find rest in one single place
Oh, now please tell me
What more can this world be?
Oh, please tell me
Is there more to see?
I have crawled through the maze of pain
Dead on my feet
All games hopeless
I know all the features my way
But committed every sin there is
Oh, please tell me, what more can this world offer me?
Oh, please tell me, is there more to see?
All I have become, all I care
Long time ago
Death came to me
Said come with me now
Only the dead now
Choose wisely, set yourself free
Choose wisely, set yourself free
Choose wisely, set yourself free
Choose wise (Eli, Eli, Eli, Eli)
Choose wise (Eli)
Choose wise (Eli)
Choose wise (Eli, Eli, Eli, Eli)
Choose wise (Eli)
Choose wise (Eli)
Choose wise (Eli, Eli, Eli, Eli)
Choose wise (Eli)
Choose wise (Eli)
Choose wise (Eli)
Left right
Cross A
Keep the smash
But I took my pleasures away
And I tried to end it myself
In every post
All over my face
Oh no please help me
Why did I choose life when you came to me
Oh death please take me
Come and set me free
Come and set me free
Come and set me free
Set me free
Come and set me free
