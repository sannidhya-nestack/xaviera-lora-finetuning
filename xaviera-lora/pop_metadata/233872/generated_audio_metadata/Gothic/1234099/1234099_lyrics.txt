Didn't mean to lose my mind
I didn't mean to sacrifice my life to fall in love
Didn't mean to lose my mind
This is what you came for, good times
This is what you came for, good times
This is what you came for
(audience laughing)
Didn't mean to light the fire
Didn't mean to burn the wood
Didn't mean, didn't mean, didn't mean to lose the light
Didn't mean to lose the light
Didn't mean to light the fire
Didn't mean to go away
Didn't mean to leave
Didn't mean to lose the light
(I'm back)
(I'm back)
Give me to identify
Give me to save me
Do you mean me?
Give me to freeze me
Give me to identify
Give me to save me
Do you mean me?
Give me to freeze me
You're the angel, I the fire, the light, the sun, the moon, the rain, the wind, the angels, the night
You didn't mean to, I could find it
Oh, you didn't mean, didn't mean, didn't mean to hurt me
You didn't mean to, I could find it
Oh, you didn't mean, didn't mean, didn't mean to hurt me
