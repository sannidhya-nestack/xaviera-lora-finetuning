She speaks in layers, she walks on feathers, she cries with laughter, she whispers next to me, I'm cracking queer whispering secrets to me
Get out of my head
I'm behaving quite oddly
Better think before you walk
I'm failing
I'm all alone
I'm seething
Don't push me
Quit whispering secrets to me
Get out of my head
And I'm behaving quite oddly
Better thank thee for you all
She moves in tremors
She chills with whispers
She blushes with terror
Quit creeping on me, I'm sweating
Quit whispering secrets to me
Get out of my head
I'm behaving quite oddly
Let's eat some crazy pills and break free
Better think before you walk
Or before you know you're in the troubles of man
It's why the ocean's full with the same old scams
Wash away the guilt, it's all part of the plan
She speaks in layers
She walks on feathers
She cries with laughter
She whispers next to me
I'm cracking
Quit whispering secrets to me
Get out of my head
I'm behaving quite oddly
Better think before you walk
I'm failing
I'm all alone
I'm seething
Don't push me
Quit whispering secrets to me
Get out of my head
I'm behaving quite oddly
Better think before you walk
She moves in tremors
She chills with whispers
She blinds with terror
Quit creeping on me, I'm sweating
Quit whispering secrets to me
Get out of my head
And I'm behaving quite oddly
Better think before you walk
Quit whispering secrets to me
Get out of my head
And I'm behaving quite oddly
Let's eat some crazy pills and break free
Better think before you walk
Or before you know you're in the troubles of man
That's why the ocean's full with the same old scams
Wash away the guilt it's all part of the plan
Watch the world collide and the hatred rise
We're always in and out of our own damn minds
A fabric stamp, rip a hole through time
There's no stopping us now, yes the end is nigh
