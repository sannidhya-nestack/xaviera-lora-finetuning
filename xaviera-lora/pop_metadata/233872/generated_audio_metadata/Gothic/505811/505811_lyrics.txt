When you said everything was such a mess
Lost yourself in your own design
Every thought immersed in pain
Trapped into these thoughts of mankind
You were self absorbed
Always running always on the take
I was blinded crazy
I was blinded crazy
All deposit
No return
But if we could change the world
We'll just one song and give this all to you
And if we could change the world
We'll just one song and give this all to ya
I felt so far along that lonely path
Long regrets of your design
Cutting ties and running blind
Desperate nights that long for more time
Now I've lost control
Always far but never far away
This new I can better
The truth is all in bitter
All emotion
No control
But if we could change the world
With just one song I'd give this all to you
And if we could change the world
With just one song I'd give this all to ya
Grab me up, knock me down, push me out
Explanations grow tired and old
All emotion, no control
But if we could change the world
With just one song that gives this all to you
And if we could
Change the world
With just one song that gives this all to you
