Ex-lovers and lawyers, sons and their daughters
And people that I used to know
Cooking programme repeats on flat screen TV
Staying home for the start of the show
People click mouses and stock up their houses
While corner shops board up and close
Why venture outside in the cold morning light
When you've all that you need in your home
Mobile computers, she's fighting with wax machines
Which one to be put on hold
Now it's November, nobody remembers
They sit and complain about the cold
He tells me all he knows of TV talent shows
Foreign affairs and football scores
Tabloids and politics, I start to feel sick
And I head for the nearest door
This is nothing like the brochure said it would be
And in my heart I know that most of this world I will never see
While my mind wanders I look to a girl
Clued to a telephone shoulder length girl
Surrounded by people I wonder if she ever seen the sky
Does she feel alive?
Walking through streets over gold frozen leaves
In the darkness I can't see what lies
Smile from a stranger alarm bells of danger
And inside a part of me dies
In a suit he buys wine for anyone but his wife
Who thinks that he's out working late
Barmaids and drinkers, liars and thinkers
All captains, none among them may
This is nothing like the brochures said it would be
In my heart I know that most of this world I will never see
While my mind wanders I look to a girl
Glued to her telephone shoulder length girl
Surrounded by people
I wonder if she ever seen the sky
Does she feel alive
I know this is not what I planned
But I will do all that I can
I know this is not what I planned
But I will do all that I can
I know this is not what I planned
But I will do all that I can
I know this is not what I planned
But I will do all that I can
I know this is not what I planned
But I will do all that I can
I know this is not what I planned
But I will do all that I can
