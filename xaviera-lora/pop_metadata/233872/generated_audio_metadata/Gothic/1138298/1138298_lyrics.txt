Round like a crowd of wolves
But it's the dead now traveling me
No sound but the scream of the woods
They're terrified and it's no dream
They don't care if you rise or fall
it's all the fucking same these days
And I swear if we don't hear anymore
We'll die with a smile on our face
I wipe the smile from your face
With a smile on my face
I wipe the smile from your face
Shake those dreams of fame
Do a little dance for you
Don't take advice from the lame
Don't chew your marks'til you get two
I don't care what they think of you
Or how you think your life would have changed
And I swear when you think things through
It's best if you buy a wrench
I wipe the smiles off your face
I wipe the smiles off my face
I wipe the smiles off your face
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Round like a crown of thorns
What is it now is strangling me
No sound but the scream of the lords
They're terrified that it's no dream
They don't care if you ride or fall
Well since all the books say these days
And I swear it we don't hear anymore
Die with a smile on our face
Oh I can smile from your face
I wear the smile on my face
I wipe that smile from your face
