Feel your whispers slip beneath my skin
Cold illusion, the secrets creeping in
I'm falling deeper into your disguise
Caught forever in your obsidian eyes
Midnight currents carry me away
Secrets breathing nothing left to say
Your silent promises ring unclear
Yet somehow I keep drawing near
Twisting truths, illusion sky
Wrapped in darkness, come undone
Obsidian eyes, you pull me under
Dark reflections lost inside your lies
Frozen whisper, endless lies
I'm hypnotized by obsidian eyes
Echoes fading, thoughts begin to blur
Bound to silence, senses start to stir
Aching memories entangled by design
Cold embraces blurring every line
Chains unspoken bind me here again
Caught between desire and the pain
Fading whispers, endless love lies
Forever trapped by your obsidian eyes
Obsidian eyes, I'm sinking slow
Lost inside the darkness you bestow
Trapped inside your obsidian eyes
Promises burning, can't recognize
Pull me deeper, truth becomes lies
Lost forever in obsidian eyes
Obsidian eyes, I can't escape your gaze
Bound within your cold and endless maze
Falling deeper, no more alibis
Among forever your obsidian eyes
