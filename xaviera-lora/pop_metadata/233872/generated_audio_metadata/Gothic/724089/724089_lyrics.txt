It borrows still at the size of messed up lines
They fail to cover up these lies
They infiltrate the turning point
It's all the same, it's such a shame
There's a sinner in every soul
In a poor world
You mistakenly chose wrong and I grow tired of these tales
Because everyone knows how it feels
To disappoint the ones you love and be fine with that
Sticks and stones don't mean a thing to the best of us
As long as we et about this
So take a shot now
The chamber's stuck, don't just smell up
Don't miss out on the killing blow
Things like these just go to show
There's a sinner in every song
This time it's me and I believe in hope
If you say so
But only because the chamber's stuck, let it go
And I know how it feels to disappoint the ones you love and be fine with it
Sticks and stones don't mean a thing to the best of us
As long as we et about the summer air
The fuck you stare, the "I don't care"
That's inside in this state, I believe in honor
To make it all go away, I say
I'd say, I always seem to disappoint the ones I love and be fine with that
Their wrong choice to disappoint the ones you love and be fine with that
Sticks and stones don't mean a thing to the best of us
As long as we et about this
