In the fading glow of morning
I walk paths I've never known
Echoes of a distant calling
Urging me to claim my own
Time will wait for my surrender
Every moment slips away
Feel the pulse, the smouldering ember
Live the life I own today
Is a change are all around me
Echoes lost upon the air
Now's the time to break the boundaries
Cast aside all doubt and fear
Time won't wait for my surrender
Every moment slips away
Feel the pulse, the smoldering ember
With the life I own today
Days of change are all around me
Echoes lost upon the air
Now is the time to break the boundaries
Cast aside all doubt and fear
Time will wait for my surrender
Every moment slips away
Feel the pulse, the smoldering amber
Live the life I own today
Standing on the edge of reason
Looking back on what has been
Embrace the chaos of the season
Let the journey now begin
Time will wait for my surrender
Every moment slips away
Feel the pulse, the soul to remember
Live the life I own today
