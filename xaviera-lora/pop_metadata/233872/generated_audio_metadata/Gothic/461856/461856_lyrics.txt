In a fishbowl, in the corner of my eye
I see myself, with a sacrifice
Look in my face, see you spin around
Why did you come here, and take my sound?
Why don't I see old Jesus in your living room
Watch him run and die
Why can't I cry in the middle of the night
Sitting here alone, rubbing my eyes
I see myself in a fishbowl
Going crazy, we're going home
See no Jesus in your living room
I watch him burn and die
In the back of my mind
I see that door
I bleed my life
Three feet tall
You come to my place
You break down my door
Nothing much
But a little fucking whore
See your Jesus in your living room
Watch him burn and die
I see your Jesus in your living room
Watching a man and I
I wish I could read
The amount of my life
Go somewhere and don't have to fight
I see your colors, every kind
I see myself getting real high
And you're living them
Watch him run and die
I see your Jesus in your living room
Watch him run and die
