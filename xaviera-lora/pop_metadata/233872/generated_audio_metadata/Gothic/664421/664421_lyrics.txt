No light, vague lines
Dark night, just the moon and me
Blinding, roads unwinding
As my heart beats down on me
Tired eyes
Old bones realize they're all alone
Cause I've been here in my sleep
Far too far back into the deep
Can you hear me now cause I can't hear a sound
Can I lose
Just this once
Would it be so bad
Would it be so bad
If you let me in
If you let me in
Can you hear me now
Cause I can't hear a sound
Can I lose
Just this once
Would I be so glad
Would I be so glad
If you let me in
If you let me in
