It's a hunger you have to feed
But it has another name
Hypocrisy
Where the ends become the means all along
You keep moving along
You keep going along
You keep having the hope
That everything will get better
You keep moving along
You keep going along
You keep having the hope
That everything will get better
But you know you're wrong
You keep moving along
You keep going along
You keep having the hope
That everything will get better
You keep moving along
You keep going along
You keep having the hope
That everything will get better
But you know you're wrong
