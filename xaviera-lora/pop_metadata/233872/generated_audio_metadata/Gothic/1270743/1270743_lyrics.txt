Shadows flicker on the empty streets
Neon lights where our fates will meet
Echoes linger from a distant time
Lost in pages of a war now
We're falling, falling into the light
Chasing dreams that fade with the light
In the silence we hear the call
We're dancing on the edge of it all
Whispers drift across the empty streets
Neon lights where our fates will meet
Echoes linger from a distant time
Lost in pages of a worn out rhyme
We're falling, falling into the night
Chasing dreams that fade with the light
In the silence we hear the call
We're dancing on the edge of it all
Whispers drift across the hollow ground
Silent voices that can't be found
Broken mirrors reflect our eyes
Searching for truth beneath the lies
We're falling, falling into the night
Chasing dreams that fade with the light
In the silence we hear the call
We're dancing on the edge of it all
Tugs and still in this endless haze
Wandering through life's twisted maze
If we reach out will we be saved
Or vanish into the past
We're falling, falling into the night
Chasing dreams that fade with the light
In the silence, we hear the call
We're dancing on the edge of it all
We're dancing on the edge of it all
