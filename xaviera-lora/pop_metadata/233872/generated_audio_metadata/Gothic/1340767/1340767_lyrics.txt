Courted by the curious
Ported through the ages
Shorted by the ledger
But sorted in the pages
Shorted by design
Sorted through the chaos
Kept the signal
Across the line
Spiraling
Down and out
Am I not dreaming?
Extorted by the vision of seeing you again
They sported their theories with impeccable poise
But my truths once thwarted now dismantle their noise
Ideas they once aborted in the margins of their creed
Became the seeds I transported
To the gardens they now read
Spiraling
Down and out
Am I not dreaming?
Started by the vision of seeing you again
The past was recorded
With selective precision
Yet supported in my quiet
In the architect's vision
Each notion transported
Through the corridors of thought
Where the value lies not
In what's sold but in what's sold
I'm spiraling down and out
Am I not dreaming?
Extorted by the vision of seeing you again
Courted by the ages yet never owned or hoarded
Ideas once aborted now universally supported
The arc of the voyage with each concept transported
Is a testament to the mind that cannot be deported
Deported but the exile was the teacher for the journey is the thesis and the distance the feature every truth
I've imported every dream I've exported is a life reassembled and perfectly assorted
Spirally
Down and out
Am I not true?
Exploded by the vision of seeing you again
Spiraling down and out
Spiraling down and out
Am I not dreaming?
