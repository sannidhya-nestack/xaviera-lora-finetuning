Feeling the rhythm, lights dim, candlelight glow
Captivated by the vibe, watching the world flow
Cozy in the corner while the vinyl's been slow
Every note soothes the soul like a predicted show
Innocent, peaceful, did the chill beats whisper
Hold it on to the moment, a melodic mister
Let the night drift on
Let the music play
Wrap in this groove
Will quietly sway
In the candid light
Of the soft moon ray
Where the world pauses
In the lounge we stay
Silent connections while our thoughts sink
Words unspoken but the hearts never shrink
Sip of the wine, a melody in each chink
We'll lose ourselves in the dream we seek
Instrumental waves, guide us on our way
Tonight's a canvas as we choose to display
Let the night drift on, let the music play
Wrap in this groove
Will quietly sway
In the candid light
Of the soft moon ray
Where the world
All sits in the lounge we stay
Each note's a journey, a moment to hold
Stories unfold in harmonies told
In this cocoon our spirits console
Lost in the rhythm, warmth of the soul
Let the night drift on, let the music play
Wrapped in this groove
Will quietly sway
In the candlelight
Of the sulfur rain
Where the world
All sits in the lounge we stay
