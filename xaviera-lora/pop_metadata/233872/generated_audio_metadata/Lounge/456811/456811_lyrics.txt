I got a message from the one they left behind
I found the door was open so I walked inside
I put the Bible in my pencil case
I turned away, I walked away from this place
You kissed me on the mouth a long long time ago
Before the waters came
And we knew which way the wind was gonna blow
There were drawings of angels on the wall above my head
Let's cross the railroad, watch the wind turbines
The screeching sound, the traffic whines
The sweat is sour as it ripples down my skin
I let it out, then I shut it in
You kissed me on the mouth a long long time ago
Before the waters came
And we knew which way the wind was gonna blow
There were drawings of angels on the wall above my bed
You're either halfway to heaven
Or you're halfway to hell
I wash myself of the stench
But I still smell the smell
You kissed me on the mouth
A long long time ago
Before the waters came
And we knew which way the wind was gonna blow
You kissed me on the mouth
A long long time ago
Before the waters came
And we knew which way the wind was gonna blow
There were drawings of angels on the wall above my head
