I am yearning do you hear
The sound of lost goodbye
I'm crazy to the touch of you
You always wonder why
Caught a glimpse of something
I thought it might be your intent
The way you moved tonight at me
And how you don't make sense
In my eyes, I see you
In my eyes, there you are
In my eyes, fire's and brings me to your eyes
Who could ever know the ending
Or even how we start
A simple roof across a room
And a flooded heart
In my eyes, I see you
In my eyes, there you are
In my eyes, to your eyes
In my eyes
In my eyes
