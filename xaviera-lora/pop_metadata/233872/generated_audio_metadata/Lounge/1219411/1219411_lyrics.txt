How does one care if one has to move?
Satisfied with what you've found?
Come, fall, inside, I feel satisfied
Which way should I?
Fall, inside, I feel satisfied
Birds watch and fall asleep
How does one care if one has to be satisfied?
Which has you fed?
Does one care if one has to be satisfied?
Please watch him fall
Come, smile, in front of me
Satisfy, which makes you mine
Come, smile, in front of me
Satisfy
First question, first
