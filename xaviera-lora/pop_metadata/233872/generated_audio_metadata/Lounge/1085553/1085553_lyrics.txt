I feel so worried, I'm lost now
Paralyzed, paralyzed
Please don't tell me
That I'm mad, you don't mind
You don't know what is grey
Don't pretend this is a lie
You don't know what it's like
Don't pretend this is a lie
A field of worry, I'm lost now
Paralyzed, paralyzed
Please don't tell me that I'm dead
You don't mind
You don't know
What it's like
Don't pretend this
Is a lie
You don't know
What it's like
Don't pretend this
Is a lie
But you don't know what is cry
Don't pretend this is a lie
You don't know what is cry
Don't pretend this is a lie
