Still going through the days
It seems like you have gone your own way
And I wonder if you know
That every day I miss you all the same
The same
Still going through the days
It seems like you've gone your own way
And I wonder if you know
That every day I miss you all the same, the same
Play the record on
Let the needle skip
I wanna get gone
On a beautiful trip
I wanna get gone
On a beautiful trip
Where did the soul go now
Where did the soul go now
Can you come back somehow
Can you come back somehow
Where did the soul go now?
Where did the soul go now?
Can you come back somehow?
Can you come back somehow?
Can you come back somehow?
Can you come back somehow?
I don't know what to say, what to say, what to say, what to say, what to say, what to say, what to say, what to say, what to say, what to say, what to say, what to say, what to say, what to say, what to say, what to say, what to say, what to say, what to say
(Watch your back, watch your back, watch your back)
