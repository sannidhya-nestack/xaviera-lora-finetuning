Comin' home now, Pally
Comin' home now, Kitty
Comin' home now, Pally
Comin' home to your daddy
Pick it again
Come on
Pick it again
He likes to run
I never know what they'll come on
Come on home now, Pally
Come on home now, Kitty
Come on home now, Pally
Come on home
Doomdah
He likes to rub
I never know when they'll come home
