No I wouldn't dare
To be in front of you
I thought it would be
Nice to let these words
Somehow to say thank you
For not being here in any way
For rubbing your name out of my chalkboard
Out of my lucky head
To her bye
Thank you and I wish you well
Be gone, oh teacher don't feel sad
And don't look back for this girl is not meant for you
Neither summers or any sense
It got to be funky
I wanted to say this lovely morning
I'm feeling like I used to
When I was a child
And the last paper was over
And as I walked home
The name of the last
Of those hunting kings
From the middle age
Got off my lucky head
Said goodbye
Thank you and I wish you well
Be gone, oh teacher, don't feel sad
And don't look back, for this girl is not meant for you
Neither summers or rain days ends
So you're the great, for God and no one
Wherever you are, I'm on the middle age
And I thank you for being here
I adore the new blank you left
I just can't wait to explore that childless rain
That's in my lucky head
So hey bye, thank you and I wish you well
Be gone, or the church don't feel sad
And don't look back, for this girl is not meant for you
Neither summer nor Renaissance
So head by, thank you and I wish you well
Be gone, or future don't feel sad
And don't look back, for this girl is not meant for you
Neither the summers nor any sand
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
