Echoes in the night where you once lay
The gentle sway from light surrounding
Silence whispers your name again
In the shadows, I'd softly be dead
Whispered secrets, love unspoken
Dreams in twilight
Where we'd both meet
Endless sky, caressing softly
Feel warm as dawn breaks in
In the shadows, I'd softly be dear
Whispered secrets that have unspoken
Lost in moments, time suspended
Eternal night, bound in love
In the shadows, I'd softly be dead
Whispered secrets that have unspoken
