Wasted, it's wasted, wasted
Wasted
It's wasted
I look back
And tears drop from my eyes
Can't believe
What's left of me today you were mine
And I was always yours never knew
That the end will ever come (play it)
Late, my wasted years
Late, late, my wasted years
Late
Lays my wasted years
Lays
Lays my wasted years
You promised
And I believed you gave you my all
And you tore me apart, I let go
Just to, just to make you happy
And now you throw everything
Everything, everything I've worked for
Play it, play it
My wasted years, play it
Lay it, my wasted years, lay it
Lay it, my wasted years, lay it
Lays my wasted years
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Play it
Play it
The way that feels
Play it
Lay it, my wasted years
Lay it
Lay it, my wasted years
Lay it
Lay it, my wasted years
Late, my wasted years
Late, late, my wasted years
Late
Late, my wasted years
Late
Late, my wasted years
