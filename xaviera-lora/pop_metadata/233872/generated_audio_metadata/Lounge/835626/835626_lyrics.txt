In the sky for the sound of blues
I can cry, walk without shoes
In the sky for the sound of blues
I can cry, walk without shoes
In the sky for the sound of blues
I can cry, walk without shoes
In the sky for the sound of blues
I can cry walk without shoes
In the sky for the sound of blues
I can cry walk without shoes
In the sky for the sound of blues
I can cry
Unpleasant roots coming from roots
Bee can't try not to cry
Unpleasant roots coming from roots
Bee can't try not to cry
Walk without shoes
In the sky
For the sound of blues
I can't cry
Walk without shoes
In the sky
For the sound of blues
I can't cry
Walk without shoes
In the sky
For the sound of blues
I can cry, walk without shoes
In the sky, for the sound of blues
I can cry, walk without shoes
In the sky, for the sound of blues
I can cry, walk without shoes
In the sky, for the sound of blues
I can't cry, walk without shoes
In the sky, for the sound of blues
I can't cry, walk without shoes
In the sky, for the sound of blues
I can't cry, unpleasant truths
Coming from roots
Bee can't try
Not to cry
Unpleasant roots coming from roots
We can try not to cry
