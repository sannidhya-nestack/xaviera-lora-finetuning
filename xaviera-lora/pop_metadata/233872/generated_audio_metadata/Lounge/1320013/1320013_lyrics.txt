I stroll through streets of could've been
The dreams I chase, the places I've been
But the mirror's size reflects it clear
Take me as I am, I'm staying here
Oh, life don't need no polished plan
It bends and breaks just like we can
So love the cracks where the light shines in
Take me as I am, let life begin
I danced on paths where stars don't glow
Through alleyways where winds won't blow
But every twist and every turn
Showed me the lessons I had to learn
No need to fix what's scarred and worn
The flowers grow where hearts are torn
Through every shadow, every fall
I found the beauty in it all
Oh, life don't need no polished plan
It bends and breaks just like we can
So love the cracks where the light shines in
Take me as I am, let life begin
So here I stand, no mask, no guise
With all the storms that shaped my skies
Not perfect yet, but enough somehow
Take me as I am, I'm here now
So here I stand, no mask, no guise
With all the storms that shaped my skies
Not perfect yet, but enough somehow
Take me as I am, I'm here enough
Oh, life don't need no polished plan
It bends and breaks just like we can
So love the cracks where the light shines in
Take me as I am, let life begin
