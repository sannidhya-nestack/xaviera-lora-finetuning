Oh well well well
I like your eyes they make me happy
Like the rolling deep blue sea
I kinda like the way you take me
To places what will be will be
There ain't too many people
And borrow my bleeding soul
I make my money making money
I make my time watching you
I'd never be too much a burden
I got better things to do
There ain't too many people
Who borrow my bleeding soul
I think the cravings that I feel for you
Have got me living on the door
I kinda like to watch you breathing
I also like to watch TV
Life's full of so many toys and things
Would you like to come and play with me?
Tell me, where can I find the shoes I need to wear?
Has anybody got a dime for my fabricated despair?
Blossoming welfare, and I'm thinking that I'm good for you
So I am cha-cha-cha, hey-hey-hey, oh, hey-hey, hey-hey
