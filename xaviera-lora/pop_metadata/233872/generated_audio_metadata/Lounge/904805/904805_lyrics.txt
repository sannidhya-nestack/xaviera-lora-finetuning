The snow has settled once again
A feeling I can't comprehend
I take a moment to reflect
And view my life in retrospect
My heart from you I disconnect
And artifact to my regret
You watch
The credits of your life
The moments passed you by
Left you behind
These are the pictures of my friends
And just for now I can pretend
Their photographs above the stairs
A souvenir of my despair
I could be the perfect ghost
But I'm the last one at the party
You watch the credits of your life's past in mind's past
You've all left you behind, left you behind
You find an old familiar room
Invite the ghosts to sing to you
And like a ghost sing to you
You watch
The credits of your life pass
In my ears past
You run
(And you'll be heard)
And you'll be heard
You watch
The credits of your life (always passed)
In mornings past, you go (and you leave behind)
In a magic showcase
In a magic showcase
In photographic memories
Night ghosts sing to you (oh you)
(In a fantasy sound)
With credits of your work (in my wings)
In my wings, past you go (and you belong)
I'm feeling like a child again
The minutes of your life
Come on, it's past, it's been millions past
You've all left you behind
Light goes out, oh you watch
The credits of your life
In the wings passed you by
Left you behind
A cinematic showcase, a cinematic showcase, a cinematic showcase
I feel it run through my soul (I feel it run through my soul)
Can't afford to worry, can't afford to worry (I feel it run through my soul)
I feel it run through my soul
