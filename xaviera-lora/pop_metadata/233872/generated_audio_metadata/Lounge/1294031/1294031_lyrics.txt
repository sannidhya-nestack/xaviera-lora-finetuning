Baby, I'm done
Baby, I'm out of show
Baby, I'm done
Baby, I'm out of show
I spend too much time in the world
Every chance must go
Every night I'm ready and I'm wrong
So, baby, I'm down for
Pittsburgh, the old man's downstairs (bitch)
Pittsburgh, the old man's downstairs
The new beats for the young guns are there
The new beats for the young guns are there
The new beats for the young guns are there
The new beats for the young guns are there
The new beat's gonna be down then, so step
The new beat's gonna be down then, so step
The new beat's gonna be down then
