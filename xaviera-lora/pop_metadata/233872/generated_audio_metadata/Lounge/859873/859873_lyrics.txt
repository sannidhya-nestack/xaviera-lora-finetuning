If I could ask a million questions
That would leave me wanting more
That's why I let you do the talking
Maybe that's what talking's for
I do my best to learn to listen
Seems you have so much to say
If I connect with your position
I will learn so much that way
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ah-ah-ah
If I could ask a million questions
That would leave me wanting more
That's why I let you do the talking
Maybe that's what talking's for
I do my best to learn to listen
Seems you have so much to say
If I connect with your position
I will learn so much that way
And I could ask a million questions
That would leave me wanting more
That's why I let you do the talking
Maybe that's what talk is for
I'll do my best to learn to listen
Since you have so much to say
If I connect with your position
I will learn so much that way
