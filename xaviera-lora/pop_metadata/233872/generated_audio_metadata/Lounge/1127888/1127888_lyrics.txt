Another way down the ocean
I hate my big dreams
I wanna tell them always stay in my mind
And do it without the issues
I hate all my fears
Never know them, so try to revisit my mind
Monsters of someone I remember forever
Emotions of my life I remember
Here's a need please, I can't breathe without you
Here I am free, I can't breathe without you
Here's a need please, I can't breathe without you
Here I am free, I can't breathe without you
And in the wake of the ocean, I make my big plea
I wanna tell you all the things in my mind
And in the wake of the ocean, I hate on my feet
Never know the hand that tried to reach it in my eyes
Emotions of someone, I remember forever
Emotions of love, I remember
Here's a need break I can't break without hoping
Here I am free I can't break without you
Here's a need break I can't break without hoping
Here I am free I can't break without you
