Fist bump, fist bump, fist bump
When every road you travel
Is just another dead end
And every enemy you meet
Was once a trusted friend
You've burned all your bridges
And now you're all alone
Can't find a friend or family
Or a place that feels like home
You can walk away
You can break free
Just be who you are
And who you wanna be
There's always gonna be another new day
Don't ever let them tell you
That there ain't no other way
You can walk away
You can break free
Just be who you are
And who you wanna be
You can walk away
You can break free
