Our week's been a mess, we're feeling the stress
All work no play, girl, let's call it a day
And get lost together
So lost together, baby
Jump in the car, we can head for a start
Together we'll go and I'd even we know
Just lost together
Let's get lost together
Not a care in where we're going
What's ahead not knowing
Our grand escape will lead us God knows where
Whoa
A day or two we'll unwind
Leave that mess far behind
We'll find a place where paradise is ours, oh
Monday soon will come
Back to all the undone
So'til then, girl, let's get lost together
Not a care in where we're going
What's ahead not knowing
A grand escape will lead us God knows where
A day or two, we'll unwind
Leave that mess so far behind
We'll find a place where paradise is ours, oh
Monday soon will come
Back to all the undone
So till then girl let's get lost together
Let's get lost together, ooh
Let's get lost together baby
Let's get lost together
Let's get lost together
