He is watching, waiting for you
When you give up all that you've got to leave behind
Leaving, watching, waiting, hoping
Making plans that all we might can't see
Wandering wandering
Over long long days
Knowing they will never end
Optimistic, you've lost him forever now
Keep it watching me
Keep running, running, running, running, running, running, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Beaming, watching, waiting, hoping
Beaming, watching, waiting, hoping
Making plans that only mind can see
Wondering, wondering, never aging
Don't worry to realize a plan
Of certainty
Tomorrow will do
Forever now, forever now, forever now
How blissful is this illusion
Life is forever, death is never
(duck quacking)
