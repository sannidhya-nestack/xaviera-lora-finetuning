You on the window
Sunrise creeps softly
We sip the warmth
Body slow
Whispers in the air
We dance through dreams
Feeling serene
In soft morning glow
Let it all unfold
As melody flows
Sounds lush and hazy
Float into the room
We blend in this way
Merge with the tune
Echoes all around
Composed we find
We breathe in soft morning glow
Let it all unfold
A splendid eflow
Slow winds, gentle winters
Slept in the sun, rise with the sun
Spread the warmth around
We breathe in soft morning glow
Let it all unfold
As melody flows
