There's no reason, no time or season
It feels like treason to give my heart away
I've been wined, wooed, heard every line, cooed
Still not inclined to give my heart away
Maybe others like to run around
With their feelings on their sleeves
But to me that only brings me down
Don't need dancing, romancing, or some guy's advancings
I'm not concealing or double dealing
But it's gonna be the real thing when I give my heart away
Well you won't find me falling on my knees
From whispered nothings in my ear
Takes more than words to turn me on now please
Don't try baiting, placating, I'm not deviating
So there's no reason, no time or season
It feels like treason now to give my heart away
I've been wind-wooed, heard every line, could
Still not inclined to give my heart away
'Cause it's gonna be the real thing baby when I give my heart away
