Dis-moi que tu m'aimes, dis-moi juste que tu m'aimes parce que moi j'oserais jamais te le dire la première j'aurais trop peur que tu croies que c'est un jeu, sauf moi, je t'en prie
I'm just a bird in a hole
'Cause you don't have (x4)
S'il vous plaît, je t'en prie.
You could be the death of me
'Cause to me you're everything
Baby don't let go of me
All I want is you and me
You could be the death of me
to me you're everything
Baby don't let go of me
All I want is you and me
Keep holding on
Say, are we hanging on?
Keep standing strong
Say
I'll be hanging on
Keep holding on
Say I'll be hanging on
Keep standing strong
Stay, I'll be hanging on
How you playing me so good
I guess I never thought you would
Oh I wish that I had understood
Darling we could never be so good
