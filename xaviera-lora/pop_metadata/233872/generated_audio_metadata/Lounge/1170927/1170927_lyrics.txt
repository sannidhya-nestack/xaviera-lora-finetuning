Said we don't stop when the lights turn on
Cause I still see you in the dark
We don't go home when the bar shuts down
No baby keep me spinning round
Tell me go on till the feelings gone
Cause I can't do this all alone
We can ball out, yeah, the night is young
Don't let me do this on my own
Bring it on, na-na-na-na-na
Bring it on, yeah, keep me going strong
Bring it on, na-na-na -na-na

Bring it on, na-na-na-na-na
Bring it on, yeah, keep me going strong
Bring it on, na-na-na-na-na

Said we don't stop when the lights turn on
Cause I still see you in the dark
We don't go home when the bar shuts down
No baby keep me spinning around
Tell me go on till the feeling is gone
Cause I can't do this all alone
We can ball out, yeah, the night is young
Don't let me do this on my own
Bring it on, na-na-na-na-na
Bring it on, yeah, keep me going strong
Bring it on, na-na-na-na-na
