Now that I have peace of mind
I realize that without you I'll be fine
Now that I have peace of mind
I realize that without you I'll be fine
I'll be fine
It is true, I thought you
Were the one, were the one
But now I've found a love so warm, so warm
It's like staring right at the sun, the sun, the sun, yeah
Through all the madness I've learned
To love myself yeah
To love myself yeah
For now I put the madness on the shelf
That I am a piece of mine
I realize that without you I'll be fine
Now that I have peace of mind
Realize that without you I'll be fine, be just fine
I never thought I'd be over you
I found a love (found a love)
Found a love (found a love)
That's a world (that's a world) yeah
It's like staring at the sun or the light
Now that I have peace of mind
I realize that without you I'll be fine
Like yeah, peace of mind
Now that I have peace of mind
I realized that without you I'll be fine, I'll be fine
I never thought I'd be over you
I found a love, found a love, found a love, found a love
That's the one, that's the one, yeah
It's like staring at the sun or a light
Now that I have peace of mind
I realize that without you I'll be fine
I get peace of mind
Now that I have peace of mind
I've realized that without you I'll be fine, I'll be fine
