Doesn't get the sun like you
Makes me excited
Follow me with your eyes, I believe
How much you fantasize about this, about this
How can I know that you won't desert me
Oh you will know
Like you
Oh you will know
How can I know that you won't desert me
Oh you will know
Doesn't get the sun like you
Makes me excited
Follow me with your eyes, I believe
How much you fantasize about this, about this
How can I know that you won't desert me
Oh you will know
Like you
Oh you will know
How can I know that you won't desert me
Oh you will know
Doesn't get the sun
Like you
Makes me excited
Follow me with your eyes
I believe
How much you fantasize about this, about this
How can I know that you won't desert me
Oh you will know
