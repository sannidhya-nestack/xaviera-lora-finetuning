I'd never change you in a million ways
I'd just keep changing my mind
Would this be true?
Who's the man who?
The secret's your thigh
That's right
I'd never use you in a million years
I'd just keep using these lines
I'm pretty sure
I got a cure
For the fear in your eyes
That's right
Don't be shy
I said
Don't be shy
I am determined to relieve this room
You just been lonely too long
I say no more
You shut the door
Get with it now now come on
Yeah
Don't be shy
I said
Don't be shy
Don't be shy
I said
Don't be shy
