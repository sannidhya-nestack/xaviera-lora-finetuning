Paper roses are held up to smell
Paper roses
I hold close to my chest And I breathe in the fragrance of a long time ago
When love was a perfume I smoked'em through my soul
Paper windows are let out through now
Paper windows to feel the breeze come through
And I breathe in the freshness of a long time ago
Then I float like a butterfly filled with the colors of life
Paper boats I hold onto now
Paper boats with sails bent by tears
And I breathe in the salty air of a long time ago
I hang on to the tide that sweeps me away from you
And I breathe in the toastiness of a long time ago
When I was new to love and its wintery nights
Paper clouds
I reach out for time as it falls by
Paper clocks
I've drawn my own firelight
And I breathe in the taste of a long time ago
A song which never moves past mine
Broken mind
