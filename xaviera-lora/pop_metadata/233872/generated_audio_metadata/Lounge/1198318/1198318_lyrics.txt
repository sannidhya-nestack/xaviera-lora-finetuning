You know how hard it gets
When I'm alone, I'm alone and in my head
You know how time just dies
When you're on, when you're on my mind
All my fears are coming alive
I cannot see you be shining so bright
All my beauty is lost on you
Give me hope, give me love, gonna run if I wanted to
You don't know how hard it gets
When I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm in my head
You don't know how time just dies
When you're on, when you're on my mind
All my fears are coming alive
I cannot see you, but you're shining so bright
All my beauty is lost on you
Gimme hug, gimme love, gonna run if I wanted to
