Reading your messages on my phone
Words that you sent me late at night
Your thoughts in pixels fill my mind
Simple emotions, perfect signs
Reading your messages
Heart starts to race
Lost in the moment
A digital embrace
Your laughter echoes in each line
Captured forever on my screen
Every emoji makes me smile
Sharing our secrets all the while
Reading your messages
Heart starts to race
Lost in the moment
A digital embrace
Reading your messages
Heart starts to race
Lost in the moment
A digital embrace
