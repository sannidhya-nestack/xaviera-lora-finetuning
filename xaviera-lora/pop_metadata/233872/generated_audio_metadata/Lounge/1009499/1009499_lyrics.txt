Deep below the city lights I find sweet memories to clear my mind
You turn the lights up high
Much deeper blue than any sky
The sun it sets across the dunes
There's no regrets for me and you
High above the city nights
The incense burns from candlelight
Exotic prints and tapestries
They fill the senses and the eyes
Deep below the city lights
Coloured memories of my mind
