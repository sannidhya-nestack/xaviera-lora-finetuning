And you should understand the mistakes are but natural
I missed you, I knew it not
I thought I found you but it was thought
I tried to rhyme unrelated words
And my poetry won the day, but I lost your heart
My song was called for rain, only the sun did its part
And the rain's a-rolling ahead
The days and nights not so bad
And the rhymes keep me high
On how always do they head?
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
And the rhymes are all I have
Of days and nights not so bad
And the rhymes keep me high
I'll help always to the very end.
And the rhymes are all I had
The days and nights not so bad
And the rhymes keep me high
Oh not always do they add
And the rhymes are all I had
Of days and nights not so bad
And the rhymes keep me high
On how always do they end
