This escape is a loaded gun
It's a bullet into the sun
Shining light over everyone
Till the moon evicts another one
Burning fire elevates the night
Shadows dance in the candlelight
Smoke and mirrors tell us we're alright
As long as the stars they keep on shining bright
This escape is a loaded gun
It's a bullet into the sun
Shining light over everyone
Till the moon evicts another one
Burning fire elevates the night
Shadows dance in the candlelight
Smoke and mirrors tell us we will rise
As long as the stars they keep on shining bright
This escape is a loaded gun
It's a bullet into the sun
Shining light over everyone
Till the moon evicts another one
Burning fire elevates the night
Shadows dance in the candlelight
Smoke and mirrors tell us we're alright
As long as the stars they keep on shining bright
This escape is a loaded gun
It's a bullet into the sun
Shining light over everyone
Till the moon emits another one
Burning fire elevates the night
Shadows dance in the candlelight
Smoking mirrors tell us we'll arrive
As long as the stars they keep on shining bright
Shining light over everyone
Till the moon evicts another one
Burning fire elevates the night
Shadows dance in the candlelight
Smoke and mirrors tell us we're alright
As long as the stars they keep on shining bright
