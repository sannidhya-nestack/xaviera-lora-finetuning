Baby doll
Is bent but not broken
Shattered dreams
Have worn her thin
Where two hearts meet
There is always desperation
Just one look
Can make the whole world sin
Yesterday her sun was shining
And today she is flying
Baby doll is good at staying silent
Bites her lips
To quench her thirst
Takes a breath
And sets the stars in motion
The stage is set
For Fairyland
Yesterday the sun was shining
And today she is flying
Baby doll is cold in the summer
Gets relief in the eye of the storm
Lives her life
Like a puzzle
She is like the sun and moon in love
Yesterday the sun
Her sun was shining
And today she is fine
