Follow me with your eyes, I believe how much you fantasize about this, about this
Back home, they don't know me back home
They want me to believe in things I told them no
Back home, it's like a cage for me
Back home, I will not be who you'll be
I want my own, my time
I'm afraid of it
How can I know that you won't desert me?
Rock in the ocean
Doesn't get the sun like you
Have you got mixed feelings? I mean
Have you got these old things? I love this world
Imperfections of this world
Imperfections of this world
Don't you see I'm perfect like you
Ooh, not anymore
To complicate these things
Makes me excited, oh
Respect me, infect me with your love
Respect me, inspect me for your imperfections
Eat the way she lies
It's like a disease eating your eyes
The way she moves
Eat the way she moves it's a warning
The way she moves is so enchanting
The way she moves
The way she moves
The way she moves
The way she moves
A warning
A warning
Warning, warning
Power through these old city streets
I'll be who I wanna be
Power through these old city streets
I'll be who I wanna be
I'll be who I wanna be
I'll be who I want to be
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Power through all these old city streets
I'll be who I wanna be
Ooh
