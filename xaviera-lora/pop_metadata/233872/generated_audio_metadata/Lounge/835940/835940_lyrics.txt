It's three thirty a .m. and you're in my thoughts again
And you'll be there for a while, no doubt
I'm just waiting for dawn
Wondering where we went wrong
But then when I finally figure it out
I go off into a dream
And the dream is telling me
Relax, it's three thirty a .m.
All I have is 3 .30 AM
All I have is 3 .30 AM
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
