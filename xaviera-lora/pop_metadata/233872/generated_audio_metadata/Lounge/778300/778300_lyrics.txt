[MUSIC PLAYING]
You
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Too many questions in paradise
Your mind is cold as ice
You left before the sun would rise
There are so many questions in paradise
Too many questions in paradise
Your mind is cold as ice
You left before the sun would rise
Too many questions in paradise
Your mind is cold as ice
You left before the sun would rise
There are so many questions in paradise
