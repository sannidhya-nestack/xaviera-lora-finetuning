Good beat, good beat, good beat
I could be, I could be, I could be, I could be, I could be, I could be, I could be, I could be, I could be, I could be, I could be
Good beat
Make those beating in my heart
Mister mister dance with me
You're blind to all the love each way
Mister mister dance with me
Make them speaking in my heart
Mister mister dance with me
You're blind to all the love between
Mister mister dance with me
I'll be there, I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be there
Good beat, good beat, good beat, good beat, good beat
Good beat, good beat, good beat, good beat, good beat, good beat
I said, I'm a good bitch, I'm a good bitch
Make this beating in my heart
Mister mister dance with me
You're blind to all the love between
Mister mister dance with me
Make this beating in my heart
Mister mister dance with me
You're blind to all the love between
Mister mister dance with me
Make them speaking in my heart
Mister mister dance with me
You're blind to all the love each way
Mister mister dance with me
Make this beating in my heart
Mister mister dance with me
You're blind to all the love between
Mister mister dance with me
