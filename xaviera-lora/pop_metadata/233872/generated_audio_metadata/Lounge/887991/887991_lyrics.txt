Girl, there's a mess around
Girl, there's a mess around
There's a mess around
There's a night surround
Girl
There's a night surround
Girl
There's a night surround
There's a mess around
There's a mess around
Where do you think you're going?
You look so guilty
You know, subtlety never got you this far
Lay on the couch
At first glance, worth a million dollars, but you're not a business
Drunk boys, shining as sun
Girl
There's a mess around
Girl, doesn't mess around
Girl, there's a night surround
Girl, there's a mess around
There's a mess around
There's a mess around
