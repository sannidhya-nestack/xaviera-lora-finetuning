Like a circle
No beginning
Love is endless
Never ending
Don't want you
Don't want you
Don't want you
Don't want you
Don't want you
Don't want you
Don't want you
Like a circle
No beginning
Love is endless
Never ending
Ordinary people chasing stars
Stop and wonder who they really are
But the circles keep on closing around them
Fascinating fires draw them in
Promises of love thrown to the wind
But the circle's never open for them
Like a circle, no beginning
Love is endless, never ending
Life may suck up
No big deal
Love is endless
Never ending
I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I am not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go,
Life is a hell of no beginning
Love is endless, never ending
Go on and, go on and, go on and, go on and
Go on and, go on and, go on and
Don't want it, don't want it
