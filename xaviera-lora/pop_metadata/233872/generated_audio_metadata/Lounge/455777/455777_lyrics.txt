I'll wipe your tears away
And I'll sit you to sleep
You showed me how to dance
Yeah you're a friend I can keep
I will hold onto you
You can guide, guide me through
I will hold, onto you
You can guide, guide me through
And I
I will walk a long line
I won't return until you're mine
We just keep on wasting time
I will give you my love
I'll stay with you until the end
I'll always have a hand to lend
I will always be yours (I'm always gonna see your face)
I wish I was out of this place (And here)
You will be in my arms (I wanna be with you again)
I wanna be with you again
Again
Again (again)
Again (again)
Again (again)
I'll wipe your tears away
Yeah
You showed me how to dance
How to dance
I'm with you again
With you again
Yeah, I'm with you again
