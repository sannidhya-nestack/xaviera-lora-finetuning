Get in touch with happiness
See the light in your eyes
It's hard enough to understand
Feel the love hold my hand
Now the wind has turned into storm
Feeling alone
I feel alone
And when you're alone, get somebody, somebody who cares
You feel the beat get in motion
And when you're lonesome, get yourself, you take care
You feel the beat get in motion
Wondering what we have done'til dawn has come
Time has disappeared in your smile
How long, for and why?
Now the wind has turned into storm
I'm feeling alone (I'm feeling alone)
Still feeling alone (still feeling alone)
And when you're alone, get somebody
Somebody who cares, you feel the beat, get in motion
And when you're lonesome, get yourself
You take care, you feel the beat, get emotional
And when you're alone, got somebody
Somebody who cares
You feel the beat, get emotional
And when you're lost, don't get yourself
You take care, you feel the beat, get emotional
