I think I need a break
Don't care how long it takes
You know I hate the way you
Lie to me
You make me feel so dark
You really broke my heart
You opened up my scars
Took the high road when I let go
I was scared to fall but I took it slow
Now I'm flying cloud nine and
When I'm on my own yeah I lose control
Why do you do this?
Raining the moment
Couldn't see your behavior was toxic for me
Eternal optimist
I make the best of it
Couldn't see your behavior was toxic for me
I think I need a break
Don't care how long it takes
You know I hate the way you
Lie to me
You make me feel so dark
You really broke my heart
You opened all my scars
Why do you do this, when in the moment
Couldn't see your behavior was toxic for me
Eternal optimist, I make the best of it
Couldn't see your behavior was toxic for me
