It's a confession
I need affection
So much distraction
Yeah, I want your attention
I need your connection
Why you keep on hiding me
You know what you're feeling
Why you keep avoiding us, it's true
I know, I know you heard before
But you know I got everything that we wish for
Why you keep avoiding me
You know what you're feeling
Why you keep avoiding us
It's true
Don't need to hide anymore
I'm at your side, oh
Oh
Why you keep avoiding me
You know what you're feeling
Why you keep avoiding us
It's true
I need your connection
I need your connection
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
