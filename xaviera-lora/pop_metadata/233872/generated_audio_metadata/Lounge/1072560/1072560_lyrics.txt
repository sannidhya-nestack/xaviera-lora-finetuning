Even if we fight, it's all alright
Even if we yell, we'll be fine by tonight
we can break up, but we won't make up
Like we always do
Even if I say I don't love you
You know it's not true
Cause loving's what we do
And I love you
Even if I say I don't love you
You know it's not true
Cause loving's what we do
And I love you
And I love (and I love) and I love (and I love) and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and, I love, and I love, and I love
And I love (and I love) and I love (and I love) and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love, and I love (and i love), and i love), and i love (and i love), and i lovve), and i lovve (and i lovve), and i lovve (and i lovve), and i lo
