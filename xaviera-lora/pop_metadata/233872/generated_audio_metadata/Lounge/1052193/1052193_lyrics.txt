That look, one sweet look
You gave me your number that night in September
I was cold and all frozen
Your arms wrapped around me, I know you remember
Yeah I love you so down to nothing
It's been weeks now without talking
It is time you give me something
I've given, given my everything
Given my, given my everything
Give it my, give it my everything
Give it my everything
Yeah, love, you're so down to nothing
It's been weeks, not without talking
It is time you give me something
I've given, given my everything
Give him my everything (give him my everything, give him my everything, give him my everything, give him my everything, give him my everything, give him my everything, give him my everything, give him my everything, give him my everything, give him my everything, give him my everything, give him my everything, give him my everything)
Giving my, giving my everything
Giving my everything
Giving my, giving my everything
Giving my, giving my everything
Give them my everything
