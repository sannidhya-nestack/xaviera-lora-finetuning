Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
In the ways of the weak, the times when you think, I know
You're the fight, the cream, the strength in me, I know
And you're driving, driving, driving, driving me crazy
You keep on running and running and running and running lately
Slow down, you go too fast, love
I'm telling slow down, I can't keep up, love
Your heart is shrinking faster
And baby there's no laughter coming out of your mouth
Out of your soul, out of your soul
I'm wasted, keep running
Impatient, sweet lover
I'm wasted, keep running
Impatient, sweet lover
In the ways of the weak
The time's been bleak, I know
You're the fight, the cream, the strength in me, I know
And you're driving, driving, driving, driving me crazy
You keep on running and running and running and running
Slow down, you go too fast love
I'm telling slow down, I can't keep up love
Your heart is shrinking faster than baby
There's no laughter coming out of your mouth
Out of your soul, out of your soul
I'm wasted, keep running
Impatient, sweet lover
I'm wasted, keep running
Impatient sweet lover
