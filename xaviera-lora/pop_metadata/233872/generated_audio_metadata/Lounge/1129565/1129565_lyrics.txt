Can't get you out of my mind
Feels like I'm losing time
Wish I could hold you, tell you I'm sorry
But I know it's too late to try
Things don't always work out the way that they should
People don't always work out the way that they should
So I'm gonna let it go
I'm gonna let it go
You said goodbye in the night
All I could do was cry
I wish I could hold you, tell you I'm sorry
But I know it's too late to try
Things don't always work out the way that they should
People don't always work out the way that they should
So I'm gonna let it go
I'm gonna let it go
(I'll be down, I'll be down)
Can't get you out of my mind
Feels like I'm losing time
I wish I could hold you, tell you I'm sorry
But I know it's too late to try
Things don't always work out the way that they should
People don't always work out the way that they should
So I'm gonna let it go
I'm gonna let it go
So I'm gonna let it go
I'm gonna let it go
