Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah
When the day's done and the flowers leave from the sun
All the times I've said I'm new
Behind those closed curtains
Behind those closed curtains, who are you?
Leaving us behind until we die so slowly
Do you need an escape?
Do you need an escape? I'll be the hatchway for you
I'll be the hatchway for you
I know you're a monster
The monster I knew
The monster I knew
The monster
Resonates
Resonates
I won't leave you behind
I'm free
So slowly
And the days they come and go so slowly
Who are you?
Who are you, yeah
Come with me
Your voice resonates
Your voice
I won't give up on you
I'll be your world
I'll be your world
I love you
So I just want to stick with the band I know
And it's all about me, baby, baby, baby
So I just want to stick with the band I know
And it's all about me, baby, baby, baby
