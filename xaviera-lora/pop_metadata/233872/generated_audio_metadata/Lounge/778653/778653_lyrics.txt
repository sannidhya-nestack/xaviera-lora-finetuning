I've been here a thousand times
Blowing out of my mind
You might say I'm blind
Out of sight and out of mind
I've tried to find
But I just keep on sinking deeper
I've lost my mind (you've got the key)
I'm incomplete, I'm dead, release me
Hold on, hold on
Nothing keeps me down
I'm strong, I'm so strong
Hit myself apart, throw you on (you've got the key)
Release me
You got the key
Release me
I've been here a thousand times, going out of my mind
You might say I'm blind, out of sight and out of mind, but I've tried to find
But I just keep on sinking deeper
I've lost the money (you got the money)
The empathy I'm getting (leaves me)
I hold on, I hold on
Nothing keeps me down
I'm strong, I'm so strong
Let myself go far so you are free
Release me
You got the key
I've been here a thousand times
Going out of my mind
And you might say I'm blind
Out of sight and out of mind
I tried to find
But I just keep on sinking deeper
I've lost the mark (you've got the key)
I'm incomplete, I'm getting weak (release me)
I hold on, I hold on
Nothing keeps me down
I'm strong, I'm so strong
Pick myself up off the ground
