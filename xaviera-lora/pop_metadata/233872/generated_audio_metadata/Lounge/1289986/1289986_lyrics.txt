Lost amongst the stars, dreaming in the night
Gentle whispers of the wind guide me on my fight
Floating on a sea of sound, embrace what may come
Cocooned in shadows, I wandered by the city's homes
Echo softly in my ears, a story undefined
Capture a rhythm of my heart, leave the world behind
And in this dreamy haste, love turns into light
Looping through eternity where wrong becomes right
Boundless is the sky held gently in my sight
In the glow of tonight
Let our souls ignite
Waiting through the gemstone
Maze of time and space
Hearts collide inside the joy
Lead without a trace
In this realm of endless dreams
Every breath is sewn
Held within the sweetest parts
Where we both belong
A drift in velvet, blistered sun
Twined in a glow
Gaze on through fields of stars
Where only love can grow
In this dreamy haze
Love turns into light
Looping through eternity
Where only comes right
Found the sweet sweet popcorn
Held gently in my sight
Here we go off tonight
Let our souls fly
Passing clouds
A journey sweet embrace
We find a peace so profound
In this timeless place
They call volume your pain
Sometimes I stay in your dreams
my brain is a trace
That you're beginning to lose
For I was here as an ease
And turned into a place of pain
Now this is the sky halogen in my sight
In the glow of tonight, tonight
Let our souls night
