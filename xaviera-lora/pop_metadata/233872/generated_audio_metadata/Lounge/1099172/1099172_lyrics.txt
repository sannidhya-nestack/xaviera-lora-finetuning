Cold and fire
Brings me closer to the goal
I'm running or I'm coming home
There's no way back cause I'm too far gone
Nobody knows where I should go
Where I should go
Where I should go
Cold and fire
Brings me close to the goal
I'm running or
I'm coming home
There's no way back
I'm too far gone
Nobody knows where I should go
Where I should go
Where I should go
I'm so far from home
Be my side when I'm lost, yeah
I'm too far to be with you
And you know
I'm so far from home
Get my side when I'm lost, yeah
I'm too far to be with you, and you know
I'm so far from home
Get my side when I'm lost, yeah
I'm too far to be with you, and you know
I'm so far from home
Be my side when I'm lost and
Out so far to be with you
And you know I'm so far from home
I'm so far from home
I'm so far from home
I'm so far from home
