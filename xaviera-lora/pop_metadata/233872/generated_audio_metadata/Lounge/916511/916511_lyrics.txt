Never had a love like this
A love so strong
A love that you think about all night long
Never had a love like this
A love so strong
A love that you think about all night long
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never had a love like this, a love so strong
A love that you think about all night long
Never had a love like this, a love so strong
A love that you think about all night long
Feel the truth, feel the truth, feel the truth, feel the truth
Feel the cold
