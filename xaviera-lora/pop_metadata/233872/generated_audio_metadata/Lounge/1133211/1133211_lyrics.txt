There's no way home
And I have no mercy
There's no way up
So I'm going down
Still I keep on living
So you pull me closer
When I have no mercy
Let's carry on
No reasons to stop it
I wouldn't do it on my own
I can't deny it
Still trying to build and trying to be
When we, when we
There's no way home
And I have no mercy
There's no way up
So I'm going down
Still I keep on living so you pull me closer
When I have no mercy
Let's carry on
No reasons to stop it
I wouldn't do it on my own
I can't deny it
Still trying to build and trying to be
When we, when we
Lifetime is short, your skin is soft
Feel bad if you, feel bad if you
Feel bad if you, feel bad if you
Feel bad if you
Feel better if you feel better if you feel better if you feel better
We're in touch, we're in touch, we're in touch
