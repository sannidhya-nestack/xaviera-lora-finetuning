Be a signal, star in the sky
But it seems when it matters most I
Don't notice'til I'm out of time
Out of time
Every time I see your signal
Wonder if I should pay mind
Should pay mind
Every day I see these signals
Know what they're all around, all around
But like everything in hindsight
Don't know'til I'm staring'em down, staring'em down
Declare it
Just the same way we declare war
That is how we will have peace
We just need to declare it
I swear I'll get it
Just give me one more sign
I swear I'll get it right
Just give me one more sign
Oh, these signals
Oh, signals
Whoa, these signals
Whoa, signals
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Two, one
I swear I'll get it right
Just give me one more sign
I swear I'll get it right
Just give me one more sign
And all these signals, whoa, signals
And all these signals, whoa, signals
