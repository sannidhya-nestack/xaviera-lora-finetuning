Moon rains on our skin, waves lapping soft shore
Night air cool and thin, we need nothing more
Our shadows blend in dense, hearts beating as one
Lost in this trance,'til the night is done
Slow dancing under moon rays
Melodies of night
Lost in the gentlest way
Everything feels right
Stars whisper our names
Light glows on your face
In this world no games
Just an endless embrace
Time fades like the tide
Hands touch, light as breeze
In this dream we glide
All worries at ease
Eyes closed, soft smile
Moments linger long
We'll stay for a while
To our own silent song
Slow dancing under the rays
Melodies all night
Lost in the gentle sway
Everything feels right
Stars whisper our names
Light glows on your face
In this world no games
Just an endless embrace
Stars whisper our names
Light glows on your face
In this world, no gaze
Just an endless embrace
