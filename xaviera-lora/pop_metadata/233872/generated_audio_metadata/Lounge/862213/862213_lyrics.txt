I can't stand the pain, I can't stand the pain, I can't stand the pain
Blanket me with warm and blinding sun
Follow footsteps in the sand with everyone
Ocean, Veda, tracks away
Long otten where this has begun
Who?
Who?
Who?
Who?
Blanket meal with warm and blinding sun
Follow footsteps in the sand with everyone
Ocean fades our tracks away
Long otten where this has begun
