Heal the pain, heal the weak
Heal the pain, heal the weak
Can you feel the sunlight, the sunlight in all your life
Can you feel the sunlight, the sunlight in all your life?
Halloween, Halloween
Can you feel the sunlight
The sunlight in all your life
Can you feel the sunlight
In your eyes
Here I lay, here I'll wait
Here I lay, here I'll wait
Can you feel the sunlight?
The sunlight in all your life
Can you feel the sunlight
The sunlight in all your life
Can you feel the sunlight
The sunlight in all your life
Can you feel the sunlight
The sunlight in all your life
Can you feel the sunlight, the sunlight in all your life
Can you feel the sunlight, the sunlight in all your life
