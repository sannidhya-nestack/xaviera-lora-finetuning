I'm so fragile
I don't expect you to realize
I'm so fragile
You're the only one I see
I'm so fragile
And when I crash into the ground I'm so fragile
You're the only one I see
I'm so fragile
I don't expect you to realize
I'm so fragile
You're the only one I see
I'm so fragile
And when I crash into the ground
I'm so fragile
You're the only one I see
Ah, ah, ah, ah
I'm so fragile
I don't expect you to realize
I'm so fragile
You're the only one I see
I'm so fragile
And when I crash into the ground
I'm so fragile
You're the only one I see
It seems to be correct and right
I can't repeal your vicious bites
I'm so glad I saw a light in you
And now I feel the biggest fool
I thought I saw a light in you
And now I feel the biggest fool
I thought I saw a light in you
And now I feel the biggest fool
I thought I saw a light in you
And now I feel the biggest fool
