Heavenly eyes, electric smile
To bring me down I'm on the wire
I'll burn out the flame on his lips
And light them again with your kiss
Oh I don't mean to be sad
But just thinking about him now makes it so hard
Oh I don't mean to be bad
But just thinking about the things that I can't help
And mama's seen this all before
She want me
Baby don't get too close
You see that
You end up second best
In the end you will have to settle for last
Don't get too close
Who on his early ifs with you kiss yay
Like his heavenly eyes electric smile
To bring me down I'm on the wire
I'll burn out the flame on his lips
And light them again one day with your kiss
Oh, I don't mean to be sad
But just thinking about him now makes it so hard
Oh, I don't mean to be bad
But just thinking'bout the things that I can't have
