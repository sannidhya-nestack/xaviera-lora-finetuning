Although I am sleeping or maybe I am dreaming
They touch me with their fingers and their odor lingers
Sometimes for hours through heavy showers
And they stay till morning till it's light and the sun shines
They come and I get warmer
And dance across my pillow
They go in spiral whispers
They are perfect listeners
Tell them all my secrets
They feed me tea and biscuits
It's a final union
Like the first day of creation
I gave my soul to someone
They told me they would keep it
And when I was finished
I'd know just where to find it
But they were lying
Because my eyes are open
And I have spoken
