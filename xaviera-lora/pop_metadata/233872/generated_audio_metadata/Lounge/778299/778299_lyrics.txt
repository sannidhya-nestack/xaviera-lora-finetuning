Helplessly I fall to you
Pulling me right back again to you
Everything feels new
Everything feels new
Shining bright to guide my way through
And right back to you
And right back to you
Endlessly I fall to you
In your arms I hold
Hold on to your heart
Everything feels new
Down to your heart
Lastly, I fall to you
Everything feels new
Everything feels new
Shining bright to guide my way
And right back to you
And right back to you
Endlessly I fall to you
In your
Hold on to your heart
