Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ah-a-a-a-ah
I'm so scared if I do show my feelings for you
Need to know what you're feeling
when I see you smile
My whole world comes alive
Can you feel me?
You are there when I sleep, all up in my dreams
Like a haunting memory
I'm afraid to admit, so afraid to commit
To what we're feeling
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ah, ooh-ooh, ooh-ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ah, ooh-ooh, ooh-ah
