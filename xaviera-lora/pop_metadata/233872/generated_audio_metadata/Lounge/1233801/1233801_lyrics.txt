When I find a way
I'll get back to you
When I find a day
Sunlight will shine blue
Singsong makes me take wing
To the small gap within
Which makes me sing
When I go away
I'll have this in my heart
When I see a bay of peace
This melody will play its part
Swing song makes me take wings
To the small gap within which makes me sink
