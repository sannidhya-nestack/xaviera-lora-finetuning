But I get the good, good, good, good, good, good
But I get the good, good, good, good, good, good
But I get the good, good, good, good, good, good
But I get the good, good, good, big
But I get the good, good, good, big
But I get the good, good, good, great big
But I get the good, good, great big
But I get the good, good, great big
But I get the good, good, great big
But I get the good, great big big
But I get the good, great big big
Staring in the mirror
Looks so great
The moon was shining purple
Blind and faceless all the day
Want to hear some smooth voice
Feeling alone
The bedroom was cool and dusty
I need someone to calm me down
The curtains are outside, they're painted blue
Some shadows next to me, I get the distance between me and you
When I wake up in the morning
Waiting for the free fall
The jumps inside my head never end
They never
Dream time, dream time
Story through the night
Dream time, dream time
Dream
Dream time, dream time
Story through the night
Dream time, dream time
The story
Staring in the mirror
Looks all grey
The moon was shining purple
Blind and faceless all the day, yeah
I want to hear some smooth words
Feeling alone
The bedroom was cool and dusty
I need someone to call me down
Down
Ba-ba-ba-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh, hey, yeah
Oh, hey, yeah
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-pa, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Dreamtime, dreamtime, story through the night
Dreamtime, dreamtime, let's start right
Dreamtime, dreamtime, story through the night
Dreamtime, dreamtime, dream
Dream, dream, dream, oh dream, dream, dreamtime (dreamtime, dreamtime)
Stories through the night, all through the night
Story through the night
Dream, dream, dream
A dream, dream, dream time
