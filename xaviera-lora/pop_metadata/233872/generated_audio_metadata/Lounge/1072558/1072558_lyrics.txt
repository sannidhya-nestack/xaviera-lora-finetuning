Oh my God, I felt too safe for too long
And I can't choke it out, it's growing too strong for me
It made me bad to hurt you like that and feel so good about it
The sin in your blood, the kind that I like and I shouldn't be around it
Now it's back again, it got me in the end
To be the death of me, a little piece of me
A little piece of me, oh, oh, oh
Lay me down
Push my back to the wall
And I don't understand
Don't know what took me so long
Oh no
It made me bad to hurt you like that
I feel so good about it
The sin in your blood, the kind that I like
And I shouldn't be around it
Now it's back again
It got me in the end
To be the death of me
A little piece of me
A little piece of me
A little piece of me
