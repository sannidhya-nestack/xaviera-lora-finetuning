Fill me with your words
Let me try to write my life
Fill me with your music
Let me try to write your song
Without you there's no step to take
No more dreams, just heartache
Without you time is just a tick-tock
All meaningless, life is just a lock
Hold me so I won't fall
Hold me till nightfall
Hold me
Only hear my call
Only, only hear my call
Fill me with your words
Let me try to write my life
Fill me with your music
Let me try to write you a song
Without you there's no step to take
No more dreams, just heartache
Without you time is just a tick-tock
All meaningless, life is just a lock
Hold me, so I won't fall
Hold me, till nightfall
Hold me, hold me
Hear my call
Only, only
Hear my call
