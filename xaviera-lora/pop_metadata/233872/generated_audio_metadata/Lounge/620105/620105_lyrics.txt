The way of the samurai is found in death
Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily
Every day when one's body and mind are at peace
One should meditate upon being ripped apart by arrows, rifles, spears and swords
Being carried away by surging waves
Being thrown into the midst of a great fire
Being struck by lightning
