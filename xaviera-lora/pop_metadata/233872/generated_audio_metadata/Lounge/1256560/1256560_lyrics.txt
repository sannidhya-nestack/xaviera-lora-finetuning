Walking alone in the dark, feeling sad
Cold night breeze, it's quiet now
Stars are all I can see, lonely heart
Each time echoes through my mind
Moonlit roads call me through the shadows
Find a way out of sorrow
Moonlit roads call me through the shadows
Find a way to tomorrow
Night holds me tight
Soft and cold, lost in thoughts
Dreams unfold
Hopes light starts to glow
In the dark
Maybe peace is not so far
Moonlit roads draw me through the shadows
Find a way
Out of sorrow
Moonlit roads call me through the shadows
Find a way to tomorrow
Moonlit roads call me through the shadows
Find a way out of sorrow
Moonlit roads call me through the shadows
Find a way to tomorrow
