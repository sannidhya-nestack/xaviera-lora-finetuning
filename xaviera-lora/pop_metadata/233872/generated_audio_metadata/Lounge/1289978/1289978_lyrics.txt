Watching the shadows fall
Mirror reflects our noon
Lost in a mellow dream
Under the sun's glow
Gentle whispers float
Gentle whispers float
We are here
In the calmness of the light
Where time stands still
Where time stands still
Feel the warmth surrounding
As the daylight shines bright
Floating through the silence
A peaceful embrace
Together in this space
Together in this space
We are here
In the calmness of the love
Where time stands still
Where time stands still
Reflections all around us
Clear and soft they go
In a haze of tranquil mirrors
Never loud
We are here
In the calmness of the light
Where time stands still
Where time stands still
