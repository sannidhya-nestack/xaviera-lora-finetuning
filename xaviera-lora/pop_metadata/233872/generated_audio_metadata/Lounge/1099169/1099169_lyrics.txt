I am facing all your demons
I don't know what to do, there is no reason
Try to say it, try to get it out
No I don't know if I am feeling up or down
You can't be trusted now, I know, I know
You can't be trusted now, but I know, I know
(audience laughing)
I am facing no more reason
Only hearing all of your demons
Try to change it, try to run it out
There's no way that you and I are getting out
You can't be trusted now but I know, I know
You can't be trusted now but I know, I know
