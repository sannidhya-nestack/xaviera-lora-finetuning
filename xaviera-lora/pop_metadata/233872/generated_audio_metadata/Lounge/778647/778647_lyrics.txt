Can we chase the night?
Can we chase the night?
I wanna do, wanna do
Oh yes, I wanna do, wanna do
Ooh, you got me
Ooh, you gotta hold on me
I wanna find a resolution
I wanna find the key to eternity
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Can we chase the night?
Can we chase the night?
I wanna do, wanna do
Oh yes, I wanna do, wanna do
Ooh, you got me
Ooh, you gotta hold on me
I wanna find the right solution
I wanna find the key to eternity
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Ooh, you got me
Ooh, you gotta hold on me
I wanna find a revolution
I wanna find the key to eternity
