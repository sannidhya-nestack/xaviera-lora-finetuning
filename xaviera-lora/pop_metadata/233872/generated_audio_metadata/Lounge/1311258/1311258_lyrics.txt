I see the hurt in your eyes
I feel your pain
Your smile's a clever disguise
To never take the blame
Don't leave it up to tomorrow
What you can't do today
Don't put it off'til tomorrow
And strength is in today
Never give up, keep dreaming
Never give up
Never give up on yourself
Never give up, keep dreaming
Never give up
Never give up, keep dreaming
Never give up
Never give up on yourself
Never give up, keep dreaming
Never give up
I see the hurt in your eyes
I feel your pain
Your smile's a clever disguise
To never take the blame
Don't leave it up to tomorrow
What you can't do today
Don't put it up to tomorrow
Your strength is in today
Never give up, keep dreaming
Never give up
Never give up on yourself
Never give up, keep dreaming
Never give up
