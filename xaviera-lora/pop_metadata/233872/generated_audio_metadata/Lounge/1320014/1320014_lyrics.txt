Under the velvet, moonlit sky
The stars are winking, oh so sly
Your touch ignites a whispered flame
A dance of souls, a lover's game
Your words roll smooth like honeyed wine
Each note is warm or set in line
Fingers trace the midnight blue
The world melts down to me and you
Oh sway let the groove take hold
Where hearts are young but stories old
Under rhythms, slow and true
I fall every night for the mystery of you
Your voice it hums a velvet hum
A lullaby to where we've come
The way you move a jazzy sway
Silent poetry
A night ballet, whispered secrets in the breeze
Time stands still, melting seas
Guitar strings, drum a heartbeat tune
While shadows spin beneath the moon, oh
Oh, sway, let the groove take hold
Where hearts are young but stories old
Under rhythms slow and true
I fall every night for the mystery of you
