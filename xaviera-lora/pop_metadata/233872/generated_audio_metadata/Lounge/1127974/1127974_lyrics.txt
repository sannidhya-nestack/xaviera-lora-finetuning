I'm free, yeah
I'm free
I can't be
I can't be without you
Yeah, uh, yeah, uh
In my sense of my heart, I remember
Hear sunny breeze, I can breathe without
I am free, I can't breathe without you here
Sunny breeze, I can't breathe without being here
I am free, I can't breathe without you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
La la la la la la la
Ooh, ooh
Be
