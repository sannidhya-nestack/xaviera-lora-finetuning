Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hold me in your arms
Hold
Hold me in your arms
Hold
Hold me in your arms, hold
Hold me in your arms, hold
Can you always be mine
I wish that we could be frozen in time
Before the doubts are setting in
I wish our love was frozen in time
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arm
Hold me in your arms, hold
Hold me in your arms, hold
Can you always be mine?
I wish that we could be frozen in time
Before the doubts are setting in
I wish our love was frozen in time
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Holds me in your arms
Hold
Holds me in your arms
Hold
Holds me in your arms
Oh, oh
