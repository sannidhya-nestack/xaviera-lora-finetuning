You're telling me to breathe but I can't catch a breath
You're telling me to sleep but I can't bear to rest
Running through my blood like an animal
Like an animal, like an animal
And I need to release the energy inside me
you make my world shake, I behave
Like an animal, like an animal, like an animal
Like an animal, like an animal, like an animal
My skin turns to gold when you touch me
My heart can unfold when you kiss me
I'm losing control like an animal
Like an animal, like an animal
And I need to release the energy inside me
you make my world shake, I behave
Like an animal, like an animal, like an animal
Like an animal, like an animal, like an animal
