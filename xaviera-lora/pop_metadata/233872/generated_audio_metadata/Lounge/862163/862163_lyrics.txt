This mountain's never ending
Just seems so much to push through
We'll inspire the message
We'll press on within
One foot before the other
One footprint at a time
One reason left to conquer
These roads on which we climb
Ooh, I
I'm where you are
Mm, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Who is?
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
This mountain's never ending
Just seems so much to push through
We'll inspire the message
We'll press on within
One foot before the other
One footprint at a time
One reason left to conquer
These roads on which we climb
Ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
