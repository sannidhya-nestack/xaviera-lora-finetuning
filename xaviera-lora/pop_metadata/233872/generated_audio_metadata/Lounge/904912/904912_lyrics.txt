Ooh, burn the stars
Burn, burn the stars, burn the stars
Do your thing, let the stars sound ring
Let it sing, you can do anything
Do your thing, let the stars sound ring
Let it sing, you can do anything
Burn the stars
Oh, go and burn the stars
Oh, just go and burn the stars
Let'em burn, let'em burn, let'em burn
Oh, go and burn the stars
Oh, just go and burn the stars
Let'em burn, let'em burn, let'em burn
Oh, burn the stars
Oh, burn the stars
The stars
Are just
The stars
The stars
Or just the stars
I'll be waiting for you to come back to me
