(Only one, only one, only one) (Only one, only one, only one)
I could get along so easy and so nice
If I was on my own I could live so well
I could get along so easy and so nice
If I was on my own I could live so well
A couple of acres, a pig and a cow
Want you to tell me if that is alright
A couple of acres, a pig and a cow
Just let me know if you think it is alright
A summer breeze and just you and me
Working every day just working out our dreams
It seems a long way from where we want to be
It seems so far but hey who knows who cares
It's gonna be what it's gonna be
A couple of acres a pig and a cow
Just let me know if you feel it's good anyhow
A couple of acres, a pig and a cow
I could get along with you so easy anyhow
We work every day and we've got our dreams
Me in a red dress
And you just doing what you think
We watch these things come and go
And we wonder why
Everything has its place
It just takes time
A couple of acres, a pig and a cow
You hang your head but you sure shouldn't worry
A couple of acres, a pig and a cow
It makes no difference
We got it anyhow
