Life with you so sweet, walking down the street
Laughter in the air, joy beyond compare
Lazy days we spend
Round each bend my friend
Softly time will pass
Sunshine in our breath
Lazy days we spend
Round each bend my friend
Softly time will pass
Sunshine in our grasp
Life and laughter true
Everyday with you
Under skies so blue
Hearts in perfect time
Moonlight drives at night
You and me so right
Stars above our heads
Dreams in every thread
Hold me close my dear
Whisper in my ear
Moments feel so real
In your love I heal
Hold me close my dear
Whisper in my ear
Moments feel so real
In your love I heal
Life and love turned true
Every day of you
Undisguised, so low
Heart's imperfect
