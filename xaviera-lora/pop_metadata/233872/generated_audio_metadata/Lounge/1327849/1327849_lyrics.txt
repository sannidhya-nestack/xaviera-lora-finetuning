The sun dips low, the sky turns grey
Shadows dance as light fades away
A gentle breeze whispers your name
The night begins to stake its claim
Candles flicker their golden glow
Hearts beat fast yet time moves slow
Your laughter sparkles in the air
The world dissolves when you're right there
Hold me close in this tender night
Under stars burning soft and bright
No need for words, just the rhythm of hearts
In this romance evening where magic starts
The city hums a distant tune
Yet here with you the world feels new
Your hand in mine feels so divine
This moment's ours, no sense of
Time, moonlight paints your face like art
A masterpiece that steals my heart
The night's a song we softly sing
A melody of love on silver wings
Hold me close in this tender night
Under stars
Burning soft and bright
No need for words
Just the rhythm of hearts
In this romance
Evening where magic starts
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
