Money rains down on you
You sell your sensuality
But you bow down to the way
They want you to be
Big cars are racing nowhere
And you're right to make your choices
But you're in too deep
And yet you love yourself
Too bad you won't surround
Casting out demon rays
And since you are
Live up the way
You don't have to be afraid
One day you may want to marry
Love is so extraordinary
It's just what we need for life
Oh my my my
And I hope you'll always know me
I'm always thinking of you
Too much, too young to lose the mystery
Too bad you won't surround
Casting out demon rays
And since you are
You don't have to be afraid
Truth that you won't surround
Casting out demon rage
And since you are holding on the way
You don't have to be afraid
