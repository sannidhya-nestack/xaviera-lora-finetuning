Deep beneath the song of the waves
Hidden by the seas embrace
Our love runs deep far from the shore
Like the ocean holds me tight
You hold me in your grasp
Under the waters calm
Our heartbeat just us two
The best colors are filled
Where we can grow
Love so strong like the flow of the tide
Deep beneath the song of the waves
Hidden by the seas embrace
Our love runs deep far from the shore
Like the ocean holds me tight
You hold me in your grasp
Under the waters calm
Our heartbeat just us two
The depths call us softly
But we can grow
Love so strong like the flow of the tide
Love so strong like the flow of the tide
