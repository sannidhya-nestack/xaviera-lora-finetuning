You fill me with sunny thoughts
Warm waves in my mind
Light glows in empty spots
Peace I always find
Whisper through the evening air
Calm flows with your sound
Feel you even when not there
In you I am bound
Whisper through the evening air
Calm flows with your sound
Feel you even when not there
In you I am bound
Sunshine in the night
Hold me close so tight
In this gentle light
Everything's alright
Stars shine but you out glow
Bright as morning rise
You will calm every undertow
Love in your eyes
Journey we embark
Silence sings so sweet
In your light and in the dark
Where our hearts meet
Sunshine in the night
Hold me close so tight
In this gentle light
Everything's alright
