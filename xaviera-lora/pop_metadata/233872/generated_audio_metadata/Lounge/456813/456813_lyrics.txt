Another day dawns and as my eyes cast off the night's dreams
That was or wasn't real
Dissolves in the cold air
My breath hangs like archangels above my head alone
My breath hangs like archangels above my head alone
Blood in my face, the taste on my tongue
The wind blows the song, a silent space
And birds echo its tale
Passion is all but spent
I close my eyes
And it's grotesque
Parody
The ice flows in Eden
Hamilton, the ice flows in Eden
Hamilton
I breathe thy touch, I laugh, I hurt, I see
No longer do I strike out, no longer do I bleed
I breathe thy touch, I laugh, I hurt, I see
No longer do I strike out
No longer do I bleed
The ice-flows in Eden have melted
The ice-flows in Eden have melted
