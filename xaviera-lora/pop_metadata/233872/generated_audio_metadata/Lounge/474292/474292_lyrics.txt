One alone here tonight
When you walked into the room
I fell apart, heart went boom
Got to see you now
Got to show you how
Ooh, you can trust in me
Take a chance, take it slow
Got to get it right
Don't look away, you're shine, I know
You've got to come on strong
If we're gonna get along, mmm
So trust in me
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
Wall to wall in the club
All the people getting down
It's hotting up and I'm on fire
Look into my eyes
Gonna give you my surprise
If you trust in me
Turn around can't you see
I'd follow you'round the world
And say I do and I'd be true
No fear of any flame
Really hope you feel the same
Oh oh oh
Trust in me
How won't you
How won't you
Won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you I'll want you
I'll want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
