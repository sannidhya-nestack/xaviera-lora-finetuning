Tell the end of time
Tell the end of time
We could spend a lifetime
Hiding from the rain
There can be no sunshine
But rather there is pain
Tell me you should
Tell the end of time
Till the end of time
Somewhere there's an island
We can call our own
Somewhere there's an island
We can call our own
'Til the end of time
To meet you
We can spend a lot of time
Hiding from the rain
There can be no sunshine
Where ever there is pain
Change you
To meet you
Somewhere there's an island
We can call our own
Somewhere there's an island
We can call our own
We can be together
No one else will know
To meet you
To meet you
