You're just an angel of a man
Angel of a man
You're just an angel of a man
Angel of a man
You're just an angel of a man
Angel of a man
I was born to be your everything
I was born to be your everything
I was born to be your everything
I was born to be your everything
Do you see my reflection in?
I'll be your everything
I'll be your everything
Ooh
You're just an angel of a man
Angel of a man
You're just an angel of a man
Angel of a man
You're just an angel of a man
Angel of a man
You're just an angel of a man
Angel of a man
Right up close to me like a jewel, like a diamond
I've lived a long time
I've lived a long time and I've seen snow and sun
Do you see my reflection in snow and sun?
I'm gonna be the best I can be for you, for you, for you
You're just an angel of a man
Angel of a man
You're just an angel of a man
