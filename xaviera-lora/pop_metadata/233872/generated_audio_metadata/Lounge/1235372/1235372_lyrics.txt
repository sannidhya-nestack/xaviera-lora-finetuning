We dance'til the sun rise
Your body next to mine
It's time to lose our minds
Let's play
Adopt that bad guy
But don't fall in love
Just feel my skin on your skin
Just feel my skin on your skin
Just feel my skin on your skin
We don't really care, we're partin' almost everywhere
Always wanna hear the sounds of love and atmosphere
Bite my lip and kiss my neck, we are embedded
Not like this make me et about all the tears
et about all the tears
When the morning comes
When the morning comes
I wanna feel it
I wanna feel alive
I'm in your bed, I'm yours
I'm in your bed, I'm yours
I need to hear your voice
I need to hear your voice, yeah
et about all the tears
When the morning comes
The morning comes
I wanna feel alive
I wanna feel alive
I'm in your bed, I'm yours
I'm in your bed, I'm yours
I need to hear your voice
I need to hear your voice, yeah
