It's alright, no
It's alright, no
Sad if I'm too high to look down
Maybe I'm just flying, it's all good
Like means why, no means yes, I can't hide
Peace that I cannot find
No, no, it's alright
No, no, it's alright
I'm here
Decide if I'm too high to look down
Maybe I'm just flying, it's all good
Hack means why, no means yes, I can't hide
Peace that I cannot find
No, no, it's alright
No, no, it's alright
It's alright
I'm not alone
It's alright
I'm not alone
