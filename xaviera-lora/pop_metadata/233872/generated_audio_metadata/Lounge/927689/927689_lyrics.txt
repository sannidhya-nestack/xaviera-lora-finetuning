Like a flame in the fire yeah you turn me haywire
Disappear my desire
Disappeared my desire for you
Like a flame in the fire yeah you turn me haywire
Disappeared my desire
Disappeared my desire for you
Left me at the mercy of the crowd
And I blame you'cause you let me down
My world is spinning and spinning'round
Now hear me scream and shout
Left me at the mercy of the crowd
And I blame you'cause you let me down
My world is spinning and spinning'round
Now hear me scream and shout
(whistling)
Last night I've been looking for you, I've been looking for you
Last night I've been looking for you
Last night I've been looking for you, I've been looking for you
Last night I've been looking for you
Take me to you
Like a wave in the ocean
Disappear my emotion
Will you kill my devotion
Or you kill my devotion to you
Like a wave in the ocean
Disappear my emotion
Will you kill my devotion
Or you kill my devotion to you
Like a wave in the ocean, disappear my emotions
Will you kill my devotion?
Oh, you kill my devotion, do you?
