A smokey veil on the city outskirts
The fog is rolling in
Like a kiss of a long lost lover
A taste that lingers on
In memories
Where to go, where to go, where to go from here
I don't believe that you need a friend girl
But I can be your man
And if I wake up in the morning sunshine
I don't need nobody to tell me
Where to go, where to go, where to go, where to go from here
Where to go, where to go, where to go from here?
Where to go, where to go, where to from here?
Where to go from here
