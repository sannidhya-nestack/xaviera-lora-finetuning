A summer's breeze caught in her hair
We met as if we'd wandered there
Her laughter lit a moonlit street
A rhythm found in heart's first beat
The jukebox played a scratched refrain
Our shadows tangled in the rain
Her eyes like jazz all depth and shine
Sweet syncopations became mine
First love glows like neon skies
Electric sparks inflicting tries
Our melodies a tender thread
The echoes linger though time has fled
A park bench shared the world stood still
A love unopened yet fulfilled
Her every word a smoky note
A song unspoken in her throat
Oh, young love must wane, you see
Like autumn's leaves, we'd we too must be
A fleeting spark, a tender trace
A dream in memory's soft embrace
First love glows like neon skies
Electric sparks inflate in tries
Our melody's a tender thread
The echoes linger though time has fled
A park bench shared, the world stood still
A love unopened yet fulfilled
Her every word a smoky note
A song unspoken in her throat
But all young love must wait, you see
Like autumn's leaves with wheat, you must be
A fleeting spark, a tender trace
A dream in memories, soft embrace
A dream in memories, soft embrace
