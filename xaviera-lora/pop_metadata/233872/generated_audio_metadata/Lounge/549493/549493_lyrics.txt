Layers stripped away
With nothing to display
But I'm safe within your space
Home, home, home, you are my home
Home, home, home, you are my home
I'm free
In your space (All around my home)
You erase my fears and stains into courage instead
Your embrace will melt my pain into beauty instead
Your arms, I'll stay in your arms
Your arms, I'll stay in your arms
I'm free, I'm free
Home, where I'm not home
Home, home, home where I'm not home
I'm free in your space
