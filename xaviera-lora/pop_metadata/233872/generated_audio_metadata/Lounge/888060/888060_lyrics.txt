The moon around the ocean
Heaven seems so far
Is it my reflection?
Here I am
Stars in the sky
We might be near the end
Deep in the night
Paint the sky
All our dreams run through
All the dreams run to me
Oh, the stars are out tonight
And the water gave us life
Oh, watch the sun rise
Let the light shine
Let the light shine
Set my heart on fire
Hold me in your arms
Light up my desire
Drink me'til I'm gone
Chasing stars up above
Into us
Follow me
Into love
