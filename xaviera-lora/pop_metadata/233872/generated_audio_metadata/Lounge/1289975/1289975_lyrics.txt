Healthier memories and peace in the night space
We're in a blink of, softly in each hue and gray
In this bunch of trees as we look at the space
All the foamy eyes, everything that's you, the space
How about the old memories in peace on a night they sway
In the blink of a soft fleeting human brain
Soft and foamy eyes staring at you, the space
