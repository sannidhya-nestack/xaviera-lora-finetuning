You tell me that you love me
I never thought I'd fall in love
I looked into my heart
This isn't good
But something in me
Is something I'm afraid of
Avenge me
Everything
Must fade, eventually
Everything must fade, must fade
You're everything I must be
Everything
Must be
Everything must be
Everything must fade
Everything must fade
