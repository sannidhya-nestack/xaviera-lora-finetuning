Underneath the shimmering glow of the night
The city's a canvas bathed in soft light
Shadows dance gently in their hushed ballet
While dreams tiptoe through
The evening's display
Oh, the moon whispers sweet melodies clear
Carried on breezes that drift ear to ear
Every star amuse painting skies anew
And I'm lost in the rhythm thinking of you
The final crackle, softest fallen rain
A tender reminder of joy and pain
Toe taps to a tune, slow and serene
Caught in the hazy quiet in between
Heart beats drum steady like hands on the clock
Moments like these, they're solid as rock
Time flows like jazz, unpredictable, free
Each note swaying in perfect harmony
Oh, the moon whispers sweet melodies, clear carried on breezes
That drift ear to ear
Every star a muse
Painting skies anew
And I'm lost in the rhythm
Thinking of you
Fingers trace circles
On a coffee cup's rim
While sweet saxophones croon
A low hymn
Life's little vignette
Strung on fate's string
An encore of chances, this new night's spring
Fingers trace circles on a coffee cup's rim
While sweet saxophones groom a low hymn
Life's little vignettes strung on fate's string
An encore of chances as new nights spring
