Sleepless, I don't need this
Won't somebody come and get me
Let's go, let's go already
I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna rewind that night again
I love so hard, and I don't wanna fall too fast
I just wanna ride that night again
Sleepless, I don't need this
Won't somebody come and get me? Let's go, let's go already
Sleepless, I don't need this
Won't somebody come and get me
Let's go, let's go already
I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna rewind that night again
