Sometimes I don't say the right things
Without you there is something missing
I know I can't bring you back
Even after all this time I'm still detached
You know I tried so hard to find that other woman
Oh baby, oh baby, yeah
That you told me about, oh when you left
Oh when you left, when you left
I doubt there's another one out there
Like you, oh like you, yeah
You're one of those one in a million
I don't feel quite like I used to
Nothing quite the same
I become so
You wonder how I've been dealing with this
My emotions they have been dismissed
I know you're doing just fine
But I still can't get you out of my mind
You know I tried so hard to find that other woman
Oh baby, oh baby, yeah
That you told me about, oh when you left
Oh when you left, when you left
I doubt there's another one out there
Like you, oh like you, yeah
You're one of those
One in a million
I don't feel quite like I used to
Nothing's quite the same
You're one of those
You're one of those
One in a million
I don't feel quite like I used to
Nothing's quite the same
I'm at a loss of what I should do
I've become so numb
