Lately I've been contemplating
Every decision I've ever made
I know there's no right time to say this
I don't think you're the one for me
Dizzy spinning
Sometimes it's too much
Take it easy
There's no need to rush
Is it all in my head?
Or is it all in my mind?
Comparisons
Am I wasting my time?
Trapped myself in this cage
I need help getting out
I did this to myself and I'll make my way out
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Is it all in my head? Or is it all in my mind?
Comparisons, am I wasting my time?
Trapped myself in this cage, I need help getting out
I did this to myself and I'll make my way out
