Two hearts that are broken and broken in two
Two minds that are so messed up
Don't know what to do
Yeah, my soul, deep in my soul, it aches for you
Deep in my soul, breathing exposed
Deep in my soul, so let me lay this for you
Deep in my soul it aches for you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hear my soul, it moves for you
And in my heart, you hear my voice calling
Two hearts that are broken
And broken in two
Two minds that are so messed up
Don't know what to do
Yeah my soul
Deep in my soul it aches for you
Leaving my scars for a new age for you
