I connect you to the network
And to break ties with me
I connect you to the network
And to break ties with me
And I just, and I just, and I just, and I just (repeated)
(audience applauding)
I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone,
I connect you to the network skyhead
I'm prepared to be alone
Let you break ties with all the people you know
I connect you to the network skyhead
I'm prepared to be alone
Let you break ties with all
Stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me
Stop me, stop me, stop me, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
(I'm falling down)
(I'm falling down)
