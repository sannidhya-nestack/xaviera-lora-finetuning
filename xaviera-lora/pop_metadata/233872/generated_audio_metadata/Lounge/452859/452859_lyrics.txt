December, defense, you unfold in front of me
You shed a tear
And we let go of what seemed to be
Then follow the whispers that call to you
Then follow the whispers
That call to you
Follow the whispers
That call to you
Follow the whispers
That call, that call to you
Untangle ourselves from protection
In a rush of beauty to a deep joy
Penetrate the mystery
Fall into surrender and open doors
Then follow the whispers that call to you
Then follow the whispers that call to you
Follow the whispers
That call to you
Then follow the whispers
That call, that call to you
We can't control what happens
We can't control where it will go
We can't worry'bout how it comes
Just open doors
Then follow the whispers
That call to you
Then follow the whispers that call to you
Follow the whispers that call to you
Then follow the whispers that call, that call
Until you can't go, I'll stay
