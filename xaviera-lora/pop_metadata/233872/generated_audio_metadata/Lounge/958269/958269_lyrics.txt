Trembling, air feels like October skies
Fumbling
Lost all track of space and time
And I know how things must seem
So fragile in our shells
And it's not so binary
How we journey to ourselves
Pause myself
Hold my breath before I die
A jellyfish beneath the surface
The sparks that make us dry
And I see the never ending shoreline
But now I'm not alone
It's funny how sometimes
We need to lose our way to find our home
I can't tell
I feel it
I'm sure
So how can I help watching the clouds pass through
No clue of the time, no reason to be so due
We all know the sky is for the first time
They draw the lines just right in between
I'm chasing you
I'm chasing you
I'm chasing you
I'm chasing you
I'm chasing you
