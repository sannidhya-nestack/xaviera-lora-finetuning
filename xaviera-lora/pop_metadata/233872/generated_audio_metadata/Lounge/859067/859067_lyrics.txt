I'm just a shadow of you
I'm just a shadow of you
I'm just a shadow of you
I'm just a shadow of you
I'm just a shadow
I'm just a shadow
It's like there's shade in my heart
It's like there's shade in my heart
Just close my heart today
I'll leave it in your eyes
That leaving it's okay
And I'm just saying goodbye
Say goodbye
I'll say goodbye
You're the shade, you're the shade of my heart
You're the shade, you're the shade in my heart
Shadow, I'm just a shadow of you
Shadow, I'm just a shadow of you
Shadow, I'm just a shadow of you
Shadow, I'm just a shadow of you
Shadow, I'm just a shadow
Shadow, I'm just a shadow
Shadow
