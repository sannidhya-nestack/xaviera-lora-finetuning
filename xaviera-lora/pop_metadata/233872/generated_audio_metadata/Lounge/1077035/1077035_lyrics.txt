Can I be your star tonight
You filled my soul with light the day we met
I don't wanna leave your side, no
Have me by your side when the sun sets
I hope you'll still want me
I hope you'll still need me a million years from now
The seasons are changing
The nights ever fading
It's time we left the ground
Let's leave for an eternity
We'll sail across the lights beyond the sky
I'll be with you eternally
I'm an addict for your love
It keeps me high
Keeps me high
Keeps me high
Keeps me high
I hope you'll still want me
I hope you'll still need me
A million years from now
The seasons are changing
The night's ever fading
It's time we left the ground
Let's leave for an eternity
We'll sail across the lights beyond the sky
I'll be with you eternally
I'm an addict for your love
It keeps me high
Keeps me high
We'll sail across the lights beyond the sky
I'll be with you eternally
I'm an addict for your love
It keeps me high, keeps me high
Keeps me high
