Moonlight on the ocean
Whispers in the dark
You and me together
Fire in our hearts
Stars above us shining
Softly sharing glow
You are all I wanted
More than you could know
Sweet dreams my love
I will fly in your arms so tight
Sweet dreams, mine and love
Silent night embraces every single sigh
Love so strong I'm chained underneath the sky
Moments feel like magic
When you're by my side
Hand in hand forever
On this dreamy ride
Sweet dreams my love
In the night we'll fly
In your arms so tight
Sweet dreams, my love
