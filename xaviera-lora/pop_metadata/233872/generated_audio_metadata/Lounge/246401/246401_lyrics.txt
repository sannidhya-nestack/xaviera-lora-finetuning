Feeling alone
I feel alone
And when you're alone get somebody
Somebody in case you feel the beat get in motion
And when you're lonesome get yourself
You take care, you feel the deep red emotion
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da, hey-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, da-da-da-da-da-da, hey-ya
Hey ya
Wondering what we have done
Till dawn has come
Time has disappeared in your smile
How long for a while
Now the wind has turned into storm
I'm feeling alone
Still feeling alone, yeah
And when you're alone, get somebody, somebody who cares
You feel the beat, get emotion
And when you're lonesome, get yourself, you take care
You feel the beat, get emotion
And when you're alone, get somebody, somebody who cares
You'll feel the beat get in motion
And when you're lonesome, get yourself, you'll take care
You'll feel the beat get in motion
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (da-da-da-da-da-da-dum-dum-dum-dum-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da)
