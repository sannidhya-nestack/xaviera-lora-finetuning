Instinct within a imagery on our species
Instinct is inextricably bound to unreasoning impulses, and today we clearly see its true nature.
Instinct has just become aware of its irrelevance, and like a cornered beast,
it will not go down without a bloody fight.
All night long in the street
And the girls all like me
And the say come to church song
Monsignor we gonna rock star
Nobody go boss nobody go beat me
Nobody gonna kill you, I know it to the teeth
I'll hand them down, the children be free once I'm gone
Oh, baby
Thank you for your right concern
Of course your question
Patches on one of the basic biological impulses
With all its associated hopes and fears for the future species
Help ensure that humanity's trust in you is not misguided
