People all they hate
They are always thinking
I am like a guest
In this world
On and on
I am not their slave
Person anymore
I live everyday
At the last
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on
Come on, take my hand
Come on, I'm your friend
And now, I will sing the song
On and on
Come on, take my hand
Come on, I'm your friend
And now I will sing this song on and on
I will sing the song no need for
