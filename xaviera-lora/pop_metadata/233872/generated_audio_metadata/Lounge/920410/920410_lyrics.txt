I'm always dreaming about you
Searching for you in my sleep
I cannot move apart from you
I need you
Still if a day goes by when
I don't see you smile I fall apart
It makes me crazy
Still if a night goes by when
I don't feel you breathing next to me
I am utterly heart sick
Heart sick
Let's say you're away for a whole day
I pace the room like a fool
My favorite colors turn dark gray
I need you
Still if a day goes by when
I don't see you smile I fall apart
It makes me crazy
Still if a night goes by when
I don't feel you breathing next to me
I am utterly
Heartache, oh heartache
Hold me longer
'Cause it makes me stronger for you
Still if a day goes by when
I don't see you smile, I fall apart
It makes me crazy
Still if a night goes by
I don't feel you breathing next to me
I am utterly heart sick
Oh, heartache
