Baby, you let me in, then you push me out
Now I'm falling down, I'm falling down
You and your crazy love
You make me weak
Baby I'm falling down
I'm falling down
Let's run away just you and I
You and I
Now I'm falling, falling
Let's make mistakes, just you and I
Your heart is mine
And I'm falling, falling down
Down
And I'm falling, falling down
Down
And I'm falling, falling down
Baby you let me in
Then you push me out
Now I'm falling down
I'm falling down
You and your crazy love
You make me weak
Baby I'm falling down
I'm falling down
Let's run away just you and I
You and I
Now I'm falling, falling
Let's make mistakes, just you and I
Your heart is mine
And I'm falling, falling down
Down
And I'm falling, falling down
Down
And I'm falling, falling down
