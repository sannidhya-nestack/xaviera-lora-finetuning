I'm holding on
As time goes by
I keep holding on
But I can't let it show
So hard I tried
For so long
So hard I cried
For so long
Shame to even let you see, you still have a place in me
Shame to even let it show that I can't let it go
All this time you're on my mind
I feel so tied to you
And though I try so hard to prove
I'm never over you now
Shame to even let you see
Used to love a piece of me
Shame to even let it show
That I can't let it go
Shame to even let you see
Used to love a piece of me
I seem to even let it show
That I can't let it go
I'm holding on
I'm holding on
I'm holding on
I'm holding on
I'm holding on
I'm holding on
I'm holding on
I'm holding on
