It's too much
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I, I can't help myself
I always find it harder to breathe
When you stay close to me
It's too much, I can't help myself
Trying to save my breath in this moment
The way that you look at me
I can't help myself
It's too much
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I, I can't help myself
It's too much
