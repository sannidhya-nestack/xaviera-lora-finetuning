Beneath the glow of candlelight serenade
The path we're tracing, the choices we've made
The stars and their dance tell tales of design
Whispering secrets, your soul echoes mine
Oh destiny, is it chance or a plan?
A melody weaving through this woman and man
The rhythm of fate plays deep in my chest
With you by my side, I follow the quest
The clock keeps on ticking yet it feels still
Each moment eternal, rich and fulfilled
Your touch is a guide, the map of my heart
As sure as the moon pulls the tides apart
Strings hum a song both tender and warm
Love's gentle tempest, a quiet storm
A beat strong and steady as life's pulse goes
You and I together, the river flows
The echoes of jazz in the night softly play
Their whispers alive, the stars on our way
Romance soaring high, hearts take to the skies
Our souls interwoven, no room for disguise
Oh, destiny is a chance or a plan
A melody weaving through this woman and man
The rhythm of fate plays deep in my chest
With you by my side, I follow the quest
