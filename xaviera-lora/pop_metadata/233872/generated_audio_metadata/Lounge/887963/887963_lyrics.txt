I'm not just another lover
A body to discover
I can take away the suffer
Your body feels
And I've got rhythm you can thumb
I've got strings you can strum
Play your heart like a drum
I'll play your heart like a drum
Play your heart like a drum
Play your heart like a drum
Play your heart like a drum beat, drum beat
Play your heart like a drum
Play your heart like a drum
Play your heart like a drum beat, drum beat
I'm not saying that it's easy
They'll hold me down and squeeze me
But I want to feel you breathing onto me
And I've got rhythm you can thumb
I've got strings you can strum
Play your heart like a drum
I'll play your heart like a drum
You're just another lover, a body to discover
I won't look another up and down
You're just another lover, a body to discover
I won't look another up and down
Play your heart like a drum
Play your heart like a drum
Play your heart like a drumbeat, drumbeat
Play your heart like a drum, play your heart like a drum
Play your heart like a drum beat, drum beat
And I've got rhythm you can thumb
I've got strings you can strum
Play your heart like a drum
I'll play your heart like a drum
Play your heart like a drum
Play your heart like a drum
Play your heart like a drum beat, drum beat
Play your heart like a drum
Play your heart like a drum
Play your heart like a drum beat, drum beat
