Hmm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
When the storm of love, when the storm of love
And the star of love
And the star of love
You
And the stars above
And the stars above
You and me
And the stars above
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die
(I don't know how to love you)
(I don't know how to love you)
(I don't know how to love you)
(I don't know how to love you)
