I'm drowning in this grey serum
no one saved me
I'm on my own here, yeah
Tears are falling on my cigarette
And no one can hear me
And you let me down so
I can call you what I need, yeah
Babe, I won't fall back into the same thing
I just lived this
I want a healing
Please don't hurt my feelings, yeah
Hell, baby, I won't fall in into the same thing
I just like this, I want a healing
Please don't hurt my feelings, yeah
Please don't hurt my feelings, yeah
Please don't hurt my feelings, yeah
Baby you, baby you are a monster, are a monster
Baby you, baby you will leave me again, leave me again
Baby you, baby you are a monster, are monster
Baby you, baby you will leave me again, leave me again
Will leave me again, leave me again
Will leave me again, leave me again
