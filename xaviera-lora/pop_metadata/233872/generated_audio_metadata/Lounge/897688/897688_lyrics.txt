(Humming)
We flow through mountain tops
We grow now we won't stop
Face that out of breath
So close almost see the morning lights
Sun is out we will be fine
So why won't we take time
So why won't we take some time now
To listen carefully and rewind
It feels good on me
Rewind and rewind
And rewind and rewind yeah
To listen carefully and rewind
It feels good on me
Rewind and rewind
And rewind and rewind yeah
(Outro)
The beat is taking over, can we find some closure?
Why won't we take time, take time, take time
See the morning light
Soon it's out we will be fine
So why won't we take time, take time, take time
Why won't we take time, take time
To listen carefully and rewind
It feels good when we rewind and rewind and rewind and rewind yeah
To listen carefully and rewind
It feels good when we rewind and rewind and rewind and rewind yeah
To listen carefully and rewind
It feels good on me, rewind, rewind, rewind, rewind, yeah
To listen carefully and rewind
It feels good on me, rewind, rewind, rewind, rewind, yeah
