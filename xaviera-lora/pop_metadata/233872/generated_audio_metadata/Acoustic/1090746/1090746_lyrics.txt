To your inspirations, oh no
To your dreams, oh no
To your inspirations, oh no
To your dreams
You never gave much thought
To where you'd be now
And now that you're here
You want out
You bet yourself and to hold
You bet yourself and to hold
You bet yourself and to hold
And I, I, I, I, I, I, I
They believe that it's you
Hold on to your inspirations
Hold on to your dreams
Hold on to your inspirations
Hold on
To your dreams
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
