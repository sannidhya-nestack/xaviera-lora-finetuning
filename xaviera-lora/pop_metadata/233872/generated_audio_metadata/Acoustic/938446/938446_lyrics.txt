Witches burn and turn the tables on me
I would run if I could find my feet
Slowly I will cut her to the quick
She burns her dresses and I pick up the sticks
Now I'm drowning in a sea of magic
She draws me to her like a magnet
I'm just another spell down in her cellar
Every day is Halloween with her
Never endingly
I'll love you always
With my finite short fuse
She's got my heart and caffeine in a cauldron
I'm swimming in her soup
Now I'm drowning in a sea of magic
She draws me to her like a magnet
I'm just another spell down in her cellar
Every day is Halloween with her
Now I'm drowning in a sea of magic
She draws me to her like a magnet
I'm just another spell down in her cellar
Every day is Halloween
Every day is Halloween
Every day is Halloween
Every day is Halloween with her
