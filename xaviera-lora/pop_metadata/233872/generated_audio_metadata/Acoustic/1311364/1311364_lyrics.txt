Hope is a friend you can always count on
When you're feeling down again
Hope always has a song where there is hope
You can find a way, you just gotta believe
That today's gonna be a better day
Hope, hope is a voice that's always ringing out
It helps you make a choice
To learn what life's about
Where there is hope
You can find a way
You just gotta believe
That today's gonna be
A better day
Hope always believes
Always stays
Always loves
Makes it all okay
Where there is hope
You can find a way
You just gotta believe
That today's gonna be
A better day
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hope always believes
Always stays
Always loves
Makes it all okay
Where there is hope, you can find a way
You just gotta believe, that today's gonna be a better day
