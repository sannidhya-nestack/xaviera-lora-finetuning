Be true to myself, be true to my soul
But these lines on my face
Is the truth I bear today
If I had my way
These lines on my face
Wouldn't matter at all
If I had my way, I'd et all my fears and let myself fall
If I had my way, I'd write a hit song
I'd quit my day job, live off champagne and love
Be true to my love
Be true to myself
Be true to my soul
But these lines on my face
Is the truth I bear today
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
