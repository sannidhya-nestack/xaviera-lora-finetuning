Way down in Jodah, there's a woman
Beautiful as night, eyes full of light
She got warmth in her breath and love in her chest she sings
I just wanna be your friend
We're all heading towards the same end
I just wanna be your friend
We're all heading towards the same end
Way down in Florida
There's a man
He's got a beer in his hand
Feet in the sand
He's got oil on his skin
He's wearing a big brand
He says
I just wanna be your friend
We're ahead, then top the same end
I just wanna be your friend
We're ahead, then top the same end
Way down in Alabama
There's a band
They got that beat in their feet
Rhythm from the street
They got smiles on their faces
They know they're going places
They're singing
I just wanna be your friend
We're all heading towards the same end
I just wanna be your friend
We're all heading towards the same end
