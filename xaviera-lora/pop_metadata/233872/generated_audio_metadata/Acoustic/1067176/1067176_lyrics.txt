I've spent most of my life trying to be
Who I thought everyone else wanted me to be
The only way I can be truly free, free
Is to finally be true to me, me
I will never know what's on the inside
If I never give myself a chance to shine
I will never know what's on the inside
If I never give myself a chance to shine
I ask you to guide me, show me which way to go
And when I reach my destination, I believe you'll let me know
There's something in me that's wanting more, more
But I have to give myself a chance to explore
I will never know what's on the inside
If I never give myself a chance to shine
I will never know what's on the inside
If I never give myself a chance to shine
Just go on and shine
Go on and shine
Just go on and shine
Just go on and shine
Go on and shine
Just go on and shine
I will never know what's on the inside
If I never give myself a chance to shine
I will never know what's on the inside
If I never give myself a chance to shine
Just go on and shine
