I don't wanna tell you that I miss you
if you've been swimmingly
It's gonna do a number on me
I don't wanna tell you
That I need you
if you've got nothing but lead
It's gonna do another on me
No need to come around your door
If you don't need me anymore
No need to dig
Discuss what we were
When you know how you feel
Yeah, you're so sure
I don't wanna write you
How I'm feeling
If they're just empty words
That you won't be reading
And I don't wanna walk on
If I'm the only one
If I'm the only one
No need to come around your door
If you don't need me anymore
No need to deep
Scars what we were
When you know how you feel
Yeah you're so sure
Yeah you're so sure sure
You're so sure sure
You're so sure sure
You're so sure sure
Yeah you're so sure sure
You're so sure sure
You're so sure sure
Yeah you're so sure
