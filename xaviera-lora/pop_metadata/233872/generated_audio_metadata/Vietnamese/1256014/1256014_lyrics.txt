As they march ever random, as they walk straight
But they bring hope, and they bring spring again
For when we do all we need, the world will be right there
Let's keep our breath in, our mouth open tight
We don't walk with our knees, we dance like a breeze
Settle at the trees, gather your arms under knees
Keep up in our wings, gather stars where they cease
We don't walk with our knees, we spin round the place
(I don't fall in the land of the water, it's miracle)
(We don't fall, we don't miss, we dance like the breeze)
(Sands of life, the trees count the walls on their knees)
(People feed our race, yet the silence never ceases)
(We don't fall, we don't miss)
(We stay in last place)
In this camp again, we got nothing to fear
We don't want to break no peace
Feel it rise like a breeze
And all of the trees
Can't support us on their knees
We don't want to break no peace
Let the sun never cease
We don't want to break no peace
Please, we don't want to break no peace
The waves of storms resonate
In the heart of the culture
We never gave up
We don't want to break no peace
Please, let it go
