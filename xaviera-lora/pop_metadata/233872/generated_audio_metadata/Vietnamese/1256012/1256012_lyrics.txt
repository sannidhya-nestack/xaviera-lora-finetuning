Yeah, I hail from a place far east side
Vietnam where the sun and culture coincide
Born into the rhythm, the beat and our stride
In a country vibrant, in traditions we abide
In a labyrinth of streets, Saigon where I reside
In our movement, the history of wars we hide
Hip hop is my language, in lyrics we can fly
Through the mic we voice
Our tales worldwide
Vietnam to the world
Hip hop heals our stories
Our struggles it reveals
Word by word it strikes
It appeals in this universal language
Our truth it unseals
Vietnam to the world
Hip hop heals our stories
Our struggles it reveals
Word by word it strikes
It appeals in this universal language
Our truth it unseals
Hear your words flow like the Mekong, strong and free
Painting a picture of Vietnam for the world to see
From the terrace hills of Saba to the South China Sea
We are the Vietnamese dream, hip-hop our decree
With the mic in our hand, encouraging our spree
We are the voice of Vietnam, loud and spree
Through the hip-hop beat, we claim our place
Stand up, rise together in unity
We forsake Vietnam to the world
Hip Hop heals our stories our struggles it reveals
Word by word it strikes it appeals
In this universal language our truth it unseals
Vietnam to the world
Hip Hop heals our stories our struggles it reveals
Word by word it strikes it appeals
In this universal language our truth it unseals
Vietnam to the world
Hip Hop heals our stories our struggles it reveals
Word by word it strikes it appeals
In this universal language our truth it unseals
Yeah, this is Vietnamese hip-hop making our deal
In the world's grand stage our presence we seal
Vietnam to the world our spirit real
Through lyrics and beats our souls we reveal
Yeah, this is Vietnamese hip-hop making our deal
This is Vietnamese hip hop making our deal
In the world's grand stage
Our presence we seal
Vietnam to the world
Yeah
Yeah, Vietnam to the world, hip-hop heals
Our stories, our struggles, it reveals
Word by word, it strikes, it appeals
In this universal language, our truth, it unseals
