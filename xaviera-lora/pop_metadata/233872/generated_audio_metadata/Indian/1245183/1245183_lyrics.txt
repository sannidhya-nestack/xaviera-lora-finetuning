फेरी मुझ से कानमे है जादू
क्लेचे केंगे स्माल
Your eyes, they shine so bright
ते पिनन्जी ना मुश्यकिल है
Life's hard without you
You light up my darkest night
सितारें जैसी जंपे तू
You shine a star in the sky so blue
They all should make love to the old man
And I lose myself
Dreams come alive with you
Be true, be by them
just your words are sweet as honey
You make my world so fine
Days are dead, dead in cars
With you around every day
Special memories in my mind
Fittan en jessi, can't look at you
We shine a star in the sky so blue
Deri och syngli konta om en
If I lose myself, dreams come alive here
Every night with you, without you
When I'm dead, it feels like a lonely dream
You and me, it's all my heart
Together, we're a perfect team
Sit tight and just jump, it don't matter if we're a team
Sit tight and just sit, jump, get through
You shine like a star in the sky so blue
The ocean may come down on me (I can't be right with myself)
Dreams come alive with you
Sit down in your chair, sit down in your door
