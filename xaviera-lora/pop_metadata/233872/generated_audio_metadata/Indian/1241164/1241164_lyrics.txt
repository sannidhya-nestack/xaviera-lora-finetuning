In the game of love just two of us
We're dancing to a rhythm deep in trust
You and me we're like a symphony
Our souls entwined this is destiny
Every step we take makes our love grow
Singing melodies that only we know
You are my light, my guiding star
No matter how far, we'll never be apart
Hold me close and let's intertwine
Our hearts beating perfect rhyme
On this journey
Together we'll go
Love's the path that we both know
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Together we'll go off a path, a path that we both know
Nunchekale laka omilalo
Hamare te loko sahitala me kareganeto
Nisaa ham sa te chelenge
Yare kiyaa
Your home, don't know what time they're at
