In the city streets, she's a sight to behold
A style queen with a heart of gold
From head to toe, she's a fashion dream
In her world everything gleams and gleams
She's a style queen ruling with grace
Every step she takes she leaves a trace
With her fashion sense she sets the scene
In her presence everyone feels like a queen
Jeans ki tuti pe
Purti ki simaye usne sochi
Bana hi nahi duniya
Karmiyon me chhata, sardiyon me chhata
Dada dada dada dila di uski akni dukaana
Staryki domy, uski džale, fałosa, džiniki, suce, sestocku, šemiljana
Vešniki domy, žamotnievo, začišališteš, vešnitnievo
