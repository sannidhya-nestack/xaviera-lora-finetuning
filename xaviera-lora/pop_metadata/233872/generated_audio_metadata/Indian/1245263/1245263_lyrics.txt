What's the matter?
가져놔도 (I'm still in your smile)
And your eyes they shine so bright
들이대는지 너무 시클해 (My life's hard without you)
You light up my darkest night
से तारे जैसी चमके तू (She'll shine like a star)
In the sky so blue
तेरी रोशनी में को जाना (And I lose myself)
Dreams come alive with you
Tini papi hemi kasa
Sweet as honey
You make my world so fine
This ahti hehi din kasa
You're my reason, my rhyme
Seems very nice, the night rhyme
Sit down and just sit, don't get up (you shine)
In the rush of evening, caught down all night (and I lose myself)
Dreams come alive again
Te di pate, heli kasa, sweet as honey
You make my world go so fine
This is such a heaven, every night without you (I can't get out, I can't get out)
Feels like a lonely dream
Tu he meri subaki, don't you (You are my lonely line)
Together we're a perfect team
