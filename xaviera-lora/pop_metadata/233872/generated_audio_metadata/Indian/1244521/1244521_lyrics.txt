देरे नस्वी कियों में दिल का खाब है
आँकों में देरी बातों का ज्यादो है
Close to you my heart dreams anew
In your eyes the magic of your words
Blues, blues
चाहता हूँ मैं तुझे कोले दिल के राजे
इतने जर में संदेगी का सफर बढा
हसी है है
Want to show you the secrets of my heart
In one glance life's journey looks so beautiful
Just dance once with me under the stars so bright
Let our souls entwine in this moment's light
But they don't let the guilty put their heads down, it isn't dirty, they don't stop
What you feel but fear is overflow, you're my life, your path I wanna follow
Sublimations are done, they have all been paid
I am what's done, she ain't got a shot set
I decorate changes, memories of you
There are two mouths to your every smile
There is a feeling closely to you
Just dance once with me under the stars so bright
Let our souls be fine in this moment's light
In the rhythm of our hearts
Let love ignite
Tonight's our chance to make everything right
It's in a weird time, rhythm of our hearts
Let love ignite
Tonight's our chance to make everything right, oh
De na sa kiki o ho me nga hako sa le
Close to you my heart dreams anew
It can rise and magic goes through
Shantabhoo hai tu simko le dheel ke laa
Sing a sad and sing because I've learned words since I've seen it
I was sure to see it somehow
In the moment's last journey looks so beautiful
Just dance once with me under the stars so bright
Let our souls survive in this moment's light
In the rhythm of our hearts
Let love ignite tonight's our chance to make everything
