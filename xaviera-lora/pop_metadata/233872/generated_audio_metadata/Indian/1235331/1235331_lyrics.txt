Doorbeats and chants are playing loud and clear (loud and clear)
Waiting bells are ringing in a joyous atmosphere (ooh yeah)
Stages set the lights up bright, the crowd is filled with cheer (hey, hey)
Welcome to the wedding, let's dance and spread the cheer (let's spread the cheer)
The bride she enters with a smile upon her face (a smile upon her face)
The crew is waiting, heart beating at a fast pace (fast pace)
The love so pure shines in every embrace (embrace)
Now let's sing and dance like celebrating greats (celebrating greats)
Shaadi wali raat rai sab hai tum tere maa
गोड़ो शेन जाय, ग्यास वो तेराज करे
फिर के हम सबको साय, चश्चन है यहां
शारी वानी रात में, let's celebrate साथ में
