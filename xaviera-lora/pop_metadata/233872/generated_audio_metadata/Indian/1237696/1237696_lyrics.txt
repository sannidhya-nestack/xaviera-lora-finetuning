Lost in your eyes, I can't deny
The way you make me feel is so high
Heartbeat racing, my mind's in a haze
Caught in a love can't escape disgrace
You got me helpless, don't even know why
Your touch is like fire, I can't deny
Every word you say cuts so deep
I've fallen deeper into your spell, so sweet
Dil tera diwala, I'm under your control
Iska hai aisa, mujh pe hai jo nobara
Du ber att i farna om helplessness in this love
Deka me, du er mina kålgransara
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Every word you say, it cuts so deep
I'm falling deeper into your spell, so sweet
दू तेरा दी फाला
I'm under your control
इसका है आसार
मुझ पे है जो नों बारा
Du ber att ifana
I'm helpless in this love
Deka me
Du er mina ogar asara
