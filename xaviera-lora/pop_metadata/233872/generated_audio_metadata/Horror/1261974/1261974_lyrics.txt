In the deep of the night, when shadows grow long
Under the moon's haunted light, begins our song
Sounds of whispers carried by the chilled wind
In this eerie night, where miracles or curses are pinned
In this realm of darkness under the Halloween's moon
You know what is safe, the haunting will start soon
The lost spirits wander with whispers they moan
In your spooky Halloween night you're never really alone
You're never really alone
Pumpkins with faces grinning with a ghastly sight
Black cats crossing in this magical night
Echoes of owls, they're chilling him in this dark
Tale where the light is dim
This is his Halloween
Spectral celebration
A time for the spirits
A ghostly convocation
Shadows dancing in moon's eerie glow
Lost in time in darkness they flow
As the clock strikes midnight
The haunting begins in this dark
Ambience where darkness always wins
This is Halloween, a night of spectral cheer
Where every shadow whispers, beware I am near
