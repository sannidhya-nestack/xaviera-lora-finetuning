Ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ah
Ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ah
Pumpkins blow, the night is new
Ghosts go boo and witches fly
Bats are swirling through the sky
Candles flicker, shadows play
Halloween is here today
Spooky night of trick or treat (Halloween, Halloween)
Sing it loud, stomp your feet
Candies sweet and pumpkins bright
Monsters laughing through the night
Doors go creak and owls go "woah"
Halloween belongs to you
Boo-wee
Happy Halloween to you
