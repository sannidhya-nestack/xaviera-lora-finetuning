In the heart of the darkness when the moon's shining bright
Witches, ghosts and goblins dance in the night
The pumpkins are smiling with their eerie delight
It's Halloween night and the thrill is in sight
Halloween, Halloween full of fright and fun
Little monsters knocking trick or treat they've begun
Costumes in colors of every kind
Halloween, Halloween, let's see what we find
Spooky tales are whispered in the autumn air
Haunted houses, black cats, surprises everywhere
Skeletons rattling and bats in their flight
It's Halloween night, full of delight and fright
Halloween, Halloween under the moon's soft light
Jack-o'-lanterns glowing, offering a spooky sight
Shadows running from our fears
Halloween, Halloween
The magical night is here
As the night ends with echoes of laughter and song
Halloween, Halloween
The memories will last
