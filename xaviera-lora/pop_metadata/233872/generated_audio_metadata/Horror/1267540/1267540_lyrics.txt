In the love shabbat's pick, the Torah's secret scheme
Where the witch's house was made, on this hot and pot so gay
Was how beneath the air was grazed, there were looms their way
Through the thick and riskless hush, to the glowstone where they rushed
True knock knock, the door creaked wide
Darkened hall where spirits glide
Cackling laughter, echoes clear
A festive night filled with fear
Candles flicker, pumpkins grin
Black cats prowl a chilling din
Bubbling cauldrons, potions brew
Witches' house had eerie clues
Ghouls and goblins dance around as skeletons rise from the ground
Spider webs and ghostly haze caught in this Akama maze
You will dream the children cry but the witches gaze despite
Promises of sweets galore lead them further through the door
In the attic shadows play where the witches magic sways
One by one they take their seat captured by the smell so sweet
Oh the night is stretches long horror meets explosion
He saw haunted trees'til morning light
In the witch's house that night
Talk knock, the door creaked wide
Dark in the hall where spirits fly
Can't play the lute, the red door's clear
Off the set night
With fear was coming, we knew the echo was great
Children did but lost their way
Through the thicket, whispers hushed
Tip the doors, the burning rushed
Knock knock, the door creaks wide
Darkened hall, where spirits glide
Cackling laughter, it goes clear
A festive knock, with gladdened hall
Where spirits glide
Darkened hall, where spirits glide
Cackling laughter, it goes clear
Cackling laughter, it goes clear
Cackling laughter, with fear
