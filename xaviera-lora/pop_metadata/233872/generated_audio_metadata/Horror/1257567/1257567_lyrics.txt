Freaking shadows in the night
Underneath the pale moonlight
Sticky whispers, children's fright
On this special Halloween night
Halloween, Halloween
A night of fright, a night unseen
Tricks and treats, ghosts in the scene
Welcome to the night of Halloween
Jack-o'-lanterns glowing bright
Witches flying in the night
Ghoulish laughter echoes right
In the chilling mist of Halloween's night
Halloween, Halloween
Ghouls and goblins all the scene
Chills and thrill behind the screen
This is the night of Halloween
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mm
As the midnight bell rings clear, keep your loved ones very near
Prepare to face your darkest fear on the haunting night of Halloween
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
