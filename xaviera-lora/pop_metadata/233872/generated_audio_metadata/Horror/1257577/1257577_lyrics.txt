In the crisp of the autumn, under moons so bright
Walking through the shadows, in the Halloween night
Giggles, shrieks, and whispers through the air
Trick or treat is the credo, scare if you dare
Halloween, Halloween, a night so magical
Castles and candy, the atmosphere's whimsical
Pumpkins playing wild, their eyes aflame
Halloween, Halloween, it's not just a game
Spiders sting their webs, and bats take flight
Ghouls and goblins join us in the pale moonlight
Creeping through the darkness, seeking the thrill
Halloween, Halloween, time for a chill
Halloween, Halloween, so full of mystery
Under the enchanted moon, we rewrite history
In the masquerade
Spirits come alive
Halloween, Halloween
It's time to fly
As the dawn slips in
And Halloween takes flight
We'll dream of this enchantment
Wrapped in the night
The masks are put away
The whispers are gone
Until Halloween returns
With a new mysterious dawn
Spiders sting their webs, and bats take flight
Ghouls and goblins join us in the pale moonlight
Creeping through the darkness, seeking a thrill
Halloween, Halloween, time for a chill
Halloween, Halloween, so full of mystery
Under the enchanting moon, we rewrite history
In the masquerade
Spirits come alive, Halloween, Halloween, it's time to fly
As the dawn slips in and Halloween takes flight
We'll dream of this enchantment wrapped in the night
The masks are put away, the whispers are gone
Until Halloween returns with the new
