In the still of the night, whispers rise
Shadows dance in the flickering light
A chilling wind howls, an eerie delight
On the veiled stage, spectres take flight
Under a moonless sky, the enchantment begins
Haunted echoes, they tell of unseen sins
In this grand theater of darkness and fears
The night simply leads to the grave, it sings
Spirouettes in the macabre lay
To the silent opera the phantoms sway
In the ancient halls secrets lay
Guarded by ghouls who've lost their way
In the heart of the night, the haunting thrives
A spectral waltz as the darkness arrives
This is the sonata of the twilight's chives
The chorus of spirits in their afterlives
Under a moonless sky, the enchantment begins
Haunted echoes, they tell of unseen sins
In this grand theus, in the echo of the dusk
The terror creeps under the moonless sky
The enchantment begins
Haunted echoes, they tell of unseen sins
In this grand theater of darkness and fears
The night symphony to the brave it sings
Silhouettes, pirouettes, in the macabre ballet
To the silent of the love phantom sway
In the ancient halls secrets lay
Guarded by goons who've lost their way
It's in the league to the brave it sings
In the heart of the night, the haunting thrives
A spectral wall says the darkness arrives
Within ancient halls secrets lay
But it bites, that once felt the night
Eerie strange
In the heart it falls on the twilight stage
And the dark orchestra concludes its rage
Remember these melodies of a haunting age
That once felt the night
Eerie strange
