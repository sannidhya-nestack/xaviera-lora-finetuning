Deep in the hollow where the darksiders grow
Under the watch of the old grows shadow
Echoes the hymn of a lost spectral glow
In the land of the otten where the ghosts
Bringing a haunting refrain
Under the silver moon, alive with the gloom's reign
In this timeless dance under the waxing moon's train
Whirling, twirling to the symphony of spectral rain
