Moonlight's beaming, coyotes screaming
On a chilled October night
Jack-o'-lanterns all gleaming
Giving off an eerie sight
On Halloween, on Halloween
Costumes hiding what's unseen
Tricks and treats, darkened streets
Join the night's ghastly gleam
Creaking doors, dusty floors
Echoes of a haunting lore
Candy corn, child reborn
Into beastly forms they've worn
On Halloween, on Halloween
Secrets whispered in between
Laughter fades, darkness invades
Welcome to the night's routine
Cobwebs hanging in the town
Gory decorations all around
Spirits rising, no disguising
Halloween's profound sound
On Halloween, on Halloween
In the night's peculiar scene
Ghostly guests in pursuit of the best
Screams of joy and fright convene
End the night with a final fright
Retreat from Shadowstar
Off goes the chackle, laughter like weeping Halloween's
Bitter dark on Halloween, oh Halloween reality is not what it seems
In the mourn return to the norm, leaving behind a night of dreams
