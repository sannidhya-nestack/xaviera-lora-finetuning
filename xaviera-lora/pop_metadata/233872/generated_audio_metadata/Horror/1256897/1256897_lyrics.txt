Spooky night, come and take flight
In the realm of the moon's eerie light
Pumpkins grinning, spirits spinning
In this twisted Halloween night
Halloween, Halloween, mysteries unseen, shadows whispering the tales of the obscene
Masked faces, haunted places, we are lost in a Halloween dream
Cobweb blankets, witches, tankards
Spectral figures begin to unite
Candles glowing, winds are blowing
In this haunted Halloween's twilight
Halloween, Halloween, ever so mean
Don't get lost in the forest evergreen
Ghosts are creeping while you're sleeping
In the world of this Halloween
So beware of the fright, never go out of sight
Keep your treats close and hold your candles bright
Yet in all its uncanny gleam
We celebrate this thrilling Halloween
So beware of the fright, never go out of sight
Keep your treats close and hold your candles bright
Yet in all its uncanny gleam
We celebrate this thrilling Halloween
