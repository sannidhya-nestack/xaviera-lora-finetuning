In the somber heart of night, under the pale moon's glow
Through the haunt of hollow echoes where cold winds blow
There reigns a chilly silence beneath the raven's flight
A symphony of shadows in the theatre of the night
Music swells in the crypt of our hearts
Stirring tales of love entwined in our hearts
We dance in the haunted halls in costumes so grand
Lost in mystic walks in our nocturnal bands
Among the eerie whispers in the forest's gloom
In midnight's lullaby where the phantoms bloom
The villain's laugh echoes, the herald's cry splits the air
Drama unfolds in the moonlight, a gothic tale will wear their
Our propulsion then brings forth the twilight's embrace
Softly strains the strings setting our pace
In graveyards orchestra under the starry splend
We walked in the realm of shadows in our spectral bands
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
In the caves of the night, amongst the silent tombs
Resides an opus of the macabre in the gloom
A haunting ghostly serenade, a time forever damned
We are the creatures of the night, we are the shadows bound
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
