Shadows fall (shadows fall)
Hear the call (hear the call)
Halloween is here tonight
Fear will rise beneath the light
Ghosts are laughing, witches fly
Bats are screaming through the sky
Creeping closer, don't you see?
Halloween has captured me
Halloween, Halloween, scream it loud, it's Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, join the night, the fear, the scene
Doors are creaking, footsteps near, every shadow hides a fear
Candles flicker, spirits play, Halloween will make you stay
Who's afraid? (Not me)
Who's awake? (We see)
Raise your voice, the night is ours
Halloween beneath the stars
Halloween, Halloween, scream it loud, it's Halloween (hey, hey, hey)
Halloween, Halloween, join the night, the fear, the scene (hey, hey, hey)
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, the night of fear has just begun
