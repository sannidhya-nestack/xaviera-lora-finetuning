Late at night when the moon is high
And the autumn wind whistles by
Creatures crawl and broomsticks fly
Welcome to our Halloween night
Creepy shadows, ghostly frights
Owl hoots and pumpkin lights
Through the darkness something bites
It's Halloween, hold on tight
Halloween, Halloween, haunting and a chill
Black cats crawl and witches will
Ghosts and goblins up the hill
Spooky through, it's Halloween still
In graveyards bones will dance
Skeletons grin in a trance
Under the moonlight's eerie glance
On Halloween they take their chance
Wicked laughs and blood-curdling screams
Don't close your eyes it's not a dream
Beware what lurks unseen
It's Halloween, reign of the unseen
Halloween, Halloween, on a Friday's green card
Pumpkins, mice, they're wicked lean
Candles flicker in the theme
It's Halloween, feel the extreme
As the night fades, the sun will rise
Halloween ends with weary sighs
Until next year's creepy surprise
Goodbye Halloween, it whispers and dies
