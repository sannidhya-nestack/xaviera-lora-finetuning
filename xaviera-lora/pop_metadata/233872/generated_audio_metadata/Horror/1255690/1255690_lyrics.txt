It's Halloween night, and the moon is bright
Let's put on our costumes and give a fright
Jack-o-lanterns glowing with a spooky smile
We're going trick-or-treating, walking mile by mile
Halloween, Halloween, it's our favorite night
Candy ghosts and ghouls taking flight
Haunted houses, scary stories, and a witch's brew
Oh Halloween, we love you
Wearing a witch hat, or maybe a cape
We'll scare away the ghosts, there's no escape
Candy corn and chocolate bars galore
Knock knock knock, let's ask for more
Halloween Halloween, it's our favorite night
Candy ghosts and ghouls take in flight
Creepy crawlies, scary stories and a witch's brew
Oh Halloween, we love you
Wearing a witch hat, or maybe a cape
We'll scare away the ghosts, there's no escape
Candy corn and chocolate bars galore
Knock knock knock, let's ask for more
Halloween Halloween, it's our favorite night
Candy ghosts and ghouls taking flight
Creepy Chloe's black cats and a full moon view, oh Halloween
We love you, so let's sing and dance beneath the moonlight glow
In our spooky costumes we'll put on a show
Halloween, Halloween, what a night of delight
Now let's all say boo and give a good fight
