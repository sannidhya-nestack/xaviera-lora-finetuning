In the depths of the night, under the pale moonlight
In a world unseen, where shadows convene
The land of the minute, where spirits inhabit
Spinning tales of dread, in the words left unsaid
In the silence we dance in an echoing trance
To the unseen tune of an ominous moon
The whispering breeze through the rustling leaves
Tell tales untold in whispers of old
Through the corridors grim
Where the light is dim
Lurk phantoms unseen
In a world in between
An ominous call
A bone chilling gnaw
Mark the unholy hour
Of the spectre's power
In the silence we sing
Tales that fear brings
Under the ghastly glow
Where forbidden things go
Glimmering ghasts
A bone shall ignore
Mark the unholy hour
Of the spectre's power
In the haunting of night
Under cover of twilight
In the breathless pause
Of the jackal's jaws
In silence we roam
The otten loam
To return once more
When darkness restores
