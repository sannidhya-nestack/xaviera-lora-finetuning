Halloween, Halloween, spooky fun
Underneath the glowing moon and the night's just begun
Ghostly shadows, creatures of fright
We're all out to play on this Halloween night
Halloween, Halloween, candy and cheer
Magical whispers fillin' your ear
Knock on doors with all our might
Trick or treat, we say with delight
Halloween, Halloween, pumpkin shine
Witches and goblins, it's your time
In our costumes we feel so bright
Making memories in the pale moonlight
Halloween, Halloween, thrills and chills
The night is filled with laughter and thrills
With every pumpkin gleaming bright
Oh what a playful, spooky sight
Halloween, Halloween, it's time to say goodnight
With full bags of candy and hearts filled with delight
We'll dream of this magic, oh so bright
Until next Halloween takes flight
Halloween, Halloween, candy and cheer
Magical whispers fillin' your ear
Knock on doors with all our might
Trick or treat, we say with delight
Halloween, Halloween, pumpkin shine
Witches and goblins, it's your time
In our costumes we feel so bright
Making memories in the pale moonlight
Halloween, Halloween, thrills and chills
The night is filled with laughter and thrills
With every pumpkin gleaming bright
Oh what a playful spooky sight
Halloween, Halloween, it's time to say goodnight
With full bags of candy and hearts filled with delight
We'll dream of this magic, oh so bright
Until next Halloween takes flight
