In the forest, dark and dreary, stood a house of midnight's fears
Where the wind did howl and whisper tales of witches crooned in years
Hollow thief, the night's self-shilling, children gathered near its gate
Candles flicker, shadows dancing, dare to enter, tempt their fate
Whispers in the moonless night
Cackles from the attic's height
Welcome to our haunted lair
Enter if you solely dare
Spiders spin their silken webs
Ghosts awaken from their beds
Shackled lads who scream with dread
Marking souls of witches dead
Through the yard of twisted trees
Festive lights the banshee frees
Music here refills the air
Warning those who enter there
Creepy crawlies, bats of flutter
Cobwebs thick as witches clutter
Clock strike twelve, the hour's near
Halloween hood, full of fear
Children's laughter, distant screams
Mint with shadows of dark dreams
Potions marble, cauldrons steam
In the house where witches scheme
Grab the heart, the spectral dance
Ghostly figures in a dress
Chanting spells and brewing fright
On this eerie festive night
So beware this Halloween
When you see that witch's gleam
For the house on Haughton Hill
Keeps the night's most chilling thrill
