In the heart of October, as leaves fall over, a chill in the air, you can sense the fear, oh dear
Each knock on the door brings suspense even more, as ghostly whispers you seem to hear, oh it's
Halloween costumes, candy and sea, so keen, a night where the living and the dead convene, it's Halloween
Pumpkins grin in the night, casting fear and delight
Beneath the eerie glow of moonlight
Behind each mask, a friendly face, or a terrifying fright
In this thrilling dance of the shadowy night
Oh, it's Halloween costumes, candy and scenes so keen
A night where the living and the dead convene
It's Halloween
Pumpkins grinning in the night, casting fear and delight
Beneath the eerie glow of moonlight
Behind each mask, a friendly face, or a terrifying fright
In this thrilling dance of the shadowy night
Oh, it's Halloween, laughter, screams, and spectral sheen
Unseen skirts woven in the in-between
It's Halloween
Witches soar on their flight under the veil of the night
Magic spells they chant with might
And there in the dark sparks a mysterious spark
In the thrill, in the chill of the Halloween night
Oh, it's Halloween, crowds in costumes so obscene
In the glow of a haunted twilight scene
It's Halloween
As the clock strikes twelve
Did the spooks farewell?
The mystery will stay until another spell
Halloween, Halloween
next year's ghostly scene
Tonight we dance in the Halloween dream
Whoa!
What's he talking in the night? Casting fear and delight beneath the eerie glow of moonlight
Behind each mask, a friendly face or a terrifying fright in this thrilling dance of the shadowy night
Oh, we night, oh, we night!
Oh, it's Halloween, laughter, screams and spectral sheen
Unseen spirits woven in the in-between, it's Halloween
It's Halloween
Witches soar on their flight
Under the veil of the night
Magic spells they chant with might
And there in the dark
Sparks a mysterious spark
In the thrill and the chill of Halloween night
Oh, we night
Oh, we night
Oh, it's Halloween
