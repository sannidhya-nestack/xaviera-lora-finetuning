Born beneath a spectrum
And the ghostly starlight's blue
Where races flutter through the air
Breathing tales of endless gloom
See the faces carved in glass
Spectres swaying in the dark
All Halloweens in the otten verses
Life, spirits and a universe
In the cold winds gentle kiss
Secrets laying the lyricists of age
All you do is haunted by despair
Cause of the chilling air of the love story
