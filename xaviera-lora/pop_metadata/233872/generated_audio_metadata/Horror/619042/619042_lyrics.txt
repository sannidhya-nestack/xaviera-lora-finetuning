Darkness prevails
Today nobody here has got nothing to say
Not even a whisper just to say hi
Not even a murmur from a passerby
I'm just a stranger, a lonely stranger
A stranger
But as I take the road ahead
All seems so elusive
Could all these people all be dead?
For now would be conclusive
I'm just a stranger, a lonely stranger
I'm just another stranger, yeah, another lone stranger
I'm living here in this ghost town
Another lonely stranger
Oh, I'm just a stranger
Living here in this ghost town
Oh, this lonely ghost town
