In the realm where shadows breathe
Moonlight dances on the eaves
A symphony unwinds, echoes in the night
Whispers of a tale, tricked and ghostly white
In the heart of midnight's fall
Spirit voices start to call
Echoes of the lost, soft and low
Drawing us into the afterglow
Carved pumpkins guard each door
Silhouettes somber more
An eerie lullaby, the wind begins to croon
Our souls awaken under the maroon moon
Candles flicker, casting fright
In the silence on the moor
The cobweb veil, secrets they reveal
In the house where time and space congeal
As the courts begin to feast
In shadows, fears increased
We'll love the chase in this forsaken place
Underneath the shroud of haunted grace
And as the death bell tolls
Creeping shivers touch our souls
A spectral serenade'til the dawn of day
In the realm where the living and dead play
