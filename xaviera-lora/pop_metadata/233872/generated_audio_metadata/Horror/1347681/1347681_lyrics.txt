Through winding woods where moonlight gleams
A silent path woven in dreams
The ancient trees they stand so tall
Whispering secrets answering no call
No cheerful birds no scurrying mice
Just shadows playing twice and thrice
Each step you take the ground grows cold
A spooky story centuries old
The whispering woods where secrets keep
And ancient spirits never sleep
They watch you wander lost and deep
Through the shadows where the old tales creep
A branch will snap behind your back
You spin round but find no track
A flicker of light, a fading gleam
Just a playful trick, or so it seems
The air grows thick with unknown dread
As rustling leaves dance overhead
The whispering woods where secrets keep
And ancient spirits never sleep
They watch you wander lost and deep
Through the shadows where the old tales creep
A ghostly sigh, a touch of chill
As you stand frozen, perfectly still
The trees all lean, they bend and sway
Wishing you'd simply run away
The path grows dark
The moon hides low
Where the whispering woods begin to glow
