On Halloween Eve, the moon is bright in the Pines town
On a haunted night, by the hill where the shadows roam
Stands a witch's house in a ghostly room
Oh, the wind may howl and the spirits sing
In the witch's house where the bats will fly
With a cackle and a special brew
Beware the night, for she's watching you
In the garden grows the twisted vine
Where the pumpkins cling with a sinister shine
Through the window's candlelight flakes
Casting shadows with their haunting tricks
Though the wind may howl on the spirits side
In the witch's house where the bats will fly
With a cackle and a spell she'll brew
Beware the night for she's watching you
Cobweb corners, whispers in the halls
Ancient portraits lurking on the walls
If you listen close, you can hear them all
Of the witches laughing, her eerie hum
Of the wind blowing
Howl on the spirits' side
In the witch's house where the bats will fly
Let the cat go and the spell she'll do
Beware the night, for she's watching you
When the midnight bell begins to toll
Children shiver, for she'll take us all
Through the mist her shadow creeps
Into your dreams while you softly sleep
Oh, the wind may howl and the spirits sigh
In the witch's house where the bats will fly
With a cackle and a spell she'll bring
