It's the spookiest night, it's Halloween fright
Costumes on, under the moonlight
Pumpkins glowing with a wicked smile
It's time to trick or treat for a while
Halloween, Halloween
What's behind the mask remains unseen
The spooky tales to spread the scream
That's the spirit of Halloween
Ghosts and goblins start to appear
Witches cackling filled with cheer
Candies and laughter fill the air
The thrill of fright we all share
Halloween, Halloween, when night isn't what it seems
All the ghouls lining up in teams, all the vampires that gleam
The bats take flight, the wolves they cry, it's all Hallow's Eve
Under the night sky shadows stretch and monsters loom
Beware or you may meet your doom
Halloween, Halloween
What's behind the masks remains unseen
Spooky tales to spread the scream
That's the spirit of Halloween
Ghosts and goblins start to appear
Witches cackling filled with cheer
Candies and laughter fill the air
The thrill of fright we all share
We all share
Halloween, Halloween when the night isn't what it seems
All the ghouls lining up in teams
the bonfires that gleam
The bats take flight, the wolves they creer
Witches cackling filled with jeer
Candies and laughter fill the air
But through love, fright we all share
Halloween, Halloween when the night isn't what it seems
All the ghouls lining up in teams'round the bonfires that gleam
The bats take flight, the wolves they cry
It's all Hallow's Eve under the night sky
Shadows stretch and monsters loom, beware or you may meet your doom
Beware or you may meet your doom
The bats take flight
The wolves they cry
It's all Hallow's Eve
Under the night sky
Shadows stretch and monsters loom
Beware or you may meet your doom
Beware or you may meet your doom
Doom
