In the dark of night, when the moon shines bright
There's a chill in the air, you'll feel the fright
Ghosts and goblins, witches on a flight
Welcome dear friend, it's Halloween night
Halloween, Halloween, let's celebrate the unseen
Dress up scary or funny
Be a king or a queen, trick or treat
Walking down the street
Fill up your candy, isn't it sweet?
Jack-o'-lanterns glow with a fiery grin
In the haunted houses let the games begin
Bats and spiders, skeletons so thin
Tonight the spirits dance in the Halloween spin
Halloween, Halloween, come join the festive scene
Bar for apples, play games
In the eerie sheen, laugh or scream in your spooky dream
Tonight's the night when fear is the theme
As the night fades, remember the sight
Of the magic and mystery of this Halloween night
next year when again we'll ignite
The spooky joy and delightful fright
Halloween, Halloween amidst the moon's keen
Stay safe, stay happy this Halloween
The creepiest, cookiest night you've ever seen
Goodbye'til next year, our dear Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, amidst the moods keen
Stay safe, stay happy this Halloween
The creepiest, cookiest night you've ever seen
Goodbye'til next year, our dear Halloween
