Candles flicker in the windows casting eerie light
Bony branches scratch the sky on this haunted night
Oh, the witch's house where the shadows dance
Where the ghosts and ghouls find their wicked romance
In the witch's house down the dark twisted lane
Single step inside you may never leave again
With a creak and a clatter, the midnight bell tolls
Summoning spirits from deep sunken holes
Cauldron bubbles poison, spells start to weave
Rapping at the windows lost souls starve to thieve
Spiders spin their webs in the corners of the gloom
Jack-o'-lantern grins shine slicing through the room
Oh the witch
In the witch's house where the shadows dance
Where the ghosts and ghouls find their wicked romance
In the witch's house down the dark twisted lane
Single step inside you may never leave again
Black cats hiss and the ravens call
A cackling laugh you thought you never saw
In the festering air hear the band she cried
As the witch spreads her arms and the band
