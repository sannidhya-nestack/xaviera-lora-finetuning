Spooky, spooky Halloween
It's time for fun, not to be mean
The pumpkin's shining in the night
Glowing with a sweet delight
Trick or treat, so very neat
Candies and sweets, oh what a feast
Boo, don't be scared, it's just for fun
Laugh and play until the day is done
Trick or treat, so very neat
Candies and sweets, oh what a feast
Boo
Don't be scared, it's just for fun
Laugh and play until the day is done
Ghosts and goblins, witches too
In our costumes, me and you
Under the moon, we laugh and play
On this spooky, spooky day
Trick or treat at every door
Wanting more and more and more
Spiders, bats and black cats too
That's what Halloween is all about for you
So say "boo" and give a fight
It's happy Halloween tonight when the day is done
And we've had our fun, we'll say "see you next year everyone"
