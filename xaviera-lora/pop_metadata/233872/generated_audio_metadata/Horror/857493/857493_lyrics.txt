You're new to town and you think it's alright
But you haven't heard the things that go up open at night
Because it's the sunset since the twilight
Well you better get ready for the Friday of life you see
You haven't been the rest this year
We only come out when you're tucked up in bed
Because this town was subject to a chemical spell
And now our only aim is to kill kill kill
We come out of the ground
To tear your flesh and chew it down
Remains will not be found
You'll get up and roam around
You're one of us now
Welcome to Zombie Town
Yeah, I'm fightin'
This is reality, you're not inside
The residents are searching for human brains because
They kill the pain of being a ghost
Yet the brains on the bed, you are yours, of course, you see
We're mindless creatures, we mean no harm
We only want to chew on your legs and arms forever
Yes, we bite your, your butt, stuff the shit you realize
This is an absolute victim
We come out of the ground
To tear your flesh and chew it down
Remains will not be found
You'll get up and roam around
You're one of us now
Welcome to zombie town
You're one of us now
Welcome to Zombie Town
