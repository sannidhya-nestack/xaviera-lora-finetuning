Through the misty moors, as daylight fades
A cottage creaks where shadows wait
Witches laughter fills the chilling air
Spin your tale if you dare
Halloween Eve, the spirits rise
Under the moon's cold watch for lies
A pumpkin's grin, a ghostly wail
In the witch's house, we tell our tale
Candles flicker, black cats prowl
Ravens call, a banshee's howl
Spooky whispers, the night turns cold
Secrets of the dark unfold
Halloween Eve, the spirits rise
Under the moon's cold watchful eyes
A pumpkin's grin, a ghostly wail
In the witch's house, we tell our tale
Skeletons dance in the silver light
Witches brew their spells tonight
Cogweb shimmer, shadows bloom
Enter if you seek your doom
Briar thorns and Ivy twist
Mystic fog and cursed in mist
Children gather, nerves of steel
For a night of fright surreal
Halloween Eve, the spirits rise
Under the moon's cold watchful eyes
A pumpkin's grin, a ghostly wail
