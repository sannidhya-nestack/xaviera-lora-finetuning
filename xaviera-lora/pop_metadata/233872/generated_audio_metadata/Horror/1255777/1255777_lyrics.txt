Boo, boo is Halloween, funniest night you've ever seen
Witches flying, skeletons dancing
Jack-o-lanterns are all prancing
Halloween, Halloween, trick or treat
Walking up and down the street
Candy sweet and faces neat
Every costume is a new feat
Owls hooting, cats are mewing
Look, a ghost is peeking and booing
Stars are shining, wind is blowing
Through the night, we're all going Halloween
Night's so bright, full of laughter and cheerful fright
Bring your friends, hold on tight
It's the best Halloween night
So off to bed, close your eyes
Dream of candies and pumpkin pies
Wake up early, watch the sun rise
And remember Halloween's full of surprise
Halloween, Halloween, trick or treat
Walking up and down the street
Candy sweet and faces me
Every costume is a new feat
Halloween, Halloween, trick or treat
Walking up and down the street
Candy sweet and faces me
Every costume is a new feat
Every costume is a new feat
Owls hooting, cats are mewing, look a ghost is peeking and booing
Stars are shining, wind is blowing through the night, we're all going
Owls hooting, cats are mewing, look a ghost is peeking and booing
Stars are shining, wind is blowing through the night we're all going
Owls hooting, cats are mewing, look a ghost is peeking and booing
Look a ghost is peeking and booing, look a ghost is peeking and booing
Stars are shining, wind is blowing through the night
We're all going through the night, we're all going through the night
We're the night, we're all going through the night
We're all going through the night
We're all going through the night
So off to bed, close your eyes
Drink those candies and pumpkin pies
Wake up early, watch the sunrise
And remember Halloween's full of surprise
Halloween, Halloween, that's so bright
Full of laughter and cheerful fright
Bring your friends, hold on tight
It's the best Halloween night
So off to bed, close your eyes
Dream of candies and pumpkin pies
Wake up early, watch the sunrise
