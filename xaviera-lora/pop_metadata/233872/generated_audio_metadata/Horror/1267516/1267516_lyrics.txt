In the dimming twilight hour
When the fog is rolling deep
Lies a house upon the hill
Where restless spirits creep
With pumpkins lit and shadows cast
The witch's fell is spun
On Halloween Eve, beware the night
For fright has just begun
Oh, the witch's house
Where the shadows play
On Halloween Eve, come if you dare
Don't run away
Festive lights and eerie sights
The spirits take their chance
In the witch's house beware tonight
The ghosts will make you dance
Creaking steps and whispered laughs
The cauldron starts to boil
In the gloom the witch's broom does glide across the soil
Black cats growl and owls call out
The night is full of dread
With potions stirred and curses heard
Let fear fill up your head
Oh, the witch's house where the shadows play
On Halloween Eve come if you dare don't run away
Festive lights and eerie sights
The spirits take their chance
In the witch's house beware tonight
The ghosts will make you dance
Underneath the crooked trees
The moonlight casts its spell
Where tales are told of witches old
And secrets none can tell
The haunted wind it calls your name
The jack-o'-lanterns gleam
So take a step, embrace the fright
It's more than just a dream
Oh, the witch's house
Where the shadows play
On Halloween Eve
Come if you dare, don't run away
