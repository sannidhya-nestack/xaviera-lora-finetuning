Underneath the moon so bright
Crickets whisper in the night
Pumpkins grinning left and right
It's a bewitching Halloween night
Halloween, oh Halloween
In your costume you are the queen
Through the shadows you're unseen
It's all about the Halloween man
Rustling down the darkened street
Trick or treat, a phrase so sweet
Candy flows, oh what a feat
On this ghostly Halloween beat
Halloween, oh Halloween
The fun and fear you're in between
Like the screams, change the scene
It's the magic of Halloween, me
Souls of old and spirits roam
In our hearts their ancient home
Only seen in Twilight's dome
On this enchanting Halloween tome
As the hour begins to wane
Smiles replace each little pain
Until next year's spooking rain
Goodbye goodbye to Halloween's reign
Rustling down the darkened street
Trick or treat, a phrase so sweet
Candy flows, oh what a feat
On this ghostly Halloween beat
Halloween, oh Halloween
The fun and fear your ending dream
Life will scream change don't it seem
It's the magic of Halloween memes
It's the magic of Halloween memes
