Spooky night, the moon's so bright, Halloween is here
Cackling witches, carving pumpkins, it's that time of year
Candy corn and haunted houses, bats flying in flight
Goblins, ghosts and creatures roam in the darkness of the night
Halloween, Halloween, oh what a frightful delight
Trick or treat down every street under the pale moonlight
Fearful fun, the night has just begun, laughter fills the air
Halloween, Halloween, a celebration everywhere
Crisp and cold, the tales are told of spirits rising high
Jack-o'-lanterns flicker and glow beneath the autumn sky
Shadows dance, you catch a glance of a spectre passing by
Venturing out on Halloween night, the time is nigh, oh my
Halloween, Halloween, join in the ear in the mirth
Celebrate in costume, great ghouls walk upon the earth
Candy sweet, a delicious treat
Then your watch is lair
Halloween, Halloween
Excitement fills the air
As the clock strikes midnight
All goes quiet once more
Halloween, Halloween
Oh what's in store?
next year we wait and jeer
For this chilly night fun
Halloween, Halloween
Now our song is done
