It's Halloween, it's Halloween
The best time of the year, year
Put on your costume, don't be seen
It's time for cheer, not fear, no
Trick or treat, let's hit the street
With a bag full of candy sweet
Ghosts and goblins we will meet
Halloween is oh so sweet
Jack-o-lantern shining bright
Glowing in the spooky night
See the battle on a sight
In the cool October night
Trick or treat smell my feet
Give me something good to eat
If you don't I won't be beat
I'll just laugh and call it a feat
Halloween, Halloween, now it's time to head on in
Take off your masks and let the dreams begin
We've had our fun, save the candy for a spin
Goodnight Halloween, can't wait'til you again begin
You are cute-o
We want to do you again, begin
Doing in the spooky night
Glowing in the spooky night
See the bats, oh what a sight
In the cool October night
Trick or treat, smell my feet
Give me something good to eat
If you don't I won't be beat
I'll just laugh and call it a feat
Halloween, Halloween
Now it's time to head on in
Take off your masks and let the dreams begin
We have our fun, save a candy for a spin
Goodnight Halloween, can't wait'til you work and begin
