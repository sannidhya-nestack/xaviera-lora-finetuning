A movie has a fun score
Back knock on the witch's door
Candles flicker shadows fade
Spooky secrets which is me
In the woods, a witch is there
Cats are howling everywhere
Rune sticks lie beneath the moon
Ghostly faces in the gloom
Hollow sea so dark and wild
Witches spell and goblins dial
Creaking floors and whispered cries
Underneath the haunted skies
