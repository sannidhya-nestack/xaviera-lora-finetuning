Walking through the darkness
Under the Halloween sky
Witches on their broomsticks
Party all so high
Ghosts and goblins from the streets
Jack-o-lanterns glowing sheep
Children laughing, children shrieking
Bag and sweets, they've been sleeping
Halloween
Halloween
How the light bulb did a light bulb sing
Oh Halloween
Love this night of dreams
Where nothing's white as it seems
Spooky shadows on the wall
Creepy toys in the hall
In between your spirit's call
Under a moon that it dwarfs
That bars wolves and eerie owls
In the night when no one howls
Halloween, Halloween
In your costume disguise so keen
In the dark where light's unseen
All the joys of Halloween
Haunted houses candy corn on this night when fear is born
Juggalandians flickering scorn on this night of trick and score
Halloween, Halloween, the most magical night you've ever seen
Bathed in moonlight glowing sheen, it's the night of Halloween
As the witching hour draws near
Farewell until another year
Halloween, Halloween, until again we shall meet
