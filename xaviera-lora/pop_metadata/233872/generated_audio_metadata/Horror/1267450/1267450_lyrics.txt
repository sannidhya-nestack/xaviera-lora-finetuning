In the depths of night,'neath the moon so bright
Lies a house that sends shivers and chills
Where the witches cackle and the shadows tackle
On the edge of the haunted hills
Through the creaky gate there's a chilling fate
Pumpkins grin with a ghostly charm
With their candlelight against the stirring night
Beware of the witches' farm
On Halloween Eve when the spirits weave mystic charms in the autumn air
A festooned delight with a touch of fright and dark whispers everywhere
The cauldron bubbles, mysteries and trouble spells
A cast with a wicked gleam
Black cats prowl and the night owls scowl
In this hall of sorcery
Oh, the wind it howls and the ghostly prowls
Through the corridors of dread
Where the moonlight glows and the true fear grows
In the tales of the living dead
Goblin's caper, witch's paper
