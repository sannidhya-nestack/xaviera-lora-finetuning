Uh oh, guess the big guy sent me down here
I wasn't so good, guess that's clear
When I opened my eyes, now what did I see?
Dracula up in my grill yelling "Boo" to me
Hey, he said, I'm just messing with ya man
But welcome my old stranger, I have a plan
Let me down, a creepy tunnel, fire stick in my hair
Was it shaking and it twitching? Think you understand?
Couldn't believe my eyes, it was a dance party man
Weaving monsters through the scrolling hell
Yeah, weaving monsters through the scrolling hell
I couldn't believe they were doing that cool 50's dance
Where two lines are formed, ladies facing their man
There was a werewolf banner, all in order
Apparently nobody puts Pride of Frankie in the corner
Huh, I even thought I saw the invisible man
Please don't tell the mummy, his arm fell off again
They grabbed at each other, dancing hand in hand
Done their terrified moves like nobody can
Couldn't believe my eyes, it was a dance party man
Woo, even monsters do the scrolling hell
Yeah, even monsters do the scrolling hell
Fifth and one, she ain't my head
Take me to the dance floor, what's happening?
Toss me up in the air, loving this dance party, man
Even monsters do the scrolling hell
Yeah, even monsters do the scrolling hell
When you get here, you even do the scrolling hell
