Five little pumpkins sitting on a gate
The first one said, "Oh my, it's getting late"
The second one said, "There are witches in the air"
The third one said, "But we don't care"
The fourth one said, "Let's run and run and run"
The fifth one said
I'm ready for some fun
Went the wind and out went the light
And the five little pumpkins rolled out of sight
Five little pumpkins sitting on a gate
The first one said, "Oh my, it's getting late"
The second one said, "The witch is in the air"
The third one said, "But we don't care"
The fourth one said, "Let's run and run and run"
The fifth one said, "Let's go"
I'm ready for some fun
Went the wind and out went the light
And the five little pumpkins rolled out of sight
