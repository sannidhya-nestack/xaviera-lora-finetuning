In the woods, fade a light
Through the midnight air
Shadows dance in the light
Chilling whispers share
Tales of fun make our secrets deep
And hold in the heart of the labyrinth
Where legends are told
In the realm of the spectral and unseen
Eyes that are hollow
That ghostly sheen
Between the veils where the spirits intervene
In the shadows we could be
Blood-red roses wilt in the cold night's breeze
Echoing the count of mortal symphony
Casting a cryptic alarm, a haunting pain
