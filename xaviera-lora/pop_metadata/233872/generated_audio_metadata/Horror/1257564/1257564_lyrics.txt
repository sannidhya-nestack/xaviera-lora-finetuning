(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Midnight hours drawing near, the full moon is clear
Skeletons and ghouls appear, it's that time of year
Pumpkin grins ignite the night, casting eerie light
Brooms are swept and capes take flight
It's a chilling sight
Halloween, oh Halloween
Under the moon, soft silver gleam
Candy treats, echoing feet
Spheres dance in the night song beat
Halloween, oh Halloween
Where the world's not what it seems
Step in, bleed, come let's see
The magic of Halloween
Kids run door to door
Seeking more and more
Ghostly tales of yore
Heard it days before
Whispered in the wind
Echoed in the halls
Halloween's unpinned
The excitement never falls
Halloween, oh Halloween
When the strange and spooky convene
Laughter rings and mystery clings
In the corners where shadows lean
Halloween, oh Halloween
In your magic, we're all keen
Join the spree in this glee
Celebrate the night of Halloween
As the clock strikes one
Our Jubilee is done
Until next year's fun
Goodbye Halloween, we've spun
