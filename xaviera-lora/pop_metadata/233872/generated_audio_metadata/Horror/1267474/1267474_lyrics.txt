In a village by the moor
Near the ancient open door
Stands a house in shadows cast
Where the witches' spells are fast
Spooky, eerie Halloween
Witches' house, the fear unseen
On this festive, hallowed night
Tales of terror, such delight
Candles flicker, cold winds wail
Through the air, a ghostly trail
In the attic, whispers low
Secrets only witches know
Spooky, eerie Halloween
Witches house the fear unseen
On this festive, hallowed night
Tales of terror
