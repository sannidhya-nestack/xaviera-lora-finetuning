It's Halloween, a special night
With spooky costumes, oh what a sight
We carry lanterns filled with light
And go out when the moon is bright
Trick or treat, we say with cheer
Walking around, we show no fear
With every doll we come near
Halloween, Halloween, it's here
We see pumpkins, they're everywhere
With silly faces, they seem to stare
Candy in our bags, we love to share
On Halloween, the fun fair
Trick or treat, we say with joy
Every little girl and boy with Halloween candies, oh boy
Halloween, Halloween, oh boy
Oh boy, magic of Halloween, so cool
We love dressing up, it's rule
Now it's time for bed, no fool
Goodnight, Halloween is so cool
Trick or treat, we say with cheer
Walking around, we show no fear
With every doll we come near
Halloween, Halloween, it's here
We see pumpkins, they're everywhere
With silly faces they seem to stare (stare)
Candy in our bags we love to share (share)
On Halloween the fun's fair (fair)
Trick or treat we say with joy
Every little girl and boy with Halloween candies, oh boy
Halloween, Halloween, oh boy
Magic of Halloween so cool
We love dressing up, it's rule
Now it's time for bed, no fool
Good night, Halloween's so cool
