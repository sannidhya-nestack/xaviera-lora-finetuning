Halloween's here, oh what fun
Playing in the moon, beneath the sun
Ghosts and goblins, witches in flight
Making sure your Halloween's right
Knock knock, trick or treat
Don't be scared, there's sweets to eat
Costumes on, let's all play
Happy happy Halloween day
Pumpkin smiling, glowing lights
We're all having a spooky night
A black cat here, a broomstick there
Candles flicker in the cool night air
Knock, knock, trick or treat
Filling our bags, we're goody sweet
You can hear our playful cheer
Celebrating Halloween's here
With a boo, a yay, a trick or treat
This Halloween just can't be beat
Thank you, thank you for the fun
Goodnight Halloween, we're all done
Knock, knock, trick or treat
Don't be scared, there's sweets to eat
Costumes on, let's all play
Happy, happy Halloween day
Knock, knock, trick or treat
Don't be scared, there's sweets to eat
Costumes on, let's all play
Happy, happy Halloween day
Poppy, happy Halloween day
Pumpkins smiling, glowing lights
We're all having a spooky night
A black cat here, a broomstick there
Candles flicker in the cool night air
Knock, knock, trick or treat
Filling our bags with goodies sweet
You can hear our playful cheer
Celebrating Halloween's here
With a boo, a yay, a trick or treat
This Halloween just can't be beat
Thank you, thank you for the fun
Goodnight Halloween, we're all done
With a boo, a yay, a trick or treat
This Halloween just can't be beat
Thank you, thank you for the fun
Goodnight Halloween, we're all done
Goodnight Halloween, we're all done
