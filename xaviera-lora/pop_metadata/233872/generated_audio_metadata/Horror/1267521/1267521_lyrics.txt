In a forest dark and deep
Where the shadows creep
Stands a house that's old and bleak
No one dares to peek
Oh, it's Halloween
The night when witches sing
Dance around the fire
Hear the church bells ring
Ooh, witch's house so grim
Ghosts and goblin spirits dim
On Halloween Eve, beware it seems
Nightmares come alive in your dreams
Cobwebs drape the haunted halls
Footsteps echo wide
Candles flicker on the walls
Can't find a place to hide
Through the creaking door
You hear the ghouls implore
Stay with us forevermore
In the eerie lore
Ooh, witch's house so grim
Ghosts and goblins, spirits dim
Oh, on Halloween
