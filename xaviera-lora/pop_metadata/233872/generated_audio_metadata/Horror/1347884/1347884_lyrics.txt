Past Mr. Jones's empty room
A skeleton's dancing on a broom
And in the gym, the basketball
Bounces itself right down the hall
Oh, the adventurous melody kicks in
Oh, the spooky school, what a sight
We're staying up on Halloween night
The ghouls and ghosts are here to play
Just after all the students go away
The library books all float in air
As a little ghost sits in a chair
The lunch lady's ghost makes mashed potatoes
For all the spooky little tomatoes
Oh, the spooky school, what a sight
We're staying up on Halloween night
The ghouls and ghosts are here to play
Just after all the students go away
The principal's office, quiet and cold
Holds a secret story, old and bold
A happy ghost comes out to cheer
Happy Halloween, so glad you're here
The school is empty
All is still, but what is empty? Happy thrill
