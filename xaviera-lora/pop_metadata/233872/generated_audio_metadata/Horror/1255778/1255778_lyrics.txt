Halloween is here, let's cheer
Costumes on, have no fear
Witches, ghosts, and that's so near
Halloween is here, oh dear
Trick or treat, round the street
Lots of spooky friends to meet
Knock on doors, sweets to eat
Halloween is really neat
Pumpkins glow in the night
Giving us a friendly fright
Under the moon's silver light
Halloween is pure delight
Trick or treat down the street
Lots of spooky friends to meet
Knock on doors, sweets to eat
Halloween is really neat
So wave goodbye to the Halloween night
It was quite a magical sight
We'll see you again when the time is right
Halloween, Halloween, goodnight
