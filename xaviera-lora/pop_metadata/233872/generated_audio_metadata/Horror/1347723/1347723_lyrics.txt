On the front porch, orange and bright
A pumpkin waits for the spooky night
His smile is wide, a little grin
Just waiting for the fun to begin
He watches the sidewalks
Still as can be, hoping for someone to come see
A gentle breeze, a passing car
He's ready to trick near and far
Oh jack-o'-lantern, what will you do?
Maybe a little spooky boop
He'll wink his eye and give a flash
Then watch you run in a speedy dash
He'll make a shadow jump and sway
Then laugh when you just run away
He'll make a little creaking sound
When no one's on the haunted ground
He's not so mean
He's just for fun
A spooky trick on everyone
Oh Jack-o-lantern, what will you do?
Maybe a little spooky boop
He'll wink his eye and give a flash
Then watch you run in a speedy dash
