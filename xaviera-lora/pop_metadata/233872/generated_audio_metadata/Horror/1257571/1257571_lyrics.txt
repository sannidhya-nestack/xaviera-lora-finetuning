Tonight is the smoking night
Bats take their eerie flight
Pumpkins are glowing bright
Underneath the pale moonlight
It's Halloween, a frightful delight
Ghosts and ghouls dancing in the night
Masquerades hiding faces from sight
Let's trick or treat'til the morning light
Whispers rustle through the barren trees
Mysterious shadows playing in the breeze
Cobweb-laced homes make you freeze
Tonight the spectres roam with ease
Halloween, our hearts ignite
Haunted tales told in the night
Underneath the spell of fright
We'll journey'til the dawn's first light
In the witching hour, a silent hush
The echoes of laughter, a rush
In the crisp of night, a magical brush
Just remember, it's Halloween, don't blush
