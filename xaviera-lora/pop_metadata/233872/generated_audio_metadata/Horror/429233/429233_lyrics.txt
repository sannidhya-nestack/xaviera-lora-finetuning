I was at the club, a really freaky scene
A costume party with a movie theme
Dracula caught my eye
He looked so real that I was hypnotized
I fell into a dream, it seemed
He looked into my eyes
And asked me to dance
He said he'd show me a new way
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
This is how we do it and it drives the baby nuts
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-a
This is how we do it in Transylvania
He took me to a house high on a hill
He said the after party would be a thrill
When I saw the wooden crate
I knew my vampire was not a fake
I fell into a dream
It seemed he reached out
For my hand
He started, he started to get nonsense
He said that, he said that we could fly
We could fly away
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
This is how we do it in Transylvania
Transylvania, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
This is how we do it in Transylvania
Transylvania, ah, ah, ah, uh, uh
This is how we do it in Transylvania
This is how we do it in Transylvania
Transylvania
I tried to resist
His hypnotic trance
But I followed him in the vampire dance
This is how we do it in Transylvania
This is how we do it in Transylvania (Transylvania)
This is how we do it in Transylvania
Transylvania, Transylvania, Transylvania
