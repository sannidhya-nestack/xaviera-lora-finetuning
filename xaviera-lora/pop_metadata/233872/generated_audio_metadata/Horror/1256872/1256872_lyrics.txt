In the heart of dark October
Under the haunting moon
Skeletons dancing off their slumber
To the ghostly tomb
Trick or treat on every corner
Laughing echoes in the gloom
It's the night of Halloween's order
Casting a playful doom
Halloween, oh Halloween
Nights of fright and sugary dreams
Under the spell of the moon's gleam
It's Halloween
Children with their faces painted
Echoing cries of "Boo"
Doors are open, spirits elevated, their night has just ensued
The night sky embraced by a raven, jack-o'-lanterns in full view
A tapestry of tales are woven on this night of spectral hue
Halloween, oh Halloween
Night of mirth unseen
Under the cloak of night sheen
It's Halloween
As the fever of the night weakens
Dawn begins to peer
Costumes off can be counted by the dozens
Yet the laughter we still hear
Until the next year's fine chilling season
To the darkness we say cheer
In the heart of every ghoul and goblin lives the spirit of Halloween's cheer
