In the heart of the forest, deep and dark
There's a house where shadows mark
With twisted trees and moonlit sheen
There's a witch unseen, unseen
On Halloween Eve when the wind takes flight
The witch's house comes alive at night
With whispers and songs, a haunting delight
In the cool, eerie glow of the pale moonlight
Creaking doors and rattling bones
A cauldron bubble, spirits moan
Jack-o'-lanterns with a fiery stare
Got the secrets hidden there
On Halloween Eve when the wind takes flight
The witch's house comes alive at night
With whispers and songs, a haunting delight
In the cool, eerie glow of the pale moonlight
Bats were high and owls do preach
A cat with eyes like golden bleach
Spindle spun webs that glimmer in black
Tale of tales that trace the track
On Halloween Eve when the wind takes flight
The witch's house
