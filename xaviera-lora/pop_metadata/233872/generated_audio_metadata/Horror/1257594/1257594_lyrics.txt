It's the fall time in the town
Leaves are turning brown
Locals all gather'round
Can you feel it now?
Pumpkins on the ground
Mystery in the air
Spooky faces all around
Halloween is here
Halloween, Halloween, night of witches, ghosts unseen
Trick or treat on the street, let the haunting night begin
Halloween, Halloween, laughter, screams and funny scenes
Come with me, be set free in the tale of Halloween
Beneath the moonlight glow
Shadows play their show
Costumes high and low
On this night of lore
Candy bags in hand
Knocking door to door
Imagination land
Oh, it's so much more
Halloween, Halloween in the cool of the autumn breeze
Candles bright in the night casting shades among the trees
Halloween, Halloween tales of old but evergreen
In the sight, take flight, embrace the charm of Halloween
