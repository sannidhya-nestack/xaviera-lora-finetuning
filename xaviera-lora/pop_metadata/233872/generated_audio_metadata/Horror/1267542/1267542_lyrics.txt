In the shadow of the crescent moon
Where witches dance and black cats croon
There stands a house both old and wise
Where secrets hid from prying eyes
On high we leave the spirits rise
Close we whispers fill the skies
Simple catchy yet full of dread
In the witch's house you'll be misled
Jack-o'-lanterns grin with eerie light
Casting spells into the night
Cobweb curtains, creaky doors
Footsteps echo on marble floors
On Halloween Eve the spirits rise
Ghostly whispers fill the skies
Simple, catchy yet full of dread
In the witch's house your doom is led
Horror music fills the air
Children shiver, be aware
Witches brewing dread and fear
As midnight outdraws ever near
Candles flicker, windows sigh
Spiders weaving bats who fly
Pumpkins sense and shadows
Play, welcoming the festive haunting day
On Halloween, the spirits rise
Ghostly whispers fill the skies
Simple, catchy, yet full of dread
In the witch's house, your being is led
So heed this tale and tread with care
Lest you meet your doom in there
For in that house where witches dwell
They'll cast you in their spooky
