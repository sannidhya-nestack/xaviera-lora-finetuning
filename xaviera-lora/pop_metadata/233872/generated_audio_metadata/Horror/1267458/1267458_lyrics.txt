In the village so old, everyone's here to go
But just what's the secret that no one shall know?
On Halloween Eve, the shadows still fight
Creeping through the mystery, the cold hearted night
In a house at the edge of the woods so dark
An old witch lives, her eyes like tiny sparks
Her walls are adorned with cobwebs and gloom
Candles flicker, casting shapes of impending doom
Come one, come all to the witch's house
Where spirits whisper and phantoms rouse
Fit to fright on Halloween night
Beware what lurks just out of sight
Her cauldron bubbles with a sinister brew
She'll cast a spell on those who dare to come through
Jack-o-lanterns grin with a mischievous light
Guiding weary travellers under the starlit night
Children gather in costumes they spin
Giggles turn to gasps as the winds begin
From the corners of the forest they soon shall hear
The cackle of the witch bringing chills and fear
Come one, come all to the witch's house
Where spirits whisper and phantoms rouse
Set its sight on Halloween night
Beware what lurks just out of sight
A raven perches upon the gate
Eyes like the witch's sharing her fate
Ghostly figures dance in a spectral parade
In the witch's house where legends are made
So heed the warnings as you venture near
The Witch's House is not what it may appear
Festive shadows and horror entwine
On Halloween Eve where the darklings dine
Come one, come all to the Witch's House
Where spirits whisper and phantoms rouse
Festive fright on Halloween night
Beware what lurks just out of sight
Beware what lurks just out of sight
On this dark and eerie Halloween night!
