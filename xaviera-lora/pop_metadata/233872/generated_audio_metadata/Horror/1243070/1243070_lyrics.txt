It seems to happen, one time each year
Pretty sure October, when Rick and Oates leaves
Kids be loitering, all dressed so weird
Telling myself, let's get the hell out of here
Why are these kids knocking on my door?
Why are these kids knocking?
Why are these kids knocking on my door?
Why don't these kids just leave me alone?
It's so strange, what do they want?
They like my house, they ain't giving God in walks
What's this, some kid Jehovah witness?
Give me some peace and quiet and stay out of my business
Why are these kids knocking on my door?
Why are these kids knocking
Why are these kids knocking on my door?
Why don't these kids just leave me alone?
Hey look, here come more
Hide behind my door, I'm going to settle this score
et this, I ain't going to take no risk
But my damn Alderman's going to hear about this
Why are these kids knocking on my door?
Why are these kids knocking
Trick or treat
Why are these kids knocking on my door?
Why don't these kids just leave me alone?
Why are these kids knocking on my door?
Why are these kids knocking?
Trick or treat
Why are these kids knocking on my door?
Why don't these kids just leave me alone?
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Trick or treat
