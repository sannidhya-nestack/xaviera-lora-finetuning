In an ancient garden under the moon's faint light
Sectors of shadow, pen and eerie night
Silhouettes linger in an unwavering play
In the timeless theatre of Halloween's day
Stories of the dead, the walls of the otten
The music starts to rise and the world ignites
Under the starless skies
Artificials arise from the cold stone corridors
And the otten spectre unlocks otten doors
The moon passes the echoing gloom
A melody woven from dread through
A comet's fall, a raven's flight
In the eerie realm of eternal night
A chance of hearts and memories in the castle's key
Under the gloom of Doha where shadows see it
Our own is hidden
Whispered by the ghostly choir of this Halloween night
Caught in the fate of Doha
In the blackened mirror staring back so deep
The melody of dread continues its creep
In the aura of the spectral resting grace of the city
The moon's kisses the echoing gloom
A melody woven from dread's loom
A coming fall
