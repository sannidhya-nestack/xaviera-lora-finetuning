Creeping through the shadows in the dead of night
Underneath the eerie glow of the pumpkin's light
Rattle and creak, the old wooden gate
It's Halloween night and we simply can't wait
Halloween, Halloween, tricks and treats in sight
Monsters on the prowl under the moonlight
Witches on their brooms, ghosts out to play
In our thrillingly fun, spooky Halloween soiree
We tiptoe through the graveyard, whispers in the breeze
Spirits dancing, laughing among the trees
Jack-o'-lanterns smiling, their eyes lit with glee
Telling tales of Halloween, as crazy as can be
Halloween candies may pursue dressed as zombies
Vampire speaks things that say "Boo !" hand in hand
Here we sing, we parade in the spectacular world
That Halloween has made when the clock strikes midnight
When the clock strikes midnight, the magic will fade
Leaving behind memories of the grand escapade
Until next year when the moon will shine bright
Ready for another thrilling magical Halloween night
Halloween, Halloween, tricks and treats in sight
Monsters on the prowl under the moonlight
Witches on their brooms, ghosts out to play
In our chillingly fun, spooky Halloween soiree
Angel assembly, minute I chose Mao
When every time my memories of the grand escapade
Until next year when the moon will shine bright
Ready for another thrilling magical Halloween night
