Boots full high in the dark night
Same time stars align on this Halloween night
Whispering whims, talk of fear
Yet we step out brave for adventure, we're here
Halloween, Halloween, night of fright and scream
Pumpkins glow, stories flow, it's not always what it seems
Witches fly, children cry, trick or treat they scream
Halloween, Halloween, wake up from this dream
Under the web of spiders we crawl
Ghosts in the shadows tell tales that appall
A black cat crosses our path under the moon
On this Halloween night casting a chilling tune
Halloween, Halloween with a chill in the stream
Goblins and ghouls in the night they team
Skeletons rattle in old witch's dream
Halloween, Halloween let loose a scream
Three
