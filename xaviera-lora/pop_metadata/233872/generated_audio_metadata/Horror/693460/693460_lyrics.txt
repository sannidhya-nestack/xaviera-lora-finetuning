It's Halloween, the reaper is back
And it seems it's time for a tag
Lust to kill with no looking back
Living in shadows afraid of the light
A man without a face
He comes from another place
Dimensions we can't understand
Opposite rules, we are the fools
Man without a face
He comes from a lot of names
Dimensions we can't understand
Opposite rules, we are fools
Knocking on knives of wood
He smells fresh blood
Strolling
No time to hide, is ready to fight, man without a face
It comes from another place
Dimensions we can't understand
Opposite rules, we are the fools
A man without a face
It comes from another place
Dimensions we can't understand
Opposite rules, we are the fools
A man without a face
The mansions we can't understand
Opposite rules, we are the fools
A man without a face
He comes from another place
The mansions we can't understand
Opposite rules, we are the fools
Halloween night
