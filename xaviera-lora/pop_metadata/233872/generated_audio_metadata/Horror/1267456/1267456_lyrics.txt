On a spooky Halloween night
When the moon casts eerie light
In the dark of witches house
Stands a lone soul still and quiet
With her broom she flies at dusk
In the air a chilling mouse
Black cappers her cauldron brews
Whispered spells and ghostly clues
Oh, beware, beware the witches lair
On Halloween in the midnight air
Ghosts and ghouls they gather there
In shadows deep with ghastly stare
Pumpkins grin with candle eyes
Jack-o'-lanterns tricked in guise
Hell of spirits roam the glen
Seeking souls not seen again
Cobwebs hang like silken threads
Over graves of restless dead
Please do how the old trees creak
The ish laughter hear it speak
Oh, beware, beware the witch's lair
On Halloween in the midnight air
Ghosts and ghouls, they gather there
In shadows deep with ghastly stare
Through the fog, the lanterns dim
Children's voices
Eerie hymn, rattled cries and whispered dread from the nightmares in your head
Witches brew and spells are cast
Haunted shadows moving fast
Let's you see the witches grin
Know the night of fright begins
Whistles whisper secrets weave
In the heart of all hallowed seats
Old tales and whispers told
Of a witch and fearsome cold, oh
Beware, beware the witch's lair
On Halloween in the midnight air
Ghosts and ghouls they gather there
In shadows deep with ghastly stare
Festive night of tricks and treats
Magic stirs on darkened streets
By the moon be cautious where
You tread upon the witches stare
