In the spooky cold October night
Ghostly figures cloaked in the moonlight
Bats and witches take their flight
It's a chilling Halloween sight
It's Halloween, oh what a fright
Dark as the alley, black as the night
Monsters laughing with all their might
Underneath the eerie moonlight
Skeletons rattled, spirits roam
In the haunted houses we dare not comb
Wolves howl beneath the gloaming dome
This is where the witches call home
Halloween, the time of glee
For all the creatures just to be
Dancing shadows you can barely see
It's the world we're just on a spree
Carving pumpkins, a gleaming smile
Walking down the scary horror mile
Trick or treat, it's a classic style
In this ghostly Halloween aisle
It's Halloween, no time to sigh
With ghosts and ghouls together we ally
In this fearful joy we unify
Celebrating Halloween under the night sky
As the midnight hour is drawing nigh
Bid hello to the pumpkin in the sky
On this night every scare is a high
Till we sing again this Halloween goodbye
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
