Don't be frightened of me, I promise to behave
I'm just a poor fellow in bad need of a shave
I've gotten lots of bad press, I've been misunderstood
underneath all this hair I'm really very good
Where wolf am I?
Just your average guy
Werewolf in mind
Just a hairy, shy guy
Ask yourself this question, just how would you feel
If when someone saw your face they let out with a squeal
They'd run and look for cover, they'd scream and start to cry
With that kind of reaction a fellow could get shy
Oh where with am I?
Just your average guy
Werewolf am I
Just a hairy shy guy?
Whenever there's a full moon, my ears begin to grow
I can't help their stretching like Pinocchio's nose
And sure my teeth are sharper, but I brush them every night
I even floss my molars, that proves that I'm polite
A werewolf am I?
Just your average
Where wolf am I?
Just a hairy shy guy
A hairy shy guy
A hairy shy guy
[Muffled moaning]
