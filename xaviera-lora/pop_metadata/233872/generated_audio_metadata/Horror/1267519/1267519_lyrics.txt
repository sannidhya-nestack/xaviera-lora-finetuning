On a chilly moonlit Halloween night
A witch's house glows with eerie light
In a forest dark and dreadful old
Where a spy in chilling stories told
Ooh, the witch's house, the haunted lair
Ghastly creatures meet you there
Candles flicker in the gloom
Beware the shadows, doom and doom
With a creaking crack, the dome swings wide
Spooky whispers beckon you inside
Cobweb corners, eyes that gleam
Where nightmares dwell and memories scream
Ooh, the witch's house, the haunted lair
Ghastly creatures meet you there
Candles flicker in the gloom
Beware the shadows, doom and doom
Bubbling cauldrons, potions brew
Wicked spells and curses too
Black cat hisses, eyes aflame
In the witch's house none leave the same
Ooh, the witch's house, the haunted lair
Ghastly creatures meet you there
Candles flicker in the gloom
Beware the shadows, doom and doom
