Deep in the mountain where shadows sleep
A secret cavern dark and deep
The only light is from a glowing moss
On ancient rocks a path is lost
No one has been here for a hundred years
Just silent walls that hold their fears
A single echo, faint and low
A sound of something starting to grow
The caverns call, it starts to chime
A secret song that beats with time
The stones will shift, the water will rise
To see the terror in your eyes
The ceiling drips, the air is cold
A hidden story, old and bold
This delicatess, they start to move
A haunting sound, they have to prove
That things can live down in the dark and leave
Leave a chilling, haunting mark
The caverns call, it starts to chime
A secret song that beats with time
The stones will shift, the water will rise
To see the terror in your eyes
You hear a whisper in the spray
You'll never leave here, not today
The cavern closes, locks you in
Your spooky journey can begin
The darkness settles, all is still On this enchanted, spooky hill
