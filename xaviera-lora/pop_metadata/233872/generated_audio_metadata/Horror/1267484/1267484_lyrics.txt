In a bay where shadows creep
Underneath the moonsoft weep
Stands a house of legend told
Dark and eerie secrets hold
Witches home on Halloween
Festive sights a haunting scene
Candles flicker, whispers play
Ghostly laughter, children's play
Nautilus trees and ivy twine
Windows dark with webs of light
Creak of doors and whispers spin
Spooky winds draw you in
On Halloween Eve beware the night
The witches chat in petaloon lights
Ancient spells and shadows dance
In the witch's house you take a chance
Olden Grimoire spells unbound
In this house where fears are found
Cobweb corner spirits call
Every hallway spectral frall
Tap up the steps echo near
Ghastly moans all play on fear
Lanterns glow with ghostly gleam
Bewitching all like in a dream
On Halloween Eve beware the night
The witches chant in pale moonlight
Ancient spells and shadows dance
In the witch's house you take a chance
Midnight strikes, a witch appears
Cackling spells, conjuring fears
Banshees wail and phantoms sway
In her spell, you're led astray
Potions bubble, cauldrons brew
Mystic fog, the night imbues
From the shadows, creatures rise
In this house, these spectral skies
On Halloween Eve, beware the night
The witches chat in pale moonlight
Ancient spells and shadows dance
In the witch's house you take a chance
Leave the house if you dare
Or stay and face the witch's glare
On Halloween the spirits roam
In the witch's ancient haunted home
