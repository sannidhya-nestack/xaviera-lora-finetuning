Creeping down the silent street night shroud
Wrapping round with cackle and his smile
So sweet an ancient garb were found
Ghosts and goblins will just chill under the silver moon's glow
On this eerie spiritual night with a secret no one knows
Halloween mysterious dance and master skies unfurl
With laughter screams and whisper tales as the magic unfurls
Beneath the starry cloak of night where shadows have their way
On Halloween this haunting tune enchants the spooky sway
That snake flight in the outtakes, watch, our chill fills the air
Our grinning skeleton rattles bones, but where we'll stop and stare
Trick or treat down complex lanes, fear not what may arise
Candy corn and apple bob, nighttime sweet surprise
Halloween, we splurge on the praise, tales of the ancient hex
With every ghoulish giggle echo as we move on to the next
In every corner shadows dance as if they're truly looming mine
On Halloween we play this tune under the moon, we thrive
As the windless spirits dance and mass disguises burl
With laughter, screams and whispered tales as the magic unfurls
Beneath the starry cloak of night where shadows have their way
On Halloween this haunting tune enchants the spooky sway
As the liching hour draws near
And the moonlight's glow does it wail
We'll pack away our ghostly cheers
Till the spirits dance again
Howling in a haunted night
next year's frightful delight
