The shadow of the moon is all that glow
Through the gardens where the dark roses glow
The chilling whispers of the vanished souls
The twisted through the forest find their holes
They wear the veil of the midnight sun
Where wailing spirits weep and the shadows make their own
With the chilling whisper of the gale
Dances the twisted melody of a mournful tale
Man and ebony veils for the phantom's veil
Through the halls of the haunted darkness will prevail
In dark corners, the arrows of despair are sewn
In the silent theater of the night, the shadows have grown
As the strings of the marionettes are drawn
By the hands of the unseen and the break of dawn
Among the myriad starlight, warping silhouettes move
Under the waiting moonlight where the regrets still prove
