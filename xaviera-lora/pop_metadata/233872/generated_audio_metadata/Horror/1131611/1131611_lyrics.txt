I'm not afraid of the dark, I'm not afraid of the dark
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord I pray
Make me pretty, pretty and dumb for a day
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord I pray
Lord I pray
Make me pretty, pretty and young for a day
Give me dreams
Give me hope
Make me believe
In chocolate and in soap
And in soap
Oh Lord I pray
Oh Lord I pray
Oh Lord I pray
Oh Lord I pray, pray, pray
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord I pray
Lord I pray
Make me pretty, pretty
And dumb for a day
God I pray, pray, pray
