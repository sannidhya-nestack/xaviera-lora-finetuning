We're hearing out where shadows creep While the world's asleep
In graves below, the dead awake
It's Halloween, make no mistake
Trick or treat, the children plead
On this night of ghostly deeds
Pumpkins green, with fiery sight
In tales of eerie October night
The creeping leaves and chilling breeze
Whisper secrets in the trees
Costumes of ghouls and witches' frights
Dancing in the moon's pale light
Trick or treat, door to door
Not knowing what's in store
Halloween, Halloween
Shadows longer than they've ever been
La la la, oh Halloween
Your spirit is unseen
Spooky as night, filled with fright
Under the moon's silver gleam
The burning candles begin to wane
As comes the dawn ending Halloween's reign
A night of fun, of delightful scare
Until next year Halloween will be there
The crackling leaves and chilling breeze
Whisper secrets in the trees
Costumes of ghouls and witches' frights
Dancing in the moonlight
Sharecrocks reach door to door
Not knowing what's in store
Halloween, Halloween
Shadows longer than they've ever been
La la la, oh Halloween
Your spirit is unseen
Spookiest night filled with fright
Under the moon's silver gleam
