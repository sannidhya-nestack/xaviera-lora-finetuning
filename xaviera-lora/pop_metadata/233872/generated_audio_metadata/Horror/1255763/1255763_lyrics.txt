It's Halloween night, so full of fright
Ghosts and goblins out in sight
Trick or treat down the street
Looking for something good to eat, eat
Halloween, Halloween, such a spooky scene
Costumes on and treats in the bag
With each doorbell our hearts will drag
Pumpkins shining bright in the moonlight
Witches flying, oh what a sight
Candy here, candy there, candy everywhere
It's Halloween night, so don't get scared
Halloween, Halloween, fun for you and me
Scary faces, tricks and treats
All part of Halloween sweet feasts
When the night is done, we've had our fun
Halloween, Halloween, you're the one
Now it's time to sleep tight
Goodnight Halloween, goodnight
Halloween, Halloween, fun for you and me
Scary faces, tricks and treats
All part of Halloween, sweet peace
When the night is done, we've had our fun
Halloween, Halloween, you're the one
Now it's time to sleep tight
Goodnight Halloween, goodnight
Halloween, Halloween, fun for you and me
Scary faces, tricks and treats
All part of Halloween, sweet feast
When the night is done, we've had our fun
Halloween, Halloween, you're the one
Now it's time to sleep tight
Goodnight Halloween, goodnight
When the night is done
