Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
I'll pray the Lord my soul to take
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord, I swear to keep
With God's ID4 I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
I pray the Lord my soul to take
