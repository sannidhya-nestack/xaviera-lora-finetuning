In a forest dark and deep, where the shadows prey and creep
Stands a house of ancient lore, which as whispers tales of yore
On Halloween, the witches stir
In the night, their spells confer
Candles flicker, cauldrons bubble
Drawing darkness, brewing trouble
When the moon is full and bright
On this eerie haunted night
Witching hour now begins
With spooky tales and ghostly winds
Down the path of cobblestone
To the house of wood and bone
Children dare not venture close
For the tales of woe they know
Bats take flight and owls hoot
Dead leaves crunch beneath your boot
From the window shadows leer
Filling hearts with chilly fear
When the moon is full and bright
