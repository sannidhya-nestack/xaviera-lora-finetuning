In the deep, chilling heart of the night
Underneath the haunting moon's light
There lies a realm engulfed by fright
Darker, deeper than the endless plight
Howling, the spirits dance
Or graves, they shift in their trance
Dark ambience, echoes enhancing the chance
That the shadows of fears, they dance
Whispering winds tell tales of dread
In the realms where the living dare not tread
Gypsy souls lost and misled
They've bled
Halloween with its haunting glance
In the abyss, the phantoms prance
Midnight chimes signal their advance
In the solar spectacle, we're in a trance
Halloween with its haunting glance
More graves they shift and then their trance
Dark graves they shift and their trance
Dark cambion echoes enhancing the chance
In the shadows of fears they enhance
With its haunting glance
In the silence of all Hallows Eve
When the dark corners begin to weave
Halloween when the unseen believe
