In the chill of the October air
There's an eerie feeling everywhere
Shadows dancing in the pale moonlight
Halloween's here
Feel the spooky night
Halloween night, oh Halloween night
The ghost sandwich is taking flight
Pumpkins smiling with the glowing lights
Ghouls and giggles in the misty sights
Creeping through the haunted house
Quiet as a sinister mouse
Spider webs and bats so high
Horror tales underneath the sky
Oh Halloween night, unending fright
Monsters sneaking out of sight
Laughing skulls and mysterious blood
In the darkness holding you tight
Sweet treats offered with a trick
Scary costumes in every pick
Follow the lanterns, they're guiding quick
In the Halloween magic, don't you stick?
Halloween night, heartbeats spike
Under the glowing moonlight
In the strange daylight
Because it's Halloween night
So dance with the spirits, lose your fright
In the web of the endless night
Until the sun makes its first light
Remember, it's all Halloween's delight
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
