In search of the black beneath the shrouded moon
Lies a land untouched by sun where shadows rule
Church bells toll midst echoes old
Whispering tales untold
Gargoyles grin in silence sitting under the call
'Tis the night in devil's sight beneath the twisted spire
Of steam-choir sings lullabies of headless desire
Through haunted echoes secrets lie, if whispered they conspire
Love-souls dance amidst the trance
On the sun in harrowing bone
With his great stone and crypt
Still it warms in love forlorn from his cold grip
On the tower in symphony angels speak in glee
It's the end of the mortal way
Like the ghost of day
the night, in ghostly might
A fist of phantom fire
Stirl it in, stir the wind
In sickness it's harmless and scream into the still fire
Shadows kiss in death and bless it as the sword's in fire
It will weave of old green and still the dark dim lights
Shut them up and sing it for the world
It's like the dreams and the fear of the skies
