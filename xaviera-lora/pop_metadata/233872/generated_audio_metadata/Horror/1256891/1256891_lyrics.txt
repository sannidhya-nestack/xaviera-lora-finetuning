I made some very bumpy zonkers, high-fi spotters, splendid squeakies
Why, I seem stylish, although they chewed weed
But save the space, they're the only music sites to tap
Newton had a vast real one, but the rival had come the jury's trying to see to a breed
That was offensive
Underneath the moon so bright
On Halloween we walk
Costumes glad in mystic light
On doorsteps we'll knock
Candy bags and orange glow
The shadows dance and weave
A haunted night of tricks and treats
Is what we dare conceive
Oh Halloween night of fright
Filled with gearing delight
Ghosts and ghouls take flight
Under the ghastly moonlight
Our life fulfills the crisp night air if we run without a care
Black cats cross our winding path
Witches roam the night
Jack-o'-lanterns cast their laugh
As we squeal in fright
Through the graveyard misty cold
Shuffle and unknown
We're hand in hand, bold and brave
Yet never quite alone
Oh, howling when shadows play
And secrets are unfurled
Mysteries hidden in the flame
This otherworldly world
We revel in the spooky charm
Safely nestled, arm in arm
As the midnight hour
