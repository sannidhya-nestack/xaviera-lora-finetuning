On a foggy Halloween evening the old will train
Lies a house of spooky fame, that's where the witches be
Candles flicker, shadows dance, laughter fills the air
Pumpkins grinning on the porch, whispers everywhere
Come one, come all, to the witches' hall
Where the spells are cast and the shadows fall
In the haunted night under pale moonlight
Join the witches' call, feel the ghostly fright
Cobwebs drape the ancient doors, creak the wooden floors
Pictures gaze with haunted eyes, portraits of folklore
Cauldron bubbles thicken green, spells are being spun
Twisted tales and eerie wails, the haunting has begun
Come one, come all to the Witch's Hall
Where the spells are cast and the shadows fall
In the haunted night under pale moonlight
Join the Witch's Call, feel the ghostly fright
Witches broomsticks sweep the sky, black cats prowl the halls
Phantoms wail and spirits fly as midnight loudly calls
Ghosts in pools and spectral dance, the night is dark and wild
Join us in this spooky prance where terror is beguiled
Come one, come all to the Witches' Call
Where the spells are cast and the shadows fall
In the haunted night under pale moonlight
Join the Witches' Call, feel the ghostly fright
Oh, honey
