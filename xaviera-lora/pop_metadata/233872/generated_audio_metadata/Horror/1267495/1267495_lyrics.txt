In the shadow of a moon, down a twisted lane
Stands a house in dark, so drenched in pain
Windows creak as whispers ride the breeze
Wicked shags dance amongst the trees
Oh, it's Halloween-y, under witch's spell
In the ghostly house where dark spirits dwell
Candles flicker, shadows grow tall
In the night, hear the haunted call
Lights dim, flames, the clock strikes twelve
From the attic or the old bookshelf
Potions bubble in cauldrons green
Where the witches' cackle begins to sheen
Oh, it's Halloween Eve, under witches' spell
In the ghostly house where dark spirits dwell
Candles flicker, shadows grow tall
In the night, hear the haunted call
Oh, it's Halloween Eve, under witch's spell
In the ghostly house where dark spirits dwell
Candles flicker, shadows grow tall
In the night, hear the haunted call
Spires weave webs, and corners bleak
Ghosts lose their secrets, enchanted unique
Wraith's perch on the roof's high
With gleaming eyes under blood-red sky
Children's laughter fades as the night descends
On this hallowed eve where the horror blends
Jack-o'-lanterns grin with eerie light
Guarding the path through the darkest night
Oh, it's Halloween eve under witch's spell
In the ghostly house where dark spirits dwell
Candles flicker, shadows grow tall
In the night, hear the haunted call
Only wear the house when the witching hour is near
For on Halloween Eve, it's the night of fear
Listen closely to the echoes afar
The witch's house under the midnight star
