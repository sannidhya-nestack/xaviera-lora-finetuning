Inside the spooky mansion, the party's just begun
For every ghost and ghoul under the moon's pale fun
The mummies shuffle wrapped in white
The vampires laugh with all their might
A silly zombie does a dance with one last happy zombie glance
The black cats purr, the witches swoon
Dancing under the harvest moon
It's a monster mash, a ghost delight (delight)
We're here to party all through the night (night)
With creepy crawly dancing feet
Oh what a wonderfully spooky treat
The skeletons tap their bony hands
The werewolves howl across the land
You hear a "boo" and then a giggle
Watching all the monsters wiggle
The bats fly out in a loopy chain
They're all just happy it's Halloween
It's a monster mash-a-goosey life (mash-a-goosey life)
We're here to party all through the night (night, night)
With creepy crawly dancing feet
Oh, what a wonderfully spooky treat (spooky)
The walls all groan, the lights go dim
We start to hear a ghostly hymn
But then a funny vampire sings
And happy laughter with him rings
The party's ending, the sun's awake
A memory for goodness sake
