Hey, who's that? What the hell are you doing here? What do you want?
Stop!
Drop your weapon, I saw a stranger yesterday
I said, "You're all sadness, all the time you've got no me"
If I fell but I could not see me
My face was a happy big fairy
Waiting the last midnight
Watching the rocket I have seen it today
In yellow H-6
The range is well watched but
Don't do it again, don't run
Stay in hope inside of me
Don't feel too long
I do it again, I will run
I will hold, I don't stay inside
And he talks, yeah, I try to tell him stop
I try to sleep, I try to run
But he takes control, control, control
I'm gonna fuck, I'm gonna kill, I'm going to eat everyone here
I'm gonna fuck, I'm gonna die tonight
