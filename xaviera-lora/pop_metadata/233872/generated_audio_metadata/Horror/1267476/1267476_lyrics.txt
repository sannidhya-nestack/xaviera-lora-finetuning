On Halloween Eve as the fire grows thick
Where the shadows dance and the candles flick
There's a house on the hill with a creek and a groan
Where the wind whips soft and the spirits moan
In the witch's house where the cauldron brews
And the black cat hisses at the nightly use
The ghosts arise from their endless sleep
With whispers and secrets that they keep
Oh, gather round the witch's lair
With her fiery eyes and her tangled hair
She's stirring dreams in the midnight air
On this spooky, spooky Halloween
The old oak trees in the garden sway with twisted branches that seem to say
Beware, beware of the witch's grin for once you're here there's no way out or in
The lanterns blaze with an eerie glow
Jack-o'-lanterns line the path below
Children giggle with a hint of fright
As they tiptoe through the ghostly night
Oh, gather round the witch's lair
With her fiery eyes and her tangled hair
She's casting spells in the moon's own glare
On a spooky, spooky Halloween
The werewolf howls and the broomsticks fly as witches cackle beneath the sky
In the witch's house the night is long with a haunting tune like a wicked song
So heed the warnings young and old of the witch's tales that have long been told
For when the clock strikes the witching hour you'll feel her spell her dark dark power
Oh, gather round the witch's lair
With her fiery eyes and her tangled hair
She's weaving dreams in the midnight air
On this spooky, spooky Halloween
Oh, gather round, gather round
In the witch's house where the screams resound
Feel the magic in the haunted ground
Of this spooky, spooky Halloween
