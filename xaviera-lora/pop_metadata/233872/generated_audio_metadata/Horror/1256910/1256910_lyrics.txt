On the eve of Halloween where the shadows creep
Pumpkins operating as the world's asleep
Children in costume prepared to scare
Door to door if you dare
Halloween, Halloween night of tricks and treats
Ghouls and witches dancing to the spooky
Jack-o'-lanterns flicker in the chilling breeze
A symphony of fried-ed tea's
A black cat prowls under the lucinista glow
Through the misty night secrets in the shadows grow
Witching hour approaches feeling the spectral chill
On this October night tales of spook we seal
Halloween, Halloween, where fear and fun combine
Darkness is our playground, under the stars we'll dive
Sweet candies, echoes of delight
In the thrilling, chilling Halloween night
So here's to the night when we embrace the unknown
In the heart of October when the year recedes us own
Halloween, Halloween under the witching moon sheen
Express the joy, unveil the dream
Wake the spirit of Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, night of tricks and treats
Ghouls and witches dancing to the spooky beats
Jack-o-lanterns flicker in the chilling breeze
A symphony of fright and tease
Halloween, Halloween, night of tricks and treats
Ghouls and witches dancing to the spooky beats
Jack-o-lanterns flicker in the chilling breeze
A symphony of fright and tease
