In the heart of shadows, where the restless spirits dance
Listen close, you'll hear the whispers of the night's romance
A chilling laugh echoes under the moon's pale glance
Shadows gather in the corners, taking their dark stance
In the theatre of the dark, sing the haunted lullabies
Under the cloaked moon, watch as reality defies
The rhythm of the tread, like an old and tarry toad
Beware the melody of the night, so painfully cold
The castle lights have dimmed
Masks of ghoulish delight
Eyes hidden behind reflecting fierce fright
The strings drum a dirge setting the scene
An opera of nightmares welcome to the Halloween
Raise the phantom's orchestra
Stirring up the quiet dread
The dance of the otten where the living fear to tread
In every cheering note
Not by the moon's peace sound
A lowering harmony
A track where every fear is sold
And so ends the night's eerie symphony
Fading into the flow
Leaving behind echoes of the haunted show
The Halloween orchestra ends its ghastly woe
Closing the chapter of dark'til next year's glow
Ooh, ooh, ooh
