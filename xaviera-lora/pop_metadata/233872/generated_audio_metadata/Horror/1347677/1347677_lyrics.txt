Round and round the carousel spins
A spooky party for all our friends
The witches ride on broomstick horses
The ghosts all laugh in ghostly forces
A happy mummy waits to greet
With a smile so wonderfully sweet
A black cat purrs on a purple sea
The spooky fun can't be beat
It's a Halloween carousel, a magical ride
With all the spooky friends inside
We go round and round without a care
The jolliest, funniest ride of the year
The carousel lights, they glow so bright
Underneath the Halloween moonlight
A skeleton waves his bony hand
The happiest spook in all the land
The silly zombies just stand and stare
With goofy grins and messy hair
It's the Halloween Carousel, a magical ride
With all the spooky friends inside
We go round and round without a care
The jolliest, funniest ride of the year
Neither slows down
With a single echo, oh
Airwing carousel chime and a sound of thunder
The carousel slows, the music fades
Through the ghostly misty glades
But then a funny little bird
Flies by and tips his tiny hound
The ride is over, the fun is through
Until next year for me and you
