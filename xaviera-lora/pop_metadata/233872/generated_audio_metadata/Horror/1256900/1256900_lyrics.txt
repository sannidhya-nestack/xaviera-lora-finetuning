In the chill of the night, in the pearl moonlight
Through the whispers of leaves, something isn't right
Pumpkins shining bright, spirits take flight
It's Halloween night, hold on tight, oh it's Halloween
Scary as seen, monsters and shadows making quite a scene
It's a thrilling delight, this spooky night
Halloween, when the world's full of fright
Witches on broomsticks
Cats with a sneer, skeletons dancing, spreading the fear
Cobwebs in corners, ghosts reappear
It's Halloween, the best time of the year
Yes it's Halloween, with the chilling sheen
Trick or treats the game, things are never what they seem
Candy bags in hand, we're part of the band
On this foolish bewitching
Halloweenland
When the clock strikes twelve, secrets to delve
The night comes alive in stories we tell
So here ends the tale of this ghostly veil
Until next Halloween when again we set sail
Oh it's Halloween
Scariest scene
Monsters and shadows making quite a scene
It's a thrilling delight
This spooky night
Halloween when the world's full of fright
