Halloween is here, let's jump and cheer
With pumpkins round and costumes clear
We knock on doors and call out clear
Trick or treat, do not fear
Halloween, Halloween's so much fun
Candy costumes for everyone
Ghosts and goblins are on the run
Underneath the bright moon sun
We see a house so big and white
We all approach with pure delight
The door creaks open, what a sight
Yummy treats in the spooky night
Halloween, Halloween, let's not hide
Join in the fun, come outside
Witches and wizards side by side
In this magical mystery ride
So let's sing loud with all our might
Enjoy this magical Halloween night
Don't be scared, hold on tight
Happy Halloween, say it right!
Halloween, Halloween's so much fun
Kinney costumes for everyone
Ghosts and goblins are on the run
Underneath the bright moon sun
So goodbye now, it's time to slip
Memories of Halloween they'll keep
Close their eyes, count to sheep
Dream of Halloween, oh so deep
Halloween, Halloween, oh what fun
Time for treats for everyone
Spooky costumes, ghosts and bats
we go, in our hats
Trick or treat, say it loud
Walking proud, in the crowd
Knock on doors, call it out
Halloween is here, no doubt
Jack-o'-lanterns grinning wide
In the dark, where they hide
Candies sweet and apples tart
Halloween is a work of art
Trick or treat, say it clear
Halloween is once a year
Lots of fun and a little fear
Halloween time is here
So sing this song with all your might
And celebrate the Halloween night
Say goodnight and turn off the light
Tomorrow another delightful sight
