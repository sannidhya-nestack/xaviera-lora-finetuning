On Halloween Eve when the moon's low and pale
Through the fog and the mist a shadowy tale
There stands a house by the dark woodland trail
Where witches and whispers in the night prevail
Spooky nights and eerie sights
Where witches brew their ghastly plights
In the witch's house our fears ignite
On this festive frightful Halloween night
Creaky floors and cobweb doors
Where ghostly wails forever soar
Candles flicker with unseen chore
In the gloom where shadows dance galore
Goblins gather round the old witch's lair
Spirits wail and banshees tear
Black cats prowl with an icy stare
Beware the curse that lies in there
Spooky nights and eerie sights
Where witches brew their ghastly plights
In the witch's house all fears ignite
On this festive frightful Halloween night
Through haunted woods, the owls cry
Bats take flight across the sky
Underneath the witch's eye
Many dare, but few survive
Hear the chants and spells unfold
