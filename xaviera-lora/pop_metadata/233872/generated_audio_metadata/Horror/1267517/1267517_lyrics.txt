In the heart of a woodland on a frosty night
Stood a witch's house in the pale moonlight
Ghostly shadows dancing with the trees
Haunted whispers carried on the breeze
Hallows eve the spirits come alive
Through the dark, the witches thrive
Candles flicker in the cough, pumpkins grin
Let the eerie fair begin
Chimney smoke coils into the sky
Bats and ravens start to fly
Black cats purr with eyes aglow
Skeletons walked below
Ghastly goblins, eerie ghouls
Round the witch's cauldron spin and drool
Winds howl a chilling refrain
Round the witch's house again
Creaky doors and haunted floors
Every shadow hides much more
Footsteps echo in the night
In the witch's home, a ghastly fright
Spiders creep, their webs do spin
Monsters grin with wicked grins
In the cauldron, whispers flow
Boiling secrets down below
