I say, isn't that King Rat?
(Sounds of King Rat)
Say no, you suckers!
Coast to coast, sewer to sewer
King Red is back, across the nation
Shake your tail, sharpen your claws
It's party time, down below
Get your sticky paws off me half-eaten crab
I'll clip you round the ear and twist it'til it's fat
I'm King Red, King Red, King Red, King Red
Howdy kiss kiss, Ferdy cheese
All night on, bio stringly
Wiggly in the arse, knock your knees
Style and chubby, stuck in me teeth
I didn't lock my neighbours, I say scare them away
Put petrol down the drain, watch them lift off
I'm King Red, King Red, King Red, King Red
Now I've been dreaming of retirement, yes
Rest my fur out in the sun, yes
Give someone else a chance to rule the nest
What about this fishbone, King Red?
Take it, take it, I'm retired
Take it, take it all
Baby, one day
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm King Rats! King Rats! King Rats! King RATS!
Watch me move! Ooh! I've still got it! And a move! Yes! Hey hey hey!
Ladies and gentlemen, the RATATS! King Rats! King Rats! King Rats!
Finger that, finger that, finger that, in black
