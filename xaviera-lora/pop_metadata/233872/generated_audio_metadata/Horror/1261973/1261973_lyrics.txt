In the dead of night, under the waning moon
Where shadows stretch, at aura's low
The whispers drift, carried by the gloom
An eerie melody, the dark's haunting tune
Halloween, with your chills so stark
The night alive, with a misted spark
Dark ambience
Silence, specters and bark
Those figures were a man-haunt
As their whispers filled the air so daunt
The shadows dance, a chilling flaunt
Lost soul
In their wants
Handled in the shadows start to part
Playing tricks on the beating heart
Under the wake of the dark
Ambient art
Unseen horrors in the darkness dart
Upon the midnight of All Hallows Eve
We pay tribute to the ones who breathe
Through the heart
