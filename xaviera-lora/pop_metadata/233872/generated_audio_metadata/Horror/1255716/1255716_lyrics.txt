Halloween, Halloween, what a sight
Jack-o'-lantern shines so bright
Little goblins run and play
All on this spooky day
Halloween, oh Halloween
It's the funniest thing we've seen
Trick or treat from door to door
Give us sweets, we always want more
Bats and cats and witches galore
Candy apples oh we adore
Pumpkins here pumpkins there
Pumpkins pumpkins everywhere
Halloween oh Halloween
In our costumes we'll be seen
From the houses down the street
Halloween is a tasty treat
That's our song, it's Halloween night
Time for scares and pure delight
Can't wait'til next year's spooky scene
Happy, happy Halloween
Halloween, oh Halloween
It's the funniest thing we've seen
Trick or treat from door to door
Give us sweets, we always want more
Bats and cats and wishes galore
Candy apples, oh we adore
Pumpkins here, pumpkins there
Pumpkins, pumpkins everywhere
Halloween, oh Halloween, in our costumes we'll be seen from the houses down the street
Halloween is a tasty treat
Is a tasty treat
That's our song, it's Halloween night
Time for scares and pure delight
Can't wait'til next year's spooky scene
Happy, happy Halloween
Plus our song, it's Halloween night
Time for scares and pure delight
Can't wait'til next year's spooky scene
Happy, happy Halloween
