On this chilling Halloween night, shadows creep out of sight
Pumpkins glow with faces bright, underneath the pale moonlight
Halloween, Halloween, can you hear the silence scream?
Things aren't always as they seem, ain't no whispering autumn's gleam
Children laughing all around
Trick or treat is the only sound
Costumes and masks are all around
In every house and on the ground
Halloween, Halloween
When the ghouls convene
In the reflection of the moonbeam
Do you dare to join the Halloween scene?
Candy and sweets, add to this night's delight
While witches take the midnight flight
Beware of what lurks out of sight
On this eerie Halloween night
Halloween, Halloween, listen to the night's doreen
Creeping slow in keys is the spirit of Halloween
As the stars bid us goodbye
Halloween will always mystify
Until next year when once again we'll try
To uncover the secrets of Halloween night
