I've got a desperate motion
To be your soul devotion
A subtle self-diffuse
A little secret potion
To put my plan in motion
In just a hint of rouge
But I'll look at us in a Cinderella
I'll leave a smile outside
To spin my web
Even though a part of you expects me
To spin my web
Even when it caught you all suspectly
I'm with you when you're wide awake
And when you're on the edge
Touch the edge of your dreams, a spinner wheel
A percolating rhythm has always been that something you never could resist
You let the feelings simmer
But in your eyes that glimmer
Says you don't get the chance
You try to dance away the heartache
But you cannot escape
Well, I spin my web
Even though a part of you expects me
To spin my web
And even when you're caught you won't suspect me
I'm with you when you're wide awake
And when you're on the edge
The edge of your dreams
I swim away
You're almost a driver, hit and run
But you're dear when it warms
Spin my web and even though
A part of you expects me to spin my web
And even when you're caught you won't suspect me
To spin my web and even though
A part of you expects me to spin my
And even when you're caught you won't suspect
