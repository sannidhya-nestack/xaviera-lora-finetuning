On Halloween's eve when night grows cold
In witch's house where spirits are told
Clouds where tangling shadows creep
While the golden bears the spirits weep
Round the fire we dance and sing
Summoning the dark the night does bring
Bats take flight and owls call
As the witch's house casts its spell on all
In the dead of night, hear the ghostly moans
Amid the graves and the ancient stones
Jack-o'-lanterns gleam with a sinister grin
The witch's house invites you in
The wind howls through the creeping vines
Echoes of the past in haunting lines
Skeletons rattle and whispers grow
In the witch's house where few dare go
The moon's eve when light grows cold
In witch's house where secrets are told
Cards hanged and shadows creep
While the golden borders of spirits weave
Round the fire we dance and sing
Summoning the dark the night does break
Bats take flight and owls call
As the witch's house casts its spell on all
In the dead of night, hear the ghostly moans
Amid the graves and the ancient stones
Jack-o'-lanterns gleam with a sinister grin
The witch's house invites you in
The wind howls through the creeping vines
Echoes of the past in haunting lines
Skeletons rattle and whispers grow
In the witch's house, where few dare go
The hauntings eve when the light grows cold
In which his house where secrets are told
Conwebs hang and shadows creep
While the cold boils the secrets weep
