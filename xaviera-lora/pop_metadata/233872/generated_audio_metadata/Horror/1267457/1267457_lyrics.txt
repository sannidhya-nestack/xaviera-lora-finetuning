Oh, I like to be different
And start the house away from them
The shadows tall and windows thin
The witches live on Halloween
Spooky nights and haunting fights
Witches brew and ghostly lights
Festive thrills on Halloween eve
In the witch's house you must believe
The dark serpent whispers ah
Goblins dance along the wall
Hear the strucker, darkness creeps
In the witch's house, no soul sleeps
Spooky nights and haunting fright
Witches brew and ghostly lights
Festive thrills on Halloween eve
In the witch's house you must believe
Blackest island, owls do root
From the cauldron, smells of loot
Spirits moan, and shadows weep
On Halloween, the dead achieve
Spooky nights and haunting fright
Witches brew and ghostly lights
Festive thrills on Halloween eve
In the witch's house you must believe
A chilling laugh, a spell is cast
Into the witch's spell at last
Skeletons dance, ankles will roll
In the witch's house no one grows old
Spooky nights and haunting farts
Witches brew and ghostly lights
Festive thrills on Halloween Eve
In the witch's house you must believe
Also hear this tale when nightly falls
You can hear the witches and the shit calls
On Halloween the spirits wake
In the witch's house your soul felt take
