In the forest deep and dark
With the moon that left its mark
Stands a house that time ot
Where the witch we spell and plot
On Halloween Eve the shadows dance
A chilling wind of ghostly trance
Jack-o'-lanterns burning bright
Guide lost souls through the night
Spooky night, witch's flight
Underneath the pale moonlight
Enter if you dare to see
The witch's haunting symphony
Cobwebs draped on every door
Creeping whispers ancient lore
Candles flicker, spirits sway
As the witch begins her play
From her cauldron smoke does rise
