Vampires and werewolves thirsting for blood
Hunting on Halloween night
Ghouls and green goblins and brain eating zombies
Are watching us with hungry eyes
Foul smelling demons are scheming and dreaming
Of having a scrumptious feast
Only food on the menu is salted and fondued
Pieces of you and me
Ooh, keep telling yourself it's the way
If you don't, you'll crawl out of your skin
While witches with rabies are stirring the gravy
Spiders are spinning their webs
They'll wrap us like mummies'til we're juicy and yummy
And serve us alive to the dead
So this Halloween as you walk down the street
Keep looking over your shoulder
All they crave is a bite
But if you die from fright you won't get another day older
Ooh, that sound is getting too close
Ooh, I think it's time to run home
Sharp fangs and claws might leave you gory
But the end of this story is clear
If you wake up in November, you're safe
But remember, you might not be so lucky next year
