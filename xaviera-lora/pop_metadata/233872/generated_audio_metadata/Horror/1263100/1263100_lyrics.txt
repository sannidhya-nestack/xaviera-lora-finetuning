In the shadows grip beneath the moon's pale light
Haunted whispers echoing through the spectral night
In the castle's heart where the secrets lie
Dark illusions dance under an ominous sky
Oh, the silent symphony plays a score of mystery
Songs of the otten lore drawn from ghostly store
Shadows waltz and spirits roam in this chilling timeless dome
Lost in echoes of the past are hallowed verses cast
In the arches of the past where spectres sway
Amongst the statues carved in stone silent in their play
A rose of black in the garden thrives
Caught in the moonbeams that grow where the darkness comes alive
Oh, the silent symphony
Blissful tales of history
Bound by chains of ancient spells
In the toll of graveyard bells
In our grand and haunted home
Watch the wraiths as they do roll
Lost beneath the cogwhed spell
Hear the tolling midnight bell
Midnight girl, midnight love
As the shadows curtain falls, night takes her reign
Within the darkness haunting grip, we dance in her domain
On a stage of twilight dreams
Where the night holds her caught
The lost spent time caught in
