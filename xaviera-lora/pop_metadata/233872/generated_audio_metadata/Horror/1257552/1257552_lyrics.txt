Underneath the moon so bright
The apple engines give off light
Winds are howling through the night
It's all hallows, we hold on tight
Halloween, Halloween
Ghosts and ghouls on the scene
Trick or treat, don't be mean
On this night of Halloween
Witch's spoons cut through the air
Spooky spirits everywhere
Haunted houses, dare you dare?
On this night when all the monsters care
Halloween, Halloween
Bats and cauldrons on the screen
Costumes on, let's make a scene
On this night of Halloween
The handy corn and toffee apple
Hide and seek at the haunted chapel
Skeletons rattle in gates of lapple
It's Halloween's special raffle
Halloween, Halloween
