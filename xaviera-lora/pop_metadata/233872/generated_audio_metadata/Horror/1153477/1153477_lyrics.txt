It's creeping up on midnight
Everybody's looking super fly
On the dance floor'neath the hollow sky
Full moon shining on us
The time is upon us
To bust out the moves that terrify
It's a monster party, oh whoa whoa
It's a monster party, oh whoa whoa
Anything goes in the shadows of the night
It's a monster party, oh woah woah
It's a monster party, oh woah woah
In the name of the game, it's staying alive
Demons shrieking in the graveyard
Break dancing to the break of dawn
Mesmerized like moss drawn to a flame
Grim Reaper is the MC
Rockin' out with the zombies
The skeletons back to the bone in a Congo train
It's a monster party, oh whoa whoa
It's a monster party, oh whoa whoa
Anything goes in the shadows of the night
It's a monster party, oh woah woah
It's a monster party, oh woah woah
In the name of the game, it's staying alive
The living dead are getting down
You can hear their cold hearts pound
To the rhythm of a bassline, got in the groove
Witches rappin' alongside the mummies
The trolls and the ghoulies can't keep from hummin'
Song after song while they're raising the roof
It's a monster party, oh-woah-woah
It's a monster party, oh-woah, woah
Anything goes in the shadows of the night
It's a master party, oh woah woah
It's a master party, oh woah woah
In the name of the game, it's staying alive
It's creeping up on midnight
Everybody looking to fly on the dance floor
a hollowed sky
I'm all alone, I'm all alone, I'm all alone
