In the still moonlit night where shadows thrive
Through vanished echoes our tale arrives
Under the gloom of the haunted skies
Beware the Veltrick's world now dies
In whispers low where the cold wind blows
Unseen hands play symphonies of woes
From the ancient tombs and the catacombs
Hear the muted cry of otten tones
The stone archways of crumbling designs
Inch by inch, a creeping mind twines
In hidden corners of the castle keep
The old secret silently weep
Through the grand halls, down the hollow lanes
Of the land steeped in sorrow over dental pains
The drip of time, the echo of a chime
Tell the ghostly tale in a sinister rhyme
In whispers low where the cold wind blows
Unseen hands play symphonies of woes
From the ancient tombs and the catacombs
Hear the muted cry of otten tones
Through the grand halls, down the hollow lanes
Of a land steeped in sorrow and untold pains
The drip of time, the echo of a chime
Tell the ghostly tale in a sinister rhyme
The wind howls down the hollow lanes of a land
Seeked in sorrow, a wet little place
The trip of time, the echo of a chime
Tell the ghostly tale in a sinister rhyme
Who ends why life falls and the shadows grow
In the low light of the candles glow
Remember well this macabre scene
And tread softly this coming Halloween
