Underneath the pale moonlight, ghouls and ghosts own the night
Pumpkins grinning ear to ear, Halloween time is here
It's a night full of fright, costume sight
Creeping out under spooky light
Trick or treat, high-pitched scream, it's time for Halloween
Shadows cast a haunting spell
In the night where monsters dwell
Witches brew and black cats yell
In the charm of Halloween's bell
It's a night full of fright
Costumes tight
Creeping out under the spooky light
Trick or treat
High pitched scream
It's all about Halloween
It's a night full of fright, costumes tight
Creeping out under the spooky light
Trick or treat, high pitched scream
It's all about Halloween
Gather close, hold your breath
In this dance with playful death
Mystery lurks'til the dawn's beam
In the heart of Halloween's bell
It's a night full of fright
All is right
Underneath the eerie moonlight
Laughter screams, it's our favorite thing
Embrace the spirit of Halloween
Ooh-wee
Ooh-wee
As the clock strikes midnight's ring
We dance away the delightful pain
next year we'll again convene
For the magic of Halloween
Halloween
Halloween
