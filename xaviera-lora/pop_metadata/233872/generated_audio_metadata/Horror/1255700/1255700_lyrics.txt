Once a year there comes a night
When the pumpkins are aglow with light
Costumes on, we're ready to play
Halloween, hip hip hooray
Halloween, Halloween, oh what fun
Trick or treat everyone under the moon and sun
Halloween, Halloween, so much to see
Spooky ghouls and witches all dancing with glee
Knock, knock, who's there a surprise?
Candies and sweets, oh my, oh my
Jack-o'-lanterns light up the way
On this spooky magical day
Halloween, Halloween, a friendly fight
Laughter and joy fill the night
Halloween, Halloween is here at last
Make memories that forever last
So sing this song with all your might
In the Halloween soft, sweet night
Wave goodbye as the day is done
Halloween is loved by everyone
Halloween, Halloween, oh what fun
Trick or treat everyone
Under the moon and sun
Halloween, Halloween, so much to see
Spooky ghouls and witches all dancing with glee
Knock, knock, who's there? A surprise
Candies and sweets, oh my, oh my, oh my
Jack the lanterns light up the way
On this spooky magical day
Knock knock who's there
A surprise candies and sweets
Oh my oh my
Jack-o'-lanterns light up the way
On this spooky magical day
On this spooky magical day
So sing this song with all your might
In the Halloween soft sweet night
Wave goodbye as the day is done
Halloween is loved by everyone
