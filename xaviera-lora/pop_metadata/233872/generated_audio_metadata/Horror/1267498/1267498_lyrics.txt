Oh, spirit glow, oh, what a night so dark
Whispering shadows, the night to embark
Cobwebs and pumpkins, a house on a hill
Where witches weave spells with their spine chilling thrill
Knock on the door, creak it goes wide
Enter the lair where the spirits reside
Candles flicker when the ghosts be played
Summoning whispers they call out your name
Under the cowl of Halloween Eve
Old witches cackle, no chance to reprieve
In the cauldron secrets simmer and boil
