Morning lights so dark and dreary
When the moon is ghostly pale
Through the shadows creeping eerie
Hark the witch's ghoulish wail
There's a house atop the hillside
With its windows black as coal
Where the witches stir their cauldron
Stirring spells to steal a soul
Ooh, can you hear them whisper?
Ooh, ooh, feel the shadows shiver
Ooh, ooh, in the witch's house tonight
Pumpkins burning, candles flicker
Casting faces on the wall
Spiders weaving webs much thicker
Down the eerie endless hall
Past the graveyard, past the willow
Where the haunting spectres weep
Lies the witch's house so hallowed
Where the wrestlers never sleep
Ooh, can you hear them whisper?
Ooh, ooh, feel the shadows shiver
Ooh, ooh, in the witch's house tonight
Skeletons begin their dancing
the autumn's crimson leaves
Phantom figures softly chatting
On this haunted all-hallows eve
So beware ye festive wanderers
As the witch's house draws near
For within its walls of sorcery
Lies your deepest darkest fear
Ooh, can you hear them whisper?
Ooh, ooh, feel the shadows shiver
Ooh, ooh, in the witch's house tonight
Candles dim and shadows lengthen
As the midnight hour chimes
Voices in the darkness strengthen
With their ancient, eerie rhymes
Ooh, can you hear them whisper?
