I heard spooky rapping, a rat-tat-tapping
I didn't know what to do
My fear kept growing, so I went tippy-toeing
Then I heard a ghost yell "Boo !"
My blood began to thicken, told myself don't be a chicken
Though I could have rung right then
I saw he looked lonely, knew he'd feel good
If only I would hug him like a friend
Have you hugged a ghost today? It's right out of this world
Have you hugged a ghost today? It'll make your straight hair curl
Don't be a fuddy-duddy, you might make another party
Have you hugged a ghost today?
My heart gets all thumpy, my skin is goose-bumpy whenever we get close
My belly starts to quiver though, he gives me icy shivers
I really love that ghost
Have you hugged a ghost today? It's right out of this world
Have you hugged a ghost today? It'll make your straight hair curl
Don't be a buddy-duddy, you might make another buddy
Have you hugged a ghost today?
It's frightful yet delightful
When you help a ghost in need
It's chilling yet thrilling
Satisfaction guaranteed
Have you hugged a ghost today? It's right out of this world
Have you hugged a ghost today? It'll make your straight hair curled
Don't be a funny donny, you might make another body
Have you hugged a ghost today?
