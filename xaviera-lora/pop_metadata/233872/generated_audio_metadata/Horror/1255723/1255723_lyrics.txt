Halloween, Halloween, a spooky night so keen
Ghosts whispering, bats fluttering, what a Halloween scene
Pumpkins glowing, winds are blowing, oh what a frightful delight
Costumes on, the moon is strong in the crisp cool October night
Trick or treat, smell my feet
Give me something good to eat
Riches, ghouls and black cats too
A haunted night just for you
We will stroll under a moon's glow
On this Halloween night
Off we go
Down the street with bags so sweet
Candies, chocolates allure
Knocking doors, footsteps on floors
Cackle and a roar
With a boo we might scare you
But it's all in good fun
In this enchanting Halloween night
Oh, the excitement has just begun
Trick or treat, smell my feet
Give me something good to eat
Monster skeletons and creepy crawly bugs
In our Halloween costumes tight
We snuck with every knock as the time tick-tocks
In this Halloween joy we're around the clock
As the night ends with our friends under the twinkling stars
We recount our spooky tales near and far
Halloween, Halloween, so much fun it's been
Can't wait for next year to do it all over again
Trick or treat, smell my feet
Give me something good to eat
Monster skeletons and a creepy crawly bug
In our roar, in our Halloween costumes tight
