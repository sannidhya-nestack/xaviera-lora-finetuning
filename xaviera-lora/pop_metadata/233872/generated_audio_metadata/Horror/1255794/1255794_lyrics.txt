It's Halloween, a time of delight
Ghosts and ghouls come out at night
We wear our costumes, oh so neat
And head outside to trick or treat
Halloween, Halloween, full of fun
Gathering treats and candies by the ton
Witches, cats, and big-eyed bats
Even some pumpkins wearing hats
We knock on doors and ring the bells
In our favorite fairy tales dwells
Trick or treat, we call with glee
Under the moon as happy as can be
Halloween, Halloween, don't be shy
Spooky spirits flying high
Blossom screams fill the air
Oh Halloween, beyond compare
Goodnight Halloween, time to rest
You really are the very best
We'll dream of all the fun and cheer
Until you come again next year
Halloween, Halloween, full of fun
Gathering treats and candies by the ton
Witches, cats, and big-eyed bats
Even some pumpkins wearing hats
We knock on doors in a wing
Halloween, don't be shy
Spooky spirits flying high
Lost in screams, feel the air
Oh Halloween, beyond compare
One night Halloween, time to rest
You really are the very best
We'll dream of all the fun and cheer
Until you come again next year
