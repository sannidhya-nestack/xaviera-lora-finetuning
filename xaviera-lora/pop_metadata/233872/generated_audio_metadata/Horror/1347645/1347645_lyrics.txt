The floorboards sigh with restless breaths
The step that isn't mine
The shadows crawl with silent dread
A messenger's sign
I hear the whispers in the hall
A name I've never known
A face appears in shattered glass
On a throne of dust and stone
The air grows cold
The door slams shut
A chilling final sound
This house has secrets in its bones
Buried in hallowed ground
And now I'm not alone, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
And now I'm not alone
The mirror holds a stranger's gaze
A fate that won't untwine
It holds my soul, it holds my past
And now my mind is mine
