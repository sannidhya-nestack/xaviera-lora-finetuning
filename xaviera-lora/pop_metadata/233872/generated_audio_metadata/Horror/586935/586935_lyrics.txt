Can't you feel the hate?
Can't you feel the hate?
Can't you feel the hate?
Can't you feel the hate?
I wanna be compromised
I wanna be categorized
To fit in the civilized
But every second passes by reminds me hate in mind
I wanna feel criticized
I wanna feel synchronized
Just to be neutralized
But every second passes by remains a hated fight
We want the hated mind
We want the hated mind
We want the hated mind
Hated mind
We want the hated mind
We want the hated mind
We want the hated mind
The hate in my mind
