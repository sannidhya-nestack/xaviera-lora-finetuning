I hate evening rainbows
Where shadows dance in a haunted moon
A witch's house smells lovely
Where whispers of secrets murmur again
Candles flicker and the windows hide
As ghosts and ghouls begin to rise
Through the cobwebbed halls
Footsteps fall, echoes of laughter's central call
Oh Halloween, oh Halloween night
Witches cackle, spirits take fright
In the dark of the moon, on the stars they rewrite
The witch's house glows with affright
Kitchen, cauldron bubbles green
A potion for tricks so sly and mean
Black cats pearl the rusted sill
As jack-o'-lanterns guard the hill
Creaking doors, wicked spells
Mysteries that no tongue tells
Through the garden, nightshade booms
Underneath the silver-edged spoon
On Halloween, on Halloween night
Witches cackle, spirits seek flight
In the dark of the moon, under stars' eerie light
The witch's house glows with a fright
Up the stairs to the attic above
Where bats and spiders meet in love
A dusty book of old enchant
Pages turned by hands faint
Beware, beware of the witch's snare
Her secrets held in moonlit air
On all hallows eve, treads soft and sly
For those who enter may not say goodbye
Oh Halloween, oh Halloween night
Witches cackle, spirits take flight
In the dark of the moon, on the stars they rewrite
The witch's house glows with affright
As the clock strikes twelve, the magic binds
With every tick of the rhythm unwinds
So join the dance of shadows and dreams
In the witch's house where the nightmare teems
Oh Halloween, oh Halloween night
Witches' cackled spirits seek fright
In the dark of the moon on the stars' eerie lights
The witch's house glows with a fright
Oh Halloween, oh Halloween night
In the witch's house, beware the witch's house
In the witch's house tonight
