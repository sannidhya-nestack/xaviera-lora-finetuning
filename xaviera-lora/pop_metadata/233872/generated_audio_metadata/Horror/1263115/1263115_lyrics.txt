In the depth of the night under the hollows veil
The echoes of the symphony tell a haunting tale
Under moon silver gleam through the fog and the drizzle
Whispers of otten lore play a tune that sizzle
Ooh, welcome to the night serenade
The soft refrain, the shadows have played
In this realm where the dusk has strayed
Feel the chill, but don't be afraid
A spectre in the corner
A silhouette in lace
How the shadows dance
In this chilling embrace
On the cobblestone paths
Where black roses bloom
The sound of the night
Carries a pleasant doom
Ooh, heed the night's intriguing charade
Set upon the grand stage, the darkness has laid
By the ghostly parade, be not dismayed
In the heart's vault, this melody has forever stayed
Through the arches, gothic down the otten aisle
The phantom sings softly the ballad of the exile
On the strings of the harp they strum an eerie song
In the deathly silent night they serve a disturbing call
So sleep tight in the absence of light
As the curtain falls on this dreadful night
The dirge has been sung with all its might
In the theater of dreams your fears ignite
