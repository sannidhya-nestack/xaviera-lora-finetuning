In the night there's an eerie fright
Ghosts and ghouls dancing in the moonlight
Through the pumpkin field we take our flight
Heart pounding in the cold crisp night
Halloween, when the unseen can be seen
Night of fright, full of delight
Put on your masks, join the twilight dance
In this mysterious Halloween romance
Shadows creep while the world's asleep
In the town of fright, secrets will keep
Witches fly across the moon-soaked
In this tale where nightmares seek
Halloween, night of the mystic dream
In costumes we blend, with spirits we befriend
Time for a scare, thrills in the air
This is Halloween, nothing can compare
As midnight strikes
Feel the dread spikes
Halloween's magic like whimsical trikes
So here we celebrate
As the lanterns illuminate
In the haunting charm
Of this October date
