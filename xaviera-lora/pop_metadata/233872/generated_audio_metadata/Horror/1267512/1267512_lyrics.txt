In a town by the twisted wood
Stands a house where once none stood
Where the shadows seem to sigh
And the owls and ravens cry
Wicked winds through branches weave
On a chilling Hallows Eve
By the hearth the witches brew
A potion made for me and you
Ooh, in a house so cold and gory
Ghostly whispers tell a story
Candles flicker, darkness swells
Weaving ancient, eerie spells
Midnight chimes, the ritual starts
Curse the land with haunted hearts
Creaking floors and whispers fate
A spectral priest to mourn the saints
Moonlight seeps through cracked windows
Spectral silence no one knows
Spiders weave their silken thread
Over paths where witches tread
Ooh, in a house so cold and gory
Ghostly whispers tell a story
Candles flicker, darkness swells
Weaving ancient, eerie spells
Children's laughter in the air
Echoes lost in deep despair
Cobweb laces, dust and gloom
Shadows dance in every room
In this place where time does freeze
Join the waltz among the trees
Dance until the break of day
With the spirits cold and grey
Ooh, in a house so cold and grey
