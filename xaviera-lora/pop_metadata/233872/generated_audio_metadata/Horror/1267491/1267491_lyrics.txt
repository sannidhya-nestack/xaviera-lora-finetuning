Loony haunted hollow
Where the midnight shadows follow
There stands a house of eerie splendor
Where the witches cast their wonder
Broken whispers, ghostly glows
the witches' house they flow
On this dark and frightful Halloween
Secrets whisper long unseen
God will place the ancient archways
Candles flicker shadows play
Bats deep flight in moonlit skies
With a cackle and a chilling cry
Wrecking whispers, ghostly glows
the witch's house they flow
On this dark and frightful Halloween
Secrets whisper long unseen
Cauldron bubbling, potions brewing
Spells and curses, mischief stewing
Jack-o'-lanterns cast their grin
As the spirits rise within
Wicked whispers, ghostly glows
On the witch's house they flow
On this dark and frightful Halloween
Secret, long unseen
Children giggle, footsteps creeping
Witches bruise through night air sweeping
Ghosts and ghouls join in the fray
Dancing to the haunted lay
Kicking whispers ghostly glows
a witch's house they flow
On this dark and frightful Halloween
Secrets whisper long unseen
So beware on Halloween Eve
In the shadows to believe
For the witch's house of yore
Holds dark tales forevermore
Vivid whispers, ghostly glows on the witch's house they flow on this darkened floor
