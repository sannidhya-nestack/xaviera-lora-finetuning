In a dark and dreary town
Where goblins creep and ghosts are found
There's a house on the under hill
With eerie lights that haunt and thrill
On a misty Halloween eve
When shadows leap and none believe
The witch's laughter fills the air
Engendering a chilling scare
Oh, the witch's hat and the black cat's fur
The wind's cold whisper as the moonlight blurs
In the spooky house where the candles gleam
Be wary, my dear, it's a Halloween dream
Through the fog and twisted trees
Hear the banshee's mournful pleas
Jack-o'-lanterns grin with gloom
In the witch's darkened room
Spiders spin their webs of fright
Bats take wing into the night
Yet she brews her potions deep
Awakening secrets long asleep
Oh, the witch's hat and the black cat's fur, the wind's cold
