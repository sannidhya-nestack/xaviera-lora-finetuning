To the heart of midnight
Where the spectres dwell
In streets glazed by moonlight
Under the ancient spell
The wind sings hymns of a otten past
In the realm of shadows where their chill is cast
Unseen in the daylight
In the mirth they dance
Enchantments whispered under the moon's glass
Untethered spirits in their ghostly france
In the silent ballad of the night's expanse
Among the veiled corners of the echoing hall
The candle flames flicker, casting an ethereal sprawl
Ghoulish echoes of a haunting call
In the theatre of whispers where the banshees enthrall
In a world hidden by the shroud of the night
Awakening under the veiled stars
