In the realm where shadows dance
Near as cold as icy lands
Underneath the blood-red moon so pale
Whispers heard beneath the veil
Through spectral halls we bravely tread
In the silence nightmares fed
In the night where horror's dead
In the grip of chill despair
See the castle, dark and grand
Rising high on cursed land
Ghosts that wail in mournful tune
A symphony for the lost and school
In the echo of the scream
Fear is more than it may seem
In the depths where shadows hide
Lost souls forever trapped inside
Cold, dark, we dance with dread
Impass'd with a mortal threat
The echoes of a haunted host
Echoes from the lonely coast
Now the night draws to its close
Leaving us in sweet repose
In the darkness where nightmares lay
Until the dawning of the day
The castle dark and grand
Rising high on cursed land
Ghosts that wail in mournful tune
A symphony for the lost and swoon
In the echo of the scream
Fear is more than it may seem
In the depths where shadows hide
Lost souls forever trapped inside
Hold and fight
Oh dark we dance with dread
In paths where no mortal tread
