It's Halloween, it's Halloween, time for fun not to be mean
Dress up in your spooky vest and go on a trick or treat quest
Halloween, oh Halloween, the best night that's ever been
Full of fun and lots of fright, let's celebrate Halloween night
Bats and cats and pumpkins too
Monsters on your bed to say goo
Candy corn and caramel apple
Let's dress up and go to the castle
Halloween, oh Halloween
In your costumes you'll be seen
Ghosts and goblins, witches too
All are out to come see you
So let's sing, dance and trick or treat until the night is finally complete
Halloween, oh Halloween, best night of the year to be seen
It's Halloween, it's Halloween
Time for fun, not to be mean
Dress up in your spooky best
And go on a trick or treat quest
Halloween, oh Halloween
The best night that's ever been
Full of fun and lots of fright
Let's celebrate Halloween night
Bats and cats and pumpkins too
Monsters under your bed to say poo
Candy corn and caramel apple
Let's dress up and go to the castle
Halloween, oh Halloween
In your costumes you'll be seen
Ghosts and goblins, witches too
All are out to come see you
So let's sing, dance, and trick or treat
Until the night is finally complete
Halloween, oh Halloween
Best night of the year to be seen
