The forest's dark where the witch's house stands
The mist is the purest rose in the haunted lands
On the rainy evening, spirits rise free
Dancing through the shadows'neath the old oak tree
Ooh, the witch's pearl is sipping
In the cauldron, quick and dripping
Underneath the moon, pale and bright
On this chilly, eerie night
Showing in their costumes, masks on tight
Sitting cautiously, sunken front
Laughter mixes with their cries
As they see the glow in the witch's eyes
The lanterns glow, the ghosts sit strong
Pumpkins grinning, standing alone
Cowards hang from every door
In the witch's house on the forest floor
Ooh, the witch's brew is sippin'
In the cauldron, quick and drippin'
Underneath the moon, pale and bright
On this chilly, eerie night
Black cats hurl with eyes so clean
Whirls howlin' at a sight unseen
That's feathered in the midnight air
While pumpkins dribble in the square
Pink shadows twist and creep
As the witch transformed her key
Spells are cast and phantoms call
In this eerie festive hall
Ooh, the witch's brew is sipping
In the cauldron quick and dripping
Underneath the moon pale and bright
On this chilly, eerie night
the haunted house we go
Where the wings of our souls broke the glow
Stories told of spooks and ghouls
Where the witch's magic rules
Journey's steep and the journey's strange
In a place from where you'll find the edge
Cross-clad, opened by unseen hands
In this eerie festive land
Ooh, the witch's pool is sipping
In the cauldron quick and dripping
Underneath the moon pale and bright
On this chilly, eerie night
So gather close, let's share the fright
In the witch's house on this spooky night
Where tales of old and magic soar
And shadows dance forevermore
Ooh, the witch's brood is sinking
In the cauldron quick and dripping
Underneath the moon pale and bright
On this chilly, eerie night
