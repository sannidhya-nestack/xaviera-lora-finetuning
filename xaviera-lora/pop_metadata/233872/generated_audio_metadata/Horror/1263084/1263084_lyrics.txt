Underneath the moonless sky
Where spectres find delight
Lies a tale of mystery
In the cool of the night
Through cobweb corridors
Whispers from unseen
Set the stage for mystery
Within a phantom sea
Trickling time, oh fleeting chime
A waltz beneath the veil of eerie grime
Gathered at the crypt's door
Shadows cast and twist
In the heart of the timeless night
Where light does not exist
The haunted silence
Filled with ancient dread
