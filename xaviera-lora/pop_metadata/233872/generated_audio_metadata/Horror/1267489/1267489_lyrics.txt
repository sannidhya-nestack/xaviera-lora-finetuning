As the moonlight casts its eerie glow
To the witch's house we dare to go
Through the fog that whispers tales untold
Where the shadows dance both young and old
On Halloween Eve the
Spirits rise underneath the haunted, starless skies
The wind it howls a bone-chilling breeze
Stirring whispers through the twisted trees
Witches brew and a crooked grin
A fest of fright begins within
Candles flicker with a ghostly gleam
Muttering spells in the midnight steam
Black cats prance on the cobblestone
Lost souls murmur flesh and bone
Cauldron secrets steep
Mysteries of the night she'll keep
