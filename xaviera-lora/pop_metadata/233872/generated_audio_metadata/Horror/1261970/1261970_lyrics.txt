In the dark room of the house of the night
Underneath the cursed moon's pale light
Skeletons and trees and heroes they will be born
As Harry, Batman and Halloween Eve
The end of Halloween
Emerges in the night unseen
That's not real
This must have been a child's dream
Where haunted secrets silently seemed
Ghosts and balloons began to gleam
In the heart of this Diamond Halloween
Dark and hollowly
Open in a ghostly dream
Quiet tales of love
It's dark and it's Halloween
