Walking down the pumpkin lane
Children's laughter, it's Halloween again
Doorbells ringing as shadows wane
What frightening fun in the autumn rain
Ghouls and witches on the prowl
Owls and demons starting to howl
Through the darkness they scowl
It's Halloween night, feel the chill
Hear the growl
Halloween, oh Halloween
It's playfully mean
A world of magic yet unseen
In costumes leaping on a moonlight beam
It's full of fright
This Halloween night dream
Candies collected in buckets they gleam
Little monsters in the street
From door to door with a scary theme
What a hauntingly sweet Halloween treat
In the midnight hour ghosts convene
The moonlight flickers with a silver sheen
Creating such a supernatural scene
Of Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
Full of mystery and sheen
An enchanted knight
Fit for a queen
Through the night
Let's careen
In fantastical fright
This Halloween night dream
As dawn chases away the moonlight gleam
And the whimsical knight
Loses its scream
Halloween fades like a half-remembered dream
Until next year, Happy Halloween!
