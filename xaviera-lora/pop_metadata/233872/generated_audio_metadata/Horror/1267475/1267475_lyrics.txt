Deep in the shadow of the moon on Halloween Eve
There's a tale struck in fear that few dare believe
Where the owls hoot at dusk through the mist-laden air
Lies the witch's old house with a dark chilling glare
Through the forest so deep where the branches do creep
Lies a pathway so steep guarded secrets to keep
There's a cauldron that bubbles with a green ghastly glow
As the firelight flickers casting shadows below
Round and round the broomsticks fly
Underneath the inky sky
Witches cackle, ghosts they sigh
A symphony of sweet chilling fright
In the witch's dread den where the dark things are slept
Lives a legend of spectres of souls that she's kept
With a book made of skin and words inked in dread
She conjures old spirits from realms of the dead
Skeletal hands
Play the bones in eerie tuned drones
And the black cats do sing in harmonic groans
Jack-o'-lanterns alight, their grins wicked bright
Pierce the veil of the night with a mischievous delight
Round and round the broomsticks fly
Underneath the inky sky
