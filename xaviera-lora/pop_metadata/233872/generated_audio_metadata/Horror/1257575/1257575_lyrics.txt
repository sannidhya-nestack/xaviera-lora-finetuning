Halloween, Halloween
Ghouls cry in the night's light
Children laugh and monsters roar
Creatures of the dark take flight
Skeletons rattle their bones
Witches chant their tolls
Step inside if you dare
Into the unknown
Halloween
Can you hear the wolves howl or the phantoms shriek?
Come and join the fun tonight, it's the mystique we seek
Cobwebs on the corners, shadows at the door
Keep your trick or treat bag close, you're about to score
Ghosts waltzing in the halls, spiders climb the walls
Tales of fright and eerie sights at the haunted halls
Halloween, Halloween
Whispering in the breeze
the corner what to see
It's a hoard of zombie bees
Through the mist and the fog under the bat's wing
Let's celebrate this chilling night
Let the dark enchant let's sing
As the night comes to a close
The sun begins to rise
Keep the memories of this thrill until next year's ghostly disguise
Halloween, oh Halloween
Halloween
Day of thrill and scare
Until your spooky charm returns
We bid you sweet nightmare
We bid you sweet nightmare
