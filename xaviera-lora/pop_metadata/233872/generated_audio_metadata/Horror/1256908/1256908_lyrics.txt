Beware, beware, all on Hallow's Eve
Scary creatures come out to deceive
The moon is high, in darkness we believe
Tonight's the time for Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
Night to fight and scream
Costumes on, fantasies to dream
Candy bags full to the brim
Everything is not as it seems
Ghosts whispering in the dead of the night
Jack-o'-lanterns flickering with delight
Beware of the shadows causing fright
As we dance under the silver moonlight
Halloween, Halloween, creatures never before seen
Eerie laughter, echoes in between
Trick or treat, let's make a scene
On this mystic night of Halloween
When all the fun and games are done Remember the thrill and all the fun
