The street lights flicker
The shadows stretch
A figure walks without a sound
No boots on pavement
No whispered speech
Just silent watch on hallowed ground
The doors are locked, the blinds are drawn
The pumpkin's candle starts to wane
He sees the children safe from harm
But watches through the windowpane
He carries no bag, he wants no treat
Just walks the night from house to house
With measured steps on silent feet
Quiet as a hungry mouse
He's watching, waiting in the dark (he's watching)
The air grows cold, the moment lingers
Leaving no trace, no single mark
A cold dread touches with his fingers
The dogs don't bark, the cats don't run
The world ets to make a sound
His chilling journey's just begun
As he moves across the haunted town
He is no ghost, no mask he wears
Just ancient eyes that see it all
He simply watches and he stares
Before he answers his dark call
He's watching, waiting in the dark
He's watching, the air grows cold
The moment lingers
Leaving no trace, no single mark
A cold dread touches with his fingers
(Siren)
You feel his gaze, your breath grows thin
A shiver that you can't explain
It settles deep beneath your skin
Like a cold and creeping rain
He passes by
You feel his presence leave
But he'll be back
On another eve
