(electronic buzzing)
It's spooky outside and there's goblins in the trees
It's Halloween night and it's you that's haunting me
The fire's burning hot and the cauldron is a bubble
And it looks like you and I are in some trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Come down out of the tree, don't you be a scaredy-cat
You're not here again, all because of this and that
There's too much on your plate, and what's left is always me
And here I am again, all alone on Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
You're too hot to handle and I'm too cold to hold
Keep your bag of candy'cause we're out of control
We're out of control
You think just'cause I care that I'm some old wicked witch
We're at a zombie crawl'cause we've got a ghostly glitch
Just like candy is, wish you'd be a little sweeter
You're here and then you're gone just like a trick or treater (trick or treater, trick or treater, trick or treater, trick or treater)
You're too hot to handle and I'm too cold to hold
Keep your bag of candy'cause we're all out of control (we're all out of control)
If you take off your mask you'll see it's you I love the most
I'll be your pumpkin girl and you can stop the inner ghost
I don't mean to howl or to scare you to a leap
It's a creepy monstrous fact you got spooked this Halloween
You're stuck in the dark shadows on this Halloween
So don't be supernatural'cause you are ghosting me (you are ghosting) me
