On this night of Halloween beat
Cobwebs glisten in the muted light as shadows take flight
Candy laughter and chills of fright fill the cool night
Beware the creatures that give you a start out of sight
It's the magic and mystery'til the morning's first light
Candy corn pumpkins shorn
From dusk'til the morn
Ghost zombies reborn
On this night of Halloween sworn
Shadows lengthen, whispers tighten
Halloween has begun
Witches cackling, specters gathering
Under the rising moon
When the midnight bell tolls, echoing in the soul
We'll remember this is Halloween, where the unliving stroll
