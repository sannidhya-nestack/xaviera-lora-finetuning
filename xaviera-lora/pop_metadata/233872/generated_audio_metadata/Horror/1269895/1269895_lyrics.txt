And at times shadows play
Have you seen jack-o-lanterns, hey?
With a grin so white and bright
Wonders round on Halloween night
Creeping through the fog so thick
Holding candles, playing tricks
Laughing low and cackling mean
Strangest thing you've ever seen
How do you say you're going to go
Through the streets with your ego?
Broken hand and all aglow
Smoking hands, a freaky show
In the park or down the lane
Chicks and tricks they entertain
Watch your step don't lose your way
Jack-o-lanterns out to play
Laughing friends they join and stare
Funny mess and crazy hair
Dance till dawn and disappear
Catch them now for they won't reappear
Have you seen Jack O'Lantern go?
Do the streets look very cool?
Pumpkinhead and Oakwood
Spooky and so freaky show
