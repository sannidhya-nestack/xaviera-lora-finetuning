Midnight shroud, shadows dance and twirl
In the depth of the night, under the moon's pearls
The eerie whispers of an olden tale
Is the haunted mansion down the dismal trail
Apart from the no-tolls
Fear unites its whole
Halloween spirits, cries and stories
Of old unfold
In the symphony of whispers
Bathed in a chilling cold night
Echoes with the chap that's
Eerie tales are told
The seraphine of sleep
In the labyrinth of shadows, weak stories to deceive
The autumn wind howls in the ominously silent night
Ghostly apparitions in flight, stirring dreadful fright
The silhouette of the raving Christ
Moose-veiled light in the labyrinth of the night
