Hey, hey, hey, it's Halloween day
We dress up and play in a magical way
With a hat and a cape, a ghost or an ape
Hooray for Halloween day
Halloween, Halloween, so much fun
Trick or treat until the day is done
Pumpkins glowing bright in the night, ooh
Spooky Halloween, what a sight
Knock on the door, trick or treat we say
We gather candies, then off we sway
Witches, goblins and bats are here
Don't be scared, Halloween is here
Halloween, Halloween, it's so cool
Candy and costumes roll
So let's sing and hop under the moon
Halloween is here, it'll be bedtime soon
Halloween, Halloween, now it's time to dream
Of a world full of candy and a moonbeam
Halloween, Halloween, a magical night
We'll see you next year, oh what a delight!
Halloween, Halloween, so much fun
Trick or treating'til the day is done
Pumpkins glowing bright in the night
Ooh, spooky Halloween, what a sight!
Knock on the door, trick or treat we say
We gather candies and off we sway
Witches, goblins and bats are here
Don't be scared, Halloween is here
Halloween, Halloween, it's so cool
Candy and costumes rule
So let's sing and hop under the moon
Halloween is here, it'll be bedtime soon
Halloween, Halloween, now it's time to dream
Of a world full of candy and a moonbeam
Halloween, Halloween, a magical night
We'll see you next year, oh what a delight
Oh what a delight
Halloween, Halloween, now it's time to dream
Of a world full of candy and a moonbeam
Halloween, Halloween, a magical night
We'll see you next year, oh what a delight
Halloween
