In the forest, in the middle of the bay, where space-time can be found in a little piece of juncture
There's a tear I can't force,'cause the feeling takes its toll
In the witch's house, deep in the middle of working the mall
On Halloween's eve when spirits weave
Through the air with a frightful heave
The witch casts a spell on the lanterns that swell
For the ghosts and the goblins that never compel
From the cauldrons brew
The mist so blue it spreads through the air
Like a shadowy hue
The black cat moans'neath the old grey stone
For the bruised rise a dance with skeletal bones
And she's a light that fuels the night
Candles burning are so bright
Stinky shadows keep their flight
In the house of fright on Halloween night
That's dead wing and the raven sing
A haunting tune and the bells will ring
The old clock strikes, it's the dark of life
Souls meet the earth and the silence spikes
Cobwebs glisten and the pumpkins listen to the whispers
And tales of the children christened, a knock at the door
Who could it be more than a trick or treat in the folklore core?
The broomsticks soar through the night they roar
As the witch dances never seen before
By the hearts warm glow, with the embers flow
With the eerie tale of the witchful grove
Rage is the laugh that fills the night
Candles burning us so bright
Spooky shadows give their fright
In the house of fright on Halloween night
Though the cauldrons brew on the old stone wall
And the leaves rustle up as they tickle and frill
Eyes in the dark where the ghostly spark
Watch over you as you leave your maw
So heed this word, let it not go unheard
On this festive night where the lines are blurred
Walked up the path light with a guard so tight
In the witch's house of Halloween fright
In a chisel act, it feels so night
Candles burning, oh so bright
Skulky shadows take their flight
In the House of Fright on Halloween night
As the dawn breaks through with the mist that's adieu
Look the witch's tail skates to the next moon's view
But remember if you dare, tread lightly there
Where the witch spends her magic in the shadows' lair
