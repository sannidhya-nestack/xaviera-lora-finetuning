In the heart of October, under the moonlight glow
There's a chill in the air and shadows begin to grow
Hear the rustle of leaves, the whispers of the spectral breeze
It's the time of the year when ghosts and goblins appear
Halloween, Halloween, night of fright
Journey through the evening under the pumpkin's light
Trick or treat, down the spooky streets
Only the bravest hearts dare to meet
Through the haunted mansion and the graveyard's gate
Unseen spirits whisper, "Join us, don't be late"
Crazy costumes, laughter and scream
Halloween, Halloween in mask and moon gleam
No telling what's behind you
Who will hear you scream?
Candy corn, apples dipped in dreams
Living the magic of Halloween
So here's to the enchantment
Here's to the fun
For on Halloween night
We all become one
With ghosts, with goblins, with witches unseen
Embrace the magic, ignite the dream
Happy Halloween
