Through curtains of the night, a symphony begins
Echoing through haunted halls where shadows sin
In the spectral gloaming where ghosts despair
Black roses bloom under the moon's cold glare
Playing the serenade, whispering a ghostly tale
In the silent theater where shadows prevail
Welcome to the night where darkness unveils
Songs of the otten on the phantom gears
With every strum, a shiver down the spine
The melodies dance, the harmony intertwine
In the candlelit ballroom where spectres twine
Gothic archers witness the melancholic sign
In the heart of midnight, the eerie dirt resound
Beneath the starless sky, where silence is found
Lingering in the air where fears surround
The haunting echoes of the night's profound
So vanish into the void let the dark blanket drain
In this hollow madness there is no escape
Welcome to the night where darkness unveils
Songs of the otten on the phantom girls
With every strum, a shiver down the spine
The melodies dance, the harmony intertwine
In the candlelit ballroom where spectres twine
Gothic archers witness the melancholy
