Ooh, it's Halloween night
Spooky ghosts giving us a fright
We put on our costumes, feeling so great
Trick or treat is the date, we just can't wait
Halloween, Halloween, so much fun
Fill our bags until the night is done
Candy bars and lollipops
We won't stop until we drop
Knock on the door, who could it be?
A witch, a vampire or a bumblebee?
We say trick or treat with a glowing smile
Running from house to house, mile by mile
Halloween, Halloween full of cheer
Scary and sweet this time of year
In the moonlight we laugh and play
Oh how we love Halloween day
So here comes the end, we've had our fun
Halloween, Halloween now we're done it
Tomorrow we'll count our treats with delight
Goodbye Halloween night, and to all a good night
Halloween, Halloween
So much fun
Fill our bags until the lot
Candy bars until we drop a drop
Macarena Halloween
So much to heap a drop
Knock on the door who knocks top
Halloween, Halloween
So much fun to cheer
A witch, a vampire or a bumblebee
We say trick or treat with glowing smile
Running from house to house mile by mile
Halloween, a ball of cheer, scary and sweet
This time of year
In the moonlight we laugh and play
On how we love Halloween day
So here comes the end, we've had our fun
Halloween, Halloween, now we're done
Tomorrow we'll count our treats with delight
Goodbye Halloween night
And to all a good night
