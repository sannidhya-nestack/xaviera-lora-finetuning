Halloween, Halloween
Fun and scary scene
Honking faces in the night
Glowing so bright
Trick or treat, trick or treat
Give us something sweet to eat
Ghosts and goblins walk tonight
Giving fucks a little fright
See the witches fly on grooves
Underneath the glowing moon
Skeletons dance, black cats prance
Halloween is our chance
Trick or treat, trick or treat
Walking down the spooky streets
Laughing, playing in the night
Halloween is pure delight
Halloween, Halloween
Once a year we make a scene
Wait until next Halloween
To do it all again so keen
