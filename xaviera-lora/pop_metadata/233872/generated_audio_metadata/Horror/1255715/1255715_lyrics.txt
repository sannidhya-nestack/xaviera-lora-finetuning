Halloween, Halloween, it's so neat
Dress up nice for the sweets
Knock on doors, say the words
Trick or treat, haven't you heard?
Halloween, Halloween, spooky fun
With pumpkins blowing in the night's fun
Round and round we gladly spun
Until the setting of the sun
Witches, ghosts and black cats, oh my
Beneath the twinkling starry sky
Halloween night, let out a sigh
It's magic, you can't deny
Halloween, Halloween, time for cheers
It's the best night of all the years
No worries and no fears
Halloween is finally here
So let's call it a night
Say goodnight
With memories of a joyful fright
See you next year
In spooky light
Happy Halloween sleep tight
Witches, ghosts, and black cats, oh my
Beneath the twinkling starry sky
Halloween night, let out a sigh
It's magic, you can't deny
Halloween, Halloween, time for cheers
It's the best night of all the years
No worries and no fears
Halloween is finally here
So let's call it a night
Say goodnight
With memories of a joyful fright
See you next year
In spooky light
Happy Halloween sleep tight
