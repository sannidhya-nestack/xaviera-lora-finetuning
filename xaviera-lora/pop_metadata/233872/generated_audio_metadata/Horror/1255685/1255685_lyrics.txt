It's time for Halloween, hip hip hooray! Let's dress up in costumes and play!
We might be ghosts, cool for a fairy queen On this night of fun called Halloween!
Knock knock, trick or treat Candies and chocolates, oh so sweet!
Up and down on every street Halloween is such a feat!
Jack-O-Lantern shining the night
Giving us a slacky light
Bats and witches take their flight
Halloween is such a delight
Yacht, don't stop with your feet
Move to the Halloween beat
With a boo, a laugh and a tweet
Halloween is really neat
Goodbye Halloween, time to go
We had fun in the ghostly glow
We'll miss you, this if so
Until next year with more booze to throw
Knock knock, trick or treat
Candies and chocolates, oh so sweet
Up and down on every street
Halloween is such a feat
Jack-o-lanterns shine in the night
Giving us a sparky light
That's the richest sparky light
That's Halloween, it's such a feat
Jack-o'-lanterns shining the night
Giving us a spocky light
Bats and witches take their flight
Halloween is such a delight
Shot, stomp, stomp with your feet
Move to the Halloween beat
With a boo, a laugh and a tweet
Halloween is really neat
Goodbye Halloween, time to go
We had fun in the ghostly glow
We'll miss you, this is so
Until next year with more boos to throw
Goodbye Halloween, time to go
We had fun in the ghostly glow
We'll miss you, this is so
Until next year with more booze to throw
