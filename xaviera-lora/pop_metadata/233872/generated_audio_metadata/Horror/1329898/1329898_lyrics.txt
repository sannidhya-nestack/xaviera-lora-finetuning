Echoes crawl down empty halls
Footsteps pounding shadows tall
Cold breath whispers close the door
Chills creep deeper can't ignore
Run with the shadows they're chasing you
Darkness falls
What will you do?
Run with the shadows
No time to wait
Step too slow
It seals your fate
Moonlight fades
The path turns black
The woods align
No turning back
Branches grab the night
Won't end the shadows here
Your only friend
Run with the shadows
They're chasing you
Darkness falls
What will you do?
Run with the shadows
No time to wait
Step too slow
It seals your fate
Faint cowbells ring a haunting tone
808's rumble, you're not alone
Choirs scream, the air is tight
Shadows dance, lost in the night
Run with the shadows, they're chasing you
Darkness falls
What will you do?
Run with the shadows
No time to wait
Step too slow
It seals your fate
