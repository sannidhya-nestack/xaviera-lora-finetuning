In a forest arm where the shadows play
There stood a house of azoso sway
With each whisper of the autumn breeze
A tale of dread, of ghosts it frees
On Halloween Eve
A night so warm when the veil twigs world
Is nearly gone, come gather close
Let me regale a simple, catchy haunting tale
Witch's house on the crooked lane
Where moonlight falls like haunted rain
Candles flicker in when window panes
Echoes of otten names
In the spooky, spooky night
Where the witches take their flight
Through the dark and eerie light
Skies are filled with pure fright
Jack-o'-lanterns with hollow eyes
Watch everyone who passes by
Ghoulish faces, sinister grins
Hide the secrets deep within
In the spooky spooky
