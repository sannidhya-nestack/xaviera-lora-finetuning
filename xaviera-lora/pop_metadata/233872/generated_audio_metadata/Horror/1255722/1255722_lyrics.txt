Halloween is here today
We dress up and then we play
We knock on doors and say trick or treat
Hoping for something sweet to eat
Halloween, Halloween, fun and scary
With pumpkins glowing, it's real merry
Ghosts and witches fly in the night
But don't worry, it's just a sight
We see spiders, bats and cats
And witches in pointy hats
Candy corn and apples too
Halloween is fun for me and you
Halloween, Halloween, full of fun
Under the shining moon or the sun
With a laugh and a scream and a song to sing
Oh what joy does Halloween bring?
So say it loud, say it clear
Halloween is finally here
A day of joy, a day of delight
Happy Halloween, let's enjoy the night
We see spiders, bats and cats
And witches in pointy hats
Candy corn and apples too
Halloween is fun for me and you
Halloween, Halloween full of fun
Under the shining moon or the sun
With a laugh and a scream and a song to sing
Oh what joy does Halloween bring?
So say it loud, say it clear, Halloween is finally here
A day of joy, a day of delight
Happy Halloween, let's enjoy the night
