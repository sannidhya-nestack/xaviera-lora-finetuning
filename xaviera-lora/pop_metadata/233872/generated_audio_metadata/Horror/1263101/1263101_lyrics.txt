There's a shade where the moonlight fears to tread
And there's a melody that's moving from the dread
A soft whisper through the night
As the lights grow dim
The story of the phantoms about to begin
The symphony starts with an eye shut tight
In the theatre of the shadows, where stars lose their light
A spectral warmth plays on as chilling as the frost
In the gallery of the otten, where no soul is lost
Through unlit chambers and haunted halls
An unseen chorus of apparitions calls
Their harsh lament fills the air, sung by no man or beast
In the grand ballroom of spectres where even angels ceased
Their mortal tune resounds, no likeness does it bear
To the world of the living none could compare
Only the hollow wind as the quiet audience
In the eerie silence filled with piercing resonance
Their symphony starts with an eye shut tight
In the theatre of the shadows where stars lose their light
A statue of space on its chilling as the frost
In the gallery of the otten where no soul is lost
Through unlit chambers and haunted halls
An unseen chorus of apparitions calls
Their harsh lament fills the air, sung by no man or beast
In the grand ballroom of spectres where even angels ceased
Their mortal tune resounds, no likeness does it bear
To the world of the living
