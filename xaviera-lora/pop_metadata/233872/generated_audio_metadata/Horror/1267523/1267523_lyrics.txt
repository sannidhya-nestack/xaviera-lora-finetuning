Upon the hill where shadows creep
There stands a house where witches weep
A place where ghouls and goblins play
On every eerie Hallows' Eve day
When the moon is full and glowing bright
The witch's cackle pierces the night
Through the mist her spell weaves tight
In spooky shrouds of eerie light
Surround the cauldron fire
Sing the chants of phantom choir
Raise your spirits, lift them higher
This is the witching hour's empire
Black cats prowl and ravens crow
Spirits whisper secrets low
Jack-o-lanterns lose their glow
As fear and fright begin to grow
Through cobweb halls and haunted eaves
Echoes of ancient spellbound leaves
Ghostly winds weave through the trees
On this night of Hallows Eve
Surround the cauldron fire
Sing the chants of phantom choir
Raise your spirits, lift them higher
This is the witching hour's empire
So gather round, young and old
Hear the haunted stories told
In the witch's house so cold
Where Halloween night unfolds
When dawn breaks, the spirits sleep
In shadows dark, their secrets keep
Until next year when night shall reap
The spooky tales of Hallows Deep
Dance around the cauldron fire
Sing the chants of phantom choir
Raise your spirits, lift them higher
This is the witching hour's empire
