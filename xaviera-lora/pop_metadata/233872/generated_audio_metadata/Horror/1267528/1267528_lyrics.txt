Midnight, when shadows grow
The wind does howl, the bellows blow
In an ancient wood where whispers tread
Lies a witch's house, the story said
Oh, the witch's house on Halloween Eve
Where spirits dance and shadows weep
Cackling fires and a ghostly tune
Beneath the gaze of a haunting moon
Walls and creaking doors
Black cat's eyes and spectral roars
Cold trends bubble, potions brew
Mystic spells in the midnight dew
Oh, the witch's house on Halloween Eve
Where spirits dance and shadows weave
Cackling fires and a ghostly tune
Beneath the gaze of a haunting moon
Pumpkins grin with sinister light
Ghouls and goblins take to flight
Bats flutter by in the sable night
Beware the witch's eerie might
As children gather wide-eyed with fright
Around the witch's house this fateful night
Stories whispered in the breathless air
Of hexes cast with the witch's glare
Oh, the witch's house on Halloween Eve
Where spirits dance and shadows weave
Cackling fires and a ghost tune
Beneath the gaze of a haunting moon
So heed this tale and tread with care
When Halloween's eve is in the air
For in the shadows you may find
The witch's house and the spell it binds
