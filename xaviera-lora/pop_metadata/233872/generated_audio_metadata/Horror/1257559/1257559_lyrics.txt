In the darkness, Halloween night
Under the full moon, soft light
Ghosts and ghouls starting to appear
Feel the chill, feel the fright
Halloween, Halloween time of thrill
Filled with suspense that gives a chill
Trick or treat from hill to hill
In costumes designed for the kill
Haunted houses track, the lanterns glow
Black cats cross the path below
Witches' laughter echoing slow
Halloween's magic truly on show
Halloween, Halloween, night of fear
Smiles and screams we all hear
Candy and laughter are so dear
Every heart beating like a drum in the ear
As midnight comes, it's the witching hour
Cherishing the night's bewitching power
Halloween's charm will never sour
Haunting memories like an immortal flower
Halloween, Halloween, time of thrill
Filled with suspense that gives a chill
Trick or treat from hill to hill
In costumes designed for the kill
Halloween, Halloween, time of fear
Smiles and screams we all hear
Candy and laughter are so dear
Every heart beating like a drum in the gear
