They looked even worse, here come the ghoulies
So you better run and hide, here come the ghoulies
And they're after you too, now here come the ghoulies
It's your nightmare come true, here come the ghoulies
They're moving in on you
They looked like the ghouls I'd seen on TV
I was too scared to move when one spoke to me
He said you're in for a big surprise
Tonight the dead will come back to life
He reached for me with the bony hands
And said you'll fit right into our plan
The look in his eyes gave me a clue
They'll be coming back
That's me and you, here come the ghoulies
So you better run and hide, here come the ghoulies
And they're after you tonight, here come the ghoulies
It's your nightmare come true, here come the ghoulies
They're moving in on you
They're coming through the window, banging at the door
Creeping across the rooftop, climbing through the floor
Don't know how they got here, it's a mystery
Better not get caught here, you'll be a three
I was freaking out when he came in close
Then he turned into a see-through ghost
I knew I had to make my getaway
Or I'd be taken over by a ghoul from the grave
I ran to the cellar and out the back way
Then came face to face with four of the same
One tried to grab me but I was too fast
And I kept on running and I never looked back
Here come the ghoulies
So you better run and hide
Here come the ghoulies
And they're after you tonight
Here come the ghoulies
It's your nightmare come true
Here come the ghoulies
They're moving in on you
Here come the ghoulies
So you better run and hide
Here come the ghoulies
And they're after you tonight
Here come the ghoulies
It's your nightmare come true
Here come the ghoulies
They're moving in on you
Here come the ghoulies
Here come the ghoulies
Here come the ghoulies
Here come the ghoulies
Here come the ghoulies
Here come the ghoulies
Here come the ghoulies
Here come the ghoulies
Here come the ghoulies
Here come the ghoulies
Here come the ghoulies
Here come the ghoulies
Here come the ghoulies
Here come the ghoulies
Here come the ghoulies
