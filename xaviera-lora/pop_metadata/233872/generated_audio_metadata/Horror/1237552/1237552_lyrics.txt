In the city's empty streets, a silly fright
No more shuffling in, just shadows in the night
The moon's on vacay, behind a cloak of dread
Creepers strolling, craving some brain bread
Once we boogie to jazz in the candlelight
Now dodging creepers, quite the silly sight
Our world's gone bananas on the edge we teeter
Try not to be on death's main course eater
It's the end of the world, can't you dig?
Undead madness ain't no place to wait
We're fighting for our lives against the grind
In this topsy-turvy world we'll surely find
Mostly streets were alive with flappers and jive
Now it's fear and moans, can we high five?
We grip hold tight in our strides, no why
But the creeper's hunger ain't nothing to hide
We used to crack up with laughter and fun
Now ducking, weaving on the run
Our hearts beat silly with fear and dread
In this new world, we're better off undead
the end of the world will catch a day
Undead madness ain't no place to wait
We're fighting for our lives against the grind
In this topsy-turvy world, we'll surely fight
But even in the goofiest dive
There's a glimmer of hope to revive
We'll rise up like a kazoo band's call
Together we stand
We'll give it our all
It's the end of the world, give it our all
It's the end of the world, can't you dig?
Undead madness ain't no place to wig
We're playing for our lives against the grind
In this topsy-turvy world we'll surely find
So let's keep the beat and the rhythm alive
In this unmet world we'll surely thrive
For even in the end, we'll make a stand
