On Halloween evening, the house was sparkling gold
Left a witch with secrets and stories to be told
A coffin wobbling leaves, lost cast through the night
With pumpkins in the garden glowing eerily bright
Oh, in the witch's house, fairy shadows play
Ghosts and ghouls come out to stay
Underneath the crest, flown silver gleam
Lost in a spooky haunted dream
Black cats on the prow, with eyes that glow gold
Bats fly through the air, mysterious and bold
Candles flicker, the air is thick with fright
Whispers in the corners as the clock strikes midnight
Oh, in the witch's house her shadows play
Ghosts and ghouls come out to stay
Underneath the cast-stone silver gleam
Lost in a spooky haunted dream
The children knock with a trick or treat
Echoes of laughter that sound so sweet
But beware the witch inside with a cackle and a grin
For Halloween's the time her magic will begin
Skulls on mantle, cobwebs all around
Every footstep in the night, a spine-chilling sound
The witch is through, witch is through
Flying through the air
Into the Halloween night with a spooky sort of flare
Oh in the witch's house where shadows play (shadows play)
Ghosts and ghosts learn not to stay
Underneath the crystal and silver gleam
Lost in a spooky haunted dream
Of children knocking with a trick or treat
Echoes of laughter that sound so sweet
But beware the witch inside with a cackle and a grin
Wolves burst through the corners as the clock strikes midnight
Midnight
So if you wander near on this frightful night
Be ready for a scare and hold your lantern tight
For in the witch's house, Halloween's delight
Echoes of the past are brought to eerie light
