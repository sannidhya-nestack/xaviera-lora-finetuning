Sink lights dance in the moon's pale light
Through the cobweb shrouds of the snake and night
Through haunted windows, gleams of fright
Detwined with the echoes of the spectral flight
The halls of the night, Christmas night
Underneath the veil between shadows and moonlight
Voiceless from the grave, a chilling delight
The echoed haunting lullaby till dawn's first light
If the slow wind comes, we fingers row
Traveling by shadows in the gulf, it don't
Candles flicker as Julie wins mo
A haunted symphony in cold stone
Mysterious portraits with eyes that follow
Tales of sorrow in the hall so hollow
In the silence something ancient they swallow
Awaiting the dawn in the morrow
We are sold as spectre's feast
And just a note holds consuming the night
We hope their gothic melodies succumbing to their might
Lost in the symphony of formidableness
