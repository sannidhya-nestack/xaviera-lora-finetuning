I'll tie the full little silver hue
It's Howie night and we're waiting for you
Ghouls and witches take the stage
In this spooky tale let your fears engage
Halloween, Halloween, echoes in the night
Casting shadows in the pale moonlight
It's a celebration, fetus delight
Step into the eerie, leave behind the bright
Trick or treat, don't miss a beat
Creeping along, hugging ghostly feet
From door to door, collecting sweets
In the chilling air, we're supernatural meats
Halloween, a mystical scene
In the cobweb corners where the spiders preen
It's time to laugh, it's time to scream
Ask in the magic of the Halloween dream
As the clock strikes twelve, bidding this night goodbye
Underneath the starry sky
Hallow's Eve'til the next we convene
