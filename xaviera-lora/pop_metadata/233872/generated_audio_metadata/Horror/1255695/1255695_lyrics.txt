Okay, it's Halloween, it's Halloween
The funniest ghost you've ever seen
We wear costumes oh so neat
Knocking on doors saying trick or treat
Halloween, Halloween's so much fun
Out in the night under the moon we run
Jack-o'-lanterns hiding candy so sweet
Halloween, Halloween isn't it neat?
Spooky stories, fun, and games
Halloween, oh how we love the name
Witches and monsters out to play
We love celebrating Halloween day
Halloween, Halloween, full of delight
Spooky and fun in the moonlight
Laugh and cheer, it's that time of the year
Halloween, Halloween is here
Halloween, Halloween, now we say goodbye
With a bag full of candy and a sorry sky
next year when we meet again
Happy Halloween, my friend
Spooky stories, fun and games
Halloween, oh how we love the name
Witches and monsters out to play
We love celebrating Halloween day
Halloween, Halloween, full of delight
Spooky and fun in the moonlight
Laugh and cheer, it's that time of the year
Halloween, Halloween is here
Halloween, Halloween, now we say goodbye
With a bag full of candy and a starry sky
Till next year when we meet again
Happy Halloween, my friend
