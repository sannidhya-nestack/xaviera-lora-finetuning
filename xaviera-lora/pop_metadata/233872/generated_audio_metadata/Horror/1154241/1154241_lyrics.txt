I'm coming for you in your dreams
I'll be there collecting screams
You should be afraid to sleep
I'm coming for you in your dreams
There is no place that you can hide
You'll wanna cover up your eyes
I'll be the tremble that you feel inside
There is no place that you can hide
I, I'm coming for you
Yeah, I, I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)
I am the nightmare that lives on
I'll haunt you'til your faith is gone
Death will become my victory song
I am the nightmare that lives on
I, I'm coming for you
Don't you know that I, I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you in your dreams
I'll be there collecting screams
