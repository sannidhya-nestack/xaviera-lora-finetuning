In the depths of the haunted night
Where ravens take their summer flight
Underneath the waning ghostly moon
A mournful timeless hour of June
In the realms of the shadows game
Where all things are never the same
In the midst of the chilling cold
Lie tales of the frightful and bold
Castle silhouettes stands tall, grimly grinning creature
Our souls caught in the endless snare
We tread lightly on these spectral floors
Through the creaking haunting doors
Erena's clinging like a shroud
In the silence screaming loud
In the orchestra of the frightful night
Fear and terror take their flight
Through the air the melody weaves
A lullaby for all Hallows' Eve
When the first light of dawn appears
The eerie music disappears
But in our hearts the memory stays
Of the dark orchestra that ever plays
Geck, take for the fuck on that, on your mod, take that
