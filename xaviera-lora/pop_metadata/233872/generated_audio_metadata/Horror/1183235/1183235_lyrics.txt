I walk in the crowd
I want to find someone alive
So many dumb guys
So funny, so nice
Like ice
I know who I'm on
And this is your hour
Yes, the hour
What do you hear?
The dead
Of those who are near
Who are still alive
Who strive long to fight
And they cry hope in the night
Hope is always right
He knows who's behind
It's the heart of this song
I know who I'm on
In this city of hell
Yes, this
