Halloween, oh what fun
Under the bright shining moon not the sun
See the pumpkins grin everyone
Tonight is for treats and fun
Trick or treat we say with a smile
In our costumes walking a mile
Candies and laughs all worthwhile
On this spooky Halloween aisle
Hear the bats fly in the night
Ghosts and goblins causing a fright
But with our lanterns shining bright
We're ready for the Halloween night
Trick or treat here we go
Through the eerie night's glow
With our spirits high not low
Halloween we love you so
Halloween, oh what a joy
For every little girl and boy
With their costumes and their toy
Goodnight Halloween, oh boy
Trick or treat we say with a smile
In our costumes walking a mile
Candies and laughs all worthwhile
On the spooky Halloween aisle
See the bats fly in the night
Ghosts and goblins causing a fright
But with our lanterns shining bright
We're ready for the Halloween night
Trick or treat here we go
Through the eerie night's glow
With our spirits high not low
Halloween we love you so
Halloween oh what a joy
For every little ghost
