Yeah, Michael M, R-Raid, OGR, Sintilla, haha, let's go
Vicious thoughts in my mind got me lost for a time
I can't find the rewind like a blind cause these eyes won't work
Tossing and turning in the dark pillow talking to myself
So I take it to the heart this is art this is hard
There's a car no garage tryna park but the engine won't stop
No surprise but I know this ain't all that it seems
A mirage a collage a barrage a montage on the rise
I should've saved the receipt, I don't want it (I don't want it)
I cannot go to sleep being haunted (being haunted)
I'm falling into a depression, watch me plummet
Can't keep running, something coming with no sign of warning (that I'm wanted)
Wish I could control every idea (idea)
And every emotion coming out that I feel (I feel)
But this is not the place for me to chase all the hate
While I'm tossing and turning, I'm trying to lie still
I feel the full moon rising
And the wind blows cold
All alone in the dark
Under hood there's a thought
Like a ghost hiding me
In the night of Halloween
I cannot live with this, I'm insidious
How to end the abyss of my brain
The terrain is a flame in the mist
Make my thoughts hideous, never stop
Just persist and consist with my fists
Why do I have to suffer
I've had enough of fear of myself, yeah
I need above, but try and I try to deny all the lies
Then I realize that the voices are mine and the screams on my side
So there's nowhere to hide, just me and my pride waiting'til we collide
Under the hood like the engine just died
Like the batteries fried, like the oil's not applied
I know I can resist eventually
I'd be admitted to a mental institution or a penitentiary
Scratching on the paddock walls with some that they mention me
Something that you get to see only on Halloween
I see the full moon rising
And the air turns cold
All alone
In the dark
Under her
There's a thought
Like a ghost
Vibing me
In the night of Halloween (Yo, yo, yo, yo, uh)
All alone (so why I'm always all alone)
In the dark (put the sheets over my head)
Underhood (hey, won't you open it up, man)
There's a thought (we goin' crazy, goin' crazy)
Like a ghost (like a ghoul, man)
Vibin' me (yo, I'm so mean now)
In the night of Halloween
Not another soul in sight
Can someone turn on the light
Maybe I should check it out
Then again I'm not so bright
It's the absence of life
Nothing nice nothing nice
Yeah in the night of
In the night of
Holloway
