Boo-boo, it's Halloween night
Ghosts and goblins causing fright
See the pumpkin shine so bright
Under the spooky lunar light
Trick or treat, smell my feet
Give me something good to eat
Halloween, Halloween, what a sight
Full of spooks and full of fright
Witches on the broom state flight
On this merry Halloween night
Candies here and treats so near
Oh Halloween is finally here
Halloween, Halloween, fun and fear
The most exciting night of the year
Giggles, laughs and lots of cheer
Halloween, oh dear, Halloween's here
Time to go, it's getting late
Halloween, you've been so great
We'll see you soon, wait for the date
Next year for more Halloween feints
Trick or treat on my feet
Give me something good to eat
Halloween, Halloween, what a sight
Full of spooks and full of fright
Witches on the brooms take flight
On this merry Halloween night
Candies here and treats so near
Oh Halloween is finally here
Halloween, Halloween, fun and fear
The most exciting nights of the year
Giggles, laughs, and lots of cheer
Halloween, oh dear, Halloween's here
Time to go, it's getting late
Halloween, you've been so great
We'll see you soon, wait for the date
Next year, four more Halloween fakes
