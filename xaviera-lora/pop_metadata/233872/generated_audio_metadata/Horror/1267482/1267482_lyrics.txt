All at night in the shadows so deep
Where the houses look low and the willows weep
In a crooked house on the edge of town
There's a witch so wicked with a haunting gown
And the witches have some Halloween Eve
Festive and spooky, it's hard to believe
Candles flicker and the windows freeze
Catchy chills that crawl and seize
Through the creaky door and the squeaky floor
The spiders, the webs as the ravens soar
Pumpkins lined up with a jagged grid
Lure you inside to the chaos within
Ooh, the witches have some Halloween Eve
Festive and spooky, it's hard to believe
Candles flicker and the windows breeze
Catchy chills that crawl and seize
Listen to the chanting, feel the eerie rhyme
Shadows dancing in the midnight time
Potions bubble in a cauldron black
Magic whispers calling you back
Ghosts and goblins they all come near
Drawn by the magic, drawn by the fear
But beware dear, child of the witch's spell
Once you're inside you'll never tell
Ooh, the witches' house on Halloween Eve
Festive and spooky, it's hard to believe
Candles flicker and the windows breeze
Catchy chills that crawl and seize
