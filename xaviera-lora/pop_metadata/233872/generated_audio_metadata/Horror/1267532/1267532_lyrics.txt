On a misty night where shadows creep
In a village old and dark
Stands a house where spirits weep
And the witches leave their mark
The moon is full, the air is cold
The trees do whisper tales untold
On Halloween Eve the legends grow
Of a house where terror flows
Oh in the witching hour hear the scary cries
Feel the magic linger under haunted skies
In the witch house standing at the forest's end
All the spooky spirits through the night will send
In the gardens twisted wild
Black cats prowling silent wait
Ghostly laughter from a child
Who met there her gloomy fate
Candles flicker in the gloom
Casting shadows fraught with doom
Figures dance in eldritch light
Embrace the terror of the night
Oh, in the witching hour hear the scary cries
Feel the magic linger under haunted skies
In the witch house standing at the forest's end
All the spooky spirits through the night will send
Through the window see the haze
