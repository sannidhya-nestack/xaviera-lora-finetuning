Underneath the moon so bright
Coolish fun begins this night
Jack-o'-lanterns glow with daylight
Oh, it's a Halloween night
Wolves are howling, witches cackling, monsters roaming, chains are clattering
Halloween, oh Halloween, in your shadows we're unseen
Ghosts and goblins, it's their scene, it's a wild and wicked Halloween
Through the haunted maze we tread
Where scarecrows guard the undead
Wisps of fog, a sense of dread
Chills and thrills ahead they spread
Bats are flying, owls are crying
In this night there's no denying
Halloween, oh Halloween
In your magic we're serene
Tricks and treats in between
It's a mischievous spirit Halloween
As the midnight hour leans
Cheers to a captivating Halloween
Through each frightful and fun scene
We embrace the mystery of Halloween
