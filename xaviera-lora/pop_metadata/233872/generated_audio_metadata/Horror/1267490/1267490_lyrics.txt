In the heart of the wood where the shadows dwell
There's a tale to tell of a Halloween spell
A witch's house on a moonlit night
Turning whispers to thrills and fright
Oh, come inside if you dare to see
A cauldron's brew and enchanted tea
Ghostly figures at the creak of the floor
Slippers hidden behind the door
In the witch's house on Halloween Eve
Stinky magic you won't believe
Candles flicker with eerie glee
A haunting place for a nightmare dream
Midnight strikes and the bats take flight
Javelin turns, casting eerie lights
Cobwebs drift on the old oak chair
A spectral presence everywhere
Black cats purring with eyes aglow
Wing howling through the trees below
Skeletons dancing on the cobweb smell
Ringing echoes of the ghostly bell
In the witch's house on Halloween eve
Spooky magic you won't believe
Candles flicker with eerie gleef
A haunting place from a nightmare dream
Witch's cackle fills the air as she stirs her potion with wicked flare
Grim shadows in the spectral walls, chilling whispers from otten vaults
Your slimes shocked with a thunderous boom, feel the presence in the chilling gloom
A night of fright as the spirits soar with tales to tell forevermore
In the witch's house on Halloween Eve, spooky magic you won't believe
Candles flicker with eerie gleek, a haunting place full of nightmare dreams
Echoing screams and haunted song
In the witch's house where you don't belong
A night of terrors, of tales and lore
Visit once and return no more
In the witch's house on Halloween Eve
With spooky magic you won't believe
Candles flicker with eerie gleef
A haunting place from a nightmare dream
In the witch's house on Halloween Eve
Spooky magic you won't believe
Candles flicker with eerie gleef
A haunting place from a nightmare dream
In the witch's house on Halloween Eve
Spooky magic you won't believe
Candles flicker with eerie gleam
A haunting place from a nightmare dream
