I was working in the lab late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise
And suddenly, to my surprise, he did the mash
He did the monster mash, the monster mash
It was a graveyard smash, he did the mash
It caught on in a flash, he did the mash
He did the monster mash
From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes (monster bash)
They did the monster bash (the monster bash)
It was a graveyard smash (monster bash)
It caught on in a flash (they did the bash)
They did the monster bash
The zombies were having fun
The party had just begun
The guests included Wolfman, Dracula and his son
The scene was walking over digging the sounds
Igor on chains backed by his hounds
The coffin bangers were about to arrive with their group
The Crip Kicker Five (they played the match)
They played the monster match (the monster match)
It was a graveyard smash (they played the match)
Oh, it caught on in a flash (they played the match)
They played the monster match
Monster Mash
Out from his coffin, Drax voiced in a ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said
Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist? (Monster Mash)
It's now the Monster Mash (Monster Mash)
And it's a graveyard smash (It's a graveyard smash)
Oh, it caught on in a flash (It's now a bash)
It's now the Monster Mash
Now everything's cool, Drac's part of the band
But Monster Mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living, this mash was meant to
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you
(Let me mash)
Then you can Monster Mash
(Let Master Mash)
And do my graveyard scratch
(Let me mash)
You'll catch on in a flash (monster bash)
Then you can monster bash (monster bash)
Monster bash (monster bash)
On the scrabble, scrabble, scrabble, scrabbble, scrabble, scrabble, scrabble, scrabble, scrabble
He did the bash
They did the monster bash
The monster bash
It was a graveyard smash
It was a smash
It caught on in a flash
He did the bash
They did the monster bash
They played the monster bash
The monster bash
It was a graveyard smash
It was a smash
It caught on in a flash
He did the bash
They played the monster bash
They did the monster bash (the monster bash)
It was a graveyard smash (it was a smash)
It caught on in a flash (we did the mash)
They did the monster bash
They played the monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
It caught on in a flash
They played the monster mash
They did the monster bash
It was a graveyard smash
It caught on in a flash
They did the monster mash
They played the monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
