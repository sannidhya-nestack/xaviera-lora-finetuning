The dusk night leaves the twisted trees
And weary children fades carry on the warm midnight breeze
And the high castle shadows over the ancient stones
Lousy eyes are watching from the darkness they call home
Through night they wander, figures of despair
Hark to melodies that go through the golden heart of nowhere
Hear the spectral garden from where the fallen leaves amass
The spirit of the
He is who stares from behind the looking glass
Girl, that dimension merged among the man
