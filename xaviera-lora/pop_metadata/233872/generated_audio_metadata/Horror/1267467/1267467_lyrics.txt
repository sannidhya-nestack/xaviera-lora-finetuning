On Halloween evening, the moon shines bright
In the shadow of the woods, such a haunting fright
There's times when it's a witch -<|7.88|>
With dread, with pumpkins abloat in the garden bed
The hitling moans and the bats do fly
A ghostly wail echoes through the sky
The witch stirs her cauldron deep in the woods
In the tale of old she's up to no good
In the witch's house on a hallowed seat
Where the spirits whisper and shadows weave
Candles flicker with a ghostly gleam
Casting spells in the night's dark scheme
Casting spells in the night's dark scheme
She brews a potion in her ancient pot
With bones and herbs and things long ot
Chanting spells in a voice so dire
Summoning spirits
It's from the witching fire
The black cat plows with an arching pack
Jack-o'-lanterns guard her on the winding track
The children wander drawn by the light
Into the clutches of the endless night
If you hear a cackle or glimpse a witch's hat
Be wary, be wary, oh heed to that
For the witch's household secrets sold
In the shadows of Halloween gold
In the witch's house on a hallowed sea
Where the spirits whisper and shadows weave
Candles flicker with a ghostly gleam
Casting spells in the night's dark scheme
So gather close on this haunted night
By the fires glow in the eerie light
Tell the tale of the witch's spell
Of the house where dark things dwell
In the witch's house on a Hallows Eve
Where the spirits whisper and shadows weave
Candles flicker with the ghostly gleam
Casting spells in the night's dark scheme
The witch's house, beware the fall
For all hollows, he brings fear to all
Hold tight your laughter, keep close and near
In the night of fright, keep away from here
