A bloody guillotine, a gift for Halloween
Dragon wings, ghoulish things remind me of you
A flying monkey ride, the nude pie that you fried
Rusty swings, ghoulish things remind me of you
We ate the monster hash at a wolfman's graveyard bash
A phantom sings ghoulish things that remind me of you
The crafty clever ghouls that stole them bones and jewels
A spooky blings ghoulish things that remind me of you
This fire of Frankenstein, we bathed in calamine
Haunted springs, ghoulish things remind me of you
The gargoyle in the room, my black dress and my broom
Ghostly flames, ghoulish things remind me of you
Dragon wings, frosty swings
Phantom sings, spooky blaze
Haunted springs, ghostly flings
Remind me of you
