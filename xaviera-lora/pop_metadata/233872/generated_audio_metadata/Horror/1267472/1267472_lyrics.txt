On a night cloaked in shadow and fog
Where the wolves and the ravens, they all prowl along
In the heart of the forest where the trees start to lean
Stands a house so, so wicked on Halloween
Hark! The creak of an old wooden door
the witch's lair, do you dare explore?
Her cackle, it pierces the velvety night
As the lanterns flicker in ominous light
Round up bubbling cauldrons so black and so deep
Where the shadows awaken from their eldritch sleep
An alchemist's recipe sealed with a curse
Awaits the brave souls to make matters worse
Children in costumes parade down the lane
Unaware of the witch and her spellbinding reign
Trick or treat echoes through valleys and streets
While the witch hums a dirge to nonsensical beats
Spiders and bats cast sinister charms
Jack-o'-lanterns, they grin with crooked arms
Ghosts whisper secrets in spectral delight
For they know this is more than just another night
In the garden, gnarled and tangled with brine
Lie the sacred stones aligned in a line
For a ritual old as the stars of yore
Will summon the spirits from realms no more
As the clock strikes a midnight haunts
The witch's laughter so cold it taunts
A storm brews with malevolently
Unleashing the banshees that none should see
When morning arrives with its pale golden rays
The witch and her house fade into the haze
Leaving whispers of fear and a story to tell
Of a Halloween night under a spell
