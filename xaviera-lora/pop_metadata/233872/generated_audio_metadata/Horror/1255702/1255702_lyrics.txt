Love it up, kids, Halloween night
Pumpkins are shining so bright
Put on your costume, hold on tight
It's time for a friendly fright
Halloween, Halloween, full of cheer
Trick or treating, far and near
Smiling faces, far and clear
It's the best time of the year
Knock knock, who could it be?
Candy for you and for me
From spooky witches, goblins free
Halloween's a fantasy
Halloween Jack-o'-lanterns glow
Scary stories whispered low
Running under the moon's bow
Oh how we love Halloween so
So sing this song with all your fun
When Halloween night has just begun
Say goodbye when the night is done
Oh Halloween we love your run
Dabs in the ass straight in griffle
Always straight today
Exit count 45 to ride your baby right
Fix the ox up with a pot down
Sis pump around to back clock
They're all friend you know some first crashing
This is a free but you briffle
Consider shmackin' griffle in the SSA gear
With arrows of will it's raining griffle
In all cases if you are with a feeling chin
To camp sweet and watch for rifles
Fill your days on straight today
And she the can sucks rock lips
Hold on child it's a KCR
No I could be a saw
Pullin' ease all
Say goodbye when the night is done
Swag race, all our cars will be out some free and go
Halloween night has just begun
Look look it's Halloween night
Pumpkins are shining so bright
Put on your costume, hold on tight
It's time for a friendly fright
Halloween, Halloween, jack-o'-lanterns glow
Scary stories whispered low, running under the moonlight
