Go to the Holy Land for a vacation
Feel the ancient history of the Jewish nation
When you least expect it might knock you off base
Won't recognize yourself your spirit's been replaced
Jerusalem Syndrome
Say shalom
Your brain is on a new program
Suddenly you think you're Abraham
Say shalom
It's a crazy thing that one can't explain
It starts to happen after you deplane
That guy eating falafel, I know who he is
Didn't he leave the Israelites, I think it's Moses
Jerusalem Syndrome, say Shalom
Your brain is on a new program
Suddenly you think you're Abraham
Say Shalom
If you wonder if such a place exists in America's land
Go to Hollywood Boulevard and meet Spider-Man
Jerusalem Syndrome
Say Shalom
Your brain is on a new program
Certainly you think you're Abraham
Say Shalom
Jerusalem Syndrome
Say Shalom
Your brain is on a new program
Suddenly you think you're Abraham
Say Shalom
