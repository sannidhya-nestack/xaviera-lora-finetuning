(Ahhh)
(Ahhh)
Floating in a sea of love
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
Oh, how lovely you are now
Only here
Only love
Float in the sea of grace
No form, no face, no time, no place
Only spirit
Holy Grace
Floating in a sea of bliss
Ah
Love that, love this, love analysis
Only deep
Only bliss
Ah
Floating in a sea of waves
Ah
No he, no she
No you, no me
I'll be with you all the time
I'm lost in this love
