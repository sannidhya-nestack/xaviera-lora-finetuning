When I first saw you walking by
You took my breath away
My heart skipped a beat
I knew then you were the one
When I first saw you walking
You took my breath away
Then my heart skipped a beat
I knew you could be the one
Tell me, tell me, tell me
What's on your mind
Tell me, tell me, tell me
What's on your mind
Are you playing
Are you teasing
Are you playing
Are you teasing
