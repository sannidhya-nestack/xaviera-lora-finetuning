Good, good, good, good, good, good, good
It got me thinking, now I know I know
As I roll back the tape, it explains a whole lot
Let me help you now, I got a whole lot you can't
Waiting in line, now you coming back
Coming back for more, are you just confused
I won't ive you, I don't hurt over you
Let me help you now, I got a whole lot you can't
Waiting in line

Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead
It got me thinking, now I know I know
As I roll back the tape, explains a whole lot
Let me help you now, I got a whole lot you can't
Wait in the line, now you coming back
Coming back for more, are you just confused
I won't ive you, I don't hurt over you
Let me help you now, I got a whole lot you can't
Wait in the line
