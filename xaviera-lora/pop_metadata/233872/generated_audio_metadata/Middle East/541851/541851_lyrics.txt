The light in the dark of this world, your truth is
Weep down and bathe in tears that aren't his
He is our protector, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God
Be gathering your justice and peace to your sons
Through sunshine, through clouds, on the sand of endless
All of your creation, heroes, our friend, deities
We ask for iveness
Please God bring your justice and peace to your sons and daughters
Of this world your truth is
We'll kneel down and bathe in tears that flood the ears
The ears are protected with the flesh of the King
Unified we pray and sing
