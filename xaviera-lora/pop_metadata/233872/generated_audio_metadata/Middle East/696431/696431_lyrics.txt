Now I have lost my mind
A wide river, a wide river
No matter what you see, you gotta keep on through
Tell me, do you think we'll ever see the light
The way this tunnel hugs us, tight love
Let us our heart era to squeeze by
Into the night summer breath
Many times I've thought of turning back around
But then you hear the hunters calling
That you're in their voice guide through you
Unlike the stars in the sky
Across the wide
Across the wide, wide, wide
Wide river
Across the wide
'Cross the wide, wide, wide, wide
Wide rivers cross
One by one we dared to glimpse up on our escape
The rain hasn't stopped falling for days
Bitter for the tracks and the mud that we left on the riverbed
Across the world
Across the world, world, world, world, world, world, world, world, world, world, world, world
Across the wide, wide, wide river
It's across
It's across
Across
It's enough, yeah
Tell me what's coming, it's what you read, what you saw, or not
And what you would say, is that we had to pay
Generations of frustrations, people heading in here
Soft stones on the way
Spooky torches above
With a fury for gods, but they're fumbling for love
Chasing down the mountains, the roads your thousands go
Across the wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide cross the wide way one line yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hustle on and on and on and on
Live again, live again, live again
