Eh-oh!
About hey!
Hup, two, three!
If you wanna be strong, gotta lift some weight (If you wanna be strong, gotta lift some weight)
Not just once, but every day (Not just once, but every day)
Everyone's heard across this land (Everyone's heard across this land)
Ahab is the strongest man (Ahab is the strongest man)
Well, you gotta be strong to stomp around the way I do
And you gotta have strength to have a name like Ahab
You can't sleep all day, you gotta lift those weights the way I do
Then you can be a star in a circus show like Ahab
If you're wondering how I do it
Well it's really something
I'll show you how to get through it
Here goes nothing
Grab that barbell
Hold on tight
Grunt and groan, lift it up, push it high with all of your might
Come on, grab that barbell, hold on tight
Grunt and groan, lift it up, push it high with all of your might
That's how we get the job done under the big top
Next time that fart rolls around each and every one of you give me a hand
I meet the kids in every place along the way
They all wanna be a strong man just like I have
If you wear your costume proud and lift your weights each day
Then you can have a circus show like strong man I have
If you wanna know how I do it
Well it's really something
I'll show you how to get through it
Here goes nothing
Grab that barbell
Hold on tight
Grunt and groan, lift it up, push it high with all of your might
Come on, grab that barbell
Hold on tight
Grunt and groan, lift it up, push it high with all of your might
I said strong man, a half built like a tree
Lift your weights, be the best that you can be
Bicep, tricep, quadricep, chest
Strong man, I insist to do your best
All the boys and girls all across this land
Listen to me cause I'm the strongest man
Early in the morning when the sun comes up
The tough get going when the going gets tough
Grab that barbell
Hold on tight
Brought and grown, lift it up
Push it high with all of your might
Come on
Grab that barbell
Hold on tight
Rot and groan, lift it up
Push it high with all of your might
