Beneath the crimson banners high
The drums of war begin to cry
A kingdom's fate on a blade so cold
A tale of glory yet untold
Raise the torch, let the shadows fall
Hear the trumpet's sanctioned call
Through the fire, through the rain
We write our names in the Hall of Kings again
The queen stands still with a tear of stone
The crown feels heavy, the throne alone
In halls of gold where whispers bloom
Lies weave a kingdom's doom
Swords like thunder, hearts aflame
Hold no lost, yet love remains
In every scar, a stalk reborn
In every loss, a crown is won
Raise the torch, let the shadows fall
Hear the trumpet's centered call
Through the fire, through the rain
We'll rally our names in the Hall of Kings again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Raise the torch
Let the shadows fall
Hear the trumpets and chants call
Through the fires, through the rain
We write our names in the Hall of Kings again
