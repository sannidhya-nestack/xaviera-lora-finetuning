Back in your arms
I stepped off the plane, boots worn and tired
A soldier home from battles where hearts can fight
The city's quiet streets call out my name
The jaw embrace that cools the flame
Back in Garaz, where I belong
Away from the wars and the soldiers saw
Lay down my arms, for your loving charms
I'm finally home safe in your arms
Through desert sands and rain soaked night
Your letters kept me through the lonely fights
Your words were whispers in a world so loud
Guiding me home when love's so loud
Ooh, I'll say, something won't see words tonight (I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't)
Race and infer our dreams
Let's paint our dreams on the evening sky
With our regrets lost to the lullaby
The soldier's heart is free at last
In your embrace the shadows pass
Back in your arms where I belong
Away from the wars that the soldiers fought
Lace down my arms with your loving charms
So
So, I need no love
Well, give me straight your love
Tell me who is right
With every hard seed I am yours
Back in your arms forevermore
