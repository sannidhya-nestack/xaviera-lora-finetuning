On the way to work one morning
At an outdoor cafe
Sitting down to drink my coffee
Something made me look away
When I turned my head I saw him
He was staggering around
Looking lost
Or maybe he was found
So I offered him some water and he quickly drank it down
He said he'd been in battle in that beautiful new town
And he showed me what he held on to, it was red, white and blue
And I knew he was fighting for me and you
His name was Freedom
In America, freedom
He was hurt, but he couldn't be broken
He will never give in, his name was freedom
In America, freedom
And he'll live on and on
I asked him, "You from around here?"
Said, "He lives in every land
From the heights of Colorado
To the depths of Florida sand"
And I thought he looked familiar
Like a long lost high school friend
And I knew
He'd be with us to defend
Then he told me of his story, couldn't believe what he had seen
From the best of human kindness to the worst of human beings
But he felt his life transforming right before his very eyes, seeing hope
Through the dust and darkened skies
His name was freedom
In America, freedom
He was hurt
But he couldn't be broken
He will never give in
His name was freedom
In America, freedom
And he'll live on and on
And I thought about this day
How the world would never be the same
Through my prayers I heard him say
We're so lucky to live in the USA
And I begged him not to leave us
He said he had to be moving on
There were lots of people needing
To feel the strength of his loving arms
So I thanked him for giving us courage
He said we'd had it deep inside
Through my tears
My heart was filled with endless pride
His name was freedom, in America freedom
And he'll live on and on
His name was freedom, in America freedom
We'll always sing this freedom
