Empty sockets stare at skies of grey
Where broken empires turn to clay
The dust of nations fills the dying air
A bitter silence, no one left to care
We built a pious high to claim a throne
Now only echoes reap what we have sown
The banner falls, its colors drained and torn
It waits for nothing in the age reborn
To sorrow
Hear the silence of a million souls
A hollow thunder where the hatred rolls
We traded reason for a sharpened blade
And watched the promise of the world decay
A costly prize for lies we bought and sold
The cycle of ash, the fields are dead
We kill the living for the ghosts ahead
Her veins are madness, we march and bleed
To plant cold idols of a vicious creed
Tell me the purpose, tell me the gain
When all that's left is crimson rain
A monument to fury, a tower of hate
The leader's voice, a serpent's hiss
Turns every truth to emptiness
For pride, for land, they chant and burn
But none return, none ever learn
The soldier's eyes, a hollow stare
They see their mirror in the enemy there
No glory here, no righteous fight
Just pawns erased by endless night
From this cold ground no seed will rise
We see the rod beneath the grand disguise
The only victor left upon this stage
The shadow of the reaper's rage
No flag can heal what war inherits
The cycle of ash, the fields are dead
We kill the living for the ghosts ahead
There's a witness, we march and bleed
To crown the void, the only creed
Tell me the purpose, tell me the gain
When all that remains is crimson rain
A monument to fury and all in vain
Ash, just ash
Ash, just ash
