A little brain damage
So very unkind
It's all it takes to keep me alive
Have you ever got to me?
A little trust in you
So very unkind
Meltdown everyday
Capri in fire
You bother me
You bother me
You get down in there
Step back from me
From me
Now you see
It's too late, it's too late
Two faced heroes sucking off pride
Are zeros like me entitled to a life?
Maybe they will kill you someday
I will never et what we learned here
I'll try, I'll try
I will never try, I will never try
You who bother me
You bother me
You get down and now step back
From me, from me
Now you see
It's too late, it's too late
Another friend unknown
I won't miss you
Another friend unknown
You will haunt me
Another friend unknown
