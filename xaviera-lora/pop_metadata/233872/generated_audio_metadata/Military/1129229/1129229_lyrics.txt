America, America, God shed His grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea
O beautiful for pilgrim feet
Whose stern impassioned strains
Of thoroughfare for freedmen
Across the wilderness
Amazing grace
America, America
God mend thy every flaw
Confirm thy soul in self-control
Thy liberty, yeah
O beautiful for heroes proved
In liberating strife
Who more than self their country loved
And mercy more than life
Who are made for love
America, America, may God thy glory find
all success be nobleness and every gain divine
O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam, undimmed by human tears
Amen
America, God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea
