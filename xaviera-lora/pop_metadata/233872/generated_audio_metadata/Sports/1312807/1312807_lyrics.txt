Saturday morning, 8am, riding my bike to the park
Batting gloves strapped to the basket spikes hanging from the handlebars
The last game of the year, winner take all
Eighteen warriors looking for a fight
Waiting for the young T .L. play ball
It was the big game, the two best teams
Our dream ticket to the hall of fame
Yeah the big game, I remember every minute
We all wanted to win, it was the big game
First three innings went by fast goose eggs on the board
Then a walk-a-hit, two on two out game on the line top of the fourth
Rocky hit a long fly ball to right
Fasted it went back to the wall
But it was going, going, gone
Clean out of sight it was the big game
The two best teams our dream ticket to the hall of fame
Yeah the big game I remember every minute
We all wanted to win it was the big game
Behind by three, bottom of the ninth, two out, Billy on first
Fats got hit on his backside, he laughed, said it didn't hurt
The stage was set when shorty took ball four
My friend Stretch was on the mound
But I was up and this is the war
I became an instant hero with one swing of the bat
My Grand Slam didn't make the news
But it doesn't change the fact
It was the big game, the two best teams
Our dream ticket to the hall of fame
Yeah, the big game, I remember every minute
We all wanted to win, it was the big game
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
