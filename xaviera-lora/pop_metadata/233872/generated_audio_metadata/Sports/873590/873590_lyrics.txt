Through the hole in the line with a twist
I ain't never felt alone like this
Hands up reaching to me
They want me down on my knees
Hail Mary here we go we go
Hail Mary here we go
Through the shotgun, I know
Hail Mary, here we go
A part of me, a part of you
Apart from this, ain't nothin' to lose
Feel like it's a live sound
And I'm gonna kick the hell right out of the sound
Hail Mary, here we go, we go
Hail Mary, here we go
Through the shotgun, I know
Hail Mary, here we go
Seconds left, moment of truth
Will I ever be alone with you
Hands up, reach in the air
Sometimes I just don't care
Hail Mary, here we go, here we go
Hail Mary, here we go
Through the shotgun I look
Hail Mary here we go
One, two, one, two, three, four
Hail Mary, here we go, we go
Hail Mary, here we go
Through the shotgun I low
Hail Mary, here we go
Hail Mary, here we go, we go
Hail Mary, here we go
Through the shotgun I load
Hail Mary here we go
Hail Mary here we go we go
Hail Mary here we go
Through the shotgun I load
Hail Mary here we go
Hail Mary here we go
Hail Mary here we go
Hail Mary here we go
Hail Mary here we go
