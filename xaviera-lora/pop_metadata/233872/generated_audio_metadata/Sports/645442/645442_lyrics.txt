All your life you've been running to get where you're going
Now at last you've found a friend who wants to run along
I think we're on our way
We're gonna make it to where we're going
I think we're on our way
To make dreams come true
I think we're on our way
We're gonna make it to where we're going
I think we're on our way
To make dreams come true
All your life you may struggle to get where you're going
You're gonna need a friend beside you when storms come rolling in
I think we're on our way
We're gonna make it to where we're going
I think we're on our way
To make dreams come true I think we're on our way
We're gonna make it to where we're going I think we're on our way
To make dreams come true I think we're on our
Way to make dreams come true
I think we're on our way
To make dreams come true
