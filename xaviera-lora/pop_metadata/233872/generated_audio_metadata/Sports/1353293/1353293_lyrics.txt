We back, we back, running it up
We back, we ready, we ready
Stadium shaking heavy
Hands up, the crowd moving steady
Turn it to eleven, yeah the vibe too deadly
Big noise, we storm like a freight train
Ego on the rise yeah we break chains
Hands full of dreams
Pockets full of change
Pulses in the air feel the bass rearrange
Mic lit spit fire in the cold rain
Legends in to make it
Inked in the souls vein
Grunge on my kicks
Dirt on my gold chain
Flipping these scripts
Chaos in my whole lane
We came to shake it break it quake it
This is our time, no way to fake it (fake it)
We back, we back, running it up
We back, we ready, we ready
Stadium shaking heavy
Hands up, the crowd moving steady
Turn it to eleven, yeah the vibe too deadly
Fast life, we rev like a car chase
Hot hats spin quick, drums leave a scar trace
Light up the block, the baseline, a dark face
Trap lace with venom, venom in the hearts race
Work, work, work, work, work, work, work
Fast life, we rev like a car chase
Hi-hat spin quick, drums leave a scar trace
Light up, block the baseline, a dark face
Trap lace, with venom, venom in the heart's race
We back, we back, running it up
We back, we ready, we ready
Stadium shaking heavy
Hands up, the crowd moving steady
Turn it to eleven, yeah the vibe too deadly
Fast life, we rev like a car chase
High hat, spin quick, drums leave a scar trace
Light up the block, the baseline, a dark face
Trap lace with venom, venom in the heart
Brace, brace, brace, brace, brace, brace, brace
