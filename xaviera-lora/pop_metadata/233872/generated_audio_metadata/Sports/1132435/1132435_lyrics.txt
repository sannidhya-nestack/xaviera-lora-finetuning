Aye, aye, aye, aye, I'm not gonna waste my time now
Aye, aye, aye, aye, I just wanna feel this right now
Baby are you with me? I'm not begging please but for sure you won't see it
Aye, aye, aye, aye, I'm the one who you need
This is who I am now, not afraid to say it loud
This world is in my hands
I can be your hero, I can make it clear now
Just listen to my plans
Day day day day day day day
Do you wanna be, wanna be, wanna be?
Day day day day day day day
Play with me, play with me, play with me, play with me
