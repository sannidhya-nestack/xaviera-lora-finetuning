When the morning light breaks through the sky
And feeling like you wanna fly
Just lace up your shoes, let's give it a try
We're gonna rock this workout, you and I
Feel the rhythm pumping through your veins
Every step you take, every move you make
Together we'll conquer any terrain
Nothing's gonna stop us, we'll break the chains
Hey, let's get moving, feel the beat
We're on fire, can't be beat
In this moment we're alive
With every step, we'll thrive
Hey, let's get moving
Feel the beat
We're on fire, can't be beat
In this moment we're alive
With every step we'll fly
Hey, let's get moving, feel the beat
We're on fire, can't be beat
In this moment, we're alive
With every step, we'll thrive
Pushing hard and reaching higher
With determination, we'll never tire
Feel the energy burning like fire
This workout's taking us even higher
Feel the rhythm pumping through your veins
Every step you take
Putting it together will conquer any terrain
Nothing's gonna stop us, we'll break chains
Hey, let's get rolling, feel the beat
We're on fire, can't be beat
In this moment we're alive
With every step, we'll thrive
