Ready, set, go!
One, two, three, four
I ain't got the power
What the hell's going on? (I feel the speed in my veins)
But I have to be fast, it's just too slow to move
There's energy on the streets
That every single car impedes the way to you
I ain't got the power
Rock the house, oh yeah, oh yeah
I got the power, I feel the speed in my veins
But I have to be fast, it's just too slow to move
There's energy on the scene
But every single car beats away to you
Ready, set, go
