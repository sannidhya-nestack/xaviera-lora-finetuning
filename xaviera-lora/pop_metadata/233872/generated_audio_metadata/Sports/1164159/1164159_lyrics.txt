Hit that, hit that, hit that, hit that, hit that
Hit that, hit that, touch the ground
Hit that, hit that, hit that, hit that, hit that
Touch the ground
I wanna win it all
I wanna hit the ball
I wanna hit it all the time, the time
I wanna win it big
Then take the stick
I wanna hit it all the time, the time
Hit that, hit that, hit that
Hit that, hit that, hit that, hit that
Touch the ground, heat that, heat that (smack that)
Heat that, heat that (heat that)
Heat that, heat that (woo)
Touch the ground, heat that, heat that
Heat that, heat that (smack that)
I wanna heat that (heat that, heat that)
Touch the ground, heat that, heat that (smack that)
Heat that, heat that
(Hit that, hit that, hit that, hit that, hit that)
