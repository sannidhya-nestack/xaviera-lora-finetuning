Saturday morning, 8am, riding my bike to the park
Batting gloves strapped to the basket, spikes hanging from the handlebars
The last game of the year, winner take all
Eighteen warriors looking for a fight
Waiting for the umpteenth clay ball
It was the big game
The two best teams
Every boys dream to be number one
Yeah the big game
I remember every minute
We all wanted to win
It was the big game
First three innings went by fast
Gooseangs on the board
Then walk ahead, two on, two out
Game on the line, top of the board
Rocket hit along, fly ball to right
And fast steady went back to the wall
But it was going gone clean out of sight
It was the big game
The two best teams
Every boys dreamed to be number one
Yeah the big game
I remember every minute
We all wanted to win
It was the big game
Behind by three, bottom of the ninth
Two out, Billy on first
Bats got hit on his backside
Laughs said it didn't hurt
The stage was set when shorty took ball four
My friend Stretch was on the mound
But I was up and this was war
I became an instant hero
With one swing of the bat
My Grand Slam didn't make the news, but it doesn't change the fact
It was the big game, the two best teams
Every boys dream to be number one
Yeah the big game, I remember every minute
We all wanted to win it was the big game
The two best teams, every boys dream to be number one
Yeah the big game, I remember every minute
We all wanted to win it was the big game
