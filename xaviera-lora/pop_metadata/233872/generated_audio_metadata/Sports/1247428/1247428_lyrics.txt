I'm in the middle of the road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm in the middle of the road, yeah
We can go to hell, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm in the middle of the road, yeah
We've got the greatest team I've ever seen
You know what I mean
It is surely time
All in their prime
Oh it would be divine
We've waited all so long to cheer
We always seem to get so near
So come on boys, what's the crack?
It's about time we're bringing it back
We're bringing it back
Behind the enemy lines, we will be just fine, Harry will give us a sign
The fans will be there too
Always behind you
They know just what to do
We've got the players with all the tricks
Let's make it just like'66
So come on boys, watch the crack
It's about time we're bringing it back
We're bringing it back
We're bringing it back
Come on boys it's that time make some noise
Come on boys it's that time make some noise
Come on boys it's that time make some noise
Come on boys it's that time make some noise
We've waited all so long to cheer
We always seem to get so near
Oh, can you believe it?
England have finally won a tournament
And in Germany, no less!
We're bringing it back
We're bringing it back
We're bringing it back
