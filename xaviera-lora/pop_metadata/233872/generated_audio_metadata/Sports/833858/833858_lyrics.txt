Get ready for Showtime, for Showtime (Y'all ready?)
I'm so glad that you don't care
We ready for show time, for show time, for show time
We ready for show time, for show time, for show time
We ready for show time, for show time, for show time
We ready for show time, for show time, for show time
I miss a motherfuckin' pair
I'm ready for shit town, for shit town, for shit town
I'm ready for shit town, for shit town
I'm ready for shit town, for shit town for shit town
I'm ready for shit town, for shit town
