There's Fritos on the table in a plastic football tray
It's the biggest sporting moment in the USA
So I call my buddy Andy and I make all the food
I greet him at the door and he yells, "Dude !"
Wearing a football helmet with beers on the top
So you can sip without your hands and don't have to stop
He puts a rack of Guinness in the cooler by me
I see his wife turn sideways and say to Marie
I'm not sure I like Super Bowl Andy
I'm not sure I like
The way he behaves
I'm not sure I like
Super Bowl Andy at all
We got blow up armchairs
Inscribed with Miller Lite
And cheese head hats we purchased from the Packers site
But we prefer Seattle
So we painted them blue
Green Bay's not our team but cheese heads rule
There's hot and hotter hot wings and dip to cool'em off
And then we like to drench'em in Tabasco sauce
The girls are talking softly when Andy hollers "Sweet !"
He needs a small reminder so his wife repeats
I'm not sure I like Super Bowl Andy
I'm not sure I like
The way he behaves
I'm not sure I like
Super Bowl Andy at all
We get so excited when our team begins to score
So I grab the football closest to the couch
I send Andy long but then he trips and starts to fall
I cringe in horror when he puts his helmet through the wall
I'm not sure I like Super Bowl Andy
I'm not sure I like the way he hands
I'm not sure I like Super Bowl Andy at all
We're not sure we like Super Bowl Andy
We're not sure we like the way he behaves
We're not sure we like Super Bowl Andy at all
Super Bowl Andy at all
Super Bowl Andy at all
