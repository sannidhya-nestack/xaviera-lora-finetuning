See you is coming, we're coming coming coming see you is coming
We're coming coming coming see you is coming, we're coming coming coming
Get out the way buffaloes I'll run you over
See you is coming, we're coming coming coming See you is coming, we're coming coming coming
See you is coming, we're coming coming coming
Don't turn the station cause we're coming prime time
Prime time, we're pulling out our shades
Prime time, been doing this for days
Prime time, I see we got you looking
Prime time, take a seat while we're cooking
Pick six, seven, three equal ten
Sixteen on the board for the win
98 to go and we're never giving up
All eyes on the hunt for the dub
See you is coming
We're coming coming coming see you is coming
We're coming coming coming see you is coming
We're coming coming coming
Get out the way buffaloes I'll run you over
See you is coming
We're coming coming coming see you is coming
We're coming coming coming see you is coming
We're coming coming coming
Don't turn the station cause we're coming prime time
Prime time, we're pulling out our shades
Prime time, been doing this for days
Prime time, I see we got you looking
Prime time, take a seat while we're cooking
Pick six, seven, three equal ten
Sixteen on the board for the win
Ninety-eight to go and we're never giving up
All eyes on the hunt for the dove, dove, dove, dove, dove
Prime time, we're pulling out our shades
Prime time, we're pulling out our shades
Prime time, we're pulling out our shades
Prime time, take a seat while we're cooking
You see, you see, you see, you
