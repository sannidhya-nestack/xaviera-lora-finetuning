Say it loud, wear it proud, colors on your sleeve
Run it down to the ground, do it for the team
Bring it in, take'em out for the victory
Feel the crowd getting loud, moving to the beat (moving to the beat, moving to the beat)
Give'em all you have and the walls will crash
It's not dangerous when you take a chance
Put your right foot down
For a down bring a war attack
When you cross the line there's no going back
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are you ready to win?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are you ready to win?
Champion on the run only play to win
Number one till we're done always closing in
Give'em all you have and the walls will crash
It's not dangerous when you take a chance
Put your right foot down bring the war attack
When you cross the line there's no going back
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are you ready to win?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are you ready to win?
Oh, you run, run and you run, you run, run and you run, you run, run and you run, you run, run and you run
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are you ready to win?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are you ready to win?
Can't be done, I'm a runner, I'm a pain
No more one, two, until I die, I'll always be the same
Are you ready to win?
Can't be done, I'm a runner, I'm a pain
No more one, two, until I die, I'll always be the same
Are you ready to win?
