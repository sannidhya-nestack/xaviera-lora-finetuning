(We just made that)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
It's been a long day and a long night
What's been even longer waiting at this light
What I didn't notice sitting next to me
Riding on this engine like it's ecstasy
Don't go revving at the red light red light
You gon' find yourself a street fight street fight
You might lose yourself a headlight tail light
Don't go revving at the
When green means gold
Green means go, green means go
Then yellow means slow it down, slow it down
Then yellow means slow it down, down, down, down, down
I was going so fast that I cannot lie
We were driving insane down I-95
And then I seen her behind me tryna stay alive
The way she's swerving around straight to a side
Don't go revving at the red light, red light
You gon' find yourself a street fight, street fight
You might lose yourself a head light, tail light
Don't go revving at the
When green means go
Green means go
Then yellow means slow it down, slow it down
Then yellow means slow it down, down, down, down, down
It's about 2am on a Friday night
It was her and her friends everything was fine
It's getting close to the end almost time to go
Get your kisses and hugs when the music slow
Now we all outside'bout to jump in the ride
And we feeling the vibes ain't no place to go
Go, go, ain't no one on the road, road, road, road, road
When green means go
Green means go
Then yellow means slow it down, slow it down
Then yellow means slow it down, down, down, down, down
Don't go revving at the red light, red light
You gon' find yourself a street fight, street fight
You might lose yourself a headlight, tail light
Don't go revving at the (hey)
Don't go revving at the red light, red light
You gon' find yourself a street fight, street fight
You might lose yourself a headlight, tail light
Don't go revving at the
Don't go running like a red light, red light
Don't go running like a red light, red light
If you slow yourself down, shoot right, shoot right
You might lose yourself ahead of time, ahead of time
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah
We just made that
You might lose yourself ahead of time
