I see you and I wanted to know
Where you've been
And how you've been doing
Sometimes I wanna pick up and call
Sometimes the feelings not there at all
But somehow you stick out from the rest
I think it's just a case of the ass
I see you and I wanted to know
Where you been
And how you been doing?
Sometimes I wanna pick up and call
Sometimes the feelings not there at all
But somehow you stick out from the rest
I think it's just the case of the ass
I seen you and I wanted to know
Where you been
And how you been doing
Sometimes I wanna pick up and call, sometimes the feelings not there at all
