In a world that's turning slow
Where the sea and breezes flow
Find a place where we can go
Let the worries fade away
Oh
Underneath the sky so white
In the stillness side by side
Feel the rhythm of the tide
In this moment we reside
Whispered secrets in the night
Stars above, our only light
Hold me close, it feels so right
In your arms, I'm taking flight
Let the days just drift along
Hear the winds they sing a song
In this world where we belong
Everything is calm and strong
Colours blend as night turns day
In your presence I will stay
We're the waves in endless play
In this dream that leads the way
So let time just gently bend
As we find the perfect blend
In each heartbeat my dear friend
In this journey there's no end
So let time just gently bend
As we find the perfect blend
In each heartbeat my dear friend
In this journey there's no
