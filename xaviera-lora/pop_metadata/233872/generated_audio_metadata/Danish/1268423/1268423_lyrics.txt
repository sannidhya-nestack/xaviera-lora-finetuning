In the quiet of the night where the stars align
Whispers on the wind, stories intertwined
By the shore, the waves, they dance in time
A melody of peace, so warm, so fine
Through the fields where the wild flowers grow
Breezes carry dreams only hearts can know
In the city glow under the pale moonlight
Footsteps echo softly through the tranquil night
Through the fields where the wild flowers grow
Breezes carry dreams only hearts can know
In the city glow under the pale moonlight
Footsteps echo softly through the tranquil night
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll find a place where the silence sings
Where every moment a new hope brings
Close your eyes let your worries fall
In this gentle embrace we found it all
Let's drift away on a tender breeze
Where the world feels light and moments freeze
In your arms where the heartbeats flow
We'll find a harmony only we'll ever know
Beneath the whispering trees with leaves so green
We'll dance through the twilight lost in a serene dream
With every sigh in the world we create
Together forever this marvelous fate
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Let the calm surround as we breathe in deep
In this place of dreams where love we keep
Hand in hand through the quiet of the dawn
Together in this peace all fears withdrawn
