ive the morning's tears, only if you choose
Turn your starry eyes on me, being an endless day anew
In the night so bright, come back and think
Every little whisper of sea
For him there's entry sick to till
I can't feel the moon
If only you'd see
Sing from my mouth
Starry eyes on me
No stern or fellow, no
Silly, I convince me
Dreaming of your gentle gaze
In its thought, but for steel
Hold my hand so tight
Underneath the skin
With your starry eyes
Begoing, it stands afar
I give you the moon
If only you'd see
It's safe for now
Starry eyes on me
Nå stjernar fjallon nu, ser jeg kun dit smil
Dreaming of your gentle gaze in the stop of all steel
Hold my hand so tight, underneath I'm scared
With your starry eyes, vi går ingen stanser far
I'd gift you the moon
If only you'd see
Safe for now
Starry eyes on me
I'd gift you the moon
It's all that you see
Save for my now, sorry eyes on me
