Waves of morning light, soft winds passing by
Dreaming as we fly under the open sky
Whispers in the breeze, moments like these
Time begins to freeze, life is just a tease
And drifting out to sea, endless melody
You and here with me, setting our minds free
And nature's gentle song, and keeps us holding on
As we float along, and where we both belong
Here there's no rush in the quiet hush
Love's a tender touch in the dawn soft blush
Lost within a sigh clouds are drifting high
Let the world pass by we're together you and I
Here there's no rush in the quiet hush
Love's a tender touch in the dawn's soft blush
Lost within a sigh clouds are drifting high
Let the world pass by we're together you and I
