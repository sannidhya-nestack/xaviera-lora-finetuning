In the cool of the night
Where the stars glow bright
We find our peace
Everything feels right
Through the whispers of the breeze our hearts find ease
Moments frozen in time just a gentle tease
Floating on these melodies in our dreaming days
Colours blend and fuse in this subtle haze
Echoes of laughter memories in the sand
Holding on to the moments that slip through our hands
Softly, softly, the world sways to sleep
In this tranquil embrace, our secrets we keep
Eyes closed, hearts open, we drift with the tide
In this quiet solace, with you by my side
Harmony and silence in perfect blend
With every beat our souls transcend
Lost in this rhythm where we both belong
In this gentle hush we feel so strong
So let's stay in this moment till the dawn breaks through
Lost in this serenity, just me and you
No more worries, just a soft moonlight
In this calming silence, everything's alright
