Life flash, we shine, glisten, glimpsed so fine
Dann erden langsam in Förder wie aus Warme
Catch a smile in lights, glimmer in our sights
Life's a optin' vibe, mens wie Tänzer hat's a day
Disco bang, make it swing, sweet night in the spring
Dance my mind to a yacht, dancing through the sky
Go everywhere we start, rhythm takes our sight
Put zero first on view, can't fool our view still
Shine bright, let it ignite, feeling this tonight
Scab in my admit, now I'm sober baby
Disco bang, make it swing, sweet night in the spring
There's my mind to a yacht dancing through the sky
Catch a smile in lights
Glimmer in our sights
Lives are optimized
Men's feet dance ahead today
This disco thing make it swing
Sweet night in this thing
It's been light through our night
Dancing through the sky
Go everywhere we start
Rhythm takes our sight
Put zero first and we'll
Convert our fears to shine bright
Let it ignite feeling this tonight
Skalp med mig et midden
Nær om sommerbidder
Tæsk og vind
Make it swing
Sweet night in the spring
Dans med mig du og jeg
Dancing through the sky
Dancing through the sky
Dancing through the sky
