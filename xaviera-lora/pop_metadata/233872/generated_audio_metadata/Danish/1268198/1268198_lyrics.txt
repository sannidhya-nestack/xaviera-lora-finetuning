In the morning light, soft and calm it feels so right
Whispers through the trees like a gentle breeze
Sea of endless blue, dreams are flowing, drifting through
Time just slips away, in this perfect day
Floating on a cloud
Peaceful moments not too loud
Waves that kiss the shore
We don't need much more
Sunset paints the sky
Colors blend as day says bye
Stars will soon appear
Night is drawing near
Close your eyes and feel
All the world is so surreal
Rest in silent sound
Love is all around
Floating on a cloud, peaceful moments not too loud
Waves that kiss the shore, we don't need much more
Sunset paints the sky
Colors blend as day says bye
Stars will soon appear
Night is drawing near
Close your eyes and feel
All the world is so surreal
Rest in silent sound
Love is all around
