Floating on a gentle breeze
Through the moments, through the years
Sunset paints the sky with hues
Find the calm, the world to lose
Quiet whispers of the night
Soft and cool, the moon's soft light
City lights in distant view
Peaceful lanes we're walking through
In the rhythm of the rain
Drops that play a soothing game
Underneath the starry sheen
Heartbeats in the quiet beam
Leaves that rustle in the park
Footsteps echo after dark
Silence in the spaces found
Harmony the sweetest sound
Find the simple, find the grace
In this soft and tender place
Close your eyes and let it go
Feel the peace begin to flow
In the rhythm of the rain
Drops that play a soothing game
Underneath the starry sheen
Heartbeats in the quiet
