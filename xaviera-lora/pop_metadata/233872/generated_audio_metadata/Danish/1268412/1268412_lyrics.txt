Under the stars so clear and bright
Whispers of the wind tell tales tonight
In the stillness of the evening's glow
Dreams are drifting soft and slow
The ocean's waves they dance and play
Singing softly, come what may
Night unfolds its silent grace
In this quiet gentle place
Through the valleys low and high
Echoes of a lullaby
Moonlight casting shadows sweet
Guiding every tired heartbeat
In the meadows fresh and green
Where only peacefulness is seen
Nature's breath, a soothing tune
Cradles us beneath the moon
Breathe in deep, let worries go
Feel the calm within you grow
Hushed and quiet nights embrace
Find your peace in me
