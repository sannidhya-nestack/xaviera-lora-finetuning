Under the northern lights we float
In a place where quiet rivers go
Stars whisper secrets in the night
Guiding us in the soft moonlight
Feel the wind, it's gentle on the skin
Breathing deep, let the calm begin
Eyes closed, drifting with the tides
Where the heart in nature confides
Floating dreams in an open sea
Where the world just lets us be
Moments pass like a silent stream
Wrapped in love, it's a soothing dream
In this space, time stands still
