I let the himlen se jeg deg
Nå'n en danser, vi tog i leg
Et i lys, alt blir blød
Som døgn i søvn, vi flyter søvn
On the night sky, I see you
The moon dances just us two in your light
All turns soft like a dream and suddenly drift along
The boy I am that bitch girl
I'm on the skin, Cali hell now
Ain't no more, come get me
you're still gonna stay
On the night sky, I see you
The moon dances just us two in your light
All turns soft like a dream and slowly drift along
Do I hide the night it's scary?
Mourner skin, can you feel now?
In the war
Come get to sleep
The curse is down on the street
