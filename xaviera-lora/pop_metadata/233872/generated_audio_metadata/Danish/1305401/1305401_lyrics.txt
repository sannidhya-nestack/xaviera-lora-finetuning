Dem can can can can be and
Dem can can can so and I let's split split split
Dem can can can can see me hold the belly bag
Can't find a lot of things to own at the rack
My crack then a beetle
Relied to pay all the dinna for the
Oh
On for sensei so he send gold at silly fest greed
Let it call the door
Born hardcore
You know but hold on
Tell you said to see you back
Don't dance to nothing back
Bang bang bang come so I only stay away
Lately
Don't don't don't don't see them
Dash it dash it dash it
Come get'em let's get real
Stance it oh nothing back
Nætram danser lækken læk
Tam-tam dans, dans for lær, slækker jækker hei
Tam-tam, tam-tam, silan kose då og dæj
Kom denne muskelle og stanser om nætten læk
Merketna ef bida
Må leifer bida din for, åh
Omfassen seg i solsen då det til en fæssig
Mm, Latin clothes, oh, wooden vehicle
In the neighborhood, I got ties that didn't you build
Dumb dumb dumb, so let them like
Dumb dumb dumb,'cause I don't have a snake
Let it lick
Dumb dumb dumb dumb, chillin' over, dive, dive
Hold that and let's get loud
Sounds so old, let them like
Don't don't don't don't let me back
Don't don't don't don't let me back
