Feel the beat, feel the trance, understand, learn, uh, let's go
And now she can't do four, four, four, four
Move your body, swing it low
Tine hænder opp, let it show
Together we dance, I feel, sit with me
So thrilled, chill, thrill
Dance all night, nættet lang
Let's party, sing this song
Dance, dance, hit it, let me
Feel the vibe, don't stop, come on
Vægtløske løs, hænding breit
Læs bli høgt, simmer og leg
Når vi danser, føles så rigtig
Everything feels so alright
Right, right
Heart beat racing for a day
Feel the rhythm never quit
Tell me hun I'll be with you together forever
We'll fit, fit, fit
Fit
Move your body swing it low
Din hender hender ander alle
Hender hender bliver ni så brød
We'll fit, fit, fit
Dance all night, depth in love
Let's party, sing this song
Dance, dance, hit the nuttin'
Feel the vibe, never stoppin'
Uh-huh, move your body, swing it low
Demon hammer up, let it show
Together we dance, no fear, stay with me
So thrill, so thrill, thrill, uh-huh, uh-huh
Dance all night, men line, let's party
Everybody sing the song, dance, dance, dance
Feeling like I feel revived, never stopping, ah-ah-ah
Head's high speed, shining bright
Lost the heart to moonlight
Now we dance so good, so ready
Everything feel good, feel so alright, alright
Ride, ride, lake to school, you're shining bright
Let's be hearts in one line
Now we dance our blues, I'll let it
Everything feels so alright
Ride, heartbeat racing, får du det?
Feel the rhythm, never quit
Tell me on our beautiful together forever
We'll fit, feel, fit, fit
Dance all night, death and light
Let's party, sing this song
Dance, dance, hele natten
Feel the light never stopping
