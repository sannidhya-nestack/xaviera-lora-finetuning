Drifting through the morning haze
Sunrise sets the sky ablaze
Gentle breeze it whispers slow
Take it easy, take it slow
Walking down these quiet streets
Life is simple, life is sweet
Every moment feels so light
Day turns into perfect night
Time just seems to float away
Let the rhythm guide your day
Find your peace in simple things
Hear the happiness it brings
Perfect place it breathes
Hear the happiness
