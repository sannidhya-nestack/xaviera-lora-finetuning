In the quiet of the evening
Where the city lights are gleaming
I find a place where I can be
Lost in dreams just you and me
Walking through the cobblestone
Feeling like I'm not alone
Whispers of the breeze so fine
Carrying tales of olden times
Underneath the northern sky
Stars are shining, don't ask why
In this moment, calm and true
I find peace when I'm with you
Floating on a gentle sea
Waves are soft they comfort me
Harmonies in every sound
As the night begins to gown
In the silence hear the call
Echoes from a distant hall
Melodies that drift and sway
Painting hues of twilight grey
Beneath the moon's soft silver light
Nature hums and all feels right
