Come on, come on, do the flip
Midnight sky is full like a gem
It's even got your love something new, ooh
Waiting here just dreaming'bout you
Yeah I can see that you're in that den
Your silhouette just a bit thin
And I'm not home please come by
Heart is aching don't know why
Waiting for my Mr. Lover
For a tumble see if you could cover cover
Sing a kumquat in your underglow
Calling out please come him
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hope I do when the clouds fill
Stars above seem to glare
Leading rocker, yeah, fifth in your head
Reaching out for mine, yeah, we're lickin' the hill
Time just standing still, I swear
Hoa vhe alintit tu
Indi ka ma hetima nu
Waiting for my Mr. Lover
Hoa tumu snigingak ka baga
Singa kumpatina on the go
Calling out, please come here now
Waiting for my Mr. Lover (oh no, Mr. Lover)
But I'm almost digging like a cover girl
Singa-kong-tung-ti-na on the floor (on the floor)
Calling out, "Please come, him"
