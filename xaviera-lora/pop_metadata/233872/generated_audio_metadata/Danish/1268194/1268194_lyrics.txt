In a land where silence whispers
Underneath the northern sky
We'll find the calm that lingers
As the days and nights pass by
Beneath the stars so distant
In a world of endless light
We lose our sense of time here
In the cool and quiet night
Chill and let your worries fall
Feel the peace, embrace the flow
In the space where we belong
Let the gentle breezes blow
On the shores of tranquil waters
Where the waves kiss sandy ground
We'll lay our dreams and ponder
In this haven we have found
Take a breath and close your eyes
Listen to the ocean sing
In this place of simple beauty
Where our hearts feel everything
Shall I let your worries fall?
Feel the peace, embrace the flow
In the space where we belong
Let the gentle breezes blow
In this land of endless wonder
Where the time moves slow and free
We'll find our dreams together
In the beauty of the sea
