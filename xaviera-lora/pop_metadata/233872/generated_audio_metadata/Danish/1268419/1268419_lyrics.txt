In the calm of the night
Where the stars are bright
We let our worries fade
In this tranquil serenade
Waves gently kiss the shore
Time whispers wanting more
Breathe in the simple peace
In this moment we release
Underneath the moon soft glow
We let the silence grow
Dreams flow like a quiet stream
In this world of gentle gleams
Floating on the evening breeze
Hearts unwind at ease
We'll lose our sense of time
In this rhythmic lullaby
Let your mind walk
Harmony inside
In these peaceful tides we glide
Eyes closed the night unfolds
Stories softly told
We find ourselves anew
In this calm with skies so blue
Gently as the night proceeds
In this air our hearts are free
Smiling in the twilight's light
We drift together'til daylight
