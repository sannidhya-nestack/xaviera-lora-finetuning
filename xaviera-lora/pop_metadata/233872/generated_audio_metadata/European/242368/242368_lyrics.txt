Oh when I close my eyes
I see you but I can't sleep
My mind is drifting
To the memory of your arms
And the light that warmed the painting
That had opened in our dreams
Renaissance lovers
An untold scene
You can't imagine how I feel when you love me with your eyes
And though I'm lying here in bed alone
My heart's gone off to fly
Through the night and over beaches
To settle down right next to you
And breathe the air you're breathing
My sweet friend in love with you
Here, let me write the music that was missing in the car
Ah, here we are, we've come so far
And the night became a miracle of years of loving
Raining from the stars, da da da da
And the sound of utter silence was the space to hear your heart beat
In the timelessness that started with your mouth pressed up to mine
And the light that filled our minds that night was only a reflection
Of the love that holds the world in place
And drives us through that endless space
Where God and angels sing
And where by chance one night I saw your face, sweet friend
You make my heart ache and sing at the same time
