Regent Summons, you're always on my mind
Like tender lovers who share a glass of wine
So un ettable, so divine
You're so incredible and you're mine
Parisian summers, whispers in the dawn
You're like no other, living in a song
Forevermore you'll be ever near
Parisian summer, come to me my dear
Parisian summers, the cafes in the sun
The leaves above us shading us as one
When love was new, memories came true
Parisian summer, let me come to you
Yes, you, I love you
I do
Parisian summers
I love you
