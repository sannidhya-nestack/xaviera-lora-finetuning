Fair lady, come follow me
You have been all you could be
It's not the place for you to be
It's over now, you'll come with me
And you, like every other
Will go down below and enter
Stop begging please, your time is over
Step on my boat, we'll cross the border
It ruined your life, your flesh, your soul forever
Come with me, follow me into the darkness
Smiled on her with a crooked smile
No one of his own
There's a chance you can dance
Let's move around
I'll talk you through
Your fits must move
If you can keep it up
You'll see the
Don't, but if you stop, I'll do my part
Your death do us part
