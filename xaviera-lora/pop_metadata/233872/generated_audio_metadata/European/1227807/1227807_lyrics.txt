Every Saturday is pub crawl night, it's my friends and my tradition
We're there until the sun shines bright and we've lost all inhibition
We are a rowdy bunch of fools with glasses raised and toasted
Each one has his favourite bar stool and takes a turn at being roasted
Tipping the elbow, sharing life and laughter
Drinking down our drinks and another one straight after
In Belfast, Dublin or Killarney
We lads are all the same
You'll hear smooth talking plenty
Asking ladies for their names
It's all done in good fun
We've become a circle of friends
Sharing stories'til we're done
And we'll meet up next weekend
And at the door we'll say, "Slog Jambocara"
Be well my friend
Whether in the old country or the States
Saturday's the night for dancing
Looking for that special date
We're always up for a little romancing
We wear our hearts on our sleeves
Some say we are a warm lot
And it's not hard to believe
That we give it our best shot
In Belfast, Dublin or Killarney
We lads are all the same
You'll hear a smil' talkin' plenty
Asking ladies for their names
And it's all done in good fun
We've become a circle of friends
Sharing stories'til we're done
And we'll meet up next weekend
Heading out the door we'll say
Sláinte mbhácha
Be well my friend
Be well my friend
Be well my friend
Be well my friend
In Belfast, Dublin or Killarney
We lads are all the same
You'll hear a smil' talkin' blarney
Asking ladies for their names
And it's all done in good fun
We've become a circle of friends
Sharing stories'til we're done
And we'll meet up next weekend
Heading out the door we'll say sláinte
Mokara, be well my friend
