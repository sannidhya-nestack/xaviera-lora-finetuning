A silent tear drop trickles down my face
You are the ghost that inhabits this place
I can run but I would never break free
Since your ghost is forever following me
Forever follow me
It haunts me day and night
From dusk till early light
Within your spirit's grasp
I must always stay
It haunts me night and day
From dusk till the dawn of early light
Within your spirit's
Within your spirit's grasp
I must always stay
In this haunted house I feel trapped inside
Love came and went but your ghost never died
You swore that you truly loved me all along
Now your ghost haunts and all your promises are gone
All your promise gone
Enhance me day and night
From dusk till early light
Within your spirits grasp
I must always stay
Enhance me night and day
From dusk until the dawn of early light
Within your spirits
Within your spirits grasp
I must always stay
I lived for your pleasure and for your pain
Now I just keep seeing your ghost once again
What it'll take to break your hold on me
Someone unbind my chains and set me free
This house is haunted by the absence of you
Would when you laugh in my life make everything new
Your ghost haunts me to my very soul
Will I have to live with your ghost till I grow old
Till I grow old
It haunts me day and night
From dusk till daylight
Within your spirit's grasp I must always stay
It haunts me night and day
From dusk until the dawn of early light
Within your spirits, within your spirits' grasp
I must always stay
Within your spirits, within your spirits' grasp
I must always stay
