The moonlight hums a gentle tune
A symphony beneath the moon
The strings they sing of love and pain
Their voices dancing in the rain
Cries soft and low
Its tale of sorrow starts to grow
That shallow answer's deep and wide
A river flowing with the tide
Oh strings that whisper through the night
Your melody takes wings in flight
You hold the wind
A story told where hearts must go
A harp would pluck the stars above
Its echoes filled with boundless love
The viola weaver goes
A harmony where dreams have fled
The music swells, it fills the air
A universe beyond compare
Each note a world, a fleeting spark, a light that glimmers in the dark
Oh strings that whisper through the night
Your melody takes wings and flies
You hold the world within your bow
A story told where hearts must go
