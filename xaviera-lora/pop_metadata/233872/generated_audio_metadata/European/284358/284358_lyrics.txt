Italian wine, blue moonlit sky
The night for two spells, amore
A river walk in Venice light
With gentle breeze spells, amore
When you wake with a laughter
The morning after
Spells amore, amore for you
A city view, a table for two
So high above it spells amore
From candlelight, brown eyes delight
The time is right for amore
When you wake with a laughter
The morning after spells amore
Amore for you
When you wake with a laughter
The morning after spells amore
Amore
For you, for you, for you
