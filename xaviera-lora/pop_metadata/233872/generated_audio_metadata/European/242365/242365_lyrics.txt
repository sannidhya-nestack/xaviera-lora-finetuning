Sitting in the pub, reading the paper. Queens Boulevard pub, the usual caper.
Sexy waitress with a northern smile
I'll be your beloved in a little while
TV, GAA games on in the corner
Everyone cheers, me they're playing a stormer
It's a Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon
It's a Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon
First pint for the hangover, second for tomorrow's
And the third and the fourth and the fifth and the sixth
Oh how quick the day goes
Sunday afternoon in a pub in Queen's Boulevard
Foul on the TV, someone gets a red card
it's a Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon
It's a Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon
Live from Ireland, then the band arrives
Days are getting shorter, but we'll all survive
Till the next week anyway, then the week after
Crams to the door, sound of someone's laughter
It's the sexy waitress and the boys from Armagh
Green football shirts and blah blah blah
It's a Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon
It's a Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon
October Sundays, evening comes
Out into the night then with the other bums
Or maybe a little further down the road
Somewhere else to lay down my weary load
Oh sexy waitress with the northern smile
I'll be over love in a little while
it's a Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon
It's a Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon
It's a Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon
It's a Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon
