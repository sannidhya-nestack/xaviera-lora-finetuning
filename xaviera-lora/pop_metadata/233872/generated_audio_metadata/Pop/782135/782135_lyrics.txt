Can you sing this high, no here
Nothing here is ever clear
She only left you'cause you asked
There's nothing subtle'bout that laugh
Black and blue from your devotion
Save your breath, mister backwards motion
You must be joking with those shades
Go home get cleaned up at your age
You never showed her who you are oh no
Not that they'd lost you, Brad, hell no
Access denied with your favors and your lies
She only left you'cause you asked
She's never ever coming back
This city blocks ten miles long
Oh no, not that
Get lost, you rat
Help not access denied with your favors and your lies
