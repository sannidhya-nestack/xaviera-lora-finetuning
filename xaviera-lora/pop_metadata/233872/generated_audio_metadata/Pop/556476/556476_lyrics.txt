I'm trying to write this song
Got the meter and the rhyme wrong
The road was crowded with strange faces
While you chose to write into my heart
Mixed metaphors are all I have to describe what I feel for you
Mixed metaphors are all I have to describe what I feel for you
I'm trying to find the words
Turning away from your candlelit smile
The taxi was right at the corner
But I walked on a million hot stopping miles
Mixed metaphors are all I have to describe
What I see and feel
Mixed metaphors are all I have to describe what I feel for you
Words are all gone haywire
The grammar seems so messy
The sentences don't flow
And now I'm left without a syllable
How to describe what I feel for you?
Mixed metaphors are all I have to describe what I feel for you
Mixed metaphors are all I have to describe what I feel for you
Mixed metaphors are all I have to describe what I feel for you
What I feel for you
Makes the matter further on what I feel for you
Makes the matter further on I have to describe what I feel for you
Makes the matter further on I have to describe what I feel for you
