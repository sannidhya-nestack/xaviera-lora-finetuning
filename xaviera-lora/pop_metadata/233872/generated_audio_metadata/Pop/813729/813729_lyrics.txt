Is it far too kind
Or easier to bring myself to this
But if I should stay
If I should stay
Well I wonder what I'll miss
Everything she does she drives me crazy
Everything she does she captivates me
And now I cannot ive
I will not et
The walls caving
The sky falls down
And my world stands still
When she falls to the ground
And all that's good
And all we are
Will shatter like glass
When she falls to the ground
Everything she does she drives me crazy
Everything she does she captivates me
Now I cannot ive
I will not ive
Everything's gone wrong
And it's always down to you
Don't tell me why it's always been this way
Falling down
Everything she does, she drives me crazy
Everything she does, she captivates me
And now I cannot ive
I will not et
No, I will not et
