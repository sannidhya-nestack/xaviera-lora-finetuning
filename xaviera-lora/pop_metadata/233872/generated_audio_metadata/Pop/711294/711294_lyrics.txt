The city is all muddled like a badly written haiku
Jumbled like the traffic passing with images of you
The lights stream by like an urban outing's palette
Shimmering mirages of dreams ahead of you
As I walk by the 9th street station
I see your reflection in the glass moon
As I walk by the 9th street station
Your shadow eclipses me and follows me home
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-La
The river's twisting and turning like a log kite in the sky
Fluttering, caught up with memory boats of youth
The people rush by, enter and exit like it's a play
Intense and complex like Shakespeare wrote all new
As I walk by the 9th street station
I see your reflection in the glass moon
As I walk by the 9th street station
Your shadow eclipses me and follows me home
The trains ride up and down, hardly caring about me or you
Twisting and turning like knitting needles round my woolen mind
The stations drift by like ghosts on silver smoke screens
Flickering and burning, neon signs of my life
As I walk by the 9th street station
I see your reflection in the glass moon
As I walk by the 9th street station
Your shadow eclipses me and swallows me whole
As I walk by the 9th street station
I see your realization in the glass moon
As I walk by the 9th street station
Your shadow eclipses me and swallows me whole
