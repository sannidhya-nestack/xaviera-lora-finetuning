Skinny dipping on the moon
That's what angels like to do
On a quiet night in paradise
You're on an astral plane
On earth I must remain
So I leave my dream on ice
If heaven had a phone
I'd call you everyday
Just to hear your voice
And maybe after that we would have a laugh
You wouldn't be alone if heaven had a phone
You were my saving grace
When you left without a trace
Now I sing myself to sleep
Feel I've been put on hold
Caught waiting in the cold
I leave my message at the beep
If heaven had a phone (If only heaven had a phone)
I'd call you everyday (I swear I'd call you everyday)
Just to hear your voice
And maybe after that (maybe after that)
We would have a laugh (we would have a laugh)
I wouldn't be alone
If heaven had a phone
Sometimes the silence is deafening
What I wouldn't give
To hear you answer my ring
If heaven had a phone (If only heaven had a phone)
I'd call you everyday (I said I'd call you everyday)
Just to hear your voice
And maybe after that (maybe after that)
We would have a laugh (we would have a laugh)
We wouldn't be alone
If heaven had a phone
I'd be coming home
If heaven had a phone
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
