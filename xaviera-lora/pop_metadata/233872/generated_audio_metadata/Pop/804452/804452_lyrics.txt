Look at that, look at that
How to run a stop sign
Waiting on a green light, talking in the meantime
Dressed to the nines
Like cherries on a vine
Like bubblegum snapping, yapping, yapping
Ain't nothing happening, happening, nah
Girls talk about girls
Boys talk about girls
Men talk about girls
Women talk about money
Money
Look at you, look at you
Hotter than a match head
Thinking you can talk Ted, wonder what the chick said
Caught in a spin, that hole that you're in
You keep on drippin', flippin', zippin'
And doing it again, yeah
Girls talk about girls
Boys talk about girls
Men talk about girls
Women talk about money
Can't be your description of women, that's fiction
If I've got to go, that will be my decision
I'll take care of me and the world that I live in alone, alone, alone
Girls talk about girls (yeah)
Boys talk about girls (yeah)
Men talk about girls (yeah)
Women talk about money
I, I gon' get me some
Follow me while she come
I, I gon' get me some
Follow me while she come
Girls talk about girls
Boys talk about girls
Men talk about girls
Women talk about money
Money, money
You know it honey
So, where's my money?
