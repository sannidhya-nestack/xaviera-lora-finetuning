Another night of despair
I sit and pray for my child somewhere out there
She's a little girl in the big world
Hope she's warm and well
I wish she'd ride or just call
To ease my mind it's so hard when you don't know
She's a little girl in the big world
Just a little girl
I know we had our problems for some time
I ignored the warnings, oh so blind
To lose the only real love of mine
A child alone on the streets
I'm so afraid of the stories we all read
She's a little girl in the big world
Hope she's warm and well
I know we had our problems for some time
I ignored the warnings, oh so blind
To lose the only reason
Of the mind
If I close my eyes there's a way
Not giving up'til the day she's back to stay
She's a little girl in the big world
Hope she's warm and well
She's a little girl in a big world
Just a little girl
She's a little girl in the great big world
I hope she's warm
And will
