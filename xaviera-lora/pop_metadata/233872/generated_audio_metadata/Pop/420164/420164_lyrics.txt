Jamie's a dreamer when she's got her heart set on something
You know that she will never stop
And Jamie's a leader but she's down right now
Needs a breath, needs a break to find a little space
She's lost in the crowd, yeah she's coming down
She's crying out loud, yeah, she's coming down
But her mother's hands can't save her this time
And she's pulling farther away from the light
Jamie's a fighter but she's giving up
Letting go, walking life down to an empty road
Jamie's a writer, she pours out her heart
Onto a page she's trying to erase today
She's lost in the crowd, yeah she's coming down
She's crying out loud
Yeah she's coming down
But her mother's hands can't save her this time
And she's pulling farther away from the light
Now oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
She's lost in the crowd, yeah she's coming down
She's crying out loud, yeah she's coming down
But her mother's hands can't save her this time
And she's pulling farther away from the light
But her mother's hands can't save her this time
And she's pulling farther away from the light
Now
Jamie's a dreamer
