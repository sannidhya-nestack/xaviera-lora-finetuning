Now I, I don't have money
So I go ahead and count my dimes
And you, you think it's funny
you know how to make me cry
You've all
Guilty of this sin, yeah
And you think that you can push me around, yeah
And you think that you can knock me down
Well think again
You might as well think again
Yeah, yeah
Now I lost my confidence
you took it all away
And the things you said, you know they made no sense
But I can still hear those words you say
You've always been
Guilty of this sin
Yeah
And you think that you can push me around
Yeah
And you think that you can knock me down
Well think again
You might as well think again
Ooh yeah yeah
So where do I find my self-esteem?
You know, you strip me of my dignity
And I will not et
Because this is, this is, this is, this is the day of reckoning
You've always been guilty of this sin, yeah
And you think that you can push me around, yeah
And you'll think that you can knock me down
Well think again
You might as well think again
Ooh yeah yeah
Woah woah woah
