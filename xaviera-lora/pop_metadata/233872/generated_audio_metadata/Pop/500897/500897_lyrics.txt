I'll take the highway
I'll take the highway home
'Cause that's where I wanna go
That's where I need to go
Please help me get back home
That's where I wanna go
That's where I need to go
Please help me get back home
Lost in a foreign town
Can't seem to catch my breath
Drowning in a pool of tears
All I wanna do is get back home
that's where I wanna go
That's where I need to go
Please help me get back home
'Cause that's where I wanna go
That's where I need to go
Please help me get back home
I'll take the highway
I'll take the highway
I'll take the highway home
