Things said today in life remain
Some hope to overflow
One night to come
Only chance to know you're not alone
My feelings show
But it's over, over, over
Only chance, only chance, only chance, only chance, only chance
With time we change our life, our faith
But still so insecure
What keeps you high?
What holds you low?
Somehow we'll never know
But it's over, over
Over
