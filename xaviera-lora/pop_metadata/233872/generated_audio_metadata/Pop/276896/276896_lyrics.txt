I've tried a million different ways
But I can't make you stay
I moved the heavens and the earth to be with you
But I can't stop your world from drifting away
I keep paying the price and counting the cost
Of fighting this war that I've already lost
I will take a deep breath
I will close my eyes and let you walk away
Let you walk away
I will take a deep breath
Try not to let my feelings show
I will be strong won't let my feelings show
I spoke a million different words
But I can't make you hear (you never listen)
I've given a hundred and one reasons to you
But the message just gets lost
And all the meaning disappears
I'm hanging up the gloves
And throwing this fight
I know that I can't win
It's an aimless fight
I will take a deep breath
I will close my eyes
And let you walk away
Let you walk away
I will take a deep breath
Try not to let my feelings show
I will be strong
Won't let my feelings show
I can make a fool of myself
Time after time
Keep hiding from the facts
It's the end of the line
Maybe I can change the world
But I couldn't change your heart
Maybe I should wait for a miracle
But the time would tear me apart
Tear me apart, ooh
I will take a deep breath
I will close my eyes and let you walk away
Let you walk away
I will take a deep breath
Try not to let my feelings show
I will be strong won't let my feelings show
I will take a deep breath
I will close my eyes and let you walk away
Let you walk away
I will take a deep breath
Try not to let my feelings show (I won't let my feelings show)
I will be strong, won't let my feelings show
Won't let my feelings show, won't let my feelings show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won' let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feeling show, won't let my feelings show. Won't let my feelings show. Won't let my feelings shine. Won't let my feelings shine. Won't make you walk away. Won't make you walk away. Won't make you walk away. Won't make you walk away. Won't make you walk away. Won't make you walk away. Won't make you walk away. Won't make you walk away. Won't make you walk away. Won't make you walk away.
