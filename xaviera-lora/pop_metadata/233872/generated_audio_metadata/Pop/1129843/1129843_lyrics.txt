I got a feeling there's something real about this love
My head is reeling in the most unusual way
The blue skies never looked so blue
But I'm not blue today
I got a feeling
And I like feeling this way
The birds are singing
Right outside of my window
And it's bringing a feeling that's making my day
when I hear those birds just singing
Feels like summer's here to stay
I got a feeling and I like feeling this way
I've had some painful yesterdays
Some loves that never bloom
Gonna push those memories aside
Gonna make some more room
A sweet romance is rolling down my avenue
A new chance gonna embrace a new day
And nothing's gonna stop me now
Here I come now, come what may
I got a feeling
And I like feeling this way
I got a feeling
And I like feeling this way
