This is the day, this is the moment
Let's come together now and lift our voices
Hold back nothing and speak up loud
This is our moment in time
Hey, what are you doing all alone?
We'll never solve this on our own
Now we're gonna stand up, stand up
Never gonna let them take us down today
Gotta keep our head up, head up
you know they only want it their own way, aye
Never give up
Don't you know they're gonna fight you all the way
So when you're big
Feel that you can't go on
Stand up,'cause today's a new day
This has been a long time coming
Keeping silent when there's something to say
They'll only listen when they can't ignore us
We stand together, they can't push us away
Hey, what are you doing?
All along, they'll never solve this on our own
Now we're gonna stand up, stand up
Never gonna let them take us down today
Gotta keep our head up, head up
you know they only want it their way, aye
Never give up
Don't you know they're gonna fight you all the way
So when you're there
That you can't go on
Stand up, today's a new day
Two steps forward and no steps back
But I'll keep it up and lift those hands
Never give up, give in, let's go, let's get started
I feel you rising, I see you, I see you, I see you
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh
Stand up, stand up
Never gonna let them take us down today
Gotta keep our head up, head up
you know they only want it their own way, aye
Never give up
Don't you know they're gonna fight you all the way
So when you feel that, you can't go on
Stand up, stand up
Never gonna let them take us down today
Gotta keep our head up, head up
you know they only want it their way, aye
Never give up
Don't you know they're gonna fight you all the way
So when you feel that you can't go on
Stand up, today's a new day
Stand up today's a new day
