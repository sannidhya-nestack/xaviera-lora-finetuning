Come and cool out with the Eagle Gang
You're on the right track if you're down with my thang
Cruise the opposition with an eagle eye
This ain't no drive-by'cause I'm a hell of a guy
Go where I go, I know what I know
I got nothing to show until I strip out with the ladies
Bang, this is my hang
It's a beautiful thing when you got it going on
Do you remember when the UFO flavor was a big fat groove in the room?
Do you remember when the U4 flavor was a big fat groove in the room
Everybody was jumping
The bass player was thumping
The only thing that was missing
Is hip-hop, is hip-hop, swing
Just another song, it won't be too long before I hit you with the hook and then I got you
I'll let you dance around the room'cause I'm a girl watching
Now let me show you around,'cause pound for pound, it's an old school sound, it's goin' twelve rounds
Well does it make you wanna sing? (Yeah)
Does it make you wanna move? (Yeah)
Anybody betcha? (Nah)
Do you remember when the UFO flavor was a big fat groove in the room?
Do you remember when the UFO flavor was a big, fat groove in the room?
Everybody was moving
The drummer man was groovin'
The only thing that was missing
Is zip top, is zip top
Do you remember when the euphor flavor was a big fat groove in the room
Do you remember when the euphor flavor was big fat groove in the room
Do you remember when the euphor flavor was the big fat groove in the room
Do you remember when the UFO flavor was a big fat groove in the room?
Hey, remember

Do you remember
Do do do do do do do do do

Got to got to remember
