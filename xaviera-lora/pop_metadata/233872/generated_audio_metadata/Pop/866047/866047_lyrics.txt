Medusa's eyes will leave you blind
They turn your heart to stone, your soul to ice
Put on your shades, don't ever gaze
Into those eyes
Maybe a better plan instead
Hold a mirror right before our head
Give her a taste of what it's like
To see, see those eyes
Don't look into Medusa's eyes
Or you'll live to regret it
Don't look into Medusa's eyes
Or you'll live to regret it
Don't look into Medusa's eyes
Just turn away
Athena or Andromeda
What be a better choice if love is what you want
Whatever you do
Don't look into, into, into those eyes
Don't look into those eyes
Or you'll live to regret it
Don't look into my jewels and sights
Or you'll live to regret it
Don't look into my jewels and sights
Just turn away, away
The jewels and sights
It should come, there's no surprise
I was never good at following advice
I'm hypnotized forever by, by, by those eyes
Don't look into a doozy's eyes or you'll live to regret it
Don't go into Medusa's eyes, or you'll live to regret it
Don't go into Medusa's eyes, just turn away (away, away, away)
Medusa's eyes will leave you blind
They turn your heart to stone, your soul to ice
Put on your shades, don't ever gaze into
Those eyes, or you'll be forever mesmerized, mesmerized
Don't look into me (don't you look to regret)
I don't look into you (don't you look to regret)
I don't look into you (just turn away)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
