I give in, you slip through my barricade
I've hidden feelings that I'm scared to face
Behind camouflage
I fear this fate
I'm deeply in love with you
Too pleasing
Each sweet part of you completely is everything I need
Because my soft skin, it longs for you
Each breath in, belongs to you
You're deep in, so deeply in my heart
That is all I know
You seep through
Flesh into my soul
I'm helplessly bound in rapture with you
I'm deeply in love with you
Too pleasing
Each sweet part of you completely
Is why I'm in this world
Because my soft skin
It longs for you
Each breath in
Belongs to you
Your deep end
So deeply in my heart
