I want nothing more than one or two or maybe three
I have something better, hope of a chance, a possibility
Walk with me in the garden
When I'm already half asleep
Stay with me'til the morning
Then I'll be yours to keep
Loneliness makes you doubt yourself and you doubt you deserve it at all
Back and forth, a tug of war between your pity and pride
Dance with me in the garden
When I'm already half asleep
Wake me in the morning
Then I'll be yours to keep
Then I'll be yours to keep
