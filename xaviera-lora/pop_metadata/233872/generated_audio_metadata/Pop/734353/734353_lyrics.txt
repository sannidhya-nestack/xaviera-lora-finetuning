You do do do do do do do
You do do do do do do do
You do do do do do do do
I didn't know
I'd stumble upon you
Was it fate or was it purely luck? Yes, it must've been luck
Lucky to me, lucky as one can be
Love me fully, truly, is this real? Is it all just a dream?
It's a white house with a picket fence and green grass
You want it a million and baby no one fits the puzzle piece so perfectly like you do
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
I'll be any fantasy, oh
Treat you as sweet as cotton candy, oh
Tears of joy will only shatter my love
My love in here
Stance, a man who won't only take my hand
But understands that no one can, it takes me just the way that I am
It's a white house with a picket fence and green grass
You're one in a million
Baby, no one fits the puzzle piece so perfectly like you do
It's a white beach with a pretty sunset
A white light, it's picture perfect
I can't pick up a single one
Just gonna love the way that you do
You, and too
You know you've got me wrapped around your finger
And if you ask me if I wanted to stay later
I'd say neither
I want to stay forever
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Oh oh
It's a white
House with the thicket fence and green grass
You want it a million and baby no
If this a puzzle piece so perfectly I can do it too
It's a white beach with a pretty sunset
A white light, it's picture perfect
I can't think of a single one that's gonna love the way that you do
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
