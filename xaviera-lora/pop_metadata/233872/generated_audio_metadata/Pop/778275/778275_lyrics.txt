(indistinct)
We come undone
Between days, between nights we crawl
We call for love
Between the days, between the nights, we call
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just gotta feel right, feel right, feel right, feel right, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just gotta feel right
We call for love
Between days, between nights we call
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We call for love
Between days, between nights we call
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
