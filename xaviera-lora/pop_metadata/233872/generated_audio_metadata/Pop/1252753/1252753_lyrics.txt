Pivot dreams around me, colors swirl day and night
See the patterns floating high underneath the starry sky
Magic in our hands we hold, whisper softly secrets told
Walk along this winding road, bright designs our hearts unfold
Days lead me into your life
Paint your world with shades so bright
Together we can dance in light
In this dream we take our flight
Laughter echoes through the air
In this moment of the rare
Crazy love beyond compare
You are your perfect pair
Facing me into your life
Paint your world with shades so bright
Together we can dance in light
In this dream we take our flight
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Hold my hand don't let it go
Feel the waves of colors flow
In this tapestry we sew
Watch our love forever grow
Hazy me into your life
Paint your world with shades so bright
Together we can dance in light
In this dream we take our flight
Hold my hand, don't let it go
Feel the waves of colors flow
In this tapestry we sew
Watch our love forever grow
