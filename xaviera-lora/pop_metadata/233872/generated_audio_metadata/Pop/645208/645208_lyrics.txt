Biding time in a hurricane, sigh in a hurricane, sigh I'm hiding out
In a whimsical dream and a picture unreal in its scenery
Probing blindly for sturdy firm ground
Search the horrible sound to lean upon
While a constant alarm makes my senses disarmed into shield mode
Make me fly, make me fly
Sky out to everywhere
Let me scrutinize the wonders of the world
Make me fly, make me fly
Sky out to everyone and to everywhere
Talking loud in her gutsy tones
How I'd be making my proudness suffocate
When you're never uptight and got everything right
It is easy
Spinning round in oblivious times
Every warning sign drowns in irony
In a quest for relief
By the imminent deed of a lifetime
Make me fly, make me fly
Sky out to everywhere
Let me scrutinize the wonders of the world
Make me fly, make me fly
Sky out to everyone and to everywhere
