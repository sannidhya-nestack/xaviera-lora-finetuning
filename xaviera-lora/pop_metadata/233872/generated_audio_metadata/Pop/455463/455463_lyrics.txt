I'll be your holy cow
I'll be your fighting sow
I'll be your long lost brother
I'll be your sacred vow
I'll be your dutiful wife
I'll be your lust for life
I'll be your road to Mecca
I'll be your sharpen knife
Ooh, such a beautiful face

I'll be your brain of rice
I'll be your full attention
I'll be your twice as nice

My congratulations, do you feel all?
My expectations, can you save me?
If I dine at your table, can you see me?
Looking through your window?
