We walk hand in hand through the snow
Ice crystals dancing so
You're warmth in my embrace, we are two
Here in a world where time stands still
And we travel together, you and I
Through snow or sand, it's our day
In the sun or under the sky, so white
You are my journey, my love, my life
When the sun rises over a golden sea
Or when we see stars fall in the night's plea
With you every place feels like a dream
We create memories where time does not end
And we travel together, you and I
Through snow or sand, it's all day
In the sun or under the sky, so white
You are my journey, my love, my life
No matter where we go, no matter where we stand
With you every step feels so right, so clear
We travel together, my love, my friend
I wanna travel with you again and again
When the sun rises over a golden sea
Or when we see stars fall in the night's plea
With you every place feels like a dream
We create memories where time does not end
No matter where we go, no matter where we stand
With you every step feels so right, so clear
We travel together, my love, my friend
I want to travel with you again and again
