Geary and Vine
There's a lady there she looks so fine
Every morning as she walks by I see her
Do anything to be there as she makes her way
She makes my day, she looks so sweet
Like the sun she lights that city street
I approach her and I strike a conversation
But it's just my imagination
I'm tongue-tied, her kyrian vine
What could someone like her ever see in a fool like me
A delivery man driving the streets
Lugging the goods from my van
Geary and vine
As close as her world ever gets to mine
I'm just dreaming'cause I know that I'm not her type
She needs a man in pinstripes, fancy shoes
Handsome and smooth but I'll be okay
I can live with just that moment each day
When I see you there a vision in the sunlight
I'm living for that one light that I see
Down on Girion Vine
Girion Vine
On the corner there at Girion Vine
I see my angel there at Girion Vine
Geary and Vine
