I'll see the rain drops on my door
And I'll see the clouds moving on the floor
I know that our time is running out
Give me your love and show me how
To feel what you feel
To live how you live
I'll give it all
To see what you see
And you did all the night
You did all the night
Oh oh oh oh oh
Mmm
I'll see the rain drops on my door
And I see the clouds moving on the floor
To feel what you feel, to live how you live
I'll give it all, to see what you see
And you did it all night
You did it all night
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I'll see the rain drops on my door
And I'll see the clouds moving on the floor
I know that our time is running out
Give me your love and show me how
To feel what you feel
To live how you live
I'll give it all
To see what you see
And you did all the night
You did all the night
Oh oh oh
Mmm mmm mmm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
