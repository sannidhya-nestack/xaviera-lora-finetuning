One, two, three, four
Why do you tell me to fly
When wings were never what you gave me
And why when I open up my eyes
Do I see that you can never save me
I try to change the way I feel
And everything that's real
About me, but you lied
To everyone including yourself made me believe
I'm just another weed under the trees
Let me grow till I can reach the sunlight
Let me go so I can find my way
Let me out of this place, so that I can retrace the old lines
That I drew in my cover of day
Take the blame, take the lead
From the books that contains your own weight
Take my hand, let me show you
How you feel is really the same
When you're stuck in a freeze frame
Every time you tell me who I am
You're messing with my head
You build me and you break me down
Pick me up from the bottom to the top
Make me ready for the drop
But I'm not gonna fall this time around
Let me climb and stumble in my own way
Let me feel what it's like to be okay
On my own, even if the road's dark and alone
I will be free from my cover up days
Take the blame, take the lead
From the box that contains your old way
Take my hand, let me show you
How you feel is really the same
When you're stuck in a freeze frame
Take a picture for me baby
Take a picture and lean back
Do you think that I'm content now?
Always waving the right flag
Take a picture for me maybe
I will guess what's on your mind
Two dimensional invades me
I can't seem to get it right
