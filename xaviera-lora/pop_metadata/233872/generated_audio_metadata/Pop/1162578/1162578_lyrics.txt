Steady day dreaming about you
We were supposed to spend forever together
I can't even stand the thought of us not being together
Like a door without a key
Like a face without a name
I've been living so low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
I can't do this no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no more
I'm like a tree without its branches
A plant without its flower
I can't live this life without you
Maybe it's just my head, I'm still dreaming
Holla, holla, holla, holla at your man
I wanna know that this is just a dream
I love, I love, I love, I love me, baby
And I know that we can work this out
I love, I love, I love me, baby
Baby
Baby
Every day we do things that don't turn out right
Whatever makes us stronger this time
Living in the perfect sun doesn't ever work out right
Whenever we have a chance to make it right
I'm just a phone call away
Holla, holla, I'll be right here
I know you probably need some time
But I'll be right here
I've been living so low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
I can't do this no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no more
I'm like a tree without its branches
A flower without its flower
I can't live this life without you
Maybe it's just my head I'm still dreaming
Hala Hala Hala Hala at your man
I wanna know that this is just a dream
Holla, holla, holla, holla with me, baby
Then I know that we can work this out
Holla, holla, love me baby
Baby
Baby
