Ooh, play
Ooh
I see you here, I see you there, everywhere
Lost in your eyes, feel your sighs in the night
Oh
Stranger, won't you play, oh
Baby, all the way
When you're gone, I'm weak
Feeling high when you speak
Stranger, won't you play with me
It's so hot, can't you tell that I'm under your spell?
Stranger won't you play with me, play with me?
You in my hair, in my bed, don't et
More, give me more, don't you hide in the night
Stranger, won't you play, oh-oh
Baby, all the way
When you're gone, I'm weak
Feeling high when you speak
Stranger, won't you play with me?
It's so hard, can't you tell
That I'm under your spell?
Stranger, won't you play with me?
Stranger, danger, whenever you're in, whenever you're out
Feel me, heal me now, out
In the cold when you go, don't go, oh
Stranger won't you come and play with me
I need you all the way, all the way
When you're gone, I'm weak, feeling high
When you speak, stranger won't you play with me?
You're so hot, can't you tell that I'm under your spell?
Stranger won't you play with me?
When you're gone
Feeling high when you speak (you speak)
Stranger, won't you play with me? (Stranger, won't you play with me?)
You're so hot, can't you tell? (Can't you tell?)
That I'm under your spell (under your spell)
Stranger, won't you play with me?
Play with me
