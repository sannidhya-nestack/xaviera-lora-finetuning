Been watching you all night, night, night, night
Cause girl you look so right, right, right, right
I see you getting down, down, down, down
I feel the pulse around, round, round, round
DJ play me one more song
Girl you know the party's on
Dance like it's the last song
Move until your body hurts
Baby we can make this work
Dance like it's the last song
Come on tonight we'll do it right
After midnight
You know we can't do no wrong
What we got is going on
Dance like it's the last song (last song)
Last song
Oh oh ye ye
Oh oh ye ye ye
Oh oh ye ye
Oh oh
Your body's getting low low low low
You're moving nice and slow, slow, slow, slow
But what, what you mean watching you, you, you, you
And I know what we can do, do, do, do
DJ play me one more song
Girl you know the party's on
Dance like it's the last song
Move until your body hurts
Baby we can make this work
Dance like it's the last song
Come on tonight
We'll do it right
After midnight
You know we can't do no wrong but we got is going on
Dance like it's the last song (last song) (last song)
Oh oh eee oh oh eee oh oh eee oh oh eeee oh oh eeee oh oh eeee (last song)
Oh oh eee oh oh eee oh oh eeee oh oh eeee oh oh eeee (last song)
And I feel the countdown coming fast
We'll spend every second like it was our last
Until they turn the lights back on
DJ play me one more song
Girl you know the party's on
Dance like it's the last song
Move until your body hurts
Baby we can make this work
Dance like it's the last song
Come on tonight
We'll do it right
After midnight
You know we can't do no wrong what we got is going on
Dance like it's the last song (last song) (last song)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (last song)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (last song)
