A young boy learns quick how to make things go his way
Learns all about them and the things they say
He becomes a man and his heart turns cold
But that's just the beginning
He grows obsessed with the things he has and hasn't had
And the line blurs between the happy and sad
He takes a pill to change his will and numb his head
But nobody's winning
That's life, that's the way it goes
It moves so fast sometimes I know
Just like the movies filled with highs and lows
Sit back, enjoy the show
Oh, oh, oh, that's the way it goes
Oh, oh, oh, that's the way it goes
A young girl dreams and prays for things to get better
She wants to see the world but her mom won't let her
Moms afraid she'll lose her innocent heart
But the world is waiting
See this magic age
The world is still full of wonder
And nothing can break the spell that she's under
So she packs her bags and leaves her mom in tears
Worried and waiting
That's like just one big mystery
It burns in you, now it burns in me
Just like the old man said before he died
Sit back, enjoy the ride
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
That's the way it goes
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
That's the way it goes
It seems like there's too much to care about
What do you care?
It seems like there's too much to cry about
Can we get this figured out?
Yep, that's life
That's the way it goes
That's like, that's the way it goes
It moves so fast sometimes, I know
Just like a movie's filled with highs and lows
Sit back, enjoy the show
And that's life, that's love
Oh, that's the way it goes
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
That's life, that's the way it goes
