West side girls
Trouble through I'm through
They don't know about the way I feel for you
A secret love, a secret we must keep
Baby we are in much too deep
They say there is no looking back
Once you cross over the tracks
This is where our worlds divide
I don't care about what they say
We're not gonna throw away
Everything we feel inside
My Juliet, it's not over yet
I don't wanna see you cry
Don't wanna say goodbye
Are you willing to fly with me?
I don't know what we'll see
But we'll be together now and forever
You and I
We keep it low and meet late at night
I can see your body move with mine by candlelight
The beating of your heart tells everything you feel
That's meant all for show, this love is real
Past the point of no return
We played with fire, let's not get burned
Hold my hand and don't let go
No matter what they say or do
I will always be with you
Girl you know I love you so
My Juliet, it's not over yet
I don't wanna see you cry
I don't wanna say goodbye
Are you willing to fly with me?
I don't know what we'll see
We'll be together, now and forever
Hold on girl, hold on girl, hold on girl (baby hold on)
Hold on girl, hold on girl, hold on girl
My Juliet, it's not over yet
I don't wanna see you cry
I don't wanna say goodbye
Are you willing to fly with me?
I don't know what we'll see
But we'll be together, now and forever
My Juliet, it's not over yet
I don't wanna see you cry
Don't wanna say goodbye
Will you fly with me
I don't know what we'll see, but we'll be together
