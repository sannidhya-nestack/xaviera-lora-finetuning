Oh, got my sunglasses on, got my sunglasses on
We started off so right, blazing hot with kisses
Temperature was on the rise, we had it like this
I gave you all my sunshine
And all the clouds went missing
Yeah they say that love is blind (We had it like this, we had it like this)
Then you went and messed it all up
Guess what, I'm done, now go get your stuff now
Now you wishin' I was the one
Too bad, so sad'cause I'm movin' on
And now that we're done, I'll be lookin' up
Got my sunglasses on, got my sunglasses on
Days looking brighter since I've been so gone
Got my sunglasses on, got my sunglasses on
Could've been real good, some kinda perfect
It was cool but it went cold (you got it all wrong, you got it all wrong)
Now I got me a new look, rockin' shades'cause I'm worth it
Yeah my future's so bright, let it go (I got it like that, I got it like that)
Then you went and messed it all up
Guess what, I'm done, now go get your stuff now
Now you wishin' I was the one
Too bad, so sad'cause I'm movin' on
And now that we're done, I'll be lookin' up
Got my sunglasses on
Got my sunglasses on
Days looking brighter since I've been so gone
Got my sunglasses on
Got my sunglasses on
Sunglasses on
Sunglasses on
Everything is brighter
The way it's supposed to be
Feeling so, so good
Good about things
Now everything is brighter
The way it's supposed to be
Feeling so, so good
Yeah, so, so good
Got my sunglasses on, got my sunglasses on
And now that we're done I'll be looking up
Got my sunglasses on, got my sunglasses on
Days looking brighter since I've been so gone
Got my sunglasses on, got my sunglasses on
I'll be looking up
Got my sunglasses on
Got my sunglasses on
Days looking brighter since I've been so gone
Got my sunglasses on
Got my sunglasses on
