Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-pa
I heart you
It's hot like cherry pie in the morning
Make me laugh never ever boring
Just be real'cause your smile's fake
And it will lead to your heart break
You're into me and I'm into you
But don't get cocky or you'll be the fool
Too cool for school don't be a toad
I want you like I'm thirteen
I'm gonna make a scene
Hearts
You, you, you, I heart, heart, heart you
I heart you, heart, heart, heart
You, you, you, I heart, heart heart you
I heart you
It's so, it's so, baby (badabadababa)
Heart-to-mochi on my daily (badabadababa)
I heart you (I heart you)
It's not like things were back in the day
And don't get it twisted if I call you my bae
Love me, hate me, I'll drive you crazy
I'm that boss chick, baby
I like this and you like that
Treat me like a queen or I'll talk fact
Not smack, get on track
it's time for a comeback
Heart, heart, heart, heart
You, you, you, I heart
Heart, heart, you, I heart you
Heart, heart, heart
You, you, you, I heart, heart, heart you
I heart you
XOXO baby
Hearts emoji on the daily
Heart you, I heart you
XOXO baby
You got my heart and I want you on the daily
XOXO kissy face
I want you right now I love the chase
I heart you (let's do this)
I heart you (you, you, you)
I heart you (I heart you)
I heart you (you, you, you)
I heart you (I heart you)
XOXO baby, heart's emoji on the daily, I heart you, I heart you
