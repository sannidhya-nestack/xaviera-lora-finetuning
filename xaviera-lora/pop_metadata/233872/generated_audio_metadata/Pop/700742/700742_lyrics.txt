You must think I'm broken now
all the things we spoke about
The fact that we did is not your way out
You must suck'bout how I feel
And what it means when I sigh
What truth be told, I'm doing alright
And if I don't, I'll never let you see
What it does to me, and how it feels to me
I keep my feet right on the ground
You shut me down
I'm shut down let's reboot now
I think I'm ready cause I'm feeling real good now
I got stuff to do school and everything
I hope I don't crash or anything
You must think it's over now
That everything's so sorted out
If that's what you think
Then knock yourself out
If I wanna tell you how I feel
Only these words can come out of me
And if I don't, I'll never let you see
What it does to me and how it feels to me
I keep my feet right on the ground
You struck me down
And if I don't, I'll never let you see
What it does to me and how it feels to me
I keep my feet right on the ground
You shut me down
I'm shut down let's reboot now
I think I'm ready cause I'm feeling real good now
I got stuff to do school and everything
I hope I don't crash or anything
