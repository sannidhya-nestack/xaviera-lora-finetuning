I was scared that night in the bitter cold
Walking on the street others searching high and low
Nothing to lose kept running to the light
I was hungry and lost that night
I went to make it through all the silent days
Tired and bored of those men and their foolish ways
I dreamt of your touch, that reached into my soul
I was locked in a world, really alone
But when you took my hand
On that screaming night
You came and rescued me
And I fell to life
Oh, brought me back to life
Oh, that night
I was down and out but you took me back home
I recognize that place, it's the place I've been before
Now you found the key that stops this crazy mind
You gave me hope all that night
The night
