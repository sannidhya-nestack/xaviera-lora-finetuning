Who can I adore? I'm not really sure
How to find that perfect girl I've never met before
If you wake up one day, walk right by my place
Will I look out the window in time to see your face
Is it magic or am I tragic?
How am I supposed to see if you're meant for me?
Am I lonely or you my only?
When I find you I believe there's some magic left for me
This lady on my mind
Sweet as she is fine
Caught up in the mystery of my future valentine
If you'll come from the stars
And show me who you are
We'll match the puzzle pieces
And we'll solve it with our hearts
Is it magic
Or am I tragic
How am I supposed to see if you're meant for me
Am I lonely or are you my only
When I find you I believe there's some magic left for me
Tired of tossing, turning out the lights
Alone at night
But that's alright, yeah that's alright
Is it magic or am I tragic
How am I supposed to see if you're meant for me
Am I lonely
Are you my only?
When I find you I believe
There's some magic left
Is it magic? (Is it magic?)
Or am I tragic? (Or am I tragic?)
How am I supposed to see
If you're meant for me?
Am I lonely? (Am I lonely?)
Are you my only? (Are you my)
When I find you I believe there's some magic left for me
