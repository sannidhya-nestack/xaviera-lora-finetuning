Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I saw you walking by around 3pm
At the height of Ashbury Street
Was the beginning of spring and I was wondering
Why my heart just skipped a beat
My head starts trembling
My feet couldn't move
And I was losing my cool
My legs start shaking
My eyes were glued
And all that because of you
You set me on fire
Feels like the sun's burning down on me
You can take me higher
If I only met your feet
You're shining down on my skin
As weak as it feels like the metal of doom
You set me on fire like no one else could do
It's not the first time I've seen you before
But I'm shyer than I seem
And every time I try to make a move
It's so much harder than I've foreseen
My hands start trembling
My feet cannot move
And I am losing my cool
My legs start shaking
My eyes are glued
And all that because of you
You set me on fire
Feels like the sun's burning down on me
You can take me higher
If I'm falling at your feet
You're shining down on my skin
A sweet sin feels like the middle of June
You set me on fire
That no one else could do
Got my eyes wide open
My heart could be broken
But I'm reaching out to you
Feels like it's choking
no one has spoken
But I'm reaching out to you
Feels like the sun's burning down on me
You can take me higher
If I'm falling at your feet
You're setting me on fire
Feels like the sun's burning down on me
You can take me higher
If I'm falling at your feet
You're shining down on my skin, a sweet scent, feels like the middle of June (ooh)
You were setting me on fire, like no one else could do (ooh)
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
