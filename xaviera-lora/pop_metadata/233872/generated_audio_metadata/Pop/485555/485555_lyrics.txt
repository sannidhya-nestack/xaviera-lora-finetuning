I can only wait so long
I can only run so far
I can hide these open wounds
But not the scars
Love can make the heart and soul
Turn into a raging storm
I can play the silent fool
For you know I
Oh, my love, love has abandoned me
And my heart knows which way is home
But when I knock on your door
You say love doesn't live here anymore
Oh my love
I was in a blinding snow
You were on the other side
Acting like you had control
Of my life
You promised me that things would change
Maybe you'd say anything
To avoid the pain that soon the truth would bring
Oh my love, love has grown cold as the Baltic Sea
And my heart, it's drifting away from me
I can't keep going on
If love doesn't live here anymore
If there was something that you needed more
I'd have given anything
But after all the things I've seen
I'm not so sure
That I was just a candlelight
Burning in your empty rooms
Love was like an orphan ghost
Passing through home
Oh my love, love has abandoned me
And my heart, it knows which way is home
But when I knock on your door
You say love doesn't live here anymore
Oh my love, love
I have outlived your destiny
Oh my love, won't you repay your debt to me
Before you leave here with everything
My love, why won't you leave me
Rainbow
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
My love
