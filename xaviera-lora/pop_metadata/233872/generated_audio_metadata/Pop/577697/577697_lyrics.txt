Honesty
In my heart of hearts
Is all I want
It's all I need
Honesty
Oh, tenderness
In the eyes of love
We'll bridge the falls
And so it's sea
Tenderness
Let's start again without worry
Give our differences to something bigger
If we can do that it's another life
Another life for us
Load up the car, dogs included
There's a lot of road we've gotta cover
With every mile there's another chance
Another chance for us, oh
All of this comes down to trust
All the way I believe in us
All the way I believe in us
All the way
Let's start again without worry
Give our differences to something bigger
If we can do that it's another life, another life for us
Load up the car, dogs included
There's a lot of road we've gotta cover
With every mile there's another chance
Another chance for us, oh, oh, oh
