I wanna know you
Wanna feel how fast my heart would beat
If you were close to me
I wanna show you
Wanna let you loose inside my brain
To see if you'd run or stay
I can't seem to look away
I'm hypnotized by you
I'm hanging on to what you say
I'm hypnotized by you
No one on this world that I'd rather spend this day with, it's you
Loving you is so easy
Loving you is so easy
I can't seem to look away
I'm hit no times by you
I'm hanging on the words you say
I'm hypnotized by you
Oh
