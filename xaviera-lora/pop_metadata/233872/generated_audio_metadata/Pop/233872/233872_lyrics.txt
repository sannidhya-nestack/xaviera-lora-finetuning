Now I start to get proud of me
I've got the eyes to see you
Firelight in my heart
Is the right way to do
I start dancing to the rhythm
Dancing to the rhythm
I stop dancing to the rhythm
To the rhythm of love
I'm sitting on a piece of wood
Somewhere in the jungle
I'm alone, only me
Somewhere in the jungle
And I'm wishing you were next to me
Somewhere in the jungle
And everything would change in a minute
I start dancing to the rhythm
Dancing to the rhythm, I start
Dancing to the rhythm, the rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
(Don't tell me you're leaving me)
(Don't tell me you're leaving me)
Dance to the rhythm
Dance to the rhythm
The rhythm of love
Dance to the rhythm
The rhythm of love
