I awoke and opened my eyes
And saw a man I couldn't recognize
I said who are you and how did we get here
I think we gotta go but I don't know where
Everything is dark and cold now
You're all alone, how will you navigate?
And even though I kinda saw a light in the distance
I turned and listened to what he had to say
He said, "Come follow me"
I'll take you away and show you a place that you've only dreamed of
Follow my lead, you'll never be alone
And soon you'll et everything about this place you once called home
You once called home, home
So I left and ignored what he said
Until I found that I was lost again
Felt like I walked in a circle
there was that guy
As if he'd been waiting the whole time
Everything is dark and cold now
And I just don't know how to navigate
And even though I kinda saw a light in the distance
I had to listen and go his way
He said, "Come follow me, I'll take you away
And show you a place that you've only dreamed of
Follow my lead"
You'll never be alone
And soon you'll et everything about this place you once called home
You once called home, home, home
Come home, come home, you once called home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home
Come follow me, I'll take you away, and show you a place that you only dreamed of
Follow my lead, you'll never be alone, and soon you'll et everything about this place you once called home
