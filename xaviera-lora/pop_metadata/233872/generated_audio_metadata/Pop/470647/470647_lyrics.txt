I was wrong to say
I wouldn't change a thing'cause
In the story of our lives
The best of times through color glass
And if you should call
It's no trouble, no trouble at all
I'll paint out the sun
Back where we begun again
Put it on the right track, get it right back
The message from my heart is too loud to stay apart
So put it on the right track, steal it right back
It's high time now
Time moves on, enough to let me move on past, but
Every little now and then, it creeps on back to shade my smile
I'm here once again
And I'm dealing, I'm feeling the pain
So who takes the fall that covers it all again?
Put it on the right track, get it right back
The message from my heart is too loud to stay apart
So put it on the right track, steal it right back
It's high time now
