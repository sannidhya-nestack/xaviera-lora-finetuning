I know this love is for real
I know this love is for real
I know this love is for real
Can't stop this feeling of insecurity
And I need to be close wherever you will be
Cause living has no meaning has no aim
When love cannot be found
Nothing really matters when you are not around
Like a town without a sound
Can you feel it? I'm your man
Can you feel it? I'm your man
Can you feel it? I'm your man
Can you feel it? I'm your man
Can you feel it? I'm your man
Can you feel it? I'm your man
Touch the sky (yes we can)
Can you reach the sky (yes we can)
Can you touch the sky (yes we can)
Can you reach the sky just you and I
Can you touch the sky (yes we can)
Can you reach the sky (oh yes we can)
Can you touch the sky (yes we can)
The only thing you gotta know is I'm your man
I know this love is for real
I want this love is for real
I know this love is for real
Apologizing softly for whispering your name, oh yeah
Love can be fun but for sure it's not a game, oh no
And all we need is purpose and a reason for what it's all about
But does it even matter when you are not around
Like a time without a sound
I know this love is for real
I hope this love is for real
I know this love is for real
Can you feel it? I'm your man
Can you feel it? I'm your man
Can you feel it? I'm your man
Can you feel it? I'm your man
Can you feel it? I'm your man
Can you feel it? I'm your man
