I like the way you talk to me with your eyes
I like the way you sing to me with your smile
You fit right into the spaces of my thoughts
You fit right into the beats of my heart
You lock me on your ground now
Since you swept me right off my feet
You carry me on your soul now
Since you swept me right off my feet
You sway me round your life
Since you swept me right off my feet
You dance me to the beats of your tunes
Since you swept me right off my feet
I like the way you know what's going on with me
I like the way you hold my faith when I'm so not me
You fit right into the spaces of my thoughts
You fit right into the beats of my heart
You walk me on your ground now
Since you swept me right off my feet
You carry me on your soul now
Since you swept me right off my feet
You sway me round your life
Since you swept me right off my feet
You dance me to the beats of your tunes
Since you swept me right off my feet
You walk me on your ground now
Since you swept me right at my feet
You carry me on your soul now
Since you swept me right at my feet
You sway me round your lap
Since you swept me right at my feet
You dance me to the beats of your tunes
Since you swept me right at my feet
