You know you can't have me
But I see your gaze
You touch me with your eyes
In so many ways
I try to approach you
But you vanish yet again
Don't keep doing this to me
You're the shadow on the wall
You keep haunting my dreams
I can't take much more
Everything is not what it seems
Will you just disappear?
Or just walk through the door?
Ooh
Goodbye phantom
You go places where you know I will be
It's tormenting just to see that you're looking at me
I try to approach you, but you vanish yet again
Don't keep doing this to me
You're the shadow on the wall
You keep haunting my dreams
I can't take much or more
Everything is not what it seems
Will you just disappear?
Or just walk through the door?
Your presence is all around
You're all I can see
Oh, I can't sleep
It's tearing me up inside
But I won't burn down
No, I won't be drowned
I won't fall
No, I won't fall
You're the shadow of my heart (No, I won't fall)
You keep haunting my dreams (I won't fall, no)
I can't take much more
Everything is not what it seems (Will you just leave me?)
Will you just answer me? (Will you leave me?)
Or just walk away? (Just leave me alone)
Goodbye phantom
