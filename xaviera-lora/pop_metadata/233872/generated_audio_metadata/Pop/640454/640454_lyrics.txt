So you can smile like summer
You can dream things brighter so far
Just harder, I can't recall how it all got started
I won't deny, mistakes I made
Regrets and lies, it's just love and hate
It's still not too late, we can hide
Hold on to what's gone, it can't go on
Just don't be afraid'cause baby it's still not too late
Say goodbye, come closer
Think of all things better
Don't cry, stay stronger
But can we love each other baby no longer?
I won't deny mistakes I made
Regrets and lies
It's just love and hate, it's still not too late
We can't hide, hold on to what's gone
It can't go on, just don't be afraid
baby it's still not too late
I won't deny
Mistakes I made
Regrets and lies
It's just love and hate
It's still not too late
We can't hide
Hold on to what's gone
It can't go on
Just don't be afraid,'cause baby it's still not too late
