If you're gonna be a dirty flirt just know you run the risk of going down
There is nothing wrong with a little hurt if you are willing to be found
More or less you won't want me to stop
Less is more but not when I'm on top
Dancing on the edge when you try to take control
Don't back me in the corner cause I'll push when you pull
You're walking on the ledge when you try to make me lose it
Better give what you take better know how to use it
Dancing on the edge (dancing on the edge)
Dancing on the edge (dancing on the edge)
Dancing on the edge (dancing on the edge)
Dancing on the edge (dancing on the edge)
If you're gonna play the pretty victim
You should know that I might take the bait
Don't you even think for a minute that I'm caught
you will lose this game
More or less you won't want me to stop
Less is more but not when I'm on top
Yeah yeah yeah
Dancing on the edge when you try to take control
Don't back me in the corner cause I'll push when you pull
You're walking on the ledge when you try to make me lose it
Better give what you take better know how to use it
Dancing on the edge (dancing on the edge)
Dancing on the edge (dancing on the edge
Dancing on the edge
Dancing on the edge, dancing on the edge, dancing on the edge
You gonna send me over if you keep it up
Don't say I didn't warn you when I come bust, yeah
You gonna send me over if you keep it up
Don't say I didn't warn you when I come bust
Dancing on the edge when you try to take control
Don't back me in the corner cause I'll push when you pull
You're walking on the ledge when you try to make me lose it
Better give what you take better know how to use it
Dancing on the edge when you try to take control
Don't back me in the corner cause I'll push when you pull
You're walking on the ledge when you try to make me lose it
Better give what you take better know how to use it
Dancing on the edge, yeah yeah
