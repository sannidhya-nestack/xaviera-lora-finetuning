She's going into the house
I wish I was small in my sense
I wish that I made very soft angel eyes
I wish I was small in my sins
I wish that I had very large angel eyes
Ten forty five
Ten forty five
I wish I could stay the hands of fear
I wish that I could calm the beast inside my head
I wish I could allay the hands of fear
I wish that I could stop the color of this red
I want the morning sun up between my toes
Dancing in a yellow velvet robe
1045, you're still alive
1045, I can still cry
I wish I was small in my sins
Wish I was small in my sins
Wish that I made very soft angel sighs
Wish I was small in my sins
Wish that I had very large
Angel eyes, I want the morning sun up between my toes
Ten forty five
Dancing in a yellow velvet robe
Ten forty five, you're still mine
1045, I can still cry
