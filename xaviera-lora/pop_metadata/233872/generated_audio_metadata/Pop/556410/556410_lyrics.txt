Some days everything's a mess
There's so much clutter in my head
Some days I can't stand the race
I get so tired of feeling this way
Sometimes I wanna stay in bed
Or just get away instead
There's nothing in the world that I wouldn't give
To be free of that life and just live
For a beautiful sunrise that dries my tears
And the smell of coffee in the air
Starts singing a tune and I don't care who hears
Like a day at the beach splashing in the waves
The way I feel when I see your face
It's the little things that get me through some days
Some days, oh
Some days I just scream as I watch life slip by aimlessly
Some days are clouded by the rain and I wish for a sunny day
Sometimes I smile instead of frown, try not to let it bring me down
There's nothing in the world that I wouldn't give
To let it all go
So I can live
For a beautiful sunrise that dries my tears
And the smell of coffee in the air
I start singing a tune and I don't care who hears
Like a day at the beach splashing in the waves
The way I feel when I see your face
it's the little things that get me through some days
When you feel like you can't go on
Sing along to your favorite song
Live every day like it's your last
We're all going way too fast
Be in the moment and live for today
Each minute has something to say
So dance to music when you're alone
Laugh at all the silly jokes
Spend time with friends who help you find your way
It's the little things that get you through those days
Like the beautiful sunrise that dries my tears
And the smell of coffee in the air starts singing a tune
And I don't care who hears
Like a day at the beach when there's no rain
The way I feel when I hear your name
it's the little things that get me through some days
It's the little things that get me through some days, some days
It's the little things that get you through
It's the little things that get you through
It's the little things that get you through some days
