I took the pain, I took the night
I wrote a letter to the light
But to hear the stone to hear the pretty bells ring
Tell you're buried in the rubble alive
Tell you're buried in the rubble alive
It's a beautiful night tonight
Standing on a mountain of bones (na-na-na-na-na-na)
It's a beautiful night tonight
And now here come the rebels
Marching with their poisoned door
She took a plane, she took the night
She wrote a letter to the light
There's water in the well in the mouth of the brave
The hand of God will land upon the sound of the rain
It's a beautiful night tonight
Standing on a mountain of bones
It's a beautiful night tonight
And now here come the rebels
Marching with their boys to war
Walking in the Badlands, a river of blood
Dreaming of a holy land with heaven above
Walking in the Badlands, a river of blood
Dreaming of a holy land with heaven above
Walking in the Badlands, a river of blood
Dreaming of a holy land with heaven above
I took the pain, I took the night
I came to sing and I came to fight
Walking in the badlands, riding the drums and walking on the badlands, riding the drums and walking on the badlands, riding the drums and walking on the Badlands, it's a beautiful night tonight
Walking in the badlands, riding the drums and walking on the badlands, riding the drums and walking on the badlands, riding the drums and walking on the Badlands, it's a beautiful night tonight
