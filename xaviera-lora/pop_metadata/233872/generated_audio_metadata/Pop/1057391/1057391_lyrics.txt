We have each other's backs
Take anyone to task that tells me
That you are my one and only
You see, you've been there for me
And I'll be there for you
Every day here on earth
I will love
I will love you
I will love you'til the end of time
Oh I will
I will love
I will love you
Every day
Cause I will love you till the end of time
Now every day
And every night
I spend so much time
Thinking about you all the time
Once in the morning
Twice in the afternoon
Three times in the evening
Overall I think of you, you, you, you, you
Cause I will love, cause I will love, cause I will love you
'Cause I will love you'til the end of time (time, time, time, time, time, time, time)
Oh, I will (I will)
I will love (love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
I will love you every day
I will love you'til the end of time (time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time)
Say it again now
I will love (love, love, love, love, love, love)
'Cause I will love you
I will love you'til the end of time
You know I will
I will love
'Cause I will love you,'cause I will love you
I will love you'til the end of time
Brighter days,'cause I will love you
Better ways,'cause I will love you
To show how I feel
I will love you about you
I will love you
Every day is better
I will love you
Every night much better
I will love you
Don't take nothing for granted
I will love you
You take my breath away baby
'Cause I will love
I will love you
I will love you'til the end of time
I, I, I, I say it again now
I will love
I will love you
'Cause I will love you'til the end of time
