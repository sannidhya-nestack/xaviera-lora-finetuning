Day and night
Black and white
I'm the wind
I'm the moonlight
Oh, oceans won't
Won't sink my boat
I make the waves
I make the world float
Oh, oh, oh, oh no
Windows closing, closing, no control
Pushing on my throat, I thought I was small
Something ain't right, something ain't right
I should be stronger than all of this
Danger, danger, nothing stops me, nothing stops me
I can't explain away these tears
Breaking, breaking, no one told me, no one told me
Watch the cloud, it's darker now
And when it rains, can't stop the shower
But I push on through
It's what I do
So drunk on the love, drunk on the power
Hey, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no
Windows closing, closing, no control
Closing on my throat, I thought I was small
Something ain't right, something ain't right
I should be stronger than all of this
Danger, danger, nothing stops me, nothing stops me
Why can't I see the changes in front of me
Understand
Don't understand
This ain't the plan
This ain't the plan
No it's no longer in my hands
No
No
No I'm
Stronger than all of this
No fear
Danger
Danger
Nothing stops me
Nothing stops me
I can't explain away these tears
Breaking, breaking, no one told me, no one told me
Stronger than all of this, no fear
Danger, danger, nothing stops me, nothing stops me
I can't explain away
