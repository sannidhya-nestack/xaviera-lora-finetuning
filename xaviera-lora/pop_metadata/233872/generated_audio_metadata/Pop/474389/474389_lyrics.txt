You wanna use your weight at the top
Because a pretty face is what you got
You wanna drive all the fast cars
Hang out with the all stars
But baby tell me when will it stop?
She's right in front of you but you can't see
She gonna use you like she did to me
So let me give you a couple words of advice
Just run, run, run, run'cause she ain't nice
You wanna use your weight at the top (here she go)
Because a pretty face is what you got (here she go)
You wanna drive all the fast cars, hang out with the opps
Shifting gears (Baby tell me when will it stop)
Oh no
Oh yeah she wants you but just how long is that gonna last?
She wants to spend times with you but you ain't got that cash
She gone, she gone, she gone now
She gone, she gone, she gone now
When will you wake up and get a clue?
She gonna leave you feeling down and blue (oh-oh-oh)
And when your credit and your cash is gone
She got another man that she'll put on
You wanna use your way to the top (here she comes)
Because her pretty face is what you got (there she goes)
You wanna drive all the fast cars
Hang out with the all stars (shift and give)
Baby, tell me when will it stop?
Oh yeah she wants you but just how long is that gonna last?
She wants to spend time with you but you ain't got that cash
She gone, she gone, she gone now
She gone, she gone, she gone now
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
She gone
Oh yeah she wants you
But just how long is that gonna last?
She wants to spend times with you
But you ain't got that cash
She gone, she gone, she gone now
She gone, she gone, she gone now
You wanna use your weight
She gone to the top
Use your weight
She gone top
You wanna use your weight
She gone to the top
Use your weight
She gone top
