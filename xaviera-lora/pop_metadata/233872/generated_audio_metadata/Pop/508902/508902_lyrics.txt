This is the ending no one thinks about
I hope this letter lets me sort it out
While there's still time
I might be gone but you're still here
Blue eyes, gold hair and no fear
Don't let the fire burn out in your heart
Now you go girl, you go girl
Live long and marry right
May you be strong
Move on in love with all your might
And I owe you, I owe you
For every smile, every tear, every moment you were near
Love again but please don't take his hand
And watch the sunset on Oak Island
Everyone said they'll keep an eye on you
Whether or not you really want them to
They've got your back
Mmmmmm
Remember long drives to the beach in the winter time
Love as pure as the Carolina sunshine
Wrapping my arms around you
We sat on the sand (Feel the weight of the world tonight)
My heart will give up before long
I know you'll struggle to hold on
Darkness will give way to a new dawn
Now you go girl, you go girl
Live long and marry right
May you be strong
Move on in love with all your might
And I owe you, I owe you
For every smile, every tear
Every moment you were near
Love again but please don't take his hand
And watch the sunset on Oak Island
Take this letter once you've read it and light a match
You'll be running blind if you're always looking back
Take this letter once you've read it and light a match
And go girl, just go girl
Live long and marry right
May you be strong
Move on and live a brilliant life
And I owe you, I owe you
For every smile, every tear, every whisper in my ear
Love again but please don't take his hand
And watch the sunset on Oak Island
Watch the sunset on Oak Island
