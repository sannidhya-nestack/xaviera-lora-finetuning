Dream your dreams tonight, let the colors fly
Hang on to your love until morning light
Live your fantasy, your very own
Vision to ignite this new breaking dawn
Racing through your soul, through galaxy
A miracle of thoughts and discovery
Lift your heart and mind and watch it grow
Here you can achieve the unachievable
All you need, illumination
All you need, elevation
All you need, destination
All you need, celebration
All you need is imagination
All you need is a man
Dream your dreams tonight, let the colors fly
Hang on to your love, want your morning alive
Live your fantasy, your very own
A vision to ignite, there's no breaking down
Racing through your soul's big galaxy
A miracle of science and discovery
Lift your heart and mind and watch it grow
Here you can achieve the unachievable
Racing through your soul, sweet galaxy
A miracle of class and discovery
Take your heart and mind and watch it grow
Here you can achieve the unachievable
All you need is imagination
All you need is imagination
Dream your dream tonight, let the colors fly
Hang on to your love until morning light
Live your fantasy, your very own
A vision to ignite this new breaking dawn
Racing through your soul, sweet galaxy
A miracle of smiles and discovery
If your heart and mind don't watch it grow
Here you can achieve the unachievable
