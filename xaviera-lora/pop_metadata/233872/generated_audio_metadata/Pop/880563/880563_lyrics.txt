Now we're sitting on the edge of the moon
Fishing for stars
Dangling our feet in the clouds, yeah
Skipping stones from a year to Mars
Moving at the speed of love
Space cadets maroon
Fishing for stars on the edge of the moon
Oh skinny dipping out in the Milky Way
Gravity done left town
Oh and Bill Henley in the comments said that
The best damn man in Neptune town
And when we kiss up here
Forever lasts all afternoon
Fishing for stars along the edge of the moon
When I traverse the universe to blast off with you
You're my intergalactical heart again
I keep my hands off of your celestial body
An Aurora, Borealis, dancing in your eyes
I'm on about all the things about Saturn, yeah
The planets are gonna align tonight
Here in Cincinnati in the CD Motown room
Fishin' for the stars, yeah, out on the edge of the moon
Fishin' for the stars, out on the edge of the moon
Oh, we're goin' fishin', yeah, oh yeah
(howling)
