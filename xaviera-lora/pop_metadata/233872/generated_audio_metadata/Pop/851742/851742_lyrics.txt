Fierce and night and the moon is full
The wolf howls from the cliff top shores
Wind is silent, bitter still
Grass is cold with icy claws
And the mist, the mist draws in
Ancient times are beating strong
Nature's blood like ocean waves
Souls not lost or half passed on
Footprints in the sand repaving the mist
The mist rolls in
Powerful mist, you are clouded in mystery
Dancing in swirls, you are hiding identity
Blackened worlds like the cloak of the angels
Take me away to the land where the mists are from
Where the mists are from
There's a night and the moon is full
The love falls from the clifftop shores
Wind is silent, bitter still
Grass is cold with icy claws
And the mist, and mist draws in
Ancient times are beating strong
Nature's blood like ocean waves
Sons not lost though have passed on
Footprints in the sand we paint in the mist
The mist draws in
Powerful mist, you are clouded in mystery
Dancing in swirls, you are hiding identity
Bucket worlds like the cloak of the angels
Take me away to the land where the mists are grown
Where the mists are grown
Powerful mist, you are clouded in mystery
Dancing in swirls, you are hiding identity
Blackened worlds like the cloak of the angels
Take me away to the land where the mists are long
Where the mists are long
