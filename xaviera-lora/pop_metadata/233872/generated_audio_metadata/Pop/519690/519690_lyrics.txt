Now she combs her hair
Got her homework
Painting up her nails just red pink with blue red
And she's on her phone
With her boyfriend
Says he'll always love her and they're forever
Thirteen seemed like such a good dream
Time must fly can't even count the days
Times change people go their own ways
Life moves on no matter what they say
Maybe you'll see me
Maybe I'll walk by and maybe you'll meet me
We'll party all night won't that be nice
Maybe you'll love me
Maybe I'll hold you tight but maybe you'll hate me
Looking to fight, so wrong but I could be right
Maybe I'll walk by and maybe you'll meet me
We'll party all night, won't that be nice
Maybe you'll love me
Maybe I'll hold you tight but maybe you'll hate me
Looking to fight, so wrong but I could be right
Now he's in his car, got the roof down
And it's off to college now, California
And he's on his phone (on his phone) with his girlfriend (with his girlfriend)
And she says she'll wait for him, know what I mean?
Eighteen, that would be the best teen
Just can't wait, my minutes seem like days
Times change people go their own ways
Life moves on no matter what they say
Maybe you'll see me
Maybe I'll walk by and maybe you'll meet me
We'll party all night won't that be nice
Maybe you'll love me
Maybe I'll hold you tight but maybe you'll hate me
Looking to fight, so wrong but I could be right
Maybe I'll walk by and maybe you'll meet me
We'll party all night, won't that be nice
Maybe you'll love me
Maybe I'll hold you tight but maybe you'll hate me
Looking to fight, so wrong but I could be right
