Who is it, who is it in?
Why did you do it in?
What is there to it in?
Maybe I blew it in
Who is it, who is it in?
Why did you do it in?
Maybe I blew it in
What is there to it in?
Thousands of people all around, they've summoned me
I'll have no memories, I won't know who you'll be
Standing still, I feel the beats they're living to
Not just their hearts and moods, they've got their eyes on you
Who is it? Who is it? And why did you do it? And what is there to it? And maybe I blew it
Who is it? Who is it? And why did you do it? And maybe I blew it
What is there to it? And who is it? Who is it? And why did you do it? And what is there to it? And maybe I blew it
Who is it, who is it in their eyes? (Who is it, who is it in their eyes?)
You it, maybe I'm the one (Who is it, who is it in their eyes?)
They've got their eyes on you (Who is it, who is it in their eyes?)
They've got their eyes on you
