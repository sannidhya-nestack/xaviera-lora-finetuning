It's so easy to, it's so easy to love you, mmm
That's why I'll say it again, it's so easy
You're so simply delightful, just irresistible and
Each day is covered in rainbows of surprise
You woo me with the way you always satisfy
Let's keep it rolling, let's keep it going now
Let's keep it rolling, keep the love flowing out
We couldn't be fresher, together we win hands down
