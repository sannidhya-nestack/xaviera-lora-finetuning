Just hold on
And outside it's stormy and there's no end in sight
And inside your silence as you switch out the light
I watch your face while you are asleep
A resting grace I want to keep
I'll light the way so you can see
The road ahead so nearly free
Just hold on to this time
You'll be fine I promise everyday
Just hold on I'll take care of you
Just hold on (just hold on) to this time
We'll be fine, I promise, everyday
Just hold on (just hold on) I'll take care of you
And this time, I feel it, you need the strength to fight
And sunshine, will cut through and fade the darkest night
I watch your face while you are asleep
A resting grace I want to keep
I'll light the way so you can see
The road ahead so nearly free
Just hold on to this time
You'll be fine I promise everyday
Just hold on I'll take care of you
Just hold on (just hold on)
To this time
You'll be fine, I promise
Every day
Just hold on (just hold on)
I'll take care of you
Just hold on
Just hold on
Just hold on
Just hold on
Just hold on to this time
You'll be fine I promise everyday
Just hold on I'll take care of you
Just hold on to this time
You'll be fine, I promise, every day
Just hold on, I'll take care of you
Just hold on
