The rain drops on my window
Can't stop grow or be low
Life just moves so slow
When we grow
Sun hides behind the grey
Storms come but they don't stay
Hold tight and find your way
Day by day
Rain's never in vain, washing off the pain
We can start again together
Feel the thunder roll, let it stir your soul
Every heart's a bone, make it whole
Dancing in the puddles
Lost in my life's muddles
Bursting all the bubbles
No more troubles
Rain's never in vain
Washing off the pain
We can start again together
Feel the thunder roll
Let it stir your soul
Every heart's a goal
Make it whole
Dancing in the puddles
Lost in all our smuddles
Bursting all the bubbles
No more troubles
Rain's never in vain
Washing off the pain
We can start again together
Rain drops on my window
Can't stop the world below
Life just moves so slow
But we grow
