I've been looking at you and hoping that you would look my way
I've been telephoning not knowing quite what to say
Go to put my heart on the line
Never know that we were two of a kind
And when I fell for you
That you would fall for me too
I've fallen for you
And all the little things you do
I'm tingling through and through
And every thought of you
I wanna show you everyday
Just how it says come true
I'm falling for you
Now that we're together forever
You gotta know it's true
That nothing whatsoever could ever
Take me away from you
You and I
It is amazing how things can change within a blink of an eye
When you told me that you were hoping
And when you fell for me
That I would fall for you too
I'm falling for you
And all the little things you do
I'm tingling through and through
And every thought of you
I wanna show you everyday
Just how this has come true
I'm falling for you
Falling, falling for you
Falling for
Falling, falling for you
Fall
Falling, falling for you
Falling for you
Falling, falling for you
When I fell for you
You fell for me too
I've fallen for you
And all the little things you do
I'm tinglin' through and through
At every thought of you
I wanna show you everyday
Just how this has come true
I'm fallin', I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you
