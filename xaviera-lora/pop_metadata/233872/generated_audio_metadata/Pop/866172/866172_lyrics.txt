Like a tidal wave
Like an earthquake
Like a tidal wave
Like an earthquake
Like a tidal wave
Like a tidal wave
Like an earthquake
Like a tidal wave
As far the west is from the east sunrise
That breaks through the cracks of a mountain's skies
So he comes with impaling light and I ask him
Do we live or do we die?
Like a dead body
Like a dead body
Like a tidal wave, like an earthquake, like a tidal wave
Like a tidal wave, like an earthquake, like a tidal wave
I've searched the colours of the western skies
Heard a teacher talk to me about some other life
But the question of my heart's desire
Is do we live or do we die?
Like a tidal wave, like an earthquake
Like a tidal wave
Like a tidal wave, like an earthquake
Like a tidal wave
Now I sleep, now I dream, now it's war, now it's peace
Now I sleep, now I dream, now it’s war, now it's peace
Like an earthquake, like a tidal wave
Like an earthquake, like a tidal wave
Like a tidal wave
Like an earthquake
Like a tidal wave
Now I sleep
Now I dream
Now it's war
Now it's peace
Now I sleep
Now I dream
Now it's war
Now it's peace
Like a tidal wave
Like a tidal wave
Like an earthquake
Like a tidal wave
