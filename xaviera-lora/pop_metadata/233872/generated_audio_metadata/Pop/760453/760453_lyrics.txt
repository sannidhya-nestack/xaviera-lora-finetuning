I wanna feel that bass drop
I'm going in, I'm about that life
When the clock hit two, I'm ready to move
And you're just my type
Give me the night and I might take two
Under the lights, I wanna see you move
Half the bar going down round two
And I got something to prove
Better hold your girl tight
When I'm on the scene and I'm lifted up
Started with a bottle and we mixed it up
Baby this is your jam and we turned it up
Tomatoes waist bumping we cutting it loose
Cracking them cans and we breaking them rules
Hell of a night that's the thing that we do
Living for one but we drinking for two (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
Uh, yeah, girl you crazy
And when I say crazy I think you're amazing
All your girlfriends bar hopping in
Shopping at Forever 21 but you were born in the 80's
Wanna come back to my place it's a castle
Actually that's all a lie
See I threw what I can to get by
So how do I spend this
My condo's kinda small but there's room for a princess
And I got friends girl you could bring like three friends
Make this after party last all weekend
Cameras teasing, sleeping eating
Take a lil nap after that repeating
Oh so fly
And if we fall in love, oh meet yo' ma
Together we could live long and love life
I don't love you yet but I love you tonight Mike Les
You know we go hard right in the scene
Falling in love then I'm breaking it clean
Breaking it clean if you know what I mean
I'm making it fun, I'm making a scene
Shorty look good, you know I might hit
Give her the night and take her off my list
Talk about a list, the kid make hits
Man I'm tryna keep ladies off of both my wrists like this
Get up
Get up, this for the girls in lot to get lit up
This is for the guys who are buying that liquor
Act like tonight you ain't throwing that shit up
Me and Chris, we don't make songs, we make hits
So this is a hit list for all of the bitches
Playing our shit when they running they business
Can I get a witness? (Witness)
