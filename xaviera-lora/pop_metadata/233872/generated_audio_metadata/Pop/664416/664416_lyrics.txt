You left graffiti on the edge of my heart
You made it easy now it's far too hard
You're turning candles into dynamite
I'm drawing shadows in the morning light
You tuned the strings inside my mind
A mental melody so hard to find
You took the colors and you turned them gold
You took my words and aligned them in bold
You turned a dead son into a man
And now it seems I'm doing all I can
this world don't feel like home
You turned a dead son into a man
And now it seems I'm doing all I can
this world don't feel like home without you
I'm turning pillows in my homemade grave
I'm shooting windows not to misbehave
I killed the king on a chopping board
I'm cutting knives'cause they feel ignored
I'm reading pages in a coffee bean
And now I'm sipping on a magazine
I'm going left on a circular saw
I'm scoring goals but I don't know the score
I'm making shapes with the memory foam
I'm placing bets on a semi-tonal baby, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You turned a dead soul into a man
And now it seems I'm doing all I can
this world don't feel like home
You turned a dead son into a man
And now it seems I'm doing all I can
this world don't feel like home without you
