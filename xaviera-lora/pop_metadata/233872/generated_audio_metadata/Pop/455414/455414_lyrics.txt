The infinite, infinite, the infinite, infinite
A million lonely people
Crossed the starting line
A million lonely people
Might never come back this time
And all around us clutching
For signs of something good
Something to believe in
Something we never could
The infinite, the infinite, the infinite, the infinite
A million angry people
Much enough to war
Yeah, a million fighting people
But they don't know what they're fighting for
Seems nobody has answers as to why we feel so small
the listeners don't listen as one by one we fall
Mmm, the infinite (the infinite) infinite (the infinite) infinite (the infinite)
We are forever now
And we're rising up together now
Yes we are forever now
Gotta make this a better way
With open mind and open heart
Take control and seize the day
A million lonely people
Cross the starting line
And a million lonely people
Never came back this time
Oh but a million lonely people
Reached way beyond the stars
Way beyond the madness
To find out just who we are
Infinite, infinite, infinite, infinite, infinite
