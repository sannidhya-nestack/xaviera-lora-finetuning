Let's go
Like a ticking bomb
Ready to explode
Need to take a chill
Let the pressure go
Like a sheet of glass
Far from shatterproof
Don't wanna see you break
Lose the attitude
Can't deny, can't deny
You're stepping closer to the heat
Can't deny, can't deny, you should be moving next to me
Hands up in the air
Come and join the party people
Feel it disappear
When you're with the party people
Watch the tension leave when the beat arrives
Emotional release, roller coaster ride
Now the party rocks, baseline hits the floor
Like a shooting star, you're brighter than before
Can't deny, can't deny you're finally moving from the edge
Can't deny, can't deny this feeling going through your head (come on)
Hands up in the air
Come and join the party people
Feel it disappear
When you're with the party people (people)
Hands up in the air (air)
Come and join the party people (hands up in the air)
Feel it disappear (oh, oh, oh)
When you're with the party people (it's alright)
It's alright, baby
Can't deny, can't deny, you're stepping closer to the heat
Can't deny, can't deny, you should be moving next to me
Hands up in the air (hands up in the air)
Come and join the party people (yeah)
Feel it disappear (ooh)
When you're with the party people
Hands up in the air
Come and join the party people
Feel it disappear
When you're with the party people
Put your hands up, up, up, up, up, yeah
Join the party and everything's all good
Up, up, up, up, yeah
Join the party and everything's all right
Hands up in the air, yeah
Put your hands up
Join the party and everything's all right
Hands up in the air, yeah
Join the party and everything's all right
