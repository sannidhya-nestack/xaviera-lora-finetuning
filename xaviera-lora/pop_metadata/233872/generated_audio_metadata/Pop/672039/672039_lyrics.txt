The sun is hot and blazing
There's no cloud inside
Guess a Monday can feel bright
It makes us look amazing
But weather cautious kind
It gets us through the night
We could be dancing in the shadow
And still be blind and so bright
The eye in the sky
'Cause we are surrounded by a halo
That keeps us mystified
Except no compromise
Like Mona Lisa owns her smile
We're painted in love
Painted in love
Like Rembrandt owns the night
We're painted in love, painted in love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're painted in love, painted in love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're painted in love, painted in love
We got what we were craving for
Didn't seek to find
What makes us feel alright
Now all we do is gaze in
Into each others eyes
Till our bodies slow collide
We could be living loud and limbo
Don't care about day and night
We'll just keep shining our lights
We're getting wise with what we don't know
We're just out of our minds
Do it, do it, it's right
That's the one of these that owns your smile
We're painted in love, we're painted in love
Like Rembrandt owns the night
We're painted in love, painted in love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're painted in love, painted in love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're painted in love, painted in love
Like Mona Lisa owns her smile
We're painted in love
We're painted in love
Like Rembrandt owns the night
We're painted in love
Painted in love
We're so painted in love
We're painted in love (painted in love)
Painted in love (painted in love)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (so painted, so painted)
We're painted in love (painted in love, painted in love)
We're so painted in love (oh oh oh oh oh)
We're painted in love (painted in love), painted in love (painted in love)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh yeah)
We're painted in love (painted in love), painted in love
