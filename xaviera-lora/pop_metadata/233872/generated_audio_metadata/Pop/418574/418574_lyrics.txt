I know you wish me well, you took all my remembrance
Remainder of nonsensical relation
I know your promises were copied
From best seller romance
And its poor consolation
And I
Every day I buy all your favorite food
See, I'm still waiting
Over the moon you wait for me
Over the sea you'll need me no more
Lying in my arms, I'll see you
Holding my breath, I'll see you no more
You'll never be with me again
I know what all they say
I know that I'll be better
But however hard they try to understand
Why did you have to leave me?
I don't see why you can't remain with me
And I, every day I ask
Is she good looking? Are they having fun?
Over the moon you wait for me
Over the sea you need me no more
Lying in my arms I'll see you
Holding my breath I'll see you no more
You'll never be with me again
No, no, no more
No, no, no more
No, no, no more
No, no, no more
And I, every day I die
Over the moon you wait for me
Over the sea you need me
No more
Lying in my arms I'll see you
Holding my breath I'll see you no more
You'll never be with me again
