One step at a time, I'm walking the tightrope and I'm not gonna look down
Eyes straight ahead, the future's before me, just waiting to be found
I'm not sure what's before me but I must go move
Moving backwards, standing still
Is the fastest way to falling
And the sweat and blood
What an effort it's gonna take
It will all pay off
It will be worth it
At the end of the wire
One dream at a time
Exploring the unknown
Will take me to where I belong
Things as they are may be working today
But tomorrow it may be wrong
Life's too short to be settling
Take my hand
Backwards standing still is the fastest way to falling and the sweat
And blood and effort it's gonna take
It will all pay off
It will be worth it at the end of the wire
I strongly believe that anything is possible
And what I can dream I can do
This is my journey and what I will make of it
Depends on the things I let through
Moving backwards, standing still
Is the fastest way to fall in
And the sweat and blood and effort it's gonna take
It will all pay off
It'll be worth it at the end of the wire
