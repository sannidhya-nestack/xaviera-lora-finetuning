In my city on a Friday night, heading to the joint
Everything's a vibe, checking out the menu, making our picks
Papa's pizza party gonna get our fix
Got the mozzarella oozing and the crust so thin
Sizzle in the oven, the smell draws us in
Pepperoni, mushrooms and a whole lot of cheese
Papa's pizza party bring me to my knees
Tables filled with laughter, kids dancing on their chairs
Music playing loud, everybody's got no cares
Slices flying in the air, hands reaching for a pipe
Papa's pizza party, living it up all night
Slices flying in the air, hands reaching for a bite
Papa's pizza party, we're living it up all night
