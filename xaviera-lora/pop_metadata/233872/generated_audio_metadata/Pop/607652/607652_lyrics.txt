You laid your palms flat on the denim in your lap
You waved
Bleed within you
The gravity
Begins to settle in
With relief
You release
You say listen
To what's happening with me
Ten minutes of speed
Ten minutes of speed
Ten minutes of speed for me
Ten minutes of your pure release
Oh, won't you let it all out now
Oh brother, I've got a drop above
The bottle has got me good
And somewhere out there
A little baby has got my eyes
While others have died inside
Ten minutes of speed
Ten minutes of speed
Ten minutes of speed for me
Ten minutes of your pure release
Oh won't you let it all out now
Well I want you to show me
Your disgust when I take off every thread
Be my judge and my jury
I've got a secret
I e then purge it all
Breathe, I care for you
Breathe, I care for you
Breathe, I feel for you
Ten minutes of your pure release
Oh, won't you let it all out now
Oh, won't you let it all out now
