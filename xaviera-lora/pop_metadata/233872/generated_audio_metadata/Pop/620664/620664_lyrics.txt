DJ, DJ, DJ, DJ
Let's go
Like a ticking bomb ready to explode
Need to take a chill let the pressure go
Like a sheet of glass far from shattered proof
Don't wanna see you break lose the attitude
Can't deny, can't deny you're stepping closer to the heat
Can't deny, can't deny, you should be moving next to me
Hands up in the air
Come and join the party people
Really disappear
When you're with the party people
Watch the tension leave, when the beat arrives
Emotional release, roller coaster ride
Now the party rocks, baseline hits the floor
Like a shooting star, you're brighter than before
Can't deny, can't deny, you're finally moving from the edge
Can't deny, can't deny, this feeling going through your head
Hands up in the air
Come and join the party people
Feel it disappear
When you're with the party people (people)
Hands up in the air
Come and join the party people (hands up in the air)
Feel it disappear
When you're with the party people, it's alright, it's alright baby
You know what?
Move that body, we like to party
All over the world, we leave no club tidy
Chicken in a second, we the best, no doubt
Yo, we only come and turn the party out
Throw on that beat, make it pop
Make it blast, down inside
Ramp that dance floor, we don't stop
On a record in a second, cause we on top
Johnny Nelson in the building but without his rag
Standing on the dance floor with a dread deck
I'm a party animal, yeah, luminous set
You ain't heard of me, you better get used to it
Get down, baguette bag
Come on, shake off that folks coat, life is too short, don't
Get caught up in the heat, said she said that hot dog heat (come on)
Hands up in the air (hands up in the air)
Come and join the party people (yeah)
Feel it disappear (ooh)
When you're with the party people
Hands up in the air
Come and join the party people
Feel it disappear
When you're with the party people
Put your hands up, up, up, up, up, yeah
Join the party and everything's rolling
Hands up, up, up, up, yeah
Join the party and everything's all right
Hands up in the air, yeah
Put your hands up
Join the party and everything's all right
Hands up in the air, yeah
Join the party and everything's all right
