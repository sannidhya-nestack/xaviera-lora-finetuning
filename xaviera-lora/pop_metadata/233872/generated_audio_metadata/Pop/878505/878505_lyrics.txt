Searching through my memories
Trying to find the lost ingredient
That made us such a good recipe
And what would it take to cook up a good time specialty
Made with that tender love and care
That used to be oh so sweet
Two teaspoons of gladness
One quarter cup of sadness
One sprinkle of magic
It's oh so hard to find
I'm stirring about ten cups of my passion and my kisses
And one true heart
Baby that's a pretty good start
Turn down the heat real low
I wanna cook nice and slow
Cause I believe, I still believe
We got the perfect recipe
What's it gonna take
To make you see I'm never gonna let you go
Some more of that good old fashioned T .S .C.
Wish I could be what you see in me
Two teaspoons of gladness
One quarter cup of sadness
One sprinkle of the magic
That's oh so hard to find
Stirring up our ten cups
Of my passion and my kisses
And one
Give me one, two, oh
Baby that's a pretty good start
Girl I need your recipe to guide me
I know you will survive me
But nothing works in perfect time
But you and me ain't never been a matter of time (We don't need time)
Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time (We don't need time) Time
One true heart
One true heart
I need one true heart
Please give me one true heart
Give me one true heart
Please give me one true heart
Baby that's a pretty good start
