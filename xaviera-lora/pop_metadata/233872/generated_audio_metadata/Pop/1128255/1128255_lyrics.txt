I've seen the city glow
The halls of neon magic
The motion overflow
The feeling that you hold
The power in your hand
Nothing in the world could stand the ride you're on
And then the feeling's gone
These streets are hard and cold
They have no heart or mercy
Out here the weak and old
Are pushed aside and left alone to wither away
No one hears those hungry groans at three AM
No one except them
There's no sound of children's play
Just the echo in the alleyway of the siren song
And those who don't belong
When the morning comes
The rats they start to scurry
Machines they start to hum
And businessmen they push
In a hurry on their way
Another train to catch
Still got bills to pay
Just one more city day
