Heed the warning, see the signs
Someone's sneaking up behind
Spreading rumors, telling lies
Everywhere you go tonight
So don't waste your time
Best to get on with your life
there's someone telling rumors
Everywhere you go tonight
Oh yeah, there's someone spreading rumors everywhere you go tonight
There's trouble everywhere
There's trouble everywhere
There's trouble everywhere
There's trouble everywhere
Trouble everywhere
You try to do what is right
Open doors, act polite
When does it get to it?
No one sees the light
They're always trying to fight you
Trying to slight you
Put you on defense when it makes no sense
You gotta smile and look them in the eye
Don't let'em get to you, don't let'em make you cry
You know what you know, walk away and say goodbye
There's trouble everywhere (I only try to do what's right)
There's trouble everywhere (I only try to be polite)
There's trouble everywhere (I only try to get you in the night)
There's trouble everywhere (I only try to be polite)
There's trouble everywhere (I only try to do what's right)
There's trouble everywhere (I only try to be polite)
There's trouble everywhere (I only try to get you in the night)
There's trouble everywhere (trouble everywhere)
When you seize the light
When you try to do what's right (When you try to do what's right)
When you try to do what's right
