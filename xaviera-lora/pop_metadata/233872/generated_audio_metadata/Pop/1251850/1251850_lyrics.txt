Sky so blue, so bright
We ride the waves tonight
Stars like diamonds high
Your hand in mine, we fly
Oceans gentle sway
We dance in night and day
Laugh and drift away
Wait in dreams we always play
Dream surfing with you
Under skies so new
Dream surfing all night
Everything feels right
Moonlight guides us there
Floating through the air
In this world so fair
Forever lost, no care
And the sea of dreams
Nothing's as it seems
In your eyes it gleams
We sail on golden streams
Dream surfing with you
Under skies so new
Dream surfing all night
Everything feels right
Moonlight guides us there
Floating through the air
In this world so fair
Forever lost, no care
Endless sea of dreams
Nothing's as it seems
In your eyes it gleams
We sail on golden streams
Surfing with you
Under skies so new
Dream surfing all night
Everything feels right
