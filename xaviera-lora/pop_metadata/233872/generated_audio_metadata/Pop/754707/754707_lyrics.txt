Slide down a moonbeam, hang from a star
Try to et who you are
Try to remember the child you were then
And you might be again
You took leave of your senses, you just let them go
It's like you went and left your mind behind
Chances are it still will be here when you get home
If not, I'll do my best when you come home
The luck that you gave me I never seen
Came from a place I'd never been
Wish I could go there but where would it end
And could I get back again?
Could I get back again?
You took leave of your senses, you just let them go
It's like you went and left your mind behind
Chances are it still will be here when you get home
If not, I'll do my best when you come home
This is the letter I had to write
But I'm not sure it should be sent
Take every moment you need to mend
Until you get back again
Until you get back again
Until you get back again
