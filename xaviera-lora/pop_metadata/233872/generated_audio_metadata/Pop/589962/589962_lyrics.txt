Every time I see you smile, you get stuck in my head
And every time I can't deny
There's nothing I regret
every now and then I find
You've been here all this time
And every time I can't but smile
you've been here all my life
Every time, every time
And all my life, every time
Every night I run and hide
With you inside my dream
And every time I can't deny
Exactly what this means
Every time, every time
And told my lie
Every time
Every time
If you could only feel
Only feel
What's real
You'd let go
All your walls
And you wouldn't feel here
Every time I see you smile
You get stuck in my head
And every time I can't deny
There's nothing I regret
Every time
Every time
Into my life
Every time
Every time
Every time
Into my life
Every time
Every time
