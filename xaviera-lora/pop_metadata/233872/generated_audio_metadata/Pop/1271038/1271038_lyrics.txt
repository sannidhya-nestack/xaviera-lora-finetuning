Throw a coin in the wishing well
Close my eyes and make a spell
Hope that dreams come true tonight
Under stars so clear, so bright
Echoes whisper, dreams will tell
Shining through this magic shell
Heartbeats racing in the dark
Chasing dreams, a tiny spark
Wishing well, oh can you hear
All my hopes and all my fears
Grant my wish, oh hold me tight
In the silence of the night
When my dance is on the stream
In this moment life's a dream
Wishing in this quiet place
Hope is written on my face
Wishing well, oh can you hear
All my hopes and all my fears
Grant my wish, oh hold me tight
In the silence of the night
Wishing well, oh can you hear
All my hopes and all my fears
Grandma whispers soft and low
Feel the magic start to grow
Wishing well, oh guide the way
Bring me to a brand new day
And she went, "Oh, can you feel it?"
All my hopes and all my fears
Hear the whisper soft and low
Feel the magic start to grow
Wishing well, oh guide the way
Bring me to a brand new day
