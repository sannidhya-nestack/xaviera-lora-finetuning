If it's needed to be then I'll be wrong
all these words and all these songs
Don't mean a damn thing if I don't get to be with you
'Cause baby you're mine and I can't stand the thought of you
Being someone else's man
Won't give up on us
I, I just wanna see your smile
I just wanna touch the sky
I just want us to fly
And I, I don't wanna ever go, go away far from you, no no (no no)
I don't care if you're wrong
Doesn't matter who's right
I'll be damned if I lose you
I need you in my life
I'd rather be wrong than alone and be right
And as long as you're happy I'll let you in the fight
If it's real to me then this is love
I can feel the beat in every song
Doesn't matter at all if I don't get to be with you
'Cause baby your eyes they shine like a star to me
Leading me to your heart
Won't give up on us
I, I just wanna see your smile
I just wanna touch the sky
I just want us to fly
And I, I don't wanna ever go, go away far from you, no no (no no)
I don't care if you're wrong
Doesn't matter who's right
I'll be damned if I lose you
I need you in my life
I'd rather be wrong than alone and be right
And as long as you're happy I'll let you win the fight
I don't care if you're wrong
Doesn't matter who's wrong
I'll be damned if I lose you
I need you in my life
I'd rather be wrong than alone and be right
And as long as you're happy I'll let you win the fight
I don't care if you're wrong
Doesn't matter who's right
I'll be damned if I lose you
I need you in my life
I'd rather be wrong than alone, it'd be right
And as long as we're happy, I'll let you win the fight
I don't care if you're wrong
Doesn't matter who's right
I'll be damned if I lose you
I need you in my life
I'd rather be wrong
Than alone and be right
And as long as you're happy
I'll let you win the fight
I don't care if you're wrong
It doesn't matter who's right
I'll be damned if I lose you
I need you in my life
I'd rather be wrong than alone and be right
And as long as you're happy I'll let you win the fight
