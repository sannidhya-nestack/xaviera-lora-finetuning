All the good love
All the good good love in this world
You know you didn't even have to say
I had a feeling when you stayed away too long
It's no good acting out this fantasy
When everybody and the world can see it's wrong
It's just a fantasy
And all the world can see
All the loving has gone
All the good love, all the good, good loving has gone (oh yeah)
All the good love, all the good, good, good loving has gone
Now I'm just gazing at the sky above
It seems a long time since we had a love
So strong
You know just lately you've been acting strange
I got a feeling that you're gonna change
Your song
Yes you've been acting strange
I know you're gonna change
All the loving has gone
All the good love (all the good love)
All the good good loving has gone (it's all gone)
All the good love
All the good good loving has gone
All the good love is gone
It's just a fantasy
And all the world can see
All the loving has gone
All the good love (all the good love)
All the good good loving has gone (has gone)
All the good love (all the good love)
All the good, good loving has gone (all the good loving has gone)
All the good love (all the good love)
All the good, good loving has gone
All the good love is gone
All the good love
All the good good loving is gone
All the good love is gone
All the good love
