Love so sultry, so enticing, won't you chance a look at me?
Mercury's rising, that's not surprising, you're not like any man I've seen
I feel the heartbeat within my soul
Call out to you so you know you're not alone
If your desire for love should grow
I can take you where you wanna go
Into the night, into the night, love, love
Into the night, into the night, love, love
Into the night, into the night, love, love
Into the night, into the night, love, love
Let's get closer, why don't you near me
Say you'll come away with me
I never get enough of the sweetness in your touch
So take my hand, we'll slip into the night
Don't tell me if I'm dreaming
This love that I believe in is heaven every minute I'm with you
I can feel the love in your kiss
Hey baby listen to this I wanna hold you
All through the night
Into the night into the night love love
Into the night into the night love love
Into the night into the night love love
Into the night into the night love love

I wanna hold you, please you, touch you, feel you, take you, tease you, kiss you, heal you
Baby, I'll never let you go
I wanna hold you, please you, touch you feel you, take you, tease you, kiss you, heal you
Your eyes tell me all I need to know
I wanna hold you, please you, touch you feel you, take you, tease you, kiss you, heal you
Baby, I'll never let you go
I wanna hold you, please you, touch you feel you, take you, tease you, kiss you, heal you
