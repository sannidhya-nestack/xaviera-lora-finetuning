We goin' out to get it
Here's a heads up
We untouchable
So down with the lies of
But we got the beat on
We gonna drop it
No, do you wanna know a secret?
Can you keep it?
Keep it to yourself
Don't let nobody creep it
Baby just leave it
Tell no one else
We are freakin' bright hot
Us ladies know what we've got
Roll it once, roll it twice
You might just hit the gym
We don't care for the day
We just blow it all away
We're leaving for the nightfall
Last call, that's all (in our neighborhood)
We don't care for the change
We're just doing our thing
We're looking out to get some
Get some, we know (in our neighborhood)
In our neighborhood
We cruisin' on the main street like you know me
We unstoppable, raisin' up for the homies who really know me
Feel it out some more
We are freakin' bright, hot as ladies know what we've got
Roll it once, roll it twice you might just hit the jackpot
We don't care for the day
We just blow it all away
We are leaving for the nightfall
Last call, that's all
In our neighborhood
We don't care for the change
We're just doing our thing
We are looking out to get some
Get some, we know
In our neighborhood
In our neighborhood
In our neighborhood
We are freakin' bright, hot
Us ladies know what we've got
Roll it once, roll it twice
You might just hit the jackpot
We don't care for the day
We just blow it all away
We're living for the nightfall
Let's call that's all
In our neighborhood
We don't care for the change
We're just doing our thing
We're looking out to get some
Get some, we know
In our neighborhood
In our neighborhood
