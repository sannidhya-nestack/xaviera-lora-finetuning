You got it all wrong (wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong)
et it, I'm done (done, done, done, done, done)
You made me feel young (young, young, young, young, young)
So get up, turn around
you know I'm gonna shoot you down
Seeing you girl and you're begging for more
Feels like we're dreaming but we're right here for sure
I hear you moving but the mirror says no
But the beating in my heart is telling me to let go
So I can see it clearly when we move move move
Even though I'm sure that you're not true true true
Don't know exactly what to do but girl I know
It's you I wanna show it's you
You got it all wrong
These operations are running through my head
et it I'm done
Even if I was here with you instead
You made me feel young
Baby if I was here with you right now
'Cause you know I'm gonna shoot you down (Wail, wail, wail, wail, wail)
Down (Wail, wail, wail, wail, wail)
She got me falling down
It doesn't look like we're leaving alone
But I got to find you
But I got to find you now
You're so mysterious
The room is spinning us around, around
We go until we all fall down
So I can see it clearly when we move move move
Even though I'm sure that you're not true true true
Don't know exactly what to do but girl I know
It's you I wanna show it's you
You got it all wrong
These apparitions are running through my head
et it I'm done
Even if I was here with you instead
You made me feel young
Maybe if I was here with you right now
So get up and run, cause you know I'm gonna shoot you down
Where where where where where where where where
Down where where where where where where
She got me falling down
Where where where where where where where
Down where where where where where
She got me falling down
I know we're alone
These operations are running through my head
Afraid I can't fight it
Even if I'm still with you instead
You know I can't hide it
Baby it's all the same
It's so calm and ignited
She got me falling
He got it all wrong
et it I'm done
You made me feel young
So get up, turn around,'cause you know I'm gonna shoot you, they got it all wrong
These apparitions are running through my head, et it, I'm done
Even if I was here with you instead, you made me feel young
Maybe if I was here with you right now
So get up, turn around,'cause you know I'm gonna shoot you, they got it all wrong
These apparitions are running through my head
et it, I'm done
Even if I was here with you
You made me feel young
Maybe if I was here with you right now
So get up and run
Cause you know I'm gonna shoot you down (down)
She got me falling down (down)
Cause you know I'm gonna shoot you down
