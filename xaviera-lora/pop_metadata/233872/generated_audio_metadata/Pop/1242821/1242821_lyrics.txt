Together we'll make this, in our candlelit abode
You and me together, hearts no longer on the road
No fancy nights or flashing lights, just you and I alone
In our little haven
Where we made our love a home
No crowded spaces, no more wandering around
Finding joy in silence in the comfort we have found
Every day's a blessing as we dance to our own tune
In our humble castle, love shining like the moon
All's in love
Cozy love
Forever side by side
Wrapped in laughter and warmth
No need to hide
Our little sanctuary
Aiding from the world
Cozy love
Cozy love
Where happiness unfurls
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa
Side, side, side
Wrapped in laughter and warmth
No need to hide
Our little sanctuary
A haven from the world
Cozy love
Cozy love
Yeah, heaven is on first
I'm over you
I'm over you
