It's a bold new day, it all snaps in place
And I'll pop this world wide open for me
It's crazy, no matter what they say
I'm gonna make my way
Gonna bend my fate up, carrying me, they'll see
I've logged some miles in covered ground, paid my dues and now
I feel like a Friday morning sunrise, the good days just ahead
I feel this warm light shining from me
I'll make everything brightest yet
Got some rough plans made
But it's come what may
Gonna jump on board too
Whatever hits me, we'll see
Gonna hold my light
Through any haters spite
And I'll stack this deck up
Purposefully
To a tee
I've got some skills and know-how down
And I'm wide open now and
I feel like a Friday morning sunrise
The good days just ahead
I feel this warm light shining from me
And I'll make everything brightest yet
Nothing's stopping me from rising
Higher, higher, higher, come with me
Be free, completely
Friday morning sunrise
The good day's just ahead
I feel this warm light shining from me
And I'll make everything brightest yet
