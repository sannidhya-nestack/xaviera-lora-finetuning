Eve, life is nice
Hung so delicate on a string
That's tied inside
To an artery from your heart
That supplies no surprise
Than a faltering fool I am
Just a boy, save a man
From the uncertainty of your doubts
I can't pretend
Oh how I
I absolutely adore you
Eve, Eve
Believe when I say
That this isn't about your age
With a sigh you imply
You are questioning my intents
Innocence, depend
Oh how I
Absolutely adore you
Eve
So positively adore you
Even when I say to you that we never should be apart
It's the doubts in your head instead
Did you know I could not comprehend
How much I
I live to adore you
If
Positively adore you
If
They say when you love a woman, try to let it show
I'm not willing to pay you for a thing I do not owe
Eve, life is so nice
Unbegarrious on a string
Take a swing, for love
When you find out how
I long to adore you
Absolutely adore you
If positively adore you
If did I say I adore you
