Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Open the window, let in some light
So I can get a better look at my life
Pieces of paper spread on the floor
There is the notes that'll meet you at eight
I was early, he must've been late
How do you know? You just never know
Ain't gonna cry
I made up my mind
Need to find a way
To be okay
For one more day
So I'll try to fly
Out into the rain, not afraid of the pain, paper airplane
Sift through a shoebox littered with hope
Another goodbye that somebody wrote
I've kept it so long, it's yellowed and torn
Fold it in half, turn up the wings
Toss it away like so many things
Out of the window and into the storm
Ain't gonna cry, I made up my mind
Need to find a way to be okay for one more day
So I'll try to fly out into the rain
Not afraid of the pain, paper airplane
I'm a paper airplane
Flying in the pouring rain
Trying not to crash to the ground
La da da da, la da da da, oh oh oh
La da da da, la da da da, ooh ooh ooh
So I'll try to fly out into the rain
Not afraid of the pain, paper airplane
Out into the rain, not afraid of the pain, paper airplane
