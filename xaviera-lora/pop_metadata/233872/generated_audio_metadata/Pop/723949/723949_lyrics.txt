Too many miles to your home
How can I make it on my own
Why does the road seem so long
How can I ever go on?
So won't you stay here forever in my life
Another day here alone and I will cry
I don't want to lose the one
Who's holding me tight in the night
I need you back into my life
If you stay maybe time can bring us back again
So you'll be mine
This town ain't big enough for you
I know now, but what can I do?
You in that big city light
How can I live by your side?
But I will be strong
And try to work it out
I never had a doubt'cause I don't want to lose the one
Who's holding me tight in the night?
I need you back into my life
If I stay, maybe time can bring us back again
So you'll be mine
If I can't stay there
I know that we will find another place where
We leave it all behind
I don't want to lose the one
Who's holding me tight (holding me tight)
In the night I don't need you back into my life
If we stay (if we stay)
Maybe time (maybe time)
Can bring us back again
I don't want (don't want)
To lose (to lose)
The world, oh
Oh, if I stay, maybe time can bring us back again
I don't want to lose the one
Oh, if I stay, maybe time can bring us back again
And you'll be mine
