Here I am, I know it's been a while
I was in denial about my love
Here I stand, I know I walked away
Had to find the person I'd become
I was high and I was low
Moved through mountains, rain and snow
But I felt that I was further from the truth
On dark and stormy night
Rolling thunder, flashing light
Heard a whisper in the night
And it said
You should go back home
Go back home
Go back home
Go
It's been there all along
You should go back home
Go back home
Go back home
Go
That's where you belong
Here I am, I know it's been a while
I was in denial about my love
Here I stand, I know I walked away
Had to find the person I'd become
I was high and I was low
Moved through mountains, rain and snow
But I felt that I was further from the truth
Dark and stormy night
Rolling thunder, flashing light
Heard a whisper in the night
And it said
You should go back home
Go back home
Go back home
Go
Just been there all along
You should go back home
Go back home
Go back home
Go
That's where you belong
I was high and I was low
Moved through mountains, rain and snow
But I felt that I was further from the truth
Then one dark and stormy night
Rolling thunder, flashing light
Heard a whisper in the night
And it said
You should go back home
Go back home
Go back home
Go
Just been there all along
You should go back home, go back home, go back home, go
That's where you belong
Here I am, I know it's been a while
I was in denial about my love
Here I stand, I know I walked away
Had to find the person I'd become
