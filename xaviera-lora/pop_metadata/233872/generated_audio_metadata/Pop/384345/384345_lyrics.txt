You have been right by my side
Your love has been with me all the time
There is nothing else like your love
Nothing feels like your love, your love
There is nothing else like your love
Nothing feels like your love, your love
What the world needs is your love
So just use me as you can
Let me show true love to every man
It's so hard to show it
Like you have shown to me
That's the love I want the world to see
There is nothing else like your love
Nothing feels like your love, your love
There is nothing else like your love
Nothing feels like your love
Your love
What the world needs is your love
So just use me as you can
Let me show true love to every man
It's so hard to show real love
Like you have shown to me
That's the love I want the world to see
There is nothing else like your love
Nothing feels like your love, your love
There is nothing else like your love
Nothing feels like your love, your love
There is nothing else like your love
Nothing feels like your love, your love
There is nothing else like your love
Nothing feels like your love, your love
Na na na na na na na na na na na na, your love
You're alive
Your love
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
