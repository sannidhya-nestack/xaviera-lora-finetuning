Chasing rainbows
Will you walk with me this time
At the crossroads
Of the worlds of yours and mine
There are dreams that end and dreams that last forever
And it's hard to know the one thing from another
It's not black and it's not white
It's not left and it's not right
Here I am on foreign land at the crossroads
This is what life is all about
But it burns from the inside out
Here we are so close but far chasing rainbows
Far from home, don't wanna walk this world alone
Hearing echoes from a destiny unknown
Sometimes love's the best, sometimes the worst thing ever
Sometimes I'm high, sometimes my head is underwater
It's not black and it's not white
It's not left and it's not right
Here I am, on foreign land, at the crossroads
This is what life is all about, but it burns from the inside out
Here we are, so close but far, chasing rainbows
Chasing rainbows
We chase the rainbows
It's not black and it's not white
It's not left and it's not right
Here I am on foreign land at the crossroads
This is what life is all about
From the inside out
Here we are
So close but far
Chasing rainbows
Chasing rainbows
We're chasing rainbows
Chasing rainbows
