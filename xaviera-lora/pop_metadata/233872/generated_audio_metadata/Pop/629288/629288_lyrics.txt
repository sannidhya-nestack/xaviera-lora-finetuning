One eye, two eyes, a mouth touch my skin
One eye, two eyes, a mouth hold me
One eye, two eyes, a mouth sit so close
One eye, two eyes, a mouth please me
Keep me close, more than you've ever done before
Don't say, don't bend your knees in front of me
Just rise up and be as you please
Just rise up and be as you please
Take me to the place we don't know
There's a picture on the wall
With some island and a show
Would you know, would you know where to go
Would you know where to go
One eye, two eyes, a mouth
Touch my skin
One eye, two eyes, a mouth
Hold me
One eye, two eyes, a mouth
Sit so close
One eye, two eyes, a mouth
