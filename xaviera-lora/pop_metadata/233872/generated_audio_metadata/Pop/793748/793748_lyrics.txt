The sailing has ceased through the storm
My ship wrecked on the shore
So lost here alone, so lost here alone
I'm a castaway
I had a girl back home, now I sleep alone
I took for granted the life that we made
I complicated, I sent the love song
Was a kid but I threw it all away
I can't feel anything that's real
A feeling I see
I'm a castaway No man's an island, but I'm surviving
Just holding on to the love that we had
Gotta get back to you
Girl, I'm going mad
Take a chance, give me faith
I will show you how I feel
You are all that's real
A failing high sea
Through the storm, my ship wrecked on the shore
It's all lost here alone, it's all lost here alone
I'm a castaway
I'm a castaway, I'm a castaway
Castaway, castaway
I'm a castaway, I'm a castaway
Castaway, ooh
You feel like a storm
The rage and then the calm
You feel like a storm
The rage and then the calm
You feel like a storm, the rage and then the cold (rage and then the cold)
You feel like a storm, the rage and then the cold (feeling like a storm)
Through the storm and I see it written on the shore
So lost here, so lost here alone, so lost here alone
I'm a castaway, I'm a castaway (I'm a castaway, I'm a castaway)
Cast away, cast away, cast away, cast away
