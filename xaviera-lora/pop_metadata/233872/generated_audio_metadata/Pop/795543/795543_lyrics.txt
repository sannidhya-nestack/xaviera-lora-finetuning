Deaf-dumb and blind
Is how I hide my darker sides from you
Guess I tried
To make you love the light
My tainted pride to prove
To me
If hearts collide I'll mystify
Two fools
You don't fight
My circle of silence, I'll cast aside for you
Let me breathe in fearless
Breathe out sheer kisses
I'll let you steal the pieces, my heart
Don't let me bleeding needless
Feeling meaningless
Just shelter my release in your arms
Lost my rhyme
Can't scream, can't cry'cause you're inside my core
I'll testify
My guilt, my crime, I can't deny you no more
I'm done
Flying blind, being unaligned with you
I'll sacrifice my circle of silence and bide my time for you
Let me breathe in fearless, breathe out sheer kisses
I'll let you steal the pieces of my heart
Don't let me bleeding needless
Feeling meaningless
Please shelter my release
In your arms
Deaf dumb and blind
I no longer hide my dark side from you
Let me breathe in fearless
Breathe out sheer kisses
I'll let you steal the pieces of my heart
Don't let me bleed any less
Feel it meaningless
Shelter my release
In your arms
Don't let me bleed any less
Feel the meaningless
Please shelter my release
In your arms
