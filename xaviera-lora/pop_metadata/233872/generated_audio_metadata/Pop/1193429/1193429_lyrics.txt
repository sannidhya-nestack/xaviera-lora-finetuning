Whenever you call me, I don't really know what
Kind of a story you'll be laying down
Are you gonna save me, forever damn me
How can you stand there watching me
But you don't get to keep me guessing, no
Sugar, don't sugarcoat it
I just wanna know if you're gonna let me down
You're gonna let me down
Cruelty or easy does it
I just wanna know if you're gonna let me down
Sugar, don't sugarcoat it
How can I reach you when I never touch you?
Taking the journey into your soul
And what can I give you when you don't show me the cards in your hands?
you always fold, you got me, boy
But you don't get to keep me guessing, no
Sugar, don't sugarcoat it
I just wanna know if you're gonna let me down
You're gonna let me down
Cruelly or easy does it
I just wanna know if you're gonna let me down
Sugar, don't sugarcoat it
Don't sugar, don't sugar, don't sugar, don't sugar
Words dripping with honey don't mean a thing
I want you to get to the state
Sugar, don't sugarcoat it
Sugar, don't sugar, don't sugarcoat it
Cruelty or easy does it, I just wanna know if you're gonna let me down, you're gonna let me down
Cruelty or easy does it, I just wanna know if you're gonna let me down
Sugar, don't sugarcoat it
