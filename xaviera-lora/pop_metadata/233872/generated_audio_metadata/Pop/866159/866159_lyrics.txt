I remember how things used to be
You would speak and I would just believe
No one else would matter though
Wouldn't listen to the haters, no
I remember how you'd always say
Even though we were standing in the rain
No storm could stop us now
We're gonna make it home, won't let it go
What was I thinking?
Trying to figure this out on my own
I'm unsure, unsure
I'm unsure, unsure
I believe what you said but they're getting to my head, head
I'm unsure, unsure
I'm unsure, unsure
I believed it from the start but they're getting to my heart
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes, yeah
I keep guessing but you never change
It's a tune that constantly remains
In my heart and in my mind
As the trumpet sounds the walls fall down
What was I thinking
Trying to figure this out
On my own
I'm on show, on show
I'm on show, on show
I believe what you said
But they're getting to my head, head
I'm on show, on show
I'm on show, on show
I believed you from the start
But they're getting to my heart
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Been through this before
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
I've been through this before
I'm unsure, unsure
I'm unsure, unsure
I'm unsure, unsure
I'm unsure, unsure
I'm on show, on show, I'm on show, on show
I believe what you said, put the gun into my hand
I'm on show, on show, I'm on show, on show
I believe before we start, put the gun into my heart
