I'll never get tired of dreaming about you
When I go to sleep you're always
On my mind
Although I know
You never think about me
I'll never get tired of loving you
Something in the way you haunt me
Moves me like nobody else can
Now this
Fantasy won't let me
Make my getaway from dreamland
I'll never get tired of dreaming
About you
When I go to sleep
You're always on my mind
Although I know
You never think about me
I'll never get tired of loving you
Something in the way you haunt me
Moves me like nobody else can
Now the fantasy, it won't let me
Make my getaway from dreamland
I'll never get tired
Of dreaming about you
When I go to sleep
You're always on my mind
Although I know
You never think about me
I'll never get tired of loving you
No, I'll never get tired of loving you
