You're a caveman in a nice suit
When you're angry you look so cute
Got a nice car and a nice voice
But my friends say you're a bad choice
They don't know you, what you good at
With your home slice in your love shack
Yeah we party and take it farther
Cause no one else could party harder
You make it hate
But still I can't start
You make it work
And make it so hard
You make me feel
What I should not
You're the best, bad, best, bad, best, bad idea that I got
You pull me back
Like a slingshot, then I can fly until I get caught
Between your eyes, I hit the jackpot
You're the best, best, best, best, best idea that I got
Your time bomb about to blow up
you do dude, you better show up
your go-to wants a me time
Every hour better be mine
your game needs a little frosting
Get your checkbook'cause they be costing
A little chump change, a little cash down
Then you'll hear me sing my sweet sound
You'll make it hurt
But still I can't start
You make it work
And make it so hard
You make me feel
What I should not
You're the best, best, best, best, best idea that I got
You pull me back, like a slingshot
Then I can fly, until I get caught
Between your arms, I eat the jackpot
You're the best bet, best bet, best bet I've yet that I got
You make it hurt, but I can't stop
You make it work, make it so hot
You make me feel what I should not
In your eyes, I see what I want
Let me give you all I got
You make it hate
But still I can't start
You make it work
And make it so hard
You make me feel
What I should not
You're the best, bad, best, bad, best, bad idea that I got
You pull me back like a slingshot
Then I can fly until I get caught
Between your eyes I eat the jackpot
You're the best, best, best, best, best idea that I got
