When did you go? When did I come? When will I hold my head up high?
Someone who keeps playing games
When did we laugh, when did you cry
When will I ever understand why
Someone doesn't feel the same
Oh there's a road that I must travel
And there's a world on a tilted wheel
A crystal river falls from heaven
Salted emotions brushed my cheek
When did you kill, when did you lie
When will I ever tell you why
Someone doesn't know the way
When will this world ever laugh
When will we ever make up our minds
Somehow there's no time for change
Oh there's this road that we must travel
And there's this heart on a tilted wheel
The crystal river, oh it falls from heaven
Salted emotions stay and brushed my cheek
