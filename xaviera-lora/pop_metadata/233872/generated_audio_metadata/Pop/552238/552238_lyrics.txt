When I met you, you were not that kind
Self-conceited, too self-satisfied
We were opposites in every way
In every kind of way
Oh ain't it funny how life can change
In a single day
Now here we are baby
Lazy by love
When you touch me sweet and softly
I know I'm in luck
And now the rain is falling
It's cold outside my darling
So won't you stay tonight?
I was biased by your kind of man
I even judged you before I knew your name
Oh there was a similarity in our ways of life
Ain't it funny how the first sign
Isn't always right
Now here we are baby
Lazy violet
When you touch me sweet and softly
I know I'm in love
And now the rain is falling
It's cold outside my darling
So won't you stay tonight
Stay tonight
It took us so long to see why everyone already knew
No matter how different we may seem
Oh, I belong to you
Yes, I do, do, do
Now here we are, baby
Lazy by love
And you touch me sweeter softly
I know I'm in love
And now the rain is falling
It's colder outside, my darling
Now here we are baby
Lazy from love
When you touch me sweet and softly
I know I'm in love
And now the rain is falling it's cold
Cold my darling oh oh
So won't you stay tonight
Stay tonight
Oh, baby, oh, darling, mm-mm
So won't you stay here tonight?
