Her walls were up and was down
Getting through a long cold winter she was summer bound
She had on a yellow dress underneath her worn out coat
Hoping she could show it off when she penned her goodbye note
She felt like a tiny grain of sand
Falling through a tired weary hand
Wish I could've stopped her
But a force of nature wouldn't let her change her mind
He looked around, found an empty space
Down on earth he saw your tired face
And put his arms around you and lifted you to rest
His garden is so beautiful
You know he only takes the best
She felt like a tiny grain of sand
Falling through the fingers of a man
Wish I could've stopped her
But a force of nature wouldn't let her
No, a force of nature couldn't help her change her mind
The mind is a minefield of emotion
Never really understanding
But I wish I could change your mind for good
She felt like a tiny grain of sand
Falling through her tired weary hand
She felt like a tiny grain of sand
Falling through the fingers of a man
She felt like a tiny grain of sand
Falling through her weary weary hand
Wish I could've stopped her
But a force of nature wouldn't let her
No, a force of nature couldn't help her
No, a force of nature wouldn't let her change her mind
