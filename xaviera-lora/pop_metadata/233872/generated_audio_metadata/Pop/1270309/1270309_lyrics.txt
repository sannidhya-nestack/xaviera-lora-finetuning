Walking down the empty street
Stars alight they softly greet
Dreams that fade but still are so sweet
Just like you and I could meet
Whispers in the midnight air
Echoes of a love so rare
Underneath the skies we stare
Wonder if you still care
Once in a blue moon, I think of you
Once in a blue moon, dreams come true
City lights are fading slow
Memories they start to glow
Through the darkness we both know
Stories of our hearts they show
Time can't change what we feel
Every moment feels so real
Hand in hand the world we steal
Love that never needs to heal
Once in a blue moon I think of you, of you
Once in a blue moon dreams come true
Once in a blue moon
When I think of you
Once in a blue moon
Dreams come true
City lights are fading slow
Memories they start to glow
Through the darkness we both know
Stories of our hearts they show
Time can change what we feel
Every moment feels so real
Hand in hand the world we steal
Love that never needs to heal
Once in a blue moon
I think of you
I think of you
Once in a blue moon
Dreams come true
Dreams come true
Once in a blue moon
I think of you
I think of you
Once in a blue moon
Dreams come true
Dreams come true
Dreams come true
