Mixing my own drinks, keep it strong, try not to think
Wearing that dress that I know you like'cause
I only came here to see if I would see you
I ended up in a state I didn't mean to
Waking up in the morning dizzy, I'm hungover, was I?
Was I saying things that aren't true?
Was I doing things I shouldn't do?
Was I doing it all, doing it all?
I'm mad at you
Was I drinking an up-a-two?
Was I dancing with some other dude?
Was I doing it all, doing it all?
I'm mad at you
Yeah, I'm mad at you, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Your name on my phone
Asking if I made it home
I didn't think before I told you
I only went there to see if I would see you
I ended up in a state I didn't mean to
Woke up in the morning and you never
Who came over?
Was I saying things that aren't true?
Was I doing things I shouldn't do?
Was I doing it all, doing it all?
I'm mad at you
Was I drinking an up-a-two?
Was I dancing with some other dude?
Was I doing it all, doing it all?
I'm mad at you
Yeah, I'm mad at you
And I'm sorry I get caught up in the stupid things
I only went there to see if I would see you
I ended up in a state I didn't mean to
Say things that aren't true
Or do things I shouldn't do
I was doing it all, doing it all'cause I was mad at you
Drank in an up-a-tude, was out dancing with some other dude
I was doing it all, doing it all'cause I was mad at you
Just mad at you
Yeah, I was doing it all, doing it all'cause I was mad at you
That I could
