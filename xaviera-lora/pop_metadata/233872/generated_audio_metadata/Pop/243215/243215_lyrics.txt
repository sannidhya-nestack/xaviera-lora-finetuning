I never thought I'd fall in love at first sight
That was for dreamers on a starry night
My heart told me when I looked into your eyes
We'd never say goodbye
When we're alone and you reach for my hand
That loving gesture means you understand
There's no treasure like being with you
We'll never say goodbye
If time should try to end our romance
It wouldn't have a chance
Safe in my heart
We'll never be apart
Sometimes it seems that we're living in a dream (in a dream)
Moments passing in a rushing stream
If I could have one fantasy to fill
I'd make time stand still
If time should try to end our romance
It wouldn't have a chance
It wouldn't have you be here safe in my heart
We'll never be apart
If I knew this would be our last day
There's nothing more I would need to say
To keep the memories
We'll never say good-bye, never say good-bye
