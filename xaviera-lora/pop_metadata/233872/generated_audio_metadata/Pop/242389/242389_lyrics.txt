You just don't make me smile
It's been that way a while
It's better that we go
Since we know it's not working
Goodbye is not a failure
When it's better to walk away
So if you must know the reason
You just don't make me smile
I'd rather live alone than living in a home
Where there is no joy, no trust or no freedom
You know, you know that I'm not lying
And what I say is so true
So if you must know the reason
You just don't make me smile
Over and over we keep going over
Your words put a sting in my heart
I keep on trying but you think I'm lying
You say we could make a new start
But there's one thing you're etting
You just don't make me smile
It's better that you go without an angry show
It's better for us both to move on from this story
We loved and lost my darling
It's time to say goodbye
Don't slam the door as you're leaving
You just don't make me smile
You just don't make me smile
You just don't make me smile
