Breaking out of these chains I feel you running through my veins
Silhouettes painted on the floor Stepping on roses by the door
It's getting hard to breathe now you're controlling me
One touch is ecstasy every time
I feel it rushing in, I feel you on my skin
I don't know where you've been
We could do this all day, I'm coming for ya
So come on baby press play, I know you want it
I could do this all day, I'm coming for ya
So come on baby press play, I know you want it
So come on baby press play
Press play
So come on baby press play
Press play
Breaking out of these heels
The way you're making me feel
Shadows written on the wall
And I've been waiting so long
It's getting hard to breathe
Now you're controlling me
One touch is ecstasy every time
I feel it rushin' in, I feel you on my skin
I don't know where you've been
We could do this all day, I'm comin' for ya
So come on baby, press play, I know you want it
I could do this all day, I'm comin' for ya
So come on baby, press play, I know you want it
So come on baby, press play
Press play
So come on baby, press play
I can give you everything you need
I'll be with you until the sun burns out
I can give you everything you need
So come on baby just press play
We could do this all day
I'm coming for ya
So come on baby press play
I know you want it
I could do this all day
I'm coming for ya
So come on baby press play
I know you want it
So come on baby press play
Press play
We could do this all day
I'm coming for ya
So come on baby press play
I know you want it
I could do this all day
I'm coming for ya
So come on baby press play
I know you want it
So come on baby press play
Press play
(I know you want it)
So come on baby press play
Press play, so come on baby press play
