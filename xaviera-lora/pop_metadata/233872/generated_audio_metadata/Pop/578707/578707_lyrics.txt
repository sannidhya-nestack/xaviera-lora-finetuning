Under attack, dazed and all consumed
to quit'cause I think you're filthy cute
Divin' into deep, divin' into deep
Feels like I'm divin' into deep
Disarmed and drunk on you
Saw my flaws layin' bare like an open book
They make you smile like a kid with a Rubik's Cube
Flying without wings, flying without wings
Feels like I'm flying without wings and free falling for you
Lost my breath from how you turned me on
A damn fine mess I ain't running from
Fire as you will, fire as you will
Come on fire as you will and please shoot to kill
If I would die
In your arms (whoa-oh)
Paradise will be the sweet (oh)
I'll be damned if it's for real (whoa-oh)
heaven would be hell to me (oh)
You could be my iron lung, my life support (oh)
I'd stay forever young without a heart
If I would die in your arms
I would've bet the time of my life if it was sealed by you
You're a wildfire spreading a burning love in jeans
I'll burn alive and I'll be soaked in sunscreen
Gonna let it go, gonna let it go
I'm gonna let it go'til you make me scream
Lost my breath
From how you turn me on a damn fine mess
I ain't running from
Fire as you will, fire as you will
Come on, fire as you will and please shoot to kill
If I would die in your arms
Paradise would be the sweet
I'll be damned if it's for real (whoa)
heaven would be hell to me (oh)
You could be my high of the line, my life support (oh)
I'd stay forever young without a heart
If I would die in your arms (oh)
I would have met the time of my life
If I would die in your arms
Ooh-ah-oh, ooh-ah-oh
If I would die in your arms (I would die)
Ooh-ah-oh, ooh-ah-oah (Die in your arms)
Ooh-ah-oh, ooh-ah-ooh
If I would die in your arms
I would thank the gods for irony
If I would die in your arms
Paradise would be the sweet
I'll be damned if it's for real (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
heaven would be hell to me (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You could be my eye of the law, my life support (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'd stay forever young without a heart (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh), if I would die in your arms (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
I wouldn't bet the time of my life if it was sealed by you
