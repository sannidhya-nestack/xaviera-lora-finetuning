I'd like to know just what you use
Oh, a strange kind of love mixed with the blues
I'd like to know, creeped in my heart
Came in the night, broke my heart
And gave me the blues
I dream a dream, it's about you
Of the sweet tenderness, sweet but so blue
But I know you've gone and you seem so near
You're just across town about a million miles from here
Oh I know you're close and your heart's so near
But your eyes always say that you're not here
It breaks my heart, my heart and my soul
'Cause it's time to say goodbye
And I just can't let go
I'm not afraid
To know this way
Heaven sent me a dream
And took it away
It's time to go live from here
As far as I can just about a million miles from here
I'm not afraid to go this way
Heaven sent me a dream and took it away
It's time to go away from here
As far as I can, just about familiar
Miles from here
