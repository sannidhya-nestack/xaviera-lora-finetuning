Meet me when the moon's rising
And if you're cold I'll let you in
I don't care much'bout where you've been
If you're cold I'll hold you near
The fireside is burning
And the world outside keeps turning round and around
But if you and I are spinning
Time stands still for a minute
Soak your skin in the water
I'll pay no mind if you're not much of a talker
When you act dry, food has made you stronger
We'll cut our ties and break for the border
But while the fire inside is burning
The world outside keeps turning round and round
If you and I are spinning
Time stands still for a minute
