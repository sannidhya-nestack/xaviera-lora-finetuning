Try to pretend I care
And listen to what she says
I wanna go even though
We just got here
Feel like I waste her time
Feel like I'm wasting mine
It ain't her fault I know
She's just not her
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Waiting for that final day
But it doesn't work that way
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Guess it doesn't work that way
There comes a time, there comes a day
Everything's fine, all is okay
It's not today, but I'm on my way
Never enough, keep moving on
Don't know how much, don't know how long
It's not today, but I'm on my way
It's not today
But I'm on my way
It's not today
But I'm on my way
Everyone says move on
Everyone says she's gone
I don't wanna hear but they
Keep on talking, taking it day by day
Try not to drift away, I'll get there one day so I'll
Keep on walking, what are you waiting for
What are you waiting for?
Keys and boxes everywhere
Didn't plan to end up here
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Didn't plan to end up here
There comes a time, there comes a day
Everything's fine, all is okay
It's not today, but I'm on my way
Never enough, keep moving on
Don't know how much, don't know how long
It's not today, but I'm on my way
It's not today
But I'm on my way
It's not today
What are you waiting for?
It's not today
What are you waiting for?
It's not today
But I'm on my way
