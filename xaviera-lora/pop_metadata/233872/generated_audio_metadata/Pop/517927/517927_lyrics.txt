Holding on to what you can
But don't hold too tight, you might end up
Cutting off your loose ends
Don't pretend you're someone else
I know you're thinking of yourself
It's not if you can play it safe
You're still gonna throw it all away
I will walk and you will run
You're nothing but a runaway
Yeah, I want you to stay
Or is it that if I walk and you run this just turns into a race
Yeah I want you to stay here with me
Here with me
Every dog can have its day
Yeah every man can have his ball and chain
To me it's all the same
Yeah everything's not a win or lose
Why can't we make our own rules
It's not how well you play the game
It's what you do along the way
If I walk and you run
You're nothing but a runaway
I want you to stay
Or is it that if I walk and you run
This just turns into a race
Yeah, I want you to stay
Can you make a change, now play it safe
Can you struggle through this for my sake
Or is there being too much to take
Can you make a change, now play it safe
Can you say this to me face to face
I can't wait for today
If I walk and you run
You're nothing but a runaway
Yeah, I want you to stay
I want you to stay
If I walk, you run, you're nothing but a runaway
Yeah, I want you to stay
Why is it that if I walk, you run, this just turns to a race?
Yeah, I want you to stay, stay, stay, stay
Yeah, stay, stay, stay, stay here with me
