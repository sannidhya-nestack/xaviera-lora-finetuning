A moment's glance, a silver sea
Hazy daydreams of where I want to be
A whispered secret, a soft refrain
A kiss as tender as warm sweet summer rain
Sitting here, all fingers and thumbs waiting for my muse to come
Tip toe with me to the highest hill
The air is cool and so very still
I want to sleep in Italy in Tuscan fields of golden green
A gentle grace in the late day sun
To taste the vine, I know the day is done
Big sky country
The tallest trees
An empty canvas for all my blues and greens
A new direction is what I need
A desert landscape, a different air to breathe
Sitting here, all fingers and thumbs are waiting for my inspiration
Walk with me to the highest hill
The air is cool and so very still
I want to sleep in Italy in golden fields of Tuscany
A gentle grace in the late day sun
To taste the vine and know the day is done
Your placid heart, your plain routine
Such starvation cannot be seen
It's not mean, I won't hush
Or take an hour to feel the rush
Still sitting here
All fingers and thumbs are waiting for my inspiration
Tiptoe with me to the highest hill
The air is cool and so very still
I want to sleep in Italy in golden fields of Tuscany
A gentle grace in the late day sun
To taste the vine and know the day is done
Big sky country, tall grass trees
The tallest trees, empty canvas
For all my blues and greens, for all my blues and greens
A moment's glance, a silver sea
Hazy daydreams of where I want to be
Where I want to be
