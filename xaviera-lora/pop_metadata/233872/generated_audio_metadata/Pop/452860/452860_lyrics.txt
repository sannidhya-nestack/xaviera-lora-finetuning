Three hours'til the sun comes up
Another sleepless night
Will I make it through another day
Walking the tightrope to my dreams
I gotta find a way to open the gates
And call sweet angels to communicate
And tell dark demons that keep me awake
To stop calling my name
I close my eyes, let sweet angels sing
Drown out the shadows I've been sleeping in
I dream of becoming one within these worlds
I dream of becoming one
I dream of becoming one within these worlds
I dream of becoming one
A dripping tap swallows the gap
My only friend
Sweet music paves a narrow escape
Through the starless nights
I've been watching shadows dance on my walls
Relieved they fade as the new sun calls
Chimes peruate in the breeze
That's when the rainbows tiptoe in
If I listen close and keep real still
Maybe they'll show me I don't need no appeal
I dream of becoming one within these worlds
I dream of becoming one
I dream of becoming one within these worlds
I dream of becoming one
There's a place where
Worlds collide, you can touch your dreams
Sparks inside your heart ignite
Angels take demons by the hands till they sway in their own
Sweet romance painting rainbows and laughing
I dream of becoming one within these worlds
I dream of becoming one
I dream of becoming one within these worlds
I dream of becoming one
I dream of becoming one within these walls
I dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one
