Guess what color is her hair?
Red, red, the world is red, red like my hair
Red, red, the world is red, red like my hair
Mother bought me a dress today it was red so I said
No mommy I can't stay here
My daddy bought a new car today it was red so I said
I gotta run way but far
Red red the world is red red like my head
Red, red, the world is red, red like my head
What's your favorite color? I asked my friend
It was red, so I said
This must be the day that I can't stand (red, red)
The world is red, red like my head
Red, red, the world is red, red like my head
It's goddamn red
Think I'm going crazy baby
I think I'm just too lazy baby
I think I'm going crazy, baby
I think I'm just too lazy, baby
Red, red, the world is red, red like my head
Red, red, the world is red, red like my head
Red, red, the world is red, red like my head
Red, red, the world is red, red like my head
