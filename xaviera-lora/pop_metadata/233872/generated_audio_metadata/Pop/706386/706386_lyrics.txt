It never worked out fine, I watched it fall away
It slipped right through my fingers as I heard you say
We're still the same, you know I feel the stillness
Feel the stillness now with all the days we learned
We're always one, we're always one
You said never let me go (you said never let me go)
You said never let me go (you said never let me go)
You said never let me go (you said never let me go)
You said never let me go (you said never, never let me go)
Just when you think it's done, it comes right back at you
And you can't find the light they said would guide you through
We're still the same, you say
And I can't hear your voice, I hear your voice
It's no good answering
If this is not your choice, it's my choice
You said, never let me go
You said, never let me go
You said never let me go (You said never let me go)
You said never let me go (You said never let me go)
Remember then
In the lines of my face
Would you know me now?
Not here in my place
You said never let me go (You said never let me go)
You said never let me go (You said never let me go)
You said never let me go (You said never let me go)
You said never let me go (You said never let me go)
