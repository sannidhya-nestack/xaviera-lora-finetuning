There's a light outside my window
As the thoughts go through my mind
Where there's only one thing missing
To be with you one more time
So I've got something new to say to you
In my life I have been alone
How long, just how long
Can I endure this heartache too
It seems to disappear when you're here soon
I think I'll get the answer
To the question of my heart
Well I'm ready to go forward
If we just give it a start
So I've got something new to say to you
In my life I have been alone
How long
Just how long, just how long
Can I endure this heartache too?
It seems to disappear when you're here
And maybe this time this could be love
And maybe this time she will stay here with me tonight
And maybe this time this could be love (or could it be love, or could it be love)
And maybe this time she will stay here with me tonight
So I've got something new to say to you
In my life I have been alone
How long, just how long, just how long
Can I endure this heartache too?
It seems to disappear when
You're here
And maybe this time this could be love
And maybe this time she will stay here with me tonight
And maybe this time this could be love
Or could it be love? Or could it be love?
And maybe this time she will stay here with me tonight
And maybe this time, maybe this time
Could it be love, could it be love?
Maybe this time, maybe this time
Could it be love? Could it be love?
Maybe this time, maybe this time
Could it be love? Could it be love?
