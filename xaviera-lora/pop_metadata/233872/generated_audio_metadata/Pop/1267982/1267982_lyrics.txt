Fallen leaves, soft and slow
Whispers in the air, don't let go
Golden light, fade too soon
I write these words for you
Autumn poems, quiet and free
Every light that's you I see
In the rustling trees, in the cold breeze
You're the warmth inside of me
Raindrops tap the windowpane
I trace your name again and again
The world is calm in shades of grey
But your love colors my day
Autumn poems quiet and free
Every light that's you I see
In the rustling trees
In the cold breeze
You're the warmth inside of me
These words, they fall like autumn rain
Soft and steady, calling your name
These words, they fall like autumn rain
Soft and steady, calling me name
