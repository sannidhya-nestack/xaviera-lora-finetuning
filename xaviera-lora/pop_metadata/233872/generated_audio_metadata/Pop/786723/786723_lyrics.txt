I'm in the white heat out on my concrete knees to the pavement I spit
I'm making reds and blues running violent hues and I'm dizzy from it
I'm coming after like a rusted balloon
You'll see me blinking with my inside jamming
I could be the one making diamonds out of blood
Cutting my velvet
I could be the one with the paper on my tongue
I'm dizzy from it
All these moving pictures making me sick
I get dizzy, I get dizzy from it
I'm in the main arcade, the electric lane and it's painfully bright
With alibinous bleeding, rupinous noise and poisonous light
I'm coming up dead like a ruptured balloon
You'll see me blinking with my inside dilute
I could be the one making diamonds out of love
Catching my breath
I could be the one with the paper on my tongue
I'm dizzy from it
All these moving pictures making me sick
I get dizzy, I get dizzy from it
I held the map up in my hands
It led and all the colours ran
I saw the symbols and the words but
When I blinked, the colors blurred
I could be the one
I could be the one
Of these moving pictures making me sick
I get dizzy, I get dizzy from it
All these moving pictures making me sick
I get dizzy, I get dizzy from it
