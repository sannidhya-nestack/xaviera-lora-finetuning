I walked outside today
The rain was freezing cold
The sky was dark
And the clouds were blue
I picked up a leaf, a single golden leaf With coral running through
Here's the beauty that life provides
Here's the wonder that life
I held my baby today
His body was so warm
His pale grey eyes
While they're just like his fathers
He reached out his hand, reached for my love
My heart just overflowed
Here's the beauty that life provides
Is the wonder that life provides
Prayed for healing today
My friend's been fading away
I sent her light
And I just kept sending
She called me on the phone
The sound of her voice
Stronger than before
Here's the beauty that life provides
Here's the wonder that life
Provides
Here's the beauty
Here's the wonder
I can feel the compassion
And I know there's a power life
Provides
All I provide
Here's the beauty
Here's the wonder
Here's the beauty
Here's the wonder, here's the beauty, here's the wonder
