Gone a while, can't slow down
Everyday feels like a battleground
Clock keeps ticking, gotta keep moving
No time to rest, no time for losing
Phone keeps ringing, messages explode
Too many demands, too much to decode
Meetings and deadlines they never end
Drowning in a do list that won't bend
Busy, busy as a bee
Buzzing'round so tirelessly
Got no time to unwind
Gotta keep the grind
But sometimes I just need to find some peace of mind
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Some peace of mind
Everyday feels like a battleground
Clock keeps ticking
Gotta keep moving
No time to rest
No time for losing
