As I take a knee, I can hardly breathe
Hope it's the scene you pictured in your dreams
I can see it clear through my happy tears
Just like the sun, you're golden, shine like a chandelier
My heart
Everything, let it start with this ring
We'll never part, I'm on to bring you home forever
With this ring, with this ring
I can feel you smile as you walk the aisle
The way you wear your white sole, sugar wild
Today's the day again
To say my 24-karat promise heard across the Milky Way
My heart, everything, let it start
With this ring, we'll never part
I'm gonna bring you home forever
With this rain, with this rain
It's a perfect world on a magic day
Waited all my life just to see your face
You're my angel, my sweet twist of fate, yeah
I will sing this tune when we're ninety-two
You'll still be the only girl in the room
You got my heart, everything
Let it start with this ring
We'll never part, I'm gonna bring you home forever
With this ring, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything, let it start
With this ring, we'll never part
I'm gonna bring you home forever
With this ring, with this ring
