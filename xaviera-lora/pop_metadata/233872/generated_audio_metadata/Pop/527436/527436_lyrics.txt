Everybody wants a place in the sun
Well I don't know
Can't take the heat it will burn you up
Everybody wants to dance till dawn
But nobody knows
What's the time when the sun comes up
Everybody wants to sing their own song
Well don't you know
That the world ain't big enough
But you can listen to the one you love
I'm a beady joke girl and a queen
I'm a be like china and smithereens
I was born to love the beauty and less irony
I'm a be a rose in a frozen field
Cause I'm a love the beauty and less irony
Everybody wants to be number one
Don't it just sound dumb
Guess number two is having all the fun
Everybody wants to rule the world
But it sounds absurd
Guess the one who tried have been badly hurt
Remember love ain't no dirty word
I'ma be the joker and the queen
I'ma be like Shia LaBeouf and Smithereens
I was born to love the beauty in life's irony (ah, ah)
I'mma be a rose in a frozen field (ah, ah)
I'mma love the beauty in life's irony
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
We can be the jokers and the queens
We can be like china and smithereens
We were born to love the beauty in life's irony
We can be like flowers in frozen fields
We're gonna love the beauty in life's irony
