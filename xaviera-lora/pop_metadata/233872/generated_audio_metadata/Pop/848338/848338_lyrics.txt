I don't need phone calls, I don't need reasons tonight
Why I should go home
I don't need planning, I don't need logic'cause I
Know it never shows where I wanna go, wanna go now
Where I wanna be, I wanna be now
I wanna stay, wanna stay now
Somewhere near you
I don't need something to make me believe that it's wrong
What we're doing now
And I don't need someone or anyone pointing at me
When I hide in crowds'cause I wanna go, wanna go now
Where I wanna be, I wanna be now
Yes, I wanna stay, I wanna stay now
Without judgement
Sticking around you for the night
Now should we find ourselves spinning backwards
Choosing the right kind of wrong
Should we give up for age really matters
While empty numbers are doubt
No, I do not expect no answers
And I don't need no reasons why
I sincerely need no understanding
tonight
We're drifting away from time
I don't wanna know, wanna know now
Where I gotta go, gotta go now
I wanna stay, wanna stay now
Somewhere near you
