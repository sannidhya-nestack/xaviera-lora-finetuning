Come to me
Sit right here and rest a while
Let our energies collide
Set aside those other things
Here with me
Open up and close the door
Don't have to be so distant
So don't hold back and let yourself release
And share what's on your mind
I'll take your pain away
Let the words come through you
Release
Please confide it all in me
Let go and look no further
I am always here
Next to me
Hear the silence slip away
Pour it out and let me in
I'm never judging you
Trust in me
And you'll never be let down
The words twist up inside you
So don't hold back and let yourself release
And share what's on your mind
I'll take your pain away
Let the words come through you
Release, confide it all in me
Let go and look no further
I am always here
Release and share what's on your mind
I'll take your pain away
Let the words come through you
Release, confide it all in me
Let go and look no further
I am always here
