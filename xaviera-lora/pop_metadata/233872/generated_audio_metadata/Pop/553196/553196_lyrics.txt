I watch you in the rain
Hiding by the bench
By the house where we stayed
You know I'm still there
You know I'm watching
You know what love is
It's just like the air that you breathe
I search for signs in the night
Hiding by the bed where I held on to be kissed
You know I'm still there
You know I'm watching
A basic necessity
A basic necessity
Kiss me and we'll be
Bound by my own nothingness
Kill me so I can remain
Bound by my own sadness
I watch you walking to the train
Thinking I'm holding air by the flower shop
You see me behind the window
Just a note behind the shadow
A painless necessity
Facing necessity
I whisper through the day
The night is a song of love
But I'm a wandering soul
You might leave today
But I'm stuck beyond life
Kiss me and we'll
Bound by my own nothingness
Kill me so I can remain
Bound by my own sadness
Now we're loving
It's just a silver 14K
Basic necessity
A basic necessity
You know what love is
A basic necessity
A basic necessity
A basic necessity
