I lay myself down on the floor
I feel the world is turning'round
And I don't really need to push
What's nice to see you now go home
I see you with a kiss, a perfect goodbye
Ah, moments like this are hard to come by
Ah, don't tell me your name, I don't wanna know
Oh, don't want you to stay
Just kiss me and go
Oh
You hit me up when I am down
I turn my back to you and frown
I had my sorry share of padding on my head
I'm only up to go to bed
I feel the world is turning'round and I don't really need to push
What's nice to see you now go home, leave me alone
I see you with the keys, a perfect goodbye, ah
Moments like these are hard to come by, ah
Don't tell me your name, I don't wanna know
Oh, I don't want you to stay, just kiss me and go
Oh, leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
I see you with a kiss, a perfect goodbye, ah
Moments like these are hard to come by, ah
Don't tell me your name, I don't wanna know, oh
Don't want you to stay, just kiss me and go, oh
