This kind of thing is a tragedy when it's about a girl like me
I'm falling for the illusion that a little boy wants me to see
I like to think I'm immune to him when he does the things he do
Believing I am the only one that he's ever gonna do it to
There's nothing I can do about it when I give him his kiss
I think I can do without it but I gotta Jones for this
I never thought I'd be the fool again but it, that's the way it appears
I'm hanging on the phone line in the middle of the night accompanied by only my tears and
It's a sad day if he gets his way like he always does
I click my heels three times hoping to God that I get back to the way that I was, yeah
There's nothing I can do about it when I give him his kiss
I think I can do without it but I gotta Jones for this
In my mind I tell myself that I belong with some
One else in my head
I'm such a mess
But that's the way love goes
I guess there's nothing I can do about it when I'm
Yeah, I found this kiss
I think I can do without it
But no, no, no, there's nothing I can do about it, baby
When I'm in this kiss
I think I can do without it
But I gotta chose for this
I do believe it
