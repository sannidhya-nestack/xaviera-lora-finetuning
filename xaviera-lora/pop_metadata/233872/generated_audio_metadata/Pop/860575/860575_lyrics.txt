I et everything, try again and again
Just to say how it is but it's hard to begin
Am I fooling myself? There's just nobody else
Maybe love is a wish that will lead a little hell
Do you see me at all?
Do you need me at all?
Is it unrequited?
Tell me before I'm losing my mind
you're one of a kind
In your world I'm falling a little behind
So when I wake up alone and I'm still here on my own
Without you time will remind me the hours will go slow
I surrender myself I'm embraced in the unknown
I want you, I'm still out here waiting for something you don't show
If you don't have a heart
If it's cold or maybe love
Just let me convince you I'm all that you want
Can't you pick up the phone
Call you know that I'm home
Again they're playing a love song on the radio
So when I wake up alone and I'm still here on my own
Without you time will remind me the hours we go slow
I surrender myself and embrace in the unknown
I want you and still I'm waiting for something you don't show
You don't show
Something you don't show
When you don't reply
I am paralyzed
Can a broken heart mend itself?
And I can't deny
I am terrified
I'm not ready to say farewell
I wake up alone and I'm still here on my own
Without you
Time will remind me the hours will go slow, oh
I surrender myself, I'm embracing the unknown
I want you, but still I'm waiting for something you don't show
So when I wake up alone and I'm still here on my own
Without you, time will remind me the hours will go slow, oh
I surrender myself, I'm embracing the unknown
I want you, but still
Something you don't show (Something you don't show)
Something you don't show
Something you don't show
