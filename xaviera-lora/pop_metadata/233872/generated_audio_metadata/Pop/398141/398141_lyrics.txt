You find yourself just reading all the headlines
Never digging too deep for a cause
VCRs, car phones, old credit cards, and golfing you'll spend time
Don't bring me down'cause the war don't exist in my town
Don't box yourself
Don't box yourself
Don't box yourself all the way in
You find yourself with your head down on the subway
Your walkman's on and you're buried in some magazine
Avoiding their eyes, you're free to your lies, that's what some say
Don't bring me down'cause the war might exist in my town
Don't box yourself
Don't box yourself
Don't box yourself all the way in
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting
Now don't get me wrong, I ain't some kind of saint sent from heaven
As a matter of fact, I probably descend from hell
If you look around, all self-serving ain't driven
But I get brought down'cause the world shall resist in my town
Don't box yourself
Don't box yourself
Don't box yourself
All the way in
Don't box yourself
Don't box yourself
Don't box yourself all the way in
All the way in, all the way in
All the way in, all the way in
All the way in, all the way in
All the way in, all the way in, all the way in, all the way in
