I would run all the way to you
Across the land that no man's crossed to
Take it back to 1950 (take it back, take it back)
Just to say we're smoking healthy (smoking healthy)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm taking your photograph
From the memory of this place
If you can't feel my love
Then I'll try another day
Singing oh, oh, oh, oh
Singing oh, oh, oh, oh
I will go, let me go
I swear I'd go all the way for ya
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'd buy a car that we can ride in
And fly away like old Greece lightning
Take a train to your favorite diner
You can hold my hand if you wanna
I'm taking your photograph and the memory of this face
If you can't feel my love then I'll try another day
Singing oh oh oh, singing oh oh oh
I will go, let me go, I swear I'll go
All the way for ya (I will go, let me go, I swear I'd go)
All the way for ya
All the way for ya
Mmm, yeah
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
I'm taking your photograph from the memory of this face
If you can't feel my love then I'll try another day
Singing oh oh oh
Singing oh oh oh
I will go let me go I swear I'd go all the way for you
I will go let me go I swear I'd go all the way for you
