I was born to eliminate any of your mistakes
All the big rocks put it out my way didn't cause me to forsake
Just one little thing
Reminds me of the dig and the pay
And the beast that I meet
They never believe
That the sun has made them weep
All the plans that I have made
Finally become real
So many years without any change
To me it was no big deal
But some odd sunny day
And the beasts that I meet
They never believe
That the sun has made them real
The time has come to say goodbye
And I'm to leave you far behind
The time has come to say goodbye
And I'm to leave you far behind
My heart belongs to you
My love will always be true
My heart belongs to you
My love will always be true
Yeah
