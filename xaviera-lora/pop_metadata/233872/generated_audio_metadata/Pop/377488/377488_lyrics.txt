Take my place, change my face
No one will miss a man like this
Rearrange, cry for change
Come around, underground
Who's next in line now?
It's raining overhead
There's bullets in your bed
You'll never get back home
The seeds already sown
It's what your king demands
Offense around his lines
This part you do alone
The seed's already sown
Already sown
Gather for war
Storm that shore
Not much choice
Your useless voice
Faithful sleep
Like God's good sheep
Carry the dead
What's unsaid
Who's next in line now
It's raining overhead
There's bullets in your bed
You'll never get back home
The seeds already sown
It's what your kingdom has
A fence around his lies
This part you do alone
The seeds already sown
Already sown
It's raining overhead
There's bullets in your bag
You'll never get back home
The seed's already sown
It's what your king demands
The things around his lines
This part you do alone
The seeds already sown, already sown
