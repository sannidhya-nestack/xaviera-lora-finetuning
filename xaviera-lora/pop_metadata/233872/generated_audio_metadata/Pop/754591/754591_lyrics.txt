It's been four lovely hours since we've met
You've got my eye at the bar and we haven't left yet
The wine and the beer are speaking for me
I'm not sure if you got to know me at all
If you get to know me at all (If you get to know me at all)
If you get to know me at all
When the night is over
Though it feels like forever
And we're getting sober
Will we still be together?
Will we still be together?
She's like maybe we will
Let's have one more drink
Then we'll see what the night will bring
Next thing I know
XOXO
Suddenly I see my SOSO
Did you get to know me at all?
If you got you get to know me at all
When the night is over
Though it feels like forever
And we're getting sober
Will we still be together?
Will we still be together?
