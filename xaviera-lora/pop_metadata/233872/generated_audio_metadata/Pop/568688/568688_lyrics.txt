I'm lucky to feel this hole in my heart
Sensing it break brings me back to the start
We like to love strangers on wrong side of town
Hoping that we'll get each others back out
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Been there before
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Not anymore
Not anymore
I don't wanna hide it
I just wanna say yes I do
Can't see the light on
And know you're still there yes I do
We've been here before
Keeping it gentle and breaking it down
Try to be ready when good times around
But stronger than ever I'll give you my word
Your shining light always glows in my world (here we go now)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Been here before
Oh, not anymore, not anymore
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna say yes I do
Can't see the light on
I know you're still there yes I do
In the before
I won't resign myself to sinking into me
I won't disperse myself
It's time to set it free
I know it better now
We're two of a kind
I'll do it better, better in my class
Oh
I don't wanna hide it
I just wanna say yes I do
Can't see the light on
I know you're still there yes I do
Don't wanna hide it
I just wanna say yes I do
Can't see the light on
I know you're still there
