Fingers running through my head
You were always there
And I still feel your breath on my neck
Images too vivid to et
A frozen silhouette
Framed in our regret
We can laugh while we conquer the world
We can make it last
If I could hold you one more time (one more time)
What I would give
If we could just have one more night (one more night)
I can't live without you, baby, without you, baby
I don't wanna be here without you
It's still just like before you left
I haven't cleaned your mess
Now it's cold on your side of the bed
We could laugh while we conquered the world
We couldn't make it last
If I could hold you one more time (one more time)
What I would give
If we could just have one more night (one more night)
I can't live without you, baby, without you, baby
I don't wanna be here without you
Used to laugh while we conquered the world
I could hold you one more time
What I will give if we
Could just have one more night (one more night)
I can't live without you, baby, without you, baby
Without you, baby, without you, baby
I don't wanna be here without you
