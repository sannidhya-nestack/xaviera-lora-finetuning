I wanna feel that bass drop
I'm going in, I'm about that life
When the clock hit two, I'm ready to move
And you're just my type
Give me the night and I might take two
Under the lights, I wanna see you move
Half the bar, going down round two
And I got something to prove
Better hold your girl tight
When I'm on the scene and I'm lifted up
Started with a bottle and we mixed it up
Baby this is yo jam and we turned it up
Tomato 8's bumpin' we cuttin' it loose
Crackin' them cans and we breakin' them rules
Hell of a night that's a thing that we do
Livin' for one but we drinkin' for two (2) (2) (2) (2) (1) (1) (1) (1)
Like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like uh
Yeah, girl you crazy
And when I say crazy I think you're amazing
All your girlfriends bar hopping in
Shopping at Forever 21 but you were born in the 80's
Wanna come back to my place it's a castle
Actually that's all a lie
See I do what I can to get by so how do I spend this
My condo's kinda small but there's room for a princess
And I got friends girl you could bring like three friends
Make this after party last all weekend
Cameras teasing, sleeping eating
Take a lil nap after that repeating
Oh so fly
And if we fall in love, oh me, oh my
Together we could live long and love life
I don't love you yet, but I love you tonight, Mike Les
You know we go hard right in the scene
Falling in love then I'm breaking it clean
Breaking it clean if you know what I mean
I'm making it fun, I'm making a scene
Shorty look good, you know I might hit
Give her the night and take her off my list
Talk about a list, the kid make hits
Man I'm tryna keep ladies off of both my wrists like this
Get up
Get up, this for the girls and lot to get lit up
This is for the guys who are buying that liquor
Act like tonight you ain't throwing that, me and Chris
We don't make songs, we make hits
So this is a hit list for all of the bitches
Playing out, when they running they business
Can I get a witness?
Like this, like this, like, like, like, like, like, like this
This, like this, like this, like, like, like like, like, like, like this
This, like this, like this, like this, like, like, like, like, like this
