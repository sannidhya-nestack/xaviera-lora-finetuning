Could've given you the best of me
But I guess that I was holding back
Fell in love so young, so hopelessly
But you gave me time to deal with it
I guess I'll never get to know for sure
What would've happened if I let you in and gave you more
But honestly I'm happy that you found her
Maybe you two can get a ride
Looking at you through her eyes
Can't help but wonder if
She makes you dance to dumb songs like I did
Can't help but wonder if
She runs her fingers through your hair like I did
Can't help but see you too
Which is stupid why pick your fans
You're American dream nonsense
Can't help but wonder if
She fell in love with you like I did
Had enough time to move on from it
Then why do I still see you in my dreams
I finally pull tight and you let go of me
How do we get to lose everything
You didn't have to let it go that far
I don't even know who you are
I can't help but wonder if
She makes you dance to dumb songs like I did
Can't help but wonder if
She runs her fingers through your hair like I did
Can't help but see you too
We're just stupid white picket fence
You're American dream nonsense
Can't help but wonder if
She fell in love with you like I did
I did, yes I did
Fell in love with you, yes I did (I did)
Bet you'd remember it
Every little moment I did (I did)
I did (I did)
Yes, I did
I knew this would've happened, I did
But can't help but wonder if
She maybe should dance the dumb songs like I did
Can't help but wonder if
She runs her fingers through your hair like I did
Can't help but see the truth
She may love you now (she may love you now)
She may love you now (she may love you now)
She may love you now
But I did (I did)
She may love you now (she may love you now)
She may love you now (she may love you now)
She may love you now (I did, I did)
She may love you now (she may love you know)
She may love you now (she may love you know)
She may love you now (I did, I did)
She may love you now (she may love you)
