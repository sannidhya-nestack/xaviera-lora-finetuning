Somewhere along the way I found a place for me
Though I swear sometimes it seemed to take forever
Like those of us who brave stormy seas alone
I learned to take a little weather
And I say this is who I am I'm not afraid
To let you see and touch the very heart of me
The part of me that says I believe I gave my best
I'm giving you the very heart of me
Thinking back upon the darkest night of all
When it seemed the sun would never even find me
Right then a friend was what I needed most of all
That night I found one waiting there inside me
And I said
This is who I am, I'm not afraid
To let you see and touch the very heart of me
The part of me that says
I believe I gave my best
And I'm giving you the very heart of me
Ooh, so when my days are done
And I've had my fun
I'd like to say
I wouldn't trade my life with anyone
I gave it all
I had to give, ooh, yeah
This is who I am, I'm not afraid
To let you see and touch the very heart of me
The part of me that says
I believe I gave my best
I'm giving you the very heart of me
I'm giving you
The very heart of me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
