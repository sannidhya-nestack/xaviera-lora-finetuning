Bright lights shining everywhere
We were on the dare
Meeting eyes without a care
Feeling love, fair and square
Running through the city streets
Dancing to the beats
Hand in hand our hearts compete
Life and love, fair and square
Fair and square
Fair and square
You and me
As wild as we can be
Fair and square
Can't you see
We're bounded eternally
Underneath the starry sky
Dreams are up so high, holding tight and never shy
You and I, fair and square
Every moment feels so right
In the day and night
No regrets, no need to fight
In this glow, fair and square
Fair and square
You and me
As wild as we can be
Fair and square
Can't you see
We're bounded eternally
Every moment feels so right
In the day and night
No regrets, no need to fight
In this glow, fair and square
Fair and square
You and me
As wild as we can be
Fair and square
Can't you see
We're bounded eternally
