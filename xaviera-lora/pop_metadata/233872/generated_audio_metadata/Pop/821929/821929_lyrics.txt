Da, da, da, da, da, da, da (hey)
You didn't know,'cause you didn't want to
Those things I thought were true
And all I kept was the hardwood stain that your baggage left
I'm free, eee, of your insecurities
Are you, are you?
I am falling up and you can't bring me down
I still hear your voice calling me somehow
Way up here there's one last thing I need
I'm calling all the cars to bring you back to me
I'm free from your gravity
You breathe, can't feel your breath, freeze, stop here
I am falling up and you can't bring me down
I still hear your voice calling me somehow
Way up here there's one last thing I need
And I'm calling all the cars to bring you back to me
Falling up and you can't bring me down
Hear your voice calling me somehow
Wait up here, there's one last thing I need (hey)
I'm calling all the cars to bring you back
I got the letter that you left on my doorstep
Bringing you back from a past tense
Take back the watches that you bought
When I said I needed more time not more bucks
I needed space to breathe
I never meant for you to leave
I am falling up and you can't bring me down
I still hear your voice calling me somehow
Way up here there's one last thing I need
And I'm calling all the cars to bring you back to me
Falling up and you can't bring me down
I still hear your voice calling me somehow
Way up here there's one last thing I need
I'm calling all the cars to bring you back to me
