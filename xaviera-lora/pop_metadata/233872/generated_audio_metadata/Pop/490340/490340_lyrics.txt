Say you will, say you will
Say you will, say you will
Say you'll always be mine
I can feel it all around
I can feel it touching me inside
I can feel your body move
Just like the first time I met you
Can you feel it coming down? (coming down)
Can you feel me coming after you?
Can you hear me calling out? (calling out)
Just like the time
Say you will, say you will
Say you'll be my love tonight
Say you will, say you will
Say you'll always be mine
Say you will, say you will
Say you'll love me one more time
Say you will, say you will
Say you'll always be mine
I just wanna hold you now
I just wanna hold you close to me
I will never let you go
Just like the first time when I met you
There will be nobody else
There will be nobody else but you
There will never be alone
Just like the time when I met you
Say you will, say you will
Say you'll love me one more time
Say you will, say you will
Say you'll always be mine
Say you will, say you will
Say you'll be my love tonight
Say you will, say you will
Say you'll always be mine
Do you love me one more time?
Call me now (think we the same way now)
Be alone (think we the same way now)
So you'll always be mine
Say you will, say you will
Say you'll be my love tonight
Say you will, say you will
Say you'll always be mine
Say you will, say you will
Say you'll love me one more time
Say you will, say you will
Say you'll always be mine
