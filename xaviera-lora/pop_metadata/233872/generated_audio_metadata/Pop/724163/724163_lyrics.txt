You say, there's nothing like living in the summer sun
There's nothing like leaving when the winter comes
There's nothing like feeling the rains
Okay, you feel, there's nothing like a little bit of sex appeal
Just the look in their eyes and it feels so real yeah
There's nothing in the sky but blue all day
Now the world's always spinning and the seas will keep on winning anytime I was feeling
Yeah it's so revealing contemplating on a moment that makes you wanna float away
Although your life's a bit of flood
A step away from all the clutter
Walking out into the future like a passenger commuter
Talking, taking yourself into another day
This way you see
You had a way you can see
In reality it seems so unreal
To ever show it's plain
On today
You know
There's nothing like being in the start of the show
Ain't nothing like having the right to grow
There's nothing like driving away
Okay
So the world is a turning and the time keeps a burning and your train is a running
As your friends go and come and custom making yourself so underplayed
A lemonade now you're cooler till I'm eight to be the ruler fucker up you're still a looker
Activate the pressure cook activating yourself another state
And all the worlds I've been spinning in the season keep on winning in the time I've been stealing
Yet it's only feeling contemplating on a moment that makes you want to float away
Although your life's a bit of a step away from all the good of walking out into the future
Like a passenger commuter talking to himself into another day
This way, okay
