Every time I see your face
Heartbeats start to race
Tiny sparks in the night
Shining moments feel so right
Whispered words in the dark
They light a little spark
Holding hands under stars
No matter where we are
Sweet something's in my ear
You make my world so clear
Sweet something's hold me tight
You're my glowing light
Morning coffee side by side
Love worth nowhere to hide
Gentle touch feels so pure
In your arms I feel secure
Together we found the key
Love's sweet symphony
With you here by my side
Our spirits collide
Sweet somethings in my ear
You make my world so clear
Sweet somethings hold me tight
You're my glowing light
Together we found the key
Love's sweet symphony
With you here by my side
Our spirits collide
Sweet song of things in my ear
You make my world so clear
Sweet song that holds me tight
You're my glowing light
