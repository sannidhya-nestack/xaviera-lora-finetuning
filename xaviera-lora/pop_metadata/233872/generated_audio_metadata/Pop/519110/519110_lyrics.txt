Girl, you walked right into my life
It was darker than you were my light
And right away, a brighter day it came
Now, you're ripping my heart out
I died when you walked out
Walked out the door, I need you more
And girl I just can't be without you
Can't breathe without you
Can't see without you
Girl, I just can't breathe without you, baby (oh, my love)
I can't live without you (without you)
I can't breathe without you (without you)
I can't see without you (without you)
Oh, my love, I can't live without you
Without you (without you)
I can't breathe without you (without you)
I can't see without you (without you)
What am I supposed to do, baby?
I'm flipping out, I'm going crazy
I don't know what to do
What do I do?
I cannot go without you baby
You are my one and only lady
I won't find no one
No one like you
And girl I just can't be without you
Can't breathe without you
Can't see without you
Girl I just can't breathe without you baby
Oh my love
I can't live without you (without you)
I can't breathe without you (without you)
I can't see without you (without you)
All my life, I was searching for you, and now you're gone, what do, what do I do?
Oh my love, I can't live without you (without you)
I can't breathe without you (without you)
I can't see without you (I can't breathe without you)
Oh my love, I can't live without you
I can't breathe without you (without you, my love)
I can't see without you (I can't live without you, baby)
Oh my love
I can't live without you, I can't breathe without you
I can't see without you, oh my love
I can't live without you, I can't breath without you
I can't see without you, oh my love
I can't live without you, I can't breath without you
I can't see without you, oh my love
Without you (oh baby)
I can't breathe without you
I can't see without you
Oh my love
I can't live without you
I can't breathe without you
I can't see without you
