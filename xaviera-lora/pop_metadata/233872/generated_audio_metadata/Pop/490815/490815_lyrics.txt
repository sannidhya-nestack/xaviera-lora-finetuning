I felt that I knew you the minute I set my eyes on you
I saw that you knew me
The moment you looked across the room
It was the day that I met you
I can recall the sky was blue
It was the day that I found you
How did you know my heart was true
Heaven's above
And here in my heart
And this is love
You're deep in my heart
You're deep in my heart
Walk up and down all over this town
Figuring out what's bringing you down
If you were here I'd probably say
Nothing to lose, let's play all the way
Heaven's above
And here in my heart
And this is love
You're deep in my heart
Deep in my heart
You're deep in my heart
It was the day that I found you
How did you know my heart was true?
Heaven's above
And here in my heart
Damn this is love
You're deep in my heart
You're deep in my heart
You're deep in my heart
