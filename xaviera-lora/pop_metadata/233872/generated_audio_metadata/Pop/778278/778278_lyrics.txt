I know we don't have much time
But I think it's just enough
If you'd like to take a chance on me
Let's go, let's go
If you'd like to take a chance on me
Let's go, let's go
You keep on keeping me on and on, on and on, on and on
You keep on keeping me on and on, on and on, on and on
You keep on keeping me on and on, on, on and on
I know we don't have much time
But I think it's just enough
If you'd like to take a chance on me
Let's go, let's go
If you'd like to take a chance on me
Let's go, let's go
If you'd like to take a chance on me
Let's go, let's go
If you'd like to take a chance on me
Let's go, let's go
I know we don't have much time
But I think it's just enough
I know we don't have much time
But I think it's just enough
I know we don't have much time
But I think it's just enough
If you'd like to take a chance on me
Let's go, let's go
If you'd like to take a chance on me
Let's go, let's go
I know we don't have much time, but I think it's just enough
If you'd like to take a chance on me
Let's go, let's go
If you'd like to take a chance on me
Let's go, let's go
