Silver paint
Shrouded in a mask of mist
Remember when we kissed
Along the ocean side
How are we to know
Love would ebb and flow
Just like the fickle tide
Days gone by and though I still think of her
God only knows for sure
Where all our bad guns go
Yet my memory is a foggy sea
Where tides of teardrops flow
Come what may I believe in love
Because it's a mystery to me
Love gives breath to the history that was
And the history to be
Oh silver play, where we danced along the shore
But different steps soon tore our futures at the seams
Yesterday is gone, yet our kiss lives on
In misty midnight dreams
Of Silver Bay
Silver Bay
Silver
