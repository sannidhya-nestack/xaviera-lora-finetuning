Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, love, love, love, love was not enough
My love, love, my love, love wasn't enough, not enough, not enough
My love, my loves are not enough, not enough
You led me to believe I stood a chance with you in the summertime
I should've known that you'd deceive and that you lied
Your heart was never mine
A northern boy wouldn't suit a southern girl
He can't handle the salt in the air
He should've grown tolerance
For the slower pace
But he's a weaker man in this case
my love, my love, my love, my love wasn't enough, enough, enough, enough
My love, my love's not enough, not enough
My heart was set on you
But you could never choose which girl to lose
I should've known that way back then
We should've stayed just friends to have a better end
You're young in heart
You're not wise in mind
You think that he's the only one that you'll find
'Cause you believe his lies
You're looking in his eyes
And he leaves you asking why
Was my love, love, love, love
Wasn't enough, not enough, not enough
My love, my loves are not enough, not enough
My love, love, love, love, love wasn't enough, enough, enough
My love, my loves are not enough, not enough
My love, love, love, love, love was in a knot, a knot, a knot, a knot, a knot
My love, my love's not enough, not enough
My love, love, love, love wasn't enough, not enough
My love, my love's not enough, not enough
Love, not enough, not enough
Love, not enough
