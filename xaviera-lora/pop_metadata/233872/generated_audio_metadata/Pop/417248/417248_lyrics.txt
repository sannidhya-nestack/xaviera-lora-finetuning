Well you think I can't get by
Well I do, I do
We both stood face to face
Said I do, and I did
It's a long dark road
We travel down from where we used to be
I've found that's not the way
That love was meant to be
Well I thought that I could trust you and I did, yes I did
Guess you played me for the fool and you did, yes you did
All that I once gave to you is killing me inside
That's not the kind of love to last through all of time
I will try every road that one day may take me
To wherever he may be
Till I feel in my heart it's true
I'll keep asking if this is you
If it's you it will be
How love was meant to be
Well, I dreamt of love forever
And I did, and I do
For the worst and for the better
I did, and I do
There's one dream in life
I've waited for, that's what you were to me
I've learned that's not the way that love was meant to be
I will try
Every road that one day may take me
To wherever he may be
Till I feel in my heart it's true
I'll keep asking if this is you
If it's you it will be
How love was meant to be
The strength that I have counted on has never come from you
You don't think I have the faith inside, I do
I must go on now, knowing somewhere, somehow
Oh, I will try
Every road that one day may take me
To wherever he may be
Till I feel in my heart it's true
I'll keep asking if this is you
If it's you, it will be
How love was meant to be
It will be how love was meant to be
