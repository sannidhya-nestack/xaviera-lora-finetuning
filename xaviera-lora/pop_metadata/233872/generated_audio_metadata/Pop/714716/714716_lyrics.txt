I used to think that life was just a fairy tale
I used to think that all my dreams would come true
And so I tried and tried to run away from home
But now I know that there's no place for me to go
But home, I'm back home, yeah
I'm not alright but I'll be okay
If you see things my way
It's hard to fight
It's hard to say
That I'm not alright
But I'll be okay
I'll be okay
It used to be that all my friends would shut me out
I tried to speak but everyone was so consumed
And then you came along to show me the way out
But I did not know that I would end up here alone
Oh no, oh no
No, I'm not alright, but I'll be okay
If you see things my way
It's hard to fight, it's hard to say
That I'm not alright, but I'll be okay
I'll be okay
How could you leave me here all alone
Knowing the whole of my spirit was broke
Yesterday we were alive
And now you say our passion has died
How could you leave me here all alone
After you gave me that ring to hold
You say you don't want me to cry
Now you have to go off on your own
I used to think that life would be a fairy tale
Now I just need to take some time to love myself
And I don't have to run away from home no more, no more
Because I've learned that it's okay to be alone
And I'm home, I'm home
Yeah, I'm not alright, but I'll be okay
Though you don't see things my way
It's hard to fight, it's hard to say
That I'm not alright, but I'll be okay
I'll be okay, I'll be okay, it's gonna be okay
