I'm gonna make you never wanna be with any other but me
Tell me what's it gonna take to make you satisfied with me
I'm gonna be the one that's gonna make you see
Baby, it's as easy as a one, two, three
You looked around but never found
The kind of love that really got your groove on
But you can't deny the chemistry
The special thing that you're missing when your heart's gone
You should've said what you meant if you never would've
All you gotta do is take it back and we can start again from yesterday (I know that you never wanna be with anyone but me, so what's it gonna take to make you satisfied? I know that the world is gonna make you see)
Baby, it's as easy as one, two, three
You know I'm home, I am alone
Pick up the phone and baby put the moves on
Just let it go, I wanna know
I want to feel when you're feeling my emotion
You should've said what you meant
And I never would've been this way
All you gotta do is take it back
And we can start again from yesterday (I'm waiting for you)
I wanna be with anyone but me
So what's it gonna take to make you satisfy me?
I'm gonna be the one that's gonna make you see
Make you see, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna make you never wanna be with anyone but me
So what's it gonna take to make you satisfy me?
I'm gonna be the one that's gonna make you see
Baby, it's as easy as a one, two, three
I don't give up, I keep it real
I'm a lady on a mission and I don't feel
No sympathy, no broken heart
You had your chance, now you're wishing for a new start
You should've said what you meant
And it never would've been this way
All you gotta do is take it back
And we can start again from yesterday
Tell me what you're gonna do
Yeah, yeah, eh, eh, eh (So what's it gonna take?)
Alright (So what's it gonna take?)
She knows we on the deep end (So what's it gonna take?)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm gonna make you never wanna be with anyone but me
So what's it gonna take to make you satisfy me?
I'm gonna be the one that's gonna make you see
Baby it's as easy as one, two
I'm gonna make you never wanna be with anyone but me
So what's it gonna take to make you satisfy me?
I'm gonna be the one that's gonna make you see
Baby, it's as easy as a one, two
I'm gonna make you never wanna be with any other but me
Tell me what's it gonna take to make you satisfy me
I'm gonna be the one that's gonna make you see
Baby, it's as easy as a one, two, three
