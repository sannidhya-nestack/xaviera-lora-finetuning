When it started out it was nothing at all
You were kinda startling, angled and withdrawn
Looking for a map of the world or a song, I don't know
Suddenly I'm losing my head in a rush
Everything is highly defined and I'm
You can see me running alone in the street, will you know?
I can see the bright lights glowing
The alarm stops going and I think I'm in a terrible state
That we're all dying anyway
Even if it kills me
Even if I don't recover
I would rather be killed by a lover
I can see the bright lights
Something isn't working, I can't find the words
Summertime adrenaline left me an afterburn
Looking for a map of the world or a song, I don't know
Swimming in and out of a chemical sleep
Double double triangle drown in my bed sheets
You can see me running alone in the street, will you know?
I can see the bright lights glowing
The alarm stops going
And I think I made a terrible mistake
That we're all dying anyway
Even if it kills me
Even if I don't recover
I would rather be killed by a lover
I can see the bright lights
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Someday when you see me, I'll be remote controlled
Call my name, I'll wave and say hello
I can see the bright lights glowing, the alarm stops going
And I think I made a terrible mistake
But we're all dying anyway
Even if it kills me
Even if I don't recover
I would rather be killed by a lover
I can see the bright lights
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
