Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Would you hang with us? It's 9pm, it's time to jam
There's a raging twitter buzz, what you waiting for?
Come crazy, freakin' hot, go peek and dance until we soar
We're infected by this body rockin' beat that's dropping hard on us (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
We're injected with this ginseng pumpin' groove that's dumping so uncaught
We're a fever, no remedy for us
No vaccine, dancing is our drug
We're a virus, no antidote for us
Like caffeine, we're gonna spread this rug
We're gonna smash the floor
We'll rock it to the core
We'll make the speakers roar
This club has come to war
This club has come to war (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
This club has come to war (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Party crashing feeling gangster gonna run this show
We're out to score
We're glamorous and dangerous
We're dancing'til the bone
We're infected by this body rocking beat that's dropping hot on us
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're injected with this ginseng pumping groove that's dumping so uncut
We're a fever, no remedy for us
No vaccine, dancing is our drug
We're a virus, no antidote for us
Like caffeine, we're gonna spread this ruse
We're gonna smash the floor
We'll rock it to the core
We'll make the speakers roar
This club is gone to war
This club is gone to war (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
This club is gone to war (Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
This club is gone to war
Yes, the sickest feet around
This club has gone to war
No surrender in this town
This club has gone to war
Till they shut the power down
We're gonna smash the clock, we're rocking to the clock
You'll make us do this right, let's go, let's go to war
This love has come to war (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
This love has come to war (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
This love has come to war
