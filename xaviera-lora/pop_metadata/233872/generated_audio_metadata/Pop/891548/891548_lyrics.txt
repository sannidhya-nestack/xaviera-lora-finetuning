A DVD of Pinocchio
A green T-shirt from Tokyo
Too many souvenirs
I got from you through several years
The TV from our living room
A scarf with some remains of your perfume
A picture where I used to see
The future of a family
Oh, but somehow, somehow
Things didn't turn out the way it should, oh
Somehow, somehow
This is all I've got
They say that I should throw you away
this is where it stops
But I'm putting you away now in a cardboard box
The most important thing I'll take
Is knowledge that may one day cure this ache
Though you will never give me something new
I did enjoy being good to you, oh
But somehow, somehow
Things didn't turn out the way it should, oh
Somehow, somehow
This is all I've got
They say that I should throw you away
this is where it stops
But I'm putting you away now in a cardboard box
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Somehow, somehow
Things didn't turn out the way it should've
Somehow, somehow
This is all I've got
They say that I should throw you away
Cause this is where it stops
But I'm putting you away now in a cardboard box
Though things will never be the same
I keep a little box with your name
