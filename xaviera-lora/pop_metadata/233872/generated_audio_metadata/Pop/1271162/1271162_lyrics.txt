Do I make you mine?
Do you feel denied?
Did I win this time?
I'm not surprised
That you test the size of what I
Left behind
No, I won't come down
it wore me out
So wear your crown
Are you happy now?
No I won't come down
Cause it won't be long
So wear your crown
Are you happy now?
Oh, you shut up
It's not too cute that you keep copying me
You're living out of spite of who you're trying to be like
There's something you should know
I'm better than before
Oh, you should know
You're taking over me
You're who I used to be
That's how you used to keep
I'm hot in the body
You're taking over me
You're who I used to be
That's how you want to keep
How how to party
How how to party
I'm outta, power, power, power, power, power, power
You're taking over me
You're who I used to be
That's how you used to keep
Our modern body
You're taking over me
You're who I used to be
Now that's how you're supposed to keep
How how to party
How how to party
