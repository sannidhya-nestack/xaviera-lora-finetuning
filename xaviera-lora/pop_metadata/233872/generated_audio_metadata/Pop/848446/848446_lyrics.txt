Backseat filled, hand upon the wheel
Northbound drive, I nevermore lie
More life
Late night trips to Walmart
Ride them kids skateboards in aisles
We were strange
In the fast way
With my ADD bestie
Now don't you et me
The beauty of crazy comes out
You make me wanna
Shout, it's so easy to let it out
And it's okay for me to be me
you make it all out, you make me
Shout, you're my anchor without a doubt
And there's just some people that you can't deal without
So come and make me shout
So come and make me shout
So come and make me girls night and I'm the day
We watch the stupidest movie ever made
We laugh at days and jokes about boys that were never meant
Just stupid boys, three musketeers
It's all I need right here with my maggles
You're tangled from starlight
You just might let beautiful crazy come out
You make me wanna show
It's so easy to let it out and it's okay for me to be me
you make it out loud, you make me shout
You're my anchor without a doubt
And there's just so many people that you can't do without
So come and make me shout
So come make me shout
You make me wanna shout like I've never done before
I just wanna shout, ooh, ooh, ooh, woah, yeah
You make me wanna shout
It's so easy to let it out
And it's okay for me to be me
you make it allowed
You make me shout
You're my anchor without a doubt
And there's just some people that you can't do without
So come and make me shout
So come and make me shout
So come and make me shout
So come and make me shout
Let the beauty of crazy come out
