We don't have anything
No place to call home
Holding a memory
Of when we were young
We keep driving'til we hit the coastline
Reckless luck and a feeling that won't hide
Light it up in the backseat curbside
Windows down as we go to the daylight
And I just need your love
And I don't need no money
We don't need tomorrow
And I just need your love
And I just need your love
And I don't need no money
We don't need tomorrow
And I just need your love
I don't need anything
Here we could just run
Lost in the interstate
Yeah, we could just get away, ay
We keep driving'til we hit the coastline
Reckless luck and a feeling that won't hide
Light it up in the backseat curbside
Windows down as we go to the daylight
And I just need your love
And I don't need no money
We don't need tomorrow
And I just need your love
And I just need your love
And I don't need no money
We don't need tomorrow
And I just need your love
Ooh, yeah
We keep on keep on driving don't need no money nothing
Long as I got you with me I won't be looking back
We keep on keep on driving don't need no money nothing
Long as I got you with me I won't be looking back
