Ain't it funny how it all becomes clear
Sometimes it happens you can see the snow is falling
And then I slip into my cloudy day dream
And I don't have control'cause you got a hold on me
And now I'm spending all my thinking time
Don't wanna go back to my day to day
A hush has fallen now the curtain opens up a scene
And you're my beautiful distraction
I can picture you in my mind
Just need to sit there while the music's playing in my eyes
No rhyme or reason, it can come at any time
I hope I've got enough to keep you by my side
And now I'm spending all my thinking time
I don't wanna go back to my day to day
A hush has fallen now the curtain opens up a seam
And you're my beautiful distraction
My beautiful distraction
Ain't it funny how it all becomes clear
Sometimes it happens you can see the snow is falling
And then I slip into my cloudy day dream
And I don't have control
Because you got a hold on me
And now I'm spending all my thinking time
Don't wanna go back to my day to day
A hush has fallen like a curtain opens up a scene
And you're my beautiful distraction
My beautiful distraction
You're beautiful
