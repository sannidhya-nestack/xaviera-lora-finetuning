I just remember every day of our life
And always my memories dear
Are all over here
And if that's all your heart
You left me long
To say goodbye, oh don't you make me cry
Even if there's no more time
Only you can save my soul
I paint your face in my heart
Still, do you feel your arms around me?
Are you above me?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I just remember every day of our life
And always my memories dear
Our love will heal
And if that's all your heart
You'll love me long
Please say goodbye and don't you make me cry
Even if there's no more time
Only you can save my soul
I paint your face in my heart
Still, do you feel your arms around me?
Are you above me?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
