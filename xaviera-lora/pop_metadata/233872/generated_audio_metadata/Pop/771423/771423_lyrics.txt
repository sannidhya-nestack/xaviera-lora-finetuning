It hit me like a hurricane
And now you're in the fast lane
You know it's never been the same
Since the day you went gone
And baby I'll wait for you
I've been there for you so I'll be there for you
Used to love it when we danced like that
The way that you move you got me feeling like that
So give me a chance and I will take you back
So we can move on and on and on
Used to love it when we danced like that
The way that you move you got me feeling like that
So give me a chance and I will take you back
So we can move on and on and on
So come on baby here's the plan
You're gonna find another man
When you remember my name we'll go back to the days
L .O .V .E doesn't mean a thing without you
And baby I'll wait for you
I've been there for you so I'll be there for you
Used to love it when we danced like that
The way that you move you got me feeling like that
Give me a chance and I will take you back
So we can move on and on and on
Used to love it when we danced like that
The way that you move you got me feeling like that
Give me a chance and I will take you back
So we can move on and on and on
Maybe we can run away
Maybe in another life
Maybe we can fly away
But only if you hold me tight
Used to love it when we danced like that
The way that you move you got me feeling like that
Give me a chance and I will take you back
So we can move on and on and on
Used to love it when we danced like that
The way that you move you got me feeling like that
Give me a chance and I will take you back
So we can move on and on and on
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on
