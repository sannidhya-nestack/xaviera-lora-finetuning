Oh, you're such a find
So electrical, so impeccable
You're one of a kind
So collectible, so delectable
I'm so glad that you're mine
I'm having the time of my life
Please don't go away
You're so missable, you're so kissable
Hey, I'm here to stay
This is serious, I'm delirious
Baby, what can I say?
Come out and play
I do love you, I do
And I know this time this love of mine is true
Oh please say you do too
Cause I do love you I do
Hear those trumpets sound
Such a melody
Something's telling me you must be around
Such intensity
Every sense in me says hey look what I found
Don't let me down
I do love you
I do
And I know this time this love of mine is true
Oh so true
Oh please say you do too
Cause I do love you I do
Cause I do love you I do
'Cause I do love you, I do
