You took the light off everyone
Remember when
You swallowed the sun
Ooh, what a way
To waste the day
Do you remember when we were young
The antispirity was there every once
Do you remember when we were young
A team spirit, it always won
Nostalgia is my radio, a winter's war
Bereaved by summer sun
Who would wait to waste the day?
Let's waste the days
Do you remember when we were young?
Seeing spirit within every once
Fears, fears, fears, fears
Go tell the wolves that you're here
Go tell them you're deepest darkest
Fierce, tell them your fire is gone
Fierce, tell them you're tired, they've won
Fierce, do you remember when we were young?
The empty spirit it was there every once
Do you remember when we
When we were young
I see your spirits
You're always one
I see your spirits
Always one
