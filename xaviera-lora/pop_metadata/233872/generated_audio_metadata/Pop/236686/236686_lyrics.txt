I hate horrible (I hate horrible)
I love beautiful
And I will let you know
Beauty covers from head to toe
Shining everywhere you may go
Shining in my hair
Shining everywhere
Shining in the sky
Shining at the birds that fly
Shining from the sun
Shining to everyone
The little, the little star that shines
Shining in my hair
Shining everywhere
Shining in the sky, shining oh so high, shining from the sun, shining to everyone
I'm going to try and get it out of here.
Peaking autumn colors (peaking autumn colors)
And cold white winters
Into blooming spring flowers
With rain falling down
Now everything has changed (has changed)
Summer has come
The seasons have gone around
Shining in the air (shining in the air)
Shining everywhere (shining everywhere)
Shining in the sky (shining in the sky)
Shining at the bands of light (shining at the bands of light)
Shining for the sun (the sun)
Shining to everywhere
Feel it, you'll notice that it's shining in my hair
Shining everywhere, shining in the sky
Shining oh so high, shining from the sun
It's shining everywhere
Shining in my hair
Shining everywhere
Shining symbols so high
Shining symbols so high
Too real too real
