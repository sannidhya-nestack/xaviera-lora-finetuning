Cut my wings and drowned me
I'm so sorry you found me
Why can't you tell me I'm beautiful?
This is an endless story
Just one that fell before me
Our love is lost and I can't et
The pain that you put me through
The way that you said you knew
That we would always be one
I try to run from the truth
But I'm addicted to you
And I just can't go on
If I fight, I fall
My world seems so small
And now I'm stuck with only memories
Right now I walk alone, no one to call my own
My heart feels so broken, so broken, so broken, so broken
Every time I try to move on
I come back and then you're gone
And I get stuck along this road
I'm moving slow
Last night was so tough I
Had to sleep without you
I've been loving you for so long
Every thought in my head's about you
Our love is more than a lie
You're always on my mind but when are you gonna realize
That every time I try I get left behind
I must slip your mind every feeling I find is broken because
If I fight I fall my world seems so small
And now I'm stuck with only memories
Right now I walk alone, no one to call my own
My heart feels so broken, so broken, so broken, so broken
This love's got me so broken
Heart fell with no emotion
I thought you loved me for who I was
You held me in your arms
Every moment was ours
If I could I would take it all back because
If I fight, I fall
My world seems so small
And now I'm stuck with only memories
Right now I walk alone
No one to call my own
My heart feels
So broken, so broken, so broken, so broken
