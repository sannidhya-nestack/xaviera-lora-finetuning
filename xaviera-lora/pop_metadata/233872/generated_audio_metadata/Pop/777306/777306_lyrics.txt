Lost and roaming, like a stray into the night
Can't you see my strength is crumbling?
Shake me until I wake up
Stop me drowning in self-doubt
Take me to a lake of fire
Where I can wash
Oh wait, gotta get myself a little anarchy
A little time away from myself and me
Your love is battery acid and heavy on water
What happens now to daddy's little girl?
You're in my head, turning over what was said
Thought I'd handle this way
You see through me like water
I'm out of time with everyone
As far as I can tell
Burning my end to a steady beat that aches
The fields have grown bigger
But I still stand tall
Shiver in the shadow of you
Unspoken words choke on the air
Surrounding me in claustrophobia
Oh, oh, anomalous
It's at the stage where you really don't care
Do you?
You're in my head, turning over what was said
Know how to handle this whale
You see through me like water, don't buy time with everyone
As far as I can tell
You're in my head, turning over what was said
Know how to handle this whale
Tell me why
Tell me why
I can't please you, can't please myself
I can't please you, can't please myself
I can't please you and I can't please nobody else
No, no, no, nobody else
No, no, no, nobody else
No, no, no, nobody else
