I saw his face on a billboard
I took his place for a little while
But you said I don't have the drive
I can't replace a better man
I cannot give you all he can
And you said I don't have the life
'Cause I live on a tightrope
In a house made out of string
I can't give you anything
I sleep in between the lines
Trying to keep up the lie
That I'm anything more than a fool for you
I'm a fool for you
Tangled in dizzy streets
I'm a fool for you
And I don't care if it matters
I'm a fool for you
Lost in between the sheets
I'm a fool for you
Now nothing really matters
I saw his face on the boulevard
And for a while I saw my own
Made it look so very easy
I was too tired, too cold
Look too young, feel too old
Feel too small to ever be more
'Cause I live on a tightrope
In a house made out of string
I can't give you anything
I sleep in between the lines
Trying to keep up the lie
That I'm nothing more than a fool for you
For you
Tangled in dizzy streets
I'm a fool for you
And I don't care if it matters
I'm a fool for you
Lost in between sheets
I'm a fool for you
Now nothing really matters anymore
Anymore, anymore
