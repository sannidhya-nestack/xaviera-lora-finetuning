If only I could fly
Touch the sky so high
Break the chains tonight
Feel the world so bright
If only dreams came true
Every wish so new
I'd dance the whole night through
Chasing stars with you
If only
If only
You were right here today
I'd hold you, I'd hold you together mostly
If only time would stop up to the mountain top
With you I'd run non-stop no need for a clock
If only we were free like waves in the sea
Together you and me forever we would be
If only, if only you were right here today
I'd hold you, I'd hold you together mostly
If only dreams came true
Every wish so new
I'd dance the whole night through
Chasing stars with you
If only, if only
You were right here today
I'd hold you, I'd hold you
Together mostly
