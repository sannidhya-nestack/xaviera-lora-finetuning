I was drifting out at sea when you took a hold of me
Pulled me onto solid ground
Looking up into your face my heart began to race
Love would never let me drown
I could breathe you in, never give you up
Be my oxygen, alive in your love
Ever since I've been with you
Days are bright, skies are blue
Feel the sweetness everywhere
Every night you hold me close
Giving me another dose of what I need to live
More than air
I could breathe you in, never give you up
Be my oxygen, alive in your love
Alive in your love
When life says no, love says yes
And I will always do my best
To make you laugh and smile that smile
The one that makes me lose my breath
I could breathe you in
Never give you up
Be my oxygen alive in your love
Alive in your love
Never give you up
Alive in your love
Be my oxygen
Alive in your love
Alive in your love
Alive in your love
