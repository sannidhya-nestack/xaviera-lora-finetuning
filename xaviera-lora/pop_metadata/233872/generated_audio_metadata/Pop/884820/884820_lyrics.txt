An addictive existence never ending
Will come and go
Can you tell your price for independence
Come on, come on, tell me more, amor
Tell me what you think about it, sweetie
All milk for love
La vie n'est pas du bouffon cinéma mais
En général je n'ai pas de réponse
If one day the sun is down and out
And the mountains crumble
When one day the sun is down and out
And the wind blows
And then you will arise, and then you will surprise
Fly the boat, high and low
Une existence qui vole
Is not a cup of tea
It's our reality
And we are dancing
In the rays
Now's on the hunt for exoplanets
We hunt for use
We are stars
We are slowly dying
In the center of the Milky Way
Breeders that are stoned away to freedom
Come back alive
Predicted existence is a bubble
C'est une peur qui danse dans la région
If one day the sun is down and out
And the mountains crumble
When one day the sun is down and out
And we'll, and we'll
And then we'll arise
And then we'll surprise
Flying above high and low
Une existence qui vole
It's not a cup of tea
It's our reality and we are dancing in the rays (and we are dancing, dancing) (and we are dancing, dancing) in the rays (dancing, dancing)
