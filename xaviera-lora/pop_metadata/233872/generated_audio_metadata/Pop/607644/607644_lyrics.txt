Survive, survive, survive
Alive, alive, alive
Amidst rotten and rust and leaves and dust
Your grace and your haunting while you laugh
Your belly is burning with your beast and your spear
Your darkening fear invites these thoughts with their songs
With their songs
Yeah, yeah
I don't quite know
What it is I see, yeah
Man, you look different
You've got some strange, strange, strange energy
We are old film props from cowboy towns
So convincing but fragile and thin
You stand so tall with your shoulders pulled back
You are so well composed
My dear old friend, won't you ive me?
I did not know with your beast and your spear
Your darkening fear invites these thoughts with their souls
I don't quite know
What it is I see, yeah, man, you look different
You've got some strange, strange, strange energy
Deep down, down, down into your sea
Deep down, down, down
Into your sea
Survive, survive, survive
Alive, alive, alive
Survive
Survive, survive
With your beast and your spear
Your darkening fear
Invites these thoughts
With their songs
With their songs
Yeah, yeah, I don't quite know what it is I see
Man, you look different
You've got some strange, strange, strange energy
