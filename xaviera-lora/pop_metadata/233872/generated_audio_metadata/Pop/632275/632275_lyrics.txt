Tonight
Tonight
I don't know, I don't care
I feel us touching the air tonight
We were one, we are two
I see us touching the stars
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't know, I don't care
I feel us touching the air tonight
We were one, we are two
I see us touching the stars
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight
