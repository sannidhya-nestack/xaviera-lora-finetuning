Silence slips into my world
And it follows into my dreams
Moonbeams
Flicker across my room
And in the twilight
Your thoughts will be broken
And when the sun goes down
A shadow is cast on this town
And when the sun goes down
The night breaks free
Your dreams echo my mind's eye
In this daylight painting the sky
The sun comes
Crossing the water
We're breathing sunlight
And resting our eyes
And when the sun goes down
A shadow is cast on this town
And when the sun goes down
The night breaks free
