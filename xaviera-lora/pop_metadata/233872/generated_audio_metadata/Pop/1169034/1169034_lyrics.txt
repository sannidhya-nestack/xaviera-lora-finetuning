Looking back on a million memories made
Can't help but smile at how beautiful yesterday's
Not even time could take that away
Who knows where this road will lead
But as long as you're here with me
I'm gonna face it
I'm gonna make it
Knowing you'll be there too
I can hold on longer
I know I'm stronger
Stronger because of you
Stronger because of you
Should my sky fall
You'll pick me up again
There's no forever
You won't be welcome in
Wherever I go
Wherever I've been
Who knows where this road will lead
But as long as you're here with me
I'm gonna face it, I'm gonna make it
Know when you'll be there too
I can hold on longer
I know I'm stronger, stronger because of the laughter and the tears
Through the trials and the years
Through the heartbreaks we've endured
Love lives on forevermore
Who knows where this road will lead
But as long as you're here with me
I'm gonna face it
I'm gonna make it
Know when you'll be there too
Knows where this road will lead
But as long as you're here with me
I'm gonna face it
I'm gonna make it
Know when you'll be there too
I can hold on longer
I know I'm stronger
Stronger because of you
Stronger because of you
Stronger because of you
