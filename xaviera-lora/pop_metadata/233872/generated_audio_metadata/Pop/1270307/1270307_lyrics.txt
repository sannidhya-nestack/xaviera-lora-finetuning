Morning sun, rising low, plans we made, just us two
Days ahead, we will draw, every dream coming true
Side by side, hand in hand, build a life, understand
Moments weave, carefully planned, on the solid love we stand
Life plans, with you oh it's bright, loving you feels so right
Every day, every night
Life plans take flight
Laugh and cry just the same
In this love is no shame
Playing life like a game
We've got the winner's name
Forever us forever more
Every step we'll explore explore
Heart to heart like before
Life will never abhor
Life plans with you oh it's bright
Loving you feels so right
Every day every night
Life plans take flight
Side by side hand in hand
Build a life understand
Moments leave carefully planned
On the solid love we stand
Life plans with you oh it's bright
Loving you feels so right
Every day every night
Life plans take flight
Life clans with you or with life
Loving you feels so right
Every day, every night
Life plans take flight
Life plans with you, oh it's bright
Loving you feels so right
Every day, every night
Life plans take flight
Life plans with you, oh it's bright
Loving you feels so right
Every day, every night
Life plans take flight
