So much to say in such little time
So many ways to say I love you
Why don't we laugh instead of cry
Only the bad we hold onto it
Oh isn't life so beautiful when you smile
Oh, oh
We all have our bad days
Once in a while, and
Everything you do seems to turn out wrong
Every turn you make could lead you far from home
I haven't seen your face for far too long
Please don't et, you're not alone
Oh, isn't life so beautiful when you smile?
Oh, oh, we all have our bad days once in a while
And if we knew all the things we'd go through
There'd be no surprise
And when I die
Wanna know that I felt alive
So leave the bad behind
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Yeah yeah
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Isn't life so beautiful when you smile
Oh, oh, we all have our bad days once in a while
And if we knew all the things we go through
There'd be no surprise
And when I die, I want to know that I felt alive
And if we knew all the things we'd go through, there'd be no surprise
And when I die, wanna know that I felt alive
So leave the bad behind
Yeah, yeah, yeah
