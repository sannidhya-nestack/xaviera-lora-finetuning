Act like you're different
Act like you're different, oh please
Don't be a stranger now
Don't get too far from here
Act like a spiderweb, act like a spiderweb for me
Show me the difference, show me the difference, I'll play
Bring me some happiness
Bring me some happiness, yeah, yeah
I'll be your lioness
I'll be your lioness, I'll dare, I'll
No need for promises
No need for promises, oh no
Show me the difference
Show me the difference, oh please
