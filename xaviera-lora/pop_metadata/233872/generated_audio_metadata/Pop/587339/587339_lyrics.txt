Some days a simple song is nothing but a song
A melody with words that entertain
But a song can be much more when it makes you whole
And it feels like it's a little piece of soul
Baby when you're down
I'll give you the words and the melody to cry on
Can't do no harm to hear my harmonies
Let me write you a song
I know that you got tired of the same old tunes
It seems that only minor scales can come along
Impossible to dance to the soundtrack of your life
No lullabies on earth can help you get to sleep at night
Baby when you're down
I'll give you the words and the melody to cry on
Can't do no harm to hear my harmonies
Let me write you a song
Lay your worries down on the strings of my guitar
Let the keys of my piano play what's on your mind
So baby when you're down
I'll give you the words and the melody
To cry on
Can't do no harm to hear my harmony
Let me write you a song
Let me write you a song
