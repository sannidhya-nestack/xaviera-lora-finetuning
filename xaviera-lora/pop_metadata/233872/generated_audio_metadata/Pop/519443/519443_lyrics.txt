Life is short and sweet, like a butterfly
Born to break free, life is but a dream
Fire can be warm, colors can be bright
But even the sunshine burns
I am a flower, I am a rose
Out of the ground, I'm gonna grow
I'm gonna bloom
I am a bird, on top of the world
I am more than just a little girl
I'm gonna fly
I wanna know
What I'm made of
Well, I am everything and nothing what I seem
More than who I am, only what I bring
Weather's getting cold, rain is making snow
But even the cold can't burn, mmm
I am a flower, I am a rose
Out of the ground, I'm gonna grow
I'm gonna bloom
I am a bird, on top of the world
I am more than just a little girl
I'm gonna fly
I wanna know
What I'm made of
What I'm made of
I am a flower
I am a rose
And I'm gonna bloom
I am a bird, top of the world, and I'm gonna fly
I wanna know what I'm made of, what I'm made of
