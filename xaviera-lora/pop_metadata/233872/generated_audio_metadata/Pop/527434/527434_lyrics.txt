Words freeze as they leave my lips
Still my heart beats in my fingertips
when the cold collides with the blaze inside
I don't hide, I feel alive
I love to lose myself in life
it feels alright
And I don't need no savior to unwind
I feel aligned
And I am drowning deeper
And I would die to feel alive
If my mind's deceit
My heart won't drift
And if I face defeat
I embrace it as a gift
when the world collides
With the pain inside
I don't hide
I feel alive
And I'm gonna dig in deeper into life
It's alright
And I don't need no savior to unwind
I feel aligned
And I, I'm drowning deeper
And I, would die to feel
Alive (Life too low to lose myself)
And I (Life, you're alright, don't need no savior)
Drowning deeper
And I
I'm drowning deeper and I would die to feel you
And I'm gonna dig in deeper into life, it's alright
And I'm gonna dig in deeper into life (dig in deeper) it's alright
And I don't need no savior to unwind (need no savior) cause I feel alive
I'm drowning deeper and I would die to feel alive
