August days, they
Date themselves and now it slows me down
As I think about the mistakes I may have made
Fold your clothes and you tuck them deep
With all your thoughts as you
Unfold the quiet in your mind and strip down to your solitude
Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes, here
Comes the fall, comes the fall
Fisherman they speak of
Weatherman talking of
Better weather or not you'll
Find your sun again
Sitting low in the sky
We eat lonely in the dark
As I say
I'll get some sleep tonight
But she'll keep me awake
Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes
Here comes the fall
Comes the fall
Captain Ward, you bring me to the longer days and shorter nights
Where you didn't have to keep out the cold
I'm creeping into those aching shoulders as you
Put on your stocking cap and pull the covers up
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes the fall, here comes the fall
Here comes fall
Here comes fall
