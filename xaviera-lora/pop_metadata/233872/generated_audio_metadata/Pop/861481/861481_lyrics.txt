Stone cold love drunk
We got nothing
Far from sober
Only falling deeper
Warm skin red the size
We got nothing
Far from home down
The roads all we know
Come on now baby, let's get lost
I'm feeling faded, riding these waves
Cross the ocean, let's get out
I'm feeling faded, don't you know that?
We could be bad and never go back
We could be high and never come down
We could be lovers, we could be friends
We could be the ones who never pretend
We could be bad and never go back
We could be high and never come down
We could be lovers, we could be friends
We could be the ones who never pretend
Pull me closer, give me your sins
Low key broken, only drifting further
Fall by your side, give me your sins
Low key moments, we're all the way gone
Come on now baby, let's get lost
I'm feeling faded, riding these waves
Cross the ocean, let's get out
I'm feeling faded
Don't you know that
We could be bad and never go back
We could be high and never come down
We could be lovers, we could be friends
We could be the ones who never pretend
We could be blind and never go back
We could be high and never come down
We could be lovers, we could be friends
We could be the ones who never pretend
Come on now baby, let's get lost
I'm feeling faded, riding these waves
Cross the ocean, let's get out
I'm feeling faded, riding these waves
We could be bad and never go back
We could be high and never come down
We could be lovers, we could be friends
We could be the ones who never pretend
We could be bad and never go back
We could be high and never come down
We could be lovers, we could be friends
We could be the ones who never pretend
