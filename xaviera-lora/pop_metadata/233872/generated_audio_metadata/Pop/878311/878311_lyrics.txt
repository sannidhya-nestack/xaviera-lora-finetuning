It's alright if you don't remember
It's alright baby, tell the truth
You blew my mind when you took the time to talk to me
Then again when you took the time to take a walk with me
I'm a sentimental fool when it comes to shit like that, yeah baby
Spent half the night trying to think of something good to say
You know it's been a long time since I've felt that way
I'm a tongue-tied sucker when it comes to shit like that, yeah babe
It's alright if you don't remember
It's alright baby, tell the truth
Well, you were cool, easy to talk to
With a catty-coated shell
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and you played it off so well
Some days are just a little sweeter than others
I wish it was the way it was when we met last June (I wish it was the way it was)
Any old boy would do
Can you get me home by two, yeah
That was the way it was with me and you
Long black hair, crystal blue eyes and your silky smooth skin
You had it going on, didn't know where to begin
I'm an undecided fool when it comes to shit like that, yeah boy
I wish it was the way it was when we met last June
The way it was, any old boy would do
Can you get me home by two
I wish it was the way it was when we met last June (I wish it was the way it was)
The funny place that we made love
We never seemed to get enough
That was the way it was with me and you
Take me back my yesterday, I miss your cherished smile (take me back to the world)
Take me back and love me in that good old fashioned style (take me back to the world)
Take me back my yesterday, I miss your cherished smile (take me back to the world)
Take me back and love me in that good old fashion style (take me back to the world)
Take me back
Whoa, whoa, take me back
Take me back to the world
Take me back
Whoa, whoa, take me back
