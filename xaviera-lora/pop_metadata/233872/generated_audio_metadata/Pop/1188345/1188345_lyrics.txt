Hey, hey, hey
Oh yeah
She don't ask me questions
She don't worry about my past
I tell her I'm a three time loser
And she changes the subject fast
What's on her mind is the love we find
Each and every day
She wants the man I turned out to be
Not the man I was along the way, hey, hey, hey
She don't care about the what I was
She's crazy'bout the who I am
All that matters is the here and now
Not the why and the where and the when
Yesterday is dead and gone
She wants me to be her man
She don't care about the what I was, she's crazy'bout the who I am
I used to hang around with the devil, a lot of drinking and carrying on
Every night with a different stranger, raising hell until the dawn
But the day we met, I swear I'd et, the good time, ladies and the wine
She's the only woman who believes in me
I'd be a fool to ever leave her behind
She don't care about the what I was
She's crazy'bout the who I am
All that matters is the here and now
Not the why and the where and the when
Yesterday is dead and gone
She wants me to be her man
She don't care about the what I was
She's crazy'bout the who I am
Hey hey yeah yeah
What's on her mind is the love we find each and every day
And she wants the man I turned out to be
Not the man I was along the way, hey hey hey
She don't care about the what I was
She's crazy'bout the who I am
Crazy'bout the who I am
All that matters is the here and now, not the why and the where and the when (oh no)
Yesterday is dead and gone, but she wants me to be her man (she wants me to be her man)
She don't care about the what I was, she's crazy'bout the who I am (crazy'bout the who I am)
She don't care about the what I was, she's crazy'bout the who I am (crazy'bout the who I am)
All that matters is the here and now
Not the why and the where and the when
Yesterday is dead and gone
She wants me to be her man (wants me to be her man)
But she don't care about the what I was
She's crazy'bout the who I am
