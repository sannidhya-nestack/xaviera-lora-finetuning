Hey-ya hey-ya hey-ya hey-ya hey-yay
Hey-ya hey-ya hey-ya heyyay hey-yay
(We'll make it through)
Stone by stone this wall must build
Step by step we'll walk up hills
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya-ee-ya
Chrome-made and a-hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya
Hey-ya-ee-ya
Sticks and bones, my hands are worn and old
Hearing whispers of the fortune told
With a wheel of flame we drive the men
Up the cliffs and down again
The crow inside starts to crow
Hey ya hey ya hey ya hey
Call me then, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Call me then, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey ya hey ya hey ya hey ya hey
Hey ya hey ya hey ya hey ya hey ya hey
Stone by stone this wall must build
Step by step we'll walk up hills
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey, yeah, hey ya
Yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey
Glow maiden day, yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
I'm glow maiden day
