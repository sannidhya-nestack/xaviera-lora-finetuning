I want a hayride not a high rise
I want to high fly with you in the countryside
Where we can hide
I want a spring day not a subway
I want a snow storm in June in the countryside
I need a sleigh ride
A getaway
The heart of the city
We'll play
It's colder than ice
We will stay
Here in the country
It's cold but it's nice
To see a sunrise on a mountainside
Feel the wind blowing in your face
A getaway
Where we can play
The heart of the city is colder than ice
Here in the country it's cold but it's nice
To see the sunrise on the mountainside
Feel the wind blowing in your face
A getaway, where we can play
A getaway, the heart of the city
We'll play, it's colder than ice
We will stay, here in the country
It's cold but it's nice
I wanna hang right, I need a sleigh ride
In the countryside
In the countryside (in the countryside)
