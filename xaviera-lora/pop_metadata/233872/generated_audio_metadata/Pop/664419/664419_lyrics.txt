I'm not a man that you can call
I'm not a man, no not at all
I'm not a man, I'm not a man

We're just two lovers in one
It's just love, it's just love, love, love
I'm not a killer on the run
I'm not up for a lot of fun
I'm not the man of your dreams
I'm not a thief on the loose
I'm not the guy you wanna shoot
I'm just a boy, just a boy
I won't save you in the night
I'll run away whenever fight
I'm just a boy, I'm just a boy

Oh maybe baby you ot to look at me and not your mind
I'm just a boy who hates to wake
I'm just a boy who loves to shake

You're just a girl who loves to fuck
You're just a girl, I wanna fuck
You're just a girl, you're just a girl
I'm just a boy, you're just a girl
We're just two lovers in a world
It's just love, it's just love
I'm just a boy who hates to wake
I'm just a boy who loves to shake
