It's pretty much every aspect of life has some kind of consequence.
Your small brown almond eyes
Your small brown almond eyes
Your small brown almond eyes
You got everything that I want
Your small brown almond eyes
Your small brown almond eyes
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah (Your small brown almond eyes)
(You got everything that I want)
Step over to me boy
And grab yourself a drink
It's not that kind of big thing
Girl you make me think
Anything goes you say
At least that's what your eyes tell
You're so damn good looking in your black dress
So damn good looking in your black dress, black dress
You're so damn good looking in your black dress
So damn good looking in your black dress, black dress
That's the spirit, that is the spirit
We're just moving around, turn it upside down, feeling free
That's the spirit, that is the spirit (that's the spirit)
There is a new sound in town, lifts you off the ground, yeah yeah
That's the spirit, that is the spirit (that's the spirit)
We're just moving around, turn it upside down
Feeling free (that's the spirit)
There is a new sound in town, lifts you off the ground, yeah yeah
Step over to me boy
And grab yourself a drink
It's not that kind of big thing
Girl you make me think
Anything goes you say
At least that's what your eyes tell
You're so damn good looking in your black dress
I'm under your spell
You're so damn good looking in your black dress
You small brown almond eyes
You small brown almond eyes
You got everything that I want
