Un, deux, trois, quatre, trois
Oh, Bonjour Monsieur
Can I drive you for a tour
De France?
Oh, um, what I meant to say is
Can I see your Eiffel Tower?
What I'm trying to say is I want to see you Paris
Up on the vest but now here we go
you are lovely, you are eous
You are, you are, you are
From Champs-Élysées, chic shops to cafés, voué parfait, voué
I'm falling for you, oh I adore you, d'etre petit, petit, petit
Yeah, two shot espresso, hurry catch a metro
To what I hear is a lovely museum
We walk along the Seine, I throw caution to the wind
You give me a reason to be Parisian
Oui Madame is beaucoup impressed
But not Notre Dame just yet
French kiss of Fondareau
Now I'm in the mood to see your Paris
you are lovely, you are eous
You are, you are, you are
From Champs-Élysées, chic shops to café
Voué, parfait, voué
I'm falling for you
Oh, I adore your dix-a-petit, petit, petit
Your bright evening sky is tarp into Luxembourg
More cheese and wine, see the play
et about the world as you wrap me in your pretty city light
'Cause you are lovely
You are eous
You are, you are, you are
From Champs-Élysées
Shake shops to Café Bouée
Parfait Bouée
I'm falling for you
Oh, I adore you
Des de Paris, Paris, Paris
I've just discovered you are my lover Monsieur Petit
