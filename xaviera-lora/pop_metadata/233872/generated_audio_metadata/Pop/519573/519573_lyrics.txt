Something just has got to give
I can't leave and you won't bend
The little things, they just don't get bigger
It's never enough, and then it doesn't get better
Life comes in small, medium and large
Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's hard
Life comes in small, medium and large
Sometimes it's good
Someone takes, someone gives
You do what you do, it's just what it is
Oh and it's sweet, it's not for long
It's not where you stay, it's how you move on
Because life comes in small, medium and large
Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's hard
Life comes in small, medium and large
Sometimes it's good
So I will love you tonight
You know it's never just right
Days they come and then they're gone
But life goes on
You just got to go on
Life comes in small, medium and large
Sometimes it's good
That something just has got to give
'Cause I can't leave and you won't
