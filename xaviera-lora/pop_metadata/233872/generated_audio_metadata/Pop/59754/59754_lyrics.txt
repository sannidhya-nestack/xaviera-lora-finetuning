Hey, hey, hey, oh
The way that you do to me is just like I like it
Inside me I believe you just like I like it
Many days may come and go
Many nights the stars don't show
Time stops when it's you I'm thinking of, yeah
Sitting here with my head in my hand
Contemplating ideas we planned
Facing the world around us
Getting ready to do what we both dream of
We waited to do it to please just like I like it
Inside me I believe you just like I like it
It can rain or it can snow
What I feel won't let go
No excuses I yearn for my lovely
Reach for you, you're always there
Though you're not here, you're everywhere
Like the ocean, lights are blue
Enormous love I give, I give to you
The way that you do it to me is just like I like it
Inside me I believe you just like I like it
The way that you do to me is just like I like it
Inside me I believe you just like I like it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
What you want you can tell me
Tell me baby what you need
There is nothing I won't do
There's no fear cause I believe
When in doubt it's you I see
There's no fear cause I believe
There is nothing I won't do
To take my chance in life without you
The way that you do it to me is just like I like it (loving, loving me, loving me)
Inside me I believe you just like I like it
The way that you do it to me is just like I like it
Inside me I believe you just like I like it
The way that you do to me is just like I like it
Inside me I believe it just like I like it
