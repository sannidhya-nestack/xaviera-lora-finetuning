In a dark room
I hear voices
They deceive me
And discourage me
It is here
I can feel it
No one believes that it exists
Stone and glass, I'll find you soon, and we'll die
'Til morning comes, my other part is flying away
It's little bit hard but I'll be okay, no, no, no
It's not airplane, something inside
I'd rather lead a lonely life
Stone and glass, I'll find you soon
Then we'll die
Till morning comes
