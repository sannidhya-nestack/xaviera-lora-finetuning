Used to be I was all in a hurry
Seemed like nothing got done fast enough
But now you're here, I figure
What's the rush?
Slow me down, love me up
Used to be I was always the sad one
Took myself oh so seriously
But since you came along I'm playful as a pup
You slowed me down, loved me up
Used to be, I thought love was a train
And it just kept on passing me by
But since you came, I'm beginning to think
True love has finally arrived
Used to be love was just an illusion
Just a trick done with mirrors and smoke
But now you're here and you look real enough
Slow me down, love me up
Yeah now you're here and you look real enough
Slow me down, love me hard
Used to be, I thought love was a trade
And it just kept on passing me by (passing me by)
But since you came I've begun to think
True love has finally arrived
