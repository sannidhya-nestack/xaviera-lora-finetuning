Could not pass you by (I love you)
Something stops my life (I miss you)
Sure I need to try (I want you)
Hold on, hold on baby
Any word from you (I love you, I love you)
Makes my dreams come true (I miss you, I miss you)
My heart's in your sway (I want you, I want you)
Hold on, hold on baby (Let's go, let's go)
Cannot pass you by (I love you, I love you)
Something stops my life (I miss you, I miss you)
Sure I need to try (I'm with you, I'm with you)
Hold on, hold on baby (I love you, I love you)
(I miss you, I miss you)
I'm gonna pass you by (I love you, I love you)
Something stops my life (I miss you, I miss you)
Sure I need to try (I love you, I love you)
Hold on, hold on baby
Any word from you
Makes my dreams come true
My heart's in your swing
Hold on hold on baby
