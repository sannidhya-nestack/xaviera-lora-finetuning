Troubles, they may come and go
They don't bother me, I know
You're only a dream away
And though we may be miles apart
When I sleep you're here sweetheart
You're only a dream away
You're only a dream away
I can't wait to go to sleep today
And when I do, I'll be with you
And hope I wake to find my dream come true
One day you'll be coming back
Until then, I think I'll hit the sack
You're only
Her dream away
Bop bop bop
Ba da ba ba da bop bop
Ba ba ba
Ba da ba ba da ba ba
Ba ba da ba ba da ba
Ba da ba ba da ba ba
Ba da ba ba da ba
Ba da ba ba da ba ba
You're only a dream away
I can't wait to go to sleep today
And when I do, I'll be with you
And hope I wake to find my dream come true
One day you'll be coming back
Until then I think I'll hit the sack
You're only
Only, only a dream away
