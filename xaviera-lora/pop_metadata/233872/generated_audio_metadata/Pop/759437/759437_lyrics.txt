The town in evening
Lights are launched
The smell's like from
A cutted grass
I'm running from place which curse is watched
But diving in
The life to pass
Night
The moonlight trembles in the water
I'm searching for love
Many of moon years
The extremely brightened fires
Of slaughtered in water
That can't make me dry from tears
I wanna discover where rivers stream
Who follows it in a cool blue
I wanna discover where our star beams
Who will uncover secret view night
The moonlight trembles in the water
I'm searching for love, many of new years
The extremely brightened fires of slow time
In water that can't make me dry from tears
The extremely brightened fires of slow time
The water that cannot make me dry from tears
Can it make me dry?
