Feel the wind it's calling
Whispers through the trees
Nature's voices falling
Sway with the breeze
Sunshine on my shoulder
Birds are flying free
Life is so much bolder
Sway with the breeze
Sway, sway with the breeze
Let your worries ease
Sway, sway with the breeze
Feel the moment freeze
Stars come out at night time
Moonlight on the seas
Rhythms of a lifetime
Sway with the breeze
Memories we're making
Laughter on our knees
Hearts are never breaking
Sway with the breeze
Sway, sway with the breeze, let your worries ease
Sway, sway with the breeze, feel the moment freeze
Stars come out at night time
Moonlight on the seas
Rhythms of a lifetime
Sway with the breeze
Memories we're making
Laughter on our knees
Hearts are never breaking
Sway with the breeze
Sway, sway with the breeze
Let your worries ease
Sway, sway with the breeze
Feel the moment freeze
