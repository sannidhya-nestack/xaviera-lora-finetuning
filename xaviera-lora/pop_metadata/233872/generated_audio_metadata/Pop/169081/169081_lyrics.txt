Sometimes we live our life
Sometimes we et what's wrong and right
And sometimes we choose to deny like we're living in a fairy tale
It gets so easy and we take it all for granted
Life is so precious never take the time to understand
Never understand
I, I, I've been thinking about all the things that you told me
And I, I, I needed you now more than I never needed anyone
And I, I, it's getting so lonely, I wish you could hold me
And I, I, I've been missing your smile
I know that I wasn't always right
The fruit of temptation came I took a bite
My life's been turned upside down and there's no one else to blame but me
It gets so easy and then we take it all for granted
Life is so precious we never take the time to understand
Never understand
And I, I've been thinking about all the things that you told me and I, I needed you now more than I ever needed anyone and I, it's getting so lonely I wish you could hold me and I, I've been missing your smile
The ones that we hurt are always the ones we love the most
The more that you give, the more you receive
I believe, I believe
It's not worth it to deceive
The ones that we hurt are always the ones we love the most
The more that you give, the more you receive
I believe, I believe
I, I, I've been thinking about all the things that you told me and
I, I needed you now more than I ever needed anyone and
I, I
I know it's getting so lonely, I wish you could hold me in
I, I, I've been missing your, whoa, whoa, whoa
I, I, I've been thinking about all the things that you told me and
I, I, I
I needed you now more than I never needed anyone and I
It's getting so lonely I wish you could hold me and I
I've been missing your smile, I
I've been thinking about all the things that you told me and I
I needed you now more than I never needed anyone and
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
It's getting so lonely, I wish you could hold me and
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I've been missing your smile
