Don't be cruel, don't be mean
But don't be sweet and wonderful
Be alright, be okay
So it's easy to leave when you take it away
And I am only protecting
I
I'm sick of investing, I'm scared
That road paved with fear
I'm not going that way, maybe next year
And you might be perfect for me
But hold it back, baby (hold it back, baby)
I'm not ready (I'm not ready)
When you smile, I start to feel
Cover it up, don't be so real
Tone it down (tone it down)
Make mistakes (make mistakes)
Tie your love to an anchor, then swim far away
And I am fighting this fury
And you are not gonna save me
I'm scared
That road paved with fear
I'm not going that way
Maybe next year (Maybe next year)
And you might be perfect for me (Perfect for me)
But hold it back baby (Baby, baby)
I'm not ready
'Cause I won't be let down again
I'm ready to let go
Just tell me when, just tell me when
And you might be perfect for me
But don't you know Sid
He killed his Nancy
And I think you're so perfect for me (so perfect for me)
That's why you should hold back (that's why you should hold back)
I'm not ready
I'm not ready
