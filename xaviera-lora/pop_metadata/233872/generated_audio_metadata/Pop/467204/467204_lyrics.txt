Set my beauty free
Need no sanctity, don't put me down
Need none to protect me, I've been around
My destiny is up to me
So just let me be
Let me be
Let me be
Let me be free
I don't think like you
You say I'm proud
I'm my own person, I scream it aloud
All that I dream is up to me
So just let me be
Let me be me
Let me be
Let me be free
Everything has changed, yet it all stays the same
Call it by a different name
I wanna change the rules of the game, yeah
My sense of self is strong, so don't patronize
I have honor and courage, I will not be denied
I'll do things my way
No matter what you say, just let me be
Let me be me
Let me be me
Let me be me
Let me be free to be me (Let me be)
Let me be free to be me (Let me)
Let me be free I wanna be the love maybe
I am strong when I am me
Everything I dreamed to be I can be
My destiny is to be free
I gotta be all I can be
Can't you see?
Let me be free to be me
I gotta be me
I gotta be free
