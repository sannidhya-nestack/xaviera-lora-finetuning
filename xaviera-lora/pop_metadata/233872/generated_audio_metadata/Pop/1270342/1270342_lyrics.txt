Blue rivers flow gently
Sunlight in my eyes
Dancing shadows play
Under clear blue skies
Soft whispers in the breeze
Nature's sweet embrace
Memories in my trees
Time slows its pace
Blue rivers and you
Dreams come alive
Hand in hand we move
A love we can't deny
Golden fields we roam
Endless days of light
Laughter in our home
Stars shine so bright
In your eyes I see a world so true
Lost in harmony with rivers blue
Blue rivers and you
Dreams come alive
Hand in hand we move
A love we can't deny
Soft whispers in the breeze
Nature's sweet embrace
Memories in the trees
Time slows its pace
Blue rivers and you
Dreams come alive
Hand in hand we move
A love we can't deny
