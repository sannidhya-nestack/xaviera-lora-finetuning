Teardrops fallin' on the back streets, a stereo-based solitaire (oh yeah)
Expensive boots on mother's feet, you know the boys on the counter don't care
And Debbie takes a walk down Bond Street
To buy herself a new dress (so nice)
And the kids in those secret places
Trying hard to clean out the mess
And the light comes in on the city
And the brothers roll out like ants
For those sticky moves that you made
All the people on the top come to dance
They come to dance
They kept you dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
And the light shines bright down Main Street
To a place somewhere out of view
Behind the bar there's a secret entrance
We're secret brothers, rendezvous
And Jackie has a cup for the weekend
I feel the warmth stop when in her hand
And the kids in the secret places
Fall back tight into the chair
And the night comes and I'm making it to it
I'm making road to Salt Square
And soon he said to Janet on the ceiling
There's nothing going on out there
They come to dance
They come to dance
They come to dance
They come to dance
They come to dance dance dance dance
They come to dance dance dance dance
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-La-la-la
They come to dance
They come to dance
They come to dance
They come to dance
They come to dance
Who can't they come to dance
Who can't they come to dance
Come to dance come to dance come to dance come to dance come to dance come to dance come to dance come to dance come to dance come to dance come to dance come to dance
