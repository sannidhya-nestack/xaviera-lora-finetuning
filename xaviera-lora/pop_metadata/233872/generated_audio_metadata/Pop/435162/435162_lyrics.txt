Okay, I'm going to read the words a little slowly at first.

The night has a thousand eyes
आजारों आनकी है शब्द की
The day but one
सुभोल की बस एक
The night has a thousand eyes
The day but one
But the light of the whole world dies
When day is done
The mind has a thousand eyes
The heart but one
But the light of the whole world dies
When love is done
The night has a thousand eyes, nizaro aankhe shabt
The heart but one, dil ki bas ek
The light of the whole world dies, roshniye jahan magar hoti hai tamaam
Then love is done
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Love is done
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, love is gone
The night has a thousand eyes
The day but one
But the light of the whole world dies
When day is done
And the mind has a thousand eyes
The heart but one
But the light of the whole world dies when love is done
