Building an empire on the sun
Personal palace from every womb
No doors to keep you from returning
Your footsteps are the path I took
I stood here once before I found you
The center of another day
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Watching the earth revolve around me
Static trance, the drifting sun
A memory of my only lover
No equilibrium, no control
I stood here once before I found you
The centre of another day, oh yeah, oh yeah
Building an empire on the sun
Posting no palace from every wall
I stood here once before I found you
The center of another day
The sacrament that sends me flying
My empire on the sun, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
