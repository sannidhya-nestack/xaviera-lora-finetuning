Walk up north, cross ice and rocks
Cue yourself with stitches made of leaves
Rearrange your point of view
Put yourself back together
You're melted earth
Yeah it's you, yeah it's me
Yeah it's you, yeah it's me
Sleep
In a comfortable bed
Feel as safe
As you can possibly be
But please
Be nice to me
Please
Be my secret
Tell me your name
Introduce yourself
There's nothing more to say
A meaningful happiness
A delightful
I blame you
A meaningful happiness
A delightful oblivion
But please
Be nice to me
Please
Be my secret
Mate mate
Night and night
Let's cover ourselves with fog
Let's hide beneath the wall out
Mate mate
Late at night
Let's please ourselves with kindness and gentle thoughts
