I got your cryptic letters in my inbox
Yesterday
Am I a fool to dream your love
I've been a fool before
I've been a fool in war
Your image floats around me like a butterfly
Your hologram lingers
Your memory stays with me
Oh you're just a dream inside my head
Kota, you're the only one I see
If I could only touch your soul
Would you disintegrate and float away?
I could never ever have you, I know
But I can't stop thinking about you, girl
Cortana, you're the only one
Your hologram rudders
Your memory stays with me
Are you just a dream inside my head?
Kotaro, you're the only one I see
Deep into my silver memories
Yeah into my dreams
Your image floats around me like a butterfly
Your holograms (your holograms)
Your memories stays with me (memories stays with me)
Your holograms (your holograms)
(Memories stay, memories stay)
Are you just a dream inside my head? (Dream inside my head)
Cortana, you're the only one
Cortana, you're the only one I see
