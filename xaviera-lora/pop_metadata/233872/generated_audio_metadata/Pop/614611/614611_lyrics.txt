Yeah, do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
I think you better believe me
I'll lock you up inside
If I should ever find out
You've been out tonight
Somebody wants you
Someone out there makes me know
There's nothing left of yesterday
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
I'm the one who wants you
I'm the one who cares
Yeah, I know I'll be sorry
For letting you go out there
And all the shadows change my mood in every way
My baby's gone (she's gone) I know not where (nowhere)
My baby's gone (she's gone) I just don't care (don't care)
But you know there's nothing left of yesterday
Do-do-do-do-do
And you know there's nothing left of yesterday
Do-do-do-do-do
And all the shadows change my mood in every way
My baby's gone, I'm not where
My baby's gone, I just don't care
But you know there's nothing left of yesterday
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
No there's nothing left of yesterday
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
One dream, one mind, one day I'll find
The love will flow, but right now I don't really know
She's gone, and you're not where, my baby's gone
I just don't care,'cause you know there's nothing left of yesterday
You know there's nothing left of yesterday
You know there's nothing left of yesterday
