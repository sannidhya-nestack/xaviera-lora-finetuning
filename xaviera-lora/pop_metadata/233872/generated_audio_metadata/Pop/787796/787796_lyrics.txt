The world is bigger than me, bigger than I'll ever be
I don't think I'll ever see what's right in front of me
I hate how much we have changed, everything has rearranged
I want exactly the same, can we go back again?
Will everything work out?
I guess I'll never know
You're turning me inside out
Upside down
Round and round
Can anyone hear me now?
I'm inside out
Shouting aloud
Feet off the ground
I'm never coming down
I don't know what I will do, my world is broken in two
I feel like I never knew, it's all because of you
This is the way it will be, this is how life is for me
I hope that one day I'll see what's right in front of me
I know that it will work out
I've never been so sure
You're turning me inside out
Upside down
Round and round
Can anyone hear me now?
I'm inside out
Shouting aloud
Feet off the ground
I'm never coming down
When my emotions are talking to me
And this is what they say
Keep your head up, stay strong, and you'll be all that you can be
You're turning me inside out, upside down, round and round
Can anyone hear me now? I'm inside out, shout it aloud, feet off the ground
I'm never coming down
You're turning me inside out
Upside down, round and round
Can anyone hear me now? I'm inside out, shouting aloud
Feet off the ground, I'm never coming down
Inside out, upside down
Round and round, can anyone hear me now?
I'm inside out, shouting aloud
Feet off the ground, I'm never coming down
Inside out, inside out, inside out
Inside out, inside out, inside out, inside out
