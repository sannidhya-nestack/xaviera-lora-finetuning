There's a place independent of time and space
Where together the sun is smiling
And the sky is always blue
But it's a place you'll never see
A place that's only known by me
A secret that no one else knows
Just a wish I suppose
Where your heart never goes
Love, they say, has the power to win the day
And I've heard that the pen of the poet
Can conquer the sword
But the fortress built around your heart
Stone and iron that keep us apart
Is a wall that I can't ever breach
Through action or speech
It's a place I can't reach
I can't stand so near
When you look you'll see I'm right here
But the distance that stands between us
Is as wide as the sea
I'm a shadow on the land no more
Just a figure on some distant shore
A notion too absurd to propose
A dream no one knows
Where your heart never goes
