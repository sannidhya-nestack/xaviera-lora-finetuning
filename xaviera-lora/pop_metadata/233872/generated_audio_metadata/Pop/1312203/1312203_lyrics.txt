Let's play a little game
You'll be a prince and I'll be a princess
Boy just don't be too lame
I'm gonna make you play or I'm breaking all the glass
We are nasty in our souls
You're a scary clown and I'm a spooky doll
Darling would you be that kind?
Promise me that you will catch me when I fall
Pink dress with lace, parasol and black nails
My warm embrace was never enough for your own game
Why did you bring roses to that other girl?
She doesn't belong to our magic world
Why did you just stare at that other girl?
She doesn't belong to our magic world
Why did you bring roses to that other girl?
She doesn't belong to our magic world
Why did you just stare at that other girl?
She doesn't belong to our magic world
She doesn't belong to our magic world
She doesn't belong to our magic world
Why did you stare at that other girl
Why did you stare at that other girl
We are nesting in our souls
You're a scary clown and I'm a spooky doll
Darling, would you be that kind?
Promise me that you will catch me when I fall
Pink dress with lace
Barista with black nails
My warm embrace was never enough for your wrong game
Why did you bring roses to that other girl?
She doesn't belong to our magic world
Why did you just stare at that other girl?
She doesn't belong to our magic world
Why did you bring roses to that other girl?
She doesn't belong to our magic world
Why did you just stare at that other girl?
She doesn't belong to our magic world
She doesn't belong to our magic world
She doesn't belong to our magic world
