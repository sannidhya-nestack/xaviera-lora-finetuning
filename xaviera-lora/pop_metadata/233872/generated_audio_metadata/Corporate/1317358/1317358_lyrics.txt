Yeah, yeah, uh, we blowin' up, uh, uh
Whole squad lit, yeah, we shuttin' this down
One-one, no stoppin' when the baseline hit
Drip too hard, better watch that fit
Drip too hard, better watch that fit
Two-two, from the gutter now walk like a king
From the, from the dimmer chain, let'em dance when I swing
Every step I take that's a boss move made
Step by step I throw shade but I shine in the fade
Roche Roche like the city when the street lights flash
Pocket full of dreams and a duffel full of cash
Confidence loud like a 12 inch speaker
Swagger so sharp cut deep like a cleaver
I see the lights I hear the sound
Baseline jump we shake the ground
Ain't no fear I own this stage
Dope dope flop
Quick, turn the next page
Blow up, blow up, yeah we taking flight
Diamonds in the dark, yeah we shine so bright
Blow up, blow up, let the beat drop
Hands in the air, we ain't never gon' stop
Aye look at me now I was broke last year
Mean wrist off flooded iced out chandelier off
They ain't see the grind only see the success
See the move calculated yeah I'm playing like chess
Running through the city where the big boy stands
Through the suit is chest out like I'm built to advance
Ain't no second place when the crown's my sign
Had to work for the glow, now the whole world vibes
Middle fingers to the past, I'm way too blessed
Only time I take L's is on my Louis vest
Draped in the fire and it's shining like the sun
If life is a race then the race just begun
Blow up, blow up, yeah we taking flight
Diamonds in the dark, yeah we shine so bright
Blow up, blow up, let the beat drop
Hands in the air, we ain't never gonna stop
Yeah, whole squad glow like a light show
Boss up, pull up, that's how life go
Boss never back down, only rise up
King of my city, yeah we two up
