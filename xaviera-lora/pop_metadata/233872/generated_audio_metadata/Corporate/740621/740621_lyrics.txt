You should be with me for the length of the sea
Until we're old and drinking tea
You should be mine like bread and wine
God has sent us a sign
Can't wait to start
It's time to mend your heart, the minutes and hours, my love, it towers
You should be with me every day
Until we're old and glowing grey
You should be my life, sun and shine
That would be perfectly fine
Can't wait to start, it's time to mend your heart
The minutes and hours, my love it doesn't work
Everyday when I look at you
It's in your eyes you can feel it too
Won't you come away so we can be free
And live our lives
You should be with me like the spring and the rain
Until we're old and time's healed our pain
You should be mine'cause God sent a sign
You should be mine all of the time
