Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Turquoise dreams
Tears of gold, magenta leaves
Scenes of indigo, paradise, paradise
Ocean talking sea
Inner sorrow
Rosen and rot here
Oh
Touch
Angels force
Draw me near
To a place
Beyond the feeling in the wind
A bird, a crown on your cheek, desire
So fire, sun, moon, sun, take down my fears
Calling me
Of cold tranquility
Past the never-lasting stuff we fought
Life of moments, world of joy
Fleeting seconds, lost eternity
Peace
One dream, yeah
One dream, oh
This be nothing
Yet be anything
One dream
