I found you in the best days of summer in the sunset glow I was kissing you
Feel so young and free
Feel the magic of this summer heat
From dusk till dawn
I was missing you
I found you
In the best days of summer
In the sunset glow
I was kissing you
Be so young and free
Feel the magic of this summer heat
From dusk till dawn
I was missing you
You're the sea and I'm the light that's shining for you
Wherever you need me, wherever you are
Going to, going to, going to
Going to
You're the sea and I'm the light
That's shining for you
Wherever you need me
Wherever you are
You're the sea and I'm the light
You're my life of the night
You're the sea and I'm the light
You're my life of the night
You're the sea and I'm the light
You're my life of the night
You're the sea and I'm the light
You're my life of the night
You're the sea and I'm the light
You're my life of the night
You're the sea and I'm the light
You're my life of the night
You're the sea and I'm the light
You're my life of the night
You're the sea and I'm the light
You're my life, life, life
I found you
I found you
Going to, going to
Going to, going to
You're the sea and I'm the light that's shining for you
Wherever you lead me, wherever you are
You're the sea and I'm the light
You're my life of the night
You're the sea and I'm the light
You're my life of the night
You're the sea and I'm the light
You're my life of the night
You're the sea and I'm the light
You're my life of the night
