I never believed my vacant heart could be completely overflowing
Buried dreams not coming true
I wondered why the world never opened their eyes to me
I couldn't walk, I couldn't see'til I thought of you
I thought of you
Stumble through the moonlight blind
Letting envy across my mind
I thought I'd see the day light, thought of you
Oh, I never imagined I'd have all I'd ever need
Blew my first opportunity, you gave me two
I never knew how our relationship affected me
I was unaware I had a friend in you, no
'Til I thought of you
Steppin' through the moonlight blind
Headin' into your cross-town mind
And I thought I'd see the day
I thought of you
I thought of you
Not for your eyes
I never filled in my fake and hide could be completely over
No affair dreams not coming true
I wonder why the world never opened their mouth to me
I couldn't walk couldn't see what I thought of
Till I
I thought of you
Stumbled through the moonlight blind
Heading empty across my mind
I thought I'd see the daylight
Thought of you
Stumbled through the moonlight blind
Heading empty across my mind
I thought I'd see the daylight
Thought of you
I thought of you
I thought of you
I'm not you, you
