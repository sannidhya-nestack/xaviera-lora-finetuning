Eyes are on the prize, get it on'til you're finished
Lookin' in the mirror sayin' "Gon' keep on winnin'"
I just wanna be the best
No matter what you've gotta be
The best
Lovin' every minute of what I'm doin'
Take it in, hustle'til you're dyin'
Risin', don't you ever give in
I just wanna be the best
No matter what you've gotta be
The best
Slavin' for the money's with my life I can do something
Everyday obstacles that take a lot to overcome
See being raised in less than perfect conditions can be vicious
Especially when the reaper in jail find you delicious
Population gettin' bigger while our resources diminished
Been a minute since we as a people have shown we got some vision
Doin' whatever it takes to make this world a better place
Although the struggle is real you gotta punch it in the face
Certainly not condoning violence (of course not)
Basically asking not to make mistakes that I did (yeah don't make the same mistakes I did)
Sleepless nights of being gloomy and crying (I could sleep)
Now I wake up every morning jolly and smiling (but now I'm here, still standing, still strong)
Eyes are on the prize, give it all until you're finished
Looking in the mirror saying "go on, keep on winning"
I just wanna be (I wanna be the best)
No matter what you gotta be (you gotta be the best)
Lovin' every minute of what I'm doin' (I'm lovin' every minute of what I'm doin')
Just get it, hustle'til you're dyin' (I'm lovin' every minute of what I'm doin')
Breath in, don't you ever give in (Don't you ever give in)
I just wanna be the best (I wanna be the best)
No matter what, you've gotta be the best (I gotta be the best, I need to be the best)
Experiences that I'm still not believin' (I still can't believe it's right here)
A war is one I never thought I'd be receivin' (I never thought I would be anything)
Lord knows this man here is barely breathin' (I'm barely breathin')
Ridiculous all of my dreams I'm achieving
Father thank you for just changing my life completely
Had no idea what I was seeking
Chasing the money where it seemed easy
Put special people in my way and did right by em
Now the drugs in this blood ain't impossible to stop
Trying soaring high as a bird and now it's quite hard to stop flying
Been saving up this money kinda hard for it to stop
First hand advice to make a guy to be in not silent and don't look back on you wonder if I'm a cop, sorry now
Eyes are on the prize, give it all until you finish looking in the mirror saying gone keep on winning I just wanna be
The best, no matter what you gotta be, the best
Lovin' every minute of what I'm doin' to get it
Hustle to it, diein' breathin', don't you ever give it up
I just wanna be the best
No matter what, you've gotta be the best
