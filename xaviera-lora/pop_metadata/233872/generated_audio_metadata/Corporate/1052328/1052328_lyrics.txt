Saw you standing in the light
Made my way over'cause I know you felt it too
I'm not wasting no more time
I'm not afraid because there's something in your eyes
Love of my life
Love of my life, no
Don't get emotional
Oh no
Oh tonight
Saw you standing in the light
Made my way over cause I know you felt it too
I'm not wasting no more time
I'm not afraid because there's something in your eyes
Love of my life, love of my life, no
Don't get emotional, no
You should already know me and love don't get on it
You should already know with my heart I am so guarded
