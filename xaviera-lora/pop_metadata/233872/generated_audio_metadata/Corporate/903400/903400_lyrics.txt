I was out here workin' hard (ayy)
Only option was pushin' shopping carts (ayy)
It was awful, now I push the start (ayy)
Had to profit, the watch up on my wrist (ayy)
Get your coffins, I wake up eatin' every morning
I got tired of my days bein' so boring
I gave it all up so they wouldn't ignore me
The rest is history here's my life story
I put the key in the ignition that junk wouldn't budge
Had to get it out the mud I was stuck with no one to help
Don't get me wrong my parents let me stay with them till 25 now I pay for their house and mine
Invested my lil money what they tryna get signed
Crazy how much I done worked just to make this hip hop work
Haven't cut off Netflix and Hulu before my car no on the first
At that point promised myself I won't let it get much worse
But it's overtime just so I could keep
Recordin' life when finances in a bind
It's hard to find someone to help you grind
Them Valentine's I told my girl I'd make it up
Give her the world for all the nickel and diamond
Turned the antique pearls into diamonds
Had that Geo Prism high mileage
Chasing treasure like pirates
Till your tracks all vibrant
Then Air One and Meyer, yeah
My only intention was inspiring'em
I never had role models
That were out here straight stylin'
So I mixed what I was taught
With the lifestyle I was working hard
Only option was pushing shopping carts
It was awful now I pushed the start
Had to profit the watch upon my wrist
Get your coffin
I wake up each and every morning
I got tired of my days being so boring
I gave it all up so they wouldn't ignore me
The rest is history here's my life story
College classrooms writing these business plans
Looking back I always been a business man
Go home after a full day staring up at the ceiling fan
Peeling through imaginary bills in a rubber band
Was tired of PBJ sandwiches on the bunny bread
And having to scrape up loose change to buy my girl gummy bears
That's the reason I do this, so my funds are sufficient
No more broke bros working six until six just for overtime
To cover your necessities
Made it off the streets to Sesame
God been blessing me
First he gave me the drive
Then he gave me the why
So mom and dad can travel
Wherever they like
Next came the homie
Put me onto the music
Followed my entrepreneurship degree
Had to fuse'em
My cousin who told me
Boy you don't need a label
et a percentage
Keep all the chips on the table
I was out here working hard, ay
Only option
Was crushing shopping carts (was crushing shopping carts)
It was awful (it was awful)
Now I pushed the start (now I pushed the start)
Had to profit (had to profit)
The watch up on my wrist (the watch up on my wrist)
Get your coffin (get your coffin)
I wake up each and every morning (each and every morning)
Got tired of my days being so boring (got tired of my days being so boring)
I gave it all up so they wouldn't ignore me (they wouldn't ignore me)
The rest is history, here's my life story (here's my life story)
