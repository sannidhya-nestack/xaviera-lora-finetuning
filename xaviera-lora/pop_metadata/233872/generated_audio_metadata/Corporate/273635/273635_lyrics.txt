I heard your voice
You called my name
It makes me feel
Like my heart's in flames
And when we touch
My soul ignites
I know inside
That you're my every night
My every night
You're my every night
My every night
You're my every night
I kiss your lips
Your body moved
Your eyes they closed
You give me proof
And when you love me
Your spirit fills me
I know you want me
You set me free
You're my every night
You're my every night
You're my every night
You're my every night
When all the pain is gone
When all the words are unsung
When all the songs are sung
Still you'll be the only one
You're my every night
You're my every night
You're my every night
You're my every night
I heard your voice
You called my name
It makes me feel
Like my heart's in flames
