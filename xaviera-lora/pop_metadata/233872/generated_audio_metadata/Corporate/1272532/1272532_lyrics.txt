Wake up in the morning light
Ain't no one gonna make you bright
Got your dreams up in the sky
Spread your wings and learn to fly
Nobody's giving you a hand
Gotta rise and take a stand
Road is tough but don't you stop
You got the power at the top
Do it, do it yourself
Ain't no one else gonna help
Take your dreams off the shelf
Do it, do it yourself
Every step I wish to lift
Working hard's your special gift
All you need is deep inside
Trust in you and take the ride
When the world feels cold and dark
You're the one to make the spark
Light the fire show your might
Shining brightly through the night
Do it do it yourself
Ain't no one else gonna help
Take your dreams off the shelf
Do it, do it yourself
Do it, do it yourself
Ain't no one else gonna help
Take your dreams off the shelf
Do it, do it yourself
Do it, do it yourself
Do it, do it yourself
Do it, do it yourself
Every step or race you lift
Working hard's your special gift
All you need is deep inside
Trust in you and feel right
Do it, do it yourself
Ain't no one else gonna help
Take your dreams off the shelf
Do it, do it yourself
Do it, do it yourself
Take your dreams off the shelf
Do it, do it yourself
Do it, do it yourself
