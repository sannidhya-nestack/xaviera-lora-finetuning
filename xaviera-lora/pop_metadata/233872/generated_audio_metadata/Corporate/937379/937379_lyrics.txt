Writing my thoughts before I go on the runway
Singing in my head as I walk in the glare of lights
et that I love you, oh so deeply
et that I love you, oh so deeply, deeply
Nothing will help
Colours won't help
Everybody's watching my step
I'm looking out for you
Your eyes, which follow me
Oh, so deeply, deeply
Your eyes, which follow me
Oh, so deeply, deeply
Will you take me out of myself?
Will you leave me alone by myself?
et that I love you, oh so deeply
et that I love you, oh so deeply, deeply
Your eyes which followed me, oh so deeply, deeply
Your eyes which followed me
Oh so deeply, deeply
