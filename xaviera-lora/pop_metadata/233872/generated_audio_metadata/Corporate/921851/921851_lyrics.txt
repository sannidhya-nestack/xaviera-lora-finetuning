Up, down, down, down, up, down, down, up, down, up, up, up, up, up, down, down, up, up, down, down, up
Fearless lovers, we're fearless lovers
We're fearless lovers
Let's go on down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Call it, call it, call it, call it, call it
(Outro)
Oh my god, that's awesome!
Fearless lovers
We're fearless lovers
We're fearless lovers
Let's go on down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Muffled)
