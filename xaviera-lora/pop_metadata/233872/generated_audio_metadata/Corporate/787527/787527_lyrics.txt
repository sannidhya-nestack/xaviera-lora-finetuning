And I'm looking
And I'm searching
For the one
And I'm looking
And I'm searching
And I'm looking
For the one
Open up your mind, see me coming
Open up your eyes, see that I'm here
And I'm looking, and I'm searching
For the one, for the one
See me upside down when I'm searching
I'm turning inside out when you are alive
I'm looking and I'm searching
For the one, for the one
See me upside down
When I'm searching
When I'm looking
For the one
And I'm searching
And I'm looking
For the one
For the one
And I'm looking and I'm searching for the one
