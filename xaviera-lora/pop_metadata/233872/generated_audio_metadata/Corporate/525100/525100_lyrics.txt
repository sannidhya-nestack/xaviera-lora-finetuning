Give me shelter in your loving arms
Help me out on this Christmas day
Once had love but I lost my way
So give me shelter in your loving arms
I have a memory of a silver Christmas tree
I remember the laughter and the beautiful fire
But it's easy now, maybe just the whiskey
It all fell apart and I don't even know why
But the things I loved, it was a slow goodbye
Help me out on this Valentine's day
She loved me once but didn't stay
Keep me safe from my own deceit and harm
Give me shelter in your loving arms
I wake with the hangover, I'm still in my bed
Everywhere I look is just a sea of red
TV, the newspaper, posters and Hallmark cards
For all those romance and love and diehards
I knew love once, but I love the battle more
Can you give me shelter in those loving arms
I'm not doing okay on my kid's own birthday
The things I've done I've got to pay
So please give me shelter in those loving arms
I can't raise my eyes to meet her own
Of all the days to miss, not her own birthday
My head hurt, my hands shake trying to hold the phone
No gifts, no cards can ever replace the hurt
For the mess I created when I lost my way
Give me shelter in your loving arms
Help me out on this Christmas day
Once had love but I lost my way
So give me shelter in your loving arms
