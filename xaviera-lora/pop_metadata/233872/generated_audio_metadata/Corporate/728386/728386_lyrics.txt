Ha, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
If it's silent in dismay
It won't break this feeling down
If I conquered this my way
I'd devour, I'd surround
If it hurts you just a little
Then it heals you when it's done
Disappointment is the anchor, resolution is the sun
Oh, oh
