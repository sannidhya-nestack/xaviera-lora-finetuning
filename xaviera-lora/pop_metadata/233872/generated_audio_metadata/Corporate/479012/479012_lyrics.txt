Everyday on the run yeah
Had to swallow all my pride
Waking up all alone yeah
Had no one at my side
Always dreaming about you
Always hold you in the sky
All your love and devotion
I can hold my head up high
I got you dreamin' comin' into my life
Dreamin' comin' into my life
Dreamin' comin' into my life
Been burned on the inside, been holding on my breath
Tears run down my cheek, yeah, had almost nothing left
Got to get on, coming back to my life
Dream on, coming into my life (I got you, got you, got you, got you, got ya)
Dream on, coming into my life
Dream on, coming into my life
The whole way world, world falling apart
Minds going crazy, never know how to stop
Never know what to say or what to do
Where to go, till I found you
Say the greatest D, I'm alive for you my love
Holding on to redemption
Now I wear it like a glove
As I sit and I ponder
And I watch the world go by
Gonna hold up my head
Gonna hold my head up high
Hold it up, yes keep it up there everybody
I got you, got you down
Coming back to my life
Dream on coming into my life
Dream on coming into my life
Dream on coming into my life
Dream on coming into my life
Dream on coming into my life
Dream on coming into my life
Dream on, coming into my life (I got you)
Dream on, coming into my life
Dream on, coming into my (I got you)
