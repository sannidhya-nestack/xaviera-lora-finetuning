Let's get closer (closer, closer)
Let's get closer (closer, closer)
Let's get closer (closer, closer)
Closer
I, I like the way you say that I'm not wasting time
I can't hide, I'm trying not to question our peace of mind
I can say
There ain't no complications
I'm not here to play
Nothing's changed
I'm always searching for your love and I don't feel ashamed
Feel ashamed
I'm always questioning the reason why I try
Alright
I think about you every moment of my life
All I wanna say is I just can't stop trying I don't wanna play
I don't wanna play
I just wanna say
Let's get closer
I'm living every moment I can't take the blame
Let's get closer
I'm telling you my feelings I can't stay the same
Let's get closer
And I just can't stop trying, I don't want the rain
Let's get closer
I'm trying, no denying, I am here to stay
Here to stay
I, I'm listening to your reason it's a brand new day
Time, a blessing there's no question I won't walk away
It's okay, I'm living here without you there's no words to say
Can't contain
I feel the fire, no desire, I'm not here to play
Here to play
You're always sending me the message, not tonight
Alright
I can't deny that you are always on my mind
All I wanna say
Is I just can't stop trying, I don't wanna play
I don't wanna play
I just wanna say
Let's get closer
I'm living every moment I can't take the blame
Let's get closer
I'm telling you my feelings I can't stay the same
Let's get closer
And I just can't stop trying, I don't want the rain
Let's get closer
I'm trying, no denying, I am here to stay
Here to stay
Let's get closer
Let's get closer
Oh let's get closer
Let's get closer
Let's get closer
Let's get closer
Let's get closer
Let's get closer
