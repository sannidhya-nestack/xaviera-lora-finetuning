Here we go, here we go, feel the vibe, let's flow
Energy's electric, let the whole world know
We're rising, no denying, it's the ultimate show
Hands up to the ceiling, yeah, let's go
Yo, it's the anthem, marching to the beat
Heartbeat heavy, feeling thumping in your feet
This is the moment where legends ignite
From the shadows to the spotlight, we're taking flight
No fear, no limits, it's our time to shine
Climbing every mountain we've redefined
Echoes of our dreams now fillin' the streets
We don't stop, no surrender, we can't be beat
Turn it up louder, feel the bassline grow
When the rhythm takes over there's no control
We're unstoppable, invincible in the zone
So chant it with me, this is our home
Here we go, here we go!
From the grit to the glory every step we own
Every scar tells a story of how much we've grown
From the back streets to the main stage glow
We rise with the fire let the flame show
Underdogs turn champs yeah we've earned this crown
Never backing down we're the talk of the town
With a mic in my hand and a beat so tight
I'll turn the volume up make the world feel alive
Hear the echo of the people screaming our name
We're rewriting every rule, breaking the frame
This is passion, persistence, a rhythm divine
Every voice in the crowd saying now's our time
Here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go
Let'em know bro, they ain't ready
They ain't ready (ready, ready, ready)
They ain't ready, they-they-they ain't ready
Let'em know bro
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go
Oh oh oh my god
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh my god
Uh huh (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Here we go here we go
Oh my
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh my
Here we go, here we go
