If it's silent in dismay
It won't break this feeling down
If I conquer this my way
I'd devour, I'd surround
If it hurts you just a little
That it heals you when it's done
Disappointment is the anchor
Resolution is the sun
If it's science in dismay
It won't break this feeling down
If I conquer this my way
I'd devour, I'd surround
If it hurts you just a little
Then it heals you when it's done
Disappointment is the anchor of my soul
The ocean is the sound
