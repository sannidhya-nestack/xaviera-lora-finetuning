We got soul, we got soul, we got soul
We got soul, we got soul
Soul is the principle of life
We got soul, we got soul
Whatever we might think
Whatever we might feel
Whatever we might do
Let there be soul
Whatever we might say, whatever we might feel, whatever we might do, let there be song, let there be song
We are the happy family
Soul is the principle of life
We got soul, we got soul
Whatever we might feel
Whatever we might do
