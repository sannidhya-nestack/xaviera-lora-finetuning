Yeah, yeah, got the rape, yeah
I go to bed, close my eyes, drifting in flight
My ancestors whisper in wisdom in the still of the night
Dreamscape's vivid, stars write the script
While the moon paints prophecies, I tighten my grip
I ain't sleeping, I'm receiving, call it sacred insight
Like I'm reading scrolls lit by the pulse of twilight
DNA memories encoded in dreams
They beam through the seams of subconscious dreams
I seen great grandmama in a robe of light
Said child hold steady you were born to ignite
She passed me a key made of fire and grace
Said unlock your purpose go and take your place
I woke with a breath that could shatter the sky
Eyes wide from the lessons that the spirit supplied
No lullaby just battle cries soft as I breathe
Gave me armor in my sleep so I rise with ease
I go to bed but I wake up lead
Every vision in the night got my soul well fed
It's a legacy I carry never out of my sight
Even when it's pitch black I got vision in the night
I got that vision in the night, my soul taking flight
Yeah, ancestors in the light, whisper truth till it's right
Close my eyes, I ignite, you'll talk to me through the quiet
I go to bed but I rise with a fight
Woke up blessed with the vision in the night (in the night)
Yeah, yeah, nightfall hit, heartbeat slow
But my spirit start dancing where the legends go
They show me symbols, flip scripts like scrolls told me you to like
Even when the world cold now I'm green deep diving
Mind state climbing, truth so sharp I be sleepwalk rhyming
Every night visits like a torch in the dark
Leave the dream with a flame and a fully lit heart
Coated in my breath is the rhythm of time
What they whisper in the dark I bring back in my rhyme
It ain't rest it's a mission
Less transmission soul tuned into the next dimension
So if you see me quiet just know I'm aligning
Power in my veins from the one still guiding
I go to bed but I don't just sleep
I get taught by the deep when the night runs steep
Light up the dark, they speak, I listen
Sleep ain't sleep, it's a holy transmission
Flames in my blood, stars in position
Destiny knocks, I answer the vision
Now I rise like a phoenix from the midnight myth
Every bar that I spit got ancestral twists
They walk through fire, now I walk through fear
With a crown in my chest and a voice so clear
I ain't dreamin' small, nah, I dream with precision
Blueprints handed down, every line's a decision
My great granddad said you were built from the stars
Shooting like comets
Breaking all bars
I don't sleep to escape
I sleep to connect
To a lineage of lions
That demand my respect
So when the baseline drops
And the world gets hyped
Noah's powered by the whispers
That visit me at night
I'm the echo of the past
With a brand new flame
Say my name in the dark
Watch the shadows change
I go to bed
But I don't go blind
I'll be sharpening my soul
In the cradle of time

I go to bed but I rise with a fight
I go to bed but I rise with a fight
Go bed but I walk up blessed with a vision in the night
I go to bed but I rise with a fight
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I go to bed but I rise with a flight, with a flight, with a flight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
