She floats and dances over the sidewalk
Her shimmering hair pure gold from the sun
See you in the market where the people laugh and talk
Just another day of wonder and fun for this girl from Genoa
This girl from Genoa
It's just a beautiful day
Pure gold under the sun
From the city of Rome
To the valleys of Tuscan
Oh it isn't here to stay
Oh it isn't here to stay
For this girl from Genoa
For this girl from Genoa
She smiles at the sky hardly aware
Of all the men who stop and stare
She stops only to buy some fruit
Winks at a couple of men in business suits
For this girl from Barcelona
For this girl from Barcelona
It's just a beautiful day
Golden under the sun
Covers the coast and the bays
Oh it isn't here to stay
Oh it isn't here to stay
For this girl from Barcelona
For this girl from Barcelona
She frogs and plays in the ocean
On another beautiful Italian beach
As people sip their tonic in gin
Just another day of fun in the sun
For this girl from Genoa
For this girl from Genoa
It's just a beautiful day
Pure gold under the sun
From the city of Rome
To the valleys of Tuscan
Oh it isn't here to stay
Oh it isn't here to stay
For this girl from Genoa
For this girl from Genoa
It's just a beautiful day
Golden under the sun
Covers the coast and the bays
Oh it isn't here to stay
Oh it isn't here to stay
For this girl from Barcelona
For this girl from Barcelona
