Running low, it's getting late
Working hard, the pressure's rising
I'm feeling hot, pushing past
All the people, get out of my way
Got it now, there's nothing left
I'm burning out, I keep on driving
Burning up, but mostly
Never show any pain
In this crazy world, you're gonna get nowhere (you're gonna get nowhere)
In this selfish city, you're gonna get nothing (you're gonna get nothing)
You can watch the flames in broken glass
And listen to the folk about it all before (all before)
Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat (you're gonna get nowhere)
Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat (you're gonna get nothing)
Sweat, sweat
Feeling like you're gonna break
Never show any weakness
Pushing down the pressure zone
Starting to feel you're gonna fail
Gotta know there's nothing left
I'm burning out, I keep on driving
Burning out
But mostly never show any pain
In this crazy world you're gonna get nowhere
You're gonna get nowhere
In this selfish city you're gonna get nothing
Take a walk through the flames and broken glass
And listen to the vocal, done it all before
Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat
Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, baby
