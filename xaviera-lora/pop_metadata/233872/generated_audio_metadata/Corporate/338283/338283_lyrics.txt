I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm, I'm, I'm ready
I'm going to leave it at that.
Oh, you're in trouble now
You don't need to put up a fight
I'm gonna be your little bride
I've got ways to make you step inside
I'm gonna pull you from your hiding place
For a sweet soothing into your eggs
My body is a melting wax
I'm inside your looking waiting to explode
So come and step inside my door
Won't hit at you anymore
I think you've got my vice
All right
Oh, you're in trouble now
You don't need to put up a fight
I'm gonna be your little bride
I've got ways to make you step inside
I'm gonna pull you from your hiding place
For sweet soothing into your eggs
My body is melting waves
I'm inside your lurking waiting to explode
So come and step inside my door
Wanna hit and you'll need more
I think you've got my vice
Alright, alright, alright
You're in trouble now you don't
Need to put up a fight
I'm gonna be your little bride
I've got ways to make you step inside
I'm gonna pull you from your hiding place
For a sweet spilling into your eggs
My body is a melting wax
I'm inside your liking waiting to expand
So come step inside my glow
Won't hit at you anymore
I think you got my back, alright
So come and step inside my door
Won't hit at you anymore
I think you got my back, alright
I'm just gonna have to let you go
I'm just gonna have to let you go
I'm just gonna have to let you go
I'm just gonna have to let you go
I've got to get out of here.
