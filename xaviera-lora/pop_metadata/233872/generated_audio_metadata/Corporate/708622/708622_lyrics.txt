I'm holding the rainbow to my eye
Weaving butterflies in my hair
Shimmering lakes fill my sight
As I float a calm rain cloud
I'm smoking some mist atop the hill
The sunlight fills me with music
The trees walk by my side
The sound of the rain is the beat
Do you feel my love all around you
As I gather all your dreams
Do you feel the fragrance around you
As the flowers bloom in your dreams
And dill and bubbles of tots over you
The sun's firm mist to hide your eyes
The stars add white and gold
The sparkle shines, fireflies of the day
Are colored in green and blue
My heart melts along the rivers
My pain lies at the bottom of the oceans
The burst falls in green gold leaves
Do you feel my love all around you
As I gather all your dreams
Do you feel the fragrance around you
As the flowers bloom in your dreams
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Do you feel my love all around you
As I gather all your dreams
Do you feel the fragrance around you
As the flowers bloom in your dreams
Do you feel my love all around you
As I gather all your dreams
Do you feel the fragrance around you
As the flowers bloom in your dreams
