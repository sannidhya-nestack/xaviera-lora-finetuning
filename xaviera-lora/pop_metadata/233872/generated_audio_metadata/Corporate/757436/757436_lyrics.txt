Burning deep in me, my heart is wild
Feeling on my mind that I can't think straight
Desire
Believing me
Fulfilling me
They make me mean, they make me greedy, Jesus, me
Passion keeps me blind but I don't mind
I'm obsessed by possessions of many kinds
These are you
Believing me
Fulfilling me
He gives me desire
He make me be
He make me dream
He chases me
I would kill to own and die to have
He'd rather be mine or we can't stand
Desire
Unleading me
Fulfilling me
Catch me
Keep desire
And make me be
Make me dream
Keep chasing me
