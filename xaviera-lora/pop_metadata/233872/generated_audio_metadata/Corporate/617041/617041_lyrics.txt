You had your reasons, explained them clearly
They didn't really add up to me
You had a vision, I couldn't see it
Of how you wanted your life to be
So you left and travelled far away
Should have swallowed my pride and begged you to stay
Now I'm hoping I can change your mind
But how hard will you be to find?
Because no road leads to where I think you've gone
I'll have to leave the beaten track
And I know some days that the trail will grow cold
But oh how I want you back
So I'll go cross country to find you
I'll go cross country to find you
I will go cross country to find you
And find you I will
I lay awake at night, wondering where you are
Look up in the sky, can you still see our star?
Now you're gone, nothing seems the same
I need you back home again
But no road leads to where I think you've gone
I'll have to leave the beaten track
And I know some days that the dread will grow cold
But oh how I want you back
So I'll go cross country to find you
I'll go cross country to find you
I will go cross country to find you
And find you I will
Yes, I'll go cross country to find you
I'll go cross country to find you
I will go cross country to find you
And find you, I will
Find you, I will
I know I'll find you, I will
I'm gonna find you
