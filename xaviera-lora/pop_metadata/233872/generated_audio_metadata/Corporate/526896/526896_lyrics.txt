A shaft of sunlight beams in through the window
The clock is chiming in the hall
The smell of coffee from the kitchen
Morning's gentle wake up call
I see you lying there beside me
Lips are trying hard to smile
Eyes are practically half open
Been playing possum for a while
I can't think of a better way
To start another joyful day
You're with me that's all I care about
When I wake up with you I'm amazed
Soon we're drinking our first cup of coffee
Breakfast follows pretty close behind
A kiss and a squeeze shows our affection
Our day is underway, what will we find?
I can't think of a better way
To start another joyful day
You're with me, that's all I care about
When I wake up with you, I'm amazed
Every day with you got better as we grew
Closer than we'd ever been before
It seems like just a year since we overcame the fear
And took the plunge in nineteen eighty-four
I can't think of a better way
To start another joyful day
You're with me, that's all I care about
When I wake up with you on a miss
I can't think of a better way
To start another joyful day
You're with me, that's all I care about
When I wake up with you I'm amazed
