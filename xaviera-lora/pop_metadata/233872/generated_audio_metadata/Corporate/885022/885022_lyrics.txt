I'm tired, just on my way
Ready to take off my black coat
Let's dance, I hate to stay
Can I make my own decision?
I'm arrived, let's go, wanna say
I wanna feel it again
Hey, yeah, yeah, I, I can feel it again
Hey, yeah, yeah, I, I can't feel it again
We are here to shine
We are here to shine
We are here to shine
You are unique
I'm coming back, I'm here to shine with my own sparkle
No place for gravity, just the lightness come to me
Now it is clear to see, I'm ready to believe in me
Hey, yeah, yeah, I can feel it again
Hey, hey, yeah
I can feel it again, hey, hey, hey
We are here to shine
We are here to shine
We are here to shine
You are unique
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We are willing to shine (we are willing to shine)
We are willing to shine (we are willing to shine)
We are willing to shine (shine)
We are willing to shine (we are willing to)
We are willing to shine
We are willing to shine (hey yeah)
We are willing to shine (ooh)
