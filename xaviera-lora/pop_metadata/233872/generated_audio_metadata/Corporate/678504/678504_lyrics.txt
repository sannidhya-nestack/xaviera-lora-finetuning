And I see nothing, nothing left to see
And I hear nothing, there's nothing left to hear
All your love, it's vanished like the river
Flown under the bridge of over
In the blue of shame
In the blue of shame
And I feel nothing, nothing left to feel
And I need nothing, nothing left to need
All your love, it dried up like the river
Broken heart, broken now it's over
End of love shine
And I'm full of shine
Yet I wish I could do this again
To feel the sunlight of your love shine bright
And I dream I'd be your love sign
And sleep for eternity
For eternity
And I see nothing, nothing left to see
And I hear nothing, there's nothing left to hear
All your love, it's vanished like the river
Flown under the bridge of over in the blue of shame
And over love shine
And I feel nothing, nothing left to feel
And I need nothing, nothing left to need
All your love, it dried up like the river
Broken heart, broken now it's over
End of love shame
And the wolves shine
