I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am,
This evening I'm feeling so unyielding
I have no control, it's deep in my soul
It's a safe place where it all began
Home, family, more of a plan
I love you more
'Cause I love you more
Why you stay away so long
Together we were always so strong
Giving things not so hard to find
I will give up what I love
Cause I love you more
