(I can't see anything, I can't see anything, I can't see anything)
Count me in, your dreams for life
Count me in, your dreams for life
You and I, you and I
Count me in, your dreams for life
Count me in, your dreams for life
Count me in, your dreams for life
You and I, you and I
Count me in, your dreams for life
Count me in, your dreams for life
Count me in, your dreams for life
You and I
You and I
Can't make it
Your dreams collide
