This ain't the first time
This ain't the last time
This is now and this is forever
Give me your love now
Show me you need me
Give me something
Give me forever
I know you want it
I know you feel it
Let's just start and burn it together
And I'll burn
The world for you and I'll search the ocean blue
Give me something, give me your love now
Give me forever, I know you want it
I need your love now, I wanna be stronger
Don't leave me here now, just give me forever
I'll be your hope
And I'll be somewhere safe tonight
Just give me, give me your love now
Taking me home now
Making me love you from now and forever
Give me your love now
Taking me home now
I'll be everything that you want now
Give me forever
And I'll burn the world for you
And I'll search the oceans blue
And I'll be somewhere safe tonight
