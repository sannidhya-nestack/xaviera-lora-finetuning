Into the dark we go, go, go home
Into the dark we go, go, go
This is not the way that I remember you
But if you follow me, I control you, Louis
We can always become what is you desire
And I can always be myself around you
This is not the way that I remember you
But if you follow me, I can draw you the way
We can always become what is you desire
And I can always be myself around you
Into the dark we break
Won't you turn to me when you're through
Into the dark we go, go, go, go
Into the dark we go, go, go, go
