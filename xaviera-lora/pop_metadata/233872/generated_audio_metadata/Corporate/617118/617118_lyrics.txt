I opened the window this morning
To listen the rain that's falling
Then you take me in your arms
I'm falling too
Oceans I hope that will never change
Na na na na na
You're my little light of love
My heart, my blue world
Close to you
I'm feeling free
Everything's running easily
With you I could not be sad
I want you so bad
I hope that will never, never, never change
You're my life, you're my love, you're my world
I can't live
You're my life, you're my love, you're my world
I can't live
You're my life, you're my love, you're my world
I can't live
My blue wall
