I can use the dirt to make the fire rise
I can use the dirt to make the wood

I can use the dirt, make the fire run
I can use the dirt, do, do, do
I can use the dirt, make the fire run
I am, I, I, I am
Dead, dead, dead
I am used to dead
I am, I am, I am ah
Dead, dead, dead, I hope you're dead
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, ah-ah-ah-ah
Dead, dead, dead, I think he's dead
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, ah-ah-ah-ah
I think you're scared to do it
