Let me drive
I'll drive down this road
I'll drive down these halls
I'll walk low back and forth
Won't tell you where I go
Though I won't come back for you
I'll go down these roads, I won't tell you where I'm going, no, no, no
Let me drive
Let me drive
I won't look back anymore
Won't tell you where I go
Though I won't come back for you
Won't tell you where I go
Though I won't run back for you
