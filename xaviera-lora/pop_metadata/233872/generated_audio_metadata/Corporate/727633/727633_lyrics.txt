Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm a river
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mm
Whoa
Yeah
Ooh
Ooh
If it's silent in dismay
It won't break this feeling down
If I conquered this my way
I'd devour, I'd surround
If it hurts you just a little
Then it heals you when it's done
Disappointment is the anchor of resolution is the sun
Who is there?
Who can help?
Find the way up here?
Come down, down, down, down, down, down
Oh
