Let us set off on this journey
A journey of sound and expression
A sonic adventure
A musical exploration
Through no and unknown lands
We travel through with no solid plans
We document our trips
With song written along way
Exploring the textures and emotions
The journey we will portray
No worry, no pain, no
No worry, no pain, no
I'm gonna get off this dead end street
Kick it, it's gone
You love John
Kick it, it's gone
Kick it, it's gone
Kick it, it's gone
Kick it, it's gone
Kick it, it's gone
Kick it, it's gone
You love John
