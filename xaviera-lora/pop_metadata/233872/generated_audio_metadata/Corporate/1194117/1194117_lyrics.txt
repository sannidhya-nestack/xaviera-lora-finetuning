We walked the London streets together
Walking the crowded streets alone
Not afraid of any future
And walked along a path unknown
A million lights we didn't see
Through older people and a stumbling
So we left familiar places
You looked real enough to me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hey!
A life getting better
That life's getting better
A life getting better
That life's getting better
We walked along the streets together
A sudden chance that must have been
People and time we didn't notice
I'm certain still but not alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We could only feel quite sure of what we'd get
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You can always be quite sure of what you've got
And though our lives were pretty different in those days (our lives getting better)
Although my life seemed pretty simple in those days (that life's getting better)
And though our lives were pretty different in those days (our life's getting better)
Although my life seemed pretty simple in those days (that life's getting better)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Together we'd find a life getting better
Till one day you'll find that life's getting better
