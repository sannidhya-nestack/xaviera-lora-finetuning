I'll be gone next year, fear of the dark night
So that's how we're talking
Hey, I'm in the key now
Let me down, that's how I'm feeling right now
So that's how we're talking
Hey, I'm in the key now
I'll be gone, but I'll be here all night long
S'kola t'a l'fawdi
Hela m'naki l'lil, l'lil, l'lil, y'al, y'al, y'al, y'sha
Kira wadana
S'kola t'a l'fawdi
Hela m'naki l'lil, l'lil, l'lil, y'al, y'al, y'al, y'sha
Kira wadana
For the time of the year
And I will not give up
Let me get on my feet
Here on my garden
For the time of the year
And I will not give up
Let me ask you, did all I've done
For the love of me, and I will not give up
Let me ask you, did all I've done
For the love of me, and I will not give up
