Spending time by the ocean
I make waves of love
Felt in my heart, illusion
I make waves of love
Spending time by the ocean
I make waves of my own
Sailing by on the ocean
I make waves of my own
Spending time by the ocean
I'll make waves of love
Filled in by all delusions
I'll be crippled to love
You'll show me the light
