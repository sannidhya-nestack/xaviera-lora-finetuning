You got the good, the good, those lines
You spend the night alone
You got the good, the good, those lines
You spend the night alone
Do you have to go through those lines until you spend another night alone?
Do you have to go through those lines until you spend another night alone?
Do you rather do it for those eyes
Or do you spend the night alone?
Do you rather do it for those eyes
Or do you spend the night alone?
Too bad that the moon will fall on those eyes
And you'll spend another night alone
Too bad that the moon will fall on those eyes
And you'll spend another night alone
Let the good old blues lines
You'll spend the night alone
Let the good old blues lines
You'll spend the night alone
That the blue blues lines
You'll spend the night alone
That the blue blues lines
You'll spend the night alone
Too bad that those eyes are too spent in the night alone
Too bad that those eyes are too spent in the night alone
