You're not alone
(AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH)
Let my love take you higher, take you higher, baby
Let my love take you higher, take you higher
Higher, higher, let my love take you higher (let my love take you higher, take you higher)
Than you've ever seen before, hey
Higher (I'm like Bob Marley)
Take me higher baby
Can't hold me now
Can't hold me
Can't hold me
Take it higher baby
Take it higher baby
Higher
Higher
Take my love, take it higher, take it higher than you've ever been before
That my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love
