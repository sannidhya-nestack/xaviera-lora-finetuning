It's a new day
It's a new day
I see the world shining in your eyes
I see the world shining with you
I see the world shining in your eyes
I see the world shining with you
I see the world shining in your eyes
I see the world shining with you
I see the world shining in your eyes
I see the world shining with you
We were born to be alive
To feel the wind and the sunshine
We were born to be alive
To feel the wind and the sunshine
Somebody is waiting for you on a new day
Somebody will light up your life in a new way
Somebody is waiting for you on a new day
Your life in a new way
Somebody's waiting for you on a new day
Somebody's waiting for you on a new day
Breathe it all out and breathe in new air
Love is a beautiful sunrise
We were born to be alive
Love is a beautiful sunrise
I see the world shining in your eyes
I see the world shining with you
I see the world shining in your eyes
I see the world shining with you
I see the world shining in your eyes
I see the world shining with you
I see the world shining in your eyes
I see the world shining with you
Breathe it all out and breathe in new air
Breathe it all out and breathe in new air
I see the world shining in your eyes
I see the world shining with you
I see the world shining in your eyes
I see the world shining with you
I see the world shining in your eyes
