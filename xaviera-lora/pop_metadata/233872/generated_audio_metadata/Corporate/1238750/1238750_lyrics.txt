Lay here, right now
New worlds and notions, got dreams in our eyes
In a powerful notion, we're seizing the moment
Reaching for the stars, every challenge we face
We'll break the bars
In the hostile and hostile we find our proof
With every step we take we make our move
From the morning sun to the midnight moon
We're right as four, we will be there soon
Right here, right now, we're unstoppable
With passion burning bright, we're phenomenal
Through the highs and lows, we'll rise somehow
This is our time
Right here, right now
Right here
Right here, right now
Right here, right now
In the chaos and noise, we find our voice
With determination strong, we make our choice
We're shaping our destiny, ing ahead
With every beat of our heart, we'll paint it red
No looking back, no regrets to hold
With courage as our shield, we're bold and bold
We'll conquer the fear, we'll break through doubt
Because right here, right now, we're about to sprout
Right here, right now
We will stop the clock with passion burning bright
the now know who the hearts and those will rise from now
This is our time now
Right here, right now
