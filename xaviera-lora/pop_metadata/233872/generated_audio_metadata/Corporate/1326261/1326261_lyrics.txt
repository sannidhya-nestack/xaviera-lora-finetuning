A whisper floats where shadows sleep
In timeless halls where echoes cling
A thousand strings in sweet refrain
Carry whispers of joy and pain
Oh rise and fall, the tide of time
Softly played in rhythm and rhyme, a symphony
In a fleeting breath
Born of life and kissed by death
Light laces threads of gold
Through autumn winds so shy but bold
Beneath the stars a lone voice calls
The melody bends, it twists, it flies
Through dreaming hearts and endless skies
Though fleeting moments seek to stay
Its beauty sweeps them all away
Oh, rise and fall, the tide of time
Softly played in rhythm and rhythm
A symphony, the fleeting breath
Born of life and kissed by death
Strings of love they kiss the air
The music fades but in our souls it's warmth, it's stay
