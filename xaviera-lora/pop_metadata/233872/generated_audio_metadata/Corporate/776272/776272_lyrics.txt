Whoa, yeah, your love is like a drug, yeah
It gets me so high that I can touch the sky
You make me wanna fly so high and touch the sky
Decisions must be made tonight
Decisions no one can justify
And if you tried to live in my head
You'd see that you'd crumble
You'd just crumble from the sun
Woah, yeah, your love is like a drug, yeah
It gets me so high that I can't touch the sky
You make me wanna fly so high and touch the sky
In time, the truth will be revealed
In time, you won't be mystified
You said you wanna see in my head
And you'll see me
And who I really am
You said you wanna see in my head
And you'll see
That you were just crumble
You just crumble from the sky (you just decelerate high, yeah)
Your love is like a drone, yeah
It gets me so high that I can't touch the sky (decelerate high)
You make me wanna fly so high and touch the sky
[Silence]
