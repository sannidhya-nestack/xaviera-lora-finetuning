In my dreams you could be anything
That's why you can't let me sleep
In my dreams you can't be anything
That's why you can't let me sleep
Tonight
In my dreams you could be anything
That's why you can't let me sleep
In my dreams you can't be anything
That's why you can't let me sleep
Tonight
And it keeps me up at night with you man
That's why I can't sleep
And it keeps me up at night with you man
That's why I can't sleep
