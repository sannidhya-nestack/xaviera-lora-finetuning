Everybody's moving, moving to the beat
In this moment we're feeling the heat
Like some man moved to the beat
In this moment we're feeling the heat
Lights are flashing, colors in the air
We're living for tonight without a care
DJ's spinning tracks that make us feel so right
We're gonna dance until the morning light
This is our time, our party
We're the music style and we're feeling free
Let's come together, but gonna rest in this groove, but feeling our best
On the ground, feel the floor, in this breakdown, let it all go
Hands in the air, we're reaching for the sky
In this moment, we're soaring high
Everybody's moving
Sipping on some drinks, feeling the vibe
With my friends around it's a perfect try
The rhythm's got us moving bodies in sync
In this place we're on the break
Can't even let'em bring
Lights out fashion, colors in the air
We're living for tonight without a care
DJ's spinning tracks that make us feel so right
We're gonna dance until the morning light
This is our time, our party
Where the music's loud and we're feeling free
Let's go together, we're feeling our best
This is our time
