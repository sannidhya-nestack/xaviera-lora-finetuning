We belong in the sky
And I wanna fly, oh, I
I wanna shine, I wanna live what I dream
You and me, we could set the world on fire
We could be the start of a new generation
Oh, we could be love
We could be the light in the dark
You and me, we could make a night sky brighter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We could be like stars in the sky
We could be like stars in the sky
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We could be like stars in the sky
Burning like the stars in the sky
Everybody knows, everybody knows
There's a light inside
We could be stars, oh, oh
We could be stars, oh, oh
We could show the world who we are in the dark
We could shine so bright
We could be stars, oh, oh, oh
Stars, oh, oh, oh
We know who we are, who we are
Turn the music up louder, louder
Make it louder
We know who we are, lighting up the sky
We are the stars, we are the stars
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, we gon' light it up, light it up
This could be the start of a new revelation, oh
Could you believe, could you push your fears all aside?
Or you and me, we could set the world on fire
Close your eyes and just be
We could be stars, oh, oh, oh
Stars, oh, oh, oh
Everybody knows, everybody knows there's a light inside
We could be stars, oh, oh
We could be stars, oh, oh, oh
We could show the world who we are in the dark
We could shine so bright
We could be stars, oh, oh, oh
Stars, oh, oh, oh
We belong in the sky
And I wanna fly, oh, oh
You and me, we can set the world on fire
We know who we are, who we are
Turn the music up louder, louder
Make it louder
We know who we are, lighting up the dark
We are the stars, we are the stars
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, we gon' light it up, light it up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, we all light it up, light it up
Oh
We know who we are, who we are
Turn the music up louder, louder
Make it louder
We know who we are, lighting up the dark
We are the stars, we are the stars
