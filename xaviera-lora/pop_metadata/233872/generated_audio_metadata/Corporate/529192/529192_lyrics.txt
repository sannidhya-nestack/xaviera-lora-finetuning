Forever loved, forever in your arms is where I want to be again
Forever loved, forever in your arms is where I want to be again
Late at night we drift alone
It's all that we have ever known
Still I hear you calling me
And when you find me we'll be free
Just believe in me tonight
Forever loved, forever in your arms is where I want to be again
Forever loved, forever in your arms is where I want to be again
As surely as the sun will rise
And vanish all our darkened sky
You have to find a way to see
Just what it is you mean to me
Just believe in me tonight
Forever loved, forever in your arms is where I want to be again
Forever loved, forever in your arms is where I want to be again
Forever loved, forever in your arms is where I want to be again
Forever loved, forever in your arms is where I want to be
Forever in your arms is where I want to be, again, forever loved, forever in your arms is where I want to be, again, forever loved, forever in your arms is where i want to be, again
Again
