Emotions fill me, fill my head
I don't want to feel empty, do what you said
Passion fills me inside me
'Cause I want you, baby, fulfill me
Yeah, I feel so horny right now
You know why, I know how
I feel so horny right now
So damn horny right now
I, I, I, I, yeah
So dumb, so dumb
Yeah, I feel so horny right now
You know why, I know how
I feel so horny right now
So damn horny right now
Gotta please myself baby, quiet the storm
Don't silence me, baby, just free me
Passion fills me inside me
I want you, baby, fulfill me
Yeah, I feel so horny right now
You know why, I know how
I feel so horny right now
So damn horny right now
I want to save me from myself
But I'm losing control, hold me down
It's my mission to get you beside me
I want you, baby, be with me
Yeah, I feel so horny right now
You know why, I know how
I feel so horny right now
So damn horny right now
So down
Mmmmm
Slow me down
Yeah, hold me down, boy
