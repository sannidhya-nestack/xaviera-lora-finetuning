You don't wanna be alone
Moving on and going home
Let me stand in the rain
I am done with all your games
I can hear you whisper now
It is far but the moon out
Let me stand in the rain
Makes me feel like going sane
You don't wanna be alone
Wanna be alone, moving on and going home
Let me stand in the rain, I am done with all your games
I can hear you whisper now, it is far but don't know how
Let me stand in the rain, makes me feel like going insane
I try
Your touch will be near
I'll lie
For you I'll pretend
I try
I try
You don't wanna be alone
Moving on and going home
Let me stand in the rain
I am done with all your games
I can hear your whisper now
It is far but don't know how
Let me stand in the rain
Makes me feel like I went insane
You don't wanna be alone
Moving on and going home
Let me stay in the rain
I am done with all your games
I can hear you whisper now
It is far but don't move out
Let me stay in the rain
Makes me feel like I'm insane
I can
Hear your whisper, hear your whisper, hear your whisper, hear your whisper now
