That's right
No line
Place lines
First time
I guess I did watch
I guess I did watch
I guess I did watch
I guess I did watch
I guess I did watch
I guess I didn't watch
I guess I didn't watch
I guess I didn't watch the breakdown
So
Life is hard
You're so back in my room alone
Don't worry
You know shit
That's right
What's up?
Like it now?
Oh, yeah
Break time, right?
And why?
Yes, bitch
And why?
Real shit, real wild
Now bring it down, yeah, that's right
You like that, that's right
Real wild, real wild
Let me try to play that chord
With my own fingers without sound
Yeah I can do it
