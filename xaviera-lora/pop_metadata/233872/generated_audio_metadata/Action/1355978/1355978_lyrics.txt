Steel in the dawn, banners unfurled
One man's name commands the world
From Golgamella to distant sands
Empires rise by his bloodied hands
Trumpets cry what angels fear
Glory whispers
Death draws near
Crune of the Dominion
Fire and thunder
The world's desire
From Caesar's blade
To the man-pine keyer
Kings are doors
Beaten by a squire
Crune of
Dawn's already dawned
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Through storm and steel, their legends told
Napoleon's gaze, unyielding cold
From Rome to East, the path is red
Every throne built on the dead
History bleeds from the rider's quill
The gods are silent but the echoes kill
Throne of the Dominion
Fire and thunder, the world's desire
From Caesar's blade to the Mongol pyre
Kings are dashing, empire's choir
Throne of the Dominion
Alexander dreams in marble sleep
While banners rot and oceans weep
No glory lives beyond the grave
Only the names that I will slay
Crune of the Dominion
Burned in triumph, lost in flame
All who rise shall fade the same
Only the silence remembers the name
Corona, Veterinarian
