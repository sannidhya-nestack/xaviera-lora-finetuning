Any way that you want (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Put your foot away, any way that you want (it's about to go down)
We just made that, tell you something (it's about to go down)
Any way that you want
First off let me start off by saying we ain't playing this is serious
Some might call it entertainment
Nine out of ten that's a short we ain't having that
This is how it's going down
Here I'm not no chauvinist
But I gotta take my time and probably gotta show them this
I'm not the one to brag I'ma keep a humble fist
Why you acting out is you mad what you need to do
Take a cap and nick we articulate oil
We can wait till all the lights go down and all them cars go skrrt
There's a guy out in the crowd that's acting wild lifting up his shirt
People go in all different ways nowhere to run cause it ain't safe
It could go any way, uh, any way you want, any way, uh
Any way you want, any which way, ayy, yeah, uh
Saying things like Biggie said
Another day another struggle
Another day I gotta hustle
Another day I gotta juggle
Same thing as Nipsey's rules
Have a plan and keep evolving
Jealousy is a weak emotion
That's a quote straight from Jay
Or we can take it to the point where we stand off
Hands on safety's off sites on go
Shots getting fired in the air
Like it's 4th of July it could go
Any way you want, any way
Any way you want
Any which way ay
Yeah it could go
Any way you want (any way ay)
It could go
Any way you want (look away)
It could go
Any way you want (look away ay)
It could go
Any way you want (look away) (look away) (look away)
We just made that
