I got all this power in my hand
Got the power in my hand
We do this type stuff like everyday
We do this type stuff like everyday
Pull up in the clutch at the last sec
Get up in the air like it's high tech
Straight through the net like a hat trick
Counting paper coming in from practice
Discipline and persevere real quick
Keep this on forever it's a classic
Bought a switchblade out of Minnesota
Flew across the desert just to get some water
La la la la la la (earthquake)
La la la la la (on site)
La la la la la (there's a heartbreak)
La la la la la
I got all this power in my hand
Got the power in my hand
La la la la la la
We do this type stuff like every day
La la la la la la
We do this type stuff like every day
They keep looking at us like it's magic
We be putting work in like a habit
Got a lot of fans like Tasty
Gotta tell me what you really want
Who you are, what you really really want
I can see the pressure in your eyes
Aren't you glad that you made the play right?
Think I'm going left but I'm going right
La la la la la la (burst like)
La la la la la (on site)
La la la la la la (it's hype)
La la la la la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (That's right)
La-la-la-la-la-La (That's right, that's right)
La-la-la-la-la-LA (That's right)
La-la-la-la-la (La)
