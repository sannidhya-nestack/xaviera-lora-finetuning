Twisted like a weeping willow
Fear factor hits the beat
You're feeling lost and you're breathing shallow
Watch your heart just miss the beat
It can hit you like a freight train
Locked and loaded
Your head exploded
You can't take a breath
Until it's too late and you're
Distant to feel
Distant to feel
Distant to feel
Someone's screaming
It echoes in places
Hidden deep inside your mind
I fear twisting and climbing a staircase
It prays for you, a soul to find, find
It can hit you like a freight train
Locked and loaded
Your head exploded
You can't take a breath
Until it's too late and you're destined to feel
Destined to feel
Destined to feel
When your lifeline is binding
Destined to feel
Destined to feel
Destined to feel
And your heartbeat is racing
Just step inside
Into my mind, yeah, yeah
Oh!
Distant to feel
Distant to feel
Distant to feel
When your lifeline is burning
Distant to feel
Like you're limping
Distant to feel
Like you're screaming
Distant to feel
Like you're dying
