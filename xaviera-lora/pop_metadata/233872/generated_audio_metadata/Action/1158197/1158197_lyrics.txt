Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
How do we do it? How do we do it? How do we do it? How do we?
It's the moment that I knew
(I can't help but feel like I'm falling for you, girl)
(I can't help but feel like I'm falling for you, girl)
(I can't help but feel like I'm falling for you, girl)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
