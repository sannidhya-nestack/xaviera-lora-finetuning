Home, home, home
Through the storm and the pouring rain
Every loss, every ounce of pain
The ground shook but I held my place
No retreat
I'm the one they face
Blood and sweat, the battle's tall
But I've got fire deep in my soul
It's the last stand
I'm still alive, it's in the air
I'll rise again, I'm battle bound, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
They said no, I said not today
Climbing mountains, I found my way
Each step forward, I broke the chain
And no defeat, I'll own the game
It's the last stand, I'm still alive
Fists in the air, I will survive
Victory's calling, hear the sound
I'll rise again, I'm battle bound
I fought the dark, I faced the flame
Carved my name in the walls of the game
The fight's not over, it's just begun
I'll stand my ground'til the war is won
It's the last stand, I'm still alive, fists in the air
I will survive
Victory's calling
Hear the sound
I'll rise again
I'm battle bound
Oh, oh, oh
