Open season, and you come out again
I know within you, there's a champion within
Can't find a reason to stop, give it time
Bring some meaning to any doubt that's inside
You are spectacular
You are, you are the one
You are always magical
They are your number one
You are thunder, thunder
You are, you are thunder
You are thunder, thunder
You are, you are thunder
It always has been
Difficult here
But you always knew that
You've got what it takes
Can't find a reason
To stop you this time
Bring some meaning
To any doubt that's inside
Can't find a reason
To stop you this time
Bring some meaning to any doubt that's inside
Can't find a reason to stop you this time
Bring some meaning to any doubt that's inside
You are spectacular, you are, you are the one
You are, your ways are magical, they are, you're number one
You are thunder, thunder, you are thunder
You are thunder, you are thunder, thunder
You are thunder, you are thunder
Can't find a reason to stop you this time
Bring some meaning to any doubt that's inside
Can't find a reason to stop you this time
Bring some need to any doubt that's inside
You are spectacular, you are, you are the one
You are always so magical, they are your number one
