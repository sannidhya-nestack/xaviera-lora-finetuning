It's shadows that rise
In the dust that lies
Where grits and bullets can stay
It's the only way
You're the one who's fault
And none of you are fault
You saved your life coming in the light
You risked my character right
When evil fires flash through my area
You'll be spreadin' out fire
The cigarette scent will wreck the air
And burn you dead to death
Scarfing upon your skin
As it consumes within
It burns past upon your face
And feeds on evil
Bone upon bone, a symphony's morbid
Dog cracks, rests out, as you are unwound
Shreds of flesh, a crimson mesh
Grasping remarks of what's left
Murky walls abandoned with flesh
A grotesque death, blood and flesh
With each pulse, with each gasp
The aura of death's image
