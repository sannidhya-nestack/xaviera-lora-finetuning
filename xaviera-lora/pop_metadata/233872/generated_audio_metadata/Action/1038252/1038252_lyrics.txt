I was riding across the desert seeking shelter from the sun
I stumbled on this two-bed town where the law lived by the gun
And I'd have sold my soul for whiskey
Pushing through those saloon doors into a room
Full of desperadoes wanting to settle the score
And before I even knew it that powder keg was lit
Bullets flying everywhere
I swore that this was it and when the smoke it finally cleared
I was the only one on my feet
So I took that bottle and raised the glass to death
The one I cheated
Oh,'cause it ain't my day, Lord knows it ain't my day
Well, I thought my time had come
But for now that hour's past
It ain't my day, Lord knows it ain't my day
So I'm gonna live like tomorrow
Just might be my last
Well, we're all gonna run out of road someday
Gonna run out of luck
Gonna run out of time when life finally calls your bluff
But that gunfight did its job, you know, just to bring me down to earth
I know there ain't no time to waste, I measure each moment's worth
Oh,'cause it ain't my day, Lord knows it ain't my day
Well, I thought my time had come
But for now that hour's past
It ain't my day, Lord knows it ain't my day
So I'm gonna live like tomorrow
Just might be my last
I see the mountains rise before me
Got the painted sunset sky
The summer breeze upon my face
Ain't it good to be alive?
it ain't my day, Lord knows it ain't my day
Well, I thought my time had come
But for now that I was past
It ain't my day, Lord knows it ain't my day
So I'm gonna live like tomorrow
Just might be my last
Oh, no, it ain't my day, Lord knows it ain't day
Well I thought my time had come
But for now that hour's past
It ain't my day
Lord knows it ain't my day
So I'm gonna live like tomorrow
Just might be my last
