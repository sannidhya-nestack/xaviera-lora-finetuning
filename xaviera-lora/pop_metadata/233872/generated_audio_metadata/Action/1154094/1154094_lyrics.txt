It feels like everyone's walking on eggshells
The slightest crack and everything goes to hell
No second chance, no romance
A sharp decline, like we never shine
It's starting to feel like time ain't on our side
We're outsiders too low for the high life
We're down and out of shot down from the sky
Growing underground
I should have known this was a double cross
It was fun but for you people are props
That I was charm should have been alarm
So much to waste when you value a face
I know where I stand just wait till I get off the floor
We're blindsided, we're not part of the tribe
We're down and out as we used to fly so high
Knocked out before we ever felt a hit
No one warned us it could end so quick
We are underdogs again
But this is not the end
We're outsiders too low for the light, light
We're down and out of shot down from the sky
Why'd you have to turn so malevolent?
We'll be back and you're gonna pay for it
We are underdogs again
We are underdogs again
But this is not the end
This ain't how it ends, no
We are underdogs again
Yeah yeah yeah
We are underdogs again
