Running through the night, chasing every light
Darkness on my side, victory is mine
Whispers in the air, tension everywhere
Heartbeats sinking more, one last final stare
In the shadows we play, under stars that gray
Feel the rush embrace, this is our top parade
Battles in the field
Our fate is sealed
Sweat and tears combine
Through the dark we shine
In the shadows we play
Under scars and grey
Feel the rush embrace
This is our dark parade
This is our jump parade
Echoes of the game
Never be the same
Through the fire we go
In the dark we grow
Whispers in the air
Tension everywhere
Heartbeat sinking more
One last final stare
In the shadows we pray
On the stars and grey
Feel the rush embrace
This is our dark parade
This is our dark parade
This is our dark parade
Rain
In the shadows we play
Under stars of grey
Feel the rush of grace
This is our dark parade
In the shadows we blow
On the stars we play
Feel the rush it wastes
This is our dark parade
