Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But is this rage inside of me?
Darkness kills, can't let it be
Distorted dreams and hollow screams
Ripping through my soul it seems
What is this rage inside of me?
Darkness fills, can't let it be
Distorted dreams and hollow screams
Ripping through my soul it seems
Hold on tight, it's gonna break
To feel the ground begin to shake
Lost in shadows, fight the pain
Rips and tears all withering
Can you hear the valley screaming fate?
Pigeon hay bearers suffocate
Thunder roars inside my veins
Every snap ignite the flame
Hold on tight, it's gonna break
Feel the ground begin to shake
Lost in shadows like the pain
Rinse and tear, fall with the rain
Help, help'cause all the tortured pasts (help)
those ain't never asked (help)
They better break the chains and do the kill (yeah)
Face to face, solid pride to be the last
One's that never do their best
Strive to fear and show the truth
Straddle up, I got the roof
Hold on tight, you're gonna break
Feel the ground begin to shake
Lost in shadows, fight the pain
Rinse the tears off with the rain
Feel the ground, feel the ground, feel the ground
Feel the ground, feel the ground, feel the ground
Pull the dike in, to the face
