The drums kick in with a fast, short beat, 4-5-0-4-5
Morning light, I'm on my way
Defying doubt, I've seized the day
Ways and trails I won't conform
Fueled by fire, I'm better reborn
My own path, my own fight
Living fast, living right
No regrets, just my life
In the dark I'll find the light
Hey, hey, hey, I'll find the light
Faces fade but I remain
Through the storm, through the pain
Unstoppable, I'll never break
With every step, the ground will shake
My own path, my own fight, living fast, living right
No regrets, just my life, in the dark I'll find the light
My own path, my own fight, living fast living right
No regrets, just my life, in the dark i'll find the light
Rising up I stand tall
Through it all
I won't fall
My own path
My own fight
Living fast
Living right
No regrets
Just my life
In the dark I'll find the light
My own path
My own fight, living fast, living right
No regrets, just my life
In the dark I'll find the light
