In shadows of the ghetto
Go where mortals cannot speak
The wrath within my marrow
Soul of fury, no soul weak
Unleash the beast and raise the night
The battlefield is mine
No mercy found within my sight
It darkened, I should fight
Rising from the grave
I've turned
Feel the rage, I say
In shadows of the catacomb where mortals dare not speak
The wrath within my marrowed soul
The fury of the wings
Unleash the flames and raise the night
The battlefield is mine
No mercy, dwell within my sight
In darkness, I should die
Ratchet up the crack or two
Feel the rage
I'm dead
Raging from a thousand screams beneath my skin
The world must be inside
From deep within the pain begins
Nowhere left to hide
The chains that held my spirit
Fell, shattered, now I rise
With every strike of thunderous sound
No more cover of light
Rising from the grave, I'm dead
Feel the rage, I'm dead
Echoes of my past mistakes
Fuel the fire in nights of pain
Seal results my mind's ways
No more trembling fear
Reaching affection is through
Darkness is my only help
Unleash the beast
Reclaim the hell
My vengeance
Free me of the grave
I've turned
Free of the rage
I've turned
Bloodshot eyes and teeth and ash
My grip will never yield
Get clipped soon
The sky turns ash to darkness
I am sealed
My soul's a stone looked on the roof
Collateral damage, glaze
No redemption, I've been coldly tormented
I am free
Rising from the grave
I'm free
Feel the wrath
The fury shining every face, my wrath forever sealed in vengeance, I am reborn in darkness
I am drowned with this new blood, the world will fall as I am the king of snares, from the grave, I've turned
Feel the rage, I did
