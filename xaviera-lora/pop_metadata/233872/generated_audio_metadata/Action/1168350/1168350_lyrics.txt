Revenge!
Trees of fire attack you!
Revenge!
Your head will blow, send the body with the pain, take the world to the top
They would make you evil and you would be returned out of earth.
Traitors are falling to the ground
I'm a shit-load of shit, I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit, I-I'm a shit-load of shit,
Your anger will send the body of clay shaking to the ground
For your son is to dispose
When this work is over, they will be returned unpunished
