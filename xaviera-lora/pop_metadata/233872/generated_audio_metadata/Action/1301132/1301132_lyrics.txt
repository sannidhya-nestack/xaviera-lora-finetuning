You can't understand it, I'm not from this planet
I was playing Godbody before I played the bandit
Now we elevate gravitational from magnets
I made this verse here, sitting in the Tracy Mansion
Astral projection, check the over standing
Let me finish what I'm saying, do not interrupt my landing
You will never ever stop what the forces are planning
You get goby from the left to the right, we're surrounded the planet
365 .25, respawn, come back, fly like a new God
Read between the lines, elevated, I'm divine
I ain't toking on that shh shh shh, I'm sipping on some wine
I'm suspicious of the lies, religion
I swear I'm so suspicious of them guys
I'm a rebel on the rise
I am free, I am five, one of a kind
Shining the night, I'm the dark and the light
I'm a champion, standing on my own in this zone
I'm a champion, it's all up in my dome, that's my throne
I'm a champion, I ain't gotta go, I'm in my home
I'm a champion (what), I'm a champion (what), I'm a champion
Standing on my own in this zone
I'm a champion, it's all up in my dome, that's my throne
I'm a champion, I ain't gotta go, I'm in my home
I'm a champion (what), I'm a champion
I rock'cause I'm hot and I pop like a Glock
I get guap on the block, these bitches catch for the cock
I'm a lot, can't you see me rising up to the fade?
When I top, I'm taking over in this hip-hop game
I'm like a kingfisher, kookaburra, I'm snapping you snakes
The prince of thieves, bow arrow shooter, aim for the face
You better get out of the way, I flood your town like a wave
Gang will hit your girl hard like a runaway freight train
I live in the third lane, your bitch is a hurt lane
The way she nibbles cock, we nickname her a third brain
You wanna battle me, I'll make you suffer the hard way
You can't say I ain't the hardest in this state
Your rhymes stink, bro, like you're brushing with butt paste
You and your boy yapping is a sign of the wrong plane
I hit you with two ways
Chop the legs and the head
And leave your torso stuck in a suitcase
I make a honor kill and look softer than souffle
I'm hard, I'm game, I'm war, I'm pain
I'm the one leaving all the war zones
Full of bones and blood stains
I'm a champion, standing on my own in this zone
I'm a champion, it's all up in my dome, that's my throne
I'm a champion, I ain't gotta go, I'm in my home
I'm a champion, I'm a champion, I'm a champion
Standing on my own in this zone
I'm a champion, it's all up in the dome, that's my throne
I'm a champion, I ain't gotta go I'm in my home
I'm a champion, I'm a champion
