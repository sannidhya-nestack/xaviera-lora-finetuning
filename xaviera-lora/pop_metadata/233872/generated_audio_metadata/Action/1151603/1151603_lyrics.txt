Love thy neighbour, the bible says
But I need a gift to protect myself
Thou shalt not kill, the bible says
But I have the right to defend my wealth
I will kill you when I need
I'll take away your very seed
Guns don't kill people with guns
Kill people with guns
They get what they deserve
The Lord give in
The Lord take us away
