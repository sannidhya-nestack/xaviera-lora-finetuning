Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The love we're dancing close under the neon lights
In your eyes, there's a glow setting the night on fire
Move your body close to mine, baby hold me tight
This rhythm's taking us higher
Oh baby dance with me
Feel the rhythm set us free in the moonlight
Just you and me in this tropical fantasy
With your whisper soft in my ears sweet as a melody
Your heartbeat syncs with mine it's our subsympathy
Under the palm trees sway we let the world fade away
Enveloped in this tropical serenade
Oh set the night ablaze in our dance lost in a daze
Under the starlight caught in the haze
This tropical love we'll always chase
Lost in the music in this paradise
It touches intoxicating oh so nice
Caribbean rhythm under disguise
This moment forever in our eyes
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let's keep the rhythm alive
As we dance into the dark in the moonlight
Just you and me in this tropical fantasy
The distance of the land and sea
In this tropical fantasy your love is mine
This rhythm of ours that feels so divine
In this dance of love forever we shine
With your whisper soft in my ears sweet as a melody
Your heartbeat syncs with mine it's our six symphony
Under the palm trees sway we let the world fade away
Enveloped in this tropical salmonade
Under the palm trees sway we let the world fade away
Enveloped in this tropical salmonade
Enveloped in this tropical salmonade
Our love is mine
This rhythm of ours that feels so divine
In this dance of love forever we shine
I've been in need
Of a rhythm of ours
A rhythm of life
A rhythm of life
Lost in music in this paradise
Two touches intoxicating all so nice
Caribbean rhythm under the skies
This moment forever in our eyes
Oh, let's keep the rhythm alive
As we dance into the dive in the moonlight, just you and me
In this tropical fantasy, with this dance of love and a sea
In this tropical fantasy, your love is mine
This rhythm of ours that feels so divine
In this dance of love forever we shine
