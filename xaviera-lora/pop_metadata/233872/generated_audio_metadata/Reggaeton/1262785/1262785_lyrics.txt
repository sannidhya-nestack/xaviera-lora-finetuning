She's under those neon lights
Moving like the ocean wave
The rhythm's hypnotizing
I'm a captive to her wave
Her whispers to the rhythm
Rolling like a drum beat
Lost in the dance feel the tropical heat
Skin against skin
We move the melody
It's a serenade of passion
Our private symphony
Shaking up the night with her rhythmic craze
She's my tropical crease at the stage ablaze
Moving to the music caught in the haze
Swaying with the tempo in delightful maze
Moonlight in her eyes, the rhythm doesn't lie
Together on the dance floor, under the sky
Her essence enchanting, her moves oh so fine
This rhythm make a love story, it's a time, time (time)
Bouncing to the beats, feel the bass, baby night
Tropical affection, under the starry night
Her moves casting shadows, oh what a sight
This isn't just love, it's a dance done right
She light it up with rhythm and grace
I dance in the moonlight, love written on her face
Reggae beats faded, she's won this race
In this rhythm of love, I found my place
Shaking up the night with her rhythmic craze
She's my tropical queen, set the stage ablaze
Moving to the music, caught in the haze
Swaying with the tempo in delightful maze
Moonlight in her eyes
The rhythm doesn't lie
Together on the dance floor
Under the sky
Her essence in shadows
Her moves oh so fine
This rhythmic love story
Intertwined in time
As the night ends
With her rhythm and grace (ah)
I dance in the moonlight, love written on her face (on her face)
Reggae beats fading, she's won this race (won this race)
In this rhythm of love, I found my place
