We're in it to the summer heat
Your body's moving to the beat
If we're on the sandy street
The rhythm is so sweet
The sunset paints us in a glow
The night is ours and we know
This melody has a flow
Like the ocean waves help them flow
Dancing under the moon too soon
In this rhythm we're a synced up tune
The night's alive as our moving feet
To the rhythm of our hearts so this beat is neat
In the city, under the lights
The vibe just simply ignites
With you here everything feels right
Feet lifting, pure flight
Drums beating, it's no surprise
Look into your tropical eyes
Our language, the hypnotize
Our dance, it's our guise
On this darkest sky, oh my
Swaying to this rhythm high
The night gleams as we twist and twirl
Within this music our emotions unfurl
The taste of freedom feels surreal
This rhythm of love has its appeal
Time forever still what a thrill
This rhythm our hearts will fill
Caught in the rhythm, lost in the beat
Your eyes, the stars, oh ain't this sweet
Under the canvas of this night
Our dancing souls, oh what a sight
As the night turns into day
The music fades away
But in our hearts the rhythm will stay
In this dance, in this play
We found our way together in this rhythmic ballet
Together in this rhythmic ballet
