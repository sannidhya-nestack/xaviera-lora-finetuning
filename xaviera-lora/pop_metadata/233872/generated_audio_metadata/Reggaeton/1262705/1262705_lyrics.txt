Underneath the neon lights your eyes they glow
Steal the show moving on the dance floor slow
Glitter in the air while the wind do blow
Exotic beats where we to go
Turn it off let it bump let the music play
Salty breeze, moment's ease, come let's sway (sway)
Tomorrow's far, we're right here today
In the urban paradise, losing our way (way, way)
With the rhythm, our bodies collide
Under the stars, no secrets to hide
Tropical dreamscape on a wild ride
This dance of desire cannot be denied
Through the city, under the moon's gleaming ray
Dancing to the rhythm in our own stylish way
Heat of the moment making hearts stray
In this game of love, who dares to play?
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Through the world around us, lost in the noise
In the rhythm we found our voice
This dance, this feeling, we made a choice
To surrender to music, that timeless voice
Through melodies, through pristine sound
In the rhythm we are bound
In the city lights where love is found
The music plays on round and round
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
With the rhythm, our bodies collide
Under the stars, no secrets to hide
Tropical dreamscape on a wild ride
This dance of desire cannot be denied
Pure city, under the moon's gleaming ray
Dancing to the rhythm in our own stylish way
Heat of the moment, making hearts stray
In this game of love, who dared to play?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
