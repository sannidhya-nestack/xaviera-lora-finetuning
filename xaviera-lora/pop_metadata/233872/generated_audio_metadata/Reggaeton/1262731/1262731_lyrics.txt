Beneath the heat of the summer sun, girl don't you feel the rhythm?
Foundry swaying, bodies laying on the beach we're giving
Throwing away all of our worries lost in the ocean hue
Your golden skin, your radiant smile
Everything's better with you
Got my heartbeat sinking to the beat
The sand beneath our feet
Your eyes sparkle brighter than the summer sky
With you it's a paradise, oh my
Dance with me under the moonlight
In this tropical vibe, feel just right (just right)
Move your body, lose control
Let the rhythm take your soul
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my
Fancy and cocktail sense reflecting in your shades
Caught up in this rhythm could be lost in it for days
Music's pulse is in our veins, our bodies tingle tight
This pulsing beat, our dancing feet will chase the endless night
Dancing close under the stars, feeling the rhythm, no matter where we are just
Let go, feel the flow and the music will lose control
In the neon night, the world takes flight
Move into a beat that feels so right, with every step we're free
Caught up in this tropical spree
Oh my, dance with me under the starlight
This rhythm, this vibe, it's alright
Lose control, let the rhythm take your soul
This is the moment, let the good times roll
Tropical night and so we dance'til the dawn
Under this summer sun, our beat will carry on
Online
Carry on
