In the city glow under stars so bright
Feel the rhythm slow in the soft moonlight
Caught in a dance where the heart beats warm
In the night entrance we found our home
Step by step
We're dancing to the sunrise, chasing dreams
Dancing under the night skies in this love
There's no wrong or right, just me and you
Lost in the tropic night
(Feelin' alright, feelin' alright)
Frozen sand beneath, waves kissin' our feet
Closer we reach where the sky and the sea meet
Breathin' this moment with salt in the air
Feelin' so potent, a moment we share
Step by step
We're dancing to the sunrise
Chasing dreams
Dancing under the night skies
In this love
There's no wrong or right
Just me and you
Lost in the tropic night
This rhythm it's taking control
Melodies fill our soul
In a world that seems so unreal
It's just you me and how we feel
