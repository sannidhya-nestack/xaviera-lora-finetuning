Did you ever have a wish for a girl who could inspire
A ten thousand years itch of her heart desire
Well let me introduce you please to a girl who fits the bill
I think she took the little red pill
She's a sight to see in this money
Smile worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She struts in her high heel shoes
Her life's gotten better, she got everything to lose
Fashion, so fly, I had to get an airplane seat
At what cost? Lost a pretty penny, come and get some
Would you like a little treat?
Turning heads everywhere, trust me
There are very, very many
She's a little more than filthy rich, one tough bitch
Welcome to the sweetness
Oh miss money, you insist it's sweet honey
It's a thing that you adore miss money
Now you got a little, would you like a little more?
Miss money, sweet little honey
I can see that you are faxed, take a minute
Check your mobile, tell me if you got my text
Flexible, finessin' I can see that you've been messin' with some things I think you think that you've never seen before
She's got a wallet that is quite the little fatty
Generous she is very very very catty
Buying up the love it's something that she can't ever seem to get enough
Of a swipe of a card like to play the part
Crashin' it very hard in the market for a heart
Own this money
You're a fantasy
I think about you everyday
I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person
To a person in your life
Maybe you're a girlfriend
Maybe you're a wife
Miss money, oh she's no dummy
Buys love, but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of greed in her eyes
She's a fiscal fairy, fluttering by
She's got a stock pile of sweet admirers
They're all just the assets that are fueling her desires
She trades her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment, not selling just a pocket
Her laughter rings like a cash register chime
Her love's a currency she can't seem to mine
A portfolio of hearts, a one-up portfolio
But the dividends of love she'll never really know
Miss Mommy, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Miss Mommy, you're a fantasy
I think about you every day
I wonder if you will ever be
It's in the deep freeze, buttering by
A market of romance, she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold, they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh, how she'll spend to seize
She's a penny pincher with a golden touch
But the cost of love, it seems too much
Miss money, oh, the irony's not lost
Can't budget for love
It's an endless cost
If now she bankrupt in the market of hearts
A fiscal failure
Torn apart but oh Ms. Money
You are still a sight in the cold hard cash of the night
Ms. Money, oh, oh, oh
Ms. Money you're a fantasy
I think about you everyday
I wonder if you will ever be seen a deep freeze
Fluttering by
So here's to this money, the bell or the ball, may your assets be liquid
