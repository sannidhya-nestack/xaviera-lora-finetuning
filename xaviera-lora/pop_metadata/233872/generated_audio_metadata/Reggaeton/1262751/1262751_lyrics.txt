The beat the palm trees where the ocean breeze blow
Sip them on tequila while you're dancing real slow
Every time I see it, the sun in your eyes got me hypnotized
Get the night feeling so high
We're dancing in the moonlight, high to light
Moving to the rhythm of a sunny night
Your body's close to mine, just right
On this beach under the stars, love taking flight
Got that sun kissed skin, oh you got that glow
In your denim shorts, baby we're on the show
Our bodies move in tune with the Caribbean tides
With the notes of love where the passion resides
We're dancing in the moonlight, it just feels right
With the gentle sway of the warm night
In the rhythm of the love we share so bright
Beat the melody of us
Captured in the night, in the moonlight
It just feels right
With the gentle sway of the moonlight
In the rhythm of the love we share so bright
Beat the melody of us
Captured in the night
Take my hand let's lose control
In this paradise let's free our soul
A night to remember a story to be told
In this rhythm of love let our hearts unfold
We're dancing in the moonlight, under the moonlight
To this rhythm, oh, it feels just right
As we sway to the beat, holding each other tight
In this dance of love, in the warmth of night
In this paradise, where the love is pure
Under the starlit sky, we're finding our cure
A dance of love that will always endure
In this rhythm, our love remains secure
Got that sun-kissed skin, oh you got that glow
In your denim shorts, babe you're on the show
Our bodies move in tune with the Caribbean tides
With the notes of love, where the passion resides
We're'neath the palm trees where the ocean breeze blow
Sipping on tequila while you're dancing real slow
Our bodies move in tune with the Caribbean tides
With the notes of love, where the passion resides
We're dancing in the moonlight, it just feels right
With the gentle sway of the warm night
In the rhythm of the love we share so bright (so bright)
But they know that the of us
Captured in the night (in the moonlight)
It just feels right
With the gentle sway of the warm night
In the rhythm of the love we share so bright
This melody of us
Captured in the night (in the moonlight)
Light, light, light, light
In this rhythm, oh it feels just right (light in the moonlight)
Light, light, light, light
In this rhythm, I love it
