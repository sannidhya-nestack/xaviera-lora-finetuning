Feel the rhythm in your veins
And the music's set you free
Lost in the rhythm
Where we're meant to be
Underneath the pale moonlight
Dancing out in the street
Your body's moving close to me
Can't resist the heat
Lonely night turns into the day
Dancing our fears away
In the rhythm our bodies sway
Living for the play
Exotic beat under the city light
A love burning so bright
We're caught in a moment
Applying to the world outside
All that matters is here
No need to hide
In the rhythm we find sweet bliss
Your lips, a taste I can't resist
From dusk till dawn we sway
In the rhythm we lose our way
In this tropical wonderland we're gonna stay
No words are needed when our hearts collide
The music speaks for us as we ride this tide
As the sun rises under the blushing sky
A reggaeton story, a love so high
Lonely nights into the day
Dancing all fears away
In the rhythm, our bodies sway
Living for the play
Exotic beat under the city light
A love burning so bright
We're caught in a moment
Blind to the world outside
All that matters is here, no need to hide
In the rhythm we find sweet glitz
Your lips
A taste I can't resist
From dusk till dawn we sway
In the rhythm we lose our way
In this tropical wonderland
We're gonna stay
I'm gonna stay
Run through the city night
A love burning so bright
A love burning so bright
From dusk till dawn we sway
In the real that we lose our way
