Come and feel the beat of the little bodies
We ain't dancing under the stars'til the tropical heat
Palm trees swaying, music playing loud
Underneath the moon, silver shroud
Get up and dance, take the rhythm's chance
Let the music guide you, let it enhance
No looking back, let your worries unpack
In the rhythm of the night, there's no need for a backtrack
The world's a waste, the melody it paves
Under the stars is where our hearts rave
Swing into the tempo, under the moon's glow
This night is magic, don't you feel the flow?
And the night feels young, our song is on
Underneath the stars, our bodies are strong
Just feel the music, don't let go
Our rhythm, it dance the best show
Girls over me, feel the heat
Dancing with you, it feels so sweet
With every note, you start to flow
In this night rhythm we devote
To this melody, to this tropical vibe
In the rhythm of the night we feel alive
Hand in hand under this scarlet sky
With this rhythm our spirits fly
So as the night fades let the memories parade
In our hearts this rhythm is forever played
Don't bother act like your worries unpack
Give'em rhythm of the night
There's no need for a backtrack
The moon's ablaze
The melody paves
Under the stars is where our hearts rave
Swing into the tempo
Under the moon's glow
This night is magic
Don't you feel the flow?
When the night feels young
Our song is sung
Underneath the stars
Our bodies are strung
Just feel the music
Don't let go
Our rhythmic dance
The best show
Feel the beat, feel the heat
Dancing with you, it feels so sweet
With every note, we start to flow
In this night rhythm we devote
Through the night fades, let the memories parade
In our hearts this rhythm is forever played
