Viden as a etna in the moonlight
Lost in your eyelids that shine so bright
With the warm London sound of the ocean tide
In this tropical dream there's no place to hide
Feels like we're dancing through the night
Under the stars that shine so bright
Moving our bodies through the calming symphony
In this perfect rhythm, we're setting free
Your silhouette dances, strokes the night
Speech to my soul, sets it alight, alight
Your laughter is a melody
That sings with the rhythm and dances with me
Shine on, we're dancing through the night
Underneath the pale moonlight
The music flows, I'll wave upon the sea
In this paradise we are free
Being the rhythm, feeling the glow
What could be, we're letting go
Take my hand, let's dance into the sunrise
In the magic of this island paradise
In the rhythm of the night, illuminated bright
Under the moon, we're dancing light as kite
In the soft sand, beneath the swaying palm trees
Together in this paradise, we're free
Your silhouette dancing, strokes the night
Speaks to my soul, sets it alight, alight
Your laughter is a melosis, strokes the night
Speaks to my soul, sets it alight in the soft light
We're such a rhythm with a mind
Two hearts lost in time
And the rhythm so divine
Your silhouette dancing strokes the night
Speaks to my soul, sets it alight
In the soft of the bonnet seats
With the rhythm, rhythm and ice
Two hearts lost in time, you're in the rhythm
So divine, you're in the rhythm
So divine, you're in the rhythm
Feeling the calm of sea
I'm the rhythm, the heat, I'm the rhythm of the moonlight
People that live the move
Lost in your eyes that shine so bright
You're letting go, don't let
The warm undertones of the ocean hide
You are high and tired
In this tropical dream there's no place to hide
Feelin' the rhythm, feelin' the glow
With the beat we're letting go
Take my hand let's dance into the sunrise (sunrise)
In the magic of this island paradise (paradise)
In the magic of this island paradise (paradice)
In the rhythm of the night, illuminated bright
