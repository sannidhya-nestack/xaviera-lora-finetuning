Animation, be me a bitch
Your laughter rings, if you are sick
The Latin rhythm flows, feel the pulse in the sand
Hold my hand, let's flee to a distant land
Move, just move, feel the rhythm inside
In this dance, in this beat, let's take the ride
Love, just love, under the moonlight shine
In this melody will you forever be mine?
Move your steps in the sand, they echo in the night
With each beat of the drum, you're my only sight
Dancing on the palm trees where the ocean meets the land
Under the cosmic tapestry led by your gentle hand
Swirl, just swirl in a rhythm so bright
In this song, in this beat, love takes flight
Dancing under palm trees where the ocean meets the land
Under the cosmic cactus tree led by your gentle hand
Swirl, just swirl in a rhythm so bright
In this song, in this beat, love takes flight
Groove, just groove under the stars divine
In this dance of love let our hearts intertwine
All of them are so sweet in the dance of night
In each move, in each sway of my delight
Riders of the sunset, in your eyes they shine bright
Let's get lost in the rhythm, in the tropical night
Dance, just dance under the twilight's design
With every beat, with every rhythm, your love is mine
In the melody of the night, under the moonshine
In this dance of love forever, will you be mine?
