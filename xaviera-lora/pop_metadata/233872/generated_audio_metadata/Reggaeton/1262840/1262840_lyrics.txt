I'm the best at this and you did it for us
So quick to start the night
Feel the rhythm as time
Skipping to the tropical vibes
Riding on it
It's all cooling
Energy starts to rise
Tonight
On this rhythm we come alive
In the moonlight
Your beauty shines so bright
No words needed, our bodies synchronized
Feeling high, yeah, it feels so right
Your touch, electric like the summer sun
Falling for the rhythm, away we run
Swing and sing to the beat of the drums
Tonight, electric like the summer sun
Falling for the rhythm, away we run
Swing and sing to the beat of the drums
Tonight, tonight, on this rhythm we count my life
In the moonlight
Drunk and we shine so bright
No one's sleeping but you're sneaking tonight
Feeling high, yeah
It feels so right
Drunk, that's alright, yeah
I'll touch in the rhythm of the nightlife
In the moonlight your beauty shines so bright
No words needed our bodies synchronized
Feeling high, yeah it feels so right
It feels so right
Your touch, electric like the summer sun
Falling for the rhythm, away we run
Swaying in sync to the beat of the drums
But tonight
Your touch, electric like the summer sun
Falling for the rhythm, away we run
Swaying in sync to the beat of the drums
Feeling high, yeah it feels so right
Tonight, on this rhythm we come alive
In the moonlight (moonlight)
Your beauty shines so bright (so bright)
No words needed, our bodies speak in the night (speak in the night)
Feeling high, yeah, it feels so right (it feels so right)
In this dance in the rhythm of the night
Caught in the dance, it feels so right
Under the stars we share the sight
In this dance in this magical night
In this dance in the rhythm of the night
Caught in the dance, it feels so right
Under the stars we share the sight
In this dance in this magical night
