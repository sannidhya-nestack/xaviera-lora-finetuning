Still my drunken mumblings and far too many lewd fumblings
Have got me stumbling round in a constant circle of motion
I get this sudden notion this is endless
Eternity entwined in the figure of H .A.
Wondering why these days your mind's so fleeting
I hopscotch through the void avoiding all the asteroids
My random action navigator is always got to be deployed and enabled
Time to turn the tables these terrible turd table terrorists
Telling the truth through far too many of these false fables
Hypnotic like this cyclic nodding
At a cryptic clock
Countdown timer started
How much longer will the melting pot
Of hot shot pot what not
Serial slags with no drops
Benefit cheats and all of our leaders
Rain on all the week
I find it hard to speak my throat
Closing up with all of the anger that I'm feeling
I'm still searching
For any kind of lies, little meanings
I'm dreaming of a better day
And a better way
To try and express myself
And all the stupid things I say
Someone will never know all we've been through
We feel to be a child of the sun and never proud to despise everyone
So every time we flow over well I never feel back up and run
When they see us that far I a come someone will never know
But we feel to be a child of the sun and never proud to despise everyone
So every time we flow over well I never feel back up and run
When they see us that far I a come
They stay bad
I dat dem call I man
Dem can't stand me twen me happy
Young go hard dem understand
So here I am
Alone in the belly of the beast
At least me have me love and me peace
This ain't war here
No matter with your white pillow she come and see it
Young man like me are the only man will do it
When I tell her stuff alright cause you best
Information overload, the overlord of the wonders that you heard and saw
I may be a little raw but I seem somewhere but I'm not drowny
There is not a rust in your candle if it drown me
Pussy clad, don't risk the wrath of this highly strong young after years
But like glitter behind your gears, better run off not too many beers
And among your mates hear me singing songs of glory
So sing along, don't ignore us
So how we never know how it feel to be a child of the sun and never grow to despise everyone
So every time we flow, grab a lot'nem off, we pack up and run
When'em see us, that's where I a gone
So how we never know how it feel to be child of the sun and never grow to despise everyone
So every time we flow, grab a lot'nem off, we pack up and run
When'em see us, that's where I a gone
Someone who'll never know, oh
It feels to be a child of the sun
And never learn to despise everyone
Soon every time we flow, oh
Hell on them off if I come and run
When them see us the far I'll come
Who rattled your cage
Most bitters nowadays don't act their age
Their talk is flawed when tracks are laid
Unsure on beats don't back their case
And I'm bored of the beast fleet jacking my grade
Apes stashed in my grey slacks
Never let Babylon take that
Take back knowledge never waste that
Stay trapped in the wasteland
Tame maintaining the same man
We curse for serving his pay down
Cause your pay down tax every day that you slave and
Never really get fully told where it goes
Do you know
Do you shake hands? Do you research? Check with a straight line
Or pick the pieces up just to play hand
Shaitan the devil is a play man
Dressed back the same as me and you using the same mask so
I keep my mind on my music and try not watching the slime make movements
Stay high like I'm roofing on cloud nine fighting illusion strive for improvement
And bring heat no fire in the booth thing
Fire up the booth when I'm lighting a zoop ring
Life to the room like lights on a meeting
Get wise or get moving
Get wifed up with routines
Do what you're duking but don't judge me
You're the cyphers I'm moving
I won't judge you let's climb through the movement
Check the blueprints, two-two's time is a vital inclusion, a vibe of the truthful
New tunes are revival to you, new tune, new life has arrived
And the route through roads that arrive where the times that'll move you
And politicians make their mind up for you, prove nothing when they slide in the troops
Too smooth, coup's over, moving the coca
Not the soul of the shit you sniff at the quota
You're picked for the vultures that pick at the culture
Quick blitz then a kick on the sofa
Then back to the mix with a click on the roast
The first to breathe burns to the sins that oppose us
How I feel to be a child of the sun and never grow to despise everyone
So every time they flow I will lock them off, back up and run
When they see my step far I have come, someone will never know
How I feel to be a child of the sun and never grow to despise everyone
So every time they flow I will lock them off back up and run
When they see my step far I have come
