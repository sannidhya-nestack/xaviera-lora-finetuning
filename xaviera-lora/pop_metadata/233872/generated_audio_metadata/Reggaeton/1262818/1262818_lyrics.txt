Barefoot on the moonlit beach
Dancing where the waves can't reach
In your eyes I see a language that no words can teach
Drop the beat, feel the vibe
In our island paradise we come alive
With the rhythm of our heart we travel
Under a canopy of stars our love will thrive
Underneath the shimmering skies
Where shadows mix with whispering sights
Tropically, romantically, the time flies
Feel the sand, touch the sea
Underneath the palm trees, wild and free
In the rhythm, in the love and ugly
Dancing to the melody, just you and me
Move your waist, watch the tide
In this dance there's nowhere to hide
Tonight we let all worries slide
In the moonlight glow our love is tied
Our love is tied
As the reggae whispers in our ear
Knocked infused blood is all that we hear
Under this cosmic chandelier
With every beat our hearts draw near
Raise your hands, close your eyes
To the rhythm of the night our spirit flies
In this dance I'll multiply
So the break of day our passion never dies
Never dies
As the dawn paints a new day with sandy feet we sway and sway
In our dance we found a way to etch this lover's memory in the pop reggae ballet
