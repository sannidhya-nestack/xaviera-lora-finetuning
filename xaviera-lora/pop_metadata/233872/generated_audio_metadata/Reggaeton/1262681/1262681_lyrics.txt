Underneath neon skies
We are dancing tonight
Your hand which is mine
Our fingers intertwine
Our bodies sway with emotion
Alive within the ocean
Your eyes locked with mine
I am lost in the passage of time
We're dancing in the moonlight
Under stars shine so bright
Uplifting vibes fill the air
Tonight let's have no care
We're dancing in the moonlight
Under stars shining so bright
Uplifting vibes fill the air
Tonight let's have no cares
We're big waves against our feet
The night has never felt so sweet
Our laughter, it echoes in the wind
This moment in our hearts, engraved and pinned
We're moving to the beat of the night
Underneath the moon so luminous and white
Feel the rhythm like a spirit on wire
