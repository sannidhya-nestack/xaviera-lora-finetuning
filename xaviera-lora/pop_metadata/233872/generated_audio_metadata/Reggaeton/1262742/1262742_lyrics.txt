Feeling the rhythm under the lights
Sweating bodies in the tropical night
Coconut sands fill the air
Bodies moving without a care
In this tempo we find our flow
In our hearts the hot sun goes
No words needed our eyes confess
In this rhythm we find our rest
Dance, dance under the moonlight
Feel the beat holding you tight
It's a fusion of love and sound
In this beat we are abound
The night's alive with the island too, under the stars beneath the moon
Melodies flowing like the sea
In this rhythm we are free
With every beat we're getting closer
In this night there's no closure
One look one touch no regret
In this rhythm we are set
Dance, dance under the spotlight
Feel the beat, take aim, fly
It's a fusion of soul and desire
In this rhythm we fuel the fire
So keep dancing'til the morning light
In this rhythm we ignite
When the sun rises we'll be together
Bound by the rhythm forever and ever
So keep dancing'til the morning light
In this rhythm we ignite
When the sun rises we'll be together
Bound by the rhythm forever and ever
