Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Turn up the volume let the rhythm flow
Lost in the sunset where we wanna go
Eyes full of dreams hearts beating fast
Dancing in a world made to last
Shaking to the beat we own the night
In the starlight everything feels right like
Go turn it back we've crossed the line
Feel the make it tone it's so divine
We're dancing with the rhythm oh
Moving like the ocean eh eh eh
When the moon is kissing the sea
We're caught in our own symphony
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Sparkling like diamonds in the night sky
Hot like the sun, we're gonna fly high
Music blending, body swaying
A love story, we're scripting, no delaying
Tangled in the laughter, lost in the feel
Nothing to capture, everything's real
See us all kissing our lips
Caught in the moment, swaying our hips
We dance to our rhythm, oh-oh
Moving like the ocean, eh-eh-eh
Underneath the starry canopy
We're creating our own symphony
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Into the night, chasing horizons glow
This is us living in a pop reggae show
We're dancing with the rhythm
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Heartbeat matching the tempo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Underneath the moonlit melody
We're lost in a reggaeton fantasy
Oh, oh, oh
Let me out
Into the night, chasing horizons glow
This is us living in a pop reggae show
We're dancing with the rhythm, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Heartbeat matching the tempo, eh-eh-eh
Underneath the moonlit melody
We're lost in a reggaeton fantasy
