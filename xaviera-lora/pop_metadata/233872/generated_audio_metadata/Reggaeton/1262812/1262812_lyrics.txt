Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Waking up feeling the sun on my skin
Salty air as the day begins
Move to the rhythm, move to the beat
Heart is pumping like the summer heat
Yeah, yeah, it's a beautiful day
Just me, my dreams and the clarity
Don't need no worries, cast them away
Love in the city, feeling so pretty
Move your body, let it sway
Feel the rhythm, dance away
Under the sunny golden ray
In the town where the palm trees play
I'd stand under my bare feet
Ocean waves, rhythm so sweet
A fiesta in the streets, bodies collide
Feeling the magic, it's a tropical tide
Oh, it's a new melody
With you, pure serenity
Dancing in the moonlight, feeling so free
The rhythm of my heart, it's my symphony
Move your body, let it sway
Feel the rhythm, dance away
Under the sunny, golden ray
In the town where the palm trees play
Shake your worries, let them fade
Under the moonlight, serenade
Smile at life, don't be afraid
In the town where the memories are made
