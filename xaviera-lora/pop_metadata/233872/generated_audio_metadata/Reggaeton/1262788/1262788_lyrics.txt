In the heart of the city under that golden sun
Got caught in your rhythm, R2 Hawks PS1
Never knew what hit me, those eyes like ocean fun
You dance like the night out, you're my reggae turn run
Let's light up the night just you and me
Swing with the melody, it's true ecstasy
Dance to the rhythm, feel the beat
Life in Technicolor, can't you see?
Look at you sparkle beneath this neon glow
Your moves are like magic, come on let's take it slow
Caught in this chorus where the wild winds blow
Living a dream in this break it don't show
The stars we ignite under this moon so bright
Move with the moment oh it just feels right
Getting lost in the rhythm under the pale moonlight
This is our story our song of the night
In the heat of the dance, under that falling sun
Our souls met in rhythm, August has just begun
Let's keep this moment before the night is done
Dance like the night in our reggaeton run
