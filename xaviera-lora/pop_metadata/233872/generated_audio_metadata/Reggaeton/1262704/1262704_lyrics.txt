Lo besito y tu se come
Pero te pido luz
Can't be no
Feeling the rhythm
In the middle of the night
Under the moonlight
Everything feels right
Dancing close with you beside me
In this moment there's no place I'd rather be
Shake it up let it loose in the heat of the night
Take my hand follow the beat you're my delight
Dance floor's on fire
With our rhythm combining
The magic of the night
Your love I'll find
Skin on skin, body swaying
In your eyes I see what you're saying
Taste your sweet kisses intoxicating
With each touch my heart you claiming
Move with the music feel the tropical vibe
Just us under the stars feeling the jive
This is our dance our love enshrined
Lost in the rhythm two souls entwined
Tonight we're making memories under the stars
With the rhythm of our hearts
Playing like guitars
As the sun comes up in your eyes I dive
This will be a night we will always visualize
We'll our eyes
And the moon
