When I see you dancing I'm like ola ola ola ola
With your move fancy make me wanna holla holla holla holla
I got your attention spending a moola moola moola moola
And my trust popping pockets swolla swolla swolla swolla
I wanna hold my air force ones
I wanna hold my jots and fours
I wanna go on a basket court
I wanna play up and down the floor
Our family sneaker heads with JNZone in the gang
We will go higher everyday we will go to the moon this way
From New York to Spain we take photos of life
On our midday we start more enterprise
From Cali to Bali we got the best art from Mali
Getting down like a dancehall party we're blazing like Bob Marley
When I see you dancing I'm like ola, ola, ola, ola
With your move fancy make me wanna hola, hola, hola, hola
I got your attention spending a mula, mula, mula, mula
And my drugs pop in pockets swola, swola, swola, swola
Step up on the scene all eyes on we
Moving as a unit ain't no YNRT
Crypto in a dream
Cop a pair of kicks cop another NFT
Born in the 80's sneaker heads going crazy
For the retros and the best flows in the top shelf trees
Rolling in the VC
Seven on the beat
Turning up the heat
C-C-Cooking in the kitchen for everyone to see
Crap I'll pick and post it in the channel show your sneaks
If you're a sneaker freaker then I know you rock with me
You know I got a couple daughters and I started from the bottom
Now they got me out here modding and I got a lot of problems
But my kicks ain't one and if they flip they done
I'd flip every kick I ever picked if I could get just one
Way too hot for the moon hollering to the sun
When I see you dancing I'm like ola, ola, ola, ola
With your move fancy make me wanna holla, holla, holla, holla
I got your attention spending a moola, moola, moola, moola
And my drugs pop in pockets swolla, swolla, swolla, swolla
Pockets on swole
There's no other place like home
My sneaker heads off
But my new shoes be on
I like my cement poles
Let me ask you what's yours
Fresh kicks fresh poles
We gone take it around the globe
You ain't sneak ahead family go home
We gone make it well known
In the VC we talk about life
Like what's wrong and right
Entities and utilities
Started with a white list now OG
Not a thing for free it ain't one of these
We gone make it to the moon you'll see
When I see you dancing I'm like ola, ola, ola, ola
With your move fancy make me wanna hola, hola, hola, hola
I got your attention spending a mula, mula, mula, mula
And my trash pop in pockets swola, swola, swola, swola
