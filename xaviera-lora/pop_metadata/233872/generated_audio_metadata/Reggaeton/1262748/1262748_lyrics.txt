I wake up in the morning with the sun on my skin
Got that ocean breeze blowing, the day is about to begin
Take a step on the sand, let the rhythm take hold
Get the beat of the island flowing deep in my soul
We're dancing in moonlight, under the palm trees
Living our lives like a tropical dream
Yeah, we're swaying to the rhythm, just you and me
This is our song, our sweet melody
Sipping coconut water as the sunset dips low
Though our eyes shine brighter in the evening glow
No worries, no hassle, just a vibe so right
Let the music take us to the Caribbean night
We're dancing in moonlight under the palm trees
Living our lives like a tropical dream
Yeah, we're swaying to the rhythm
Just you and me
This is our song, our sweet melody
Let the rhythm of the waves match the beat of our hearts
