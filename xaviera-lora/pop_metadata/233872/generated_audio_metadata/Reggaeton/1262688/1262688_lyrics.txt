Ain't no vibrant city likes
No room for the nighttime blues
Got my heart skipping beats
From Miami to Malibu
She dances like a fire
Burning through the city streets
When she moves
The rhythm follows
It's a sight that never repeats
From the sunrise to the moonlight
We're dancing nonstop
Moving with the rhythm
From the bottom to the top
She got the sun kissing
In that tropical flow
We're lost in her rhythm
Where the summer winds blow
Sunsets and silhouettes in the island groove
Passionate bodies intertwining to that wrecking modern move
Softly airing her curls
Ocean echoes in her eyes
Every beat's surreal
Like the stars in paradise skies
Palm trees sway
As our bodies collide
Ocean waves imitate
Our hearts in rhythmic time
From sunrise to the moonlight
We're wrapping up tight
In sync with the rhythm
Dancing through the night
She's melody in the chaos under the club glow
We're caught in the rhythm mode
Where the wild winds blow (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh ,oh)
Star kissin' (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (star kissin'cause I'm lookin' for you)
Under the moonlight (uh-uh), where the wild winds blow (uh-uh), where the wild winds blow
From the sunrise to the moonlight we're dancing non-stop
Moving with the rhythm from the bottom to the top
