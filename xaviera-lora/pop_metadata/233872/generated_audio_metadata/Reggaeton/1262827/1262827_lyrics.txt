Yeah, she's dancing under the moonlight like a wild wave
Eyes so bright, she's got the rhythm that I crave
With each step she takes, she lights up the floor
Leaves me wanting, dreaming
Craving for more
Let's get lost in the rhythm under the nightscape
Dance till we et there's no room for escape
Turn up the heat let the rhythm be your guide
In this dance of desire there's no way to hide
With a salty breeze and a head flowing free
She's a tropical dream, a sight for all to see
Her laughter rings over the strum of the strings
Her movement a melody that makes my heart sing
Let the rhythm envelop you, stomp your feet to the beat
Catch the fiery spark, feel the tropical heat
With the moon as our starlight, love as our stage
Let's dance like the tide, uncaged
As dawn breaks, we're spent and out of breath
In the wake of passion, that dance with no death
She's my tropical rhythm, my sweet serenade
In her arms I found the rhythm, in her heart I lay
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh
More than words
