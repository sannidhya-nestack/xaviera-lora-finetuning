And in the city lights, were the nights alive
My heart's on fire, feeling so high
Walking down the streets with your hand in mine
Let the rhythm lead, lose track of time
Dance through the night under the neon sky
Move to the rhythm, let your soul ignite
Baby it's just you and me in a melody
In this symphony of love so right
In those hazel eyes I see paradise
It's miles, miles sunrise beyond any price
Best when on the sand, as the waves collide
With the tropical breeze on this magical ride, ah-ah
A sway to the beat under the stars so bright
Two hearts in rhythm in the moon's soft light
Baby it's just you and me in a dance so free
In this symphony of love tonight
This rhythm's calling, deeper we're falling
Into the music where dreams reside
No space or time, lost in prime
In this unending, passionate tide
Sway with me under the moonlit night
To the sultry rhythm that feels so right
Baby it's just you and me feeling carefree
In this symphony of love hold tight
As the sun arises the music comprises
Memories remain under the skies
Together we beat with a rhythm so neat
In this symphony of love our beautiful prize
