Girl, I'm gonna drop it for the sun, girl
I see you slipping, that's me wrong
Your eyes dancing, can't overcome
This groove won't stop until the night is done
Shake it up, let the rhythm move
The speed got us in the groove
Then we moved close with nothing to prove
Lost in the rhythm
The nights are blue
The golden glow in the moonlight
Feeling your body close so right
Come love let's dance until daylight
Cruising with waves on this endless night
Shake it up, turn the rhythm'round
In the heat of the night, love is found
Through the beat, through the sound
In this paradise, our hearts are bound
Curl your hips sway and say breathe
Underneath the waving palm trees
The rhythm of love, the key
In this tropical paradise
