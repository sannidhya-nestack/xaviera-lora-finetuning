I got a beard that I rescued
I got a love that I lost
I got a kiss since I met you
I got your name on my notes
I've got everything but I don't have you
I've got everything but I don't have you
I got everything but I don't have you
I got everything but I don't have you
Got a bear that I rescued
I got a love that I lost
I got a kiss since I met you
I got your name on my nose
I've got everything but I don't have you
I've got everything but I don't have you
I've got everything but I don't have you
I've got everything but I don't have you
I've got everything but I don't have you
I've got everything but I don't have you
I've got everything but I don't have you
I've got everything but I don't have you
