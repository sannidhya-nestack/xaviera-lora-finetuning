Baby, under the palm trees we sway
Electric connection lighting our way
Your eyes glistening brighter than a vat of night
Our bodies moving rhythmically, it just feels right
Your touch on my skin, hot like the sun
This rhythm we're feeling, we're the only ones
Our heartbeats in sync like a perfect rhyme
Dancing under the stars, this is track of time
We are dancing, we are shining
Under the veil of the night
Our bodies moving closer in the moon's soft light
Can you feel the rhythm?
Baby, can you feel the love?
We're dancing our dreams under the stars above
Your laughter's the sweetest melody in my ear
In this dance of love, all I want is to have you near
Would you see as our soundtrack, listen beneath our feet
This un ettable moment with you, so sweet
Your laughter's the sweetest melody in my ear
In this dance of love, all I want is have you near
With the sea as our soundtrack
That stand beneath our feet
This un ettable moment
With you is so sweet
We're dancing, we're dreaming
In this tropical embrace
Every beat of the music
Every move engraves
Can you feel the rhythm baby?
Can you feel the heat?
We're creating memories with each heartbeat
As the dawn breaks, the music fades but our dance continues
Underneath the morning sun there's no more venues
Just you and me and our hearts discreet
In this rhythm of love, our song's complete
Your laughter's the sweetest melody in my ear
In this dance of love all I want is to have you near
We can see as our soundtrack, the sand beneath our feet
It's un ettable
