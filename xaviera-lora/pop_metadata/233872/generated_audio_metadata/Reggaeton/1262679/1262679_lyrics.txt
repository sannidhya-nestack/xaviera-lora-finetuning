Ah, waking up to the Miami sun, look down, wash your hands on
Walking on the sandy beach, feeling so strong
Got my drink in hand, oh yeah, feeling fine
The palm trees and the blue sea are my mind
Had no worries, now we're dancing cheek to cheek
Just the rhythm and the heartbeat, no words to speak
From sunset to sunrise, we're lost in time
Beneath the bright moonlight, your heart is next to mine
Buzzing in the air, can't you feel the heat?
Moving our bodies to the rhythm
From our heads to our feet
Just let the music play, let it serenade
Underneath the starry night
We begin to sway
Turnin' up the heat in this tropical night
In this sweep it up, we'll dance until daylight
No matter where we are, we'll just keep on swayin'
In this rhythm of life, our hearts keep playin'
But there's that look in your eyes, oh yeah, it's quite a sight
In your arms I lose myself in the soft moonlight
With the waves crashing in and your gentle whisper
In this fiery dance everything's a bliss, a blistery blur
It's buzzing in the air, can't you feel the heat?
Just the rhythm and the heartbeat, the words speak
From sunset to sunrise, we're lost in time
Beneath the black moonlight, beneath the black moonlight
It's buzzing in the air, can't you feel the heat?
Moving our bodies to the rhythm
From our heads to our feet, oh yeah, ah
Just let the music play, let it serenade
Underneath the starry night, we begin to sway
It's buzzing in the air, can't you feel the heat?
Moving our bodies to the rhythm
From our heads to our feet, just let the music play
Let it serenade underneath the starry night
We begin to sway
Sway, swaying, sway, turning up the heat in this tropical night
In this sweet rhythm, we'll dance until daylight
No matter where we are, we'll just keep on swaying
In this rhythm of love, our hearts keep playing
In this rhythm of love, our hearts keep playing
Sway, swaying, sway, turning up the heat in this tropical night
In this sweet rhythm, we'll dance until daylight
No matter where we are, we'll just keep on swaying
