Gazing at the moonlight
Sipping tequila on the beach
Your hazel eyes look like
Barely just within reach
A Latin vibe running through my veins
In this paradise there ain't no chains
We're dancing close, your body hits the beat
Underneath the palm trees
Feeling that tropical heat, it's galleon day
Like fire and the sun
Baby, this rhythm has only just begun
Your whispers soft like the ocean breeze
Got my heart running wild just like the seven seas
Crashing like waves your laughter in the night
Baby to hold you close feels so right
We move to the rhythm under the neon glow
Our bodies entwined in a dance flow
Under the stars, the night is young
This feeling baby can't be undone
As the steel drums play, you're pulling me near
Every beat of my heart, only you can hear
With sandy toes and salty skin
Tonight baby it's a win win
Lost in this moment, entranced by the beat
In tune with the rhythm, ain't this sweet
It's a night to remember, a night of fun
Underneath the Caribbean, shades of the setting sun
