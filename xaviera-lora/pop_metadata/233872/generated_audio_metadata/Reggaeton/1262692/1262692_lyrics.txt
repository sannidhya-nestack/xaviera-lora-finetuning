Girl, you shine brighter than the morning sun
Our rhythm is fun, no candle, no smoking gun
Come closer, let us sway under the moon
I like this moment, it's magic, baby, hold me tight
We'll stay with the love steady in my ear
Hold me closer, let the world disappear
We're in the stance of hearts, don't be afraid
We are infinite, our memories will fade
Oh, we're dancing, moving to the beat
In this world of ours there's no retreat
Under the moon and sun our dance has just begun
In the rhythm of love we are becoming one
Sparks fly with every beat of the drum
This dance for our empire that we've won
Your hips sway to the rhythm so divine
Lost in the music your heart close to mine
Through the rhythm of the night we will glide
In the sea of love baby just enjoy the ride
Don't worry'bout tomorrow live for tonight
In the beat of love everything is so right
Only dancing moving to the beat
In this world of ours there's no retreat
Under the moon and sun our dance has just begun
In the rhythm of love we are becoming one
Oh we're dancing on this moving crazy night
Paradise found in your arms so tight
This feeling this sound it's a sweet delight
In your eyes I see my world so bright
Oh we dance and move into the beat
In this world of ours there's no retreat
On this rhythm our love will ever end
Together we dance my love oh my friend
Oh we're dancing moving to the beat
In this world of ours there's no retreat
Under the moon and sun our dance has just begun
In the rhythm of love we are becoming one
Sparks fly with every beat of the drum
This dance for our empire that we've won
Your hips sway to the real rhythm so divine
Lost in the music your heart close to mine
Sparks fly with every beat of the drum
In this world of ours there's no retreat
Under the moon and sun our dance has just begun
In the rhythm of love we are becoming one
Sparks fly with every beat of the drum
In this world of ours there's no retreat
Under the moon and sun our dance has just begun
In the rhythm of love joining our heart goes to mine
Oh, oh, oh, we're shooting like stars
As the music fades as night turns to day
In my arms girl, I want you to stay
This rhythm all your love won't end
Together we dance my love, my friend
