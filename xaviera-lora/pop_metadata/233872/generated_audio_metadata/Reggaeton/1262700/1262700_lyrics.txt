Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, come on, we're flowing with the breeze
We'll pass away, get me weak in the knees
In the city streets, under the neon lights
Calling the rhythm, we dance through the nights
Turn it up, let the beat drop
In the rhythm, we never stop
Just you and I in the pulsing heat
With the rhythm underneath our feet
Your eyes tell a story, always burn my ear
In this dance, there's nothing to fear
Under the stars, we claim the night
With every beat, we take our flight
Turn it up, let the beat drop
And remember that we never stop
Just you and I in the pulsing heat
With the rhythm marching the Aussie
Your eyes tell a story, whisper in my ear
In this dance there's nothing to fear
Under the stars we claim the night
With every beat we take our fight
Turn it up, let the beat drop
In the rhythm we never stop
Just you and I in the pulse and heat
With the rhythm underneath our feet
Turn it up, let the beat drop
In the rhythm we never stop
Just you and I in the pulse and heat
With the rhythm underneath our feet
The melody intertwined
In this dance you are my mind
With the rhythm taking the lead
One way or night we are free
In the rhythm we never stop
Just you and I in the fall city
We're the rhythm underneath
As the sun begins to roam
In the rhythm we find our home
In this dance we let it show
With the rhythm we let it flow
Turn it up, let the beat drop
In the rhythm we never stop
Just you and I in the pulsing heat
With the rhythm underneath our feet
Let the melody intertwine
In this dance you are my mind
Let the rhythm take you in the lead
One with the night we are free
Let the melody intertwine
In this dance you are my mind
Let the rhythm take you in the lead
One with the night we are free
The melody intertwine
In this dance you are my mind
With the rhythm taking the lead
One with the night we are free
