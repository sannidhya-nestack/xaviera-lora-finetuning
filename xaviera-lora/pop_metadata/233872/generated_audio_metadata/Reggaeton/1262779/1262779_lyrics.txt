Let the moonlight deny my fear
Whispered promises only we hear
Your touch makes the night come alive
In your arms I feel the rhythm, I dive
Move your body to the tropical vibe
Our hearts are dancing, they jive
Oh, in this rhythm of the night
With you everything feels so right
Lost in the rhythm of your hazel eyes
In this moment love is our only guise
The night whispers a lovely sonnet
With melodies that make us et or regret
Feel the beat taking over the night
Everything about you feels so right
Oh, dance with me until the morning light
With every movement our souls unite
We've got the rhythm we've got control
Every beat pulsating taking its toll
In this sweet intoxication of delight
We dance under the glimmering twilight
Our bodies swaying in the midnight tide
In this dance we have nothing to hide
Oh your touch ignites the magic within
Every beat is a symphony on our skin
Dancing with you under the stars so bright
Immersed in the rhythm of the night
When the morning sun begins to rise
We'll still be dancing in each other's eyes
Oh, in this rhythm of the night
With you everything feels so right
Dancing with you under the stars so bright
Immersed in the rhythm of the night
