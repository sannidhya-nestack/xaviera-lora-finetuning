Yeah, that house in the, the valley, yeah
Naked girls in the little leather man, yeah
He cracks the whip, she does the flip
Like a nut, it gets down in strips
Can you handle this? (Can you handle this?)
Can you handle this? (Can you handle this? Can you handle this?)
Can you handle this? (Can you handle this)
Can you handle this? (Can you handle this?)
Yeah, that house in the, the, the land, yeah
Naked girls in a little leather man, yeah
He cracks the whip, she does the flip
Sliding down in strips
Can you handle this?
Can you handle this?
Can you handle this?
Can you handle this? Can you handle this? Can you handle this?
Breaks the whip, she burns the flip
Just like her mother's cast iron strips
Can you handle this?
There's a house in the Netherlands
Whatever you can handle
Can you handle this?
Can you handle this?
Yeah, that's the way I live
