Tonight, land under the laundry sky
Love in the way your eyes define mine
Sun's sweeping, the stars start to play
Bodies swaying in that tropical way
Our hearts are speaking rhythm
Languages that need no word
Our dances whisper secrets
Only the moon is heard
This is the rhythm of our souls on fire
Beats pounding like a wild decider
In this moonlight magic feeling so right
Dancing with you in a tropical night
Latino whispers on a gentle breeze
The sea's beating hard puts my soul at ease
Your hands, oh, they move like a song
With you is where our truth belong
Feel the rhythm of the passion unite
Under the enchanting moonlight
Through the dance our spirits ignite
Forever entwined in a tropical night
Feel the rhythm of the passion unite
Under the enchanting moonlight
Through the dance our spirits ignite
Forever entwined in a tropical night
Hold me closer as the night turns to day
As the rhythm of our hearts gently sway
Deep may fade but the melody's bright
Forever dancing in this tropical night
