Tonight we're a dance among the neon lights
Your eyes reflect in the city vibrant nights
Bodies moving insane feeling so right
Rhythms flowing like the oceans tide
No language barrier love knows no define
In this dance our hearts intertwine
Just me and you leaving the world behind
In this rhythm the sanctuary we find
Under the moon bodies in motion
Effortless unfolding with pure devotion
Creating a melody stirring the potion
Tonight we're causing a commotion
Tropical heat and the rhythm's pulsing
Your whisper sweet sets my heart racing
Underneath the stars there's no disguising
And the rhythm of the night loves ascending
Your touch electric sends me reeling
With each beat I can't describe this feeling
In the night's rhythm finds a heart healing
Tonight we arrive, a story's beginning
Under the moon, body's in motion
Effortlessly floating with pure devotion
Creating a melody, stirring the potion
Tonight we're causing a commotion
In the rhythm of the night, freedom circles high
Underneath the starlit sky, let our spirits fly
Tonight the music rides our story
In this dance we find our glory
