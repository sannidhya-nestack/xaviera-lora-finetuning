In this city of lights, our hearts beat tonight
Underneath the neon signs, the shadows dancing fine
Feel the rhythm, feel the bass, I see the joy in your face
Let your hips sway, no restraint to our love's melody and tense
Play with me in this crazy beat
Flow like the ocean so deep so sweet
Turn up the heat under the moon so bright
In our rhythm of two hearts let's ignite
The night is our canvas paint stories untold
Under the stardust feel your hand out whole
With every whisper in the wind
As the music spins
Let's dance away to the pulse of the night where our love begins
Sway with me in this crazy beat
Flow like the ocean so deep so sweet
Turn up the heat under the moon so upright
In a rhythm of two hearts let's ignite
The night is our canvas painting stories untold
Under the stardust feel your hand I hold
With every whisper in the wind as we leave the moon
A barefoot dance on the golden sand
A love story written by our own hand
Under the veil of shimmering moonlight
Basking in your love oh what a sight
Sway with me in this crazy beat
Flow like the ocean so deep so sweet
Turn up the heat under the moon so bright
In our rhythm of two hearts let's ignite
The night is our canvas painting stories untold
Under the stars is the hand I hold
With every whisper in the wind our arc begins
Sway with me, let the night repeat
In the rhythm of our hearts that meet
With every sunrise and each star's twilight
Our love, like the rhythm, stays alive
We dance until sunrise, a dream so divine
In the rhythm of love where your heart beats with mine
As the music fades under the morning light
Our rhythm, our dance, our love stays bright
Under neon lights, we're dancing, we're alive
Feeling the rhythm, feeling the vibe
With your hand in mine, let our bodies intertwine
In the heart of the city, we sparkle and shine
Move to the rhythm, let's heat up the night
Under the moonlight, our love takes flight
Let's dance'til dawn, just you and I
With this beat, we're soaring high
In the vibrant night, our love is loud
Dancing in the rhythm, lost in the crowd
Your smile is the melody that lights my way
With every beat, we sway and sway
Dance with me under the stars so bright
Our hearts are pounding, feeling light
In the rhythm of love, we're unstoppable
Dance with me
