On the lip and on the tongue team dance is free
Eyes like honey and moves like the sea
The rhythm we're dressed in the heat of the night
The laughter rings pleasure pure and bright
Listen to the beat feel this tropical call
In the sway of our bodies bury us full
We're not just dancing we're setting sparks
Two silhouettes dancing in the dark
Swaying in the spotlight, feeling the groove
In the rhythm of the night, we move
A whisper sweet like a summer breeze
We're dancing clues, lost in the tropical tease
Caught in a rhythm, my body's entwined
With every beat, the souls align
Without a word, they're speaking loud
Above the rhythm and underneath the cloud
The beats get slow, then they push and pull
The tension, the silence, it's all so full
Not just a dance, it's a passion unleashed
And the rhythm of the night, be released
Dancing in the moonlight under the stars, to the rhythm they erase their scars
Her touch soothing his whispers loud, in the rhythm of the night they're unfound
As dawn breaks, the beats fade out with the rising sun
And they're out in the rhythm of the night
They've danced, they've soared, a dance to remember and I adored
