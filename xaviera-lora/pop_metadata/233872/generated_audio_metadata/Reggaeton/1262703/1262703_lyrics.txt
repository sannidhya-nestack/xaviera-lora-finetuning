Don't know if you're good or bad
Don't know nothing, say no lie
Dancing bodies in the sunset vibe
Lost in time
Heartbeats are coming alive
Dancing bodies in the sunset vibe
She moves like a summer stream
Underneath the moonlight's gleam
She's got a taste of the ocean floor
Got me dancing, can't let go
We're sipping on the sunlight
Dipping in the midnight
Feeling the warmth, feeling the sunlight
Her body sways with that tropical rhythm
Our hearts play songs heaven untold hymn
Underneath the palm trees swaying in her breeze
Caught in a trance got me falling on my knees
She's got me lost in this new maze
Her eyes hold the sun sets blaze
Moving to the rhythm under the moonlit prism
Dancing with the waves in synchronized rhythm
In the music of the night, when the stars align
Together we dance lost in time
She's the rhythm and the chaos, the melody and the wind
It touches the symphony where my dreams begin
On the rhythm we ride, on the beat we glide
In the end of dreams where love collides
Don't look at the mirror, don't look back, it's been a lie
Dead in the cities and missing sunset by the last in time
Her body sways with that tropical rhythm
Our hearts play songs of an untold hymn
Underneath the palm trees, swaying in the breeze
Caught in a trance, caught me falling on my knees
She's got me lost in the city maze
Her eyes hold the sunset's place
Moving to the rhythm
Under the moonlight prism
Dancing with the waves, it seems we're passing through
On the stars and lines, together we dance lost in time (lost in time)
She's the moon in a chaos of night
And the wind that touches the symphony where our dreams begin
On the rhythm we ride, on the beat we glide (beat we glide)
In the land of dreams where love collides
I wanna live the way that I like
On the beat we glide
In the land of dreams where love collides
Love collides
I wanna shake up and be alive
Don't realize that I'm alive
Dead in the cities and nothing's on set by
The last in time
Okay, wonky
Okay
On the music of the night
When the stars align
Together we dance lost in time
Under the moonlit prison
Dancing with the waves
In synchronized schism
On the rhythm we ride
On the beat we climb (on the beat we climb)
The night and the dreams where love collides
