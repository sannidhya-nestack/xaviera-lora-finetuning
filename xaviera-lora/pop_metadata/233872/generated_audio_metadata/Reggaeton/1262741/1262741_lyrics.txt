With me, in the tropical heat
Underneath the stars, feel the beat
Your eyes, they shine, so sweet and so fine

With the night's rhythm, our bodies flow
Tonight, darling, we'll let our love show

Our hearts hit with desire
Your whispers, your touch, take me higher in this dance
We dance on a -<|8.28|>
