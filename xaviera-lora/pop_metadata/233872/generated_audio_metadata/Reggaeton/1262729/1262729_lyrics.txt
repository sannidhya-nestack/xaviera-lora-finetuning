No more scars, got over on your skin, it's flawless
In your eyes, I dive in, it's endless
Salty breeze, your sweet kiss has me breathless
Summer love at night, it feels like we're weightless
We sway to the rhythm under a solid sky
In the heat of the night, emotions running high
Dancing to the beat, hands up in the air
This moment feels so sweet beyond compare
Your whisper in my ear sends chills down my spine
Your touch so sincere, I'm glad you're mine
Tropical vibes captivate, our bodies entwined
In this rhythm of the night our souls aligned
We're lost in translation, in the rhythm, in the groove
In this dance of affection, we suddenly move
Lost in your eyes, in the music we're free
In this dance of love it's just you and me
Feel the rhythm in the night, the beat of our hearts
In your arms everything feels right
The masterpiece of life
Underneath the starry sky
We dance away our fears
In this melody of the night
Everything appears
As the night fades away
With the rhythm with the sound
In the heat of the night
Emotions running high
Dancing to the beat, hands up in the air
This moment feels so sweet, beyond compare
You whisper in my ear, in my ear so sweet
Beyond compare, beyond compare
You whisper in my ear, send chills down my spine
Your touch so sincere, I'm glad you're mine
Tropical vibes captivate our bodies in 2020
