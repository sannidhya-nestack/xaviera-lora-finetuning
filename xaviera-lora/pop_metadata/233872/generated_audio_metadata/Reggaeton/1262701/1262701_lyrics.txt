But underneath the moon so don't hide
In the city filled with lights
I wanna dance for you and I
Where the stars meet the night
Let the rhythm take you high
In this moment we let time fly by
Swirling under the neon lights
In a dance we own the night
Let the rhythm take you high
In this moment we let time fly by
Swirling under the neon lights
In a dance we own the night
Sweet whistles in the Latin heat
Your touch so soft so sweet
Your laughter is my melody
And with each beat we meet
Dancing closely heart to heart
In this rhythm we are never apart
But soon it feels so right
With you it's a starry night
The night is young, the music's loud
In the city we're lost in the crowd
Feel the passion, feel the heat
With this beat, it's a tropical treat
In this dance we own the night
On the starry, a wireless sign
With our rhythm we are one
Under the silver moon and a golden sun
Sweet whispers in the Latin heat
Your touch so soft, so sweet
Your laughter is my melody
And with each beat we meet
Sweet whispers in the Latin heat
Your touch so soft, so sweet
Your laughter is my melody
And with each beat we meet
Sweet whispers in the Latin heat
Your touch, your touch, so soft, so sweet
Your laughter is my melody
And with each beat only me, with me
Then it's dance moves in the Latin heat
Your touch, your touch, so soft, so sweet
Your laughter is my melody
And with each beat only me
Dancing closely heart to heart
In this rhythm we're never apart
A tune that feels so right
With you it's a starry night
The night is young, the music's loud
In this rhythm, we're lost in the crowd
Feel the passion, feel the heat
The few, it's a speed, it's a tropical treat
In this dance, we own the night
In this dance, we own the night
