Poetry on a Tuesday night
Dancing under the city lights
Body swaying to the rhythm
Feeling so right
Let the beat drop, let your heart stop
When we hit the street, let's ride non-stop
Catch the flavor of the night at this raw spot
With reggae vibes and a pop art
Seeing you on the dance floor, queen
Moving hips like I've never seen
In your eyes I find a shimmer, a tropical dream
Move your body, lose control
This beat's all about letting music our soul
In this dance of ours, we're on a roll with our groove
And that's the reggaeton, our goal
In every step, in every beat
Our hearts align pulsating heat
Reggae sunsets, pop sweet treats
Tonight we're making history on the street
So take my hand, don't shy away
Join this rhythm and colors of grey
The night is young and we're here to play
Catch the rhythm, catch the wave
In this lavish night we misbehave
With the pop assistants and reggaeton raid
the break of day, it's our private rave
As the sun rises painted in the sky
Our bodies are tired but spirits still high
Together we dance under the moon's eye
In the blend of the pop and the reggae sky
Move your body and lose control
This beats all love like I've never seen
In your eyes I find a shimmer, a tropical dream
Move your body, lose control
This beats our love, let it music our soul
In this dance of ours, we're on a roll
Without moving, listen, reggaeton, our goal
Move your body, lose control
This beats our love, let it music our soul
In this dance of ours, we're on a roll
Without moving, listen, reggaeton, our goal
In every step and in every beat
Our hearts and mind pulsate in heat
Reggae sunsets pop sweet treats
