The air and the rhythm under the moon's light
Walking down the beach, lost in a tropical night
Hear sun kissing, reflecting a flashing neon
People around us, moving to the lights with a new song
Suddenly the world's up, scissors sway
Lost in the moment, letting the beats play
Cotton tied, dance born from the sea
In this paradise where we are free
It's fiesta under the starry sky
In this rhythm we live, dance and fly
Feeling the heartbeat, the drum, the sweet guitar
This is the rhythm of love, no matter where we are
It's a fiesta under starry skies
In this rhythm we live, dance and fly
Feeling the heartbeat, the drum, the sweet guitar
This is the rhythm of love, no matter where we are
Caught in the rhythm of a powerful night
Mixing the melody, feeling it's alright
Moonlight is our spotlight, this beach our stage
We save up every moment like a handwritten page
It's a fiesta under a starry sky
In this rhythm we live, dance and fly
Feeling the heartbeat, the drum, the sweet guitar
This is the rhythm of love, no matter where we are
Ooh, this musical wave takes us high
Underneath the radiant tropical sky
Just let the rhythm play, let the music say
Come dance with me in this magical bay
It's a fiesta under a starry sky
In this rhythm we live, dance and fly
Feeling the heartbeat, the drum, the sweet guitar
This is the rhythm of love, no matter where we are
As the night fades, giving way to the day
The music still plays as we sway
In this symphony of mist under the morning sky
This rhythm of love will never say goodbye
