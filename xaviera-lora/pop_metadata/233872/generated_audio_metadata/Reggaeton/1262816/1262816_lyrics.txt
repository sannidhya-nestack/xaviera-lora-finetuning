Underneath the night sky, I thought I loved you, yeah
Underneath the heat of the tropical sun
Rhythm and love, our hearts beating like a drum
Bronze skin glowing as we move to the run
Just you and me, baby, we're having so much fun
In our world, the music never stops
Turn the beat up, let our bodies drop
We're dancing wild in the summer rain
Our hearts aflame with the sweet refrain
Feel the rhythm, feel the beat, dance with me
Feel the heat, just you and me together we'll remain
Lost in the music, so pure and unrestrained
Footprints in the sand, hands in the blind
With your sweet sweet kisses, oh baby you blow my mind
Shadows grow all under the silver moonshine
With the rhythm in our hearts we lost all track of time
In our world the music never ends
To the rhythm of love our hearts steadily ascend
Words sway and flow all under a sky so clear
With your whispers mean nothing's in my ear
Feel the melody, feel the beat
Move with me, feeling so sweet
Just you and me, in this passionate frontier
Lost in the rhythm, we hold each other near
Hold tight with you, everything's right
With you around, every star shines so bright
In this melody, in this beat
Feel the love, feel the heat
Just you and me, dancing into the night
Lost in each other, feeling so right
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
