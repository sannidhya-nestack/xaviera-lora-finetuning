And they only have eyes
And I keep a good look out for the skies
Walking down the street got me hypnotized
Your silhouette dances with the setting sun
Got this feeling inside maybe you're the one
We swipe to the rhythm in this endless night
In the pulsing crowd under the neon light
Our bodies move together like the ocean's tune
Underneath the stars, underneath the silver moon
Your eyes are Mr. Journey, I'm falling deep
Into the rhythm of the night, secrets we'll keep
Underneath the palm trees we let it go
Caught up in the melody, in the afterglow
We move to the beat in this tropical heat
In the midst of passion where two hearts beat
Joined in the dance under the evening haze
Everlasting moment in this endless play
Turning the page to a different story
Living in the rhythm of love and glory
Through the eyes of the city
Feeling the heat on the dance floor
Where two worlds meet
Through the rhythm of the city
The curvy skies
In the depth of the night where the love lies
Swaying to the music, a dance so wild
Lost in the moment like a fearless child
In this tropical sunset as the night unfolds
Dancing to the rhythm as the stories toll
Underneath the starlight feeling so free
In the heart of the city it's just you and me
In this tropical sunset as the night unfolds
Into the rhythm as the story's told
Underneath the starlight feeling so free
In the heart of the city it's just you and me
