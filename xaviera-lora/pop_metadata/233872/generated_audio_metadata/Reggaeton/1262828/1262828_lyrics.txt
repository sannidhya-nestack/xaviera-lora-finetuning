Summer days, lights in motion
Young days, deeper than the ocean
Dancing shadows, whispered life
Lost in you, a starry night
Dance, dance, let the world disappear
Just you and me, nothing to fear
In the glow of the moon so bright
Hold me close, feel the tropical night
Salty breeze, waves crashing in
Your touch on my sun-kissed skin
Under the palm trees we sway and grin
This beating rhythm where love begins
Move move with the rhythm divine
Underneath the starry skyline
Close your eyes hold me tight
This is our song under the moonlight
Whispered secrets in the soft night air
In this rhythm we share
Barefoot in the sand with not a care
Your heart beats melody beyond compare
Dance dance under the neon sky
Just you and me our spirits fly
Caught in the rhythm we reach new heights
In this dance, we own the night
As the sun begins to rise, we sway and twirl
In this dance, you're my world
With the rhythm in our hearts and the sandy swirl
This is our story, my love, our tropical world
