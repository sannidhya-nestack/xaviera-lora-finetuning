Girl, I'm feeling all in the middle (you're feeling it)
Swaying to the beat on the tropical street (yeah, yeah)
My eyes are starting to see my heart go
Oh yeah, let me just pick a tone
Dancing through the symphony on glow
Body's moving, going with the flow
Oh baby, you got that summer allure
In this city night nothing feels so pure
Dancing through the symphony on glow
Body's moving, going with the flow
Oh baby, you got that summer allure
In this city night nothing feels so pure
The moon is shining
Casting a silver light
Kindling the passion
Igniting the night
With every beat you got me feeling so right
In your arms
Everything's out of sight
Burning desire like the break of dawn
We're light at night until the night is gone
Oh baby in this radiant night
You're the queen in this gooey rhythm
Now make it a scene
Pressing closer missing beyond
Your body's moving your way
With the flow, oh baby, you got that summer allure
In this city night, nothing feels so pure
The toast, the mist, the neon glow
Bodies moving, going with the flow
Oh baby, you got that summer allure
In this city night, nothing feels so pure
The moon is shining, you're casting a silver light
In this city night, nothing feels so pure (feels so pure)
You're, you're
Burning desire like a break of dawn
We're light in the night until the night is gone
Oh baby, in this radiant night
You're the queen in this groovy rhythm
You're making the scene
