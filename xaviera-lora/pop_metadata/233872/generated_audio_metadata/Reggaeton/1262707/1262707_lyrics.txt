Feeling the midnight heat under this island in the skies
Caught in your rhythm as the city passes by
Shadows are dancing in the playful moonlight
Got the feeling we could dance baby all through the night
Tonight
Feel the rhythm ignite
The city is ours in the soft moonlight
In this moment there's no retreat
Just you and me and the pulsating beat
Through the city streets following the neon glow
Caught in the magic of this rhythm don't let it go
You whisper in my ear like a sultry tropical breeze
In the rhythm of the music we move with such ease
Tonight feel the rhythm ignite
The city is ours in the soft moonlight
In this moment there's no retreat
Just you and me and the pulsing beat
Through the city streets following the neon glow
Caught in the neon glow
Caught in the moment there's no retreat
Just you and me and the pulsing beat
This rhythm of the night it's a beautiful sight
You and I baby feeling just right
Caught in this moment under the palm tree
We're dancing just dancing so wild and free
Feel the rhythm ignite
The city is ours under the moonlight
In this moment there's no retreat
Just you and me and the pulsing beat
As the sun starts to break the rhythm never ends
Caught in the magic as a new day begins
In the rhythm of the music
We find our sweet defeat
In the heat of the night
In this pulsing beat
