Bright lights, city nights
Feeling ever so right
Your hand in mine, not looking back
Disco ball, starlit track
We're dancing on the edge of time
In a rhythm solely yours and mine
Turn the music up, let it shine
We're tangled up in the summertime
Ooh baby, there's no pretense
The rhythm got us out our defense
Lost in the music, no emotional expense
Nights creating memories so intense
Lost in the echo of the baseline
Sweet escape where your lips meet mine
To this rhythm we align
In this dance stars realign
