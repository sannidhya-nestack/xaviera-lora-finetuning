Four thousand miles on the banana boat my daddy came
To work on London's buses and trains
From his sunny home in the Caribbean
To cold grey wetlands of the European
All of his bosses they were white
He had no equal employment rights
He'd often work fourteen hours a day
He never got promoted nor got paid
He did the jobs the whites wouldn't do
The harder he worked, the more their discrimination grew
They housed him in a dirty slum
Paid for by half of his income
Enoch Powell wanted a ministry of repatriation
Maggie Thatcher said we live in an alien nation
Racial discrimination from governmental anizations
What they wanted was deportation
Deportation, deportation
He never complained, he never cursed
His wife was an NHS nurse
She wasn't white nor a Christian
She was a hard working black woman
But was selected too for deportation
Deportation, deportation
Deportation, deportation
We're selected for deportation
They helped build London Transport and the NHS
They were deported with the rest
No one helped them fight their deportation
They never received compensation
Deportation, deportation, deportation
They never received compensation
Never received compensation, no
After thirty years they kicked them out
They didn't understand what it was all about
Government said you got no right to appeal
It wasn't a bad dream, it was real
Deportation, deportation
Deportation, deportation
Now they sit on their porch in Spanish Town
Watching the Caribbean sun go down
Still believe when told it was a new regulation
That's why they were the subject of deportation
They were the subject of racial discrimination
Practiced by a sovereign nation
Used and abused, then thrown away
Has anything changed? Who can say? Who can say?
Deportation
