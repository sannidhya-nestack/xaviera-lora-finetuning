Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Living life like a winner
Ride or die on the stage
Underneath the moonlight
Caught up in the sound and sight
Feel the rhythm in your bones
In a world of our own
We swipe to the beat
Under the tropical heat
Lost in the music
In the magic of the night
Can't deny
We're setting the world on fire
With our song, our hearts take in flight
Your eyes, they shine like the stars in the night
Moving closer holding on so tight
In this moment we're more than alright
We dance lost in a trance with the rhythm we romance
Feeling the heat from our heads to our feet in this melody we meet
When the music fades away
With the break of a new day
We'll remember this night
Under the moon's soft light
Until we dance again in the gentle twilight
In the gentle twilight
Your eyes, they shine like the stars in the night
Moving close to holding on so tight
In this moment we're more than alright
With our song our hearts taking flight
With our song our hearts taking flight
Your eyes, they shine like the stars in the night
Moving close to holding on so tight
In this moment we're more than alright
With our songs our hearts take flight
Your eyes, they shine like the stars in the night
Moving close to holding on so tight
In this moment we're more than alright
When the music fades away
With the break of a new day
We'll remember this night
Under the moons of light
Until we dance again in the gentle twilight
When you give them a real date in the channel Twilight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
