Yeah, dancing around a moonlight, yeah
Bitter in the sand
Feeling the rhythm in every move
Just take my hand
Girl, your laughter is the music
And your smile's my favorite song
With this tropical surroundings
What could possibly go wrong?
We're turning this beach into our dance floor
Ratchet our heartbeat with the tide's roar
Under the stars caught in a rhythm so pure
Our dance is the language of love, I am sure
They're turning this beach into our dance floor
Matching our heartbeat with the tides roar
Under the stars caught in Oregon's slow cure
Our dance is the language of love I am sure
Lost in the sway of palm trees
In the whisper of the wind
Your eyes they carry the ocean
Where my fears are soaked in
Your hips they move like waves
Crashing into the shore
Each step closer girl I'm lonely more
Love's melody in your sweet symphony
Caught in this rhythm feel the tropical harmony
Your every move an enchanting awe
With the night's breeze let's happily flow
We're turning this beach into our dance floor
Imagine our heartbeat with the tides roar
Under the stars caught in a rhythm so pure
Our dance is the language of love I am sure
We're turning this beach into our dance floor
Imagine our heartbeat with the tides roar
Under the stars caught in a rhythm so pure
Our dance is the language of love I am sure
So let's dance to the fries
So we can feel our feet
Just you and me girl
Who makes this moment so sweet
This isn't just a dance, it's more than a dance floor spin
It's a rhythm of love, feels like a beautiful wind
