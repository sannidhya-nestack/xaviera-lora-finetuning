Breaking underneath the sunlight
Kissing your skin so right
The rhythm of the waves
Our bodies start to sway
Sipping on the cocoa
Feet sinking in the sand
Lost in the calypso
Caught up in the love we planned
With your deep brown eyes
You're my paradise
An illusion, an escape
More than just a summer's day
Let's dance'til the moonlight fades
In this rhythm, we're not afraid
Caught in this paradise we yearn
In this dance, our love will burn
Cool breeze whispering
Salt on your sun-kissed lips
Underneath the palm trees
We're swaying our hips
We're feeling the rhythm
The island provides the sound
We know we can fight it
In our love we're bound
No more looking back
Like a record on the track
We're spinning round and round
With our feet barely touching the ground
Let's dance till the moonlight fades
In this rhythm
