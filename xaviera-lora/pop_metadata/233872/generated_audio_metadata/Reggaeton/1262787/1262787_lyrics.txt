I said that I love me out there
Darga ma do re ma ra ka mi darga
So in the dark, come on go so far dark
Martini ta ge ri pa ra ka pe barga
To me try, think I'll get out the bar
Darga ma do re ma ra ka mi darga
So in the dark, come on go so far darg
Martini ta ge ri pa ra ka pe barga
Hey girl, why you standing all alone?
Move your hips, let your body hit the zone
Sweating, break down in every move you own
Feel the beat like a king upon his throne
Shimmering lights, shining bright
Reflecting in your eyes, such a sight
We dance tonight under the tropical night
No lies, just you and me feeling right
Let's slide, move side to side
To the rhythm on this crazy ride
We're fire in the night
Burning bright, oh what a sight
With every beat our hearts collide
In this tropical rhythm let's confide
Your touch your smile can't hide
Under the moon let's keep this vibe
Turn around spin let it free
Feel the music in every spree
Fire in your eyes all I see
With you forever I want to be
Let's slide move side to side
To the rhythm of this crazy ride
We're fire in the night
Burning bright, oh what a sight
Guitars strummin', floor is hummin'
This tropical rhythm keeps us comin'
Together we dance, the world's our stage
In this pulsing beat, our bound's aged
Let's slide, move side to side
To the rhythm on this crazy ride
We're fire in the night
Burning bright, oh what a sight
As the night fades into the light
Your smile remains the most beautiful sight
Call it magic, call it tropical heat
