Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So let it restand on my silver sand
Blurring moon up above in her foreign land
It lights up the fire, cool and so clear
Under the sky, I've got nothing to fear
We're setting the night on fire
Just you me, a sweet desire
Swaying with the secrets we're about to share
This is a melody beyond compare
Ruins of old whispering tales
Under the stars as the daylight dares
With you there's no need for any disguise
Lost in love beneath Caribbean skies
We're setting the night on fire
Lost in a rhythm fueled by desire
Together we dance, there's no distance or far
Move into the beat under a falling star
Close your eyes, let the rhythm guide
