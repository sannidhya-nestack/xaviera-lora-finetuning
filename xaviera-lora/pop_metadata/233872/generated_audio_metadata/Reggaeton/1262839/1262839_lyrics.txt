I see a dancing girl under the moonlight I feel
Moving like the sea waves as the night unfurls
Swing to the rhythm let your body go
We're caught in this silent melody
Can I pop, break your tone?
Feel the beat of the drums
Let your heart collide
In this moment let's capate girl let's take a ride (take a ride)
Dance with me darling under the stars tonight (stars tonight)
In this universe of ours everything's gonna be alright (gonna be alright)
Shimmering like gold under the disco lights (disco lights)
Your laughter is a song that sets the night on fire (on fire)
The way you groove girl it feels just right (it feels just right)
I'm hypnotized by the rhythm of your dance desire (dance desire)
To the rhythm of the night
Surrender your soul (surrender your soul)
In this tropical paradise music is in control (in control)
Wave your body girl with the tide
In this heartbreak you don't ride
Let's swipe the night side
In this musical fusion where the beats are spun
This sweet symphony has only begun
With beats pulsing in the night
Under the moon so bright
This is our symphony'til the morning light
Dance with me darling, feel the rhythm of the night
In this pop record tone voyage let's take flight
Beat by beat let's set the night on fire
In this paradise of ours, you're my only desire
Oh, oh, oh, you're my only desire, can't miss
Oh, oh, oh, love is just a new rhythm
Caught in a trance, this is a song about pop, pop, break all night
Love until the sun comes up and you'll be tired
