Oro en polofa, capacom sun, hitamongan
Sweat drops falling, bodies weighing in fun
Baby your eyes they shine, brighter than the summer sky
Can't deny, it's a high, every time you and I
We dance to the rhythm, the beat of the city streets
Our hearts pounding with the tempo feeling so sweet
Can't contain this flame, it's an unending game
In the rhythm of love, we'll never be the same
Your touch on my skin, don't you feel the spin?
Lost in your eyes, it's the game we're in
Under the last glow of the setting sun
You're whispering like it's this, baby, we've just begun
We sway in the moonlight to the music street symphony
Lost in the rhythm, lost in a nice warm rising spree
Can't toss this wildfire, burning with desire
In the rhythm of love we'll never be the same, rise higher
We dance to the rhythm, the beat of the city streets
Our hearts pounding with the tempo feeling so sweet
Can't contain this flame, it's an unending game
In the rhythm of the world, we'll never be the same
Rise higher, a hint of your smile, a touch of your hand
Together we sway on this tropical land
The swaying palms, the shimmering sand
In the rhythm of the world, on this moonless strand
We dance to the rhythm falling on our love's decree
Our hearts speak a language everyone can see
Feeling the enchantment under the stars' fire
In the rhythm of love we'll dance on fire
As the night fades into breaking dawn
Still in your arms baby we dance on
The rhythm never ends, it's a feeling choir
In the rhythm of a love that forever will expire
