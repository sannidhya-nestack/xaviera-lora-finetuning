Hey girl, underneath this tropical heat
Throw hips away, send a hypnotic beat
We're caught up in a rhythm so sweet
In a dance where only our hearts meet
Dance with me under these neon lights
Where music gives wings to our nights
Together we dream of endless flights
Our spirits soaring to unimaginable heights
Our bodies move with seamless ease
Like waves crashing on distant seas
With each beat all worries cease
In this dance we find our peace
Dance with me, surrender the fight
In the rhythm we'll find our light
Our story unfolding in the night
In this dance our souls ignite
From the tropical heat we sway
To the rhythm that takes our breath away
In each other's arms we'll stay
Till the music fades at the break of day
So girl hold me tight
As we dance under the soft moonlight
To the rhythm that feels just right
In this dance we love we unite
