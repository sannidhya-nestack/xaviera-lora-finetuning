Got a rhythm in my heart, it's beating like a drum
Under the Caribbean sun, baby our story's begun
Your love is like wildfire, spreading through the night
Moving with the rhythm, our bodies feeling so right
Girl you got me high, I'm numb, your love so sweet
Sweat is dripping and I can't feel my feet
But the night is young, we just started to sway
Baby let's dance, chill our worries away
Sizzling in the heat, bodies intertwine
Your hips to the rhythm, your lips are mine
Underneath the moonlight, the stars align
This melody of love renders us divine
Here's a toast to the night, here's a toast to us
In this tropical paradise, dancing without fuss
In your eyes I see a world so bright
We keep it going from the day into the night
Feeling the heat is gripping
