In this city of noise, this city of noise
A heartbeat tonight, heartbeat tonight
Underneath the neon signs, neon signs
These shadows dancing fine, dancing fine
Feel the rhythm, feel the pace
I see the joy in your face
Let your hips sway, no restraint
To our love melody, intense
Sway with me in this crazy beat
Flow like the ocean so deep so sweet
Turn up the heat under the moon so bright
Get our rhythm off two hearts let's ignite
The night is a canvas
Painting stories untold
Stories untold
Under the stardust
Through the stardust
Feel your hand I hold
Feel your hand I hold
With every whisper in the wind
As the music spins
Let's dance away to the place of the night
Where our love begins
Love begins
Sway with me in this crazy beat
Flow like the ocean so deep, so sweet
Turn up the heat under the moon so bright
In a rhythm of two hearts, let's ignite, ignite
We ignite it
A barefoot dance on the golden sand
A love story written by our own hand
Under the veil of shimmering moonlight
Basking in your love, oh what a sight
Sway with me and let the night repeat
In the rhythm of our hearts that meet
With every sunrise and each dark twilight
Our love like the rhythm stays alike
We dance until sunrise, a dream so divine
In the rhythm of love, while your heart beats with mine
As the music fades under the morning light
Our rhythm, our dance, our love stays bright
Look at settings on canvas
Painting stories untold
Stories untold
I'm doing it my way
