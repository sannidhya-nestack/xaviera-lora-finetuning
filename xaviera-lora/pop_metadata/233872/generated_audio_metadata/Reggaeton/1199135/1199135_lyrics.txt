Half awake under stars
Hugging rainbows in my dreams
Till they spill out on the floor
By the lake counting cars
Love is rarely what it seems
But sometimes it's something more
Try to go the straight and narrow
But I got nowhere
Every day, babe, I'm walking a crooked line
Every night, babe, I'm walking a crooked line
In my own way, I'm walking a crooked line
To you, straight to you, babe
Late last night, thought I saw
Through the moonlight and the mist
Something I cannot et
Crystal white waterfall
Held two lovers in a kiss
And I saw their silhouette
Turned out what I had my eyes on
It was you on my horizon
Every day, babe, I'm walking a crooked line
Every night, babe, I'm walking a crooked line
In my own way, I'm walking a crooked line to you
Straight to you, babe
Used to think love was made for crazy fools
Just a loser's game
But since I met you, boy, I've come around
And I'm grateful I'm insane
Every day, babe
I'm walking a crooked line
Every night, babe
I'm walking a crooked line
In my own way
I'm walking a crooked line to you
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
Every day, babe, I'm walkin' a crooked line
Every night, babe, I'm walkin' a crooked line
In my own way, I'm walkin' a crooked line to you
