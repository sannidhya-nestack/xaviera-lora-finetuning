Okay, you miss her under the moonlight
Girl, your laugh is magic, darling, the night bright
Island vibe, you're sweet, just the right type
Breaking all the rules, feeling so right
But dancing on the edge of the sunrise
Laughing as the stars slowly capsize
Stealing the rhythm as our hearts synchronize
This is our moment, just you and I under the skies
Got that sweet rhythm ticking over
Your smile's melody, I'm your lover
Lost in your eyes, there's no other
Rolling with the waves like no other
We're burning in the glow of the sunset
Creating memories we'll never et
The music in our souls, our external duet
This feeling so powerful, feels like we just met
Burning in the glow of the sunset
Creating memories we'll never et
The music in our souls our eternal duet
This feeling so powerful feels like we just met
Emerald seas, golden sands
In this rhythm we hold hands
Drawn to you like a melody
Forever ingrained our song poetry
We're dancing under the trance grade of the moonlight
In this rhythm of love it feels just right
It's dark, twinkling, reflecting our delight
This song of us, it's our endless night
I'm inside and we, we found our story
I was in the rhythm, found it in glory
Just you and me and our song safari
In this eternal dance for a history
The skies create another
Got that sweet rhythm taking over
Your smiles, melody, I'm your lover
Lost in your eyes, there's no other
Rolling with the waves like no other
We're burning in the glow of the sunset
Creating memories we'll never et
The music in our souls, our eternal due way
This feeling so powerful, feels like we just met
Emerald seas, golden sands, in this rhythm
We hold hands drawn to you, like a melody forever ingrained
This feeling so powerful, feels like we just met
Emerald seas, golden sands
