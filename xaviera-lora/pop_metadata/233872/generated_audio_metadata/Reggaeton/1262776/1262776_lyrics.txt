On my way, night city sound
Walking around, no one's around
Feel the beat, start to move
In the street with no one to prove
Hearts on fire, yearning desire
Words unspoken, love ain't a liar
Dance with me, I'm down the moonlight
Got the rhythm and feeling so right
Melodies playing, our bodies swaying
This is our night, know me from LA
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Fluents begin to appear
Golden lights, music to our ear
Heat is rising, start to groove
The eyes enticing in our private alcove
Hearts racing, passions embracing
Soon we're dancing, the world we're facing
Dance with me under the moonlight
Got the rhythm feeling so right
Melodies played, our bodies swaying
This is our night, no need for delay
Lost in the rhythm, the urban city, this is our dance just you and me
Dance with me under the moonlight, got the rhythm feeling so right
Melodies playing, our bodies swaying, this is our night, no need for delay
Feel this night, feel it set the moonlight
The rhythm, feeling so right
Do you understand how I'm saying
In this dance there's no betrayal
Feel this night, feeling so divine
With the rhythm, oh so fine
Melodies fade but our hearts keep playing
In this dance there's no betraying
