There's energy when you're alone
Can't deny your got me feeling so high
Cutting you off tight
Walking on the moonlight chasing the sunrise
In the rhythm of the night with you I feel alive
Your body's warm like the tropical sun
Our hearts singing this sweet reggae song
Moving together feeling so strong
In this rhythm we belong
Oh oh we're dancing in the heat of the love
Matching the rhythm flying like a dove
Lights so bright stars above
This is our song this is our move
Late night talks, palm trees swaying on the side
Under the silver glow of the moonlight, no need to hide
Whispering secrets beneath the starry sky
With the ocean as our witness, love is our tide
So come on, move your body, feel the groove
Feel the waves, let your spirit move
This crazy love, we got nothing to prove
This is our song, this is our love, this is our move
Move your body, feel the groove
Feel the waves, let your spirit move
This crazy love, we got nothing to prove
This is our song, this is our love
This is our move
As the night fades into the dawn
Our music playing on and on
This reggae beat this gentle hum
With you it feels like home
Oh oh we're dancing in the heat of the love
Matching the rhythm flying like a dove
Lights so bright as stars above
This is our song this is our move
