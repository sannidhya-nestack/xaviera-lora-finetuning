The waves roll in, the music plays, soft fire
Your smile lights up my darkest days, gentle glow
Our bodies move in perfect time, golden haze
A love that feels like a sweet rhyme, endless vibe
Your laughter echoes through the night
Dancing sky
You're everything that feels so right
Burning a spark
We're lost in sound
Just you and me
Hit and fled
Together here where we're meant to be
Shining wave
Take my hand let's roll the floor
Timeless ride
Feel the heat and crave for more
Blazing stars
Every glance it calls me near
Silver spark
My perfect love so bright and clear
Golden dream
The waves roll in, the music plays, soft fire
Your smile lights up my darkest days, gentle glow
Our bodies move, in perfect time, golden haze
A love that feels like a sweet rhyme in this vibe
Your laughter echoes through the night, dancing sky
You're everything that feels so right, berg and spark
We're lost in sound, just you and me, hidden flame
Together here where we're meant to be, shining wave
Take my hand, let's rule the floor, timeless vibe
Feel the heat and crave for more
Blazing stars
Every glance it pulls me near
Silver spark
A perfect love so bright and clear
Golden dream
Take my hand, let's rule the floor, timeless slide
Feel the heat and crave for more, blazing stars
Every glance it pulls me near, silver spark
A perfect love, so bright and clear, golden dream
