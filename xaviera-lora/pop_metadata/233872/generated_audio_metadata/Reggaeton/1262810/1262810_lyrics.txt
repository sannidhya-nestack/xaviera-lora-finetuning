Onda no ni hljbljbljbljbljbljbl
Blerapa i stah to hum
Got me feeling so undone
Our rhythm just begun
See the way the palm trees sway
As the bass begins to play
Move your hips don't be afraid
Let the music guide your way
This is the beat of our hearts intertwined
Like a melody so sweet you and I
Under the neon skies we all rely
Swaying left to right
In tropical night
The magic of this island vibe, we're dancing in the light
Our spirits soaring high, on fire with passion's light
Sequins glimmer in your eyes, the night is lost no lies
Just let the beat hypnotize, ain't no need for but goodbyes
This is the beat of our hearts combined
Like a melody in a perfect rhyme
Under the neon skies we feel so alive
Lost in the rhythm in tropical night
No time to sleep it's the rhythm we seek
All through the night'til the morning light peak
This love, this sound our hearts have found
In this paradise we're paradise bound
This is the rhythm of love undefined
Like a melodic, so cated melody we excite
Under the neon moon we shine so bright
Dance until dawn in tropical night
So here we are, beneath the stars, where love leaves no scars
Just beating hearts created in art, in this exotic paradise
You and I, we pay no price, just living free, in tropical night
So here we are beneath the stars where love leaves no scars
Our spirits soaring high on fiery passion flight
Sequence glimmer in your eyes the night is ours no lies
Just let the beat hypnotize ain't no need for good goodbyes
This is the beat of our hearts combined
Like a melody in a perfect rhyme
Under the neon
