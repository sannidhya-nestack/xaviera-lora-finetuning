You and I, I, I, I, I
Late night city sights, we're dancing on the street lights
With your hand in mine, feels like we can stop the time
Your eyes hold a story and our laughter is the glory
Together we're exploring, we're just getting started
Sway with me under the palm trees in the tropical moonlight
Move so sweet can't skip a beat, feels oh so right
This melody filling me with pure delight
Living in the rhythm we're a dynamite
With your silhouette in the sunset casting shadows as we sway
We move and twine lose track of time in this coastal ballet
In the salty breeze we dance with ease letting go of yesterday
Creating memories in this ocean serenade
Dive with me underneath the stars where the waves unite
With your heartbeat next to me under the Latin night
The symphony in perfect harmony in the soft moonlight
Caught in the rhythm we're a dynamite
In this dance we find romance under the sky's dome
Hundreds of miles from home, yet it feels like our own
Spin with me in the sand where the sea meets the light
In the moonlit heat our hearts repeat the rhythm of the night
