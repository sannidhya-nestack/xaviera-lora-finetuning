I see you're dancing, end of the moonlight
Sway to the beat, with your eyes so bright
We're in the city where the stars don't shine
But with you here everything's just fine
Feeling the rhythm, it's in your soul
Reggaeton vibes taking control
Your laughter rings in the still night air
Our hearts seeking in the rhythm, nothing to compare
Move with me into the night
In this rhythm, we find our light
Hold on tight, feel the surge
To the heartbeat, let our hearts emerge
Energy high, body's close
Lost in the rhythm, we find the utmost
Salsa inspired, under the dim lights
With you, every night's worth the fight
Reggaeton vibes, top beat divine
We're living this moment, you're our hand in mine
Through the rhythm, our spirits meet
You and I, endlessly moving our feet
Move with me into the night
In this rhythm, we find our light
Dancing wildly under the stars' range
In the world of music, we are the change
