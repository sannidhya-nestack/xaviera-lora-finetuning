Underneath the palm trees, caught in the sea breeze
Your sparkling eyes, brighter than the stars gleam
We're swaying in rhythm, velvet night's kingdom in the soft shadow
We're living this dream
We dance to the rhythm slow then fast
Our hearts beating in time this night ain't the last
Just let the music bring us close don't let go
Summer's melody flash like electro
Bronze by the sunlight what an enchanting sight
Whispers of secrets carried by the night
Let the drums capture our hearts' grip
In this tropical charm, lose ourselves and drift
Oh, moving to a beat under the moon so bright
Lost in the rhythm, in the glow of twilight
Hands intertwine, your touch sends chills down my spine
This is our paradise, your heart next to mine
Sunset hues paint the skyline over the horizon
Your silhouette so divine with sand between our toes and salt in our hair
Silhouettes fading into the flaming air
Enchanted by the rhythm, hypnotized by the night
Summer's magic, our love ignites
In the heat of passion, beneath the starry cloak
In the rhythm of the night, we dance and we evoke
