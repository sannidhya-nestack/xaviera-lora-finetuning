Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm (Na-na-na-na, whoa-na-na-na, na-na-na)
Golden skin, pearls on ice
Samba moon paradise
He say mami tu e bella
I laugh, oh boy I can tell
Coconuts and sweet and wild
Lights and fire, Paris style
Every move just burning slow
Love in stereo
Mi corazón don't need no king
Just rhythm, body, diamond ring
Baila baby
Feel the bliss, ain't no night like this
Champagne nights when I move
Dance till we can't no more
From Rio streets to Cote D'azur
You touch me, soul shut the door
Champagne nights when I move
Dance till we can't no more
From Rio streets to Cote D'azur
You touch me, soul shut the door
Yeah, she twist, she shine, caramel tone
Speak three tones, breakin' my phone
Dominicana from Marseille zone
Say papi slow but I lose control
Pour the bottle, don't stop the flame
We don't do love, we play the game
Cherry lips, golden chain
Riding rhythm, say my name
Nico Razon don't need no king
Just rhythm, body diamond ring
Bye-bye baby, feel the bliss
Ain't no night like this
Champagne, ice, mon amour
Dance'til we can't no more
From Rio streets to Côte d'Azur
You touch me so je t'adore
Champagne, ice, mon amour
Dance'til we can't no more
From Rio streets to Côte d'Azur
You touch me so je t'adore
Tu veux danser encore?
Don't stop, mon amour
Let the moon says burn
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Now the lights fade low, music still inside my bones
Cherry, you know this night never ends
Champagne dreams and we pretend
