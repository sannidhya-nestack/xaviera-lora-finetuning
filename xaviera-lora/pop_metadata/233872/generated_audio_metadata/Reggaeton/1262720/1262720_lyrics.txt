Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lookin' up under this tropical sun
You with your rhythm and I lookin' for fun
With your hips swingin' like the waves on the sea
I feel the beat with you in this melodic stream
Our hearts are pulsating onto the dance floor we glide
Caught in the Latin beat with emotions we can't hide
Your silhouette against the moon, a sight I can't deny
In your arms, under the stars, let this night testify
We are dancing, we are swaying under the neon light
In this rhythm of the night, you and I bend and glide
Facing the rhythm, like a sweep of bedding fluid
Our bodies are talking, no, I look for minions
Yeah, in your eyes, I can see the mountains and the shore
The dance we explore is you who I adore
Your whispers in the wind, promises of the dawn
In this moment, I'll sing you the perfect song
Dancing swaying under the spotlight's glare (light's glare)
In the rhythm of love, love, love, entangled in your stare (stare)
Dance in the rhythm, melody so right
With you in this dance into the endless night
We are dancing, we are swaying under the neon light
In this rhythm of the night, you and I burning bright
Tasting the rhythm like a sweet forbidden food
Our bodies are talking, though our lips remain mute
In your arms, under the stars, let this night testify
We are dancing, we are swaying under the neon light
In this rhythm of the night, you and I burning bright
Tasting the rhythm like it's sweet forbidden food
Our bodies are talking, though all that's remaining is
In your arms, under the stars, let this night testify
In your eyes, I can see the mountains and the shore
The dance we explore, it's you who I adore
You're with pleasant moon and promises of the dawn
In this moment our hearts singing the perfect song
In your eyes, I can see the mountains and the shore
The dance we explore, it's you who I adore
Feeling the rhythm of your sweet forbidden fruit
Our bodies are talking though our lips remain mute
In your eyes I can see the mountains and the shore
The dance we explore is you who I adore
Your whispers in the wind promises of the dawn
In this moment our hearts singing the perfect song
Dancing swaying under the spotlight spread
In the rhythm of love as you hold to your step
Feeling the rhythm
I'm the light, it's alright
We'll heal in this dance into the endless night
Under the palm trees
As the sun begins to rise
See the rhythm of love reflected in your eyes
With every beat, every move, every dance, every song
In this rhythm of life, in the queue I belong
