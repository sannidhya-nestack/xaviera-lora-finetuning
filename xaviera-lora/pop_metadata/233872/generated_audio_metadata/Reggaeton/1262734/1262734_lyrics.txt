A little bit of your color in neon lights
Dancing in the warmth of salty nights
Hips sway to the rhythm oh so slow
Got this feeling I just can't let go
Your eyes they mystify
The way they blend with moonlit sky
This last new vibe
Our bodies grooving
Something about it so, so, so soothing
With the rhythm, feel the heat
Our bodies moving to the same beat
Midnight whispers making us high
In the pulsing rhythm of sultry night
Cools and counters as we dance so near
The taste of tropical dreams in the air
See salt and summer singing in unison
Living in the music'til the night is gone
This light's invite, our bodies groovin'
Something about it's so, so, so soothing
With the rhythm, feel the heat
Our bodies moving to the same beat
Midnight whispers making us high
In the pulsing rhythm of sultry night
Taste the rhythm, savor the night
Under the stars, oh what a sight
Whispered promises, dancing just right
Awaken by the rhythm of this sultry night
As sunlight paints the sky
Forefront to the morning tide
We'll remember this melody bright
Forever captive in this sultry night
Hit the rhythm, feel the heat, our bodies moving to the same beat
Midnight whispers making us high in the pulsing rhythm, the sultry night
