Why would you put so much energy into something that eventually is going to fail? (Oh nah nah nah)
Well, yai yai (heh heh) (Motif) I hope this song makes any sense to you
Can someone call a doctor?
Cause she shot me through my heart again
I really need a doctor
To take this pain I feel away
I know you were the devil since the first day I laid my eyes on you
I know you give me trouble since the first day I put my arms around you girl
What was I thinking
What a big mistake
Now the time is coming done
You never give me back (too late too late)
Because it's too late too late (too late too late)
Too late to give my love (too late too late)
Now it's too late too late (too late too late)
Too late to be the one (too late, too late)
Too late, too late (too late, too late)
Now it's too late to give my love (too late, too late)
Too late, too late
Too late, too late to be the one
You know you hypnotize me, everything you do
You know you drive me crazy every time I see you
I can't explain what I've been doing with you for so long
You know you hypnotize me, everything you do
You know you drive me crazy every time I see you
I think it's time for me to pack my things and just move on
I can do better, I can do better than you
And you can do whatever, whatever you wanna do
I can do better, I can do better than you
And you can do whatever
I promise not to follow you (too late, too late)
Because it's too late, too late (too late, too late)
Too late to give my love (too late, too late)
Now it's too late, too late (too late too late)
Too late to be the one (too late, too late)
Too late, too late (too late, too late),
Now it's too late to give my love (too late, too late)
Too late, too late, too late, too late to be the one
You know you hypnotize me, everything you do
You know you driving me crazy every time I see you
I can't explain what I've been doing with you for so long
You know you hypnotize me, everything you do
You know you driving me crazy every time I see you
I think it's time for me to pack my things and just go home (Baby, baby, baby girl I gotta go)
I gotta find my own home (woo)
I gotta do this on my own
I cannot believe that I'm saying this but I don't want to see you anymore
I got to go, I ain't got no time to wait
I've been in this place, I've seen everything that I need to see
Trying to be the man I'm supposed to be
Because it's too late too late
Too late to give my love (too late, too late)
Now it's too late, too late (too late, too late)
Too late to be the one (too late, too late)
Too late, too late (too late, too late),
Now it's too late to give my love (too late, too late)
Too late, too late
Too late, too late to be the one
