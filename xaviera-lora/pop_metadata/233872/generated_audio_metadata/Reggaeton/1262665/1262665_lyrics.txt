But there's a moon tonight
In this fabric of paradise
Silhouette eyes
Silhouette dancing
Oh so nice
Music's playing
Hearts ignite
Lost in the rhythm
Through the night
In the pulse of the beat, love takes flight
In this paradise, in the damn neon
When your music's playing, can't deny
We're dancing close under the starry sky
Your hips don't lie, they move with grace
Lost in the rhythm, I see your face
Close enough, your breath on my skin
In this dance of desire, love sweeps in
The rhythm of love still unfolds
In your arms, passion so bold
Music's playing, hearts collide
In this dance of sweet time
In the stars, we sway so close
In your eyes, I see love's dose
Music's playing, hearts collide
In this dance, love's sweet tie
As the night falls, the music dims
But I dance along, it never ends
In the rhythm, memories trace
In this dance, love's embrace
Your hips don't lie, they move with grace
Lost in the rhythm, I see your face
Closer now, your breath on my skin
And in this dance of desire, love sweetens
Don't lie, they move with grace
Lost in the rhythm, I see your face
Closer now, your breath on my skin
And in this dance of desire, love's sweet sin
Your hips don't lie, they move with grace
Lost in the rhythm, I see your face
Closer now, your breath on my skin
And in this dance of desire, love's sweet sin
Been with us all night, we move with grace
Lost in the rhythm, I see your face
Closing out your breath on my skin
Within this dance of desire, love sweet sin
