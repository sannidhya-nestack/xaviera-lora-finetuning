In this midnight light
There's a rhythm that we're feeling
Hot summer night
Got our hearts drummin' spinnin'
Move your body to the beat
Let your spirits dance
Tonight we're free
Caught in this trance
In the soft flow
Under the starry veil
We dance to the rhythm
With no one to tell
As the melody hits, we soar in the sky
In the music of our hearts we fly
Under the palm trees in the heart of the human
Feeling the ocean breeze, it's a tropical dream then
Your eyes meet mine, in the rhythm of the night
Together we shine, we ignite, we ignite
We'll play the moon above, in the passionate tide
We'll dance to the rhythm, with nowhere to hide
As the rain drops, we reach to the sky
In this harmony of love we comply
With your hands in mine, we're unbreakable
Under the moonlight every move is capable
In the rhythm of the silence, under the city lights
With the sound of our hearts we ignite
In the dark palm trees, in the heart of the evening
We dance to the rhythm
With no words to tell it's true
As the money hits
We soar in the sky
In the music of our hearts we fly
Under the palm trees in the heart of heaven
Feeling the ocean breeze, it's a tropical dreamin'
Your eyes meet mine, in the rhythm of the night
Together we shine, we ignite, we fly
Under the palm trees, in the heart of the pavement
Feeling the ocean breeze, it's a tropical dream in
Your eyes meet mine
In the rhythm of the night
Together we shine, we ignite
We come together, we shine
Face the moon above, in a passionate tide
We dance to the rhythm, no matter how high
As the beat drops, we reach to the sky
In this harmony of love, we comply
With your hands and mind
We're unbreakable, under the moonlight
Every move is capable
In the rhythm of the silence, under the city lights
With this harmony of love
