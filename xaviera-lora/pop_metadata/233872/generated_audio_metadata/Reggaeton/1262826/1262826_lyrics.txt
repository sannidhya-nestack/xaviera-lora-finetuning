Beneath the urban moonlight as the city sleeps
Your touch is like a melody that my heart keeps
Dancing close to you feeling the island heat
In this rhythm of the night even silence speaks
Just keep moving, just keep swaying
In the heat of the night, no need for playin'
Two hearts in sync like a perfect song
In an island beat where we both belong
Your home
Your voice whispers softly as the waves crash
You're the addictive rhythm, my favorite night clash
In the beat of the city under the starlight so bright
With every Latin beat you feel just right
