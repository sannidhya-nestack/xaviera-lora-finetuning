Tonight, I got a dizzy delight (delight)
We're dancing, lost in each other's sight (sight)
Your body moves gracefully, so serenely
Woven into the beat, so dreamily
We're dancing caught in the rhythm divine (divine)
Your body so close and intertwined with mine
With the sunset hues our love story ensues
In the rhythm of the night there's just me and you
Your laughter goes with the beat of the drum
Every distant turn to the rhythm we succumb
Feeling the pulse the rhythm so alive
With every heartbeat our love will survive
We're moving lost in the rhythm of the night (of the night)
Stars as our guide, everything feels right (feels right)
With the new sorrow, we're letting ourselves go (ourselves go)
To live on with love, we're letting it show
The light is young, our song unsung
In your eyes, I feel I belong
Through laughter and tears, overcoming the fear
In the rhythm of love, everything becomes clear
We're dancing by, it's swaying in time
Beneath the stars, it feels so sublime
The night in bloom, there is no room for gloom
In the rhythm of love, our hearts go through
As the night grows old, our story told
In the rhythm of love, we're so bold
Even as the music ends, in my heart it transcends
Our dance eternal, on this it all depends
Feel nothing lost in the rhythm of the night
Stars as our guide, everything feels right
Like the moons soft glow, we're letting ourselves go
The rhythm with love, we're letting it show
