Got that spice
Living life moving to the rhythm oh
Underneath the moonlight dancing like no tomorrow
Hey skin against the worms and got you wrapped within my head
Yeah playing our favorite song
Body swaying along
Right lined up to the beat
Feel the heat under our feet
Moving to the rhythm
Caught in this euphoria
Can't deny it, we're setting the night alight
Just keep singing, keep swinging'til the morning light
Vibes so sweet up on your feet, feeling the tropical heat, oh
Mixed with your smile, can't spot you from a mile, hey
In this paradise, no need to roll the dice
Yeah, sustain the pulse of the night, heart's taking flight
Bailando heart pounding rhythm sounds like Latino drumming closer in the moonlight
You and me igniting this delight
Can't stop this, we're making tropical bliss
Just keep moving, keep grooving'til the dawn's first kiss
