Shedding a beat under the sun
Moving my hips to the rhythm so fine
Colors are swirling, the party's begun
A splash of tequila, no need to run
We're dancing, we're swaying, lost in the night
Caught up in the rhythm, it feels so right
Blending of vibes, a tropical delight
With the beat of the drums, we take flight
Palm trees are swaying, moon shining bright
Her eyes are stars reflecting the night
Whisper and sleep, nothing's under the light
Our bodies in sync, it's a beautiful sight
We'll dance and we'll sway in this paradise
Just you and me and the roll of the dice
Savoring moments, no thinking twice
With the rhythm of love, oh it's so nice
Hot sand, cool waves, play this game
In the heat of the night, you call my name
Cocktails and dreams, nobody to blame
In this reggaeton night, we're a flame
We're dancing, we're swaying, wrapped in the night
Caught up in the rhythm, it feels so right
Turned into vibes, it's typical delight
With the beat of the drums, we take flight
We're dancing, we're swaying, wrapped in the night
Caught up in the rhythm, it feels so right
Turned into vibes, it's typical delight
With the beat of the drums, we take flight
As the night fades with the break of dawn
Our bodies tied but the connection's strong
Keep this memory as a favorite song
In this moment is where we belong
