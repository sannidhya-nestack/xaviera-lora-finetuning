To be a soul
Greetings
Greetings
First we hit'em low, then we hit'em high
Underrated but we made it to the finish line
Rhymes designed to combine and intertwine
Spring to the summer, fall even winter time
Beats banging harder than head-on collisions
We make incisions with precision and quick decisions
Causing double visions if you ain't up to speed
You need to speed it up, partner, Keanu Reeves
Life is great when you dominate
Shine and make the haters hate
So you can appreciate
Life is great when you dominate
You reach your final hours, minutes, second last days
Snow storms backed up with a heat wave
Nobody stays the same and everything is different
Parallel dimensions shifted soon as I ripped it
Skills on the microphone you getting analyzed
Under microscopes like DNA and chromosomes
These suckas are pathetic my energy kinetic
Soon as I said it don't follow and you shall regret it
Life is great when you dominate
Shine and make the hate a hate
So you can appreciate
Life is great when you dominate
Freedom
Freedom
Get up
Listen
Well here you are song boy, mix that up a little bit a little sweeter make the people a get nicer, quicker, ahhhh
Well here it is, original, strictly original music and the play is indeed the play of rock and a lie, yeah, go go
Life is great when you dominate
Shine and make the haters hate
So you can appreciate
Life is great when you dominate
Life is great when you dominate
Shine and make the haters hate
So you can appreciate
Life is great when you dominate
Life is great when you down baby
Shine a light ahead, ahead
So you can appreciate
Life is great when you down baby
Life is great when you down baby
Shine a light ahead, ahead
So you can appreciate
Life is great when you down baby
