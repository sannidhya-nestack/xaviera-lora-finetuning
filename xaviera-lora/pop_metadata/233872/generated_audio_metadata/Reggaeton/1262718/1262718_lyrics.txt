Can you feel it, it's a rhythm that never lies
Down the streets of San Juan, under tropical skies
Got the sandals on and the water's edge in sight
Dancing'til dawn, in the soft moonlight
Oh we're swaying with the palm trees moving to the beat
Lost in the echoes of our hearts repeat
In the shining stars beneath the moon so bright
This is our time so let's ignite
It's gently crashing
Music is in the air
Underneath these stars it feels like a fair
Shimmering ocean moonlight so clear
Feeling the harmony
Leaving behind no fear
Now we're dancing in the waves under the sunset hue
This melody in our hearts feels so true
Firing our souls
Ready to ignite
One love, one rhythm
We hold on too tight
Firing our souls
Ready to ignite
From the beaches to the hustle
City lights, gradient canvas
It's an island dream, no need to make a fuss
As the night falls and the music starts to play
In these coastal melodies we sway
Oh we're swaying with the palm trees moving to the beat
Lost in the echoes of our hearts repeat
In the shining stars beneath the moon so bright
This is our time so let's ignite
Waves should be crashing
Music is in the air
Underneath these stars it feels like a fair
Shimmering ocean moonlight so clear
Feeling the harmony
Leaving behind the fear
Now we're dancing in the waves under the sunset hue
This melody in our hearts feels so true
Fire in our souls, ready to ignite
One love, one rhythm, we hold on too tight
