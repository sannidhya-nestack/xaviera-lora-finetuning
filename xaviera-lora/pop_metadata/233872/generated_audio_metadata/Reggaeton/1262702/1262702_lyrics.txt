Glossary cool
And look at the rhythm
Ain't doing it fine
Lidan na ki panchna
We eat the heat of the summer sun
Girl don't you feel the rhythm
Palm trees swaying bodies laying
On the beach we're giving
Throwing away all of our worries
Lost in the ocean view
Your golden skin your radiant smile
Everything's better with you
Got my heart beat sinking to the beat
Feeling the sand beneath our feet
Your eyes sparkle brighter than the summer sky
With you it's a paradise, oh my
Dance with me in the moonlight
In this tropical vibe, feel just right
Move your body, lose control
Let the rhythm take your soul
Saltier and cocktail sunset reflecting in your shades
Caught up in this rhythm could be lost in it for days
The music's pulses in our veins our bodies tangled tight
This pulsing beat our dancing feet will chase the endless night
Dancing close under the stars
Feeling the rhythm no matter where we are
Just let go, feel the flow
In the music we'll lose control
In the neon night the world takes flight
Move into a beat that feels so right
With every step we're free
Caught up in this tropical spree
