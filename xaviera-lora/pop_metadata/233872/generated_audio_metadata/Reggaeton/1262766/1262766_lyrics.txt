Underneath the endless sunset, your reach is all I crave
Heartbeat syncs to rhythm like waves upon the pave
Palm trees in the backdrop, our souls begin to rave
In this dance, subtle, creating love's enclave
One look into your eyes, I'm caught in your spell
Caught in this rhythm, our symphony will tell
Playing sweet Latino tunes as our hearts swell
This night's written in the stars and the tale we dwell
Skin on skin, electric touch under the moon's glow
Salty air, tropical flare as the warm winds blow
Your arms around my waist, moving sweet and slow
This dance with you, in rhythms only we know
The beat is our language, the melody our speech
In this dance of desire, where heaven we reach
Caught in the moment where the world can't breach
In the rhythm of love, a tale we'll each teach
Hold me close tonight, under the moonshell
In this dance of love, where rhythm casts its spell
Playing those sweet Latino tunes where memories dwell
This night song in our hearts this song knows so well
As the sun begins to rise our silhouettes in light
This slice of paradise kissed by the morning bright
Our hearts still dancing holding on to the night
In the rhythm of us love sweet respite
I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you, I'm dead to you,
