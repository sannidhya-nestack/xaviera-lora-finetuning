Underneath my moonlight I dip in the starry beige
Caught in the rhythm can't keep the night at age
You're a girl of the city that never sleeps
Follow the beat where the night creeps
Come on baby hold on to me
Do the music we'll break free
In sync with the beat
Come on let's sway till the light takes the night away
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh
Building up the tension in the sultry night
Heat rising up awaiting for the first light
Salted grains mingling with our desires
In our hearts it lights the fires getting closer
Let the rhythm trace the love between us
In this open space with the music loud we move together
In this paradise forever and ever
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We dance, we move in love's sweet game
Each beat of the music calling our name
In this rhythm our love takes flight
An endless dance deep into the night
Move with me
Feel the rhythm and the heat
In this eternal dance our hearts beat
Together we're lost in this rhythm called man's
Time stops as we continue to dance
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Unhold hope, oh
As the night fades to the morning glare
Our rhythm remains love filled in the air
In starlight or sunrise love knows no stance
This is our story our eternal dance
I'm falling off, I'm falling off, I'm falling
