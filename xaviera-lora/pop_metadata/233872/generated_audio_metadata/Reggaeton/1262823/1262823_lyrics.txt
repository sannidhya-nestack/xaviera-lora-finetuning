Underneath the city lights
We get that feeling right
Caught up in the music lost in the beat so tight
Your eyes they light my world
Set everything so bright
We sway together in a rhythm no end in sight
Come on babe let's heat it up
Feel the rhythm don't let it stop
Nobody around us as we move to the drop
On this tropical night, with the stars burning bright
We're dancing away,'til the morning light
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Your smile it glows, matching the sundown hue
Our foot falls in sync, as if on cue
The bass is our heartbeat, the melody our guide
We twirl and sway, in this musical tide
Yes baby we're lighting it up, caught in this rhythmic hop
This night's all about us, we ain't ever gonna flop
Bathed in moonlight, with the world taking flight
We dance away into the morning light
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Feel the heat, listen to the drums roll
This dance is our language speaking to our soul
Under the night sky we're dancing
