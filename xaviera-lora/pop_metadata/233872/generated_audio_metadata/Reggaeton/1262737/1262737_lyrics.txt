Walking on the beach, under the moonlight
Your eyes catch as the stars fade by
See from the black lines on the shadowed line
In a world where everything feels right
Whisper to me as you pull me close
On this windswept beach where time slows
Only you and me, lost in this fiery dance
With every step we drown deeper into a trance
Dancing under the stars, running with the waves
With every beat our love misbehaves
Just you and me in the deep blue sea
In this tropical night where we're just free
The warm breeze carries the rhythm along
The crashing waves sing a love song
Your body close to mine swaying with the groove
Under the starlit sky we find our move
Dancing under the stars wrapping with the waves
Whatever be our love misbehaves
Just you and me in the deep blue sea
In this tropical night where we're just free
As the rhythm builds, our bodies collide
On this tropical beach with the rising tide
With every touch, with every glance
We're lost in this perfect dance
Dancing under the stars, rubbing with the waves
With every beat, our love misbehaves
Just you and me in the deep blue sea
In this tropical night where we're just free
The night ends, the sun begins to rise
But the rhythm stays, the feeling never dies
With nothing but love in this beachside town
The music fades, but our love goes on
But night ends and sun begins to rise
But the rhythm stays and feeling never dies
Nothing in love in this beachside town
Goes it fades but our love goes on
