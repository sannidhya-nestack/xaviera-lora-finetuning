Caught in the rhythm under the moonlight
Your dancing silhouette my only sight
Your laughter brings stars and my heart takes flight
In this melodic tide love ignites
Tropical rhythm meets urban delight
In this dance of ours, setting the night alight
Just you and me lost in the summer night
Dance to the rhythm, feel all the love ignite
Wild heartbeats matching the drumbeat
Your eyes, my serenade, feel so sweet
Island winds carry our whispered retreat
In the echoes of the waves our hearts meet
Fiery skies echoes of our lost feet
Every beat, every rhythm, love repeats
Underneath the canopy
