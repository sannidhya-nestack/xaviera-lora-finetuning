Baby, I drive me crazy on the desert moonlit night
Hop in, let's take a ride
Your love feels so right
We're dancing on sandy beaches with our feet bare
Your touch is electric, baby, floating in the midair
Love to be curious away under the dancing light
Body cross your body lose your control so tight
This way with the rhythm another subway scene
Can't resist your charm in your arms is where I wanna be
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Your eyes sparkle lighten up the Caribbean skies
You whisper in my ears, louder than the oceans cries
Tropical breeze carries your scent, sweet and divine
Living in this moment with you, sipping this sun kissed wine
Feeling the heat, let the room take its peak
In this sultry night, it's your touch that I seek
With your sway and twist, we're riding our destiny
In this pop reggaeton rhythm, we set our spirits free
Oh, now be curious away under the dancing light
Got the beat, carry us away under the dancing light
Body close to body, losing control, oh so tight
We sway with the rhythm under the silvery sea
Can't resist your charm, in your arms is where I wanna be
Here in the heat, looking at the Caribbean skies
You whisper in my ears louder than the ocean's cries
Tropical breeze carries you so sweet and divine
Living in this moment with you sitting here sun kissed wine
I'll make the whole sun kiss heart
I'm the sepia sun
Healing the heat, let the rhythm take its peak
In this sultry night, it's the touch that I seek
With a swaying twist, we're riding our destiny
In this pop reggaeton rhythm, we set our spirits free
All right, up to me
Oh, you're in the heat, let the rhythm take its beat
In this sultry night, it's your touch that I seek
With each swaying twist, we're riding our destiny
In this pop reggaeton rhythm, rhythm, we set our spirits free
