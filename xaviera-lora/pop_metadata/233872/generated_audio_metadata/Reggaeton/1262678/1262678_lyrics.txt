You know I need an omelette, I know I need an omelette
To the power drills, moving to the beat
Yo te veo chitero, ya roto down trees
The rhythm of a lovely shed
Bloomin' in the wind and awake to the clouds just moving to the beat
Get the couch, get out, shout out to dumb trees with the rhythm of a lovely chair
Topical rhythm feeling the heat underneath the palm trees moving to the beat
Your sparkling eyes reflecting the sun with every dance a new love song begun
Shake, shake it under the moonlight dance dance away into the starry night
Feel the sand beneath your feet this is our song make your heart skip a beat
On you no more, no one here, no mind to the power tools moving to the beat
You the devil, you the rose, you are of the brown trees, the rhythm of the love we share
Oni me no mo e no ani ano e
The cow tails moving to the beat
Yutadio chikadio sharoto palm trees
The rhythm of the lovely shed
Latin vibes mixed with sweet pop
Cultural fusion that won't stop
Conversing in rhythms and talking in beats
In a fish's love story the music repeats
Twist twist
In the warm breeze
Move, move to the rhythm with ease
Flirting in elegies caught in a trance
This is our moment, time for romance
One in a million, one in a million
To the power tools moving to the beat
You're the girl to get up, she has not the boundaries
The rhythm of love we share
One in a million, one in a million
To the power tools moving to the beat
You're the girl to get up, she has not the boundaries
The rhythm of love we share
If we'd be drawing us close, connecting our hearts
In the rhythm of love where the magic starts
Where the magic starts
Sway, sway, under the stars
Go feel, feel the rhythm, let it flow
This is our time, this is our chance
In the rhythm of love, time for the last dance
One need no man, no one need no man to the power
