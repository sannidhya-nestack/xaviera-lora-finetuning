I'd much rather hear the rain
I already know where my heart wants to go
I try to cover up the rain
I just wanna roll over in my mind again
In my brain, in my mind's eye
I can hide inside the rain
My tears just wanna fall so I need to keep them on the outside
Lookin' ahead
I don't know when it'll take a while to be gone
Take a while to be gone
But I can't control
This rising and falling down
I'm trying not to get down
Oh yeah, I can't take it
No, this song knows when I won't stop
I keep going on and on and on
If the rain will stop
Rain that I see in the sun
I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can' believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, as I walk down the street
The trees are hanging low as they speak to me slowly
And this pause in my face reminds me of what just got away, just got away
God waiting in heaven
I'm washing away
This rain ain't coming down
I'm trying not to drown
I'll follow again
I'll keep singing this song
No one will stop
I'll keep going on and on
If the rain stops
Then you'll see the sun
I feel the love
I hear the rain, I hear the rain
(I hear the rain)
(I hear the rain)
I hear the rain, I hear the rain
