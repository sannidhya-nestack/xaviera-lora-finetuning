Can you feel it in the air tonight?
City's throbbing and me, I'm high
It's just you and me, dancing free
In the realm of melody
See the ocean in your eyes
Underneath the starlit skies
Sunset's hues wrapped around us
In the rhythm of love, in the rhythm of trust
Listen to the beat, feeling so high
Underneath the spell of the moonlit sky
In this magnetic pool we're drawn
In the rhythm of love until the break of dawn
City sounds are a lullaby
Stars above are only sky
In the dim light you're allure
Moments of capture moments we ensure
Facades fade all's bare
In the rhythm of the night we share
Under the gentle touch of moonlight
You and I sunshine so bright
Moving with the rhythm feeling the heat
Under the stars I song on repeat
In the sweet flavor of this moment drawn
Wrapped in the rhythm of love until the break of dawn
Moving with the rhythm, feeling the heat under the stars, a song on repeat
In the sweet flavor of this moment, drawn
Wrapped in the rhythm of love until the break of dawn
In the ocean of stars, just you and me
Dancing to the rhythm as sweet as it could be
