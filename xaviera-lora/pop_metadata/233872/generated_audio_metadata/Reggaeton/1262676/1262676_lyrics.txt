Hey girl, I'd rather count the sun
Dancing in the heat today has just begun, yeah
You move with a rhythm that no one else can see
It's the way you're living sets my heart free
Sipping mojitos as we move to the beat
Feeling the sand right beneath our feet
But your life got back up, so how sweet it sounds
Underneath the palm trees, love is all around
In the rhythm of the night
We'll dance until the dawn
Under those Caribbean lights
We'll sway, we'll sway on
In the rhythm of the night
Our hearts will play that song
A beat that feels so right
All night long
Fire in your eyes
Passion in your soul
As the music flows you take control
Cascading waves washing over the shore
We dance like we never danced before
Whispering secrets only the moon ever knows
Ever in the sunset in your summer clothes
As the stars twinkle in the endless sky
Your smile is the answer to the question why
In the rhythm of the night
We'll dance until the dawn
Under those Caribbean lights
We sway, we sway on
In the rhythm of the night
Our hearts will play that song
A beat that feels so right
All night long
In the rhythm of the night
If you have the money, we'll dance until the dawn
Under those Caribbean lights, we sway, we sway on, on
In the rhythm of the night, our hearts play that song
A beat that feels so right, all night long
In the rhythm of the night (ever)
We'll dance until the dawn
Under those Caribbean lights (the dawn)
We sway, we sway on and on (we sway)
In the rhythm of the night (ever)
Our hearts will play that song
A beat that feels so right (ever)
All night long
Oh girl let's dance like there's no tomorrow
In this tropical paradise et all sorrow
With the rhythm of the night under the sleepy moon
Let's promise we'll be back here soon
Red eye in the rhythm of the night
We'll dance until the dawn
Under those Caribbean lights
We sway, we sway on, oh, in the rhythm of the night
