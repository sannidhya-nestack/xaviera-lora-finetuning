You're like poison, I bleed
When I leave you alone, I'm okay
You're like poison, I bleed
When I let you touch me, I pay
'Cause when I scratch just a little
It takes so long to go away
You're like poison ivy, yeah yeah
You're like poison ivy
You get so, so onto my skin
Poison ivy
When you cross my path I can't win
No matter how tight I wear my clothes, oh
Darling, you always get in
You're like poison ivy, yeah, yeah
You're always leaving your mark on me
Hey, I gotta tread so carefully
Brush up against me and then you'll see
I'm as gone as I can be
Ooh yeah
You're like poison I've been
You do something to my blood
I can't resist you darling
My heart is pumping up with love
I'll meet you in the bushes
I'll even get down in the mud
Hey, all my poison
I get itchy just looking at you
Oh, I won't touch it, I know I'm through
Are you hot and bothered too?
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do, baby?
Like poison ivy
I get so itchy darling
Like poison ivy
I got it bad
You got a subcutaneous effect on me
You're my poison
