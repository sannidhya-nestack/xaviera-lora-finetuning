You heard about the jack of diamonds
You heard about the ace of spades
But when you see the queen of hearts go down
You know you got it made
You may not play poker
Or play that blackjack game
But when you've played that losing hand
You'll hang your head in shame
In my hands are diamonds
That's enough for any man
When I hold the queen of hearts
Now that's a winning hand
Once I was a joker, and I was running wild
Got mixed up with the greener clubs, and now I've changed my style
You heard about the jack of diamonds, you heard about the ace of spades
But when you see the queen of hearts go down
You know you got it made
In my hands are diamonds
That's enough for any man
When I hold the queen of hearts
Well that's a winning hand
In my hands are diamonds, that's enough for any man
When I hold the queen of hearts, now that's a winning hand
Yes, that's a winning hand, I tell you, that's a winning hand
