Don't let him affect you, don't let him affect you
Don't let him affect you anymore
Don't let him stress you, don't let him redirect you
Don't steer your ship towards the shore
Please keep, keep your peace
It's awful, looks like paradise
A condemnation ain't worth the price
Don't lend an ear, don't volunteer
Don't draw near, don't compromise
We'll let it rob you of your house and home
Don't let her tempt you, don't let her tempt you
Don't let her tempt you anymore
Don't let her excite you, don't let her invite you
But crawl out of your flesh and land to the floor
Just keep your peace, keep your peace
I know her perfume, it lingers deep
Upon her chingam
While you sleep, trust your eyes
They're paralyzed, don't wage your own lives
Sheep as she keeps, don't bring devastation
Into your happy home
Don't let them offend you
Don't let them offend you
Don't let them unglue you anymore
Don't let them alarm you
Don't let words harm you
Don't disown all you adore
Just keep
Keep your peace
Don't let your mind get intertwined
This world's a lie
Make believe an old man's words
It's guaranteed that God above will tell you to leave
Don't negotiate, don't stick around
