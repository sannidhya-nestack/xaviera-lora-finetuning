I wear socks, you wear stockings
My fingers camp while yours is shocking
I wear pants, you slip on panties
You only take a little bit of what you fancy
I stuff my face, you sip your tea
I'm a modern man, you make fun of me
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop
I pull the snow while you are patting
You use your foundation while I use grouting
Don't even know what's good for me
Well, I know that it ain't you, Trudy
Oscar with viral, you use a fountain
Modern man, you keep on shouting
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba da-bow
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-bow
You're dressed in casual while I look unsightly
On flattering pyjamas against your cute nightie
If I just listened perhaps I'd understand
All these useless traits of a modern man
When I sweat
You just glow
I toss the ball while like a girl you throw
You go weak at the knees I use elbows
While the tears of the modern man I show
Say you could read every book, listen to news
But you'd still rather be in my shoes
Da da da da da da da da da da da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da-da, bow
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da-da, bow
Da, da, da, da, da ,da, da-da, bow
