What you doing in the middle of the road (bang, bang)
You a knucklehead and dumber than a toe (bang, bang)
Better get through your thick attitude (bang, bang)
Get a grip'cause I'm coming for you
Walk off this morning you was thinking of a crime
Well, you've been thinking about it for a long, long time
Well, wake up Jack
Rabbit better back up your queue
Bang bang
Someone stupid coming gunning for you
That's right
More stupid with the gun than you
More stupid with the gun than you
Bang bang
Put the gun on the floor
Bang bang
Everybody's headed out to the door
Bang bang
Bang bang
Good riddance you my next shot jerk
Bang bang rubber duckie from my Uncle Sam
Back to the slammin' where you came from man
All you wanted was a four foot dam
Bang bang now where are you Sam
Fifty percent on the dollar oh yeah
Now I wasn't that dumb like a dumb can do
now you're in the midst of someone dumber than you
Don't holla don't wail for your twenty-first chance
You the one who brought you to this stupid dance
You the sucker brought you to this mother-flippin' dance
Bang bang
Bang bang
