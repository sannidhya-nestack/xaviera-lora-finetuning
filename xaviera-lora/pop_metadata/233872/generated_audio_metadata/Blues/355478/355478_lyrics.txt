The flame calls me, draws me, moves my soul
What else in my world shines so brightly?
So if I dance like a moth'til the darkness comes
I'll dance like a moth'til the darkness comes
Black was my night until the flame appeared
Passion to die for, make the living sweet
And if I dance like a moth'til the darkness comes
Then I'll dance like a moth'til the darkness comes
Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
