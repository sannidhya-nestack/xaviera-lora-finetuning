If you ever change your mind
About leaving me behind
You better think twice
You better be nice
You better treat me
Like a man
Cause if you leave me
Baby believe me
I'll still be here
All I can
So baby don't leave me
Baby don't leave me
All alone
If you ever
Have that doubt
Let me hear it, just spit it out
Don't say goodbye
Before you say why
Don't say it's time
You need your space
Please don't hurt me
Don't you desert me
With this pain (da-da) still on my face (da-da)
So baby don't leave me (da-da)
Baby don't leave me (da-da) all alone (da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-DA! (Da!)'Cause remember I told you (Da! Da! Da! Da! Da! Da! Da! Da! Da! Da! Da! Da! Da! Da!
I so want to hold you and understand the way you feel
But you just won't let me, you'd rather et me
Yet here I am
Ready to kneel
Oh baby don't leave me
Baby don't leave me
On my own
If you ever make up your mind
And ive me for being so blind
I'll be there for you
I'll always take care of you
I'll share with you the good and the bad
Oh darling let's make up
No need to break out, Italy
Both very sad
So baby don't leave me
Baby don't leave me
All alone
