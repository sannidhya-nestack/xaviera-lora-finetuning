Train a comin'
Comin' down the track
And I'm runnin'
'Cause there's no way back
Going on a journey
To a place that's new
Leave the heartache
And escape these blues
I'm on my way
Far away
Yes I'm on my way
Far away
No looking back
It's all in my past
Train a coming
Heading down the line
No more women, no, no
I learned my lesson this time, yeah
And a locomotive, oh
Makes the sweetest sound, ow, ow, ow
A whistle blowin', choo choo
Southern bound
Yeah, I'm on my way
Far away
Yeah, yeah
Yes, I'm on my way
Far away
