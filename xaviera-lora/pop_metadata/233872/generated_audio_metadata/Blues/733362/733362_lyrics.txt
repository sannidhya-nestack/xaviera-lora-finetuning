Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's been a long time since she was about
I troubled water, put the flame out
She moved away, I didn't get no call
I don't think I miss that girl at all
Well that's life, mmm that's life, man that's life
She found me on Facebook, she wants to meet
I'm thinking'bout her, thinking'bout me
She said, "I'll PM you to make amends
And get my postcard to your sat-nav friend"
Well that's nice, oh that's nice
Man that's nice
Oh yeah
Well, a PM said I'm waiting naked as the day
Drop what you're doing and get here right away now
She a mile away, I don't got no car
It's late at night and so near and so far
But that's life, mmm, that's life
Man that's life
I'm facing the floor
I'm wondering what to do
I'd love to be there on the truck with you girl
Got this idea, a blinding light
et Facebook girl if you got Skype that's life
Oh man that's life
She said oh no I don't got no Skype
I really need you here tonight
Missed my chance should have worked out
Story of my life and what it's about yeah
Oh that's life
Oh man that's life
Nothing left
For you
For you
Oh baby, I got me a train
I'm out the door and I'm on my way
Mmm, I'm gonna be with you tonight girl
