Drive on through the night sky
Drive on through the rain
Touch tongue to my lips
But pound through my veins
And if I find the darkness
Before I find the light
I just might be
I just might see
Memphis by midnight
Memphis by midnight
Hold on while I am able
Hold out while I'm not
Nothing, nothing come between me
And now this love I got
And if I find the darkness
Before I find the light
I just might be
I just might see
Memphis by midnight (Memphis by midnight)
(Then I'll be home)
Memphis by midnight (Memphis by midnight)
(Between love and me tonight)
Memphis by midnight (Memphis by midnight)
(Then I'll be home)
Memphis by midnight
Take me home
And if I find the darkness
Before I find the light
I just might be
I just might see
Madface by midnight
Madface by midnight
Madface by midnight
Madface by midnight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
