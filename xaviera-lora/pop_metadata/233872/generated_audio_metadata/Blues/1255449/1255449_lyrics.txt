Down in the valley where the wildflowers grow
There's a little town where the rivers flow
Sunny days and starry nights
Country blues is a beautiful sight, country blues
Oh country blues, we got no worries, we got no shoes
We play the guitar under the moon, singin' the country blues tune
Momma's in the kitchen, daddy's by the door
Little birds singing outside our floor
Granny's on the porch, rocking in a chair
Feeling the wind blow through her hair
Country blues, oh country blues
We got no worries, we got no clues
We play the banjo under the sun
Singing the country blues until the day is done
So clap your hands, stomp your feet
Country blues cannot be beat
Every day's a song
Every night's a dance
That's the magic of the country blues trance
So clap your hands
Stomp your feet
Country blues cannot be beat
Every day's a song
Every night's a dance
That's the magic of the country blues trance
So clap your hands, stomp your feet
Country blues cannot be beat
Every day's a song, every night's a dance
That's the magic of the country blues trance
So clap your hands, stomp your feet
Country blues cannot be beat
Every day's a song, every night's a dance
That's the magic of the country blues trance
So clap your hands, stomp your feet
Country blues cannot be beat
Every day's a song, every night's a dance
That's the magic of the country blues
Trance, trance, trance
So clap your hands, stomp your feet
Country blues cannot be beat
