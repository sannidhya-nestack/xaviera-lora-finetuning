You took my money and blew it away
You stole my freedom
Then threw it back in my face
You took everything
Yes, I took all that
Your wages I've seen
Oh, kill my guitar
Now that wasn't nice
Down at the pawn shop, did you get a good price?
It's time to begin, so come and collect your wages I've seen
I know I should try my best to et
But time ain't no healer, the remedies will revenge
I got a feeling it won't be long
You'll come back when the morning is gone
Don't bring me excuses, don't tell me no lies
Accept the punishment, it's a night for a night
I'll say it again, just call my call-out
Your wages I'll see
Come on boy, take the punishment boy
I know I'll be strong when the day swings around
You'll watch me laughing as you're falling to the ground
Let's make a wager as you're fire-bitten
You'll be filled with remorse, regret
Don't bring those excuses, of course you were wrong
I don't need pity, I've found a way to get along
One day I will win, when you come and call it
You wait and you'll see
That's right
