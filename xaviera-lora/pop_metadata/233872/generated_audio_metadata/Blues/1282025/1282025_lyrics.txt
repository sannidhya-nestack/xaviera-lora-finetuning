You say my man's coming home
Won't let him march back in
Been out there drinking around
With his low class friends
My serotonin's low now
Running on empty
Feeling so dark, don't love me
Got those problems that bloom
I'm not here to be funny
Not trying to be cruel
Bristol, can you help me?
Eli knows what's true
Never let your heart guide
Feelings can deceive
Mind stays sharp and ready
Then you'll see what's real
My serotonin's low now
Running on empty
Gotta get myself together
Got those pros at work
'Cause my man makes me crazy
Losing all my cool
Bristol, can you save me?
Eli knows what I'm going through
