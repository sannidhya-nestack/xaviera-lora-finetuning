Well, my baby, she's a looker, she's one of a kind
She's got a way of cookin' with the bones and grindin'
All the bells and whistles, she's the queen of the land
Kissin' and a hug, but she's all you can stand
When it comes down to rockin', she's more than I can take
She's mean, mean, she's a love machine
Got the longest legs that you ever seen
Got no drag, yeah, she's built for speed
Crystal ball, yeah, she got it all
When it comes down to loving, she's more than I can tame
I said baby don't jump so hard (my baby jump)
Well baby don't jump so hard (my baby jump), baby don't jump so hard (my baby jump, yeah)
Baby don't jump so hard (she jumps so hard)
Well hold my back, baby don't jump so hard (my baby jump)
Now bring the bars
[Applause]
My strength is gone, I'ma tuck her down
Give me an hour just to work it out
She smiles at me, winks an eye
It's enough to make this grown man cry
When it comes to rockin', she's more than I can take
I said now baby don't jump so hard (my baby jump)
I said now baby don't jump so hard (My baby jump)
Baby don't jump so hard (my baby jump)
Baby don't jump so hard (she jump so hard)
You're breaking my back
Baby don't you jump so hard (my baby jump)
Baby don't jump so hard (my baby jumps)
Baby don't jump so hard (my baby jumps)
Baby don't jump so hard (my baby jumps)
Baby don't jump so hard (she jumps so hard)
Baby don't jump so hard (my baby jumps)
Baby don't jump so hard (my baby jumps)
Baby don't jump so hard
My baby don't jump so hard (my baby don't jump)
My baby don't jump so hard (she jump so hard)
Baby, you break my back
Baby don't jump so hard (my baby don't)
