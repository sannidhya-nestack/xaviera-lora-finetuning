I think my love might want too much
Could it be I lost the touch
Try so long but I'm set to fail
She said baby let your six straight where
I got a woman who is always true
Said if I'm down here's what you gotta do
She said run to the river
Run to the sea
Down to the stronghold of love with me
Baby, come on, I'm gonna set you free
Down earth and strong, hold the love with me, come on
I said that I'm too tired to go
Says if I don't then I will never know
Said that I got a hundred reasons to quit
Just to keep looking'til I finally fit
I don't know if I can do it this time
It's what you said that really blows my mind
So I said run to the river, run to the sea
Run to the stronghold of love with me
Baby come on, I'm gonna set you free
Down off the stronghold of love with me
She make me feel so fine
She bring it all the time to sleep
She said run to the river, run to the sea
Run to the strong, hold the love with me
Baby come on, I'm gonna set you free
Run to the strong, hold the love with me
Down to the river, down to the sea
Down to the strong, hold the love with me
