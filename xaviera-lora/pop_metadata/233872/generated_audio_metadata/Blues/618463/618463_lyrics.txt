There's a new day calling, I get out of bed
Leave all the heartache, all those words she said
Wipe the steam from the mirror as I wash my face
Then out the front door getting on the case
I'm stepping out
It's a new beginning, going all out
Gonna start believing, go play around
Positivity
No contemplating, that is not for me
Those days are gone, I'm a different man
It all makes sense, now I understand
No time for waiting, life won't get me down
I'm feeling good, yeah
I'm stepping out
I'm going downtown
I'm stepping out
Going downtown
There's a new temptation but it don't come cheap
I'm losing battle on a one way street
When I've lost all the money and the wells run dry
I'll still be standing on an all time high
I'm moving on, it's a new life plan
No looking back now I understand
No hesitating life won't get me down
I'm feeling good yeah
I'm stepping out
Going downtown
I'm stepping out
Going downtown
