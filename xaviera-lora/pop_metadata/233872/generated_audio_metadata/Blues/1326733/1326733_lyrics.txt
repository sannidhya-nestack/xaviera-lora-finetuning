While driving through the Lone Star
Stopped at a little bar
In a town they called Laredo
Saw the queen of the dance floor
Spinning like a revolving door
I witnessed a Texas tornado
She was a mesmerizing girl
Without a worry in the world
Putting on a powerful show
Her body kept my eyes busy
I started to get dizzy
From watching that Texas tornado
Then she spun right up to me
Innocent as can be
Said it was time for us to go
Next thing I knew she'd turn me every way but loose
I was captured by a Texas tornado
The years have passed by she's still by my side
I'll always remember Laredo
What a way to start when she stole my heart
That first night with my Texas tornado
I've got a lifetime story describing all the glory
From loving my Texas tornado
