You're the love
Cold mountain morning
And it's another day
Slowly dawning
Through a winter haze
I've been awake all night
With a good old friend
Trying to help him find his way back again
Bourbon bottles lying empty where it fell
Spilled out a secret I just couldn't tell
All that he talked about was you
And every moment of sweet loving
The two of you been through
All that he talked about was you
I couldn't bear to tell him
You never have been true
The longer that I leave it
The hotter it could be
To tell the man it was, was you and me
All that he talked about was you
And every moment of sweet loving
The two of you been through
All that he talked about was you
I couldn't bear to tell him
You never, never have been true
Cold mountain morning
It's another day
Slowly dawning
Through a winter haze
All that he talked about was you
And every moment of sweet loving
That true of you been true all that he talked about was you
I couldn't bear to tell him you never never have been true
Never have, never were, never will, never more
