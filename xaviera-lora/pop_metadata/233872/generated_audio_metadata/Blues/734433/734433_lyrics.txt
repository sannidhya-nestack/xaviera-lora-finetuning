I'm putting a stop to this downhill slide
If I sink any lower, I'll be buried alive
Had about enough, I'd be running'round all over town
No more sleepless nights alone
Got better things to do, places to go
I've run out of tears, I'm going in the crying town
There's a whole lot of world outside my door
I'm back on track, all aboard
Bon voyage, adios, goodbye
Gonna take a little cruise and leave you and the blues behind
My heart could sure use a change of scene
Anyway, you're not, it's fine with me
I'm sailing out tonight
Bon voyage adios, goodbye
I wrote out the "You're not welcome here" math
Had locked the door and packed my bags
I'll be anxious away before you know what's what
I won't be wishing you were there
I'll be having too much fun to care
Out of line, out of time
Baby, you're out of luck
I closed our account at the local bank
Going first class, I've got you to thank
Bon voyage
Adios, goodbye
Gonna take a little cruise and leave you and the blues behind
My heart can sure use a change of scene, anyway you're not
It's fine with me, I'm sailing out tonight
Bon voyage adios, goodbye
My heart could sure use a change of scene
And that way or not is fine with me
I'm sailing out tonight
Bon Voyage adios, goodbye
