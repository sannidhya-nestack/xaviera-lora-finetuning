I've taken the money
Moving fast
And I'm running
there's no way back
Going on a journey
To a place that's new, ah
I'll leave the heartache
And escape this blues, mmm
I'm on my way
Far away
Yes, I'm on my way
Far away
No looking back
It's all in the past
I've taken the money
Heading down the line
No more women, no, no
I learned my lesson this time
And the music's playing
Oh, makes the sweetest sound
Ow, ow, ow
I keep on moving
Southern bound, yeah
I'm on my way
Far away, yeah
Yes, I'm on my way
Far away
