I came in from being out'til half past two o'clock
Couldn't get past the front door'cause my baby changed the lock
She said that she was over me, she said that we were through
I guess I missed the signals I didn't catch
Then my friend gave me his guitar
Said there's only one thing to do
Pour my sorrows out in the twelve bar blues
So I'm starting on the corner down at Dudley's Cruzon Inn
Then I'm moving on to what I
Do a round with all my friends
Have some shots with this marine
At the Texas Rose Cafe
Now I made my way to Katie's
And Miss Newby's by the bay
I'm walking off my heartache
And wearing out my shoes
So far it's five bars later
But I still have the blues
Won't somebody help me
Somebody help me
Tell me what I'm doing
I've been working only twelve bars the way they told me to
But I ain't feeling any better and she's still gone
She's gone, oh gone
I hit the white horse, the longhorn, and Johnny's hideaway
Cowboy hats and tiki laps, it's been a long strange day
The Elks Club, the Moose Lodge, the VFW Hall
Then I struck out at the all night lanes when I missed last call
Settled for the Claremont, not a place I'd usually choose
But now it's twelve bars later and I still have the blues
Won't somebody help me (somebody help me)
Tell me what I'm doing wrong (what I'm doing wrong)
I've been working on these twelve bars the way they told me to
But I ain't feeling any better and she's still gone
Won't somebody help me (somebody help me)
Tell me what I'm doing wrong (what I'm doing wrong)
I've been working on these twelve bars the way they told me to
But I ain't feeling any better and she's still gone
I've been working on these twelve bars the way they told me to
But I ain't feeling any better and she's still gone
Say what my buddy gave me this dang guitar for anyway
