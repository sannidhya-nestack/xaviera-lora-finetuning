Don't go down to the water
Don't go down to the sea
Don't go down to the water baby
You better off here with me
Sometimes I just stop to wonder what fate's got in store for me
In the blink of an eye you know it's all gone by another fool in history
Looking in the mirror at my father's eyes
Still chase dreams every day
They'd flown the nest, I guess they knew best
Hope you're gonna stay here with me now, now, now
Don't go down to the water
Don't go down to the sea
Don't go down to the water baby
Now you better out here with me now now now
Open many door with my music baby
Had good life in the sun
Good friends all over the world
Don't matter if the money's gone
Sometimes I just have to wonder
What the fate's got in store for me
And I think of an eye, you know it's all gone by
You're just another fool in history
Don't go down to the water
Don't go down to the sea
Don't go down to the water baby
You better rock here with me
Don't go down to the water
Don't go down to the sea
Don't go down to the water baby
You better rock here with me
Baby please don't go to the sea
Don't go the water baby
You better off here with me now now
Don't go don't go baby
Don't go down to the sea yeah
Don't go down to the water such baby
You better off here with me
