Jimmy Jive came a-walkin' by
Said he's goin' over to get some moonshine
Knows a little joint over in Tennessee
It's the coolest place that he's ever seen
Blue Legging Joe is the guy to know
Owns a nip joint where you need to go
Mountain Dew with a taste so pure
This medicine is the only cure going down
Down, down, bootleg town
Going down, down, down
Bootleg town, going down
Market goods on the great hush-hush
Don't tell everybody where you get the stuff
Joseph is a man you don't run across
Connected to the family of the Dixie mob
They shoot you down for a dollar more
So once you've had your merchandise get out the door
Just one drink before you hit the road
You'll be back for another load
Going down, down
Down, bootleg town
Going down (going down)
Down (down)
Down, bootleg town
Going down
Down, down, down, bootleg town
Going down, down, down, bootleg town
Going down
Going down, down, down
Bootleg town
Going down
