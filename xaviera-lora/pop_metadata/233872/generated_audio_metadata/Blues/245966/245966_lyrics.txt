Cool cup cuties with tight black pants
Can't keep a rhythm but a show can dance
A job made'em crazy with just one glance
I love how they swing that thing
Dark-eyed darlings with a sexy smile
Won't go the distance but will walk a mile
No sense of fashion but I love that style
I love how they swing that thing
Bust a move, get in the groove, honey just take my lead
Create a mood, it's just an attitude and baby that's all you need
Blue eyes, blonde hair in a tight red dress
Hot but harmless as you would guess
One wrong move and your life's a mess
Oh I love how they swing that thing
Bust a move, get in the groove
A hundred just to take my lead
And create a mood, it's just an attitude
And baby, that's all you need
Blue-eyed, bonnet in a tight red dress
A hard-butt harmless as you would guess
But one wrong move and your life's a mess
Oh, I love how they swing that thing
I love how they swing that thing
Yeah, I love how they swing that thing
Love how they swing that thing
