I can't seem to move on and I can't tell you why
I relive our time while this time passes by
And I long for a place
Yeah, well, I can't be free
From those endless memories
That burn in me, yeah
A simple solution can always be found
The voice of reason can always be drowned
But what have you got when all you have gained is a
Empty bottle to numb the pain
And you don't give up easily
You always put up a fight
Well, well, you don't let go even after you're gone
You never call the night
Don't be so insistent, don't act so naive
You still don't see what you still owe to me
You just don't know when to leave
And love's nothing more than the reason to cry
And the side effects linger, linger on
And the price is way too high
And no one's immune and it's easy
It's never easy to walk away, whoa, yeah, I know that we're through and I still can't resign
The pieces are scattered, I don't know what's mine
It's over and done, and still I remain on the sinking ship
Drowning out on the sea of pain
And you don't give up easily, you always put up a fight
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You don't let go even after you're gone
You never call it a night
Don't be so insistent
Don't act so naive
You still don't see what you still are to me
You just don't know where to leave
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You just don't know where
And you just don't know, oh baby
When to leave, when to leave
Yeah, just don't know
You just don't know, you just don't know where to lead
Well, you just don't know, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, you don't know where to lead, baby
It's lingered on and on
Home and home and home, yeah, yeah, yeah
You don't know where to be
