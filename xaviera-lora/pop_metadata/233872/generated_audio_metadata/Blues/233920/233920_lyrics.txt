Maybe it's time to say goodbye
Over shadows of dreams (I know I said)
You'd never see me cry, but now I'm coming
A part of the seams needed you more than life itself
Oh but knitting don't make it true
And as I fold my dreams to store on a shelf
All I can think about is you
I am no stranger
Stranger to pain
We both got something
You got her and I, I got this air
Or this sad refrain and the pain
I wanted a lover, you needed a friend
I said that's what I'll be
Feelings undercover, hoping that you'd bend
Well I guess the joke's on me
Why do I crave
What never can be (the emptiness)
Oh, it tears me apart
Can anyone feel this violence I feel?
Oh, what was the heart?
I am no stranger
Stranger to pain
We both got something
All you got hurt, all I got was this sad refrain
Oh yeah
And the pain
Can anyone feel this void inside me? Oh, once it was a hole
I am no stranger, no, no, no, no, no, no
Stranger to pain, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah
We both got something, oh, you left me with so much pain
Oh baby
I am no stranger, oh
I am no stranger, no, no, no, no, stranger to pain
I don't wanna say goodbye
I said you'd never, never see me cry
No, no, no, no
I am no stranger
Stranger to pain
I am no stranger
