Morning came around a little too quick
And I ain't feeling right
It ain't as though I was sick
But I did not sleep again last night
Maybe three days since I closed my eyes
Runnin' out of things to do
Tried everything, Shawn, being hypnotized
And I can't stop thinkin'bout you, no, no, no
I can't, can't stop
Can't stop thinking'bout you
Oh, you're a piece of everything I do
I can't, can't stop, can't stop thinking
Oh, do you think about me?
Friends tell me time will heal the pain
I'm not sure that's true
Stand up at a chance of going insane before I get over you
You are the reason for all of my rhymes
Now I ain't got a clue
Sleep's out of season, I ain't worth a dime
And I can't stop thinking'bout you, no, no, no, no
I can't, can't stop, can't stop thinking'bout you
Oh, you're a piece of everything, everything I do
I can't
Can't stop, can't stop thinking, oh, do you think about me?
Oh no, no, no, no, I can't, can't stop
No I can't, no I can't, I can't, can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't can't stop
Yeah everything, everything I do I can't, can't stop
I can't stop loving you
I can't, can't stop
Oh no no no no no no no no no no no
Oh no no
I can't, can't stop
Oh no I can't stop
I can't, I can't
Oh I can't, I can't
Oh I can't, can't stop
