Boardman, Mr. Boardman, don't et about me
Boatman, Mr. Boatman, I'm here with my family
And the water keeps rising, helicopter man, don't see me
Boatman, Mr. Boatman, can you save us from the mighty Mississippi?
In the old days, the boatman took the Greek souls across the River Styx
But I don't wanna die
So won't you come get us quick
If the water keeps rising
We'll be in a terrible fix
So please Mr. Boatman
Don't leave us without a paddle up this creek
Lights, the city, they were all so beautiful
Orleans, the music, is it all washed away
Help me somebody, help me, I'm here
I don't wanna go down this hard
Drowning in my own backyard
Boatman, Mr. Boatman, don't et about me
Boatman, Mr. Boatman, I'm here with my family
And the water keeps rising, helicopter man, don't see me
Boatman, Mr. Boatman, can you save us from the mighty Mississippi
Boatman, Mr. Boatman, we've been here so long
It's hot and there's a bad smell
Can you save us from this watery hell?
I've lived here all this time
And my name was just my life
Survival is a victory when you're in this kind of peril
Boardman, Mr. Boardman
Don't et about me
Boatman, Mr. Boatman
I'm here with my family
And the water keeps rising
Helicopter man, don't see me
Boatman, Mr. Boatman
Can you save us from the mighty Mississippi?
Boatman, Mr. Boatman
Don't et about me
Boatman, Mr. Boatman
I'm here with my family
And the water keeps rising
Helicopter man, don't see me
Boatman, Mr. Boatman
Can you save us, can you save us
From Hurricane Katrina
Lake Pontchartrain, wow
And the mighty Mississippi
