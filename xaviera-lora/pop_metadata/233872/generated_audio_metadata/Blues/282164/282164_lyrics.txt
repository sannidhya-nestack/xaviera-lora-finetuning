Well, I woke up this morning
I felt heavy like a rock sinking down
Yes I woke up this morning
I felt so heavy just like a rock sinking down
I read the morning papers
No good news could be found
I got in my car
I drove around this lonely town
Saw businesses and buildings
Oh Lord, they was closing down
Them boarded up storefronts
Looked like faces with a frown
Yeah, I saw the people were crying
But they did not make a sound
Well, now the man on the corner
Was hugging the Bible and talking to himself
Yeah, he was telling Jesus how the bottle put his life on the shelf
He was just another case of those big city blues
Yeah, you know I got'em too
While I'm suffering from those big city blues again
When I
I used to feel young and strong
Now I just feel old and tired
Everybody, they're getting nowhere
They're just wild lives, screeching tires
Oh Lord, they're just moving fast
Suffering from those big city blues
Yeah, and you know I got'em too, oh, I got those big city blues again
You know I stopped at the red light
Or was it just in my mind?
Somebody have mercy on me people
You know I think it's critical this time
Big black buildings stare down at me
Concrete arms reach out
Oh lord they don't comfort me
They won't set me free
Yeah, what's a poor girl to do
When she's suffering from those big city blues again
What's a poor girl to do
When she's suffering from those big city blues
Yeah, those big, big city blues again, baby, oh yeah
Big city blues again
