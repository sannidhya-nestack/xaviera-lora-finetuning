Take me baby, take me where I wanna be
Take me baby, take me where I wanna be
If you can't take me, girl I guess I'm setting you free
When I first met you, you were drinking water and wine
When I first met you, you were drinkin' water and wine
Now you're drinkin' all my whiskey, stayin' out all of the time
When we step out, you're always actin' tired and bored
When we step out, you're always actin' tired and bored
Once I leave, you're dancing all over the floor
So take me baby, take me where I wanna be
Take me baby, take me where I wanna be
If you can't take me, girl, I guess I'm setting you free
See all our friends they look at me like I'm a fool
All our friends look at me like I'm a fool
If you keep this up find another kingdom to rule
So shake me baby, shake me like the fruit on a tree
Oh, shake me baby, shake me like the fruit on the tree
Yeah, but see, you can't shake me, girl, that's why I'm setting you free
