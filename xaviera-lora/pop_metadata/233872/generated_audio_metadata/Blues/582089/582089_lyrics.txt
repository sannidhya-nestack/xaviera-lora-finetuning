I smoke and I drink and I write all day
I rarely eat and I hardly shave
Don't believe in the law to put a pray
I pray for a real rainy day
And a brunetta with a side of champagne
Fine black clothes and a ticket to Spain
But I don't own those sweetheart things
I pawn them off for a guitar string
Yeah some would fix it so you'd understand
That you ain't no kind of man
Without money, a woman, and a plan
But I never cared for the trophies of the sane man
The guards drive this car out just right in the rear
And scream out directions into their ears
But they just laugh and pretend not to hear
When they get bought they refuse to steal
So the caravan just rolls along
With a pouting deity, me and a song
Ask at least turn on the headlights
He says god damn it man you sound like my wife
Yeah some would fix it so you'd understand
That you ain't no kinda man
Without money or a woman and a plan
But I never get by the trophies of a sane man
Some ask is the glass half empty or full
I say there was never a glass at all
They say what'd you do, did your dream get dry
I say I can't recall but it looks like I tried
They say you poets, you're all the same
I say about you, we feel the same
They farrow their brow and ask my name
I say I'm Mr. Azari but you can call me Jane
You ask them to fix it so you'd understand
But Jane ain't no kind of man
Without money, a woman and a plan
But I never cared for the trophies
No, I never cared for the trophies
No, I never cared for the trophies of a sane man
