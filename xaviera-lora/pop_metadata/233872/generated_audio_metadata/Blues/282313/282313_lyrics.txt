Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready to hear the blues?
Life is just a meat grinder
And everybody
Gets their guts torn out sometimes
Life is just a meat grinder
And everybody
Gets their guts torn out sometime
Rich man, poor man
The blues will be there to hold your hand
Now Evett, Evett, the Queen of England
Well, she's got the blues
First there was the big divorce
Oh, the disgrace, now the tragedy
Yeah, the family name, it's all going down in flames
She's sitting up there in Windsor
She's drinking tea and eating crumpets
Oh, but the queen, she feels the pain
Life is just a meat grinder
And everybody
Gets their guts torn out sometime
Yes, but when you're living way too close
Way too close to the killing floor
Oh, the blues
Yes, they mean a whole lot more
You ain't sitting out there in Windsor
You ain't drinking tea and eating crumpets
You're just trying to stay alive
Pay your rent, pay medical insurance
Sometimes it's too much jive
Life is just a meat grinder
And everybody
Yeah, everybody gets their guts torn out sometime
And you can go to church on Sunday
You can get down on your knees
You can pray to the sweet baby Jesus
But in the end you will come to believe
Life is just a meat grinder
And everybody, everybody, everybody gets their guts torn out sometime
Rich man, poor man
Someday the blues will walk in your front door and take it by the hand
Life is just a meat grinder
