Tragedy throughout the world today
And tragedy isn't how it ought to be, no
I can't understand
This pain I see
I can't reconcile
This third degree
We're better than this
You and me
Oh, tragedy throughout the world today
And tragedy is now it ought to be
Let's take a stand
For our fellow man
And fix these things
Create a band
On all that's wrong
Let's use our strength to better man
Let's use our strength to bear to me
A tragedy
I won't let you in with me
A tragedy
Come to an end you'll see
Watch and you'll see
I want you to join in with me
I want you to join in with me, yeah
Let's create how it should be
With all our love we'll set, set us free
Yeah, these human ghosts comfort me
