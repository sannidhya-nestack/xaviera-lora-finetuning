How long must I wait?
How long must I anticipate?
How long'til my ship comes in?
How long, how long will I never win?
Some people pray for Jesus, some people pray for rain
Some people pray night and day for almost anything
I pray my sweet loving baby will come home again
And I won't have to be here all alone
Do you remember, baby, when we first met
How much in love we were and how good it all felt?
Nobody loves you and knows you better than me
In my loving arms, that's where you ought to be
How long must I wait?
How long must I anticipate?
How long till my ship comes in?
How long, how long will I never win?
Now I'm sitting here all on my own
Hurting, oh baby, right down to the bone
Why did we fight so badly on that night back then?
Can't we pick up the pieces and make it alright again?
Each day I check the mailbox looking for a letter
Hoping it'll say we're getting back together
Are you never gonna call me on my telephone
Oh baby, baby, I really need you to come back home
Hollow (Hollow)
Must I wait? How long must I anticipate? How long till my ship comes in?
How long, how long will I never win? How long?
Must I wait? How long must I anticipate?
How long'til my ship comes in?
How long will I never win? Oh, I wanna win
