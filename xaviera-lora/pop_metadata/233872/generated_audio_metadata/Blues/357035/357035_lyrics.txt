I'll have it with you, drinking girl, you're drinking on time
This time you push me to the edge, this time you cross the line, I'm leaving you, honey
Gonna pack my bags tonight, uh-huh
I'm a rip-off history, you can call me Don tonight
I'm leaving in the morning, I'll be quiet as a mouse
You can have the cat, the cattle, I can even have the house, I'm leaving you, honey
Gonna pack my bags tonight, uh-huh
I'm a rip-off history, you can call me golden knife
So I'm goin' to the coffee office, I ain't stayin'
You change your rules and suit yourself, but this time I ain't playin'
I'm leavin' now, honey
Gonna pack my bags tonight, uh-huh
I'm a rip-off history, you can call me golden knife
Allllllllllllllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllllllllllll
bad idea.
I have nothing left to do, I got nothing left to say
Except that I don't love you girl, so just get out of my way
I'm leaving you honey, gonna pack my bags tonight, uh huh
I'm a rip off history, you can carry me home tonight
I'm dust, I'm smoke, you can carry me home tonight
'Cause I'm a rip-off history, you can call me gone, that's right
