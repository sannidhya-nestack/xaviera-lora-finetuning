I can't imagine loving a girl like you
I can't imagine winning an Oscar too
I can't imagine going to the moon
I can't imagine seeing it snow in June
I can't imagine, no no no
I can't imagine, oh God no
I can't imagine
I can't imagine
I can't imagine living one hundred years
I can't imagine never crying tears
I can't imagine having peace on earth
I can't imagine watching a baby's birth
I can't imagine
No, no, no, I can't imagine
Oh God, no, I can't imagine
I can't imagine
I can't imagine losing the one you love
I can't imagine meeting the man above
I can't imagine driving a car like that
I can't imagine playing a Fender Strat
I can't imagine, no, no, no, I can't imagine
Oh God, no, I can't imagine
I can't imagine
I can't imagine being that millionaire
I can't imagine flying through the air
I can't imagine living with all that fame
I can't imagine knowing I won the game
I can't imagine, no, no, no, I can't imagine
Oh God, no, I can't imagine
Seeing that, I can't imagine
Doing that, I can't imagine
No no no, I can't imagine
Oh God no, I can't imagine
I can't imagine
What could imagine?
