I've been gone too long
Gone too long from you
I've been gone too long
Gone too long from you
Well, my heart was aching, now it's broken too
Well, I left that town, left one rainy day
Well, I left that town, left one rainy day
Had to leave you, baby, had to find my way
Leave that town, leave that
Well the days drank on nights are lonesome too
Yes the days drank on nights are lonesome too
And I will wait time
Will I ever find you?
I've been gone too long
Gone too long from you
Yes I've been gone too long
Gone too long from you
Well, my heart was aching
Now it's broken too
I'm gone too long
My heart was aching, I was broken too
