I float on my back heavy in water nowhere near the anchor of land
Too many a life no matter and the grey clouds loom
As the water starts to churn
I'm tired of these storm filled days
Tired of living in a drug filled haze
I'm tired of picking up the pieces of me
As I float in a sea of despair
What do I do to get one good day
How do I stop chasing the dragon
How did I ever lose my way
Picking up the pieces in my sea of despair
Day and night, drugs and drink
Shattering myself over and over again
No reality, I'm way past the brink
The grey clouds go black
And the waves wash over me
Here's hoping for a better day
I'm in need of a sheltered bay
I gotta keep picking pieces of me as I start to sink
In my sea of despair
What do I do to get one good day
How do I stop chasing the dragon
How did I ever lose my way
As I sink into a sea of despair
I went to church once, a clinic for sinners
But there was no help,'cause I ain't a winner
The place seemed to be just a museum for saints
The darkness surrounds me as the waves batter me under the sea
Oh, it's a storm of days
Through the storm of days
I hope I finally found my better day
Wherever I'm going I hope to stay
I finally found the pieces of me
I finally let go of the storm of bad days
Hope I finally found my better day
Wherever I'm going I hope to stay
I finally found the pieces of me
Finally free of the storm, storm of bad days
Safe from the storm of bad days
Yeah, the storm of bad days
