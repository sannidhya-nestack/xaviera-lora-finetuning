Where is my baby, it's a quarter to nine
Waited all evening, wasting my time
Oh I'm gonna get him back Lord, I'm gonna try
But I'm just no good at being bad
I'm so mad at myself that I can't stay mad
I drop to my knees and I hold up my hands
Prayin' Lord, won't you help me to be bad
This ain't the first time, won't be the last
He's a sorry son of a gun
But I'm still his last
I'll stay by his side
No matter what he do
And now it's a quarter till two
And I'm just no good at being bad
When he walks through the door
I et what I planned
I know I should leave him, but here I am
I'm just no good at being bad
I hear him talking, don't care what he says
I said put away your excuses boy, come on back to bed
I don't need your story, so love me instead
Love me instead
he's just so good at being bad (just so good)
He gives me good lovin'
The best that I've had
Someday I might leave him
But right now I need him
And I'm just no good at being bad
