Been around for in the water, said
Where I live now, well, there's just one catch
There ain't no port, I land low, so
Sail without a river, well, there's no doubt it's a whale, I said yeah
Yeah, you know it's true
Sail without a river, blues
Get me Memphis in the days of old
Send me up to London when it ain't too cold
No matter if it's big or what it's called
If it's got a river then I'll call it home
Well I said yeah, yeah you know it's true
The sea without a river blues
Said without a river it's such a sin
Once there was a river but they filled it in
And now I'm thinking to go somewhere
Sometimes I wonder what the missus would say
Well I said yeah, yeah you know it's true
A city without a river blues
Well I said yeah, yeah, you know it's true
A city without a river blues
I said yeah, yeah, you know it's true
A city without a river blues
A city without a river blues
A city without a river blues
A city without a river blues
