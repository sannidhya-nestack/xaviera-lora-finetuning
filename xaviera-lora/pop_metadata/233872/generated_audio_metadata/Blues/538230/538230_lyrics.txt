Do or don't, there is no try
Do or don't, don't ask me why
Just say you love me, that you always will
Don't say you'll try, to love me still
I should have seen it coming by and by
I should have seen the warning in your eyes
And I still can't believe it though I know it's true
Baby I'm right here and there is no you
Well I should have tried to love you
You say to me
Love something you do or you don't
But I tried so hard to tell you
And tell you that I will
Give you all the love you want
Do or don't
That's right
Show'em what you got now
You do or you don't baby
Do or don't
There is no time
Just do or don't
Don't ask me why
Just say that you love me
And that you always will
Don't say you'll try
To love me still
Just say you love me
And that you always will
