It's getting old chasing genie around
It's getting old, chasing Jeannie around
The bartender tells me she's confused right now
As she climbs the pole and she circles on down
And one of these days I'm gonna take that girl by the hand
And tell her exactly how I feel like this
I will love and shelter you
And when you hurt, I will heal with a kiss
But until then, I'll have to say it again
It's getting old chasing genie around
It's getting old, chasing genie around town
Jeannie tells me she's happy to see me tonight
Jeannie says, "Sweetie, I know what you like"
As I reach into my pocket and pull out another bill
She reaches into my heart and pulls out my pride
And then she walks away without looking back
I sit and wonder what I lack
I wonder why she wears black
Mmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmm
It's getting old
It's getting old
It's getting old
It's getting old
