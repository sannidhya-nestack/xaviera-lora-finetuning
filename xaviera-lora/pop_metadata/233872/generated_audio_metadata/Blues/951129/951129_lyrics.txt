New York, home to the neon streets
Caught in your spell, blinded by all I see
You've got me now, you've got me right now
Move on, let's take in this magic show
A foot on the gas, speed up and lose control
Just spin me round, I'm spinning all around
New York City lights
They gonna shine tonight
New York City lights
I can feel the heat of the city beat
Oh, New York City lights
They're gonna shine tonight, oh
New York City lights
I can feel the beat of the city beat
Headstrong
Hooked on your nighttime groove
Loving that sound
The traffic creates the mood
You got me now
The rhythm of the crowd
New York City lights
They gonna shine tonight
New York City Lights
I can feel the heat of the city, yeah
Now you see the light
Now you see the light
