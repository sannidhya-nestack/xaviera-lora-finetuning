Now there's a thin line between'em, uh
The things you shouldn't, shouldn't do, yeah
What I did and I didn't
Now there's a thin line between the two
You got a blue sky smile, lady
But there's a black cloud following you, yeah
Now there's a thin line between'em, huh
There's this world between me and you
There's a real thin line between fast and slow
Between green and blue between what you say what you do
Between young and old between cool and cold
Between the truth and the lies that you know you told
Yeah there's a thin line between armor
A mighty thin line you see, yeah
Now there's a thin line between'em
But there's a world between you and me
That there's a real thin line between is and isn't
Have and have not between know and a little
Talk and a lot between will and won't between couldn't and could
Between the winner that you shouldn't and the ones that you should
Between rich and poor between good and bad
Between light and dark and happy and sad
Between beginning and end and lust and love
Between the five
Down below and light up above
Yeah there's a thin line between'em
A mighty thin line you see yeah
Now there's a thin line between'em
But there's one world between you and me
Said there's a thin line between'em
But there's a real thin line you see yeah
Now there's a thin line between'em
There's a world between you and me
There's a world between you and me
I said a world between you and me
Finline, Finline, Finline, Finline
Has a thin line, a thin line, a thin line
Has a thin line, a thin line, a thin line, a thin line
Real thin wine
Half a thin wine
Real thin wine
