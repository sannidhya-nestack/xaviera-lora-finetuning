I believe some old hell hell
Found my black cat bone
I believe some old hellhound
Found my black cat bone
Cause the stars don't look right
And the moon is looking wrong
I can hear that old hellhound
He's just scratching at my door
I can hear that old hellhound
He's just scratching at my back door
If that hound ever gets in
I won't be hanging around no more
No more
Well the rain started falling
And the wind began to howl
Yeah the rain started falling down
And the wind began to howl
Tell everybody around here
We got a hellhound on the prowl, on the prowl
I believe some old hellhound
Dug up my black cat bone
I believe some old hellhound
Scratched up my black cat bone
Cause the stars don't look right
And the moon is looking wrong
Yes it is
