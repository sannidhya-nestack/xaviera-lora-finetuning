I've been down to the crossroads where the shadows lie in wait
Then a thousand old regrets wear it in the mask of fate
The road ahead is windy, the signs are hard to see
But I keep moving forward, chasing what's left of me
Oh, the night is calling so fleet
The horizons are lost in haze
With each step I'm drifting further, an elaborate of days
A guitar in my hand, singing notes of sweet despair
Trying to find redemption in the cool midnight
I hear the distant rumble of a storm that's rolling near
Thunder speaks in riddles as lightning cracks my fear
The rain falls on these memories like rivers to the sea
Washing away the fragments of who I thought I'd be
Oh, the night is cold and suffering
The horizons are lost in things
You keep stare if I'm drifting further
In a labyrinth of days
A guitar in my head
Singing notes of sweet despair
Trying to find redemption
In the cold midnight
I've walked this line so many times where shadows and dreams collide
Through valleys full of echoes and mountains of foolish pride
But I'll keep on strumming with fire in my soul
Unraveling the mysteries that never let me go
Faces pass like raindrops under the neon glow
In a town that's always sleepin' with secrets it won't show
I sing beneath the street lights, a tale of loss and gain
With every chord I play, I ease a little pain
Oh, the night is calling softly
The horizons are lost in haze
With each step I'm drifting further
In a labyrinth of days
A guitar in my head
Singing notes of sweet despair
Trying to find redemption
In the cool midnight air
