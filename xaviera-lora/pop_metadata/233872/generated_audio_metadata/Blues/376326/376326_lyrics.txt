For you I tried only to find
Sometimes I wasn't trying at all
Feeling sorry for myself being too much alone
Inside of these heart broken blues
In vain I tried to reach higher ground
Held back by my habits it's true
God sends me where He will and it's there that I find
I really only need you
These heart broken blues cry for the time without you
And beg for a moment so true
That would tell of my love amidst this big sea of trouble
My heart is empty if not for my love of you
Could it possibly be that I'm just too far out
Than to find another way to your heart
It would have been much more easy just to dream or realize
That you might have needed me too
So I want this guitar that I play just to sing
This piece of wood, this old friend of mine
To sing that so others might find themselves spared
Of all of these heartbroken blues
These heartbroken blues cry for the time without you
And beg for a moment so true
The woodchell of my love makes this big sea of trouble
My heart is empty if not for my love again
I met me a woman and I wanted to love her
My heart cried out to be next to hers
Her smile and her laughter gave me some hope
To overcome and not lose her forever
So drink up and toast as I would do you
And remember never give up your dreams
Or you'll find yourself lonesome and lost against time
Reliving these heartbroken blues
These heartbroken blues cry for the time without you
And beg for a moment so true
It would tell of my love, mid-sysphexia trouble
My heart is empty if not
For my love of you
For my love of you
For my love of you
