Sun is going down
Friends at the door
Get it together
Hop in my old Ford
Let's go girl
Pedal to the metal hit the road
Neon colors light up my shades
Hole in my pocket, yeah gonna blow some paint
Oh work no play, got to get away and shake those night blues
Shake, shake, shake, shake those night blues (shake, shake, shake, shake it)
Shake, shake, shake, shake those night blues, (shake, shake, shake, shake it)
Shake, shake, shake, shake those night blues (shake, shake, shake, shake it)
Shake, shake, shake, shake those night blues (shake, shake, shake, shake it)
Shake'em baby, it's long overdue
Shake those night blues
Stuck inside
Don't know what to do
Slide on that dress
Slip on those shoes
Turn up the music
And shake away, shake away those night blues
Shake, shake, shake, shake those night blues
Shake, shake, shake, shake those night blues
Shake, shake, shake those night blues
Shake, shake, shake, shake those night blues
Shakin' baby, it's long overdue
Shake those night blues
Break it down to half time
Lay some brass on me sunshine
Take it up, hear the bassline
Keys slide down like fine wine
Heart blows away
What do you say
We shake those night blues
Shake shake shake shake those night blues
Shake, shake, shake, shake those night blues
Shake, shake, shake, shake those night blues
Shake, shake, shake, shake those night blues
Shake'em baby, it's long overdue
Shake those night blues
