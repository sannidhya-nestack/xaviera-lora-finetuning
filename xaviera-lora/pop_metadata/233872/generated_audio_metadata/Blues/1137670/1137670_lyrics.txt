Said, "Listen to me, baby, can't you see? I'm working my ass off in this factory
It's alright for you and your satin lace
You can get by with your pretty face, but don't you cry for me"
Said, "Don't you lie to me"
Just tell me where you've been
Don't you lie to me
I've seen you at the barn at the drive-in too
Creeping in a minute holding on to your shoes
If you've been seeing someone while I'm working so hard
You might want to bury it in your own backyard
Don't you cry for me
Said don't you lie to me
Just tell me where you've been
Don't you lie to me
Don't lie baby, don't you lie
Folks say that you're running round with other guys
Tell me pretty baby that it's just all lies
I want you for my very own night with someone else
Put my mind at ease and tell me true to yourself
Don't you cry for me
Don't lie to me
Tell me where you've been
And don't you lie to me
Say don't you lie to me
Don't lie to me
Don't you lie to me now
Don't lie to me
Just tell me when
