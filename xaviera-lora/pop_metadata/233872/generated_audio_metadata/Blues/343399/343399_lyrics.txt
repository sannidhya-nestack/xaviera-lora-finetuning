How I love my, my sweet Ivory
How I love my, my sweet Ivory
She's everything a good girl ought to be
Don't get angry
No matter what I bring
She don't get angry
No matter what I bring
And she's so nice
When she talks she sings
She say, "Ooooh Daddy"
She say, "Oooh, daddy"
She say, "Oooh, daddy"
Now she don't nag
And she don't complain
She don't nag
And she don't complain
But how she holler when I ride her like a train
She say, "Ooo, ooo"
She say, "Ooo, ooo"
She said, "Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo"
When I get home she's always there for me
When I get home she's always there for me
When I'm down she's my misery
And you know when it's cold she gets kinda stiff
When it's cold, she gets kinda stiff
But when it's hot, she makes my fingers drip
I say, "Oooh, Mama"
I say, "Oooh"
And when I touch her she begins to sing
When I play her, she begins to sing
She's my passion, my joy, sweet ivory's my everything
