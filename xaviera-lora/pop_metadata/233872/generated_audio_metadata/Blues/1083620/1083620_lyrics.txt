Back to the beginning
Back to the start
Where two souls were dreaming
Sharing a single heart
Brick by brick we build it
Word by word we tear it down
Running round in circles
Brings us back around
Back to the morning
Tangled in each other's arms
Hanging on each moment
Like tomorrow never comes
Brick by brick we build it
Word by word we tear it down
Running round in circles brings us back around
Back to iveness, finding our way again
Another page turning
Another shifting of the wind
Brick by brick we build it
Word by word we tear it down
Running round in circles
Brings us back around
Running round in circles
Running round in circles
Running round in circles
Brings us back around
