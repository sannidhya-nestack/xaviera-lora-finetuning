Fernando, you were such a strong bull
But life will take its toll
Even on one so proud and free
You would not give in and try to run
But got no sympathy from the Federali's guns
Crossing the border a desperado
Searching for a better life
For yourself and your Marie
C'est la vie, the French would say
Hasta la vista, my compadre
When the federales came down I froze to the ground
But like a bird you fled over rock and stream
I saw the smoke heard a dying scream
There will be no trial death is final
And your mamacita back in Mexico
Will never know where they laid you low
The beautiful Marie crosses herself in praise
In her heart you will always stay
Her beloved forevermore
Fernando, you were such a strong bull
But life will take its toll
Even on one so proud and free
If only your soul could speak to me
Mañana would not be so cold and lonely
Fernando, Fernando
Goodbye my friend, Fernando
