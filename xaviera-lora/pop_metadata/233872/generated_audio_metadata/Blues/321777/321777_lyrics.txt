I've got to ride on down the highway
Got to drive away these blues
I've got to ride on down the highway
I've got to drive away these blues
Ever since you've done me wrong
I've got no more use for you
You tell me that you're sorry
You're gonna make it up to me
Girl you tell me you're sorry
You're gonna make it up to me
After all the lies you've been telling
You can't say nothing I believe
All I got is this old steel horse and a saddle bag or two
All I got is this old steel horse and a saddle bag or two
I'm leaving here tomorrow, got to drive away these blues
I got to ride on down the highway
I got to drive away these blues
I got to ride on down the highway
Got to ride away these blues
Ever since you've done me wrong
I got no more use for you baby
