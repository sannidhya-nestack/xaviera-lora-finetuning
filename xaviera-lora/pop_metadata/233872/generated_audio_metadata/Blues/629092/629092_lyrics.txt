Woke up this morning
My head was aching
So empty inside
Whiskey by my side
Under the cover
I'll lie there for you
Wanted to go
While I'm there for you
I keep on rolling
Keep on iving
I turn a blind eye
To all your many lies
All of the guns
Are ready for you
All of the guns
Are ready for you
One of the, one of the, one of the guns
One of the, one of the, one of the guns
One of the guns
