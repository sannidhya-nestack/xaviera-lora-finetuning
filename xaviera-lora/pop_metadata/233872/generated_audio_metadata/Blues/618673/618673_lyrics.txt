Ace in my pocket
King up my sleeve
I don't intend on losing
On winning streak
Ace in my pocket
Part of the plan
I don't intend on playing
Playing the losing hand
Playing the losing hand
It's so sweet
This winning streak
Mm-hmm
Can't beat the hustle, thrill of the ride
The odds stacked in my favour, luck is on my side
Feeling the mojo, total command
Tonight I won't be playing, playing the losing hand
Playing the losing hand
It's so sweet
This winning streak
