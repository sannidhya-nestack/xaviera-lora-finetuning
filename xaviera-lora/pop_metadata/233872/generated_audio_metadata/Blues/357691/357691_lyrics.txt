Listen to me baby
I hope you'll understand
That when it comes to loving
You need a sensitive man
A sensitive man
A man that just don't come and go
You deserve so much more
You need a sensitive man
Sensitive man
Oh my you look so pretty
Dressed in your mink coat
Now here comes your chauffeur
It's almost time to go
And find a sensitive man
A sensitive man
A man that buys you pearls and rings
A man loves it on his knees
You need a sensitive man
A sensitive man
Sensitive man, sensitive man
You need a sensitive man, honey
Sensitive man, sensitive man
You need a sensitive man, honey
