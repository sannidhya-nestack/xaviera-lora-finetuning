There's a space in the corner
It's where you stood before you left
There's a pain in this cold cold heart
I'm regretting those words unsaid
Outside lights cast a shadow
Crumpled sheets on the bed
There's no sense in this mixed up world
When we're leaving those words unsaid
I try to leave but I can't let go
Still regretting those words unsaid
I'm down on my knees
With my prayers I keep preaching out loud
I'm begging you please
But I can't lift myself off the ground
There's a space in the corner
So where you stood before you left
There's a pain in this cold cold heart
I'm regretting those words I said
There's a pain in this cold cold heart
I'm regretting those words I said
I'm down on my knees
With my prayers I keep preaching out loud
I'm begging you please
But I can't lift myself off the ground
There's a space in the corner
So where you stood before you left
There's no sense in this mixed up world
When we're leaving those words unsaid
I try to leave but I can't let go
Still regretting those words unsaid
Words unsaid
Words unsaid
