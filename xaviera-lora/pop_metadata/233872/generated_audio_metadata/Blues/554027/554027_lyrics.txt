I wake up in the morning light and I see something's in the shadows and it calls for me
I'm squintin' in the daylight and it's not very clear
But one thing I know for sure, she's still here
I wake up in the morning light
What have I done
It was a real good idea at the time
Yeah she's the one
Now I'm searching for my dignity
Even my dog looks at me with disbelief
One of my biggest fears
She's still here
I wake up in the morning light
She's been hanging around my house all night
Putting on my robe and wearing my slippers
Feeding my dog and stroking its whiskers
Hairs on top and looking funky
Eating my food and drinking my coffee
What have I done? She's still here
I wake up in the morning light
And I see
Something lurking in the shadows
And it calls to me
I'm squinting in the daylight
And it's coming very clear
And there's one thing I know for sure
She's still here
She's still here
She's still here
My biggest fear
She's still here
Oh Lord
Seemed like a real good idea, felt nice
She's still here
She's still here
Oh, she's still here (still here)
