Baby, you scream and you shout
All that you did was try to put me down
Baby, I wanted to see
I'm going away so I can find relief
Taking a ride to an abandoned street
Oh, yeah
Baby, I don't have a thing
Standing so tall, I could do anything, baby
So sick of that breed
It's been me around, it sucked the life from me
But now I've escaped to independent street
All right, yeah
All right
And I found us three
And no doubt
Oh baby
I want you to know
That everything's good since I've been on my own, baby
There's no one to lack to me
And I'm going back to all the misery
Of living my life all independence free
Oh yeah
In the pen-del-sweet
All right
Yeah, I'll take a ride to where the pen-del-sweet
