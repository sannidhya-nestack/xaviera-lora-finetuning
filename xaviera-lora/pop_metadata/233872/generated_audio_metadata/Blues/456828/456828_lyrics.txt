Going downtown, money all in my hand
I don't tell nobody, they just won't understand
There's a girl I'm along to see
I give her money, she makes love to me
I thank God for Louis
She's big on top
She's got that nice slim waist
She makes love with a smile on her face
When I got nobody in this whole wide world
If I got money then she's my girl
I thank God for Louis
When I got nobody in this whole wide world
If I got money then she's my girl
I thank God for Louis
She don't ask questions, I don't tell her no lies
When my time is up she even waves bye bye
She knows that I'll be back again
When I got money but until then
I thank God for Louis
I thank God for Louis
I give her a hug, a squeeze
I thank God for Louis
Now it's nothing to do with me that song, Richie wrote that. Straight, I don't even know the girl, never met her. Nothing to do with me at all, I tell you. Straight.
