Everybody wants a little piece of you
To keep you from doing the things you wanna do
After a while you just wanna hide
You never get to do what you're feeling inside
My advice, don't listen to what people say
You do what you want and do it your own way
The gas bill, the light bill, the cable bill too
All the credit, the credit that is due
Then there's the car to put on the road
Insurance will cost you a heavy, heavy load
It's hard to get by without the things you need
But don't sell out for your own greed
Do it, do it, do it your own way
Do it, do it, do it your own way
Do it, do it, do it your own ways
Do it, do it, do it
Companies call you on the telephone
All through dinner they won't leave you alone
You ask them to call back in a day or two
But they keep on talking they don't care about you
Remember sometimes to draw a line in the sand
There's more to life than a 401k plan
Do it, do it, do it your own way
Do it, do it, do it your own way
Do it, do it, do it your own way
Do it, do it, do it your own way
