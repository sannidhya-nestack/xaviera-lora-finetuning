Tragedy throughout the world today
Tell me this ain't the way it's gotta be
Tragedy
Don't understand this pain I see
What better than this you and me
Let's join together we can march as one
Walk across this earth get that job done
Let's use our strength to win this fight
Take a stand until we make all things go right
Let's show the world how things should be
Now follow your heart and let it set you free
Tragedy, you ain't gonna win
This is our world, this is our people
Let the healing begin
Let's join together, we can march as one
Walk across this earth until our job is done
Let's use our strength to win this fight
Here and now
Take a stand until we make things right
Let's show the world how things should be
Now follow your heart and it shall set you free
This is our world
This is our people
Now let's
The healing begin
