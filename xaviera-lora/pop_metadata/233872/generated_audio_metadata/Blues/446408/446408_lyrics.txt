I don't trust you, you don't trust me
Ain't nothing in this life that comes free
I ain't no kitty cat or so furry pet
You gotta give sometimes before you get
Give to get
No regrets
Up the bed
You gotta give to get
You gotta give to get
No regrets, you gotta give to get
Courtesy, respect, cost a little pride
We can't go on when we're tangled up in lies
From the smallest favor to junk for free
You reap what you sow when you plant your seed
Give to get
No regrets up the back
You gotta give to get
A gift again
No regrets you gotta give to get
So take a dance with the devil's daughter
Don't be afraid to test the water
What you fear is your only slaughter
When you're afraid hell gets hotter
Give to get
No regrets up the back
You gotta give to get
Give to get
No regrets
You gotta give to give
You gotta give to get
You gotta give to get
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ah
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-yeah
Give to give
You gotta give to give
Give to give
Come on give to give
