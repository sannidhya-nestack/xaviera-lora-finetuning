I only slept, I didn't fall
She dialed my number but I never took the call
I read her mind and time and saw the writing on the wall
I only slept
I didn't fall, I might have been tempted, but I didn't sin
I put my foot in the pool but didn't jump in
I admit I sipped the tonic but I didn't taste the gin
I might have been tempted, but I didn't sin
Babe, I hope you understand when she offered her hand
I took a look
But shook it off, then honey I ran
I made a beeline home to where I know I belong
I left right before I did wrong
I might have tripped, I might have stalled
But I bet my lip got a grip and called a halt
I nipped it in the bud and nothing blossomed at all
I only slept, I didn't fall
Well babe I hope you understand when she offered her hand
I took a look but shook it off then honey I ran
Made a beeline home to where I know I belong
I left right before I did wrong
I only slept, I didn't fall
She dialed my number but never took the call
I read her mind in time and saw the writing on the wall
I only slipped, I didn't fall
I nipped it in the bud and nothing blossomed at all
I only slipped, I didn't fall
