I used to be a ruler, baby, yeah, I used to be a wheel
That waited in line for hours, honey, just for the chance to kneel
Ooh, what the hell did I do?
Payin' for a pie-slide to the loo
I used to be a lion, honey, yeah, I used to be the king
All the ladies would start crying, baby, every time I'd sing
Ooh, what the hell did I do?
Paying for past life to bloom
Paying for past life to bloom
Well, I must have done something many lifetimes ago
Because I really can't remember
But you act like I should know
I used to be a cowboy baby yeah I stole a piece of land
Now an Indian has all my money and I got a handle in my hand
Oh what the hell am I gonna do
Waiting for a pass line to the loom
Waiting for a pass line to the loom
Leaning for a past life to loo
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do
