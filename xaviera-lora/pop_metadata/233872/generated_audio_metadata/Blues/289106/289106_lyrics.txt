Once I was depressed and as blue as I could be
Then I saw a movie that starred Hillary
The clouds all parted and the sun did shine
I wish that million dollar baby were mine
I'm in love with Hillary Swank
I'm in love with Hillary Swank
I'm in love with Hillary Swank
But she don't even know my name
Went sixty minutes, had her on for an interview
I fell in love, what else could I do?
Then I saw her photos in a men's magazine
Now she is the star of all of my dreams
I'm in love with Hillary Swank
I'm in love with Hillary Swank
I'm in love with Hillary Swank
But she don't even know my name
Hillary, sweet Hillary, Miss Hillary Swank
She's the lady that I'd like to thank
If God was a woman in this beautiful world
She would surely be just like that girl
I'm in love with Hillary Swank
I'm in love with Hillary Swank
I'm in love with Hillary Swank
But she don't even know my name
Yes, I'm in love with Hilary Swank
I'm in love with Hilary Swank
Yeah, I'm in love with Hilary Swank
But she don't even know who mine
