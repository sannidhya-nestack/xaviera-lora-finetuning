There's a lady that I work
Who's really fond of me
I wanna give her my love
She's waiting patiently
Those sweet blue eyes look at me
Like she's deeply in love
Pretend a kiss is hard to resist
But it's not enough
To et you
Here I am hoping that you'll understand
I can't give you my heart when it's in the palm of your hand
So please release it, let me love again
There was so much wrong between me and you
I wanna get past that thing, start with someone new
She's been asking for a commitment, but how can I?
When I'd break her heart in a second, oh just for you
Here I am, hoping that you'll understand
I can't give her my heart when it's in the palm of your hand
So please release it, let me love again
I'm not really sure what I'm asking for, I don't know what to do
It's too hard to move on when I'm still in love with you
Here I am, hoping that you'll understand
I can't give her my heart when it's in the palm of your hand
So please release it, let me love again
