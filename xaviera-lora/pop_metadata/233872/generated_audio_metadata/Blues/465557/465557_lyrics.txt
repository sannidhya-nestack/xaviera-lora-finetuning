I've got no time for indecision
It makes me troubled and confused
My life could do with some revision
I got nothing, say I have nothing to lose
They say I'm overgrown and lazy
Them words are trifle overused
My smile may look a little hazy
I got nothing except nothing to lose
Well I try, try, try my, my, my to gain redemption
And time rolls past
Ain't nothing gonna last
So I better get walking
I'm wasting time talking to ya
I'm well aware the rain is falling
Trying to stay dry keeps me amused
Down the street your momma's callin'
She got nothin' except nothin' to lose
Well, I try, try, try my, my, my to gain redemption
And time rolls past, ain't nothing gonna last
So I better get walking cause I'm wasting time talking to ya
I'm willow where the rain is falling
Trying to stay dry keeps me amused yeah
Down the street your mama's calling
She got nothing, said nothing to lose
She got nothing, said nothing to lose
I got nothing, said nothing to lose
