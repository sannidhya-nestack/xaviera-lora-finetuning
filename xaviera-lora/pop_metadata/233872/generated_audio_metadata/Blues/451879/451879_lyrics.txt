I could've been a priest
I could've been a preacher
I could've tamed your beast
Or been your Sunday school teacher
I could've been anything until the spirit came to my door
I could've been a king
I could have been your savior
Kept you on a string
Or wrote your code of behavior
I could have been anything until the spirit came to my door
I could have been the judge
I could have been the jury
I could have fueled your grudge
I could have fueled your fury
I could have done anything until the spirit came to my door
I could have been sublime
I could have been a contender
I could have been prime time
I've been the greatest pretender
I could've been anything until the spirit came to my door
I could've been anything until the spirit came to my door
I could've been anything until the spirit came to my door
