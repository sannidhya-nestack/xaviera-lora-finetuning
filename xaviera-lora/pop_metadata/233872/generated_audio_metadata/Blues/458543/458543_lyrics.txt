To tell the truth, I'm misunderstood
I never had a thing against doing good
But when I see a full moon, I can't stop howling
Or tasty little poodle, I can't keep from growling
I'm a bad dog and I can't change
Ain't no ointment for this kind of mange
If it itches, I scratch
If it tickles I kick
If it smells I sniff
If it's nasty I lick
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad dog
I once caught a fat Siamese cat, oh boy
Gave it a nice Chinese name, "Chu Toy"
But just because I chase squirrels and cats and cars
That's no reason to put me behind these bars
I spent a year of hard time here in this pen
And you know in dog years that's seven to ten
I'm bustin' out, but it sure is a crime
So many hydrants, so little time
I'm a bad dog, and I can't change
Ain't no ointment for this kind of mange
If it itches, I scratch
If it tickles, I kick
If it smells, I sniff
If it's nasty, I lick
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad dog
I might fetch your slippers and bring'em to you
But they'll be covered with slobber and a little chewed too
I don't roll over or shank or sit
I don't know how those other mutts put up with that stuff
I once took a try at obedient school
But I must have broken some cardinal rule
While the other dogs were learning to sit up and beg
I was getting acquainted with the instructor's leg
Bad dog! Just trying to be friendly
Ain't no ointment for this kind of mange
If it itches I scratch
If it tickles I kick
If it smells I sniff
If it's nasty I lick
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad dog
Bad dog
I know I'm a heel, you don't have to tell me
Bad, bad, bad, bad dog
