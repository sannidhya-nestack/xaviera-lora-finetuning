Some people wanna take it slow
I'm gonna rock it on that dough
I'm gonna let my head down low
Down to the floor
You know it's sweet, you know it's sticky
It's tasty and it's sticky
A little fizzy, a little tingly
Are you with me?
Raspberry, chocolatini, hot bikini
I stay steamy, little cocktail in my hand
Yeah, I got it on demand
Take a dip, let me get you wet
Drip, drip, let me make you sweat
Yeah, you can get it any way you want, any way you want
Shake'em, not stirred
Pinky out, make'em slur
Ooh yeah, now it's my turn
When I do it, I make it burn
Raspberry chocolatini, hot bikini
I stay steaming, no cocktail in my hand
Yeah, I got it on demand
Slide it over, let it splash
Velvet kisses, midnight flash
You and me in velvet scenes
Dancing through our sugar dreams
So sip it slow or chug it fast
This kind of love is built to last
Raspberry lips or chocolate teas
Come on baby, drink up the breeze
Raspberry Chocolatini, come on baby, I'm so dreamy
Raspberry Chocolatini, come on baby, i'm so dreamy
Raspberry Chocolatini, come on baby, I'm so dreamy
