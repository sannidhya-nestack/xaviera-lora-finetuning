He sees you're all alone
He sees your weakness shown
When you are falling apart
Susceptibility is all he needs to see
So he can poison your heart
You might try a substance
Take away your blues
Better watch out
He will say it's his chance to send you off to hell, there is no doubt, yeah
You may think you're fine, never gonna give in to the night, mmm, yeah
He's saying you are mine, got his hooks in deep and that's your plight, yes it is
So you say Satan won't you go away
Satan I don't wanna play
Satan won't you leave me alone
Satan won't you go away
Satan I don't wanna play
Satan won't you leave me alone
Why don't you go on home
He knows you have love
That you can't rise above
He's gonna play on that fact
He knows you're desperate
You will say yes to it
He's gonna get you to act
You might find a woman
A creature of the night will take you in
That fits right into his plan
He knows you aren't strong enough to win
No, no
You may think you're fine
Never gonna give in to the night
No, you're not
He is saying that you're mine
Got his hooks in deep
But that's your blind
Yes, yes
So you say, say won't you go away
Say I don't wanna play
Say won't you leave me alone
Say won't you go away
Say I don't wanna play
Say won't you leave me alone
Why don't you go on home
Yeah leave me alone
Go on home now, yeah
