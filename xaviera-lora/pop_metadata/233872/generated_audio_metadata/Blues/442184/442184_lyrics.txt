Now baby, why do you treat me so bad?
Oh baby, I'm like a dog that's gone mad
You know I love you baby
You're the best friend this mutt's ever had
Oh baby
Why do I feel like a fool
Oh baby, you know you're making me drool
Pull my leash baby, so I can walk down the street looking cool
Oh baby, you know I feel so alone
Oh now baby, I'm like a dog with no bone
Now when you pet me baby, it's the best feeling this dog has ever known
Oh now baby
I've got the doggone blues
Oh baby
I wanna fetch you your shoes
Uh huh
You know I want you baby
I hope it's me you're gonna choose
I got the dog on blues
I got the dog on blues
Got the dog on blues
Got them dogs on blues
