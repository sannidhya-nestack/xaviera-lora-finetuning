I woke up this morning
Had that red-eyed whiskey
It was on my mind
On my mind
I woke up this morning
Had that red-eyed whiskey
On my mind
You know I stayed up all last night
But today I'm feeling fine, feeling fine
Some people try to tell me, Lord that I'm crazy, crazy
People try to tell me, they think that I'm insane, think that I'm insane
But you just give me red-eyed whiskey
You can have all the pain
