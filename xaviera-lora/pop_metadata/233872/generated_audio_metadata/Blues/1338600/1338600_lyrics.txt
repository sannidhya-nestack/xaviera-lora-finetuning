Heard the door close extra tight
Wondering if I'll see you tonight
I'm not ready to say goodbye
Took me a while to realize I'm falling
I love you
Better every day
Give me a chance to say
I love you
I love you
Prayin' three words mean the same to you
And that you won't tell me we're through
Skies might seem a little grey
Feel a storm headin' my way, I'm fallin'
Better every day, give me a chance to say I love you, I love you
ive me for not knowing how
I'm ready now to take a vow
I love you
Better every day
Give me a chance to say
I love you
I love you
