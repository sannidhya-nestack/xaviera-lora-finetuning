I was looking for adventure
With a guitar in my hand
I was searching for a new life
But this thing ain't got to plan
Now I'm in the Windy City
And I've got Chicago blues
And this feeling ain't so pretty
When you got Chicago blues
Thought I found my new salvation
When I met that sweet Marie
But she took all my possessions
Ran away to New Orleans
Now I'm in the Windy City
And I've got Chicago blues
And this feeling ain't so pretty
When you got Chicago blues, Chicago blues
I'll wrap
So I roam the lonely sidewalk
Not a dollar to my name
And I'm thinking of the bad times
Drowning slowly in the rain
Now I'm in the windy city
And I've got Chicago blues
And this feeling ain't so pretty yeah
When you got Chicago blues, Chicago blues
Chicago blues, Chicago blues
My Chicago blues
My Chicago blues, blues, Chicago blues, blues, my Chicago blues
