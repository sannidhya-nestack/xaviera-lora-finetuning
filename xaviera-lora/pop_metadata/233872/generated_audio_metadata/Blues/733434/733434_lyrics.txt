She's a hot-blooded woman, call that girl my sweet Marie
Oh she my big mama, thought she was the girl of my dreams
She turns heads when she's on your arm
But ain't nothing ever as good as it seems
Well, sweet Marie is high maintenance
Spend my dollar on real fine clothes
Designer clothes, no less
Yet she high maintenance
Her hair and nails and all those kinky
How he'll choose
That when she loved me through the night
Man, I would sell my soul
And et about those money gone blues
Marie can drink you under the table
And knock you to the floor
Love you three times a day
Then she's come back for more
Willie Brown tried to warn me
Said she done a fool on him
That's Wade Murray
Oh she ewed up all his dollar
Then found herself another man
Ha that was me
Sorry Willie Brown
Sweet Marie won't ever change
But man we had some fun
Lord we had some fun
Sweet Marie won't ever change
And guess I'll do it all again
Lord
That girl used up my dollar
In the morning Sweet Marie was gone
That girl be the death of me
Sweet Marie gave me the mean old money gone blues (oh lord yeah)
Sweet Marie gave me the mean old money gone blues
(oh lord yeah)
She used up all my dollar and found herself another fool (no fool, like an old fool, no, no)
Sweet Marie gave me the mean old money gone blues
Worth every dollar, sweet Marie K. and me
The mean old money gone blues
Oh, I'm selling my dime, dime, dime
Used up all my dollar, I finally sell my dime
Oh, another fool, I'm just that girl
