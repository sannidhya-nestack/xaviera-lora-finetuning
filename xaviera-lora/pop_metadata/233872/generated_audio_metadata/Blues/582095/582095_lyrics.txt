Hello loneliness
So good to see your smile again
You're always right there beside me
Just like a real old time friend
Hello loneliness
It's good to see my friend again
Hello, moonshine
Shining on the dark sea
You look so lonesome
Not half as lonely as me
Hello moonshine
It's good to see my friend again
Hello pocket
So good to dig deep into ya
Reaching for the money that I spent
Coming up with a fist full of blue
Hello empty pocket
It's good to seem a friend again
Hello heartache
Weeping my mind like a slave
When I hold my soul
Just like a mountain at the top of grief
Hello heartache
Well it's good to see my motherfuckin' farewell-a-friend again
