I sprained my ankle walking
Can't go dancing with you
Doctors just informed me
That now I've got the flu
My bills piling up so high so fast
I don't know what to do
My life is really sucking
I just can't seem to win
No one wants to love me
I'm flat out broke and I've got pathetic blues
Your house is all in a shambles
Broken up on every side
Kids are taking over the whole house
You've got no place to hide
I heard your baby left you
Just walked away one night
Too bad
Life is really something, oh
You just can't seem to win
No one wants to love you
You're flat out broken, you've got perfected blues
Our neighborhood's getting run down
Big community meeting tonight
We've got no money to fix it
There's no solution in sight
That's right
Economy is such a big mess
Our weather patterns are going berserk
We're all blaming each other
We've got no hope and we've got pathetic blues
A whole world's in an uproar
A turbulence everywhere
So much hate and anger
We've got no hope and we've got pathetic blues
Pathetic blues
Pathetic blues
Pathetic blues
Oh mama, oh mama, oh mama, oh mama, oh mama
