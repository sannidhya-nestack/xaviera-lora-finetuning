Wake up for the sun rises
Got to pay my dues
Slip on my stockings and my high-heeled shoes
Put on my happy face
Pretend I like this place
But I can't wait to leave out the door
And drink away what I've been working for
Scratch and carve my way through the day
The money I make doesn't cover the bills I need to pay
Can't get a step ahead
Should keep this tired body in bed
But I think I'll just drink instead
I think I'll drink
I think I'll drink instead
Know where to rest my weary head
Should've kept myself in bed
But I think I'll just drink instead
I should do something with my life
I should buy a house, buy a car, become a wife
But I think I'd rather dream
I think I'll drink instead
Pass me my brandy, pass me my gin
Hey bartender give me one more round again
So many problems I should think of in my head
But I think I'll just drink instead
I think I'll drink
I think I'll drink instead
No way I'd rest my weary head
Should've kept myself in bed
But I think I'll just drink instead
