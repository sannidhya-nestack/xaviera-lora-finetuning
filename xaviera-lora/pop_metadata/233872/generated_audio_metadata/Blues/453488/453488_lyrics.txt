There's blood on the streets today baby
Just like there was yesterday
There's blood on the streets today baby
Just like there was yesterday
We'll be washing it off forever
Cause blood just can't wash blood away
It's raining all day today baby
Just like it was yesterday
It's been raining all day today baby
Just like it was yesterday
If the water keeps rising little baby
The river's gonna wash us away
The devil's outside our door, baby
Lock the door and turn out the light
The devil's outside our door, baby
Lock the door and turn out the light
He's been waiting there since morning
I know he'll be waiting there all night
Look out
The world is full of misfortunes
It follows us around every day
The world is full of misfortune
Follows us around every day
Let me hold you tight baby
I can chase all your troubles away
