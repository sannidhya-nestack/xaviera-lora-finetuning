Woke up this morning, scraped my brains off the floor
Crawled in the kitchen, ate some coffee, screamed some more
Can you tell me just one more time what the hell went on?
Now, let me get this straight, you say I did what?
And after that bottle of bovin', you say I drank what?
Just tell me one more time, are you really sure that's what the hell went on?
Well, here I sit on this floor
And you know my head's about to explode
You keep sayin' that there is more
I don't know if I can handle this kind of a overload
Dear God, please just get me through this
I swear I'll go back to church, hell, I'll even give up cussin'
You see, dear God, I now know just what the hell went on
Well here I sit on this floor
You know my head's about to explode
You say that there is more
I don't know if I can handle this kind of a overload
Dear God please just get me through this one
I swear I'll go back to church hell I'll even give a pressing
You see dear God I now know just what the hell we're on
I really must avoid this from what I've now been told
I probably shouldn't have mixed that vape and gas and gin
I just can't believe I didn't die from what the hell you say went on
I guess I need to get on out and get my clothes up off the lawn
I'm sure the neighbors have been talking from what the hell you say went on
I just can't believe the cops didn't show up from what the hell went on
Well here I sit on this floor
You know my head's about to explode
You keep sayin' that there's more
I don't wanna know if I can handle this kind of a overload
Dear God, please just get me through this and
I swear I'll go back to church, hell, I'll even give up cussin'
You see, dear God, I now know just what the hell a windhole
Oh God, do I know, jeez, uh!
