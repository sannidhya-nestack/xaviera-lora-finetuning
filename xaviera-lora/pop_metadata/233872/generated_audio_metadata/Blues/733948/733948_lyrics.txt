I'm going to go ahead and get started.
There's a bad vibe calling
It's knocking at my door
There's some dark clouds forming
Take shelter from the storm
No way out
There's shadows on the wall
When the bandwagon starts to call
There's a blue mood coming
It's racing down the track
Like a steam train roaring
Keeps chugging on my back
Oh yeah
No way out
When the devil steals your mind
It's so hard to shake this vibe
There's a bad vibe calling
It's knocking at my door
There's some dark clouds forming
The sky cries once more
Oh yeah yeah yeah
No way out
From shadows on the wall
The bad vibe takes it all, no way out
When the devil steals your mind, no way out
It's so hard to shake this vibe
There's a bad vibe callin'
