You make me crazy, crazy in love with you, oh you're my baby
So why do I feel blue, you make me crazy
When you stay out all night, I feel so lonely
When I'm alone at night
When you're away I cry myself to sleep
I close my eyes I see you
In my dreams you make me crazy
I'd like to hold you
Yeah, squeeze you oh so tight
I love you baby
Don't love just feel so right, you drive me crazy
When you say you love me, oh, then you leave me
How could you set me free when you're away
I cry myself to sleep, I close my eyes, I see you
In my dreams you make me crazy
Uh-huh
When you're away, I cry myself to sleep
I close my eyes, I see you in my dreams
You drive me crazy, uh huh
You drive me crazy, uh huh
You make me crazy
Crazy
