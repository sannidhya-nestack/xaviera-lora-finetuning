I'm just a slip slap daddy in the heat of the night out on the avenue
I see a shining star dressed like a girl in a bar
That's when I made my move only for you
And the way she touches me she's got an attitude
We're in a smokey field diving in the back of the room
And it's a sneaky scene
I'm acting all tough and dirty and she's eating it up
She never liked it clean
Shiny and new
And the way she touches me
She's got an attitude
As they are kindred eyes, they hypnotize
I gotta say
Uh huh, I'll play it cool for you honey
Uh huh, I'll play it cool, I'll play it cool
Uh huh, I'll play it cool for you, honey
Uh huh, I'll play it cool
I'll use my sexy walk and sexy talk
How can a girl refuse?
I told her fancy lies so she would fantasize
I even sang the blues only for you
And the way she touches me she's got an attitude
I say her kindred eyes they hypnotize
I gotta say
Uh-huh, I'll play it cool for you, honey
Uh-huh, I'll play it cool
I'll play it cool
Uh-huh, I'll play it cool for you, honey
Uh-huh, I'll play it cool
I'll play it cool
Ah-ha, ah-ha
Ah-ha, ah-ha
Ah-ha, ah-ha
Ah-ha, ah-ha
Room 143 was our destiny out on the second floor
She threw her purse on the chair and all her clothes in the air
That's when I shut the door and took off my shoes
And the way she touches me she's got an attitude
I say again should I stay hypnotized
I gotta say
Uh huh, I play it cool for you honey
Uh huh, I play it cool, I play it cool
Uh huh, I play it cool for you honey
Uh huh, I play it cool, I play it cool
Uh huh, uh huh
