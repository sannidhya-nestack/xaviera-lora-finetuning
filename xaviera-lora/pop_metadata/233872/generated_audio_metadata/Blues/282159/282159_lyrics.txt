Don't come knocking at my door
Don't come knocking, not anymore
Don't come knocking at my door
You're like a dog without a bone
Why don't you leave me alone
Don't come knocking, don't come knocking
Had your chance, we already danced this dance
I'll still make it through the night
But don't come knockin' at my door
You're like a cat without a home
Why don't you go out and roam
But don't come knockin', don't come knockin'
Oh no baby enough is enough
Had your fun but you was treating me rough
Don't come knocking at my door
You made yourself a king and me a hurting thing
Don't come knocking don't come knocking
You can tell me this, you can tell me that
You know babe, I won't take you back
Don't come knockin' at my door
You made yourself a king and me a hurtin' thing
So don't come knockin', don't come knockin'
No, don't come knockin' at my door
Don't come knockin' not anymore
Don't come knockin' at my door
Don't come'round here
Don't come knockin' not anymore
