Sitting here thinking how we've gone wrong
The love we had, is it broken and gone?
Those warm loving kisses that we once shared
A stroke of your cheek, a brush of your hair
Are all of these things just a part of our past?
Do you think our love will last?
Can you remember how it used to be
Our love was strong and as deep as the sea
But now we both sleep in our two separate rooms
Living each day under this cloud of doom
Are we both scared by the pain that we've caused
Do you think we can get back to the way it was
I still love you baby, now there ain't no doubt
Climb any mountain just to shout it out
I hope you feel the same way too
Couldn't go on in this life without you
Now these are just a few of my thoughts
Do you really think our love is lost?
