I'm a little bit tired
I'm a little bit mad
I'm a little bit crazy
For the loving we once had
I'm a little insecure
I'm a little to blame
I'm a little bit mixed up on how to play this game
Yeah, I'm crazy for you
A little bit crazy but it's true
I'm a little bit tired
I'm a little bit sad
I'm a little unsure on what we once had
A little bit pushed
And a little bit shoved
A little bit used up but I ain't had enough
Yeah, I'm crazy for you
A little bit crazy but it's true
I'll go crazy for you
A little bit crazy but it's true
We could sit in the sun and watch the world go by
A radio pumping out our favorite tunes
Break out the moonshine and have us a good time
I know you're gonna shine on every morning me
Morning me, morning me
We could sit in the sun and watch the world go by
Our radio pumping out our favorite tunes
Let's break out the guitars and have us a good time
I know it's gonna take a little bit of fire
A little bit of rain, shake her to flame
Me and wash away my pain
Got a fever that's burning, burning deep inside
Got a hungry desire, I ain't gonna hide
I'm crazy for you
A little bit crazy but it's true
I go crazy for you
A little crazy and it's true
I go crazy for you
A little bit crazy but it's true
Crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy but it's true
Crazy for you
Yeah, crazy but it's true
Crazy but it's true
Crazy for you
A little bit crazy and it's true
Crazy but it's true
Crazy but it's true
Crazy but it's true
Uh, ooh, crazy but it's true
Uh, ooh, crazy but it's true
