Well, I'm a pregnant woman
I've got a baby on board
Yeah, I'm a pregnant woman
My size can't be ignored
Well, I don't like to be a cynic
But I think I could open a weight gain clinic
I'm a pregnant woman
I've got a baby on board
I'm a pregnant woman
Sometimes the sweetest can be
Yeah, I'm a pregnant woman
But don't mess with me
My body is swollen, my hormones are raging
I bounce between aggravated and engaging
I'm a pregnant woman
Don't mess with me
Well, I'm tired all the time
Maybe it's iron-pored blood
Yeah, I'm tired all the time
I feel like a dud
I've got backaches, heartburn, varicose veins
Shortness of breath and assorted pains
Yeah, I'm tired all the time
I feel like a duck
Well, I'm a pregnant woman
I got the baby on board blues
Yeah, I'm a pregnant woman
I got the baby on board blues
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
