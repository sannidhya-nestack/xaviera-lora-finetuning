This morning I woke up on the right side of the bed
Feeling like a million good thoughts in my head
I'm in the pocket
I'm in the pocket
Don't you try to bring me down because I'm happiness bound
I'm in the pocket
Stumbled into the bathroom looked in the mirror
I did a double take who is that handsome dude in there
I'm in the pocket
I'm in the parking
Blues stay out of my way
today's my day
I'm in the parking
I looked outside, saw it was raining in the street
That's okay rain, you can't fall on me
I'm in the pocket
I'm in the pocket
I got ready to start and the clouds began to part
I'm in the pocket
I went to find my car keys, didn't even have to look
I fired up the engine and the gas tank was full
I'm in the pocket
I'm in the pocket
And I'm driving down the road with a heart full of soul
I'm in the pocket
This morning I woke up on the right side of the bed
Feeling like a million good thoughts in my head
I'm in the pocket
I'm in the pocket
Don't you try to bring me down because I'm happiness bound
I'm in the pocket
I'm in the pocket
I'm in the pocket
Don't you try to bring me down because I'm half of this mound
I'm in the pocket
