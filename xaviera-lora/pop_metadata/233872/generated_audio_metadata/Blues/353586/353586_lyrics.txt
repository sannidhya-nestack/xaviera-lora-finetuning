You're lovin' the wrong man
I've tried to tell you honey you're lovin' the wrong man
You're lovin' the wrong man
I've tried to tell you honey you're lovin' the wrong man
I've known all along that he can't love you in the way that I can
You're kissing the wrong man
I've tried to tell you girl you're kissing the wrong man
You're kissing the wrong man
I've tried to tell you honey you're kissing the wrong man
I'm known all along now that he can't kiss you in the way that I can
You're dumping the right man
I've known all along
You're dumping the right man
You're dumping the right man
I've known all along
You're dumping the right man
I've known all along that he couldn't love you in the way that I can
You're loving the right man now
I've known all along you're loving the right man now
You're loving the right man
I tried to tell you honey you're loving the right man now
I've known all along that nobody can love you
In the way that I can now
(Humming)
