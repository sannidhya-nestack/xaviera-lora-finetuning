I'm a diva
Be-la-da-da-da-la-la-la-la
Diva
Da, da, da, da, yeah
Got some coffee, got some tea
Oh, but it'd be nice to have some company
I ain't got nobody
'Cause my baby's got somebody new
Well, I've been watching all the late late shows
I ain't got nowhere else to go
I ain't got nobody
Yeah,'cause my baby's got somebody new
They say Jack should be nimble, Jack should be quick
And he was, and he took off with my good lookin' stick
I don't know about this tale of a war
Put me out of my misery, I can't take it no more
My friends call me early, well they even call me late
Lord knows I ain't got no date
I ain't got nobody
my baby's got somebody new
I don't bother with it
Beep-bada-bada-boom
I'm in a world where I'm free
A-de-ba-de-de-ba-ba-ba-ba-boom
Ba-de-de-be-be-be-be yeah yeah yeah yeah
A-de-ba-de-de-be-be
Beep-bada-bada-boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Ba-de-be-be-be-be yeah yeah yeah yeah
They say Jack should be nimble and Jack should be quick
Well he was and he took off with my lickin' stick
I don't know about this tale of woe
So put me out of my misery I can't take it no more
My, well the sun shines early through my window pane
So every time I look out why do I think it's gonna rain
I ain't got nobody
Lord my baby's got somebody new
I ain't got nobody
Oh my baby's got somebody new
I ain't got no bad day, I ain't got no bad day, I ain' got no bad day, I ain't got no bad day
I ain't got nobody, I ain't got nobody, I ain't got nobody, I ain't got nobody, I ain't got nobody
