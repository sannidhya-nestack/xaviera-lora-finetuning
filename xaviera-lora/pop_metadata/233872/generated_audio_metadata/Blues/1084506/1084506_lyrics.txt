Some folks like them short
Others like them tall
And some people like them big
And some of us like them small
So I'm gonna tell you why
You can like them all
If they wiggle when they walk
If they move that away
She's got a wiggle in her walk
A swing and a sway
They say nobody's perfect but that's just a cliché
If you can wiggle that away
And some people like them strong (strong)
Others like them weak
Some folks like them tough (tough)
Some of us like them meek
I'm gonna tell you why
You can like them seven days in a week
If they wiggle when they walk (mmm)
When they move their way
She's got a wiggle and a walk
A swing and a sway
They say nobody's perfect but that's just a cliché
If you can wiggle that away
She's got a wiggle in her walk (got a wiggle in her walk)
When she moves that way (got a wiggle in her walk)
She's got a wiggle in her walk (got wiggle in her walk)
A swing and a sway (got a wiggle in her walk)
They say nobody's perfect but that's just a cliché
If you wiggle, wiggle, wiggle there
