Barbecue and blues, some brews and my baby
You know it's gonna be alright
Barbecue and blues, some brews and my baby
You know it's gonna be alright
there ain't nothing in this world besides that
That I need tonight
I got the grill fired up with the musket wood
Got ribs on the rack and they're smelling so good
Got baked beans cooking
Potato salad tasting divine
Well it's a Sunday afternoon and the sun is gonna shine
With some real good friends of mine
My baby just walked in and she's looking so fine
She's got a six pack of china and a bottle of wine
Here comes my buddy Jimmy with a girl we all call skinny
They brought some CDs I got to hear me some of these
This party's shaping up in a real good way
Looks like a real good day to step outside and play
Barbecue and blues, some brews and my baby
You know it's gonna be alright
Barbecue and blues, some brews and my baby
You know it's gonna be alright
'Cause there ain't nothing in this world besides that, that I need tonight
Later next week at the park right down the street
They'll have the best blues bands from all around the land
We'll all do what we can as dedicated fans
By standing in the long line at their merchandise stands
All for the bands
Barbecue and blues, some brews and my baby
You know it's gonna be alright
Barbecue and blues, some brews and my baby
You know it's gonna be alright
'Cause there ain't nothing in this world besides that
That I need tonight
Hey, yeah, alright
there ain't nothing in this world besides that
That I need tonight
Ha, gonna have a party tonight
there ain't nothing in this world besides
That that I need tonight
