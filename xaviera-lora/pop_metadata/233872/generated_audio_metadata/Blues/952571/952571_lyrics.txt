We've got heavy rollers, baby
And that's a fact
It always happens when I'm losing tracks
I'm in deep, deep waters
I'm over my head
But I just can't wait one lifetime just for you
This city nightlife really drags till dawn
My senses tell me that I'm overdrawn
There is no ending to this overspending
But I just can't wait one lifetime just for you
I'm like a fallen rider
Although I'm thrown to the ground
I keep my eyes on your face
There ain't one hair that's out of place
Please can't you see the shape that I'm in
I crossed this bridge of fortune like those other fools
Both blind and crippled to the working rules
There's no denying half the world is crying
But I just can't wait one lifetime
No, I just can't wait one lifetime
I'm like a fallen rider
Although I'm thrown to the ground
I keep my eyes on your face
Not one hair is out of place
But can't you see the shape that I'm in?
We've got heavy rollers baby, that's a fact
It always happens when I'm losing tracks
I'm in deep deep waters
I'm over my head
But I can't wait one lifetime
I just can't wait one lifetime
Can't wait one lifetime
And I won't wait one lifetime
Can't wait a lifetime
I just won't wait one lifetime
Wait a lifetime over you
