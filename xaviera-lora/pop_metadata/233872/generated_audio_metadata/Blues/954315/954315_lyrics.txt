Gonna book the ride
On the midnight train
Going on a journey
That I have to take
It's a place where you find truth
Destination blues
Guess I know what's there
When I touch the ground
On a blue vacation
Different place same old frown
Find it hard to et you
Destination blues
Find the truth
Gonna find some faith
Try to work it out
Need to shake this feeling
Gonna make it somehow
Finally learn to et you
Destination blues
So I book my ride
On the midnight train
Going on a journey
To relive all the pain
It's a place where you find truth
Destination blues
Find it hard to et you
Destination blues
And I hope I can break through destination blues
