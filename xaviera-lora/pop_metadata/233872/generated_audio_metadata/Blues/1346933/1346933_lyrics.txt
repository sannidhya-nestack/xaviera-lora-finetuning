And having been a singer in a rock and roll band
Had many girls from across the land
They loved me for playing a mean guitar
And I was drawn to you by your eyes of blue
You reminded me of someone I once knew
But you weren't impressed by me being a star
We laughed, we joked, we shared a smoke
We even carved our names on a tree of oak
But I got the feeling we'd met before
I was captivated by your mysterious smile
The way you dressed in incredible style
And your mood like you owned the dance floor
Tears of pain keep falling like rain
I cry out for you but my tears are in vain
The nightmares I have are always the same
Only you will be able to stop my tears of pain
We decided to go outside to look at the moon
I went in for a kiss but you said it was too soon
I couldn't hide my disappointment but had to agree
You requested a song about someone you love
Torn from your arms by the good lord above your heart
Still unable to set you free
Tears of pain keep falling like rain
I cry out for you but my tears are in vain
The nightmares I have are always the same
Only you will be able to stop my tears of pain
I've played many a tune about heartache before
But this is a heartache I don't want to play no more
But our time will come when we're together again, I'm sure
You were the missing link in my heart
And through no fault of our own we were torn apart
But I'll be waiting when you walk through heaven's door
Tears of pain keep falling like rain
I cry out for you but my tears are in vain
The nightmares I have are always the same
Only you will be able to stop my
You would be in my heart, big old stew of pain
Your tears of pain
Tears of pain keep falling like rain
I cry out for you but my tears are in vain
The nightmares I have are always the same
Only you will be able to stop my tears of pain
