And my mind was made up, well I got no doubt
As sooner or later baby, they're gonna find out
Guess what I did was a bad thing, but I was racing with the wind
Smoke was high and my tires were burning
I jumped that gun again for a little red
Little Red, she's back
I mean her that a junkyard dog, Little Red
And after the juke joint jive
We drove out to see the moon
She said well I don't love ya and I don't need ya
There's something you can do for little Red
Oh little Red
She said don't go wasting my time
Get it on while that moon still shines
Little Red
Oh, Little Red, she's bad
I mean her better than a junkyard dog
Show me what you got, Little Red
Oh, Little Red, Little Red, she's bad
I mean her than a junkyard dog, Little Red
They said that girl too young
To do the things her mommy done
Little Red, Little Red, oh you're bad
I mean it that a junkyard doll
Little Red, you're bad, love that girl
