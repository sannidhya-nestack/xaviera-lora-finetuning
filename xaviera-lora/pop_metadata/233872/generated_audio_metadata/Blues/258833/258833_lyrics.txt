There ain't no other love ever compared to you
You've got to trust me now
I've searched my whole life through
Been'round this great wide world
Found only one thing that's true
There ain't no other love like you
There ain't no other life that I would rather do
Than be here right by your side helping us both get through
Been round this great wide world found only one thing that's true
There ain't no other love like you
All the men they might need to wander off and sometimes they fall
But all I ever need is to be with you in our home
And anytime I get lost
I'm not sure I can face it all
I just look into your eyes and I see
All I need to know
There ain't no other love
Could ever compare to you
You got to trust me now
I've searched my whole life through
Been round this great wide world
Found only one thing that's true
There ain't no other love like you
There were times I know
When I struggled to understand what I had
Oh, I got confused, girl
By the way the world lays its traps today
But just when I almost fell
And I let the whole thing go to bed
I remembered, I remembered
And I just turned and walked away
There ain't no other left
Could ever compare to you
Oh, you've got to trust me now
I've searched my whole life through
Been'round this great, great, great wide world
But found only one thing that's true
There ain't no other love like you
I'm no other, I'm no other, no, no, no, no
I found what I've been looking for
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby
There ain't no other love like you
