Went down to Tin Pan Alley
See what was going on
Way too hot down there
I couldn't stay very long
Ah, yeah
It's the roughest place
I've ever been
All the people down there
Living for the whiskey, wine and gin
I heard the shotgun ring
I saw the 44
Man got shot dead right there at that crap table
He wouldn't shake, rile and roll no more
It's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there
They live in a pool of whiskey
Crack, heroin, anything
Wine and gin
Went down to Tin Pan Alley
To see what was going on
It's way too hot down there
I couldn't stay very long
Oh yeah
It's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there
They're living for the whiskey, wine and gin
I heard a shotgun ring
I saw the 44
Man got shot dead right there at the crap table
He wouldn't shake, rattle, and roll, oh no, no more
It's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there
They're livin' for the whiskey, wine, anything
They're livin' for the whiskey, wine and gin
