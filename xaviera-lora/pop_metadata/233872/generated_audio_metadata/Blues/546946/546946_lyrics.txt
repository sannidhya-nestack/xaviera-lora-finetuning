Mmm, oh yeah, oh yeah
I try to tell my baby
I ain't been messin' around
But you give me the evil eye
And I feel I wanna die
I'm thinking of drinking sheep shower messing right
But I ain't been messing around
My shirt kind of dirty
I was missing a shoe
I came home late last night
With my head hung down
When I came home late last night
With my head hung down
But I ain't been messing around
I call up the doctor for a person to cure
My baby's not loving me like she did before
She thinks I've been messing around
But I ain't been messing around, Lord
Let me tell you something babe
I ain't been messing around
Alright
I tried to tell my baby
I ain't been messing around
She gave me the evil eye
And I feel I wanna die
I never cheated on my baby
She's the best thing that I've found
And I ain't been messing around
I ain't been messing around, no, no, no
I tried to tell my baby, I ain't been messing around
I tried to tell my baby, I ain't been messing around
I ain't been messing around
I ain't been messing around
