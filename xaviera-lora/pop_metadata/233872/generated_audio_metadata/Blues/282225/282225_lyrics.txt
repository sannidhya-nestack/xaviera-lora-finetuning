You know life can be hard, sometimes you can't get no rest
Never said it would be easy, always being put to the test
But just for you, I got a special place
It's mighty sweet and right down the street
I'll meet you at the station
Bluesville is our destination
Goin' to Bluesville
Baby, I will meet you there
I'm going to Bluesville, baby I will meet you there
There in Bluesville you can really let down your hair
Come on and shine your shoes
Come on fix your dress
Cause honey you know I want you looking your best
You got an attitude and nothing to lose
You can all leave your troubles and get down with the blues
I'll meet you at the station
Bluesville is our destination
I'm going to Bluesville
Baby I will meet you there
Well I'm going to Bluesville
Baby I will meet you there
Damn Bluesville you can really let down your hair
I ain't tired no more, is it time to go?
I sure am ready to get down with the show
Some people never get it straight
They think Bluesville is a real sad place
They don't know, it just ain't so
Bluesville is the best damn place to go
Goin' to Bluesville?
Honey, I will meet you there
Gone to Bluesville, honey I will meet you there
There in Bluesville you can really let down your hair
