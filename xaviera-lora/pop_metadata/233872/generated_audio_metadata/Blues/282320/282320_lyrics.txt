The streets are moving faster than I am
And the lights are shining brighter than my eyes can see
And I'm so tired of that same old story
Kindness makes me cry
I greet cruelty with dry eyes
I've been turned upside down
In and out and all around
I got a tiger by the tail
If I turn it loose it will devour me
And all those babies born after the atomic bomb
What kind of horrible fate are we waiting on?
I need some answers, I want to make a future somehow
Better do it now
But those streets are moving faster than I am
And the lights are shining brighter than my eyes can see
And I'm so tired of that same old story
Different versions of the truth
Are twisted into lies
It just brings me down but I won't close my eyes
And those answers blowing in the wind
Don't you think it's time they touched down?
Physical pain it comes and goes
Emotional pain is always there
People stop and stare but they don't really care
And I could scream with all my being
And still not change one single thing
The streets are moving faster than I am
And the lights are shining brighter than my eyes can see
And I'm so tired of that same old story
I'm so tired of it, so tired of it
The streets are moving faster than I am
And the lights are shining brighter than my eyes can see
And I'm so tired of that same old story
Yes, I'm so tired of that same old story
