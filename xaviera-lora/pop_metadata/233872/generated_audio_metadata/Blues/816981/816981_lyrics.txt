Standing on the corner playing for dimes
Staring at the people as they're passing by
They all turn away like they just don't care
Never notice that he's even there
With tear filled eyes
He sings a tune, yeah he sings a tune
When life was young and oh so new
A story of a man who once had it all
Now all that's left is his song
And he's singing now, "Heaven don't let me down"
Oh, I feel so blue
Heaven, don't let me down
I'm so lonesome, I need you to see me through
Sitting in the kitchen, the sun comes up
Holding tight to her coffee cup
Another sleepless night, another wasted cry
No he's not coming back and she don't know why
So she's crying now
Heaven don't let me down
Oh, I feel so blue
Heaven don't let me down
I'm so lonesome
I need you to see me through
Don't you know that destiny
Comes around to you and me
When we're searching for the truth
I know you love me, Jesus
I know you tell no lies
I need you to save me
And keep me satisfied
Heaven, don't let me down
Oh, I feel so blue
Heaven, don't let me down
I'm so lonesome, I need you
Heaven don't let me down
Oh, I feel so blue
Heaven don't let me down
I'm so lonesome, I need you to see me through
