Mmm, oh yeah
Well there's cracks in the ceiling
Cracks in the floor
Cracks in places I don't wanna go
There's break in my heart
And there's cracks in the ceiling
Cracks in the floor
There's a crack running right down the middle of my head
Something happened, I can't get a hold on
Something happened, I can't get control on
I can't stop myself, I can't help myself
My baby's driving me crazy
I got cracks in the ceiling, cracks in the floor
A crack running right through the middle of my head
That ain't all there's more
Well, last time I was shaken by an earthquake
It really got to me
Yeah, the foundations of the building
Was as shaky as can be
I couldn't help the earthquake
I can't help the way I feel about that man
Yeah, and I got cracks in my ceiling
I see cracks in the floor
Crack runnin' through the middle of my head
That ain't all, there's a hole in my soul
Ooh yeah
I can't seem to get it right
Sometimes I think he loves me
Then that love just disappears in a cold black line
Yeah, just when you think maybe this is it
You find yourself hugging the air
Striking out another hit and miss
Well there's cracks in the ceiling
Cracks in the floor
A crack running through the middle of my head
Oh there's more
Ooh baby
Oh there's more
Oh yeah
Ooh I wanna get a hold of this thing
I wanna feel whole again
But the cracks are in my ceiling
The cracks are in my floor
The cracks are running through the middle of my head
Can't take anymore, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah, oh
