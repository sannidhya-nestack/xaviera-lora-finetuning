Sittin' on the porch in my old rocking chair
People say I'm lazy but I don't care
I just like to watch the days go rolling by
I drink a little whiskey around midday
I got nothing else to do anyway
Happy to be in my Kentucky dream
And every night under the moon above
I drink a little more until I've had enough
Then I close my eyes and I drift away
And when I wake up it's another day
People say I'm just an old lazy bones
But I'm happy here in my Kentucky home
Happy to be in my Kentucky dream
And every night under the moon above
I drink a little whiskey until I've had enough
Then I close my eyes and I drift away
When I wake up, hey, it's another day
People say I'm just an old lazy bones
But I'm happy here in my Kentucky home
Happy to be in my Kentucky dream, that's right
I'm happy to be in my Kentucky dream
