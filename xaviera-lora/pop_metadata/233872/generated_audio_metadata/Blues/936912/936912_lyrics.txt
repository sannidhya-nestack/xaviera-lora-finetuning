Mmm, oh yeah
Up all day, up all night
Lay in darkness, got no fight
I'm alone in this world without you
You say you're coming back to me
Oh, but it's got no meaning, got no meaning
Pretty lies kept me believing
Broke my heart and you took the pieces
Broke my heart and you took the pieces
Your words are burned in my brain
You turned my dreams into a game
I know that it was just about you
Oh, the walls are closing around me in this room
Oh, but it's got no meaning, got no meaning
Pretty lies kept me believing
Broke my heart and you took the pieces
Broke my heart and you took the pieces
Oh, oh, oh
Drank a glass of un ettable
Loving you was so regrettable
It's got no meaning, got no meaning
Pretty lies kept me believing
Broke my heart and you took the pieces
You broke my heart and you took the pieces
It's got no meaning, got no meaning
Your pretty lies kept me believing
You broke my heart and you took the pieces
You broke my heart and you took the pieces
Oh, it's got no meaning, no
It's got no meaning
You broke my heart
You broke my heart
