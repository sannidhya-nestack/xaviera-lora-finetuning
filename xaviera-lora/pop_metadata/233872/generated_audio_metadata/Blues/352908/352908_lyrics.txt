Mary, come out of the kitchen
Get your boy down off the cross
Ask him all that he remembers
It's all on me, I'll ot
Joe, won't you take him fishing
Watch'em swimming back and forth
The water carries all its riches
Deeper than anybody's worth
And dogs are barking, they're coming down the trail
Crowd is restless and they wanna hear his tale
Tell him come back again next week
Right now he's too tired to speak
Can't you hear the rooster crowin'
So let your head begin to hurt
The night's a-dyin' and the day's beginnin'
Time to see all that you hurt
The thugs are howlin' they're comin' down the trail
What's behind them is a call not your name
Tell'em come back again next week
Right now you're too tired to speak
Won't you come back again next week
Right now, I'm too tired to speak
