I walk into a crowded room
There's something in the air
Before I even see you babe
I feel your presence there
I know I shouldn't look your way
I feel the urge, I try to fight
But like Persephone in Hades babe
Can't resist that first bite
The way you look at me
And my careful clothes
The smoldering eyes
Make me feel so exposed
The way you look at me
Makes my body weak
The way you look at me
I can feel your heat
You don't say you love me
You want something for free
Your eyes just say you'll have me
I can't disagree with the way you look at me
So many better choices
So many healthy desires
But all of your eyes promise, baby
To set me on fire
All the way you look at me
And my careful clothes
This smoldering eyes
Make me feel so exposed
The way you look at me
Makes my body weak
Oh, the way you look at me
Oh, I can feel your heat
You don't say you love me
Want something for free
Your eyes just say you have me
I can't do stuff the way you love me
The way you look at me
Oh, the way you look at me
