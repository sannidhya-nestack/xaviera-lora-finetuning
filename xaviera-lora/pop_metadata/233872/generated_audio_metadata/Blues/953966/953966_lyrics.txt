Mmm, yeah
On a moonlit night
You can hear the river sing
A soulful song
And see the shadow of the king
There's a rhythm in the breeze
The heartbeat of the city
It all comes together in perfect harmony
Under the Memphis Moon
That's where rock and roll fell in love with the blues
Down on Beale Street you can hear their children groove
Under the Memphis Moon
It's a haunting sound, you'll feel it down in your bones
Once it takes you over it won't leave you alone
Your feet will start moving, your hands will start clapping
The magic in the music will make it all happen
Under the Memphis Moon
That's where rock and roll fell in love with the blues
Down on Beale Street you can hear their children groove
Under the Memphis Moon
A lot of muddy water has flowed under this bridge
Caused a sensation that flooded the nation
And that celebration still lives
Blake Steve
Under the Memphis Moon
That's where rock and roll fell in love with the blues
Down on Beale Street you can hear their children groove
Under the Memphis Moon
Under the Memphis Moon
That's where rock and roll fell in love
With the blues under the Memphis moon
