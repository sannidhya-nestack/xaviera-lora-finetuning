And the world outside, it comes too cold
The one self-led church, the electric soul
Got a preacher that's been touched, another mojo man
He's got voodoo eyes, my kind of a holy man
If you feel like you've become too old
Just touch the cross and the church and the electric soul
Hold up the midnight mass, it's your holy wine
If it's a sign that you see, come at any time
It's the secret of the good book and the truth I've told
All sinners are redeemed in the church of the electric soul
Who find love eternal and salvation's goal
At the altar in the church of the electric soul
Just touch the cross in the church of the electric soul
