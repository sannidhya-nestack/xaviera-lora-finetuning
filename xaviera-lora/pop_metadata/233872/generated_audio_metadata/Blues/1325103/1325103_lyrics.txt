Good to see you, sure has been too long
You can't fool me, I know there's something wrong
I got a sympathetic ear, a shoulder for your tears
Take off your coat, I'll put some coffee on
Come in, kick off your blues and stay a while
Make yourself at home, no need to be alone tonight
Come on, pick up your chin, let's see you smile
Come in, kick off your blues and stay a while
Your poor old heart has sure seen better days
You look like you could use a change of pace
Come in, kick off your blues and stay awhile
Make yourself at home, no need to be alone tonight
Come on, pick up your chin, let's see you smile
Come in, kick off your blues and stay wild
Come in, kick off your blues and stay wild
Come and kick off your blues and stay awhile
