Mmm, mama say you better run for cover
Mama say you better save your soul
But somehow I don't believe what mama say
Oh when papa say you better hide your money
Papa say you better watch your back
But somehow I don't believe what papa say
I still believe about a day that's coming
I still believe love will find a way
I don't believe what others say
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Ooh, people say
This whole world's gone crazy
People say this whole world's gone mad
But somehow I don't believe what people say
Oh well some folks say there's a dark cloud above us
And some folks say all they see is rain
And some folks say this world
It's ending and I don't care what people say
I still believe a better day is coming
I still believe love will find a way
I don't believe what people say
Oh, what people say
I don't believe what people say, people say, people say
