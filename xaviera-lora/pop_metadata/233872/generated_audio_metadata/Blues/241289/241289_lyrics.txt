Take the shirt off my back
Take my dog, take my Cadillac
Take my pants, take my shoes
I got nothing left to lose
It happened just about a month ago
You said you hated me, you hated me so
That you're just about to leave
Right there on a New Year's Eve
I held you close, I wouldn't let you run
I couldn't stop what I'd begun
I wouldn't do the same today
And now I'm gonna have to pay
Take the shirt off my back
Take my dog and take my Cadillac
Take my pants
Take my shoes, I got nothing left to lose
Take it all, I don't care
Take my life, take it anywhere
Take my drugs, take my booze
I got nothing left to lose
I miss you so I wanna cry
Why did I hurt you, oh why, oh why
Now it's too late, too late to choose
I'm gonna have to sit here and sing the blues
Well, I told it to the lawyer, man
Said you'll never ever get me out of the pen
Well, I told the judge, he did refuse
I got nothing left to lose, alright
Take the shirt off my back
Take my dog, take my Cadillac
Take my pants, take my shoes
I got nothing left to lose
Take it all, I don't care
Take my life, take it anywhere
Take my drugs, take my booze
I got nothing left to lose
I got nothing, little darling, I got nothing left to lose
Ooh yeah, I got nothing baby
Ooh yeah, I got nothing, nothing left to lose
