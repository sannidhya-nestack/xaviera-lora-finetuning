I'm just the kind of girl
Who came to have some fun
I'm gonna shake it for you baby
From sun to sun
I got no croc to bear
No monkey on my back
You wanna have a good time
I am down with that
I'm just the kind of girl
Who came to have some fun
I'm gonna shake it for you baby
From son to son
Just the kind of girl
Who came to have some fun
You're headed down the street, you feel the summer heat
Yes, life is so good, it's so sweet
Now some people like to gossip'bout me and you
The lowdown things they say just ain't true
I'm just the kinda girl who came to have some fun
I'm gonna do it like Muddy Waters
Do it like Eddie James
I'm gonna shake it'til it's a crying shame
We're gonna rock this joint'til the night's black as coal
Gonna let the good times roll'til we satisfy your soul
And I'm just the kinda girl that all came to have some fun
All right, Michael, come on, babe
One more, come on, one more
I'm just the kind of girl who came to have some fun
I'm gonna shake it for you baby, yeah from sun to sun
I got no croc to bear, no monkey on my back
You wanna have a good time, I am down with that
Just the kind of girl who came to have some fun
Boy I'm gonna shake it for you baby
From sun to sun
I'm just the kind of girl who came to have some fun
