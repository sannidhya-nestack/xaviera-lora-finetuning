You've got a touch that makes me come undone
Well, I find you've been spreading that touch around
Should've seen those notches on the side of your bed
Playing out the games, baby, in my head
Now I got your number and it's all too clear
What am I doing here?
It's a long, long, long overdue
Coming baby, coming to the naked truth
I'm a long time overdue
Getting over you
I'm getting over you
I know this girl and I can guarantee
Those long legs and blue eyes they don't come for free
You remember every move while you et your pride
Trying real hard to try to get inside
Friends say you bought her some of them Jimmy Choos
Got your Mercedes too
And it's a long, long, long overdue
Coming baby, coming to the naked truth
I'm a long time overdue getting over you
I'm getting over you
What I thought was so good turned out to be wrong
And now I'm good as gone
Gone baby gone
Chasing honey with your platinum card
Playing to win, she's gonna tear you apart
I've been thinking all night about boarding a plane
Won't let you drive me or you'll drive me insane
Don't call me up lying'cause I lost my phone
I'll be lying on my own
And it's a lie
I'm a long, long, long, long time overdue
Coming baby, coming to the naked truth
I'm a long, long, long, long, long time overdue
I'm getting over you
I'm getting over you
I'm getting over you
