I woke up this morning and turned to kiss your head
All the sheets were empty and you had left my bed
I thought you were my baby boy, thought you were my friend
I thought that our sweet love affair would never see an end
I've been good, why you been so bad to me?
I've been good, why you been so bad to me?
I've been good, why you been so bad to me?
Well, I should've guessed you'd break my heart
I should've known your game
Should've known your cheating ways would leave me here in shame
I know things weren't perfect
I know we could fight
But tell me who were you running with and kissing on last night
I've been good, why you been so bad to me?
I've been good, why you been so bad me?
I've been good, why you been so bad to me?
I've been good, why you been so bad to me?
I've been good, why you been so bad me?
I've been good, why you been so bad to me?
I've been good, why you been so bad to me?
I've been good, why you been so bad me?
I've been good, why you been so bad, to me?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
