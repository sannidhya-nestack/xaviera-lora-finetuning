Well, lately I've been thinking it's not bad on my own
At least that's when I tell myself when I'm all alone
I don't need no lover to keep me company, no
All I need to get me through is good old misery
It's just me and myself and a bucket full of blues
Hanging on a Saturday night and I'm living it up
There's nothing loose
Things can only go right
I got one hell of a threesome
It's what you're looking at
It don't get much better than that
I'm talking about me and myself
And a bucket full of blues
Well, I got some cash to spend them
Got some time to waste
Nothing that I have with her can't be replaced
It's time to party, leave the past behind, oh yeah
And I know when it takes, y'all
Get that girl off my mind
It's just me and myself
In a bucket full of blues
Hanging on a Saturday night
And I'm living it up
There's nothing to lose
Things can only go right
I got one hell of a threesome
It's what you're looking at
It don't get much better than that
Just me and myself
And my bucket full of blue
Maybe down the road I'll turn my life around
Yes I will
But'til that day
I have to say that the only cure I found
Just me and myself and a bucket full of blues
Hanging on a Saturday night
And I'm living it up, there's nothing to lose
Things can only go right
I've got one hell of a threesome, it's what you're looking at
It don't get much better than that
I'm talkin'bout me and myself, yeah
And a bucket full of blues, yeah
Me and myself, oh, and a bucket full of blues, yeah
It's just me and myself
And my bucket full of blue
