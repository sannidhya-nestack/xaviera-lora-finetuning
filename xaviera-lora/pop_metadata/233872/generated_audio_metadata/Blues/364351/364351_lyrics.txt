Ain't had no lovin' in a long, long time
Ain't had no kissin' don't want to call mine
Ain't had no lovin' in a long time
Ain't got no woman in my bed at night
Ain't got no woman squeeze and hold tight
Ain't had no lovin' in a long, long time
I walk a lonely street in a lonely town
In a lonely world without a woman around
Ain't had no lovin' in a long long time
I walk a lonely street in a lonely town
In a lonely world without a woman around
Ain't had no lovin' in a long, long time
Oh, ain't had no lovin', ain't had no lovin', ain't had no lovin'
Ain't had no lovin'
Ain't had no lovin'
In a long, long time
