Tell me a story baby
But don't you tell me a lie
I just want to hear the truth from you
Tell me a story baby
But don't you tell me no lie
I just want to hear the truth from you
I just want to know if you love me baby
The same way I love you
Well each and every morning
I wake up with the blues
And they follow me throughout the day
Each and every morning
I wake up with the blues
And they follow me throughout the day
If you can't ease my worried mind
I'll just be on my miserable way
Put your hands on my bible
And swear to tell me the truth
Let me ask a question of you
Put your hands on my bible
And swear to tell me the truth
Let me ask a question of you
I just wanna know if you love me baby
The same way that I love you
