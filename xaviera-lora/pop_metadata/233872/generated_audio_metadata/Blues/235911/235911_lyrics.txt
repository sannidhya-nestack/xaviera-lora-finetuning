We got married too young too soon
No money down, no pay, myself too
I had you believing that I could buy you the moon
Like a poor little rich girl born with a silver spoon
I'm so far in the room
All I can see is blues
They can take away my diamond rings
But it's you I hate to lose
I hate to lose you
When time gets tough money ain't enough
Baby can you show me what you really made of
Girl that's the way love flows
Might as well foreclose on the high of love, love, love, high of love
Worked my fingers to the bone
Seven days a week
For a high maintenance woman
And a candy for the key
She used to be so wonderful
Used to be so sweet
How can a girl like Cinderella
Turn into Super Freak
On to the rebar mine
Mmm, call me at the Cadillac
In the Cadillac
This time I'm leaving baby
You know I ain't coming back
I ain't coming back
And that's a fact, y'all
When times get tough
Money ain't enough
Baby, can you show me what's real and made of
Or that that's the way love goes
Might as well foreclose on the house of love, love, love, love, love
Oh yeah
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah
All your kissin' and huggin' only comes every now and then
Last time you loved me right I can't remember when
I was a henpecked husband but my patience grew thin
I came home a little early somebody else was peckin' the hen
From now on I'm gonna be a rolling stone
Sick and tired of trying to make this a house of home
It's going once, going twice, lock, stock and barrel
It's cheaper twice the price
When times get tough money ain't enough
Baby, can you show me what you're really made of
Oh, if that's the way love goes
Might as well fuck clothes on the house of love, oh yeah
Oh, if that's the way love goes
Might as well fuck clothes on the house of love, oh yeah
You'll ask her where love goes
Mining with a clone on the house of love, love, love, love, love
Oh, oh, oh, oh
