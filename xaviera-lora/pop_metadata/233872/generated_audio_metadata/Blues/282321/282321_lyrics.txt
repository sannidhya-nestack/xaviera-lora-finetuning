I want you to meet me, meet me, meet me at the bottom
Meet me, meet me, meet me at the bottom
Down by the railroad tracks
We'll have the wind against our back
I want you to meet me, meet me, meet me at the bottom
Meet me, meet me, meet me at the bottom
Take me to the bottom, yeah
I want you to meet me, meet me, meet me at the bottom
Meet me, meet me, meet me at the bottom
Down by the railroad tracks
We'll have the wind against our back baby
I don't care if you got the devil driving your flaming red Cadillac
I don't care if you got the first lady and the president sitting in the back
I want you to meet me, meet me, meet me at the bottom
Meet me, meet me, meet me at the bottom
Take me to the bottom right now yeah
I know you think you're just having a nightmare
You're going down that windy mountainside and the brakes don't work
And you're so scared you feel like your heart is gonna explode
You turn to the devil and you say, "Hey! Can't you stop this infernal machine?"
He says
You did a deal with me, son
This time you're gonna keep your end of the bargain
This time you're gonna come through
I want you to meet me, meet me, meet me at the bottom
Oh lord, and you turn to the first lady and the president sitting in the back
You say, "You've got power, can you stop it? Can you hold it back?"
They say, "Ha ha ha, we're working on it, son"
And the Pope and the lizard are staring at you
They want to convert you to Christianity
Ah, and the lizard is staring at you with those yellow eyes
And he hisses through his teeth, he says, "Extinction, son"
I want you to meet me, meet me, meet me at the bottom
Meet me, meet me, meet me at the bottom
Take me to the bottom right now, yeah
Somewhere between heaven and hell
Down by the railroad tracks
I will meet you there
You're gonna wanna get down on your knees
Begging me for what you think I got for ya
What you believe you really need
I want you to meet me
Meet me, meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me, meet me, meet me
Made me a lover
(Go, go, go, walk the dog, go, walk, go, walk, walk)
(Go, go, go, walk the dog)
