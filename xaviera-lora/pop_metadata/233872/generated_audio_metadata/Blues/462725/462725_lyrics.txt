Broken down, tumble haunted
Feeling low since you parted
Sometimes you don't know what you got'til you finally lose
Didn't mean to hurt you
Didn't think what I would do it
See the devil come down and took me
Threw me heart and soul into it
Didn't realize badness could be done from a having fun
Didn't realize badness could be done from a having fun
Broken down
Tumble harder
Feeling low
Since we've parted
Sometimes you don't know what you've got
Till you finally lose
No sometimes you don't know what you've got
Till you finally lose
If only I could see you
I'd get down on my knees
I'd ask for your iveness with every kind of plea
But you're gone baby gone baby gone baby gone gone gone
But you're gone baby gone baby gone baby gone gone gone
You've owned me I could see you
But you've gone far away
Found some other man to hurt you better
That's what the people say
Yeah you're gone baby gone baby gone baby gone gone gone
Yeah you're gone baby gone baby gone baby gone gone gone
Yeah, you're gone, baby, gone, baby, gone, baby, gone, gone, gone
