There you are, baby, just in the crossway
Tell you something, baby, you're sure looking fine today
And that's all I've got to say
Well, you've been running through my mind 24 hours a day
Broke the last weekend, you, you shot me down
You said there ain't no way, you could be with such a clown
Man that kinda made me frown
So I started drinking, then I ain't put the bottle down
I woke up this morning and I fell out of bed
I could've sworn baby, Jack Daniels was my friend
I feel like I've been kicked in the head
Well it could've been worse though baby
Could've been drinking old crow whiskey
