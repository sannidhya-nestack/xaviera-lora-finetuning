Welcome to class, for if you want it fast
You better listen to what I say
'Bout the bite and the sting of the birds and bees
Study our history, there ain't no mystery
We've been doing it since Adam and Eve
Born to woo and deceive, to strip and tear
And before your graduation
I'll show you what I've learned
I had an early education
In the art of being burned
Heartbreak 101
Let me show you how it's done
Here at the school where the golden rule
Is to do unto others and run
Heartbreak 101
Alright
When I was a student I wasn't very prudent
I thought love would win the day
But it didn't turn out that way
And I paid the price
I had a lover I never did recover
From the damage of her desire
When a passion that was hot as fire suddenly was ice
So in this institution
I want the world to see
There's gonna be a retribution, Lord
For what she did to me
Heartbreak 101
Let me show you how it's done
Here at the school where the golden rule
Is to do unto others and run
Heartbreak 101
Oh let me show you how it's done
Here at the school where the golden rule
Is to do unto others and run
I break water walls
