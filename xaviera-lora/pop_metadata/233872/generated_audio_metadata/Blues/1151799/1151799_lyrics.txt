Is he calm in the first place
Easy go, leaving no trace
Another chapter in a story that you've heard before
You come out in the fast lane
Living like you're leaving no pain
Feeling like a hero but I ain't so sure
Can't hold on to your heart mate
Time to go of your money
Things you need you still wear upon your soul
Reach your palm makes a difference
To how you view your existence
Don't be afraid to listen to your inner voice
Keep your faith, save yourself
Life is long
And sometimes hard
Living out
With truth in your heart
Slide along on a tightrope
Living life full of hope
Choose a path that leads you back to home
Gotta find your direction
Don't be fooled by deception
Only faith can show you where to go
Keep your faith
Save yourself
Keep your faith, save your soul
Keep your faith, save your soul
Keep your faith, save your soul
