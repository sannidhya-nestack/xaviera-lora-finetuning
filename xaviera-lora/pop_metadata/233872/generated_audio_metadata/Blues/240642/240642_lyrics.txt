Didn't I say to take it slow?
Didn't I say that you would go?
You didn't listen, you didn't want no white to say it
But I told you so
She had everything that you liked
But didn't I say she'd take a hike
You didn't listen, you didn't wanna know
I hate to say it but I told you so
Now me, I don't trust no one so I got no one to trust
Scratching my head and watching love affairs go bust
You know if you ask I'm gonna tell you the truth
You must've been nuts on this last one because she just dumped all over you
And didn't I say she'd break your heart
I think I said that from the start
Didn't wanna hear it
You didn't wanna know
I hate to say it
But I told you so
Now me, I don't have no one, so I got no one to lose
Like it a little better and I don't get so confused
You know if you ask, I'm gonna tell you the truth
You must've been nuts on this last one because she just dumped all over you
Hope you don't think I'm out of line
But I really think you've lost your mind
You're bound to recover, I just want you to know
I hate to say it, but I told you so
You never listen, you just don't know
I hate to say it, but I told you so
I hate to say it, but I told you So
I hate to say it, but I told you SO
