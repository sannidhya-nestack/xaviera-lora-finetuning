I don't sing because I'm happy
I'm happy'cause I sing
I don't sing because I'm happy
I'm happy because I sing
I was too poor to pay attention
Nobody learned me anything
It's been two years running
Since last I wrote a song
It's been two years running
Since last I wrote a song
My lady music left me
What in the world did I do wrong?
I get froze, frustrated, Lord, I don't know what to do
I get froze, frustrated, Lord, I just don't know what to do
So I beat on this guitar and I cry little blues
I've cried so many tears, now all my clothes are soaked
I've cried so many tears, all my clothes are soaked
But I'm feeling a little better, ever since my gibberish shitter broke
I don't sing because I'm happy
I'm happy'cause I sing
I don't sing because I'm happy, I'm happy'cause I sing
I may never write a song but I'm sure enough gonna sing
I don't sing because I'm happy, I'm happy'cause I sing
I don't sing because I'm happy
I'm happy'cause I sing
I may never write a song again
But I'm sure enough gonna sing
I don't sing because I'm happy
I'm happy'cause I sing
I don't sing because I'm happy, I'm happy'cause I sing
I may never write a song again but I'm sure enough gonna sing
I love to sing
I sure do
