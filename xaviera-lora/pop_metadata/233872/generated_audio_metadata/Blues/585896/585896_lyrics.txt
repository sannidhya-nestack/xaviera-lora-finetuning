The TV is flickering in the background
V holds a river of black and white
Dragging me through channels
Perfect worlds and guiding light
Jane's getting pretty in her uniform
While her cigarette is burning down
In the ashtray made of amber glass
Sad glass dressed in brown
But she's got green eyeshadow and red lips
Long dark hair and nice hips
Eyeshadow and the red lips
Long dark hair and the nice hips
The front porch is sagging, he don't give a damn
He's throwing furniture out the front door
And a hard rain's a common season of the flood
The Texas sky is opening up
But she's got green eyeshadow and red lips
Long dark hair and nice hips
Eye shadow and red lips
Long dark hair and nice hips
Green eye shadow and red lips
Long dark hair and nice hips
And a heart reads a comment, it's the season of the flood
The Texas sky is opening up
