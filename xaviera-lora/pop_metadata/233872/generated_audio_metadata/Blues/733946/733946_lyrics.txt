National Steel, that guy's playing
Full body sound, tricone is cool
National Steel, Steel, Steel, your strings are calling
Southern bound, gonna play those blues
Get on the boogie train
I'm taking away your national steel
You got me moving
Playing it loud
You're a shiny treat
National steel, steel, steel, true believer
In your beautiful sound
Let's get on our feet, on our feet, yeah
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Get on the boogie train
And take it away now
Get on the boogie train
And take it away
