Boss man calling for me, he says I'm late
Woman is calling for my head on a plate
Collectors calling me to pay the man
I said hey can't you see I'm doing the best I can
And every day's a Monday
Seems like every day's a Monday
Even Saturday and Sunday
Yeah, just give me the Monday blues
Stop by the corner joint to light my load
Ain't nothing wrong with a little nip for the road
It was Friday happy hour
The drinks were free
But I just went ahead and paid anyway
Cause there ain't no Friday for me
Every day's a Monday
Hey, hey, every day's a Monday
The eagle flies on Friday
And the vulture flies on Monday for me
Saint Peter called for me, Lord don't you know
He sent the grim reaper down for me, he said boy it's time to go
He reached out his long black hand to take me away
I said it's only Tuesday but come back in seven days
You're gonna have to take me on a Monday
Cause all I know is Monday
The eagle flies on Friday
And the raven flies on Monday for me
Every day, every day, every day's a Monday
