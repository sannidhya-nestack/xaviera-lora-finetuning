Some folks like'em short, others like'em tall
And some people like'em big, and some of us like'em small
So I'm gonna tell you why you can like them all
If they wiggle when they walk, if they move that a way
She's got a wiggle in her walk, she's got a swing and a sway
They say nobody's perfect but that's just a cliche
But you can wiggle that away
And some people like'em strong
Others like'em weak
Some folks like'em tough
Some of us like'em meek
I'm gonna tell you why you can like'em all
Seven days a week
If they wiggle when they walk
When they move their way
She's got a wiggle in her walk
She's got a swing and a sway
They say nobody's perfect but that's just a cliche
If you can wiggle that away
She's got a wiggle and a walk
When she moves that way
She's got a wiggle and a walk
It's a swing and a sway
They say nobody's perfect but that's just a cliche
If you wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle away
If you wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle away
They say nobody's perfect but that's just a cliche
