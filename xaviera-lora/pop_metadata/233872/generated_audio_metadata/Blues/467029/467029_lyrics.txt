Well, I'm just sitting, sitting all alone
Got my bag, got my guitar, I've got to carry on
I'm killing time, waiting for the buzz
Well, it's three weeks, hanging all around
Can't sleep, don't want to sleep alone
Mama, I'm coming home
Well, I've been sweeping down the alleys
I've been hanging in the parks
I've been taking local color
In the taverns after dark
Well, it's not the same, no, no
Not without you by my side, mmm
Well, it's three weeks hanging on the road
Can't sleep, don't wanna sleep alone
Mama, I'm coming home
Well, I've been swingin' down the alleys
I've been hangin' in the parks
I've been diggin' local color
In the taverns after dark
But it's not the same, no, no
Not without you by my side, mmm
Well, it's three weeks hangin' on the road
Can't sleep, don't wanna sleep alone
Mama, I'm comin' home, yeah
