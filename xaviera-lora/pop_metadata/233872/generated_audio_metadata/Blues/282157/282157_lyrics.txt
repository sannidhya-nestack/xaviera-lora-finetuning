Shake, shake, shake that, uh, shed and snake, uh
Slither and slide where my emotions like a fool
I can't hide'em
It's another bad dog fight
Another junkyard scrap, uh
Another bad dog fight
Yeah, I'm feeling the blues tonight
You know I got blindsided, ooh-ooh
I was going the wrong way down that one-way street
Another bad dog fight
You know I'm licking my wounds tonight
Well I, you know I give it my all
And throw myself up against that wall
I know that I cannot win but uh
Don't you try to stop me
I'm in another bad dog fight
Another bad dog fight
A real ugly dog fight
Yeah, I'm lickin' my wounds tonight
Bad, it was bad
Well you know I'd cry but I'd rather laugh
I'm down but I am not out
That's right you better get eyes in the back of your head baby
I learned a thing or thing or two
Be your turn for a bad dog fight
I want you up and in shape
Yeah, it's gonna be your turn, mm-hmm
I hope you feel as bad as I did that night
Oh yeah, baby
Hey, baby
Wow, it was just another big city scrap
Yeah, just another bad dog fight
Ooh, wild lord, feelin' the blues tonight
