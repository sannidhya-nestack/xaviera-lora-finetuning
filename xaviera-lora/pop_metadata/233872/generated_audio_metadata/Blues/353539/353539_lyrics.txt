Hear the train a-comin'
Rollin' round the bend
Hear the train a-comin'
Rollin' round the bend
Will it bring my baby
Bring her home again
Bring my baby back home
Bring her back to me
Bring my baby back home
Bring her home to me
This train done took my baby home
Where can she be?
Where is my baby
Where is my baby baby
Where is my baby
She's not on this train
She's not on this train
She's not on this train
Where is my baby? Where is my baby? Where is my baby?
She's not on this train
When's the next train comin'
Will it be on time
When's the next train comin'
Will it be on time
Will it bring my baby
Back into my life
