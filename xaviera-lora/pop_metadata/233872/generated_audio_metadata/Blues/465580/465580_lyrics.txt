Time's tough, I got no money, I got no home
Time's tough, I got no loving all alone
I can see the surprise by the look in your eyes
It's a handful of lies
Time's tough
Time's tough
Spend a nickel, spend it, die
Time's tough
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
I'm a friend in need of a friend indeed
Just remember to look baby but don't touch
Oh
Time's tough
I can't get no reaction, won't take no good advice
Whatever it is you're selling baby, you don't have to ask me twice
Time's tough
Time's tough, spend a nickel, spend it dime
Time's tough, show me yours and I'll show you mine
I'm a friend in need of a friend indeed
Just remember to look but don't touch baby
Ow, tab stuff
