He was a married man
But just my kind of man
I thought it'd be alright
If it was just one night
But when I got back home
He wouldn't leave me alone
He called me everyday
He said he loved my ways
He wants to change his life
He wants to leave his wife
Now honey that's not right
It was just for a night
I'm just a girl who's having fun
I don't wanna marry anyone (hey babe)
Me no ladies wanna criticize me (hey babe)
I just say no apologies, no apologies, no apologies
He was a wealthy man, a very handsome man
I thought it'd be alright if it was just one night
He wants to take me home, I'd rather live alone
He sent me flowers and gifts (a big bouquet)
He said he needed my kiss (every day)
He wants to take me on trips (let's fly away)
To taste my honey lips (what do you say?)
Just because he's got care (I got a lot to care)
He's still a pain in the ass
I'm just a girl who's having fun
I don't wanna marry anyone
I'm just a girl who's on the run
My sweet life is just too much fun
Baby, I'm just a girl who's having fun
Baby, I don't wanna marry anyone
Baby, me no
Ladies wanna criticize me (hey babe, hey babe)
I just say no apologies, no apologies, no apologies
