Hey buddy, how you doing?
Alright.
Well, I'll tell you.
I'm doing fine, I'm walking the line
I'm doing great, got me a hot date
So I gotta rock, I need to roll
Do what I need to do to keep my soul
Then I get the blue, go to the green
Pedal to the metal, I split this scene
Let's roll, everybody let's roll
Roll everybody, we got the blues on the run
Well, standing my ground, speaking my mind
Walking on the water, it's taking my time
Fire and ice, baby, water so sweet
Get up on the dance floor just to loosen my feet
I fear no evil it'll come and go
When we get to heaven gonna take it real slow
Right now we're hot tearing up the lot
Burning up the rubber we got plenty of that
Let's roll
Whoa, roll everybody, we got the blues on the run
Oh yeah, keep rolling buddy
Oh yeah, yeah, isn't that some of that old school
No, older, older
Give me that ancient rock
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about
Fools on the left, thieves on the right
And living on whiskey gonna drive all night
Fools on the left, thieves on the right
And living on whiskey gonna drive all night
Now I gotta run, no place to hide
Wrapping up the process for a midnight ride
We got fire and ice, make water so nice, it's sweet
Get up on the dance floor, gonna kick my feet
Some fear, no evil, it'll come and go
When I get to heaven, gonna take it real slow
Right now, we're hot
Tearin' up the lot
Burnin' up the rubber
We got plenty of that
Let's roll! Roll! Everybody let's roll!
Roll everybody
We got the blues on the run
Let's roll! That's right
That's right, keep it rolling buddy, keep it rolling
