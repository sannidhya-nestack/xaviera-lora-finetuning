Lost out on this hopey road
Gotta get you off my mind
The backseat holds all I need
Left the rest behind
Gotta get up, get out, get gone
You know it's cutting time
Rain on the windshield, wind twisting up the trees
The way you turned your back on me, brought me to my knees
Get up, get out, get gone, wash away those memories
Get up, get out, get gone
Take the highway out of town
I gotta put some miles on
Gotta put the pedal down
I don't care if I'm dead or alive, I don't care if I'm dead or alive
Get up, get out, get gone
Take the highway outta town
I gotta put some miles on
Gotta put the pedal down, yeah
The tires wearin' thin
And the needles hit me
The engine started smoking
I broke down in Tennessee
So I got up, got out, got gone
I'm gonna walk until I'm free
Walk till I'm free
I'm gonna walk until I'm free
