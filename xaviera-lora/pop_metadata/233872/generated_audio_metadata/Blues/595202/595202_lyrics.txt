Maybe the sun shines on you everyday
You got it all in a bag
Maybe your ship is sailing home
Waving the victory flag
But if you think it's all just a piece of cake
Let me be the first to say
That you're gonna find out, you're gonna find out
You're gonna find out, you're gonna find out
You're gonna find out the hard way
I once walked on water too, cock, shawl and bowl
I had the answer to everything, I really broke the mold
But then my luck went and ran on out, went from king to pawn in a day
And I found out, I found out, I found out
Man I found out, I sure found out the hard way
I hate to say I told you so
Not that it's come to pass
I hate to see you down and out
And running out of gas
But the sun don't shine on the same dog's rear
Every single day
Now that you found out, you found out, you found out, you found out
Yes, you found out the hard way
You found out, you found out, you found out
You found out
You found out the hard way
Everybody got a strong way to learn
Everybody got a page to turn
That's how you find out
You find out the hard way
