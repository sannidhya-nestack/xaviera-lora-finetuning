I heard you talking, heard what you said
I saw you laughing when I turned my head
So I'll keep walking, I'll just keep walking, walking away
I won't be waiting
For you to call
I won't be waiting for you at all
I'll just keep walking
there's nothing left to say
Don't bury me'neath an old willow tree
You wouldn't care anyway
I've got love to give
And I wanna live
As soon as these tears go away
And they will
Now listen sister
Hear what I say
If you don't love you
Just call it a day
And start walking
That's right, keep walking
Walking away
You hear song after song
How he done her wrong and she cried
She cried every night
Well, I've lived those lines too many times
This time I'm getting it right
Oh yeah, I won't be waiting
For you to call anymore
I won't be waiting for you at all
What for? I'll just keep walking
Keep walking, walking away
I'll just keep walking
Keep walking towards a brighter day
