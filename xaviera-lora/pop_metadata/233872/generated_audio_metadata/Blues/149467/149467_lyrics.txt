Just watching my time slip away
I was an innocent bastard under a love
But the judge don't believe a word I say
Some people call it a crime of passion
Oh, I call it more, more than I can stand
Some people call it a crime of passion
I call it more than I can stand
Came home from a hard day's work
Found my woman in the arms of another man
Hmm, no that's not it
Jury foreman stood up and said guilty
Judge said son, you have to pay
Jury foreman stood up and said guilty
Judd said, "Sama, you have to pay"
I looked up, said, "Judd, I've been paying all my life, tell me something new"
Seemed like living died just the same
