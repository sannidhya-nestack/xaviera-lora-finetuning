I never claimed to be, yeah, something like that
A polished personality, I ain't got
I've got my flaws, but my heart is good, yeah
So, baby, if I think in love, let it be understood
Baby, I'm a handful too hot to handle, yeah
Baby, I'm a handful too hot to handle
I might not paint things in a pretty scene
Yeah, but you don't have to guess about what I mean
My mood can swing from sunny to dark, yeah
One thing, baby, that I ain't is a walk in the park
Baby, I'm a handful, too hot to handle, yeah
Baby, I'm a handful, too hot to handle
I'm a handful of good times
I'm a handful of blues
Yeah, I'm a handful
In the wrong way that you choose
For all of the trouble
I may put you through
When it comes right down to the very end
I'll do right by you, well
If it's me, girl, you wanna be tight
Well, fasten your seatbelt, baby
Gonna be a bumpy ride
I may be a handful, yeah, but I hang on tight
To any lover, know that I have the feeling right
Well, I may be a handful, handful of good-lovin'
Maybe a handful, handful of huggin' and kissin', babe
I may be a handful, a handful of blues
Well, maybe a handful, yeah, too hot to handle
Maybe a handful, a handful for you
Or maybe a handful, too hot to handle
Yeah, yeah, yeah
