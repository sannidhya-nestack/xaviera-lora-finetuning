I don't know where I'm going
But I do know where I've been
When winds of change start blowing
Who knows what they'll bring
There may be sunshine, there may be rain
Heat wave or a hurricane
I'm no prophet but I've got memories of sunshine days
And pouring rain
I don't know where I'm going
But I do know where I've been
I don't know where I'm going
And this whole road seems so long
The seeds of love I've been sowing
Have all grown up and gone
Seems one day you're up
The next day you're down
One day you got a woman
And there's no one around
She'll tell you that she loves you
The next day she'll be gone
You can wake up smiling
And end up crying
I don't know where I'm going
But I do know where I've been
That's right
Seems one day you're up, the next day you're down
One day you've got a woman, then there's no one around
She'll tell you that she loves you, the next day she'll be gone
You can wake up smiling, then end up crying
I don't know where I'm going, but I do know where I've been
That's right
I don't know where I'm going
But I do know where I've been
Gonna say it again
I don't know where I'm going
But I do know where I've been
