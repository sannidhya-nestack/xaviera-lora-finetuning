Dear Santa Claus, give me a break
Dear Santa Claus, take me away
The rot and the loneliness is killing my brain
My life is ending in the gutter again
Sweet heavenly bliss
Sweet heavenly bliss
Dear Santa Claus, are you listening to me?
Are you for real or am I a fake?
This bottle of whiskey is my only friend
To kill the pain and the torment again
Sweet heavenly bliss
Sweet heavenly bliss
