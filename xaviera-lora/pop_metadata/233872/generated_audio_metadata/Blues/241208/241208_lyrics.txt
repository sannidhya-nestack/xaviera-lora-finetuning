Your motor's running, you're flashing your cash
You're all revved up and you're talking trash
You're waving your Rolex in her face
Ain't gonna get you any place
Coast on, boys, talk that trash
Coast on, boys, have some class
Coast on, boys, don't let your motor overheat
Oh, take my advice, you're trying too hard
Like a yapping dog tied up in the yard
You're looking at her like a piece of meat
That ain't gonna sweep her off her feet
Coast on boys, talk that trash
Coast on boys, have some class
Horse don't boast, don't let your motive overheat
Take your mouth out of gear, let your engine cool
Pay attention to her, be a listening fool
Let the talk coast, try not to drool
Just remember this golden rule
Coast don't boast, chalk that trash
Coast don't boast, have some class
Coast don't boast, don't let your motor overheat
Flexing your muscle in your arm
It ain't gonna give you any time
But when you're holding the cause of the body
It ain't gonna get you very far
Coast on boasts
Talk that trash
Coast on boasts
Have some class
Close those bolts and let your motor overheat
