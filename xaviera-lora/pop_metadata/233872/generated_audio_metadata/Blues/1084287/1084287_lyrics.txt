I'm a dark cloud and it's plain to see
I ain't got nobody and no one's got me
I pray all day long for her and not to home
But I'm getting nothing, nothing but old
I asked my brother, what's the secret to love
I asked my mother, pray to God above
And tell the angels my faith is running lean
I loved a woman, she didn't love me
Won't you take my body and you lay it down
I could not lose what was never found
And the sins of my father they're gonna end with me
I loved a woman
And she didn't love me
Yeah, I loved that woman
And she didn't love me
Yeah, I loved that woman
And she didn't love me
