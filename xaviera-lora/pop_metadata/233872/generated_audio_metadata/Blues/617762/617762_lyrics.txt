You were on my mind baby
Saw you on my lips too
Now we weren't on earth baby
We was on sugar moon
What you thinking baby
How'd I get all soft and blue
Getting lost in the middle of nowhere
We were on sugar moon yeah
I got a one way ticket baby
I'm off to realize my dues
I'm on a climb to reject you
I'm off to sugar moon
I'm on fire for you honey
I'm waiting for you
Give me lots of loving and I'll
Wear it on sugar moon yeah
Rumblin' tumblin' down the crowded avenue
Or somethin' about your touch
And a shuffle just for you
Maybe life would be a little sweeter too
If we shared that mighty lovely
Tasty sugar moon
Who you? Life would be for you
Sweet on sugar moon yeah
More sugar moon yeah
Sweet on sweet on sugar moon yeah
