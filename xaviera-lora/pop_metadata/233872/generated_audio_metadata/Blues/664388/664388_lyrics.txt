Nobody wants you
I said nobody wants you
No, nobody wants you, baby
Like I do
And nobody's gonna miss you
I said nobody's gonna miss you
No nobody's gonna miss you baby
The way I do
And nobody cares about you
I said nobody cares about you
No nobody cares about you baby
As much as I do
And nobody loves you
I said nobody loves you
No nobody loves you baby
I said nobody loves you
No nobody loves you
Like I love you
