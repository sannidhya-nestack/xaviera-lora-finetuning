Pulled out on that highway
I just started in south
I don't know where I'm going
I'm just trying to find a little peace in myself
Around every bend I take
The lights keep flashing gold
I think somebody's trying to tell me something
And all I see is the road
I'm on the drive to get home
I'm on the drive to get home
Oh yeah
I pulled into a little town
Had a gas station
I just gave him a hand of money
I can't remember his face
'Cause I'm on the drive again
I'm on the drive again
When I find myself
On the right side of the wall
I'm gonna let all the fear pass me in the left lane
With my highs and a bottle of champagne
I'm gonna dance
I dance in the hood of my car, I dance in the hood of my car, baby
I'm on the drive again
I'm on the drive again, oh yeah
Day and night and day and day
