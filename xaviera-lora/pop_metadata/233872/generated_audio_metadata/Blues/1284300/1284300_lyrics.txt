Rollin' down the highway, chasin' down the sun
Rollin' down the highway, chasin down the sun
Gotta hop on the trouble, and I'm on the run
Decently smiles
They call my name
He said, "Let's mouse"
They call my name
Searching for freedom in this winding game
Late night whispers, moon dancing on the lake
Late night whispers, moon dancing on the lake
Every mile behind me
Every choice I make
Lonesome guitar singing to the stars
Lonesome guitar singing to the stars
Riding this journey with my old stars
These endless miles, they call my name
These endless miles, they call my name
Searching for freedom in this wild and game
Dust on my boots, put fire in my stride
Dust all my boots with fire in my stride
Keep on moving forward, leaving nothing to hide
Rising sun's promise, breaking through the grave
Rising sun's promise, breaking through the grave
Every step I take, it's a brand new day
These endless miles to call my name
These endless miles
