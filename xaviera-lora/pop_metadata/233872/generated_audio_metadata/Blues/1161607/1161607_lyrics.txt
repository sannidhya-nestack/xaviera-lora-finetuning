Sitting on the back porch on a day so fine
Listening to the birdies and drinking cheap red wine
They say God is in his heaven, I know I'm sure in mine
Just look at all those berries getting juicy on the vine
Easy pickin' fruit, give me that easy pickin' fruit
Just put that peach within my reach
Down on those lower branches
Easy pickin' fruit, I love that easy pickin' fruit
If I have to climb to make it mine
It's not worth takin' chances
Sittin' on the back porch, thinkin' of last night
Somethin'bout your kisses works up my appetite
Oh, keep it sweet and easy, babe, you're just my type
I know you'll make me happy when the time is right
Easy pickin' fruit
I'm talkin' easy pickin' fruit
Just put that peach within my reach
Down on those lower branches
Easy pickin' fruit
I love that easy pickin' fruit
If I have to climb to make it mine
It's not worth takin' chances
Easy picking fruit
Easy picking fruit
Put that peach within my reach
Down on those lower branches
Easy picking fruit
I love that easy pickin' fruit
If I have to climb to make it mine
It's not worth takin' chances
If I have to climb to make it mine
Well, ooh, maybe I'll take a little chance
