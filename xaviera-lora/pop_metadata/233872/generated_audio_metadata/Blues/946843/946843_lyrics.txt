My baby's back in town
She got me sneaking around
My baby's back in town
She got me sneaking around
Yeah I meet her at the station in the light of day
That I don't see familiar faces for that I must hope and pray
Go to a nearby cafe so I can kiss and hold her tight
There was a booth in the back seat
Apart from any lunch and my babies back in town
She's got me sneaking around
Yeah she does
My baby's back in town
She's got me sneaking'round
Yeah she does
Yeah this danger out there
Could find me on any street
They say hell's paradise
When two lovers are in here
I drop into a taxi
Keep my head down low
Where we going this time
Only my baby knows
Standing on the corner
Waiting for the keys
I don't think my nerves could handle
Too many days like these
Yeah my baby's back in town
She's got me sneaking around
Laying on my shoulder
My baby's back in town
She got me sneaking around
I try to melt away
But I stand out in a crowd
That's what they tell me
Try not to attract attention
Baby don't you talk so loud
I'm finally up in her room, it's just me and her
You better close the shutters, babe, you better bolt the door
if she ever found me here with you making time
You can rest assured my life won't be worth a dime
Yeah, my baby's back in town, she's got me sneaking round
I'll tell ya
My baby's back in town, she's got me sneaking around
Yeah, there's danger out there, could find me on any street
This city has priors
When daily life is all in heat
So let me tell
My baby's back in town
And I am sneaking around, around, around
My baby's back in town
And I am sneaking around
She's got me sneaking around
