Well, I'm rollin' on the bathroom roof, got the radio playin'
Some preacher man sayin' how they all get lost
Feel like I'm wearing some other guy's shoes
I'm lost and confused and I'm all turned around
Travelling down that yellow moon in a state
Feel like I got lost in your eyes
But it's in the twilight hours that a man could think
And I'm thinking about the life that I've lived
And I'm thinking there's a detour up ahead
Ridin' on that yellow moon, on that yellow moon, on that yellow moon interstate
Yeah, I'm burnin' diesel fumes from Hit-A-Mobile
Sitting there behind the mirror and I'm just covering ground
It's always been my routine so simple and clear
My whole world's here now I'm all turned around
Well, I'm traveling down that yellow moon and I stay
Feel like I got lost in your eyes
But it's in the twilight hours that a man could think
And I'm thinking'bout the life that I've led
And I'm thinking there's a future up ahead
Ridin' on that yellow moon
On that yellow moon
On that yellow moon real estate
Truck drivin' main
Eighteen wheels a-rollin'
All the way down our chin
Yeah, I've never been the kind of man to change my ways
Spend all my days in something newly planned
Well, the road was always friendly
Once it used to send me
To another place that I couldn't understand
Don't you know I'm traveling down that yellow moon in our state
Somehow I got lost in your eyes
In the twilight hours, here's a man can think
As I'm thinking about the life that I live
And I'm thinking there's a deep chill up ahead
Riding on that yellow moon, on that yellow moon, on that yellow moon, yellow moon
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 18 wheels, oh yeah
Ridin' on that yellow moon
Well, I've been in the middle of my own
Yellow moon, I say
18 wheels rollin'
Yellow moon, rollin'
Yellow moon, since we're rollin'
Yeah, I'm just a-coverin' the moon (Ridin' on that yellow moon, on that yellow moon, on that yellow moon, I'll stay)
Highway, ridin' on that yellow moon, on that yellow moon, on that yellow moon high
I'm on my way
