Hey baby, why you being so nice to me?
If you want my respect
You better get down on your knees and say please
I never paid for love, never paid for love
I sure paid my dues
You see I spend my time
Dodging bad boys just like you
Just like you
I'm suspicious every day
I'm suspicious in every kind of way
I'm suspicious every day
I'm suspicious
I'm suspicious of you, yeah, yeah
Hey baby
You got to give me what I expect
all I ask from you
It's just a little respect
you see my man trust in days
Have all come to an end
Come to an end
Think you're gonna be my lover
Oh oh oh
Well first you got to be my friend
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm suspicious every day
I'm suspicious in every kinda way
I'm suspicious every day
I'm suspicious, I'm suspicious
Over you
I don't trust you baby
I don't trust nobody
Now hey baby
It's gonna be straight from me to you
Now listen up
I don't mean to be mean, darling, no, no
But I gotta do what I gotta do
And what's that you say?
You don't like me anymore
So boy you try to steal my joy
Oh boy
Oh maybe you're right
Maybe you're right
I'm just a little paranoid
Just a little paranoid
Hey yeah
I'm suspicious (suspicious)
Every day
I'm suspicious in every kind of way
I'm suspicious every day
I'm suspicious
I'm suspicious every day
I'm suspicious in every kind of way
I'm suspicious every day
Lord, I'm suspicious
