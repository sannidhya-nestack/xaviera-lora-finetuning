Oh daddy, daddy
Why'd you go upside my head
Oh daddy, daddy
Why'd you go upside my head
And etched into my heart
Is every cruel word you said
Oh daddy, daddy
Why'd you leave me all alone?
Oh daddy, daddy
Why'd you leave me all alone?
Did you go out looking for a daddy of your own?
Oh daddy daddy what I wanted you to do
Oh daddy daddy what I wanted you to do
Was to love me the way
Was to love me the way I'm hating you
