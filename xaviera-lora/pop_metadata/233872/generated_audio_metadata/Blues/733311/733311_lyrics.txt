Well, I'm working hard, sun beating down
Long road to home on a hard baked ground
When the day is done
I go to drinking at the still on my way home
Sometime, devil on my back
Whiskey on my breath, bag at the shack
My woman holler, where's some dollar?
Mississippi blues don't feed us tomorrow
I don't need no Mississippi blues
Don't give me no Mississippi blues
I don't want your Mississippi blues
Don't need those Mississippi blues (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
She said, "Come on baby, just toe the line"
I come home sober than just one time
We got the children running around
I need a dollar, feed'em now
You're standing there in your dead man's shoes
Preaching'bout those Mississippi blues
No Mississippi blues
I don't need no Mississippi blues
I don't want your Mississippi blues
I don't need those Mississippi blues
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She said you've been out for far too long
I can smell that dollar's gone
You're standing there in your dead man's shoes
Preaching'bout those Mississippi blues
No need, no Mississippi blues
I don't want your Mississippi blues
Don't give me no Mississippi blues
I don't need no Mississippi blues
I got'em sober as the old judge
Handed my dollar without no grudge
A woman said, "Baby, you're doing fine"
Gotta make sure you don't toe the line
Raisin' children got a long way to go
It sure as hell seems a long, long road to hoe
Yeah, yeah, my Mississippi blues
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mississippi blues
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh my, oh my, my Mississippi blues
Preaching about those Mississippi blues
