Heat seeker
Lying in the dust by the side of the road
A true believer
Left it there to rust, so to lighten his load
That you put on his back, since the day he was born
So sad to be so young, and to look so worn
Figured it out, when he looked in your eyes
That you hid it from him, but he's finally realized it
You would never do, what you want him to do
You would never go to the places he's been sent to
You would never put yourself in harm's way
So he's let it all go, said it's his final day
He's come to ask you why
For you to be home somebody else is to die
Somebody say what's going on around here
Lots of money to make if you're rabid in fear
Wonder if there was a time way back
When the future would seem to be less black
Come with me, I have something to say
Will it be too late if I tell you today
Quoting God to make it seem alright
To blow the hell out of your country in the middle of the night
They will never be what they want you to be
They will never see what you're trying to see
They want to control everything that you do
But nothing that they say ever seems to be true
I would try to ease this pain
But it's out of control
Just like the runaway train
Sorting it out couldn't be too hard
If we try it today before it's gone too far

Leave it there to rust, leave it there to rot, yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
