Too many thoughts running through my head
You will have to excuse me
For all the bad things I did
Lie after lie
Coming from these lips
Like a fool I kept cheating
All those secrets I hid
I took the long way home
Away from all temptation
But it's a slow road, a slow road to redemption
Time after time I always let you down
I'm weakened and feeble
I was never around
Down on my knees
Release me from my sins
Now life is a battle
That I'm trying to win
A long way home, away from all temptation
But it's a slow road, a slow road to redemption
I took the long way home
Away from all temptation
But it's a slow road
A slow road to redemption
There's still a long way to go
To find the right direction
But it's a slow road
A slow road to redemption
