Sweet pea, hey what's going on baby
Sweet pea, don't tell me maybe
I'll make you breakfast in the morning
I'll make you dinner at night
Sweet pea, hey what's going on baby
Sweet pea, don't tell me maybe
I'll be your hip shaking mama
I'll make everything real nice
And when you go out on the town
I hope you think about me
When you dream about what you want
I hope you dream about me
Sweet pea, yeah you're driving me crazy
And when you go out on the town
I hope you think about me
When you dream about what you want
I hope you dream about me
Sweet pea, oh you're driving me crazy
Sweet pea, why don't we get married?
Sweet pea
Yeah, you're just right for me
I'll be your hip shaking mama
I'll make everything real nice
