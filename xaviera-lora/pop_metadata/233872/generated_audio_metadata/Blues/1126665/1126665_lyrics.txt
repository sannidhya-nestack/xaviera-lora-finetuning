When the bang, bang, bang in my head starts
And my skin begins to crawl
When the darkness cloaks its blanket
And the devil hears my call
Senses now returning
Searing pain brings torture back
Is there really any choice here
Only one thing that I lack
Oh, pure white snow
Give me some relief
Sell me some heaven
Give me no grief
When that stinging needle's here
I see the face of God appear
Oh, do your thing
Snow white pure
Do your thing, pure white snow
Snow white pure
Grant me some peace
Calve out the mystery of this bondage beast
In the horror of this life
Inject me with your deadly knife
Oh, do your thing
Pure white snow
Do your thing
Snow white pure
Wow!
Pure white snow, you have your way
You've come to rule my life each and every day after day
And this bargain has no end'til the devil says again
Time for more
Pure white snow, snow white pure
Do your thing
Pure white snow, just do your thing
We don't need a copper, mm-mm, mm-mm
Cold and mean
I just make a call to the man
To do your thing
Pure white snow
