Used to be, I played this thing all the time
I'd have nothing but
Stevie Ray and Jimmy on my mind
If you're looking down on me
Would you say something kind
Have I got this right?
If I don't, I hope that sends some sign
Now it seems I can't get back to what I had
I can't remember why I started
But it's never been that bad
Searching for that perfect line
Makes it all worthwhile
I'd like to make old Roy Buchanan
Danny Gatton raise a smile
