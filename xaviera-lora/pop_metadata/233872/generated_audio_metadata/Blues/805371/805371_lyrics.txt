She walks downtown with a red dress on
Late at night with her mind half gone
Come the morning she hides her face
And the lines of shame time can't replace
Name was Memphis born in Albany
The prettiest girl Tommy ever had seen
Yeah Tommy loved Memphis and his love was strong
Even loved her late at night with her mind half gone
Cry Memphis
Tommy bought Memphis a wedding band
He cried, "Let me be your one and only man"
I love you, Memphis, with a love so blind (love so blind)
I'm begging you to leave that world behind
Memphis cried, "Tommy, now don't you know?"
You can't make love with a heart of stone
Time will pass and then you'll see
I'm not the woman that you want me to be
No, I'm not the woman that you want me to be
And he cried, "Memphis, please come home"
And he cried, "Meth-us, don't leave me alone, no"
Tommy fell down on his knees as Memphis jumped into that white limousine
One last look is all she gave and he knew he'd never see Memphis again
And he cried, "Memphis, please come home"
And he cried Macbeth
Don't leave me alone, no
And he cried Macbeth
Please come home
And he cried Memphis
Don't leave me alone, no
Cried Memphis
Cried Memphis
Crying in tears, crying in tears
