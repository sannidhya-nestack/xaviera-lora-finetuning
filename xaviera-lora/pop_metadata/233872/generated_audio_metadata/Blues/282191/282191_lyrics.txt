Talkin' heads are talkin'
I hear those lion sound bites
They say they'll stay the course
you know they've seen the light
They think they're pretty slick
Those fat cat chicken hocks
But it's always someone else's diet
They never walk the walk
And out in the real world hard times are here today
Getting put out on the street
It's a paycheck away
Driving to the gas pump
Price goes up and up
Guess those good old oil boys really need the bucks
Surely does seem shady
Sure does seem corrupt
They'll probably start another war
And let your grandkids pony up
And out in the real world hard times are here today
Getting put out on the street
It's a paycheck away
It's a paycheck away, just a paycheck away
Hear me now people, hear what I say
Out in the real world hard times are here today
Getting put out on the street, it's a paycheck away
Now those slime dogs at Enron, yeah they did get booked
But the more that type steals, the more they get let off the hook
We're going to jail, we scam a lousy dollar
But corporate crooks run free, cause their crimes are big and white collar
And out in the real world our times are here today
Getting put out on the street, it's a paycheck away
Pontificating politicians, most of them are bought
While everything around us continues to slowly rot
But don't you worry baby, president says it's all fine
They ain't levers you hear breaking
Just angels singing in your mind
That odd in the real world hard times are here today
Getting put out on the street, it's a paycheck away
It's a paycheck away, just a paycheck away
Hear me now people, hear what I say
Out in the real world hard times are here today
Getting put out on the street
It's a paycheck away
It's a paycheck away, just a paycheck away
Hear me now people, hear what I say
Out in the real world hard times are here today
Getting put out on the street
It's just a paycheck away
