Little dance joint on the outskirts of town
Looked like a place to throw a few down
Texas hold'em in neon lights
Told me I was in for a hell of a night
I stepped on in and the first thing I saw
Was a topless lady dancing on the bar
Waitress said as she gave me a wink
Are you here to gamble or to drink?
I said I wanna wet my whistle
Or wage her some money
She smiled at me said come closer honey
She whispered something but all I could hear was
Liquor in the front and poker in the rear
Hold on my friend, could you say that again?
I might have misheard just a couple of words
Let me get this perfectly clear
Liquor in the front, poker in the rear
I thought to myself that this can't be
I found a hole in the wall as wild as me
I should have read that little sign
Saying three feet back from the yellow line
Next thing I knew I was hit by a chair
Saw a fist full of dollars flying in the air
Amazing enough I didn't spill my beer
Cause there's liquor in the front and poker in the rear
Hold on my friend, could you say that again?
I might have misheard just a couple of words
Let me get this perfectly clear
Liquor in the front and poker in the rear
All this double talk has got me confused
Got me thinking I've been drinking too much booze
Next time I go out gotta clean out my ears
I heard liquor in the front and poker in the rear
Hold on my friend, could you say that again
I might have misheard just a couple of words
Let me get this perfectly clear
Liquor in the front, poker in the rear
