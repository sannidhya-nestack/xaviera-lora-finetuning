I used to drive a sporty Lexus
I owned a mansion in Dallas, Texas
I had a woman who shared my name
She took everything but the blame
Had millions of dollars in a foreign bank
Rubies and diamonds made Queen Elizabeth faint
That woman of mine could play the mean game
She took everything but the blame
She took it all, but the clothes on my back
If she could, I know she would take that (if she would)
She took everything but the blame
I had a family owned business for twenty years
It was built from the ground up
I was a man to be feared
She was the first in line to stake her claim
She took everything but the blame
She took it all, but the clothes on my back
And if she could, I know she would take that
She took everything but the blame
She took everything but the blame
She took everything that is but the blame
Help me somebody, help me, yeah
