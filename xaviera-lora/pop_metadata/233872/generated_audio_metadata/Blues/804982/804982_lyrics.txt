There's a war going on outside
There's a fight for survival
A fight for the right to be heard
Be heard
There's a war
Raging outside
There's a struggle for change
A movement to challenge the norm
So don't hold the light
Don't hold the light
Don't hold the light
We gonna need it for long
There's a war going on inside
There's a hunger for justice
Temptation to pick up the sword
There's a war raging inside
In the air you can feel it
Everyone wants an equal shout out
Shout out
So don't hoard the light
Don't hoard the light
Don't hoard the light
We gonna need it for long
War, yes, a war (war)
War raging in my heart
Fighting for what is lost
Love, come take me, war (war)
War raging in my heart
Fighting for what is lost
Love come take me, war (war)
War raging in my heart
Fighting for what is lost
Love come take me, war (war)
War raging in my heart
Fighting for what is lost
Love come take me
War
Oh, oh, oh, oh
