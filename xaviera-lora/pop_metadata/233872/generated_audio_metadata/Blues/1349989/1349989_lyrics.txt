Mississippi's on fire
Civil unrest on the streets
Mississippi's burning
No place for harmony
It's time to get down
There's no room in town
They're gonna burn it down
Mississippi is on fire
People living separate lives
And the system is broken
When you can't see your own front line
They say another land
Don't want you around
They're gonna burn you down
Right down
Mississippi is on fire
There is nowhere left to run
And the tension gets hotter
In the heat of the midday sun
It's time to run away
This will last, can't stay
Hope for change will come someday
