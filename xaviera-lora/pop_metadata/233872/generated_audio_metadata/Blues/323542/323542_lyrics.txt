You know my mama told me, my daddy told me too
Well if you don't change your way there's a jail cell waiting for you
You know I didn't listen, didn't think they knew shit from shine
But here I sit in this room of steel that measures nine by nine
I got no one to blame, no one to blame but myself
Left home when I was sixteen, I was New Orleans bound
I landed in that crescent city where trouble can be found
You know it didn't take long, the law came looking for me
They wanted to know about some dead man up old Mason street
I got no one to blame, no one to blame but myself
Well, you know, my mama told me, my daddy told me too
Well, if you don't wanna change your way, there's a jail cell waiting for you
You know I didn't listen, didn't think they knew shit from shine
Well, here I sit in this room of steel that measures nine by nine
I got no one to blame, no one to blame but myself
No I got no one to blame, no one to blame but myself
Yes I got no one to blame, no one to blame but myself
