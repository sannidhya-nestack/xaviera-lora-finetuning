He was sold down the river
And betrayed by a man he thought was a friend
Now he sits in the corner
Pours a drink
Tells a story that just won't end
All night long
He sets the mood
Carries on
In the name of the blues
In the name of the blues
It was one cold December
And the year may be sixty-nine
When that fool stole his woman, took the dream
The wounds haven't healed with time
There was no plan, no welcome news
So we made a stand
In the name of the blues
In the name of the blues
Play those blues
(Sigh)
In the heat of the sunshine
Plays a song
The lyrics I've heard before
And the sound of his guitar
Screams so loud
Emotion in every chord
I watch the way those six strings move
As he plays in the name of the blues
Of the drink
To find the truth
He will sing in the name of the blues
In the name of the blues
In the name of the blues
In the name of the blues
In the name of the blues
