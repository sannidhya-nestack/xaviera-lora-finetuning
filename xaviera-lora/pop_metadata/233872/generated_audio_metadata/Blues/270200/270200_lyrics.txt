There is someone
I've been thinking of night and day
I never knew one
That could make me
Feel this way
And what I'm feeling
Is something so new to me
I keep thinking any minute
I wake up and find it's all a dream
She's with me
But if she's with me
You better keep your distance from now on
she's with me
I don't worry
By them other men hanging'round her door
She sends them all away
I'm the man that she's waited for
And when the night comes
And the moon and stars are all you see
I got a satisfied mind
I know that she will stand by me
She's with me
But if she's with me
You'd better keep your distance from now on
she's with me
Well I don't have to scream and shout
Throw my weight around
Cause every place I go
The word is out
They got the news
They got the news
All over my hometown
She's with me
Buddy she's with me
You better keep your distance from now on
she's with me
Well, I don't have to scream or shout
Or throw my weight around
every place I go
The word is out
They got the news
They got the news
All over my hometown
She's with me
Buddy she's with me
You'd better keep your distance from now on
You'd better keep your distance from now on
Better keep your distance from now on
Cause she's with me
