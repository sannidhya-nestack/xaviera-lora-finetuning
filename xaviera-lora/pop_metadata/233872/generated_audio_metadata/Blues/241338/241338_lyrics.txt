Baby, one, just one look from you
I can tell you're the best
Baby one
Just one kiss from you
Got me dreaming'bout the rest
When the morning comes a calling
I want you by my side
And in the evening, I'll be dreaming
And I will not breathe tonight
Baby, won't
Just one touch from you
I wanna stay by your side
Baby one
Just one night with you
I know we'll both be satisfied
If you're thinking I'll be leaving
When I get what I want
I'm for real and what I feel is
You're the one that I want
If you're thinking I'll be leaving
When I get what I want
I'm for real and what I feel is
You're the one that I want
