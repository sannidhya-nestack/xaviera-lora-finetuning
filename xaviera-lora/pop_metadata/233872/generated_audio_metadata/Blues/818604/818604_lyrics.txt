Well remind me what I came here for
Well, it's ruined many a good man, but the time before I got the same
I got the same old blues
I've been moving all my life now
And I just can't seem to be satisfied
I got the same, I got the same old blues
I got the same old blues, yeah
And don't you dare complain that I see sixteen, oh no
Well I got my blues and he got his
We got the same
We got the same old blues now
But try and try as I may
Just can't drive these old blues away
Yes I got the same old blues
But try and try as I may
Just can't drive these old blues away
Yes, I got the same old blues, alright
Yes, and sometimes I get too drunk to blame
Down in Butler Town and the people walk by like I got nothing to say
I got the same, I got the same old blues
They say rolling stone don't gather no moss
But I'm riddled with the blues and I'm counting the cost
I got the same, I got the same old blues now
Well, I'll try and try as I may
Just can't drive these old blues away
I got the same old blues
But try and try as I may
Just can't drive these old blues away
I got the same old blues
I got the same old blues now
Well, I got the same old blues, yeah, alright
