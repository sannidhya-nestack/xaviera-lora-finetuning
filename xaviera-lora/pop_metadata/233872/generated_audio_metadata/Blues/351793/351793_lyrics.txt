Take a look at these graveyard hands
I've been scooping my bags since before I could stand
Keeping headstones clean and crypt flowers fresh
And shoveling up the remains is giving out my flesh
My time of seed, my share of ghosts
Betchless souls lost at sea, float between the coasts
But it's like they couldn't duck water, same as electricity
But I've never had so many walk up to me
All the souls rose up and the floods went down
Like scooters from a drain swamp around
But this last storm blew in a pestilence
Now there's predators in among the penitents
And when nightfall comes these darker shades
Move across the deep like swarms black prey
As they get large numbers with each expedition
These suckers hate competition
So pour the wine on the graves and toss the bottles in the lake
Some to mourn some to honor and some to lie, babes
My child keeps on being fed
Cause everything I've ever loved is dead
'Cause everything I've ever loved is dead
Don't it look like Luther's panning for gold
Over at Lafayette and Camp without O'Connor to bold
He's been fishing for crawdads since he almost drowned
Now he's pale as palm fronds and can't keep nothing down
His pupils fixin' on their own wet design
At the end of Thysinet names of the passersby
But in a tooth and beer, cares all he ever finds
And those strange fish that smell like blood and brine
And also muscles and a garlic press
Several thumbs and pieces for playing chess
A woman's leg still snugly in his shoe
And a mess of pots for stew
A couple hundred girls is ghosting with the bottles of Renault
Dumped near Juarez, Mexico
They made their way up here with stunned regard
Holding pristine luxury cars
Oh, wild rays and tons of bottles in the lake
And some of them look hardly even after they've just dazed
The ones who lick their lips and stare
Now everything I've ever loved is dead
Now everything I used to love is dead
Take a look at this wine soaked sand
We've been tearing up the soil since Cain raised a hand
I sleep on top of the vault to keep dry at night
While air force one passes by like a good Levite
Sometimes they kill you for your blood or your stuff
Sometimes they make you feel guilty for not dying fast enough
Sometimes they just leave you alone so you can call it assault
But when you're sinking under the breakers it's the same result
And to prove my point here come on more pilgrims on coffin ships from Black 47
Lost in trance and whole families mislaid thin like a set of Karas blades
But I didn't spend my whole life burying them right
Just to watch them dick themselves up every night
And besides who needs a caretaker around this whole damn town is a graveyard now
And I guess before I go well
All the wild old graves are tossed about to the side
It's just you and me Lord holding back the tide
It's my last super-read
The only thing I'll ever love to death
The only thing I'll ever love to death is death
