Yeah, yeah, yeah
I send this message out to everyone
From Tennessee straight out to California
You screw me once we will be over and done
At least you can't complain that I didn't warn ya
I've had my fill of people bringing me down
You know I've had my share of thieves and liars
I'd rather spend my days with no one around
To waste them all with losers who can't inspire
Don't bring your BS my way
Hope you hear me when I say
Shut up! You really ought to save your breath
Get out! You really ought to save your breath
We got nothing next
So if you're thinking about apologizing to me
Save your breath
You get the picture, have I made myself clear?
I have no interest in your false assertions
Why don't you act your age and grow up my dear?
Or everyone you meet will soon desert you
Don't bring your BS my way
Hope you hear me when I say
Shut up!
You really ought to save your breath
Get out, you really ought to save your breath
We got nothing left
So if you're thinking'bout apologizing to me
Save your breath, shut up
You really ought to save your breath
Get out, you really ought to save your breath
We got nothing left
So if you're thinking'bout apologizing to me
Save your breath
