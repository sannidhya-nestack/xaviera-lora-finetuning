I gotta stop thinking'bout you
I gotta stop pretending that you love me too
I gotta turn over a brand new leaf
I gotta stop crying in my sleep
I gotta stop living in the past
I gotta stop wondering if our love would last
I gotta stop talking, start back rocking
I gotta stop thinking'bout you
I gotta focus on the road ahead
I gotta
And get you out of my head
I gotta stop worrying about things I can't change
Like the way you left me standing in the rain
I gotta put it all behind my back
And bless what I own, ive what I lack
I gotta find myself in all of this mess
I gotta stop thinking'bout you
I got all these spiders crawling in my brain
I need a little more juice to cure my pain
I'll plug up my boat, catch a leak in my float
Before I start sinking again
I gotta stop living in the past
There's just too many women for that
Now I paid my dues
I'll start losing these blues
I gotta stop thinking'bout you
I gotta all these spiders in my brain
I need a little more juice for my pain
Plug up my boat
Patch up my float
Before I start sinking again
Yeah, I gotta stop living in the past
And just the too many women for that
I gotta find myself
And all of this mess
I gotta stop thinking bout you
Stop thinking'bout you
I gotta stop thinking'bout you
Stop thinking'bout you
I gotta stop thinking'bout you
Gotta stop thinking'bout you
I gotta stop thinking'bout you
I gotta stop thinking'bout
