You know, I used to have this reoccurring nightmare
Where I would wake up in this medieval land
With this big old black crumbled castle in the back of me
And everything, of course there was a moat
Everything on my side of the moat was in black and white
Except this one colored television that was broken and wouldn't give me the picture, you know
But over, over on the other side of the moat
Was this beautiful place
I'm telling you it was blue grass
And orange trees and purple pink flamingos flying through
An unbelievable sky
And I knew that was the place for me
But I had one very big problem
In that moat was this big ugly green alligator with red eyes and he was
And he dug down deep in the mud
He could not be fooled for money and not for love
Yeah there was a man eating alligator
Swimming around in the moat
And he was just waiting for me to try
Yeah he was waiting
For me to try
To get on to the other side
Get on to the other side
Oh yeah
So I used to just sit and sulk
Thinking about all the things that I couldn't have that were on the other side of the moat
Well that man eating alligator swam from side to side
Yeah it didn't matter what I said or how hard I cried
He was just waiting for me to try
Get on over to the other side
Yeah get to the other side
That's what I wanted to get on over to the other side
So I started, I started making my plans
Mmm, making my plans
I said, "Mr. Alligator, why don't you want to go over to the other side
Where there's lots more people, lots more things to eat up and be excited about?"
And then I would twiddle my toes on top of the water
Snap, snap, ow, ow, ow, ow, oh, man, he was so fast
Ooh, yeah, I just didn't think he was gonna let me try
I didn't wanna, I didn't wanna be wearing alligator boots and alligator purse
I had a feeling he was gonna be wearing me on the inside
Swimming around in the mo'
Yeah, just swimming around in the mo'
That man-eating alligator
Couldn't be fooled
Not for money, not for love
Ooh, man-eating alligator, swimming around
