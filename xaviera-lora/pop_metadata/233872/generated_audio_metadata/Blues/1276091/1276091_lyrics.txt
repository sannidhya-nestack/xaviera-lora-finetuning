My love's a wildfire based out of control
Igniting desire deep down in your soul
There's a big risk getting close to me
I'll turn you to ashes then just leave you be
There's danger when we're together
Volatile as a ton of TNT
Think it's best if you just stay far away from me
Sign loves the powder
Can't waitin' to blow
Leaving destruction everywhere I go
Here's a warning in case you're confused
You don't wanna light my slow burning fuse
There's a real danger when we're together
We're as volatile as a ton of TNT
I think it's better if you just stay far away from me
My love's a powder, can't wait to blow
Leaving destruction everywhere I go
Here's a warning in case you're confused
You don't wanna light my slow burning fuse
There's a real danger when we're together
We're as volatile as a ton of TNT
I think it's better if you just stay far away from me
There's a real danger when we're together
We're as volatile as a ton of TNT
I think it's better if you just stay far away from me
