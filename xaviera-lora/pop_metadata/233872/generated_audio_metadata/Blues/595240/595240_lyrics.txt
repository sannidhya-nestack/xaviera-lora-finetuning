Little dreamy, don't you love me? Don't you want me now?
Little dreamy, you're an idol, you're a golden child
More than you wanted
More than you need
Little dreamy, we're going down baby
I'm taking you down
Little dreamy, I can feel you, I can steal you blind
Little dreamy, you're so tight baby, let me help you unwind
Got what you wanted
Got what you need
A little dreamy
We're going down baby
I'm taking you down
Little dreamy, don't you love me? Don't you want me now?
Little dreamy, you're an idol, you're a golden child
Got what you wanted
Got what you need
Little dreamin'
We're going down baby
I'm taking you down
Little dreamin'
Little dreamin'
Little dreamin'
