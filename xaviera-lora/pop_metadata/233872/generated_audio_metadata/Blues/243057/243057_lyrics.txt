Close your eyes
Little soul
Believe in your heart
You will fly
You're a cop between your mother and your father
Cop between your teachers and your elders and their lies
You still breathe
Wild, wild, wild, wild roses
Wild, wild, wild, wild roses
Only six years old
You have a label on
Are they six years old?
Ooh, you still dream
Wild, wild, wild, wild roses
Wild, wild, wild, wild roses
Close your eyes
Little child
Spread your arms
You will fly
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild, wild roses
Wild, wild, wild, wild roses
