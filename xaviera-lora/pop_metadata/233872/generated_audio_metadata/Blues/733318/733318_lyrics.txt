Mmm, yeah, Mississippi
A Mississippi Delta down a long dusty road
Lives a pretty girl, my honeysuckle rose
Body's as hot as Mississippi at baking time
Kisses as sweet as watermelon wine
Long tan legs looking oh so fine
Eyes as blue as the Mississippi sky
Been hanging round Ruby since she turned sixteen
Ain't got no chance'cause her daddy's real mean
Daddy's got his shotgun with a buckshot load
Get out of here boy, you better hit that road
she's my little girl, she's my honeysuckle rose
Never let go of me, I'll keep on going, I'll keep on going, I'll keep on going, I'll keep on going
Oh, I parked the old Chevy at the end of the track
Said, "Run, Ruby, run, girl, there ain't no turning back"
A marriage license stashed behind the glovebox door
Left your daddy cussin' and stompin' on the floor
A buckshot pellets were kickin' up the dust
We called it love, but he called it love
Oh there's a little baby girl now with mama's big blue eyes
Eyes as blue as the Mississippi sky
She turned sixteen, boys are hanging round my door
I know you game boys, I've been here before
A bug shot, well it's gonna kick up that dust
You call it love
But I called it love
Daddy's got a shotgun with a buckshot load
Get out of here boys, you better hit that road
she's my little girl, she's still my honeysuckle rose
Daddy's got a shotgun with a buckshot load
Get out of here boys, you better hit that road
she's my little girl, she's still my honeysuckle rose
she's my little girl, she's still my honeysuckle rose
