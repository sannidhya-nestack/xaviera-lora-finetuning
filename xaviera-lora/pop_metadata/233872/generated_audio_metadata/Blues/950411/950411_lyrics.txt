I walked into darkness, that faithful day
Wasn't prepared for the choice I made
I took a wrong turn, I took a wrong turn along the way
We never recovered
It was too soon
And I regret
What I put you through
I took a wrong turn
I took a wrong turn
Away from you
In need of redemption, now I'm searching for the light
Please hear my confession, I got lost inside the night
If time were a healer, then you mend these broken wings
And put us back together, so this new life can begin
Fighting the memories that always play inside my head
And I can't escape
I took a wrong turn, I took a wrong turn along the way
In need of iveness and a fight for what we have
I suffer from weakness
But they're staying in the past
If time were a healer
Then you mend these broken wings
And put us back together
So this new life can begin
I walk in darkness
That's where I stay
Tellin'bout time to the big mistakes
I took a wrong turn, I took a wrong turn along the way
Yes, I took a wrong turn
I took a wrong turn
Along the way
Yeah
