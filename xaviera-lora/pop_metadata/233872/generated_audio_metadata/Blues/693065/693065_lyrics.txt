Now look right here and don't you see
I'm doing my part
If you live, don't have time to spare
Get yourself an all-power
If you treat me like a fool
I can't get the kids to school
If you think that you're so rare
Get yourself an all-power
Can't get the car started
Can't even get the seeds potted
Get yourself a millionaire
Is that wise?
Now you gonna tell me all those lies
Zip zip zip zip zip zip
Is that hip?
Won't you put a zipper on your lip?
Next week
I can hardly, hardly, hardly ever get to speak
You say, what's the difference baby, anyway?
Watch out, you don't need to holler, scream and stamp and shout
That view
Is chilling what you think I've done to you
Be smart
Now you know that I know that it wasn't me the one that broke your heart
It's you
Don't tell me what you're going through
If you don't change your thinking
How you gonna get things done
Live your life in troubles, man
And you're always, always on the run
Take care of what you say and do and what you will
Always fixin' your hair
So please, can't you see
I'm down here on my knees
And you're fixin' me with that stare
Your mind, it's in a fix
Like bricks and tricks
Oh baby, you're blind
So where, where we gonna find you, a millionaire?
Think on, walk it down
If you don't watch that drinking
Ears up on your health
I'm gonna end up right here on the floor
You're gonna end up on the shelf
Is that wise?
Now you've gonna tell me all those lies
Don't you think it's funny, babe?
I'm clean right out of money
But it's not my decision
If you'd please
Go tell it to the furry ones, the birds and bees
So where, where you gonna find a millionaire?
So where, where you gonna find a millionaire
So cool with the jive, it's twenty to five and the car is bursting with heat
I got the lead on my feet and you're fixing me with that stare
It's what you get for City Life, living in the city
