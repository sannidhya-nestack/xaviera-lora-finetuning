I've been gone too long
Gone too long from you
I've been gone too long
Gone too long from you
Well my heart was aching
Now it's broken too
Well I left that town
Left one rainy day
Well, I left that town, left one rainy day
Had to leave you, baby, had to find my way
Leave that town, yeah
Well the days drank on nights are lonesome too
Yes the days drank on nights are lonesome too
And I will wait time, but will I ever find you?
I've been gone too long
Gone too long from you
Yes I've been gone too long
Gone too long from you
Well my heart was aching
Now it's broken too
Gone too long
My heart was aching, I was broken too
