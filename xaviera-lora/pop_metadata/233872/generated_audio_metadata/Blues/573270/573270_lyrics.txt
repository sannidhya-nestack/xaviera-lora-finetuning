Despite your complaining baby
Looks like we made it here alive
Despite your complaining
Looks like we're all safe, sound and alive
Well you can boss me around some baby
But don't tell me how to drive
You know the queen bee tells the worker bee
To fetch some honey from the hive
You know the queen bee tells the worker bee
Bee, you work at nine to five
Until the day you die
You can bust me around Queen Bee
But don't you tell me how to drive
You can tell me what to wear
Tell me what to say
You can tell me when to come
And when to go away
But don't tell me how to drive
Don't do it
Don't you tell me how to drive
Don't tell me
Don't tell me how to drive
Yes dear, I hear you talking shit
I hear you talking jive
Baby you can go on and talk that mess
Baby you can go on and talk that jive
If I had me a good, good gal
I'd have me a little peace and quiet when I'm trying to drive
You can tell me'bout your day over and over again
You can bad mouth my mama
You can mess around with all my friends
But don't tell me how to drive
Don't you tell me how to drive
And for God's sake don't tell me
How to parallel park
