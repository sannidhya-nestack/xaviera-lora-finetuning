Oh, when the ghost of Louisiana
Moves with grace over Bourbon Street
Through the summer heat
Smell the Cajun food as she dances
To the Mississippi Delta Blues
To the Mississippi Delta Blues
To the Mississippi Delta Blues
And as if on cue
She drifts to the bayou
Where Cajun witches make their brew
Steams like a sauna with New Orleans drama
Down in the French Quarter
Down in the French Quarter
Down in the French Quarter
And as the night becomes a blanket
And the witches prepare a banquet
Those dancing shadows in the dark
Can only be the ghosts of Louisiana
And everyone will know that
The dancing is more than a show
Oh, the dancing is more than a show
And the ghost of Louisiana
Moves with grace over Bourbon Street
Through the summer heat
Smell the Cajun food as she dances
To the Mississippi Delta Blues
To the Mississippi Delta Blues
To the Mississippi Delta Blues
To the Mississippi Delta Blues
