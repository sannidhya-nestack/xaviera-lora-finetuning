Is it the way you move?
Is it the way you talk?
Or the way you look at me before the lights are off
Now I'm no mathematician
There's only so much I can define
On this finite line
The only answer to my questions
Is I can't get you off of my mind
Does it matter if it's morning?
Does it matter if it's night?
Oh, I think about you
The whispers when you hold me tight
You've turned the lock now, you hold the key
It's just the way you do, the things you do to me
The way you call my name
I went my backs against the wall
The way you grind my coffee
Oh, until I can't drink at all
I can't get you out
No, I can't get you out of my mind
Lord, not anytime
You hold the answers to my questions
Please just fill in between the lines
Baby now take your time
Doesn't matter if it's morning
Doesn't matter if it's night
All I think about are the whispers
Baby when you hold me tight
You've turned my lock now
You hold the key
It's just the way you do the things you do to me
Oh, the way you do the things you do to me
You hold my lock, you've got my key
Oh, the way you do
The way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do to me
