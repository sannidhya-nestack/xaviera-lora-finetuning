Yeah, I saw that cute little baby in his mother's arms
He grew up to be a monster, I don't understand
How does it happen?
Talkin'bout you
There's no low, too low
There's nobody's heart
You won't smash talking'bout you
Steal the coins from a dead man's eyes
Talking'bout you
Say your mother, your sister, had a brother
You'd tell'em too
I'm talking'bout you
Oh, and the evil things that you do
You're standing at the edge of the world
I'd like to push you off
Talking'bout you
Talking'bout you
You've got ice in your chest
Where there should be a heart
There's nothing you can say
No place to start
There's nothing too evil
Nothing too low
There's nobody you won't screw
There's nothing you won't do
You're standing at the edge of the world
I'd like to push you off
Talking'bout you
Talking'bout you
Talking'bout you
Steal the coins from a dead man's eyes
Or you say your mother, your sister had a brother
You'd send him to
I'm talking'bout you
All the evil things that you do
Oh there's nothing too low, nothing too cruel, nothing too mean
There's nothing you won't do
You're like a disease, you're rotten
You're like a disease, you're rotten, you're spreading
You're an empty shell of a man
You have no heart, you will never take a stand
You take, take, take and you backstab everyone down the line
I'm talking about you baby, I'm talking about you
When you come across one of these, son of a bitches
You won't believe your eyes, they'll give you the itches
I couldn't believe that somebody like that exists
And it took me all, and all at my own risk, oh you
I'm talkin'bout you, talkin'bout you
You'd steal the coins from a dead man's eyes
Sell your mother, sell your sister, you had a brother
You'd tell him too, I'm talkin'bout you
Steal the coins from a dead man's eyes
You'd sell your mother, your sister, had a brother
You'd tell him too, I'm talkin' about you
I'm talkin'bout you
