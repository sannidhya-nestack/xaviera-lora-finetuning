Walked in the bar with a twenty and a tenth
There were two women and three or four men
Had four or five beers and a couple of gins
And there was I, drunk and broke again
I don't know where the money goes
I just don't know
Where the money goes
I got back home
About quarter to two
Nothing in my pocket
And feeling blue
There was my wife
Holding out her hand
She wanted a fifty
To send to Japan
I don't know
Where the money goes
I just don't know
Where the money goes
Well I'm as honest as the day is long
But every time I look around my money's gone
I swear I just don't know
Where the money goes
I gotta pay the rent and taxes too
Gas and electric bills are due
But a bottle of wine took my last ten
I ain't drunk but I'm broke again
I don't know where the money goes
I just don't know where the money goes
Well, I'm as honest as the day is long
But every time I look around my money's gone
I swear I just don't know
Where the money goes
I don't know where it goes
No one knows where the money goes
I just don't know
I don't know
All my money all gone
I don't know where the money goes
Just gone
All gone
All gone
