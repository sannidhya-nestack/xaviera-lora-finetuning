Son, I'll see you in the morning
When I go and leave this town
For it's time for me to meet the desert
Put these cowboy boots on sandy ground
Put these cowboy boots on sandy ground
Who's gonna say, "Hey son, how you doing?
Can I play you a sad song today?
Well this old cowboy, now he's been drinking
And I feel like riding the blues today
Think I'll ride the blues today, ride the blues
Now that woman knows that I love her
Still she goes and treats me this way
So it's time for me to search for freedom
Beneath those starry skies so far away
Beneath those starry skies so far away
Who's gonna say hey son how you doing
Can I play you a sad song today
Well this old cowboy now he's been drinking
And I feel like riding the blues today
And I feel like riding the blues today
Think I'll ride the blues today
Think I'll ride the blues today
