I got to thinking about my baby last night
She's the one that used to hold me tight
But lately days it just don't seem to be working out
I want to take her for a ride in my'69 Sting
Hair flowing back, cruising down the lane
Come on baby, shake it for me one last time (shake for me one last time)
I want to take her down to Old Beanzetti
Show her off to Frank and Freddie
Let'em all know I still got what it takes
I race on down, looking for some heat
I jump on the key, still looking for a beat
Come on baby, shake it for me one last time
Shake it for me one last time
Well, I think about the time that has been wasted
When she's got the curves and all the right places
Jump in baby, let's go for a ride
I'm gonna show you the town with a little bit of style
Maybe we can sneak off and be alone for a while
Come on baby, shake it for me one last time (shake it for me one last time)
Come on baby
Shake it for me one last time
Come on baby
Shake it for me one last time
