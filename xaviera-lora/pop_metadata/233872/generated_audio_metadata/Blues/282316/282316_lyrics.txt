Some girls like to rope their boys
Like the cowboys at a rail rodeo
They wanna hog time, watch'em cry
Humiliate'em, drag'em round the field
Sayin', "My, my, my"
I don't think that's the way to do it, girls
Naw, that ain't the way to do it, girls
Yes, in my love garden there is not one weed
My sweet loving man has got everything that I need
Lucky, lucky me
My man is sweet as the honey from a honeybee
Lucky, lucky me
You can't lose all the time
You just can't lose all the time
You can't lose all the time
I am living proof
That if you just keep on trying
You will be dancing from the roof
Lucky, lucky me
My man is sweet as the honey from the honeybee
Live beyond the game
Worth gamblin' on
Yeah, love the only game
That's worth gamblin' on
You can lose ninety-nine percent of the time
You only have to win that one time
That one time, that one time
Well you just got to keep on trying
Don't give up, just keep on trying
Love's the only game worth gambling on
You can lose 99 % of the time
Yes, and I see the future, I see the past
And I know my good love's gonna last
Hey, lookie, lookie me
I got a man that's just right for me
Yeah, lucky, lucky me
He's just right for me
He's sweet as the honey from a honeybee
Lucky, lucky me
You got to keep on trying
Don't give up
Got to keep on trying
Don't give up, yeah
Don't you try to cry and cry
And throw it all away
I lost my mind
I lost my heart
I lost my last dime
I can't take it anymore
I just won't get up and try one more time
Yeah, you can lose 99 % of the time
When you're gamblin' with love
Hey baby you can lose ninety-nine percent of the time
When you're gamblin' with love
You only have to win that one time
To win the game of love
