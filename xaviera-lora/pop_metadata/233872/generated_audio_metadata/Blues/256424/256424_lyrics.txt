I've been working hard all day and all night
Coming home to my baby
She makes it feel so right
In this world I can't make it all alone
Not all alone
That's why, why I'm so glad
Good loving makes a happy home
A happy home
We hold on, me and my baby
Even when things just don't work out
We still have love
Those times when it's not easy
And we just can't see eye to eye
Me and my baby do alright
I don't look for trouble
No time for fooling around
Just want to keep life simple
Keep both my feet on the ground
Sometimes trouble finds a way that never
Keeps knocking on my door
But no, I won't listen to him
I know it's just a pack of lies
A pack of lies
We hold on, me and my baby
Even when things just don't work out
We still have love
Those times when it's not easy
And we just can't see eye to eye
Me and my baby do alright
Me and my baby do alright
Me and my baby
Me and my baby
