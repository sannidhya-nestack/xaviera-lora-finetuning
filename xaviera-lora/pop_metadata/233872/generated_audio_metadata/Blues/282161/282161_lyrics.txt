When the evening sun goes down
You will find me just hanging round
The night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
There's lots of people just like me
All dreaming of that old time used to be
The nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life
Listen to the blues the man is playing
Listen to what the blues are saying
My life is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
And when evening sun goes down
You will find me hanging round
The nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life
Well the night life
Ain't no good life
Oh but it's my life
