I know it's been a while
Since I last saw you smile
But I've been meaning to
Come and visit you
For some time
I'm on the train now
Climbing the mountain
Leaving the many for the few
Found some time
To do some dreaming
Where the sunshine is cool
I'm so happy to be lying here
On your worn out old brown couch
On the front porch in the daytime
Of your peaceful mountain house
There's a magpie in the tree And a flutter in my heart
I can hear you laughing in the kitchen
And that's far enough apart
I'm so happy to be lying here
On your worn out old brown couch
On the front porch
In the daytime
Of your peaceful mountain house
