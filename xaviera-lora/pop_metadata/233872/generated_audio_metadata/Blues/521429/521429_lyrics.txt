I think that I'll go fishing
And stay away all year
Cause all them politicians
They be saying things that I don't wanna hear
Every election year they tell you what you wanna hear
Just until they get elected
Say they gonna rearrange but not a damn thing gonna change
So I'm gone fishing all year
I don't care what party they come from
Or the policy they proclaim
They want their power and they gone get some
Cause ego tripping is the name of their game
I had to quit Facebook and Twitter
Cause they be lying when they tweet
They bona fide bullshitters
So I'm gone catch a false asleep
Wake me up when it's over
They're really just the same nominees
Nothing but a bunch of red rovers
On a paid vacation up in DC
So I'll just do me some fishing
Stay away all year
all the politicians
Stop saying things that I don't wanna hear no way
Yeah, election year gonna tell you what you wanna hear
Just so to get elected
All those lame ass slogans got me gaggin' and chokin'
So I'm gone fishin' all year
