Mississippi Delta grabbed a hold of me
It was at the crossroads I sold my soul
So I could master the blues
The rest is history
Some call me grandfather of rock and roll
I played at every Jew joint in town
In time I became the king
Every night I broke the house down
Folks said that I could sing
I was a country boy turned late-ass man
That got me in trouble more than once
It might have put an end to my life
After three days, life was gone from me
I live on as the first modern blues man
Who could play it back to front
Sweet home Chicago was a city filled with strife
But I really love that intensity
Cause I'm a blues man
With those breaking down blues
Oh yeah
My guitar was my second voice,'cause I could really make her sing
Clapton said my music's so full, so I guess I became a legacy, a legacy
I was more than some honey-tongue fool
To have plain blues was my destiny
Carnegie Hall might have called to me
When I had those walk-in blues
I was a country boy turned latest man
Got me in trouble more than once
Might have put an end to my life
After three days life was gone from me
I live on as the first modern blues man
Who could play it back to the front
Sweet home Chicago was a city filled with strife
But I really, really love that intensity
I'm a bluesman
With those breaking down blues, oh yeah
I'm a bluesman, that's my legacy
I'm a bluesman, that's my legacy
Oh yeah
