Trouble's calling like a whisper in the night
Walking down a lonesome road searching for the light
Got a heavy heart and a weary kind of soul
Every mile I travel, feel it taking its toll
Oh, the rain keeps falling on this empty town
With a storm inside me I can't bend down
Playing for salvation with the shadows dance
Hoping for redemption in a leap of chance
Stars are hiding, lost behind the mist
Every breath I take feels like a broken twist
Chasing dreams through the echoes of the past
Trying to find a future but how long will it last?
Waves of silence crash upon the shore
While my heart keeps beating, begging for more
In the stillness there's a story to be told
A journey through the lightning, so fierce and bold
Oh, the rain keeps falling on this empty town
With a storm inside me I can't pin down
Prayin' for salvation where the shadows dance
Hopin' for redemption and leave a chance
So I'll keep on rollin' with this old guitar
Singin' tales of heartache from near and far
Searchin' for tomorrow down this lost highway
In every note I play, find my way, my way
So I'll keep on rolling with this old guitar
Singing tales of heartache from near and far
Searching for tomorrow down this lost highway
In every note I play, find my way, my ways
