Mississippi
The fields of white
Deep grey water
A river so wide
It's going home
Going tonight
Locomotive
Train on the track
Steam is blowing
From a smoke stack
He's on his way, freedom at last
Now he's going on down, going on
Walking further on down
Down the road
Going back home
Southern crossroads, walking alone
Past that taper
Under the sun
Heading back
It won't be too long
Now he's going on down
Going on
Walking further on down
There on that road
Now it's going on down
Going back home
Walking farther on down
Down the road
Going home
I'm going back home
