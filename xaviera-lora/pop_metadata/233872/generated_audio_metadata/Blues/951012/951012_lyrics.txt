Sittin' alone with a bed of frowns
Reflectin' on life when the blues comes around
Driftin' away to a distant shore
Tryin' to play my escape
The night of the dark, like a ball from the blue
You sent me a song, and the words next to two
They showed me a place where the graves are clear
And soon I'll et all my fears, the colors are bright
They flow from the river of life
The angel flew by
And sold me in the river of life
No need for the sun on the lunar phase
Receiving the light from that enchanted place
I'm moving on out from the dampest past
And now there is no going back
You hope of a gaze
Stepped out of the blue
This time you saw a hope
The words they come true
Or followed it back
With the words of truth
And famous whenever of all
The colors shine bright
The flow from the river of life
The angel flew by
And show me the river of life
The colors are bright
We flow from the river of life
The angels flew by
And showed me the river of life
The colors are bright
They flow from the river of life
Behind the river of life
I saw me the river of life
I saw me the river of life
I saw me the river of life
