Three thousand miles is a long way to go
Borrowed just one ticket, I'm gonna do this alone
Sick of nine to five, finally told my boss to go to hell
Guess one man's pleasure is another man's jail
I'm moving on, you know it's time to make your move
But I'm a long way, long way from home
Like a drifter in the wind, my soul's scattered everywhere
Can't keep this running, running, running, can't settle anywhere
Bet you thought you had it made, you didn't have a clue
Love's an illusion for poets and fools
That's why I'm moving on
You know it's time to make your move
But I'm a long way, long way from home
Medicine man, please help me if you can
Medicine man, oh
Open my eyes, I can see, set me free, you can run but you can't hide (open my eyes, I can see, I can see)
So I'm moving on
You know it's time to make your move
But I'm a long way
Yes, I'm a long way
Yes, I'm a long way
Long way from home
Long way from home
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh..
