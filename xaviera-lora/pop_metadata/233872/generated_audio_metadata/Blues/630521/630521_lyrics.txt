Take the hand out
Take the hand out
Take the hand out
I'm listening to the newscast
All the bad things that come my way
Falling down down down down
Under the weight
Living here right now in Bluesville UK
I'm standing in the shadows
Trying to break out of the sorry blue
But I'm pinned down, down, down, down
Sticking like glue, yeah it's true
it's here right now
The Great British Blues
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
From London to Glasgow
South Yorkshire to Lancaster Gates
We're all feeling down down down down
Under the strain and from the rain
Livin' here right, right now
In Bluesville, UK
Blues
Blues are okay
Blues
