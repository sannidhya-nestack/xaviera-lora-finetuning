Here I sit like some helpless jerk
First I'm up then I'm down
I don't dare move and I don't dare stay
I don't dare make a sound
On my toes and on my knees all at once
I'm dancing
You got me dancing
Girl, I want you so bad it makes me hurt
I want your whispered sorrow
I love that song I've never heard
Words I've never learned
Pull my string and make me sing
Make me jump into action
Got me dancing
You got me dancing baby
You got me dancing, you got me dancing, baby
You see, I want you so bad it makes me hurt
I want your whispered song
I love that song I've never heard
Words I've never learned
Pull my sting and make me sing, make me jump into action
You got me dancing, you got me dancing baby
You got me dancing, you got me dancing
You got me dancing, dancing
