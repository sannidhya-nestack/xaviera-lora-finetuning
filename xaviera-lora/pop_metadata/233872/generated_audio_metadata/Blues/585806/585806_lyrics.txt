Another Saturday night and we got nothing to do
Boy you've been fighting with me and I've been fighting with you
It's occurred to me and it's become real clear
Before we strangle each other let's get out of here
Let's go get us some drinks that are stronger than pop
We'll go to Nodja's and dance and do the barrel house stomp
The flipper says our favorite band's back in town
They really rock the blues and they know how to get down
Put on your red dress baby now and get in the car
I want to see you dancing by nine in the bar
Well we'll order some drinks and it's straight for the floor
We'll do the barrel high stomp till we can't dance no more
We'll do the barrel high stomp
We'll do the barrel high stomp
We'll do the barrel high stomp
We'll do the barrel high stomp
We'll keep on rockin' the blues and we ain't never ever gonna stop
Another Saturday night and we found something to do
You quit fighting with me and I quit fighting with you
It occurred to me and it became real clear
It didn't feel a lot of good to get out of here
Well we got us some drinks that were stronger than pop
We had fun down the nudges with the barrel house stomp
Let's do the barrel house stomp
Let's do the barrel house stomp
Let's do the barrel house stomp
Let's do the barrel house stomp
We'll keep on rocking with blues and we ain't never ever gonna stop
We'll do the barrel house stomp
We'll do the barrel house stomp
We'll do the barrel house stomp
We'll do the barrel high stomp
We'll keep on rocking the blues and we ain't never ever gonna stop
We'll keep on rocking the blues and we ain't never ever gonna stop
Hey
We'll keep on rocking the blues and we ain't never ever gonna stop
