Rolling like a freight train's floating like the fourth of July
You come on like a hurricane, let me crawl inside the eye
You blow into town, guns all ablaze, cause you've got hell to raise
Where do I fit on your list
Do you have the time to give me a kiss
Do you have the time to love me
Make up your mind'cause it's the road on me
You're like Bronco Billy living out your wildest show
Been living in a fantasy, letting our reality go
It's low in the town, guns on the blaze
you've got heaven raised
Where do I fit on your list?
Do you have the time to give me a kiss?
Do you have the time?
For loving me
Make up your mind
it's the road only
Now do you have the time
For loving me
Make up your mind
it's the road only
Now listen boy, listen real good
Do you wanna make love to me
Or try to make it out in Hollywood
Do you have the time for loving me
Make up your mind'cause it's the road on me
Do you have the mind
To spend your life with me
Better stick now
Or ever hold your peace
Hey boy
What are you gonna do
You better knock me in or set me free
