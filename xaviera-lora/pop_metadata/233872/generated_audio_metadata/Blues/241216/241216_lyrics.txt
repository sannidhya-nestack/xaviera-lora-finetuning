I got two days to get back home
Two days, two days
And I'm broken, I'm alone
Twisting like a door
Moving like a rolling stone
Lord, if the sun
Ever shines on me
Will the sun
Kiss the shine on me
Gonna be a better man
Just you wait and see (Just you wait and see)
I got trouble
Trouble on my mind
Heartache and trouble
No peace I can find
High like a wheel rolling on down the line
I got two days, nothing but two days
Trouble on my mind, no peace I can find
I got two days, drifting like a dove
Moving like a rolling stone
Drifting like a dove, moving like a rolling stone
Heading down the highway, trying to find my way home
Heading down the highway, got them old traveling bones
Getting down my highway, getting down my highway, getting down my highway, getting down my highway, getting down my highway, getting down my highway, getting down my highway
Getting down my highway
Getting down my highway
Getting down my highway
