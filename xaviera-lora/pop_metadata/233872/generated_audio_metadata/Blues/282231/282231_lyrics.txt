There is a house in New Orleans They call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many a poor boy and girl
And God, I know I'm one
My mama was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My daddy was a gambling man
Way down in New Orleans
Now the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time my daddy was satisfied was when he was so drunk
So it's one foot on the platform
And it's one foot on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans
To the house of the rising sun
So mama, mama go tell my, my, my baby sister
Don't you do it, not what I have done
All she'll spend her love and shame, pain and misery
In the house of the rising sun
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
Oh it's been the roaring of many a poor boy and girl
And God I know, and God I know, and God I know
But I know I'm one
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know I'm one
