Girl, you played the victim like an Oscar winner
Had me nailed up on the cross just like I was a sinner
Diggin' on all the praises they're giving you for that role
I'm going in for your closer
And your director's in control
You had a three rank circus playing in your mind
I was walking up on the tightrope and I saw you cut the line
Working without a net baby as my world came crashing down
Lyin' in the sawdust like a broken hearted clown
I'm tired of wearin' my heart on my sleeve
Baby, I think it's time to leave, shoot me back on
I'm off the hook
Yeah, I swallowed the bait, ran with the light
Maybe a fool, deaf, dumb and blind, but no more
I'm off the hook, yeah baby, I'm off the hook
Well, you held me to the charges in the court of inquisition
You played judge and jury, even the mortician
I was burning up in the stake that you set on fire
Burned by the flames of passion
Of your madness I will
I'm tired of wearing my armor still
Baby I think it's time to leave through the back door
I'm off the hook
I swallowed the bait, ran with the line
Maybe a fool, deaf, dumb and blind
But no more, I'm off the hook
Well, you're wondering why you get a busy signal, baby
When you call me on the phone
Ain't no use in trying,'cause there ain't nobody home
Well, you wonder why you get a busy signal, baby, when you call me on the phone
Ain't no use in trying,'cause there ain't nobody home, well
You kiss me like Judas
And sew me down the river
Even the thought of you, girl
Makes my poor heart shiver
Why should I be surprised up
A woman that had me sized up
I was just a fool in a lying game
Now I've finally wised up
The tides of the wave hit my heart on my sleeve
Baby I think it's time to leave through the back door
I'm off the hook
Well I swallowed the bait and ran up the line
Maybe you're fooled, you're dumb and blind but no more
I'm off the hook
Yeah, I'm tied up and wearin' my heart on my sleeve
Baby, I think it's time to leave to the back door
I'm off the hook
Yeah, I swallowed the bait, ran with the line
Maybe a fool, deaf, dumb and blind, but no more
I'm off the hook
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, I'm off the hook, no more baby
Well, you're wondering why you get a busy single baby when you call me on the phone
Ain't no use in trying'cause there ain't nobody home
I'm off the hook
And you wonder why you get a business signal baby when you call me on the phone
