I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it
But I need it, so I'll chase it while I'm breathing
My neighbor, he's 18, he loves Jesus
Me a man, clap your hands'cause they need us
Me a man, clap your hands, women need us
Do you want it? It's not clear
It's time to face it, face those fears
Be a man, take a stand, wipe those tears
Be a man, clap your hands, wipe those tears
Be a man, clap your hands, face your fears
Be a man, clap your hands, women need you
Be a man, clap your hands, women need us
