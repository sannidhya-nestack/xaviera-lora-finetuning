Well lately days things just don't seem the same
Hey buddy can you spare some change
I know where you're going
You're gonna leave and go away
Think I'll take the last lonely train (take the last lonely train)
I'll take the last lonely train back home
I looked off the stage, there ain't nobody there
So I packed my gear and I had another beer
Waiting for a break, someone to compensate
Think I'll take the last lonely train (Take the last lonely train)
I'll take the last lonely train back home
Well here I go, wave bye bye
I've had enough, no more pie in the sky
Maybe grow some moss on this here rolling stone
Shit, I missed the last lonely train (missed the last lonely train)
I missed the last lonely train
