Lies, they come as no big surprise
Lies, only a lonely man cries
Baby don't you hurt me with your terrible lies
Oh those lies
I see them deep in your eyes
Lies
You need to apologize
Just tell the truth baby
Not more ridiculous lies
That's what I'm talkin' about, baby
Oh yeah, oh yeah, mmm
Lies, I don't believe your goodbyes
Lies, a move that's really unwise
I don't wanna deal with your incredible lies
All those lies
It's a game I despise
Mmm, lies
They're just a phony disguise
Honesty is always better
Than hearing more of your lies
I'll check it out now.
Oh your lies, they're the worst alibis
Lies, they'll cut you right down to size
Listen to me baby, I wanna tell you some lies
Oh, listen to me, baby, I wanna tell you some lies
Yeah, listen to me, baby, I'm gonna tell you some lies
Yes, I am bad, lies
