Don't take no stuff when you've had enough
Don't take no stuff when you've had enough
Oh life in the city people don't take no stuff
It ain't always pretty, say when, when you've had enough
Don't take no stuff when you've had enough
Don't take no stuff when you've had enough
Growing up in the city you had to be tough
The riots weren't pretty and the people were rough
I ain't looking for no cheat thrills but saying I've had enough
There ain't no magic chill pill to bring it up to snuff
Don't take no stuff when you've had enough
Don't take no stuff
When you've had enough
Gangs of people running scared
Straining politics in the hood
Gave up hope cause no one cared
Stomping out all that was good
Trash talking my name
Gonna say my sad goodbye
City's just two aisles of tame
I'm too tired of all the lies
When you're in the windy city
People try and call your bluff
It helps if you're witty
Life there can be rough
Don't take no stuff when you've had enough
Don't take no stuff
When you've had enough
Don't take no stuff
Don't take no stuff
When you've had enough
