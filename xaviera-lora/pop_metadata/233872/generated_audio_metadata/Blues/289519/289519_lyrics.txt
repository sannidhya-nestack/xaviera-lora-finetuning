My lady love flew far away
To where the sun shines bright
I walk the lonely streets by day
I stay up half the night
I listen to the radio
But grow weary of the news
So I play her banjo, but it only plays the blues
My lady love sleeps far away
And I just don't have a clue
I cannot seem to concentrate
On things that I should do
I try to read some magazines
But grow tired of their views
So I play her mandolin
But it only plays the blues
One day my lady will return and it will be a sight
To watch the cats both run to her with sounds of their delight
Until that welcome day arrives we remain a motley crew
So I play her violin, but it only plays the blues
