Nicotine stains and cigarette burns
Are part of a wheel that turns
Young into old, love into gold
Life is just a little dream
I live to breathe under the strips of alcohol
Lines out of my face, tell of black holes
Mistaking chances, broken friendships
A lost innocence
The death of everything in me
Makes my touch as deadly as cancer
Tell me what should I eat
How could I have seen
That life was all but clean
I regret a lot, drink and scream
Addiction to eat, the feeling, the taste
Recurring illusions
Our psyche known a cause
The one that stands amongst you's goals
These things can kill
These things can kill
Die
Life is a notion
The depth of everything in me
Makes my touch as deadly as cancer
I dream a lot of what could be
Close my eyes if I don't want to see
Life is an illusion
People stay far behind the mask
Shaking heads I'll turn away
As my blood flows down the drain
How else I'd to know the cost
The one night stands, the misuse grows
These things can kill you
