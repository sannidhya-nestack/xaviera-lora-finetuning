Here she comes again
Like a long lost friend
And you just stand there
With open arms
She leads you along
With her same sad song
And you intently listen
Holding on
When you gonna let her go
When you gonna let her know that you can
Keep holding on
I gotta let you know
If you can't let her go
I can't keep holding on
Here she comes again
This something I can't win
Am I holding out, holding on
To something that's not mine
Yeah, you live and learn
But I think it's her turn
To fall in the shadows
That I'm grown to know
Oh, now, now, now
When you gonna let her go
When you gonna let'em know that you can't keep holding on?
And if you care to go, I gotta let you know that I won't keep holding on, holding on
You can't recognize
You gotta cut the ties
To find the one you wanna hold on to
And I won't stand behind
she's still on your mind
I guess that loving me is not enough for you
Holding on
When you gonna let it go
When you gonna let'em know that you can't keep holding on
if you can't let it go
I gotta let you know that I can't
I can't keep holding, holding on
Oh, you don't let it go
I gotta let you know
If you can't realize you got a good chance
I can't keep holding, holding, holding on
