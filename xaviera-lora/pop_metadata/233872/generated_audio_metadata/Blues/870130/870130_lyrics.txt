A dim lit bar, cold winter night
A young man downs a shot
A contract staring in his face
Should he sign or not
It's life or death, it's him or her
The reaper says it's so
A dim lit bar, one winter night
To sign away his soul
Poet, prophet, sinner, saint, help me find my fate
I know I left it somewhere but life is getting late
So many turns, so many falls, were all the choices wrong
Poet, prophet, sinner, saint, you've been here all along
He saw the future in his dreams, his wife with child would die
Repeatedly it haunted him
But miracles survive
A bargain with the reaper
A contract in the bar
His signature to save her life
But he must au revoir
Poet, prophet, sinner, saint
Help me find my fate
I know I left it somewhere
But life is getting late
So many turns, so many falls
Where all the choice is wrong
Poet, prophet, sinner, saint, you've been here all along
Poet, prophet, sinner, saint, just one and the same
His future child won't know him, yet he'll share his name
Poet, prophet, sinner, saint, help me find my fate
I know I left it somewhere, but life is getting late
So many turns, so many falls, where all the choice is wrong
Poet, prophet, sinner, sage, you've been here all along
Poet, prophet, sinner, sage, you've been here all along
