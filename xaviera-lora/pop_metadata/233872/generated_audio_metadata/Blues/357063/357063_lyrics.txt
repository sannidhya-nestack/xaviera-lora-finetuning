Don't you let her ever break your heart
Don't you let her take your world and tear it apart
Let her know you're out from under her spell
And it's all just as well
Don't you let her do the things she do
I can see that you're still here
After all she's put you through
Let her know you're out from under her spell
And it's all just as real
She only wants you for a rainy day
Then you know she'll toss you out and throw you away
Let her know you're out from under her spell
And it's all just as well
Don't you let her know she's got you down
Just turn and walk away my friend
Don't you dare look around
Let her know you're out from under her spell
And it's all just as well
Don't you let her ever break your heart
Don't you let her take your world and tear it apart
Let her know you're out from under her spell
And it's all just as well
