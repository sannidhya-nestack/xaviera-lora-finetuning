The weather's wrong here at home
Freezing cold in my bones
I watch the wind blowin' by
Trouble in mind, it's cold outside
But the chill that I feel
Came when you said goodbye
Old howlin' wind at my door
Lord, I can't handle too much more
I'm stiff and I'm cold
My body aches getting older
You were mine
Those were the times I'd take to my grave
Cold weather blues got me locked up
Got me drinking, thinking'bout you
There's a cold breeze setting in
Fire's warm, come on in
Tomorrow the sun will shine once again
Yeah tomorrow the sun will shine once again
Oh tomorrow the sun will shine once again
