Another payday
But the wall's still caving in
I need more money and it seems I'll never win
World keeps on turning
Machine keeps on churning
Goodness, gracious, trouble all around me
I got no power, nothing ever works out right
And when it seems so dark it's hard to find the light
No time for crying, too busy trying
Goodness gracious, trouble all around me
Trouble all around me
Will it ever work out right
Trouble all around me
How will I make it through the night
Lord I'm trying
But there's no denying
Goodness, gracious, trouble all around
