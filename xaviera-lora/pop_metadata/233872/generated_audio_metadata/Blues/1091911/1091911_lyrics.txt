She's always griping at me
things we ain't got
And riding on me sideways
everything I'm not, I say
You should be talking to me baby
Real sweet and nice
She'd just look at me real cold and say, "Is that right?"
She'd criticize my friends
Every chance she'd get
Her tongue just like a razor
Never let me rest, I say
I'm outta here baby
Come midnight tonight
She just look at me real cold and say
Is that right?
When judgment come she'll have a long hard pray
St. Peter read off all her sins
I know what she will say
She'll say if you ive me Petey
I promise I'll be nice
I hope he just look at her real cold and say
Is that right?
