My old lady left me here on my own
I ain't got no money, no place to go
But I know I'll be okay, I got a plan to spend my day
Just me and Jimmy Bean watching the rain
Well the car don't work and dogs run away
I got a big old stack of bills yeah I ain't gonna pay
So I got some time to waste
I'm gonna sit down have me a taste
Just me and Jimmy Beam watching the rain
Times they come, times they go
When they stop you wish they don't
Through your hands like a slippery rope
On a rainy, drudgery day
You catch a break or let it fall
Where it stops you'll never know
Watch it roll across the floor
Right out the door
The times they come, the times they go on
When they stop you, wish they don't
Through your hands like a slippery rope
On a rainy G ia day
You catch a break and let it fall
When it stop you never know
Watch it roll across the floor
Right out the door
Song commence shining, rain slowing down, yeah
Been sitting in this window all day long
Got nothing more to say, lord it's been a wonderful day
Just me and Jimmy Beam watching the rain, oh yeah
Just me and Jimmy Bean, watching the rain
One more time, yeah, just me and Jimmy Bean, watching the rain
