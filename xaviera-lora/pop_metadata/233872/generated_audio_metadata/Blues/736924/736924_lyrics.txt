It's not like me to sit around and cry
But I haven't been myself all night
I'm like a coyote waiting for the moon
I've got the air in the meantime, in between time blue
I'll be just fine when my baby gets home
He has a cure for being left alone
I'm like a ship adrift, abandoned by the crew
I've got the enemy time, in between time blues
Well, the TV's a-watchin' me
I'm walkin' the floor, starin' at the door
You better hurry up and get here soon
Yeah, I haven't slept, I've lost my appetite
I call the doctor but I know the signs
I'm comin' down with somethin' I've nothin' much to do
Ooh, I've got the air in the meantime
In between time to lose
Well, well, the TV is watching me
I walk in the floor, staring at the door
Better hurry up and get here soon, yeah
I'll be just fine when my baby gets home
Yeah, secure from being left alone
Like a ship adrift, abandoned by the crew
Yeah, I've got the in the meantime, in between time blues
I've got the in the meantime, in between time blues
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, in the meantime
In between tan and blue
