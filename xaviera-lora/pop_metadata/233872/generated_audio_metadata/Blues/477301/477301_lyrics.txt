Some folks need money
Some just need shoes
Some are born winners
Others born to lose
Some need that cocaine
Others need booze
But I don't need nothing but the blues
And some folks need religion, yeah, that's a fact
And some live in castles, others in shacks
Or some need the battle, yeah, some need the bruise
But I don't need nothing but the bruise
The end is near.
Yeah some folks need money
Well some just need shoes
Some are born winners
Others born to lose
Yeah some need that cocaine
Others need booze
But I don't need nothing
Yeah, I don't need nothin' (I don't need nothin')
Oh, I don't need nothin' but the blues
I don't need nothin', yeah, nothin' but the blues
