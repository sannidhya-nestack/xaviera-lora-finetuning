Well, a big black cat must've crossed my path last night
Yeah, a big black cat must've crossed my path last night
'Cause ever since last evening
Things ain't going right
I went to work this morning
Like I always do
Boss said here's your pink slip
Sign the date you're through
A big black cat
Must've crossed my path last night
Ever since last evening
Things ain't going right
On my way back home
I stopped into a bar
While I was in there drinking
They towed away my car
A big black cat
Must have crossed my path last night
Yeah, ever since last evening things ain't going right
Finally made it home, asked my baby for a kiss
She told me she was leaving, and that I'd not be missed
A big black cat, I must have crossed my path last night
Well now everything seems so miserable, things ain't going right
I said a big black cat
Yeah a big black cat
Yeah a big black cat
Big black cat
You know a big black cat must have crossed my path last night
Well, a big black cat must've crossed my path last night
Yeah, a big black cat must've crossed my path last night
Cause ever since last evening things ain't going right
I went to work this morning like I always do
Boss said here's your pink slip, sign the date you're through
A big black cat must've crossed my path last night
Ever since last evening things ain't going right
On my way back home
I stopped into a bar
While I was in there drinking
They towed away my car
A big black cat
Must have crossed my path last night
Yeah, ever since last evening
Things ain't going right
Finally made it home, asked my baby for a kiss
She told me she was leaving, and that I'd not be missed
A big black cat, I must have crossed my path last night
