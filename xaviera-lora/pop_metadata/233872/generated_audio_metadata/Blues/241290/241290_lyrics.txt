I strayed from your mainland
And now I'm lost at sea
I thought if I sailed into uncharted waters
The uncertainty would set me free
But one-time friendly faces
Now seem to all deny me
I lost my tether to the shore
I don't know if I can do this anymore
Rescue me
Won't you rescue me
I thought I was all alone
There's another boat floating past
Seems there's two ships of fools out here on their own
And neither one is bound to last
There's a storm front moving in
The waves are climbing so high
The sky is black and there's nowhere to run
But I'm not the only one who's out here looking for someone to rescue me
Won't you rescue me
They pushed me from the mainland
And now I'm lost at sea
I'm sure if I sailed into uncharted waters
The uncertainty would set me free
Old time friendly faces
Now seem to all deny me
I lost my tether to the shore
I don't know if I can do this anymore
Rescue me, yeah
Won't you rescue me?
Come on now, yeah
