What's left? Won't somebody go to the cupboard and see
What's left?
Didn't anybody save anything for me?
I just can't face my whole life
This little old piece of cheese
Somebody, anybody, somebody, please
Why don't you check one more time for me
Somebody, somebody, somebody, please
Please check one more time for me
When I got there, nobody had saved a thing for me
They say the strong gets more
Yeah well the weak ones fade
I don't believe that's the case today now baby
I believe that nobody's safe
What's left what's left what's left
Won't somebody check one more one more time for me
I just can't face my whole life
This little old eatsy beansy teensy weensy moldy microscopic piece of cheese
