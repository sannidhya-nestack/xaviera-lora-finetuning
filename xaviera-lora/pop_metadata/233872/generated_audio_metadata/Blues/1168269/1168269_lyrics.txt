Hey, hey, one-eyed Jack
He took my money, he don't give it back
Now he rides around in a Cadillac
I think I've seen the last of one-eyed Jack
That's what you get when you play the game
A song full of wishes, a hat full of rain
But I'll never know, never know, never ever do that again
I'll just hold my heart and only use my brain
Hey Jack, what you gonna do when your luck runs out and you bankroll too?
Gonna find a sugar mama who'll take care of you?
Well I know that story, it ain't nothing new
That's what you get when you don't see straight
Playing with pirates and pieces of eight
Well, I'll never know, I'll never know, I'll never ever repeat that fate
I'll just go on home and double lock the gate
Hey Jack, you know it's true
Joker's wild, he's gonna get you too
Then the Queen of Hearts will see the last of you
Me, I'm waiting for a king
But the deuce knows who
That's what you get when you love in vain
Eyes full of stardust, hat full of rain
Well, I'll never know, I'll never know, I'll never ever do that again
I'll just hold my heart and only use my brain
Hey, hey, one-eyed Jack
He took my money, he don't give it back
Now he roads around in a Cadillac
I think I've seen the last
I think I've seen the last
I think I've seen the last of one-eyed Jack
