I got no money, I got no home
I've seen those bad times all up and down life's road
But I don't worry'cause I know
That it's bound to be better one day
Well sometimes you will
Most times down
I've seen so many
So many lose their ground
But you can't worry
You just gotta know
That it's bound to be better one day
I lived like a king
And one day I felt
I lost my wife and kid in that rotten deal
But I don't worry
Cause I know
That it's gonna be better one day
Now God give you nothing
That you can't take
So be sure of those lessons from what you make
But you can't worry
You've just gotta know
That it's gonna be better one day
Well sometimes you're up, most times down
I've seen so many, so many lose their ground
But you can't worry, you've just gotta know
That it's gonna be better one day
Now God gave you nothing that you can't take
So be sure of those lessons from what you make
But you can't worry
You've just gotta know
That it's gonna be better one day
No, you can't worry
You've just gotta know that it's gonna be better one day
