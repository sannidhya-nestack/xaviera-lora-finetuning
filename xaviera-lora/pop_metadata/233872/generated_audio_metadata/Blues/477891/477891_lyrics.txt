Sixty-eight Pontiac, got it
Sixty-eight Pontiac, got it
Sixty-eight Pontiac, got it
Sixty-eight Pontiac
Sixty-eight Pontiac, all I wanna do is ride
You're the fancy guy, better off than she's
Don't suit, don't tie, know what I mean
No car that gets me bucked
All I wanna do is take you out
Sixty-eight Pontiac, all I wanna is ride
Another'68 Pontiac, got a'68 Pontiac
Pontiac,'68 Pontiac
Pontiac, all I wanna do is ride
Never want a London from the start
If that's too much it'll break my heart
Laidback guy, not a laidback girl
She's with me one time in the world
Pontiac, all I wanna do is ride
Sixty-eight, Pontiac, daughter
Sixty-eight, Pontiac
Sixty-eight, Pontiac
Sixty-eight, Pontiac
Sixty-eight, Pontiac, all I wanna do is ride
Sat back today, watch the sun fade away
It made me happy, it made me say
Need no high, don't need no bein'
All this time, I'm glad to be here
Sixty-eight, Pontiac, all I wanna do is ride
Well, I got no time for anxiety
You don't like it, you don't like me
Tellin' me you gotta have more stuff
And I keep sayin' I got nothin'
Pontiac, all I wanna do is ride
Pontiac, got a'68 Pontiac
Pontiac,'68 Pontiac
Pontiac, all I wanna do is ride
Another fancy guy, better off in jeans
Don't sit no time, know what I mean
No crowd, pitch ain't bound
All I wanna do is take you out
Pontiac, all I wanna do is ride
Pontiac, all I wanna do is ride
Pontiac, all I wanna do is drive
Pontiac, all I wanna do is ride
All I wanna do is ride
All I wanna do is ride
All I wanna do is ride
Yeah, all I wanna do is ride
Pontiac, all I wanna do is ride
All I wanna do is ride
Yeah, all I wanna do is ride
All I wanna do is ride
All I wanna do is ride
Pontiac, all I wanna do is ride
