I walk in a bar in any city or town
Any old place where there's people around
I buy me a beer, oh baby, three or four
And I start to talking to some of the lonely soul
We talk about the heartaches, that's when the liquor starts to flow
Caught in a trap, I can't find my way back from this
Drinkin' life
Yeah, I drink to your health
And I drink when you die
Yeah, I drink to keep laughin', yes I
And I drink when I cry
When the sun goes down
Yes, you'll find me there at the bar
And sometimes I wonder
If I could ever have been
The kind of man that you wanted me to be
You see I'm caught in a trap
I can't find my way back
From this drinking life
Ain't nobody in their right mind
Oh, she carry on the way I do, yeah
Right now, oh right now
Ain't no better way to drive away the blues, oh yes
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So buy me a drink, yes
I'll sing you my song
And this night will be over
Just before too long
Caught in a trap
There just ain't no way back
From this drinking life
From this here, this drinking life
