Tick tick tock goes the clock
Hear my guitar roll down the block
Two, three, four
Bring it to my door
Come on in here
We'll rock some more
Let it rock
Yeah, let it rock
Let it roll
Then come on in and rock some more
Love the way you rock that
Makes me wanna go bang, bang, bang
Seven, eight, nine, you're lookin' so fine
Come on in here, let's have a time
Let it rock, yeah, let it rock
Let it roll, then come on in and rock some more
Let it roll like thunder
Love the way you rock down under
Seven, eight, nine, you're looking so fine
Come on over here we'll have a time
Let it rock
Let it rock
Let it roll
Then come on in and rock some more
Yeah, let it rock
Let it rock
Let it roll
Then come on and rock some more
Let it rock
Yeah, let it rock
