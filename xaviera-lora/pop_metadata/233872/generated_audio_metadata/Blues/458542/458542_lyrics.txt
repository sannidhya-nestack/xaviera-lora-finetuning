He still tells her that she's pretty
And his kiss comes right on cue
Still she knows that something's changed
When she asks him to explain
Well he says it's just blue
So she's trying to be perfect
And to disregard the clues
As long as he is staying
She'll believe in what he's saying
When he says it's just blues
She's so fearful of the day
When he'll come right out and say
That the sweet love they took for granted
Has faded away
So she chased to lay alone
As if nothing was wrong
But her heart is slowly breaking
And she can't pretend for long
She's softly weeping at the table
While he reads the morning news
When he finally glances at her
And says, "Darling, what's the matter?"
Well she says, "It's just the blues"
