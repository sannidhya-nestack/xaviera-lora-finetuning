Walking down the rails, trying to reach the light
Looking down the cliffs, shining blue in my mind
Should I walk through, into the light
Should I mix, black and blue tonight
So dark
I find it so confusing to fall back
Into dark thoughts in black
Changes all my thinking leaves a gap
In my soul
Black and blue
Takes the thoughts back to you
And I don't know what to do
Fall into blue
Blue and black
Walking on the wrong track
Trying to find the way back
Fall into black
Trying to sail out
But there's no wind anymore
What's a day about
If I sleep on the floor
Should I follow
The two metal lines
Should I mix
Like I'm blue tonight
So dark
I find it so confusing to fall back
Into dark thoughts and black
Changes all my thinking leaves a gap
In my song
Black and blue
Takes my thoughts back to you
And I don't know what to do
Fall into blue
Blue and black, walking on the wrong track
Trying to find the way back, walk into black
So take me back
Before I fall into the black
So walk me home
Before the night gets me alone
Black and blue, black and blue
Black and blue, black and blue
Black and blue, black and blue
Black and blue
