Tomorrow is another day
Another chance to walk away
A hand that protected you
Beat you to black and blue
You don't have to live like that
You don't ever have to go back
Every scream that haunts your dreams
Every wound that goes unseen
Every cry that feels unheard
I'll be there
Every hand that turns away
Every night you kneel to pray
I just wanna let you know
I'll be there
I'll be there for you
You wonder how we got this far
You wonder where did this all start
Your heart's grown too numb to feel
And it seems like you won't ever heal
You don't have to say a word
Cause I already know you're hurt
Every scream that haunts your dreams
Every wound that goes unseen
Every cry that feels unheard
I'll be there
Every hair that turns away
Every night you kneel to pray
I just wanna let you know
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
Every scream that haunts your dreams
Every wound that goes unseen
Every cry that feels unheard
I'll be there
Every head that turns away
Every night you kneel to pray
I just wanna let you know
I'll be there for you
