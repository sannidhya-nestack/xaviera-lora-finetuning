We kiss in French, I
Think we left the country in this bed, I
Drunk off these endorphins in my head, I
Know they're gonna wear off in the morning
I stress in English
You just want my body but I wish
You would really want me and get jealous
When I'm the apple of some other eye
Oh, why make up all these reasons why you never put me first?
I shouldn't have to tell you
My body is a temple, baby, I'm a goddess
We both know I'm special, let's start being honest
Boy, you're just a peasant playing with a prophet
Rolling in my stars and straight around you often
If you don't get me lovely
I need to feel lovely
Lovely
I need to feel lovely
We kiss in French but
When you speak the language ain't romantic
Take me like a child and not the good stuff
You know I'm gonna wear off in the morning
Oh, I like to think I'm strong, but
Every time you call, I'm in your arms'cause
You're touching me and suddenly I'm eous
Feeling myself gets me way too high
My body is a temple, baby, I'm a goddess
Roll you in my stars, then straight I'll write you off
And if you don't get me lovely
I need to feel lovely
Lovely
I need to feel lovely
You just wanna touch me
I just wanna, you just wanna, I wanna feel something
You just wanna fuck me
I just wanna, you just wanna, I wanna feel lovely
You just wanna, I just wanna, you just wanna fuck me
I just wanna, you just wanna, I wanna feel lovely
Lovely
I need to feel lovely, ooh, lovely
I need to feel lovely
