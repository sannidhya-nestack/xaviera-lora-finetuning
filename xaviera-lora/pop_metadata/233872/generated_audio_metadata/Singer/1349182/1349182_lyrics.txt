When I first met you things hadn't been going right
But you came along and turned color from black and white
I used to write my songs from the place of a broken heart
But that pattern changed and I knew it from the start
Now time has passed and we've had a life together
We had our share of hard times and storms
We've had to weather but even through life changes
The feeling grows everyday because you're in my life
This is what I say I don't have to try
I don't have to lie you are the reason
You're my reason why I don't have to cry
I don't have to say goodbye
You are the reason, you're my reason why
And I don't have to try, I don't have to lie
You are the reason, you're my reason why
I don't have to cry, I don't have to say goodbye
You are the reason
You're my reason why
You are the reason
