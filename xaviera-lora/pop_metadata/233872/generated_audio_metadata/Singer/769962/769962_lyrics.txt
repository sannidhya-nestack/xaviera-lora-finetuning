Yesterday seems so far away from this place we call today
Hey, it's a day
But I'm alright if you're okay
After all it was just a game
And you won
I know it's all about getting back up
But you say you never felt in the first place
And now it's all so clear to me
But I could be wrong
I hope I'm wrong
it was the first day I felt alive
And it's strange how it seems like a dream that night
