Now and then I travel through time
On a memory lane somewhere deep in my mind
And I gaze at the street where I first realized
And saw in your eyes you were different somehow
Oh, I wanna be the light
That comforts you at night
If you need to hear my voice
Love, just call on me
Oh, I wanna be the light
If you ever feel a stray
Down and out
Call me in loud
I spent so much time
Thinking what I should have said
Didn't get through your head
There's too much to leave behind or that you're always on my mind
There's still time but I was so blind
Oh I wanna be the light
That comforts you at night
If you need to hear my voice
Love just call on me
Oh I wanna be the ice
See through all the lines if you ever feel a stray
Down and out
Call me loud
I will always be there
