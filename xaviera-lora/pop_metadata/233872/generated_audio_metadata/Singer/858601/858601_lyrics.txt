Carrie's dad was an old money guy
Worked for a place too big to fail
Sometimes he wishes he had a little more
Of those things that aren't for sale
And we watch the jester at play in his court
With cunning tricks up his sleeve
And by the end of scene two
He's down on his knees
Something's going down around us
Something's going down around us
Well Ron had doubts once in a while
Was there more that he could have done?
He lights a candle for Holly each June
Sometimes he thinks she might have been the one
Well we're laughing at our own jokes
As rain collects into tears
Always waiting for tomorrow
Missing what's here
Well something going down around us
Well the wind keeps blowing down around us
And we barely even notice
All the changes in the air
But will you just go down around us
I've taken the fall and used the bait
Will and I eat, you can take me a fix
On my dad, let's end this
John is not as young as he once was
Seen friends who'd gotten it all
Losing it's taking it's toll on some
The bigger have farther to fall
We're still waiting for the moment
When the planets all collide
And life cracks open
Tomorrow spills out from inside
Well something's going down around us
Oh there's something going down around us
We're in a breakdown
Down around us
Shakedown
Down around us
A breakdown
Down around us
I break down, down around us
Shake down, down around us
Baby, down around us
