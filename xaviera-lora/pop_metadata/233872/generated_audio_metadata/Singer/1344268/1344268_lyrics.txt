Whenever you call, I'll be there
Anytime, anywhere at all
All you need to do is call
Play our song on repeat
Until we have a chance to meet
Just to talk or take a walk
We don't really need a reason
Anytime of the season, spring or fall
All you need to do is call
And I'll be there for you
Anytime
We may not agree, but you are still a friend to me that I'll always need
And these words you can't believe, I may not be the perfect friend
I will have your back until the end of time
And I know that you'll have mine
We may have different views
But it's still alright to choose our own side
You have yours and I'll have mine
And
Anytime
Every time you call
Anytime you call
I will be there
Anytime will you call
And you know, and you know, and you know I'll be there
I'll be there
And you know, and you know, and you know I'll be there
'Cause we all need someone
But I'll be there for you
That's how it's meant to be
From me to you
To everybody
Each time I look
All you need to do is call
Every time you call
All you need to do is call (anytime you call)
I will be there (all you need to do is call) (everytime you call)
I will be there if you call (I will be there if you call)
Count on me (I will be there if you call)
Count on me
I'll be there
Just call me
Just call
