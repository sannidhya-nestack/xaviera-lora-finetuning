I'm on the first train
I'm leaving this town
But it's worth the pain
Of leaving you again
Not half as bad
As yesterday's anticipation
I know I'll be there
I got
One chance to figure it out
We got one life to make it count
When we're far away (so far)
We'll take it back to when we first met
Far away
When I'm too far away (I feel so far away)
You kiss just like our first and last time
Far away, hey, hey
I feel so far away
A tear's enough to fill the ocean in my mind
And memory, I need to stay
On my knees I pray
I got one chance to figure it out
We got one life to make it count
When we're far away (so far)
We'll take it back to when we first met
Far away
When I'm too far away (so far away)
You kiss just like our first and last time far away, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (so far away)
When we're far away (so far away)
We'll take it back to when we first met
Far away (so far away)
When I'm too far away (I feel so far away)
You're just like our first and last time far away (I feel so far away)
