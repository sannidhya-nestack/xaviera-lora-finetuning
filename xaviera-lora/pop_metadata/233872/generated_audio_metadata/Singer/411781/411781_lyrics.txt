Wasting your time
Building your walls
Every time you try
And every time you fall
In the end you'll find
That you have lost it all
And what for?
If you want to run
Just choose where to go
All the roads are there
Don't try to take them all
In the end you'll find
That you have lost your soul
And what for?
Yes, what for?
In the end of it all
You are losing control
Every time you're trying to build your walls
You are losing your soul, in the end of it all
Every empire seems to be so small
Tell me why you are fading away and believe
You'll be heroes someday
While you're losing the time of your life
While you're losing the time of your life
