I love you
If I hurt you
Well it pains me
Don't wanna do that to you
I love you
If I act like a fool
Flowers and cards
Don't make it up to you
Even I can't see why I'd drive you crazy
You know me, I can't be emotionally lazy
I love you
I confused you
The stupid words I said
Bounce around in your head
I love you
I need you
You're the air I breathe
You know that I'll never leave
Even I can't see why I drive you crazy
I know what you want me to be
Well I'm trying to get there baby
Play it, man
Think of me as two very different people
Want to leave behind
Now I better want to find
It's not so crazy
Carry these burdens we must
It's all worth it I trust
In the end I love you
I love you
Like crazy
