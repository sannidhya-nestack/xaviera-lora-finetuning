Ariana, I have seen you each night as I sleep
I remember how the sight of you made my heart leap
I long to touch your fair hair
I offer a silent prayer to see you again
I still hear you, the trees seem to whisper your name
And my fingers recall the heat of your flame
I sense you wherever I go
My soul nearly overflows when I think of you
Oh, Ariana, why did you leave?
A life spent without you I cannot conceive
Ariana, I still hear your voice in my heart
I am bitter, that fate cruelly tore us apart
Nothing can dampen the pain
Only my memories remain
I hold each one dear
