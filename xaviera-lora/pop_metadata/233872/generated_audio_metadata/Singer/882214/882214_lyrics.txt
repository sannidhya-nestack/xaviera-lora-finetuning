I left you stranded by the gas station line
You weren't looking and I left you behind
And I drove down the highway
Dynamite in my shoes
Yeah I drove down the highway
Whispering my love to you
Landed on time in Montreal
You picked me up in your Volkswagen small
And we drove into the city
And everything was new
And I went to Toronto and I waited for you
We packed up your minis so tight
And we drove across the country day and night
And we stopped in the Black Hills
Both always wanted to see
The mountains in Chicago and you showed me the Mississippi
We are love travelers, love travelers, yeah
We are love travelers, love travelers, yeah
And I'm still clinging to a chance
I'm still clinging to that one luggage tank
Landed late in London town
It was so nice having you around
And we parked our bags
And we headed for the big bend
We made a sign at Victoria Station
To try and find my cousin
And of course we got high in Amsterdam
And you took that great picture by the garden stand
And we had the best ice cream that was ever made
Pushed past that dirty district to go find some clean place to misbehave
We love travelers, love travelers yeah
We love travelers, love travelers, yeah
And I'm still clinging to a chance
I'm still clinging to that one luggage tag
That train keeps rolling, that train keeps rolling around
That train keeps rolling, rolling from town to town
That train keeps rolling, rolling, making that sound
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I left you stranded by the gas station line
You weren't looking and I left you behind
And I drove down the highway
Dynamite in my shoes
