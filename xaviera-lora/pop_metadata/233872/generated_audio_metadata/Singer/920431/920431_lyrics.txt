Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tell me how we fail to encumber every moment
With the inevitable future standing in our way
Tell me how we don't fall beneath the weight
Of the heavy darkness that keeps us in the fray
I will see somewhere on the other side
There will be an answer for the tears we cried
Every single moment that was taken away
We'll be made up
Making up for lost time
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Last night I had a dream
You were in my arms
I was still a child
Safely on ground
Emerging from my sleep
I slowly realized
Now I am an old man
Your life was flying by
I will see you somewhere on the other side
There will be an answer for the tears we cried
Every single moment that was taken away will be made up
Make it up for lost time
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The winner of the mountain pass
To seek until I find and last
Kind love and peace
Of only dreams
I will see you somewhere on the other side
There will be an answer for the tears we cried
Every single moment that was taken away
Will be made up, make it up for lost time
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
