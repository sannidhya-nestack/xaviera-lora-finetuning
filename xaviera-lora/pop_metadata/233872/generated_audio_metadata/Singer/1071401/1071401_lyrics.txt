With me, with me
Let your own light shine
Like a lightning bug
So that you can always
See the path to love
No you don't need the North Star
To steer you towards the right
Yeah you can be the light
Or maybe someone told you
That it really isn't cool
To sing your little heart out
Or be the smartest one in school
Well could this be your moment
A chance to change their mind
Yeah you could be the light
And when the morning comes
You could be the sun
Rising on the dark side of the moon
A candle in the storm
Yeah, you could be the one
Glowing in somebody's living room
Well, there's a darkness hiding
In every town, everywhere
Some folks when they see it
They pretend it isn't there
If no one else is strong enough
To stand up for what's right
Hey you
Be the light
It's time to show the whole world who you are
Stars were born to shine
Yeah, you can be the light
(Whistling)
