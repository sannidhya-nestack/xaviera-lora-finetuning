Tell me there's no love
And I will stop to cry
Tell me there's no hope
So I can stop to try
Remember me one day
Before your memories fade
You wouldn't recognize
The face you left behind
I think it's fair to say
That through your thin disguise
You really didn't care
It was always in your eyes
But I love you still
And I always will
You had me so confused
Cause every time I lose
So as my life slows down
To a melancholy blues
I won't be moving on
every time I lose
I took that bittersweet
And filled a case of wine
You had me at your feet
But you were never mine
You're still and I always will
You had me so confused
every time I lose
But I love you still (but I love you still) and I always will (and I always will)
You know I pay my dues (you know I pay my dues) but every time I lose
Every time I lose (but I love you still)
Every time I lose
Every time I lose
Every time I lose
