Everybody loves you now
But I'm the only one who knows how
Though you change like the weather
Fly away
Like a feather
But I like you like that
Like you like that
Baby don't go changing please
'Cause I like you like that, like you like that
Baby, don't go changing
All the silly things you say
To make those people look our way
They might think that we're crazy
But I don't mind
Cause you're my lady
And I like you like that
I like you like that
Baby, don't go changing, please
I like you like that
I like you like that
Baby, don't go changing
Baby don't go changing, please
I like you like that
I like you like that
Baby, don't go changing, please
I like you like that
Like you like that
Baby, don't go changing
Baby, don't go changing
Baby, don't go changing
