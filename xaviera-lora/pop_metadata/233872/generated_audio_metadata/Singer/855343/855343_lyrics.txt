Running from yourself
You're a scared little child
And you're so full of dreams
So full of denial
And you're never quite sure
You do the right thing
Are you following your gut
Or running from a diamond ring?
But you made a choice, you had a song to sing
And you cut the cord of love, and it still stings
There you are again, sweet, out for me
Took the lead from my heart and you gave me the melody
Stay with me my sweet alchemy
Oh oh oh
But you paid the price
Maybe a little too dear
And you can't swim back
On a river full of tears
And the wild rose won't die
In the garden of your heart
It's frozen in time
Too painful to part
There you are again, sweet alchemy
You took the lead from my heart and you gave me a melody
Stay with me, my sweet alchemy
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, there you are again sweet alchemy
Took the lead from my heart and you gave me a melody
Stay with me my sweet harmony
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
