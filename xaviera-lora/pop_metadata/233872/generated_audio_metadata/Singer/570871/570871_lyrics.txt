Newspaper made your success, your face is a peach and your life it's a mess that's the story, rags to glory
And people believe what they say
You signed on a line then you learned how to play it was easy
And people believe anything
Your top of the pop said you can't even sing it's so easy
It can't be that easy
Oh man that's too easy
Brought to your knees by tabloid sleaze
They're laughing at you
And kale surprise
Their stinking lies were true
You'll find no place in the real world for a dreamer
There's no safe place in the real world for a dreamer
