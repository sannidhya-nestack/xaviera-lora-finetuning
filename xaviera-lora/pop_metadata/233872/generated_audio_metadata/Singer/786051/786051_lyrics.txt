This is not the song I thought I'd write for you
I had so many colors but now there's only blue
And it seems you have changed in so many ways
So go on, run away, deny your pain
But I hope you'll see me as I am
When your words do shine
With thoughts that are your own
They just may take you to a place you'd never be
And then I hope you'll see me as I am
This was not supposed to end this way with you
We had so much love to share
So much we won't get to do
And why have I been damned to dream of only you?
When I gave you all I had
When I gave you my truth
I'd hoped you'd see me as I am
'Cause there is so much more to this
You need to make your stand
And try to see the person that you are
And wanna be
And when you do
You'll see me as I am
And if you look real hard, you might just understand
That this is not about me, but you and who you are
