Sleeping in a house I used to live in
Laying on a couch that used to be mine
Working on a dream, I'm working on a dream of mine
There's ghosts in the pantry and ghosts in the walls
Shooting out the lights and calling on the phone
They're ringing in my ears, crawling on my skin
Shaking and rattling my bones
When I'm working on a dream, working on a dream that's my own
Can you remember the loneliest moment in your life
Can you remember the loneliest moment in your life
Well everybody gotta die alone
Well everybody gotta die alone
But there ain't no way to live
There ain't no way to live
Everybody gotta die alone
Can you remember
The loneliest moments in your life?
Can you remember
The loneliest moment in your life
Stumbled around a house I used to live in
Looking for a key that used to be mine
There's an owl in the tree
Owl in the tree outside
Singing, working on a dream, working on a dream of mine
Singing, working on a dream, working on a dream of mine
Singing, working on a dream, working on a dream of mine
