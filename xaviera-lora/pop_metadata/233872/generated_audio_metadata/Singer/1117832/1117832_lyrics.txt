I swallow my pride
To get on the right side of you
I keep on smiling darling
I look on the bright side for you
I'd tango my life
To stay on the nice side of you
I say what you wanna hear
I'm always so good for you
You know it's true
But I'd cry
Ooh, I'd cry
I'd cry
But I'd cry
Ooh, you used to bring me joy, girl
But now I'm just pretending
I'm faking all I really ever do
I know it's ending, yes I do
But I still try to be perfect every day in every way
Just like you want me to
And I'm holding it together
Just as much as I can
Who are you?
But I'd cry, I'd cry, I'd cry, I'd cry
You don't even notice when I'm lying to you
You never look into my eyes anymore
But don't misunderstand me
Or look so disappointed
I ain't pretending like before
But I cry
I cry, well I cry, well I cry
Well I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry
