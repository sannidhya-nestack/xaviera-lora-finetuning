When you're hurt
Tattered with feathered bare
Black growth, tethered sail
When you're hurt
Count the minutes
I was trusting so blind
Ain't no peace in your mind when you're hurt
I was paralyzed by those city lights (by those city lights)
Now I'm letting go
To the center line
On your lips tonight
There's another line
On your lips tonight
There's another line
When you're searching (when you're searching)
And there's no answer inside (no answer inside)
There's no end to this fight (no end to this fight)
When you're searching (when you're searching)
Close the curtain
I'm crossing those lines (crossing those lines)
Between the truth and the lies
'Cause I'm a,'cause I'm a
I'm on the lies and curves
Of these city lights (of these city lights)
Oh, I'm letting go (I'm letting go)
To another life (to another life)
On my lips tonight
There's another lie (on my lips tonight) on my lips tonight
There's another lie on my lips tonight
There's another eye (on my lips tonight)
On my lips tonight
There's another eye (on my lips tonight)
On my lips tonight
There's another eye (on my lips tonight)
On my lips tonight
There's another eye (on my lips tonight)
On my lips tonight
There's another eye (on my lips tonight)
On my lips tonight
