I heard your love is gone, you said you wouldn't cry
You promised you'd be strong, you promised you'd be fine
Feels like a starless night with many shadows
Still life, the ending of a dream
I know your faith is bigger than the dark tonight
I know you're gonna make it through the fire alright
Stronger than before
Things are gonna change, the pain will go away
It might take a while, I promise it won't stay
Oh how we kill ourselves for understanding
Oh how it's never good enough
I know your faith is bigger than the dark tonight
I know you're gonna make it through the fire, alright
Stronger than before
I know your faith is bigger than the dark
Tonight
I know you're gonna make it through the fire
Alright
Stronger than before
Stronger than before
