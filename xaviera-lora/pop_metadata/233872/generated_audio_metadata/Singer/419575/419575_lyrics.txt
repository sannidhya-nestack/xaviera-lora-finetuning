Woke up about noon on a Saturday
Just in time to see you take that flight away
Something about you're gonna travel the world to grow
I nod my head and say softly I know
So off you go don't you et to write
Baby let me know sometime you made it alright
This streets, the buildings, the sky, the people here are grey
I'm trying to find something nice about it all today
A thousand thoughts about what I could say
But I'm not so good at making sense of all this I must say
A sound old man with a smile on his face
He said don't you worry boy it comes around least twice anyway
And it's alright, it's okay
Ten thousand miles ain't that far away
It's alright, it's okay
Nothing tequila can take away
It's alright, it's okay
But I'd rather be there with you then
Came back around to it on Sunday
You can only think so much anyway
Something about time I et what it is they say
And now it's gone it seems like just yesterday
So here I go with a song to finally say
I hope you made it alright and you're smiling today
It's alright, it's okay
Ten thousand miles ain't that far away
It's alright, it's okay
Nothing tequila can take away
It's alright, it's okay
But I'd rather be there with you than stay
Yeah it's alright, it's okay
But I'd rather be there with you than
