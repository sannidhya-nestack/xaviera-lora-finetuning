I'm dreaming of a dream inside a dream about a dream
Completely unaware unconscious dreams are all they mean
I'm bending time and space and turning buildings upside down
Reflecting mirrors of the world to help spin time around
Total control, I play my role, I rule this universe
Enjoying spontaneity, completely unrehearsed
Toys of youth go round and round, imagining their past
Whispering sweet whipperwheels upon the hilliers mast
Pinwheel schemes of childhood dreams
Blessings in disguise
Floating through the labyrinth
Confessed before my eyes
Deeper, deeper, well beyond
Detour round the lies
Pinwheel schemes of childhood dreams
Blessings in disguise
She's calling and she's calling and she's trapped inside my mind
I'm bawling and I'm bawling from the guilt she left behind
Deeper, going deeper to the fabric of the wound
Never will I solve this conflict, none too soon
Pinwheel schemes of childhood dreams
With blessings in disguise
Floating through the labyrinth
Confessed before my eyes
Deeper, deeper, well beyond
Deep to around the lies
Pinwheel schemes of childhood dreams
Were blessings in disguise
I'm not here to dream a dream
I'm just here to wake up
I turn my focus deep inside
Press rewind then back up
Pinwheel schemes of childhood dreams
With blessings in disguise
Floating through the labyrinth
And fest before my eyes
Yeah, deeper, deeper, well beyond
Deep to around the lies
Pinwheel schemes of childhood dreams
Blessings in disguise, blessings in disguise
Those pinwheel schemes
Of childhood dreams
