Your silver hair unbalancing
Drifts in and out and it's cold again
This drought of dreams
So paper thin
A whisper away
And you're gone again
And you touch my skin like dry rain
The dry rain supplements
And I cross that line but you're gone again
Like dry rain, evaporate, mmm, mmm, my prowess
Feels powerless, I can't explain this hooker reign
And I still pretend you're part of me
But tears won't fall without gravity
And you soak my skin like dry rain
But dry rain
Supplements and you cross that line but fall back again
Like dry rain, you evaporate like dry rain
I pray, mmm, mmm
