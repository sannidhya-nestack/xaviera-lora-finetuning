I watch the rain trickling down the window pane
I watch it fall and disappear
Outside the world is cold and inner whirl
I'm so glad that I'm in here
Here in England in the summertime
I just like to rest my pain
Here in England in the summertime
I just sit and watch the rain
I like to sit and watch the rain
I hear the sounds as children play
I hear the footsteps fade away
I play the part
It's not false, it's not art
It's just the way I feel today
Here in England in the summertime
I just like to rest my pain
Here at England in the summertime
I just sit and watch the rain
I like to sit and watch the rain
