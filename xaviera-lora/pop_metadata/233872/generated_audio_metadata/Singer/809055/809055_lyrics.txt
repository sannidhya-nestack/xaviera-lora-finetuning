Listen to the sound of your words in my ears
Conditions
When you tell me how it has to be again and again and again
I can't go on
Pretending how we truly have it all
I never thought we'd be the ones to fall
This missing piece
Is everything you want
Is this how it is?
Is this who we are?
Will this be the thing that will drive us apart?
I cannot give this to you
I don't want this
Don't make me do this
You know I'd give you everything
But please don't ask me this
Don't ask me this
Confessions
It's time that we speak the truth
If one of us will win the other loses
And every day takes me further
This is how it is, this is who we are
This is the thing that will tear us apart
I cannot give this to you
I don't
Don't want this, don't make me do this
I gave you everything I had so please don't ask me this
Don't ask me this
Every year that passes by has held us down
All our dreams have slipped through our hands
With promises to hope for and everything to lose
So why do you make me choose?
'Cause I don't want this
Don't make me do this
You've taken every dream I have
So please don't ask me this
Don't ask,'cause I can't do this
Don't make me go through this
There's nothing left I have to give
So please don't ask me this
Don't ask me this
