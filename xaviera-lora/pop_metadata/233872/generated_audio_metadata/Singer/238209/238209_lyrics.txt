I knew you, but didn't
To touch you, I couldn't
You were there, but hidden
Dreamed of you, a whole lot
In'79, I saw those eyes
So captivated, so divine
Finally won with no lies
I saw true love in your eyes
In my eyes so divine
In my eyes so divine
In your lips sweet as wine
In your lips sweet as wine
And there were each of us
Before there were two of us
Knowing love was our plus
Still there was each of us
And early on life was unkind
They said often the love will unwind
And through it all we hung tough
'Cause our love was enough
And the years, they drifted by
We married, then a surprise
A little one, my oh my
Saw our love
In her eyes, in my eyes, so divine
In my eyes, so divine
And your lips, sweet as wine
And your lips, sweet as wine
Then there were three of us
Then there were four of us
All because two of us
All because each of us
All because each of us
All because each of us
All because each of us
