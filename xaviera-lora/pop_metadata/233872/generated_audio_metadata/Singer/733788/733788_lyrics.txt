A rock struck my window
I awoke to the street lights glow
And you're standing down below
Baby I'm still the same
It was always in the rain
You were drunk and a little insane
But I always let you in
Baby I'm still the same
The wind blows the hanging door
Our clothes scattered on the floor
We never talked at all
Baby I'm still the same
Baby I'm still the same
You won't come around
No you won't come around
Is it over?
Baby I'm still the same
You won't come around
No you won't come around
Is it over?
Tell me it's not over tonight
A volcano covered in snow
There was a hurt that you didn't show
You laughed away the tears
Baby I'm still the same
There are shadows in my brain
The ghost of electricity remains
Light buzzing in the dark
Baby I'm still the same
Underneath I always knew
Despite the pictures my mind drew
The past you can't renew
Baby I'm still the same
Baby I'm still the same
She won't come around
No, you won't come around
Is it over?
Baby, I'm still the same
But you won't come around
You won't come around
Is it over?
Tell me it's not over tonight
The beggar in my heart
Began to hope and plead
His hands are full of rain
Baby I'm still the same
I can't help but think of you
And I hope you remember too
What we had was something real
It's a restless memory
And so many things have changed
But baby I'm still the same
