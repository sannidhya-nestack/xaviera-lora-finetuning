Wake up, my love, we have a big day in store
Uncharted trails ahead, come on, let's make the bed, please, we need
Seeking fools' gold
Day breaks before it unfolds
Sunrise creeps up on the cold
The light sings as if to console
So please
Seeking fools gold
Follow me love
To a river of dreams
Where treasures do await
Every stone of potential fate
Graciously there to take, keep, or turn away
To shine another day
The secret yearns to be told
Humbly grateful we go
Water is wine when we're open to behold
Seeking fools' gold
Stone walls do not apprise a man
Nor iron bars a cage
If it shines, let it shine
This is how we shine
Lay down my love
We had a big day today
Hanging on by a thread
Come on you sleepy head
Sam's on his way
Let shine another day
Dusk falls, reposing our souls
Darkness of night will take hold
The owl howls as if to console
For in the morning we will go
Seeking fools' gold
