I guess I've been a fool
Afraid to really try
To find a love that always passed me by
But now I know the truth
That I could never see
'Cause all this time I never knew love starts with me
But now I'm not so sure what I was living for
Give me half a chance, I'll show you that I can
And in time you will see
The love inside of me
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
I'll take it from the top
And give more than I take
And fill the world with all the love that I make
With every single day my heart will start up new
To be a light of love to shine on you
It's easy now I see
What love will do for me
Give me half a chance
I'll show you that I can
And in time you will see
The love inside of me
And in time you will see
The love inside of me
Yes, in time you will see
The love inside of me
In time you will see
The love inside of me
