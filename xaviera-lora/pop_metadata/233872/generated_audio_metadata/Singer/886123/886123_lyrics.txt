Nice to meet you, nice to meet you too
I like your shirt, I like your smile
But now I'm looking at your shoes below
Something doesn't approve
I'm sorry, I just judged you
Did you say that? Yeah, I think you did
You judge someone out loud
But now I'm no better
in my mind I criticize
I'm sorry, I just judged you
That's not the way that I want to be, honestly
It's not the way that I want to be
what I really want is love, oh sweet love
And when I'm in a crowd of strangers
I'm familiar and I know
My defensive radar is buzzin'
When you speak it starts to hone
I'm sorry I just judged you
That's not the way that I want to be, honestly
It's not the way that I want to be
what I really want is love, oh sweet love
I really really really want love, oh sweet love
And all these people in front of me
Reflections of myself
Warped reality but it's all untrue
Views of me and you
Muddy projections
Going on and on
I really, really, really want love, oh sweet love
I really, really, really want love, oh sweet love
Every day I want love, oh sweet love
Nice to meet you, nice to meet you too
