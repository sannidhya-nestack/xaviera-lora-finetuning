From the white cliffs of Dover
Calling out across the sea
I'm sending my immortal sonnet
And pray it finds you happily
The northern winds are cold
I know the storm keeps raging on
From the white cliffs of Dover
Sailor me of the tower
From the green fields of Galway
To the valleys all around
I'm sending my immortal sonnet
And pray it finds you safe and sound
The northern winds are cold
I know the storm keeps raging on
From the green fields of Galway
Shé lá mi áví tá
From the blue bay of Biscay
To the mountains of Nepal
I'm sending my immortal sonnet
And pray it finds you evermore
The northern winds are cold
I know the storm keeps raging on
From the blue bay of Bishke
Selamiya lija
From the red skies of G ia
In the first light of the dawn
I'm sending my immortal sonnet
And pray it finds you when you're gone
The northern winds are cold
I know the storm keeps raging on
From the red skies of G ia
C'est la mia vita
From the black hole in my heart
From the depths of my despair
I'm sending my immortal sonnet
And pray it finds you anywhere
The northern wind is cold
I know the storm keeps raging on
I'm hoping my immortal sonnet
Will find you there
And find you well
Anywhere you are, ah
