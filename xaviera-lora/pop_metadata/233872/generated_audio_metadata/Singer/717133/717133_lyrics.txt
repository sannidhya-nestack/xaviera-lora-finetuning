My tired blue love
Close your eyes, we will rise above
Fallen angel in your faded gown
With me sleeping on your garden ground
Right by
Your side
Let go
Let go
Lead me again
My leaving friend
Glue me lips upon a saffron face
Send me reeling in your velvet space
I rise, soul flies
Let go, let go
Your worried brow
Things have changed
We are strangers now
All the holes we tried to fill with love
Still our remedy it was not enough
We tried
Goodbye
Leave over
Leave over
