She stares out through the window
He keeps glancing at the clock
He knows there's not much time left
He sings hey hey la la la
Long gone battles on the run
When those two had just begun
Radio waves in the sky
They're singing bye, bye American bye
I don't know why
I don't know why
And they danced to radio sounds
Always made the best of what's around
when you're in love that's how it goes
Sacrifice until it grows
She won't tell what's the last hurrah
Feels every bit as good as Shangri-La
And as the rain began to fall
The radio echoed through the wall
Now we know why
Now we know why
Time was on their side
It's rare that two like that should collide
And all the changes they went through
The music and the love were the glue
And they always loved to dance
Spin around the boat until it dreads
All that they need was in that room
It was spring and then it blew
Now we know why
Now we know why
