I don't know where it ends
My music has never felt so bad
Closed down for sale
It has no chance to be played loud in the air
And winter comes here to freeze bodies and souls and energy
It makes me see the cage I'm in should be automatic to be free
Ten dead songs and nobody knows but me
Ten dead songs and nobody moves but me
When all is pornography
You kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill, kill
Mayday, I'm gonna crack
You find my pieces on the ground
Sad memories I left
They're here to hurt again
And I can feel the cage I'm in
It should be automatic to be free
Ten dead songs that nobody knows but me
Ten dead songs that nobody moans but me
If this was pornography
And you get one more damn song
But I'm not pornography
You kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
All you have just killed, killed, killed, killed, killed
