I thought I was supposed to be alone
But when you entered the room
My head started spinning like a wheel
So fast I couldn't breathe
It made me wonder
It made me wonder
Why have you waited for so long
I was almost dead and gone
Waiting for your love
Love, come on
Oh it's so cool to act like a teenager
When you are thirty years old
You're bringing back the youth
It makes me wonder why have you
For so long
I was almost dead and gone
Waiting for your love
Love
Come on
Come on, come on, come on
