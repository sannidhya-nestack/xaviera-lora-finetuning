To think the night before you were born up in New Haven
The feeling in my soul that day I can't explain it
And when we moved to Austin, Texas you had grown
Into such a fine young boy
You became my best friend
And only three years later in a town near Cincinnati
The sweetest little girl in all of earth and heaven
Came into this world down in the foothills of Kentucky
And that sparkle in her smile
Could make a grown man cry
And I love you no matter how far we're apart
And I miss you so much it's tearing at my heart
But I know you'll be okay and I'll think of you each day
And I hope you won't et that I'm your daddy
Your new home in Rhode Island will bring happiness and friends
In places that you've never been before
But please remember that I'm up here in New Hampshire all alone
But you'll never be too far
From all the love we've known
And I love you no matter how far we're apart
And I miss you so much it's tearing at my heart
But I know you'll be okay and I'll think of you each day
And I hope you won't et that I'm your daddy
So lay your sleepy head down on your pillow safe and warm
And dream about the many things that make you happy
And I will lay my head down on my pillow safe and warm
And as I drift to sleep I will dream of you
And I love you no matter how far we're apart
And I miss you so much it's tearing at my heart
But I know you'll be okay and I'll think of you each day
And I hope you won't et that I'm your daddy
