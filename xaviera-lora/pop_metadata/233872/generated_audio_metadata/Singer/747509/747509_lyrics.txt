I can't believe just how hard it has been
The time in our lives tried to bring us down
The music playing's on as we're singing our song
Until the end, my dearest friend
Last night I cried as angels fell from skies unbeknownst to you
I care, I care, I care the music plays on
As we're singing our song
Until the end
My dearest friend
We slip, we fall
We will rise above it all
We'll glide, we'll float
To the rhythm
And when we walk up on high
We will always reach the sky
We'll glide, we'll float to the rhythm
I love you, I do
The prince of vanity, as the sky is lighting up
I'll leave you my friend, with things you've got to make
The music plays on, as we sing our song until the end
My dearest friend
We slip, we fall
We will rise above it all
We'll glide, we'll float
To the rhythm
And we walk, we fall high
We will always reach the sky
We'll glide, we'll float
To the rhythm
Once in a while
I'm watching you smile
And unbeknownst to you
I can see right through
Behind it all
Is the strength of it all
And until the end
I will still be your friend
I will
I will
And we tip, we fall
We will rise above it all
We'll glide, we'll float to the rhythm
And we walk up on high
We will always reach the sky
We'll glide, we'll float to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
I love you
