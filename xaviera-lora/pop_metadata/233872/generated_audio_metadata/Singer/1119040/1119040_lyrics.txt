Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Rustin' like a horseshoe
Livin' in a quiet town with you
There's no, there's no ticket out
Livin' in, livin' in a quiet town
Livin' in a quiet town with you
Rustin' red just like a horseshoe
Feels real, there's no clicker out
Kiss me out on the main street now
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Uptown wind blows
Like a band of seven in a highway
Uptown wind blows
Like a band of seven in a driveway
Four, five
Couldn't be happier
With a rose and wine just
Fine, happier than rosé wine
Out there on the main bare
So new, watch me in a band there
Sitting up, wrote a fire song
With a cameo from the day sun
There's no, there's no ticket out
This is what, this is what it's all about
Fast friends, quicker than a drive-through
Main street, hotter than a bull's tube
The uptown wind blows
Like a band of seven in a highway
The uptown wind blows
Like a band of seven in a driveway
For five
Couldn't be happier with rose wine just fine
Happier with rose wine
Happier with rose wine
Rusting like a horseshoe
Living in a quiet town with you
There's no, there's no ticket out
Living in, living in a quiet town
