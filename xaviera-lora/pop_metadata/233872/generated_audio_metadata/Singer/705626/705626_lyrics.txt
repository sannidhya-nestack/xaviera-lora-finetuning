I like to see the stars at night
I don't know why
I like it when you hold me tight
I don't know why
All that I know
Is that you make me feel so, so
you make me feel
So, so
I like to see the moon at night
I don't know why
I like it when I hold you tight
I don't know why
All that I know
Is that you make me feel so, so
you make me feel
So, so, I guess this is
What they call love
I guess this is
What they've been calling love
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Ooh
I guess this is
What they call love
I guess this is
What they call love
Oh, I guess this is what they've been calling love
