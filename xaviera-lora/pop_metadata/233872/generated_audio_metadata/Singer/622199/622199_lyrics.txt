And when you smile, smile at me
I can almost believe
Truly some things they're just meant to be
That you are the
One that loves me despite all my stuff
Love
Love is the gift
The gift we share
Love is love
And when we breathe each other's breath
You layin' your head on my chest
Life gives us these moments, I guess
And you are mine
Won't you love from the first kiss?
Love, love is the gift
The gift we share
Love is love
Your kiss, it's like heaven above
Your lips, yeah, sparking my love, sparking my love
And when we walk, walk side by side
The stars shining down from the sky
The twinkle that captures your eye
Tell me love
Angels above have all blessed this love
Love
Love is the gift
The gift we share
Love is love
