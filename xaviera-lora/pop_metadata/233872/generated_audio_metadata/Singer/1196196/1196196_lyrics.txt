Once you looked in my eyes
Said no more goodbyes
I was so naive
Lights went up and made me see
It was all fantasy
Cue the crowd stupid me
Now I know it's time to leave
All in for the lines and the stories you told
Everything that you said was just part of the role
You were the hero and I was the one to be saved
I've read the script, stopped the scene
No, I won't pretend to be something I'm not
I know how this ends
Life's not a movie
So cut to the fade
I won't be played
New scene fades in at my lips
Speaking brand new lines
In a different role, mm
Camera pans, it's a different day
Wounded, wiser, but I'm on my way
Now I am in control
My name up on the marquee
All in for the lines and the stories you told
Everything that you said was just part of the role
You were the hero and I was the one to be saved
Ooh
I've read the script, stopped the scene
No, I won't pretend
To be something I'm not
I know how this ends
Life's not a movie
So cut to the fade
Ooh, it's not my play
A brand new day
I'm on my way
Lights went up, now I see
The lines you sewed, the stories you told
The things you said, just part of your role
You weren't a hero, and I don't need to be saved
I've read the script, stopped the scene
No, I won't pretend
To be something I'm not
Cause we know how this ends
This is my movie
So cut to the fade
So cut to the fade
