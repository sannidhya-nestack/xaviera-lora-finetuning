Look and you'll find the love, look and you'll find the love (come on) look and you'll find the love (love, love, love, love, love, love)
We're coming from far away
Souls shaking to celebrate in a good way
With everyone if you're looking you'll find the love come on
We laugh, we cry, we share the ride on this blue planet
Ain't it more fun with peace and love and understanding
It don't run out nobody can buy it
It's all around, we need it, we'll find it (we'll find it)
Life is little things
But more than these moments
It's who you gonna share them with
We're coming from far away
So shake it to celebrate in a good way
With everyone if you're looking you'll find the love
Play on we're just grown up kids
New scene ready to begin in a good way
With everyone if you're looking you'll find the love
Looking you'll find the love
Look can you find the love
We live for the ones we love
Many things making us go wow
Give thanks when the song goes up
Get down when the stars come out
The greatest show I'm watching it with you
We got front row it's better than pictures
Life is little things
But more than these moments it's
Who you gonna share them with
We're coming from far away
So shake it to celebrate in a good way
With everyone if you're looking you'll find the love
Play up with just grown up kids
Do see ready to begin in a good way
With everyone if you're looking you'll find the love
Look and you'll find the love, look and you'll find the love, look and you'll find the love
