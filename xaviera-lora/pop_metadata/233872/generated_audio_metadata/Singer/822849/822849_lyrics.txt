The way you move girl I can't help but crack a smile
You play that jukebox like it's going out of style
It's getting late and you just ordered one more beer
I should probably get on home but I am just not thinking clear
You may think I'm just not worth it
But it couldn't hurt to try
And we better do it soon while we still have got the time
You may think I'm just a bum who's living off his daddy's dime
But I'd give it all away if I could say that you are mine
There's no surprise and see this happens every time
Your love is like a snake and you are wrapped around my mind
And you've given me your body and you've given me your time
Then you took them both away like you were running from a crime
You may think I'm just not worth it
But it couldn't hurt to try
And we better do it soon while we still have got the time
You may think I'm just a bum who's living off his daddy's dime
But I'd give it all away if I could say that you are mine
And I don't regret
A single thing that I said
And it may have been too soon
But something brought me here to you
And I don't expect
You to come on crawling back
I wish that I could play it cool
But I'm still waiting here for you
You may think I'm just not worth it
But I couldn't hurt to try
And we better do it soon while we still have got the time
You may think I'm just a bum who's living off his daddy's dime
But I'd give it all away if I could say that you are mine
Yes I'd give it all away if I could say that you are mine
Yes I'd give it all away if I could say that you are mine
