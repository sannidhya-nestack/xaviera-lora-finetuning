The days are getting shorter now and
Snow is falling down
The white obscures the noises all around
To sweet July we said goodbye
And splashing at the shore
Please come back before too long those
Sounds that I adore were
Sounds of summer
Call me from the darkness
On a winter night
Sounds of summer
Whisper in my ear
From the earth and sky
Sounds of summer
Sounds of summer
Ease my mind
The bell rings on the ice cream truck
Children drop their toys
For Beach Boy good vibrations to enjoy
A breeze floats by the wind chimes ring
I hear a screen door slam
Our lips meet with the softest touch oh
So much of who I am enough
Sounds of summer call me from the darkness
On a winter night
Sounds of summer whisper in my ear
From the earth and the sky
Sounds of summer
Sounds of summer ease my mind
