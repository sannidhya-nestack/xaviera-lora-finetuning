This song is about making decisions
We all understand that
Can I do the thing that you ask me?
Can I share this world anymore
I'll always love you
Can I search inside for an answer
Are my feelings pure anymore?
I'll always care for you
Stars often die, just explode in the sky
The sails of a ship need the wind to survive
As the sand slips away through the glass every day
Two souls that were never meant to be
Leave their prayers where they lay
Can I do this thing that you ask of me
Can I play this hand once again
I'll always love you
If I go please ive me
But when all is really said and done
I'll always care for you
Stars often die
Your sins float in the sky
The sails of the ship
Need the wind to survive
As the sand slips away
Through the glass every day
Two souls that were tied
Leave their prints where they
Can I do the thing that you ask of me?
Can I play this hand once again?
I'll always love you
No matter what the consequence, I'll always love you
