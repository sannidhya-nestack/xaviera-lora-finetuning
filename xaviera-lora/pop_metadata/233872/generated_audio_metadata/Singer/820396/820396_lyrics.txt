Don't be afraid of being yourself
Don't worry that I won't stay
Don't be afraid that I'll see who you really are
Don't worry that I'll walk away
I'm tired of one night stands
Of superficial hookups
Of bars where people go
To be someone they're not
I want a woman with a head on her shoulders
With a heart of gold
Not just someone who thinks she's hot
I want someone who's real
Inside and out
I'm not looking for candy on my arm
I want someone who's real through and through
Who's happy with who they are
I'm tired of looking for love
In all the wrong places
Self-medicating the pain
Until I no longer care
I need a woman who cultivates her inner beauty
Who inspires the best in me
In ways I never dared
I want someone who's ready to be serious
I want someone who's ready to think about us
About living together
And relationships are
About working and playing
Communicating enough
About laughing and loving
Sharing our dreams and fears when times are tough
I want someone who's real
Feeling inside and out
I'm not looking for candy on my arm
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't be afraid of being yourself
Don't worry that I won't stay
Don't be afraid that I'll see who you really are
Don't worry that I'll walk away
