Is it love if love doesn't hurt you?
Does it fly when the sun doesn't shine?
Are the roses redder than they've ever been?
Is the sky bluer than you have ever seen?
And it's on and on and on
Is it love now?
Is it love?
Is it love?
If love doesn't hurt you
Does it fly when the sun doesn't shine
Are the roses redder than they've ever been
Is the sky bluer
Than you have ever seen
And it's on and on and on
Is it love now?
Is it love now?
Never let your love fade away
It's a summer's day on a winter's night
Hold on, hold on
Never let it go
Never let her go
Can you tell when love sits beside you
Would you know when a song doesn't sing
Never really standing where you should've been
Holding on to rainbows, someone else's dreams
On and on and on
Is it love now?
Is it love now?
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
