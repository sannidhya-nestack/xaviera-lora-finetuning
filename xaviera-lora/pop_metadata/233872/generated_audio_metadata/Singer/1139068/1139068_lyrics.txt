Dismantled piece by piece
Falling apart
Back to where I began
Into the dark
Untethered and floating, I cannot see
Who am I becoming? What have I been?
In my cocoon
I hide
No fear, no fear inside
Will I awake
Or will I disappear
My thoughts like black water are creeping in
Grow heavy and sinking so it begins
(In my mind)
In my
Cuckoo, I hide
No fear, no fear inside
Will I awake?
Or will I disappear?
Dismantled piece by piece
Falling apart
Back to where I began into the dark
