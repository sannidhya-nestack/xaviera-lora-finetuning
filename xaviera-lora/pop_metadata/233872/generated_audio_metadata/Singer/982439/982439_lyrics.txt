Sitting on my back, packing my bags
Hoping that someone calls me back
Planning my next trip on a map alone
I'm traveling round the world
And I would wish that someone asked me to stay
Because I'm getting tired of walking away
My only destination is hope and I'm missing home
And I love the adventures that I have
I'd just like to have a place to come back
A warm house of friends to tell them my stories
Yes, I'd really like someone to call me back
Next time I pack my bags
Do you know how it feels to travel non-stop
To live in a train with nowhere to go
And everybody knows me around the globe
But when I'm down I've got nowhere to go
The sun and the moon are my only friends
Oh, I really need a home
A plane goes in an hour and I have to go
But I'll leave you this short letter just to let you know
That I would like you to be my home and take you everywhere I go
So if you come with me, I'll never leave you alone
And if we find a place or build our home
And tell our friends the stories of our journey
Please come with me
And now
I love the adventures that I have
Love the adventures that I have
Just like to have a place to
I just like to have a place to
Come back, a warm house of friends
So tell them
Let me tell them
Now
I'd really like someone to call me back now
Yes, I'd really like someone to call me back (call me back now)
Next time I pack my bags (cause I'm packing my bags)
And I love the adventures that I have
I'd just like someone to hold my hand
Next time I pat my back
