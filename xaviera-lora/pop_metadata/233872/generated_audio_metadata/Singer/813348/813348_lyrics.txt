There's a run in your nylon
Where you wear your rosary
I can't rid you of your demon
How'bout your hosiery?
Well, my virtue ain't your business
And this bustle ain't for rent
But I could use a tempered spirit, though
To wash down life's lament
High heels and high balls
Making my knees a week
How'd you get so salty? (How'd you get so sweet?)
Well now you don't even know me
Or how I take my ice
And stop looking where you want
My legs are no man's vice
This high priest of tall dreams
Confesses to the crime I'm gonna be
Baptized by sundown
Born again by closing time
High heels and high balls
Will nail me to the cross
I much prefer Chianti
In vino veritas
Sing till Monday pray for us
High heels and high balls
Making my knees a week
How'd you get so salty? (How'd you get so sweet?)
