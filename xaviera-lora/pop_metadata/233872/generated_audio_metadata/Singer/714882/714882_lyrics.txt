Lost inside this dream I'm with you
Hold your breath as we dive into water
Within the fountain of my own
Vanilla skies and eyes wide open
Winds that stir the heart's emotion
Wake, wake, wake
Intoxicate me with your love
Hold tight my hand'cause about to fly
I hope you're not afraid of heights
where we'll go, we'll go so high
Where we'll go, we'll touch the sky and
It's getting a little late to call
Think you better stay when in Rome
We who dance in the rain
Living to love out our days
We who dance in the rain
So write the story how you imagined
Make a classic and old fashioned lover
Pen every cliche on the page
This flame will burn in endless motion
To journey over many oceans
Wake, wake, wake into the dream we're living in
Hold tight my hand'cause about to fly
I hope you're not afraid of heights
where we'll go, we'll go so high
But where we'll go, we'll touch the sky and
It's getting a little late to call home
Think you better say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a good time to say it's a great
And in Rome we who dance in the rain
Living to love at our days
We who dance in the rain
'Cause it's getting a little late to call home
Think you better stay when in Rome
We who dance in the rain
Living to love at our days
We who dance in the rain
