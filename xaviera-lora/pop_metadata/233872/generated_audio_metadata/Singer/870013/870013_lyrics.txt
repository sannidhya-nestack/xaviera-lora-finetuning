Yellow curtains shining down on me
Do you see what I see?
Why am I not happy?
All I see is just this raging blue
It's like my heart's in two
You've got some blood on you
Socks are getting in my shoes and laces alone can't take away my blues
Are you only passing through or are you gonna love me?

Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Drops are getting in my shoes and laces alone can't take away my blues
Are you only passing through or are you gonna love me?
