In your eyes I see the universe reflected and it scares me
And I'm feeling very small against a rising tide
Of ideology and images and daydreams and of course
I want to see and feel and breathe and live to know the truth
In your eyes is another world and I wonder if I see you
Or a shadow cast by everything you try to hide away
And I understand what you're saying sometimes
And I understand honesty is pain
Seeing is believing
Knowing is receiving
What I want to know
Is where does all the heartache go?
In your eyes I see only what I want to see
But sometimes in your eyes I begin to see the truth
And although I know what's about to happen
I will wait to see the proof
Seeing is believing
Knowing is receiving
What I want to know
Is where does all the heartache go?
