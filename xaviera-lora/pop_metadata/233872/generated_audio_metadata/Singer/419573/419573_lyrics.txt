Keep it simple's what they say
But I cannot seem to escape my over complicated ways
And you are not that far behind
As we sit right here and laugh with all this crazy world to spin
I wonder where do we go
You know how I hate to think so much about how we are going to win
But that's okay, we have to dare, even though it's the case
Most dares we have to take one on the chin
And I like the way you talk to me with your mind
Talk about the moon, the stars, whatever, it's just fine
Winter, spring, summer, fall, rain or sunshine
I just like the way you talk to me with your mind
All across the universe
They're laughing real hard at us
As we've fumbled our way through all this stuff
They give you this, you give them that
It's quid pro quo, it's tit for tat
And then they always want more to blow
Of all the things that I don't know
I do know that someday
We all will be here standing
Without our clothes
So hold on tight it goes quite fast
And if we're lucky
We might last and grab a memory
For the road
And I like the way you talk to me with your mind
Tell me about the universe, tell me what is a sublime
Today, tomorrow, once again, whenever you like
I just like the way you talk to me with your mind
We're tasting light
We're touching time
Spinning around and round we go back to back for a while
We're breaking rules and we're doing fine
You dream with my eyes and I'll dream with your smile
We start today and from here we'll ride
I think of you and you think of me from time to time
So off we go
And don't be shy
There's a million places where
You can find me tonight
And I'll
Like the way you talk to me
With your mind
Show me a song or a rhyme
Or show me a sign
Now in a year or a hundred it's still alright
I just like the way you talk to me with your mind
I just like the way you talk to me with your mind
I just like the way you talk to me with your mind
