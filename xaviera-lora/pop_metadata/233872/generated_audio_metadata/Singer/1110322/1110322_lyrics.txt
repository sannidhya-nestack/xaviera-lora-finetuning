I showed a cool front to the world
Tried to keep out of the spotlight
Like a tough shell before a hurricane
That was vaguely seen in the twilight
But you've broken down my facade
You've rescued me from the dark
Now the light shines bright in my life
And you make me feel so alive, alive
Built my wall so high no stairs could reach
In a fortress around my heart
I'd been hurt many times before
But with you it was different from the start
You've broken down my facade
You've rescued me from the dark
Now the light shines bright in my life
And you make me feel so alive, alive
Our love has made everything new
And I'm ready to face the future with you
You've broken down my facade
Rescued me from the dark
Now the light shines bright in my life
And you make me feel so alive, alive
