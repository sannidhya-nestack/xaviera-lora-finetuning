So much is unfair
So much left to say
With no remedy
Anyway
Can you hear me now?
I'm singing loud and clear
With all that's left of me
And I thought we'd live forever
And I thought we were invincible
And I thought that we'd have longer
And I thought that I was stronger
How was I to know?
Fly away fast angel
Far from this world of grief
Far from the tears you see
Fly away now angel
You know that I love you
Go and find your peace
Born Independence Day
Your spirit was so free
Too perfect for this place
Anyway, can still remember clear
Last time I saw your face
You know I should have made you stay
But I thought we'd live forever
And I thought you were invincible
I should've saved moments longer
You know I would've held on stronger
But only God could know
Fly away fast angel
Far from this world of grief
Far from the tears you see
Fly away now angel
You know that I love you
Go and find your peace
Fly away fast angel
Far from this world of grief
Far from the tears you see, yeah
Fly away now angel
You know that I love you
Go and find your peace
Go and find your peace
Peace
