I went abroad at early age but seventeen or so
I'd wearied of the clouds, the waves, the ever cold, eternal shore
But for the things I treasured most I've been surprised to find
I close my eyes where'er I am
And then I visit Sky and Mind
Scotland was not far away
But Spain and China were
I aimed to see for myself how men were wiser there
It seemed quite the plain truth of things might clearer be to me
If I could only traverse o'er that barricade of sea
My mother begged me not to go, my father said but not
Our house was quiet like a tomb, save when we frankly fought
It saddened me to cause such pain but facts were clear to see
That island was too small a place for someone great as me
So I went abroad at early age, about seventeen or so
I'd wearied of the clouds, the waves, the ever cold, eternal shore
But for the things I treasure most, I've been surprised to find
I close my eyes where I am and then I visit sky and mind
And so I followed sail for years from London to Peru
And in each port I cast aside a boyish dream or two
I married in New Zealand where I closed my travel book
And settled on her people's farm
Not far from Mountain Cook
But now my son he comes to me a strapping boy in truth
And bothers me with queries'bout that island of my youth
His mother begs him not to go like mine did once so plea
Her words will bend him just as much as mother's own did me
Yeah, I went abroad at early age, but seventeen or so
I'd wearied of the clouds, the waves, the ever cold, eternal shore
But for the things I treasured most, I've been surprised to find
I close my eyes where'er I am
And then I visit sky and mind
But for the things I treasured most
I've been surprised to find
I close my eyes where'er I am
And then I visit sky and mind
But for the things that I treasure most
I'm still surprised to find
I close my eyes wherever I am
And then I visit sky and mind
