Every night at five, walk to the parking lot
Wondering if you're home, but hoping you're not
It's easier to be alone with one than two
Try to keep my thoughts under lock and key
But when the wheels start turning
They break free and bounce against the windshield
Come straight back at me
Been searching the right, looking for a sign
Should I keep driving, past exit 59
I've driven this road maybe a million times
Lifted the turn signal up, made the long slow climb
To the house that has never felt much like home
How can two people live together so long?
Night after night pretend nothing's wrong
With the silence so loud it echoes through every room
Been searching my horizon looking for a sign
Should I keep driving past exit 59?
Been living a life of quiet despair
Knowing there's nothing that can repair the damage
That's already been done
Maybe we'd both be better off
If I moved on
I could try to explain
Would it do any good
If you started listening
But you never could
Or should I spare you the effort
Or saying goodbye
Guess there's got to be someone to take the blame
I'll be the guilty one
You take the shame somehow I think you'll understand
A deal's been made
Been searching the horizon
Looking for a sign
The setting sun is telling me
It's about time
That I keep driving
Fast exit 59
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Fast exit 59
Gotta keep driving
