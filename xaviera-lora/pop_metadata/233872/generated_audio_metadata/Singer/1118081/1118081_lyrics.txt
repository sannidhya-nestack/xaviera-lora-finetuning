It's plain to see you're short on time
Those batteries are running dry
Now changes come as they must do
And I know I'm losing you
So close your eyes and go to sleep
If there's a place we can meet
And all over once again
These happy days
We've lived and loved
Those memories
Can't be touched
You took me to heaven
Many years ago
And that is why now
I want you to know
I'll never miss you
You'll always be here
My head and heart
Won't shed no tears
we can do it all
And
So close your eyes and go to sleep
If there's a place we can meet
Those battles won and those we lost
We can do it all over once again
We can do it all over once again
I won't say goodbye
That'd be just a lie
we can do it all over
Can't do it all over
Once again, again, again, again, again, again, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh _eyeh _ey _ey _ey _ey _ey _ey _ey _ey _ey _ey _ey _ey _ey _ey _ey _ey _ey _ey _
