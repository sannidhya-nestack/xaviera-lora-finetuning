I'm not afraid to let go
But I just can't turn around, oh
I'll see you there with your head down
And chicken tears falling down to the ground
And I'll et all I know, oh
If you love me
You let me go
But baby you know, oh, oh
Baby you know, oh, oh
Baby you know, you know, oh
I gave you all that I can
Why can't you understand
You're just not ready to be my man
I gave you all that I can
Why won't you understand
You're just not ready to be my man
So I'm gone, yeah I'm gone
I'm standing at the open door
And I'm ready to step out, out
But you're there blue eyes and you don't care
Looking at me with tears like I don't care
And I feel all marked down, oh
This isn't love
And that's not enough
This isn't love
And that's not enough
If you love me
You let me go
