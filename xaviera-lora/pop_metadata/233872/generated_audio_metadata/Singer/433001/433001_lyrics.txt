It's coming down to throwing blows
And throwing lives away
You're changing everything I know
I find it all absurd somehow
Stupid ways you work your mouth
Can anyone explain to me?
Wheels keep turning, wheels keep turning
Round and round, round and round
Wheels keep turning, wheels keep turning round, oh yeah
It's getting old, it's getting late
I'm thinking it's time to go
I think you're always on my mind
I can't concern myself today
And all those things you do
I think you're always on my mind, no
I find it all absurd somehow
Stupid ways you work your mouth
And anyone explain to me, yeah, yeah
Wheels keep turning, wheels keep turning
Round and round and round and round
Wheels keep turning, wheels keep turning
Find it all absurd somehow
Stupid ways you work'em out
And it ain't worth explainin' to mankind
Wheels keep turnin', wheels keep turnin'
Round and round, round and round
Wheels keep turnin', wheels keep turnin' around
Not giving, wheels keep turning, wheels keep turning round and round, round and round
Wheels keep turning, wheels keep turning round
Not giving, wheels keep turning, wheels keep turning round and round, round and round
Wheels keep turning, wheels keep turning round
