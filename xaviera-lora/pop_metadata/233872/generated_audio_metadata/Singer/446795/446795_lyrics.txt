With a bow so purposeful
The arrow took its aim
Helping on love and fear
Straight through my heart it came
Though frozen many years
The tip so fine with lead
The target it did pierce
Crimson in the blood
Unzip my heart with your grace
Give it the light of your full embrace
I beg you please, your shot's hit its mark
I'm down on my hands and knees
I beg you please, unzip my heart
I see you now so clear
Both winged and full of flight
Unstartled as you near
My aim still in your sight
Is one not yet enough
How many can I stand?
You had me at hello
Just take me by the hand
Unzip my heart with your grace
Give us the light of your full embrace
I beg you please, your shot hit its mark
I'm down on my hands and knees
I beg you please
Unzip my heart
Dethrone me from this pain
Expose the light of day
The center of my love
Unhidden now always
Unzip my heart with your grace
Give us the light of your full embrace
I beg you please, your shot's hit its mark
I'm down on my hands and knees
Beg you please
Unzip my heart with your grace
Give us the light of your full embrace
I beg you please, your shot hit its mark
I'm down on my hands and knees
I beg you please, unzip my heart
