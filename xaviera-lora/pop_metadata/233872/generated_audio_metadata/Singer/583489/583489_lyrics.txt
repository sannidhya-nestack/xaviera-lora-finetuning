You whisper sweet nothings
Pleasures my ears
Promise you'll everything you say
Have no fear
I'll always be with you
I'll always be there
You won't have to worry
No you won't have a care
In the truth of the matter, yeah
In the things that you said
Is that action speak my loving words and
You said, "Sweetie Fae"
You whisper sweet nothings, it pleases my mind
You gave me your word, in my trust you would find
Belief in the future is all that matters now
Cause what came before us is in the past anyhow
And in the truth of the matter, yeah
And in the things that you say
Is that actions speak louder than words, yeah
You said, "Sweet F .A."
Doo-be-doo-be-doo-doo
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-doo
You whisper sweet nothings
But just one last time
In your attempt to convince me
Do you think I am blind?
One's bitten twice shy
Or so the saying goes
So don't ask me why
Just take your nothings and go
But in the truth of the matter, yeah
And in the things that you say
Is that actions speak louder than words, and
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh
But in the truth of the matter, yeah
And in the things that you say
Is that actions speak louder than words
And baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
You say
Sweet F .A.
