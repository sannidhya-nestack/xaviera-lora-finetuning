In all this crazy time I've been alive, I don't have that much to share
I've tried to give it everything I've got and lived without a care
Trying to sing a song someone connects to
Trying to make the best of what's out there
You're always shining with that smile on, looking so fine
You always bring me back again
And I just wanna say how much I love you
I just wanna tell how much I care
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Restoring every dance and every glance that you ever cast my way
I'm not leaving anything to chance I'm gonna tell you everyday
You're always shining with that smile on
Looking so good, you always bring me back again
I just wanna say how much I love you
I just wanna tell how much I care
Oh baby that I care
I just wanna say how much I love you
I just wanna tell how much I care
Oh, and you can drive me crazy, it's the good kind of crazy
It's why you're always on my mind
Nothing left to do but slide, and there's nothing left to hide
All we gotta do is glide, we're gone
I just wanna say how much I love you
I just wanna tell how much I care
Oh baby that I care
I just wanna say how much I love you
I just wanna tell how much I care
Say how much I care, baby that I care
Say how much I care
Say how much I care, baby that I care
Say how much I care
