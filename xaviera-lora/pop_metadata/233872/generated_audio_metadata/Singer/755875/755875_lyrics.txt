Maybe it's the way that you really really get me
Maybe it's the way you make time stand still
All I really know is that you are coming with me
Now that I have found you I know you will
And I'm so glad you exist
And I'm so glad you're alive in my lifetime
To think of all I'd have missed
Yeah, I'm so glad you exist
I always knew inside me that you were out there somewhere
And hoped that in that somewhere you'd wait for me
You know it all makes sense now
Without you is past tense now
Everything that happened was meant to be
And I'm so glad you exist
And I'm so glad you're alive in my lifetime
To think of all I'd have missed
Yeah, I'm so glad you exist
There's nothing I love more than when we're dancing in the morning
I wanna spend my whole life waking with you
I've never felt so healthy, I've never been so happy
I've never loved another so good and true
You make it all okay
Ohio was just a four letter word'til I met you
There's nothing better than this
Yeah, I'm so glad you exist
And I'm so proud you're my man
And I'm so glad you weren't born in Greenland
To think of all I'd have missed
Yeah, I'm so glad you exist
