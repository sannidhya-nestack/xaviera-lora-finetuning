The bright lights speckin' with their shows and delights
They take me to the center stage where I prepare for the fight
And now I know who you are and I know how you lie
I lost my luck with the roll of a dice
The shark it swallowed me whole as I attempted to dive
Now I sink alone in my shame but I drown to survive
Though now I know who I am, this Joker inside
The house is letting me go
Her diamonds laughing me so
The clubs that never could know
Just how many hearts they've broken
Black and red seduced me as I stared at her head
Never knowing if she would fall or how she would land
Her promises they drew me in and they dragged me down
I gave my all for the king and his queen
With their spades they buried me deep
In a table of green
And I disappeared in their game
Never again to be seen
But now I see what I was
And what I could have been
The house is making me show
In suits they force me to go
And Jack he never will know
Just how many times he broke me
And Jack he never will know
Just how many times he broke me
Just how many times he broke me
