Mama said the jealousy's the purest form of flattery
So go ahead, keep making fun of me, yeah
Talk me down, it builds you up in case you haven't had enough
Don't et to laugh at all my dreams
You didn't have to be so mean
But I don't expect an apology
Say what you want
Say I'll pretend that it's all okay
Sticks and stones are all you got anyway
And do what you wanna do
Guess that doesn't change the truth
I've never been better since the day I left you
Why'd I hang on every word? I thought that you'd defy my worth
I could've saved myself a lot of hurt, oh
I used to care, I used to cry, but ever since I said goodbye
I found the strength in me I couldn't find
Try and try to knock me down
I'm too far away for you to hit me now
Say what you wanna say, I'll pretend that it's all right
Okay, sticks and stones are all you got anyway
And do what you want
'Cause that doesn't change the truth
I've never been better since the day I left you
What you meant to me is just a memory
I moved on to something new
But I want you to know
Even though you don't I still wish the best for you
Say what you wanna say, I'll pretend that it's all okay
Sticks and stones are all you got anyway, yeah
Do what you want
'Cause that doesn't change the truth
I've never been better since the day I left
I've never been better since the day I left
I've never been better since the day I left you
