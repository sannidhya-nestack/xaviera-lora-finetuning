Back when I had a life didn't care if the world was round
Busy chasing rainbows'til I ran'em down
Yeah, maybe a dreamer and that might be my fault
But back when I had a life I sure didn't have it all
I had freedom, nothing to hold me down
Give me freedom
To turn this life I'm living around
There's also plenty and it's easy to survive
Me, I'm working two jobs just to stay alive
Still I'm proud to be living in the land of the free
And that's the one thing you can't take from me
I have freedom
Nothing to hold me down
Give me freedom
To turn this life I'm living around
So when I'm caught up in this daily grind
Of pain or gain
I know it's only just a matter of time
Till I break loose from this ball and chain
I need freedom, I want freedom
I need freedom, give me freedom
Oh, give me freedom (Oh, give me freedom)
