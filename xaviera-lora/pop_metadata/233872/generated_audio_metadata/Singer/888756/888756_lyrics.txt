It's my favorite kind of date, the type to celebrate
everything is coming together
Knew exactly what I wanted, went out and jumped right on it
Now I'm happy to say
Ay, ay, ay
This is the best that could happen
It's just the best day I'm having
This is the best thing to happen for me
Now smiling's my new thing and life feels more in sync
The road rolls right up to meet me
I couldn't ask for better, it's perfect to the letter
And I'm so happy to say, ay ay ay
This is the best that could happen (everything's right)
It's just the best day I'm having (just the best)
This is the best thing to happen for me (best things for me)
This is the best thing to happen for me
