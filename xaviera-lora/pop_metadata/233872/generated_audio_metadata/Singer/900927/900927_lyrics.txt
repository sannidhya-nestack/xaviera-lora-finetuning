When darkness enters in
You feel you've reached your limit
And winter's silent depths come to visit
The branches of the trees are bony fingers pointing
At every last beauty leaving history
If you can't find your footing
Some solid ground to stand on
Call on your angels waiting with your wings
And fly baby just try
The sky is waiting tonight
A thousand tries is all it takes to fly
The light will lead the way
As all illusions fade
You hear them call your name
The one that heaven gave
They gather'round you now
And welcome you about
And all your fears fall down
As love surrounds
They help you find your footing
Some solid ground to stand on
They are your angels waiting with your wings
So fly baby just try
The sky is waiting tonight
A thousand tries is all it takes to fly
Just fly, baby, just try
The sky is waiting tonight
A thousand tries is all it takes to fly
If you can't find your footing
Some solid ground to stand on
Call on your angels waiting with your words
Fly baby just try
The sky is waiting tonight
A thousand tries is all it takes to fly
Let's fly, baby, just try
The sky is waiting tonight
A thousand tries is all it takes to the light
