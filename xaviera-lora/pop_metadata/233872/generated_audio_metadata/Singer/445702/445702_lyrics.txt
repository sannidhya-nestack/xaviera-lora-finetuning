This morning I woke up to find
Oh you're not here anymore
And I'm crying
And I think that I would do anything
Oh, to take back all the bad things between you and me
Oh, where'd you go?
All your pictures gone, gone, gone
I thought I was your superhero
Oh, where'd you go
Today things won't be the same
No without you to talk to
To be with or to sing to
And I think that tomorrow's gonna be the same
And I wish all that we were
The same as we used to be
Oh, where'd you go?
All your pictures gone, gone, gone
I thought I was your superhero
Oh, where'd you go?
Oh, where'd you go?
All your pictures are gone, gone, gone
I thought I was your superhero
Oh, where'd you go?
Oh, where'd you go?
All your pictures gone, gone, gone
I thought I was your superhero
Where'd you go?
