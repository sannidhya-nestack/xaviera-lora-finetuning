Or before you accuse me will you best better know the truth
Yeah before you accuse me hey
Well you best better know the truth
I said hey what you gonna do
When the karma comes back to you
Or you could jump to conclusions
Shouting out kinds of crazy things
You could jump to conclusions
Shouting all kinds of crazy things
But words they are deceiving
And you know your lies they ain't the truth
Life's about freeing your soul, not this deceptive mind control
Life's about freeing your soul, not this deceptive mind control
I said hey what you gonna do when the karma comes back to you
Oh before you accuse me will you best better know the truth
Oh before you accuse me hey
Will you best better know the truth
I said hey what you gonna do
When the karma comes back to you
