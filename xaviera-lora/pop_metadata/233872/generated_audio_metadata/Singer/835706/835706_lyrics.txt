Over the clouds this life belongs to me
Soaking in warmth down to my dangling feet
Fairy dust in hand, love's in high demand
I got some, there's plenty here to share
'Cause I am flying, alive and free
I'm living in the moment every breath I breathe
I'm gliding higher, alive and free
I let the good things all just roll right into me
I turn the sun on with a wave of hand
Imagine life is under my command
Floating round the love, feeling such a buzz
You want some, I'll sprinkle light your way
'Cause I am flying, alive and free
I'm living in the moment every breath I breathe
I'm gliding higher, alive and free
I let the good things all just roll right into me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause I am flying, alive and free
I'm living in the moment every breath I breathe
I'm gliding higher, alive and free
I let the good things all just roll right into me
Over the clouds this life belongs to me
