When I'm lost you help me find my way
You never judge me when I make mistakes
I'll always trust you more than anyone
You're as constant as the morning sun
That's what you are
Wherever I go, you're my guiding star
You add color to my life, you've opened up my eyes
I see things more clearly now with you by my side
Illumination
Being home with you is my safe place
We just sit and talk about our days
A million candles wouldn't be enough
there's nothing warmer than your love
Illumination, that's what you are
Wherever I go, you're my guiding star
You add color to my life
You've opened up my eyes
I see things more clearly now
With you by my side
Illumination
Even on my blackest night
Your love is an endless ray of light
Illumination, that's what you are
Wherever I go, you're my guiding star
You add color to my life
You've opened up my eyes
I see things more clearly now
With you by my side
Illumination
Illumination
