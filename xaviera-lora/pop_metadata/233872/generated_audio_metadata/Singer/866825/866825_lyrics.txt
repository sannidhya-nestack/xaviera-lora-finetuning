Every now and then I get the feeling I've been here before
I remember when you used to close me out your door
And I'd go home a sorry lad
And think of nasty things of you make me so mad
Why do you insist on calling me when I'm half asleep
And slamming the phone down after you call me such a creep
I'd have to sit up and wonder what you were on about
Sit in total darkness, sober in my doubts
One day I'll find a girl who's right for me
And I pray she will not be the death of me
Oh, yeah
I will never know why I don't say goodbye to you
we don't seem to have much in common, if that's the truth
Always fight like cats and dogs
The tide may be thrashing but we're always on the run
