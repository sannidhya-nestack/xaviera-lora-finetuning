Her life's been a mystery since the day she was born
Born into a family who was too world weary and worn
To see the light in her burning
Only saw what they needed to see
So she'd glow, no one would know
That's why she called for me
I'm her imaginary companion
From a star that once fell, all she wants is someone to know her well
So she learned to keep quiet
Learned to live where the edges can blur
Trees could sing, the earth whispered things
That only she heard
I was always beside her
The child of the shadows and me
Where we'd shine, her brilliance and mine
Cloaked in invisibility
I'm her imaginary companion
She swore that she'd never tell
All she wants is someone to know her well
Though she tried to fit in
She felt so alien
Walk between worlds, solitary girl
Lit up from within, tending the flame
Blowing the cold, I came as a guardian soul
Warming her deep enough to keep that innocence whole
In a world full of strangers
Too much to buy and sell
All she wants is someone to know her well
In a world full of strangers
Too much to buy and sell
All she wants is someone to know her well
All she wants is someone
All she wants is someone
All she wants is someone to know her well
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
