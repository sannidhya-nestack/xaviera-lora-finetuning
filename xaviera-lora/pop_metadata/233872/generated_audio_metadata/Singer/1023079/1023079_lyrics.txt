It's harder to say goodbye when you're holding on this tight
You really gotta let it go
It's easy to fear being on your own when you've always had someone there
And I know that you don't see it
But baby you've gotta believe it
This is just what we need to grow
One day you're gonna find
The one you wanted me to be
You gotta leave the past behind
You gotta let go of me
You gotta let go of me
You've told me a thousand times
We can make it if we give it one more try
But I can't keep playing along
When I see what you need
And I know that I'm not the one
And I know it's hard to believe it
But eventually you will see it
This is exactly what you need
Oh, one day you're gonna find
The one you wanted me to be
You've gotta leave the past behind
You gotta let go of me
You gotta let go of me
And if you're ever gonna find
The one who's meant to be
You gotta leave the past behind
You gotta let go of me
One day you're gonna find
The one you want me to be
You gotta leave the past behind
You gotta let go of me
You gotta let go of me
You gotta let go of me
You gotta let go of me
