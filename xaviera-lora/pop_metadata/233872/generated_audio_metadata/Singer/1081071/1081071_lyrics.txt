Fragile in the wind
A tender place within the soul
It hurts to let go
Heavy are the thoughts
But all that has been taught
Will lighten the load
Just carry on down this road
Let the light in now
It is time to allow
The water to clear
And wash away the fear
I see in a new world
A forest full of bluebirds
Can you see through the door?
Serve the healer
The warm light of love
The calming ocean of waves
To carry you and I so gently
The warm light of love
The calming ocean of waves
To carry you and I so gently
Rebuilding this house, this home
Painting the colors of the flowers we've grown
There's so much room for you here, my dear
Will you come with me?
Let me show you all I know
The fire, the earth, the world how it turns
So slowly I'll treasure the memories
The water, the air, time yet to be shared
Let's watch as our world rolls steady ahead
A promise, a life, your hand held in mine
Here in these moments, my heart is full for you
This season is ours, summer made of stars
And we will be falling forward forever
The warm light of love
The calming ocean of waves that carry you and I so gently
The warm light of love
The calming ocean of waves that carry you and I so gently
Let's walk, let's dance
Through the meadows of chance
Through summers and falls
We have all we need
Let's run, let's swim
The flow of the rivers are in our hearts, my dear
