I wear the scarletest tattooed on my head
Beneath my crown of shame, dripping crimson red
My battered inner child
A festival of sin
Screaming abuse claims
My day of reckoning
What's this I've become?
The devil's protégé
Lost all I had gained
Somewhere along the way
No accuser do I fear
No witness do I dread
Nothing threatens me like the conscience in my head
I dragged this weighted ball down streets of no return
Knowing it contained
Sins for all to burn
Is no hope to be found
Does mercy not exist
iveness only from
This beast that I have kissed
What's this I've become
The devil's protege
Lost all I had gained
Somewhere along the way
No accuser do I fear
No witness do I dread
Nothing threatens me
Like the conscience in my head
Shipwrecked far from home
I thought that joy had come
A life from good to bad
A gain of zero sun
I thought my fellow man
Had Christian goals in mind
But what I found instead
Was nothing of the kind
