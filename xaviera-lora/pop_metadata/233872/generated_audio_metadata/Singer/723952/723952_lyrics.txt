Mmm, I'm happy
I got a story here to tell
Summer time, the weather's fine
Smile on my face, the girl is mine
I'm happy, so happy
The ring in my pocket, I'm set to go
Marry the girl'cause I love her so
Happy, I'm happy
Let's build a place called home
And never be alone again
Until the very end
So happy
Mm mm mm
I get to her door and I ring the bell
She won't believe what I had to tell her
I'm happy
So happy
I take a deep breath, I'm doing all I can
When I get on my knee, asking for her hand
Make me happy
Oh so happy
Let's build a place called home
And never be alone, you see
And now it's you and me
Maybe we'll end up getting grey and old
But we will never ever be alone
And maybe we could buy a great big house
Where all our kids could play and roll
So let's build that place called home
And never be alone again
Until the very end
I'm happy, so happy
Oh and by the way before I et it
I can tell you how the story went
Happily she was in love with me until the very end
We built that place called home
And never were alone, you see
Still it's her and me
I'm happy, mmm-mmm-mmm
So happy, do-do-do-do-do-do
I'm happy, do-do-do-do
