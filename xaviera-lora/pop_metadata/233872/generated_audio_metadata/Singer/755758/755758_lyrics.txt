I'm a little disquieted
I'm a little bit scared
I've been all tore up
So sorry you get what's left
Can you give me some shelter
Can you lend me some peace
Then can you tell me answers
To questions that bleed
You're a little bit older, doesn't make you more wise
The last bull made me so sick from swallowing my pride
he woke up by love and never came back
He tied my heartbeat down to railroad tracks
Like you claim your pretty eyes could always be true
And I say yeah,'cause I don't believe you
I say yeah,'cause I don't believe you
I just got a phone call, guess what, it was him
He wished me love in my future, but late words are a sin
You'd have to be lonely to know how it feels
To fall asleep next to memories and wake with no one here
I am a soldier, I am so strong
I am the one thing that keeps me moving on
he woke up by love and never came back
He tied my heartbeat down to railroad tracks
Like you claim your pretty eyes could always be true
And I say yeah
I don't believe you
I say yeah
I don't believe you
But let me be honest
I'm broken inside
You've seen me naked
But there is so much I hide
The touch of you moves me
Your breath on my skin
The more I resist you
The deeper I'm in
Yes, you with the kind eyes, I think you understand
You love a broke woman, are you a strong enough man?
'Cause he woke up by love and never came back
He tied my heartbeat down to railroad tracks
Now you clear your pretty eyes could always be true
And I say yeah
'Cause I don't believe you, I say yeah,'cause I don't believe
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
