I often wonder what it is that I need
I want to find out why it's all a mystery
Looking for miracles to fill the empty spaces in my life
And I'm trying to understand
Clear the haze
So I can finally see who I am
All eyes open wide
Waking up from their slumber
Looking at the world in wonder
All eyes (all eyes)
See the signs (see the signs)
Breaking the spell they're under
Looking at the world in wonder
All eyes
Ooh, all eyes
They often tell me
I should just let it go
But something inside me makes me just wanna know
Is there an antidote to help me see the magic in my life?
But I'm doing all I can
Find a way
So I can finally see who I am
All eyes open wide
Waking up from their slumber
Looking at the world in wonder
All eyes (all eyes)
See the signs (see the signs)
Breaking the spell they're under
Looking at the world in wonder
All eyes (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Ah (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Ah (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Ah (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
But I'm doing all I can
Find a way
So I can finally see who I am
All eyes open wide
Waking up from their slumber
Looking at the world in wonder, baby
All eyes see the signs
Breaking the spell they're under
Looking at the world in wonder, all eyes, all eyes
