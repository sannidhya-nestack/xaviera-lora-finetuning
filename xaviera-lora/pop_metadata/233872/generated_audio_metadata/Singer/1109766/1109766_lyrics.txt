I wake up after dreaming of us
The real life is better when you're in love
And I can feel you right next to me
Serenity
I love every moment with you
Anytime with you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's a better day with you
Walking the street, breathing the air
Feeling the breezes run through our hair
Taking it easy, we don't have a plan
Holding hands, I love every moment with you
Anytime with you (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's a better day with you
Hearing you sing the song in my head
You know what I'll say before it's said
You, anytime with you
It's a better day with you
It's a bad day with you
