Deep within those shadows I hide
Lost in the darkness
Can't find no light
Under your veil of heartache and pain
Under your spell
Here once again
But I can see a distant light
Step outside and feel the warmth of summer sun
Upon my face
And taste the air so fresh and clear
Fading drums within my ears
Open my eyes
It's here at last
Take it all in now
I can't
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
You kept me down when I was high
And you made me wall
When I really wanted to fly
Depressed within your heart's control
You held my hand
But you crushed my soul
But I can see a distant light
Step outside and feel the warmth of summer sun
Upon my face
And taste the air so fresh and clear
Fading drums within my ears
Open my eyes
It's here at last
Take it all in now
I can
I can breathe
I can breathe
Never again will I be
So into you and out of me
Never again where I was once
So pale in my significance
Never again will I be
So into you and out of me
Never again
I can breathe
I can breathe
Let me breathe
Let me breathe
Let me breathe
Let me breathe
I can breathe
