You, you came into my life
You suddenly were there
As if within a dream, dream
You, your wings are flying high
You're soaring through the sky
You're so beautiful, you
And you show me how to fly
Fly up in the sky
See your gossamer wings
Makes me start to sing
Makes me start to cry
That's when I'm alive, live, you
You're all that I can see
I'm left here in the dust
You're all that you can be, be
You, you bring a special warmth
You make the sun rise
You make me feel whole
And, you show me how to fly
Fly up in the sky
See your gossamer wings
Makes me start to sing
Makes me start to cry
That's when I'm alive, alive, you
You jet stream to my soul
With a sacred heart
I see your halo, halo
You, you're warm within my soul
You're all I care to know
You breathe life into me, me
And you show me how to fly
Fly up in the sky
See your gossamer wings
Makes me start to sing
Makes me start to cry
That's when I'm alive
Life
