Never thought I'd feel this way
Days go by, you're still the same
They say these things just take time
It's a slow and steady climb
You kept me wondering, questioning things about myself
Second guessing, obsessing, my heart upon a shelf
I was fading, ooh, fading away, fading away, fading away
Ooh, fading away
Such a dangerous place to be
It's like a crime to some degree
When one questions their own worth
Rise from those ashes, a second birth
Don't keep on wondering, questioning
Things about yourself, second guessing
Obsessing, your heart upon the shelf
I was fading
Fading away, fading away, fade down the way
Fading away
Fading away
Don't keep on wondering
Questioning things about yourself
Second guessing
Obsessing your heart upon myself
Fading away
