When I look back to all the trouble and difficulties
I was going through
I feel the ache and once again I'm shivering
I don't know what to do
Was I wrong to go on this way? Should I turn back?
Or tell my mom to blame for all the confusions around me?
If I got the choice, I would've done the same
Wherever you're gonna go tomorrow
Whatever you're gonna do
Wherever you're gonna be
You gotta take her with you
And you better keep the fire still burning in your soul
I'll take her with you
Well, I can still see all the faces staring at me
Like a greedy beast
While the crowd was talking about me
The high society, I gather for the feast
Oh, oh, a nice fancy dress ball
All the same make-ups, all the same costumes
Well, I can still hear all the laughter
See the paved faces and smell the sweet perfume
Whatever you're gonna say tomorrow
Whatever you're gonna feel
Whatever you're gonna make
You gotta take it with you
And you better keep your fever hot as long as you can
Take it with you
I'm going off with all the memories
I know that I will remember everything
My mind is filled up like a bottle
Up to the rim, I'll weave my favorite dream
Yes, one day I'll taste it, some precious drops
And I will have my fun
It will remind me of the past
Not the trail that I've been on
Wherever you're gonna stay tomorrow
Whoever will take care
Wherever you gonna live
You gotta take her with you
And you better keep the treasure kept for you and your soul
Take her with you
Well, I don't say that I'm angry
I was feeling lonesome, but now I understand
And realized that it was right to carry on that way
Without a helping hand
Yes, you look evil someone who cares for you
When you're feeling down
But even if there is nobody
You can do everything on your own
Whatever you're gonna start tomorrow
Whomever you're gonna leave
Whatever you're gonna plan
You gotta take her with you
And you're never alone when the fire's still in your soul
Take her with you
