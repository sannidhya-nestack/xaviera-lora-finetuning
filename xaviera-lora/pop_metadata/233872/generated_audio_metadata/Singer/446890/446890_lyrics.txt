While he pays the cost
I'm drowning in tears
Through all of my fears
His life soon cut short
Unless that he's got
The help that he needs
I'm begging you please
Reach down, reach deep
And yes, you should weep
His sister is five, though barely alive
We've got to accept, we must intercept
Let's get this thing done, we can help someone
I've looked and I've seen, we share the same dream
I'm drowning in tears through all of my fears
His life's soon cut short unless that he's got
The help that he needs
I'm begging you please reach down
Reach deep
And yes, you should weep
He is our son, she's our daughter
We're one in this world
All sisters and brothers
If they lived next door
You'd understand
Don't wait'til they're gone
To offer your hand
I'm drowning in tears
Through all of my fears
Their lives soon cut short
Unless they've both got
The help that they need
I'm begging you please
Reach down
Reach deep
And yes you should weep
Ooh ooh ooh
Yes you should weep
