What I miss, what I miss most
Is the devil in your eyes and the angel in your soul
And I want just to know your will
That the angel hasn't left
That the devil's raising hell
Five years is a long time
Someone becomes your lifeline
They pick you up and make you shine
Save you when you're sinking
Oh, this is what we do
You save me and I save you
We lose ourselves and need to be rescued
No matter how hard it gets
Or even if it leaves us fighting for breath
Love is strong enough to pull us from the darkness
When all my drifting ends, maybe I'll find love again
But it will never be the same, even if I could pretend
Cause your voice still echoes in my head
And I know I need the silence
But I wish that it would stay
Five years is a long time
Someone becomes your lifeline
You find you in the nick of time
Just as you stop believing
Now everything's a shade of grey
And all my strength has drained away
I'm just the manners of the board
And no one's there to hear me calling
Oh, this is what we do
You save me and I save you
Lose ourselves and need to be rescued
No matter how hard it gets
Even if it leaves us fighting for breath
Love is strong enough to pull us from the darkness
And I need your life by now
And I need your life by now
And I need your life by now
