All this love (all this love)
All this love (all this love)
All the places we will go
So opulent and gold
Oh, unravel in the glow
Can you hear the river flow?
Oh, sumptuous and slow
Come with me and say hello
It's gonna be alright, okay
It's gonna be alright, okay
It's gonna be alright, okay
It's gonna be alright, okay
The sun shines bright, bright through the clouds
The sun shines bright on everyone
When beautiful days turn into beautiful nights after the sun
It's been a long cold winter night
But I feel the warmth flowing into my life
This change is long overdue, oh what a sight
Come on and take a ride with me, the ride is free
I'll take you away from this place, we'll move on and on and on
All that we really need is someone to make us smile
This is my gift to you, hold onto it for a while
These days you're all that's on my mind
To get away with you if you've got the time
We can go to a paradise, yeah, where we can unwind
We've got more of a choice than we think
Just give me the keys to your civic and we'll drive to the brink
These old ways of thinking leave me out of sync
Come on and take a ride with me, the ride is free
I'll take you away from this place, we'll move on and on and on
All that we really need is someone to make us smile
This is my gift to you
Hold on to it for a while, yeah
All that we really need is someone to make us smile
This is my gift to you
Hold on to it for a while
