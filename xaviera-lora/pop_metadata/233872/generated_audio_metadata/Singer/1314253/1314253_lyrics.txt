If Karel was right here today, you know he would be proud
His great grandson is walking tall, way above the clouds
From circus feats to mountain peaks, boy, it's steady as I go
And so I want this high wire
it's the only life I know
I'm a man on a wire
I'm living step by step
These dreams can't take me higher
Than any place I've been
There's a power in believing
And there's courage in my bones
There's a faith that holds me up here
And it's like nothing else I've known
So I'll never give up, never giving
Gonna make it to the other side
Yes, I'll never give up, never giving
Well, this is my time to shine
Yes, I'll never give up, never giving
I'm walking here for my life
And with the love of God to hold me up
I can walk here every time
You know I'm merely mortal
Lord Jesus, be my guide
With my family beside me
It makes everything alright
With all this love to hold me
I must be blessed by God above
Yeah, I can't walk this wire
I am walking in His love
And I'll never give up, never giving
Gonna make it to the other side
Yes, I'll never give up, never giving
Yeah, this is my time to shine
Yes, I'll never give up, never give in
I'm walking for my life
With the love of God to hold me up
I can walk here every time
If Karel was right here today
I know he would be proud
