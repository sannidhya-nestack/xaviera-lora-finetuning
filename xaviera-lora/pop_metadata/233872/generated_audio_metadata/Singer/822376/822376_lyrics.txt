Don't keep me waiting
Don't keep me waiting too long
My time's ticking
I can't keep hanging on
My heart is breaking baby
Why'd you keep me waiting so long?
I've been so patient but I'm, I'm tired of being alone
The stars are up, the moon is bright
I'm holding on in this candlelight
The tide is high, it's getting late
So why do you procrastinate
The seasons changing, my heart has fallen for you
Anticipating but I'm lonely I'm blue
You're so sweet talking but I don't need another best friend
Come be my lover baby all this will have to end
Another day has been and gone
Just blown away, I'm still alone
Our time is now, you'd better run
soon I'll be moving on
So don't keep me waiting
Too long
Don't keep me waiting
Don't keep me waiting
Too long
I can't keep hanging on
My time's ticking
Don't keep me waiting
Don't keep me waiting too long
Don't keep me waiting
Don't keep me waiting
Too long
Don't keep me waiting
Don't keep me waiting
Too long
So don't keep me waiting
Don't keep me waiting
Too long
My heart is breaking
Don't keep me waiting
Don't keep me waiting
Too long
