Abandoned on the doorstep of the 21st century
Carolina took her first step in Nashville, Tennessee
A child of too much love and the pain of a broken home
Caroline across the line and never drove back alone
Carolina's father was a teacher, taught himself to hide away
Her mother was a lover of another, couldn't wait another day
A brother and a sister running closer than blood was meant to be
Carolina finds out the hard way life ain't easy
No woman on earth should ever endure the curse and the shame
No one who lives, ets or ives God's second mistake
Arm in arm, hand in hand, the kiss she plants burns her friend
Down in no man's land
Gay ride nights, diesel dykes, rainbow lights
Shine paradise in Carolina's eyes
No husband and wife, domestic strife
No shaking mops, baking cookies
Making babies in her lady loving life
Two women in love
Two beautiful women in love
With each other
No woman on earth should ever endure the curse of my shame
No one who lives, ets or ives God's second mistake
Arm in arm, hand in hand
The kiss she plants burns her bread
Down in no man's land
Arm in arm, hand in hand
The kiss she plants burns her brand
Down in no man's land
Down in no man's land
Down in no man's land
