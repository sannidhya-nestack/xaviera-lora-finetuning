Fingertips almost touched
Watch your lips almost brush mine
How could I be so blind?
Cheek to cheek, arm in arm
Telling secrets in the dark
Thought that I, thought that I held your heart
I wanna go back to what we never had
We were so close, you were always almost mine
How did I know, you'd steal my heart and take your time?
And now you're with her, saying those words I should have said to you
It feels like I lost you, but you were never mine to lose
She's beautiful, I understand
But did you ever think you were meant for me?
But I'll hold back every tear
And watch you disappear
We were so close
You were always almost mine
How did I know
It's still my heart to take your time?
And now you're with her, saying those words I should've said to you
It feels like I lost you
But you were never mine to lose
But I'll smile like I mean it
I want the best for you, you see
I just wish the best for you was me
We were so close, you were always almost mine
How did I know, it'd steal my heart and take your time?
We were so close, you were always almost mine
How did I know, it'd steal my heart and take your time?
And now you're with her, saying those words I should've said to you
It feels like I lost you, but you were never mine to lose, never mine to lose
