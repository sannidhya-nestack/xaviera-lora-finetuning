What's life mean in a desperate night?
When possibilities seem out of sight?
What's it mean when it feels like sand?
I see it slipping through your veins
What the hell makes us real
With everything now known to consider
Does she know what's going on with you
Does she know that you're the reason why
Does she know that you've been trying to
Set the stage to a perfect crime
What's in me for the wounded heart
Tempered by the one who holds the cards
Communication in a sleeping mode
Shit gets old on the dusty road
What's the truth what's in your file?
It's not the same, no, no
Behind that smile, no
Does she know what's going on with you?
Does she know that you're the reason why?
Does she know that you've been trying too?
Set the stage to a perfect crime
Does she know what's going on with you?
Does she know that you're the reason why?
Does she know that you've been trying to
Set the stage to a perfect crime?
