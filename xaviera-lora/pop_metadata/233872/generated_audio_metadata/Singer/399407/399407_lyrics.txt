Born with a vision of a golden cherry bright to the sun
A quest consisting of gaining power just to dazzle everyone
True conviction lacks the strength of true charisma
And maybe a tear or two now
Collect the masses wherever you are
And tell them whatever they wanna hear
It's just a little lie
It's not as if you've harmed someone with your little lies
A gentle bend of the truth
Truth lies in curious places and is often found masking the lies
People want definitive answers and attentive ears hearing their cries
Promise them a born again economy, the right to choose, the right to life, whichever is stronger
Tighten your grip around the green and blue ball and don't let your conscience wander, it's just a little lie
It's not as if you've harmed someone with your little lies
A gentle bend of the truth
You've won the fight and you've won their hearts
Everything's according to plan
You've finally gotten your name engraved as the world's most powerful man
The expectations placed on you rise naked full into view
With passion words you swore to God you were made of magic and truth
Was it a little lie?
Did you know you could harm someone with your little lies?
A gentle man of the truth
Little lies
Did you know you could harm someone
With your little lies
A gentle man of the truth
