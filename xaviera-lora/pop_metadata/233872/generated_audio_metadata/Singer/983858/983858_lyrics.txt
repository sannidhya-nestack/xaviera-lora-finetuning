Walk me to the water, our feet in the sand
Let's get lost for hours, my hand in your hand
Telling our secrets, promise to keep them
Wishing on stars, giving into the feeling
Sunset silhouette slow dance pirouette feeling time slow down
Twirling around and around getting lost in what we found
Hold me to your heartbeat I wanna feel the sound
And I'm not letting go until you say you love me
More than a moment
Frozen in time
We're better together
Forever you're mine
Hold on tight to me, all feels right to me
Feeling time slow down
Swirling around and around
Getting lost in what we found
Hold me to your heartbeat
I wanna feel the sound
And I know
Letting go until you say you love me
You say those three words I've wished for so long
And I'll say I love you and I'll fall
No, I'm never letting go
Twirling around and around
Getting lost in what we found
Hold me to your heartbeat
I wanna feel the sound
And I'm not letting go
No, I'm not letting go
Twirling around
Getting lost in what we found
Hold me to your heartbeat
I wanna feel the sound
And I'm not letting go
Until you say you love me
Swirling around and around getting lost in what we found
Hold me to your heartbeat I wanna feel the sun
