Well I'm doing my best to belong here
Hands on my heart, but my head's in the clouds
And I'm looking for another way out
To satisfy my mind, and these faded walls they're closing
My heart is always open to another chance
And this feeling, oh it makes me smile
And these faded walls they're closing
My heart is always open to another chance
All this feeling, oh it makes me smile
And I ain't wasting no more time on these games
I'm too old to play around
And now you're wasting no more time and these days
I tend to run away with my runaway heart
But that's the thing about hope
It don't last here
You gotta make your own
The first thought on my mind when I wake and I open my eyes
It's not over
Well maybe I sound hopeless
Or I might be chasing ghosts but that's alright
Cause this feeling
Boy it makes me smile
And I ain't wasting no more time on these games
I'm too old to play around
And I ain't wasting no more time in these days
I tend to run away with my runaway heart
Well maybe I sound hopeless
Or I might be chasing ghosts but
But that's alright
And these faded walls they're closing
My heart is always open
To another chance, woah
But that's the thing about hope
It don't last here
You gotta make your own
Oh you gotta make your own, woah
And I ain't wasting no more time on these games
But I'm too old to play around
And I ain't wasting no more time on these days
I tend to run away with my runaway heart
And I ain't wasting no more time on these games
I'm too old to play around
And I ain't wasting no more time in these days
I tend to run away with my runaway heart
