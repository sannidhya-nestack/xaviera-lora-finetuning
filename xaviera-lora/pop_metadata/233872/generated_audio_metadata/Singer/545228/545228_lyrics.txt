There's a man I used to know
So many years ago
He used to stagger up Rose Hill
On his shoulder stood a crow
Faithful to the end
His one and only friend
He could have been Cú Chulainn
Whom the crow could not defend
From a sad and bitter fate
He stops and falls into his gate
Daughter opens up the door
Disgusted at his state
This man is known all over town
Ain't no life let him down
There's five children left to rear
But his wife's no longer there
Ah, been five years since they buried his dear
Now he buries his grief in whiskey and beer
Oh, whiskey and beer (whiskey and beer)
Whiskey and beer (whiskey and beer)
Up over Bruce Hill every night
His cries lament his plight
You can hear him loud and clear
On his shoulder Jack sits tight
He's fending all his dole
Down at the Watering Hole
The Nardese Tavern
As Smith's daughters sit there with no call
One day she'll be back
The days won't be so black, that's what Jacko keeps telling him
They're at the night when they attack
One day she'll be back, he brings for his daughters a brack
Halloween is in town, the witches are all dressed in black
Ah, they're five years since they buried his dear
Now he buries his grief in whiskey and beer
Oh whiskey and beer (whiskey and beer)
Whiskey and beer (whiskey and beer)
Oh whiskey and beer (whiskey and beer)
Whiskey and beer
Oh, Jackal sits on his shoulders and cries
She's on her way down from the sky (from the sky)
Oh, the teenagers walking by laugh
But it's really the fear in disguise of whiskey and beer
Ah, been five years since they buried his dear
Now he buries his grief in whiskey and beer
Oh, whiskey and beer (whiskey and beer)
Oh, whiskey and beer (whiskey and beer)
Oh, whiskey and beer (whiskey and beer)
Whiskey and beer
Oh, oh, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da da da da da
Da da da da da da
Da da da
Da da
