I'm waking at dawn and I'm thinking of you
you've been in my dreams and it's all I can do
To bring joy in my life and to find me some peace
From the loss of your love and the pain that won't cease
You've been here before and your grace was so real
As you opened your heart and you learned how to feel
Your skin was so soft and your eyes were so brown
As we entered a state with angelic resound
Ah, ah, ah
Follow your heart with your soulmate
Last chance, keep faith
Open up, overcome fears
Lightning strikes, Cupid appears
The lessons you taught all have come true
The trail of your soul helps me get through
And it took me a while but I finally have learned
Love comes but once and it may not return
So next time I'll know and I won't be so blind
If you ever come back if life were so kind
Cause now that I've learned and I'm paying the price
For lightning they say surely it won't strike me twice
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Follow your heart with your soulmate
Last chance, keep faith, open up
Overcoming fears
Lightning strikes
Cupid appears
Coup de Ford
The power of Zeus
Chariot of Thunder
Mythological truths
Follow your heart
With your soulmate
Last chance, keep faith
Open up, overcome fears
Lightning strikes, cupid appears
