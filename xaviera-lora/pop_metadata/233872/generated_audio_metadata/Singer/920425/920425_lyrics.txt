You're the mother of my child
You're the woman of my youth
You are beautiful and wild
You are all that's good and true
I am still in love
Only with you
One life's not enough
Heaven will make it new
Happy birthday to my queen
You're the cover of my dreams
You're the apple of my eye
You're a light that always shines
I am still in love
Only with you
One life's not enough
Heaven will make it new
I am still in love only with you
One life's not enough
Heaven will make it new
