I never wanted to hide my heart from you
You always let me state my point of view
Never wanted to take my joy away
We only wanted to live just for today
And so it goes
On and on it flows
So you and me
Are destined to be free
Like stars on high
We'll shine
Oh, we'll shine
Tonight
Ba-ba-ba-da-da-da
Ba-da
I never knew this life was so much more
Only saw the light just once before
I always heard a distant melody
To live my life the way it's meant for me
And so it goes on and on it flows
So you and me are destined to be free
Like stars on high we'll shine, oh we'll shine
So you and me are destined to be free
Like stars on high, we'll shine, oh we'll shine tonight
Nature never dwells upon the past
My love is not a question ever asked
Think of all the possibilities
Forever cast your spell rain down on me
And so it goes on and on it flows
So you and me are destined to be free
Like stars on high we'll shine, oh we'll shine
So you and me are destined to be free
Like stars on high
We'll shine, oh, we'll shine tonight
Ba-ba-ba-da-da-da, ba-da
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-da-da-da
Gonna shine, gonna shine, gonna shine tonight
Ooh, we're destined to be free
You and me
We'll shine, we'll shine, we'll shine, we'll shine
Ba-ba-da-da-da
