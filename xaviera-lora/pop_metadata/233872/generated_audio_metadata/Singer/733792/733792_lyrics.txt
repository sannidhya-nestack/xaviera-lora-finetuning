I'll call your name, I'll taste your skin
I'll breathe you in, you'll never know why
The same things you know are right
Are keeping me from losing my life
You saved me from myself
You'll never know why
You'll never know why
I'll be here for this whole night
I'll be time, you got it to me
Even when I came to you
Was getting used to the walls in my room
Now the sun no longer hurts my eyes
The same things you know are right
Are keeping me from losing my life
You saved me from myself
You never know what
You never know what
For this moment, return all you gave to me
I'll call your name
I'll taste your skin
I'll breathe you in
You never know why
You never know why
You never know why
