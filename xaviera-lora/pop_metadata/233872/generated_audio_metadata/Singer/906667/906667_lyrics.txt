They try and make a martyr out of me
And I'm falling apart down on the bowery
Singing songs like you will do you
Sing la-da-da-da, but I heard I need you
You sing la-da-da-da, but I heard I need you
No, I never thought that I could feel this way
Got me falling like the pouring rain
And the whole wide world could go up in flames
Still be falling like the pouring rain
Steady as the rain
Now they gonna make a liar out of me
I could've sworn I'd sworn off of these things
Still I hang on every word that you say
It's the sweetest sound I've heard to this day
The sweetest sound I've heard to this day
No I never thought that I could feel this way
Come here falling like a pouring rain
And the whole wide world could go up in flames
Still be falling like the pouring rain
No I never thought that I could feel this way
Come be falling like the pouring rain
And the whole wide world could go up in flames
Still be falling like the pouring rain
Steady as the rain
No, I'd never guessed that in a million years that
You'd be standing here right beside me
And I've come to see that you might be all I need
No, I never thought that I could feel this way
Could be falling like the pouring rain
And the whole wide world could go up in flames
Still be falling like the pouring rain
No, I never thought that I could feel this way
Could be falling like the pouring rain
And the whole wide world could go up in flames
Still be falling like the pouring rain
Steady as the rain
