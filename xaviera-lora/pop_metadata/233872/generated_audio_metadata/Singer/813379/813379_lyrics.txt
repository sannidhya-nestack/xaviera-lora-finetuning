Look who's back from a boiling freeze
With the wires of our nerves up their sleeve
Anxiously coming, a rush to flee
Propelling our flight to some degree
But tune us the string, neither high nor low
We can dance and sing
How we teeter
On a world of moving parts
Paradise and paradox
There's a middle way
Black is to jaded and white is to faded
We're finding shapes of grey
Guess who's mastered duality
And the tension of false dichotomy
Bowing the branch of a Bodhi tree
Tunes out the madness to some degree
But tune us the string, neither high nor low
We can dance and sing how we taught to
On a world of moving parts
Paradise in paradise
There's a middle way
Black is to jaded and white is to faded
We're finding shapes of grey
I heard my violin say
In a forest
I silently stood living
A cruel absence lay me down
Now in death I sing sweetly
Tune us to string, neither high nor low
We can dance and sing
Out to balance
On a world of moving parts
Paradise in paradox
There's a mystery
Black is to jaded and white is to faded
We're finding shakes of grey
Spectacular shades of grey
Dialectical shades of green
(Whistling)
