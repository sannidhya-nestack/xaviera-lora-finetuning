On and off, off and on
One day you're in love and the next you're alone
You work hard and you don't take a rest
You rarely get it wrong but to me you confess
You say every time I leave you get mad with me
Everywhere I go I stay away'til three
Rules follow me
I don't follow them
But it feels so good coming home again
I never realize what I fear
It's unbelievable that you're still here
Whoa, whoa
I should have stayed at home with you
Whoa, whoa
Time is loose, time is tight
Late is the hour and cold is the night
Know you're awake, I know you can't sleep
I know that you listen for the front door to creak
Well, every part of me seems to yearn for you
But I never do the thing that you need me to
Well, don't worry darling, I'll make it okay
Even though I'm gone, I haven't gone away
I never realized what I fear
It's unbelievable that you're still here
Whoa, whoa
I should have stayed at home with you
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
I should have stayed at home with you, whoa, whoa
