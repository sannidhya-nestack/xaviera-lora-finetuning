She's a fallen angel
Nothing I can do to break the spell
Taking on the world she knows so well
Wake up in the night time
Think of all the things she had before
Trying to break the devil in my soul
Found her down on a lonely street
Trying to find her way
She was in another place
Half a mile away
She's a fallen angel
Everything she knew would have to be
Living on the land and she was free
Found her down a lonely street
Trying to find her way
She was in another place
Half a mile away
Take me to where you want to go
Your tear drop eyes
Maybe you might know
I'll look out
She's a fallen angel
Look up to the sky and it was blue
Nothing she could want would ever do
Lie, die, die, die
Wake up in the night time
Think of all the things she had before
Trying to break the devil in my soul
Found her down on lonely street
Trying to find her way
She was in another place
Half a mile away
Take me to where you want to go
Your teardrop eyes maybe you might know
She's a fallen angel nothing I can do to break the spell
Taking on the world she knows so well
Lie, die, die, die, die
