Oh when you walk in
It's more than a hello
The vibe is higher than
One of their express shows
If you're feeling down
Your spirits will get a lift
Hang out
Grab that special gift
Spread the cheer
It's a Station 5
Thank you for the time
It's a Station 5
What's wonderful to be alive
So make it their home base
It's their happy place
It is called Station 5
It's a Station 5
What's wonderful to be alive
Took me alive
Mimi will show you
Round and tuck the good gab
Christie will welcome you
With one of those smiles that wraps
Even when you are
Ready to leave you stop on pause
Soaking the all time charm
Feel their silent applause
Spread that cheer
It's a Station 5
Take your fucking time
It's a Station 5
What's more hurtful to be alive?
So make it their home base
It's their happy place
It is called Station 5
It's a Station 5
What's my turn for Dirk VLA?
Dirk VLA?
Oh life, life is good here
You'll be lost in the woods but feeling good
Life is good here
It's a Station 5
Thanks for fucking time
It's a Station 5 (What's Wonderful, Dirk V .I. Live)
So make it their home base, it's their happy place
It is called Station 5
It's a Station 5 (What's Wonderful, Dirk V .I. Live)
Dirk V .I. Live
