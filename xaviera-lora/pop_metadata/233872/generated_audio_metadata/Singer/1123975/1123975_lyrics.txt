I think this would be a perfect day
If I could just have my way
See there's nothing I'd rather do
Than be with you doing nothing and
Love, when the to-do list stays undone
There's obligations to no one
You see, there's nothing I'd rather do
Than be with you doing nothing
I love to watch the hours drift by
Like the clouds in the morning sky
Oh, there's nothing I'd rather do
Than be with you doing nothing
Some friends might think it's really
Great to engage in intense debate
But there's nothing I'd rather do
Than be with you doing nothing and
Some friends might even find it
Best to climb Mount Everest
But there's nothing I'd rather do
Than be with you doing nothing
I love to watch the hours drift by
Like the clouds in the afternoon sky
Oh there's nothing I'd rather do
Than be with you doing nothing
I think this would be a perfect day
If I could just have my way
See there's nothing I'd rather do
Than be with you doing nothing
I love to watch the hours drift by
Like the clouds in the evening sky
Oh, there's nothing I'd rather do
Than be with you doing nothing
I love to watch the hours drift by
Like the clouds of the late night sky
Oh, there's nothing I'd rather do
Than be with you doing nothing
