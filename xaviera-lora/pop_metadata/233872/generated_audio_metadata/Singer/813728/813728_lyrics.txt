Candles burning at both ends
If you only knew the state I'm in
Heavy headed, drags on down
Just another day at 6am
See the red in my eyes
Feel the weight of my skin
See a man in disguise
This is the state I'm in
At six a .m.
At six a .m.
I'm pressed between the start and end
A bitter foe, a trusted friend
I think I'm running late again
Just another day at 6am
At 6am
I don't mess with a man, I just mess with a dog, you know, that's what I'm talking about
