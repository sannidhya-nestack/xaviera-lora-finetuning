Dancers always dance with the heat
If you let me deep inside you
I whisper softly, please
Will you let me see you through reflections of the stars?
Your deepest thoughts reveal exactly
You let me feel you
Fingers touching soft your skin
Spirit moving toward my love
Spirit carried by wind
I'll shower you with moonbeams
Dance as I always dance for thee
If you let me deep inside you
I will whisper softly, please
Could you lend me knowledge
Of the truth that sets you free
But also share the shadows
Of your distant barren
Love, you let me feel you
Fingers touching soft your skin
Spirit moving toward my love
Spirit carried by wind
I'll shower you with moonbeam
Dance the slowest dance of these
If you let me deep inside you
Heart whisper softly
I'll shower you with moonbeam
Dance is all it stands to be
If you like me deep inside you
I whisper softly, please
