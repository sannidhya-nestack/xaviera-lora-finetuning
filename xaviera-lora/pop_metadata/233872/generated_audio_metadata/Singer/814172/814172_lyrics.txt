Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Stand in ovation, stand in ovation you deserve
A stand in ovation tonight
You look lost, sad and lonely
In the spotlight, on the stage
Taking your last curtain call
Like a stoning on parade
A starring role
The victim plays
Strings in serenade
Stand in ovation, stand in ovation, you deserve a stand in ovation tonight
You have earned for the role you play in life
You deserve a standing ovation tonight
Applause and decrescendo
Acting out to pull us in
Nailed to an illusion
Painted on a righteous grin
The silence of an empty house
Echoes deep beneath your skin
Stand in ovation
Stand in ovation
You deserve
A stand in ovation tonight
You ever earn for the toll you pay in life?
A curtain falls around you
The show's come to an end
Usher in a closet drama
Till auditions come again
Stand in ovation, stand in ovation, you deserve a standing ovation tonight
A new heaven for the role we play in life
You deserve a standing ovation tonight
