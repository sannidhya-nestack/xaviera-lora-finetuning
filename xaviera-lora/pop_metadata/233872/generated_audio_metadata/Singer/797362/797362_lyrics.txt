These are my hands that you're holding
These are my hands
This is my world that you're spinning
Round and around
This is my love that I'm giving
Right from the start
This is your last invitation
This is my heart
Love is me and you
At a table for two
Love is what you do
I'd do it all for you
Matter of the heart
This is my love that I'm giving
Right from the start
This is your last invitation
This is my heart
Love is me and you
At the table for two
Love is what you do
I'd do it all for you
Love is me and you
At a table for two
Love is what you do
I'd do it all for you
