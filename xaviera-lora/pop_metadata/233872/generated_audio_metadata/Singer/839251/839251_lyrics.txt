Oh now something from me through me
Wait a while think about nothing start again and never end
It don't seem that far to me
Take one step up on a week
Come back home and I'll see
It's a long way to go
Wait a while
Think about
And then start again
Never ends, no now
Some figure far enough to start again
Never ending
And it don't seem that far to me
Take one step I'm gonna weak
Come back home and all I see is a long way to go
And it don't seem that far to me
Take one step I'm gonna weak
Come back home and all I see is a long way to go
And it don't seem that far to me
Take one step I'm gone a week
Come back home and all I see
It's a long way to go
And it don't seem that far to me
Take one step I'm gone a week
Come back home and all I see
It's a long way to go
