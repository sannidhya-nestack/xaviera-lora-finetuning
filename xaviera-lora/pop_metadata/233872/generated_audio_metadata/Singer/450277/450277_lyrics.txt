Old wounds are hard to heal
Wrestling with painful sights
Kneeling face down on my scars
Through the fever and the fright
Strolling down the path
Passing by old sins
Muffling up the painful past
Hope a new life begins
Saw the perfect poem
Floating free, forming the sky
Felt so much like home
Will I live or die
Sweeping up glass shards of my life
Caught you peeking through my dreams
Was that a wink from your eye
Chasing around all through the night
What's gone by seems like a lie
Saw the perfect poem
Floating free forming the sky
Felt so much like home
Will I live or die
Sweeping up glass shards of my life
Restoration best can be
Hopping on the life-go-round
Setting sail to better seas
Listening to improved sounds
Saw the perfect poem
Floating free, forming the sky
Felt so much like home
Will I live or die?
Swiping up glass shards of my life
Of my life
