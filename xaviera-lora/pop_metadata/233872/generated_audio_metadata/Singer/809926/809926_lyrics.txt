Come on people now
We can get together
We can get together
And have a good time
It's all physical
You've got to get up now
You've got to stand up for what you believe
I ain't wasting no more time
On silly things
we are always honest
'Cause we are always honest about these things
We got to get up now
We got to stand up
We can't hold it down
Drip until the last drop
So full of this stuff
It's so incredible
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
We fight for what we believe, yeah
Stand up and we can achieve it
So bust down that door
this is a war
And remember we swore
We won't take it no more
I ain't wasting no more time
On silly things
we are always honest
'Cause we are always honest about these things
We got to get up now, we got to stand up
We can't hold it down, drip until the last drop
Don't put a fist up, it's so incredible
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I ain't wasting no more time on silly things

We got to get up now
We got to stand up
We can't hold it down
Drip until the last drop
So put up this stunt
