Walk away, cause I pretend
Say the words you don't stand a chance no more
Well go ahead, take the steps
Realize I don't have your back no more
Just to be sure
Is it love? Is it power? Is it blood?
Is the way, the way we walked, the way we should?
Walk with me, discover all the roads
And tell me some, tell the way it goes
I've been loving you, I don't know the way it shows
Just walk with me, discover all the roads
Leave me now, walk alone
Throw it all back on your own again
Feel your groove, make you move, I don't care
Watch me if I go again
Is it love? Is it power? Is it blood?
Is the way, the way we walked, the way we shared?
Just walk with me, discover all the roads
And tell me some, tell the way it goes
I've been loving you, I don't know the way it shows
Just walk with me, discover all the roads
Just walk with me, discover all the roads
And tell me some, and tell the way it goes
I've been loving you, I don't know the way it shows
Just walk with me, discover all the roads
