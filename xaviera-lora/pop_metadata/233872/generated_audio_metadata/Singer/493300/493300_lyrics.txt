My glottal stop gives me away
A storm in a teacup with nothing much brewing
I never liked that Earl Grey
The things that you say
Sometimes they get in the way
The things that you're doing
Demons with books in a row
The singing along to the songs that you're playing
I never listened in school
The things that you do
Sometimes they get in the way
The things that you're saying
Things to remember and things to et
But no time for all this regret and reliving
So much ahead of you, so much behind
Keeping your balance while walking the Y
Flying your flag any colour you like
Happy as sin in the middle of life
La la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la la, la la la la
My knife and fork give me away
They're in the wrong hands and my manners are fading
Searching for that silver spoon
The things you don't do
Sometimes they get in the way
Of changes you're making
People to hold on to
People to let go
And time for all this et and ive it
So much within you and so much without
So much to learn from, whisper and shout
Rough round the edges but softer inside
Getting stuck in to the middle of life
You know where you've been in the middle of life
Watch me jump in to the middle of life
La la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la
La la la la
La la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la
La la la la
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
