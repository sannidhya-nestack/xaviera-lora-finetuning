The blue sky never seemed so blue
I'm so high just thinking about you
I don't know what it is, can't hide it
I don't know what it is but I like it
And I wonder will it always be this way
And I wonder will we always feel the same
A whisper in my ear
And the whole world disappears
And I wonder
Will it always be this way?
The kiss is like a sweet lullaby
Lost in a dream, don't say goodnight
I don't know what it is, can't hide it
I don't know what it is, but I like it
And I wonder, will it always be this way?
And I wonder, will we always feel the same?
A whisper in my ear
The whole world disappears
And I wonder
Will it always be this way?
And I know a place I can escape with you (with you, with you)
Drifting in space, high above the world with you
And I wonder, will it always be this way?
And I wonder, will we always feel the same? (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whisper in my ear, the whole world disappears (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And I wonder, will it always be this way?
