I met a man in my late teens
He said I'm gonna conquer the world
Before he finished I could tell from his laugh
He'd been living this way most of his life
Hand on his heart and a tear as he cries
His persona is a public disguise
He drank from his cup and finished it up
Said now listen boy now listen real hard
My lungs might be broke and my liver might be dying
But my heart's full of love and my head's always trying
But so stay cold and my beard gets longer
my feet are firmly rooted in this earth that ages older
Money's not an issue'cause my issue grew a tree
But I'd be a better man just like my father said I'd be
When it's dark you light a candle when you're sad you try to handle
When you've messed up what love gives you're only out and maybe in love
We're only out to maybe end love
I met a lady in my late teens
She came in hard and ripped out my heart
Clenched it firmly between two fists
In love I guess I swung and I missed
But nothing's as bad when really I had a misfortune
I've never been a sucker for life
But if life is a gift then the gift is a bitch and the bitch isn't for me
I've had my fair share of two of those
My lungs might be broke and my liver might be dying
But my heart's full of love and my head's always trying
My toes stay cold and my beard gets longer
my feet are firmly rooted and it's that the age is older
Money's not an issue'cause my issue grew a tree
But I'd be a better man just like my father said I'd be
When it's dark you light a candle
When you're sad you try to handle
When you rest up what love gives
You're only out and maybe in love
Only out to maybe in love
My lungs might be broke and my liver might be dying
But my heart's full of love and my head's always trying
My toes stay cold and my beard gets longer
my feet are firmly rooted in this earth that ages older
Money's not an issue'cause my issue grew a tree
But I'd be a better man just like my father said I'd be
When it's dark you light a candle when you're sad you try to handle
When you've messed up what life gives you're only out to make me in love
Only out and maybe in love
