I wonder if the birds
Wonder if the birds
Sometimes feel tired
Of their wings
Everything gets worn
I don't believe it though it can't be
Not to me
And to find me there
Where reality's been shaded
I'll be what remains
Of your dreams when they've just faded
And I guess that's my fate
I'll make slippers of myself
I'll make slippers of myself
I'll make slippers of myself
Then I'll be
Golden rain
What if we woke up
What if we woke up one fine morning
And walked away
Like we weren't born
Like we didn't long for one more day
Or need to stay?
And we'd know it's grace
it couldn't be any better
Than we'd understand
What we meant in all those letters
But I can't change our
We are sea waves in a shell
Oh, we are sea waves in a shell
Oh, we are sea waves in a shell
Let it be
Golden red
