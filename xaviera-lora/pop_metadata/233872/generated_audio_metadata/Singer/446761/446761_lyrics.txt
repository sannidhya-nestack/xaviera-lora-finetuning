My life was once all full of hope
I danced beneath the stars at night
My life was once all full of love
You helped me live inside the light
My life was once all full of dreams
I saw you in the night and day
My hopes and dreams they sprang from you
You showed the wisdom and the way
But Lord I took an awful fall
I strayed far off the path
I feel so lost inside
I fear my hopes may die
See you in my dreams
You taught me how to live
I learned your lessons very well
I've shattered all my hopes and dreams
Show me the light so I can see
You taught me right from wrong (taught me right from wrong)
You taught me how to share (taught me how to share)
I've lost the life that I once knew
I've lost the love that rang so true
But Lord I took it all full form
I strayed far off the path
I feel so lost inside
I fear my hopes may die
I can only see you in my dreams
I'm struggling for daylight
The tunnel is so dark
I can't make it without you
I need the love inside your heart
Cause Lord I took an awful fall
I strayed far off the path
I feel so lost inside
I fear my hopes may die
See you in my dreams
I can only see you in my dreams
