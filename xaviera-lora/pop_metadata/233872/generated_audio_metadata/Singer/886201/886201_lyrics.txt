Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Stand up for yourself girl
Don't let'em talk to you like that
Stand up for yourself girl
Don't let'em treat you like that
Stand up for yourself, girl
You're nobody's doormat
Stand up for yourself, girl
You're worth way more than that
Maybe they told you you can't
Maybe they said you'd never last
Maybe they made you feel like you'd never be enough
Maybe you thought they were right
Stand up for yourself girl
Don't let'em talk to you like that
Stand up for yourself, girl
Don't let'em treat you like that
Oh, stand up for yourself, girl
You're nobody's doormat
Stand up for yourself, girl
You're worth way more than that
Oh, you'll get the last laugh
You'll learn how to stand
Oh, you'll give the world just what it needs, just what it needs
When you realize you can't
Stand up for yourself (oh, you're worth way more than that)
Stand up for yourself (you're worth way more than that)
Stand up for yourself (you're worth way more than that)
Stand up for yourself (No words, no aim more than that)
Stand up for yourself (No words, no aim more than that)
Stand up for yourself (No words, no aim more than that)
Stand up for yourself (Stand up for yourself)
Bitch, girl, girl
Stand up for yourself, mmm, no
Stand up for yourself
Stand up for yourself
