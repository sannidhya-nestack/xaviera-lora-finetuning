I don't know what to say, except that I'm happy for you in every way
Knew from the first day you were the special one, and that you'd be okay
Shine your light this way, it'll all be okay
I'll borrow your angel for a day, like would you stay?
With a sad parade to Quintalola
I'm looking for sun
Seeing them everywhere
Proving that I'll be fine
For now I can relax
Saw the same green car today
Three times on Fairfax
Shine your light this way
It'll all be okay
I'll borrow your age
Angel for a day, tell me his name, will he love me the same?
Give grace to my longing, my longings
All is bona fide, darling, you are a star
Proud to be on your side
Know you are always loved
It's not the part you play but the man you've become
Shine your light this way, it'll all be okay
I'll borrow your age
Angel for a day, light would it stay? With you I pray to quench all your longing, your longings
