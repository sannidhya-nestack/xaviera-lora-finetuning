So many years ago, everyone was hard to know
Today my heart is open though, yeah I let it go
So many years ago, now I've come to be someone else
The roof was lifted and I can tell
Yeah things are different for me now
Different than so many years ago
Why does time pass this way? I can't see it have this effect on me
We become what we are now
Not what we were so many years ago
So many years ago
Oh that was so many years ago
So many years ago
Life was what it was gonna be
But now that's here and what we see
If I only knew so many years ago
Why does time pass this way
I can't see it have this effect on me
We become what we are now
Not what we were so many years ago
So many years ago
Oh that was so many years ago
So many years ago, everyone was hard to know
Today my heart is open though, yeah I let it go
So many years ago, now I've come to be someone else
The roof was lifted and I can tell
Yeah, things are different for me now
Different than so many years ago
Why does time pass this way? I can't see it have this effect on me
We become what we are now, not what we were so many years ago
So many years ago
Oh, that was so many years ago
So many years ago
Oh that was so many years ago
