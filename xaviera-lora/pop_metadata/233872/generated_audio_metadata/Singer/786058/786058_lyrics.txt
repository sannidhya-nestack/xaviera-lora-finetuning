The television dumbs us instead of fighting all the time
When our words cut through each other taking casualties of mine
But we hide inside our reasons why we carry on this way
It is easier to fool ourselves than face the darker day
We've made some bad decisions
And now they grind us to the bone
Choosing apathy as normal
To mute the terror of alone
So we live a life of passionless exchanges in the hall
And I can't help but to wonder
Is this really worth it all?
Should I stay or should I go?
Should I just stand still hoping for something more
I can't even try
Cause there's no way
We're coming back from here
Where you and I went wrong
Where you and I went wrong
Where you and I went wrong
Where you and I went wrong
Wrong
Together in this vicious state
We are running out of time
We are searching for the nerve to say no and leave this all behind
The feeling overwhelming
We should've stopped this years ago
All the damage that we're doing
How were we to know
That we'd spend a lifetime running
From the things that make us cry
We need to break this thing apart
And now start asking why
There's never anything to say
Just daggers in our eyes
I never wanted this
I never wanted this
Should I stay
Will you go
Or will you insist on waiting for something more
Don't even try
Cause there's no way
We're coming back from here
Where you and I went wrong
Yeah you and I went wrong
Where you and I went wrong
Where you and I went wrong
