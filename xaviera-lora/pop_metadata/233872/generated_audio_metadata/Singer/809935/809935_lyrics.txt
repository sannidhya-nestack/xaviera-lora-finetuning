Hey come on let's go outside
The weather is nice just for you and I
It's about time we said hi to the sun
A rainbow is a sorry for a stormy sky
I can smell the rain it's the reason why
The flowers grow we can't deny our love
The sand and the sea and the sun and the wind
These are the things that I believe in
Soothe my soul I think it's my therapy
So take a deep breath it's yours to keep
You and I are gonna make it no matter how steep
And we could find a place somewhere and live in peace
It's alright let yourself be happy once in a while
Open your heart to what's around
There's beauty everywhere, it's true
You can choose to see it through
Dan, join this moment
Enjoy this moment, moment, moment
Love is all around, it's a beautiful thing
And I'll be on their side like the lines from Dr. King
hate's too great a burden to bear
But time is always right to do what's right
You and I can live like this and sleep at night
All we have to do is care
It's alright, let yourself be happy once in a while
Open your heart to what's around
There's beauty everywhere it's true
You can choose to see it through
Enjoy this moment
Enjoy this moment, moment, moment
Enjoy this moment, it's what we got, it's who we are
We live and breathe, look at those stars, fire, fire, sing a song
We have the power, get this moment, momentum's ours, we are right
We will win our future's bright
Play the time, see us beat
Skill the force so you can see
Time is now, we can't wait
It's been years, don't hesitate
Legends are, we are right
We will win our future's bright
