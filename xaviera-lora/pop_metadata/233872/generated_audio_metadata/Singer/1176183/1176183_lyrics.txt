Sometimes I cry about how much I love us two
You fit just like a glove
I know I'm not outgrowing you
When life sweeps us away
We might not speak for days
But we catch up and talk
And it's just like where we left off
And I know you
Inside and out, around and around
And you know me
Page after page, you read everyday
Sometimes I think about the days we went to town
And drove around in circles dreaming about where we are now
And I know you
Inside and out, around and around
And you know me
Page after page, you read every day
We hear each others banter all the thinking out loud but
We laugh until we hurt ourselves and then laugh after it
When winter comes and life goes numb we're
At each others door ready to sit
I'm grateful for the day we found each other's way
Into our ever future'cause we both know we're here to stay
