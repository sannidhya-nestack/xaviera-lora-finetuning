Feelings of dread
It's a long way home
And I don't want to die
It's a long way to go
From here until night
It's a long way home
Give it my best try
Surrender all my mind tonight
Surrender I just might tonight
Blank stares indifferent
Mildly inking words to a page
The casual participant
Waiting for someone
To wake up their rage
It's a long way home
And I don't wanna die
It's a long way to go
From here until night
It's a long way home
Give it my best try
Surrender all my mind tonight
Surrender I just might tonight
It's a long, long road to the place where we're meant to be
Way home
And I don't wanna die
It's a long way to go
From here until night
And it's a long way home
I'll give it my best try
Surrender all my mind
Tonight
Surrender, I just might
Tonight
Blues on the radio
Silently sinking
Thoughts in my head
