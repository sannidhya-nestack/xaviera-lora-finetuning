Life's turning, we've come to a place
Where secrets are told
Life's turning, we've come face to face
You must let me know
If you want it, you can have it
If you want it, let me know
If you want it, you can have it
If you don't, then let me go
Afraid of the look in your eyes
Speak and be heard
Afraid of the truth that they hide
Give me your word
If you want it, you can have it
If you want it, let me know
If you want it, you can have it
If you don't, then let me go
If you want it, you can have it
If you want it, if you want it
If you want it
You can have it if you, if you want
If you want it (If you want it)
You can have it (You can have it)
If you want it (If you want it)
Oh, yeah, oh (If you want it)
You can have it (You can have it)
If you don't (If you don't)
Then don't let me go
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
