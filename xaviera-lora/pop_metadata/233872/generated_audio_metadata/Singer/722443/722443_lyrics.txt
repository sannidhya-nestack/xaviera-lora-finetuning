I see nothing but sky when I look above me
I see nothing but sky
And I have nothing but hope for the days to come
I have nothing but hope
I'll spend my days trying to fix all my mistakes
And the wind will carry my song
I'll find a way, I'll find a place to stay
And if the sky allows, I'll call it home
And I need nothing but truth for the world around me
I need nothing but truth
And I see nothing but sky when I look above me
I see nothing but sky
I'll rest my voice, I'll be running from the noise
And the wind will carry my song
But I'll find a way, I'll find a place to stay
And if the sky alarms, I'll call it home
I'll spend my days trying to learn from my mistakes
And the wind will carry my song
But I'll find a way, I'll find a place to stay
And if the sky alarms
I'll call it home
I call it home
