Speak if your heart is in it
If your mind is listening to the words you please
Bleed colors of this language
But if you're feeling anguished
Girl don't say a thing
Don't speak
If you can't find the words then darling breathe me
In love
In love
Leave sentences behind you
Let my love remind you
Everything you need
And free, free the voice inside you
No it don't define you
I don't need your speech
Don't speak
If you can't find the words then darling breathe me
In love
In love
Don't speak
If you can't find the words then darling breathe me
In love
In love
