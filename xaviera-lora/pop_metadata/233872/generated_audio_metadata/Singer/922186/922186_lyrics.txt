Every time I see you here
It seems to me you disappear
Well life is hard and things are crazy
You could always be my baby
And life can often make you wrong
Make you jump before the gun
But what we need is just to believe
In these moments to stop and breathe
And if there was no future and there was no past
Would you take this moment and make it last
I know that I would, I would
Yeah, love someone or rush on by
Time is just some alibi
Where some simple things are so hard to find
Just take this moment, free your mind
And if there was no future and there was no past
Would you take this moment and make it last
I knew that I would
Take the sun down from above
Together we could
We could
Every moment my friend we must enjoy
Love is the only power we need to rejoice
And if there was no future and there was no past
Would you take this moment and make it last
I know that I would
Take the sun down from above
Together we could
In harmony and love
In love, love, love, love, love, love
Yeah and if there was no future and there was no past would you
Take this moment and make it last
I knew that I would
Take the sun down from above
Together we could
We could
