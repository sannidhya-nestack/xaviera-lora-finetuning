I could tell you I'm sorry
I can't tell you why
Got a handful of reasons
I suppose I could sell
An excuse, it's just a lie
That we tell ourselves
I could tell you I'm different
But I don't feel that way
Got a heart full of intentions
I repeat with each breath
Even the best of intentions
Dies a real quick death
I swore to myself I'd never let you down
I swore to myself and figured out
I swore to myself I'd never be like him
But here I am
Can't tell the difference
I keep trying to change
They say I'll start today
Got these lines around my eye
Forever
Oh destiny means nothing'til you're caught in its way
So to myself, never let you down
I soar up and down
I figure it out
I swore to myself
I'd never be like him
But here I am
Here I am
Can't tell the difference
