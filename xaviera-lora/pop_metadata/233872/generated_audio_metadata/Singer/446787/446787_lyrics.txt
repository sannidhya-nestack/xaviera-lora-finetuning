Sometimes in winter
When the cold is all around
I can feel you with me
I feel your warmth so
You're inside my dream
You're with me tonight
Dream with me all night
Sometimes in springtime
I hear you softly in
Whispering love songs
The voice that I long to hear
I need your comfort tonight
Whisper love songs to me
Answer my dreams tonight
I see your silhouette so
Thinking of you tonight
If you could only know
Sometimes in summer
With water lapping out
Sun-speckled daydreams
Harken your very allure
In my dreams tonight
Come to my shore
In my dreams tonight
Sometimes in autumn
As the leaves begin to fall
Your love surrounds me
It's the only cure I know
Bring your love to me
I need your cure tonight
Inside my dreams you'll be
In the moonlight
I see your silhouette so
Thinking of you tonight
If you could only know
If you could only know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
