A gunshot rings across the waves
Like a heart slapped to your face
When your heart's ripped open wide
It's hard to see the other side
There's a mother crying
Another son dying
Black and blue it's all the same
You can change
Or you can find someone to blame
But pointing fingers never ease your pain
You can fight
Set fire to the night
An eye for an eye only makes us blind
Time to practice what we pray
Here's to better days
Pictures painted on the tube
Hard to tell what is the truth
They can spin it how they like
Building why the great divide
There's a preacher singing
The politicians digging
Black and blue it's all a game
You can change
Or you can find someone to blame
But pointing fingers never ease your pain
You can fight
Set fire to the night
An eye for an eye only makes us blind
Time to practice what we pray
Oh, it's the better days
Aren't you tired
How they conspire
To fan the flames
We're all in this
Without iveness
We'll never find a way
You can change
Or you can find someone to blame
But pointing fingers never ease your pain
And you can't fight
Set fire to the night
But an eye for an eye only makes us blind
Time to practice what we pray
Here's to better days
Here's to better days
