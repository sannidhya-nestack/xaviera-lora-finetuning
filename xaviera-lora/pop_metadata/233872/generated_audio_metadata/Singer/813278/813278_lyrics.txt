Wasn't it cold when I wrote your name down in coal
Just before it rained and then that snow
Drifted as it does long and slow
Circles above what
The seasons come and go
Like you but we both know
The way the cycle plays out
When it's time for you to show up
Will you twist and escape it
And try to bring it back but
You just kick and it's deflected
You're circling again
When you spin
We're disconnected
I'll never understand
The way you move
In spirals away from me
We'll cut the right day
Or a new time of year
Change the fate
Of these rosy frozen years
And you say
Just what I want to hear
And I'm helpless or
Or so I fear
You twist and escape it
I've tried to bring it back but
You just kick and dis deflect it
You're circling again
When you spin we're disconnected
I'll never understand the way you move
In spirals away from me
Will you twist and escape it
I've tried to bring it back
But you just kick and it's deflected
You're circling again
When you spin we're disconnected
I'll never understand the way you move in
Spirals away from me
