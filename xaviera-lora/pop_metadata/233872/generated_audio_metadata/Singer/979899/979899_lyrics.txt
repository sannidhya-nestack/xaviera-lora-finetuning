Lonely, can anyone hear me?
I don't think a witch on the sky
But the stars seem, seem to be laughing at me
Reaching hard on my sleeve, is it beating?
You just got here and you're leaving
Winning a battle to lose the war
Used to be glitter, used to be in love
I used to sparkle and never asked why
Used to be diamonds, used to be strong
Used to know everything, now I'm all wrong
Broken, left my love out in the open
Trying to feel but I'm frozen
All that I knew I don't know
I won't cry by myself and no you won't
Keep me on your shelf and there you go
Winning a battle to lose the war
Used to be glitter
Used to be love
I used to sparkle and never asked why
Used to be diamonds, used to be strong
Used to know everything, now I'm all wrong
The story's built out
Of all the battles we waged with ourselves
All that we lost to be somebody else
Wave in a flag and I'll draw my sword
And win the war
I can be glitter
I can be light
I still got sparkle
And now I know why
I am still diamonds
I am still strong
I used to know everything, now I'm all wrong, now I'm all wrong, now I'm all wrong, now I'm all wrong
