I lay back with my head down
Trying not to sleep
I'm watching how stars collide
And the darkness in between
Is it midnight shadows
Fooling with my head
Is it midnight shadows
Or maybe I'm misled
If you're there in the twilight
Come I'll show your heart
Put the shades up
Let the light in
Don't get lost in the
Is it midnight's shadows
Fulling with my head
Is it midnight's shadows
Or maybe I'm misled
Shadows
Leave me there
In the shadows
Leave me there
Every now and then I catch a trace of you
But it never remains
A phantom in the darkness
I can't explain
Is it midnight's shadows
Fooling with my head
Is it midnight's shadows
Oh maybe
Is that you there in the shadows
Fooling with my head
Just midnight shadows
Or is that you
