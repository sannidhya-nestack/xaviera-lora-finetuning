And did you notice that I didn't speak today
And all the words I say are just thoughts in my memory
And all I wish for is the calm words
And can it ever be the same again
And some things you say, I don't wanna hear
Let's just play again, oh you all over again
And some things you do, I don't wanna do
Let's just not be strangers anymore
And did you notice that I didn't sleep tonight
The bed is big but just as empty
And all I wish for is that good night
And can it ever be the same again
And some things you say, I don't wanna hear
And let's just break and know you all over again
And some things you do, I don't wanna do
But let's just not be strangers anymore
And some things you say I don't wanna hear
Let's just play again, oh you and all over again
And some things you do I don't wanna do
Let's just not be strangers anymore
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) (S-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-Snappy
Oh
Some things you say, I don't wanna care
Let's just play again, oh you all over again
Some things you say, I don't wanna care
Let's just play again, oh you all over again
