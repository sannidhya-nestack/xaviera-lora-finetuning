You drew a line and I tried to follow you
You said goodbye and it was only for a moment
We passed into the grey
Words we haven't spoken for such a long, long time
you drew a line and I tried to follow
Beautiful, all that you are
Wonderful, wandering blue
You and I, stuck in all our crazy ways
Dancing at the edge of the world for a moment
All that you love will be carried away, carried away
You are the prettiest morning
And I will not et you
Stars were falling from the sky
And you held my hand
Perfectly broken in two
Now we live in my memory
Beautiful all that you do
You drew a line and I could not follow you
