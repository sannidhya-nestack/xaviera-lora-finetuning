I've been thinking about the force of thought
Been wondering why we turn away from goodness
As the weight of life comes falling down
Do we realize we're dropping where the wind blows?
Heh heh
When I think about these days gone by
It echo patters memories in my mind
This flesh that comes and hears it just so simply tears in with the soul
Privacy is mental
Where's my big solution?
Nowhere to run
There's nowhere to hide
As I linger in and out making puddles of your memory circles
Castles dormant in the wind while the feeble grumble there's no resolution
Well I don't know where I belong but I belong here right now
Tilling landmarks through the earthlit dark
While my grey walls water through this day
I don't have no answer
No petty solution
For this mind pollution
There's nowhere to run
There's nowhere to hide
La la dee da dee da da da da da
