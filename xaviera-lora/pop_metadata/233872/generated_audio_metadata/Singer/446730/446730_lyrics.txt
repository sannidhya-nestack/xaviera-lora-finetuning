Whose strings are these that lift my arms
What are these dreams that work their charms
We're dancing meters in bright red clothes
We entertain on tippy toes
Look at this look at me
Wish I knew just how to be
You shake my hand and I walk like this
You only see external bliss
And our acting is deserving
All the love that's in your heart
And you're clapping'cause you're happy
To see the marionettes march
We entertain you and sustain you as we fill our life's crusade
You fail to see our tears inside the Mayan nights parade
I want so much to be so real
And feel those things that people feel
I need so much to have a heart
And not to live a world apart
Pull my string, make me sing
Make me do amazing things
Let me fly and don't ask why
I hide the sadness deep inside
I'm happy when I'm on the stage
That's when I feel I've got it made
So sad when I'm back on the shelf
And must deny my one true self
Our acting is deserving
Of the love that's in your heart
And you're clapping'cause you're happy
To see the marionettes march
We entertain you and sustain you as we fill our life's crusade
But you fail to see our tears inside
You fail to see those tears inside
You fail to see my tears inside
The marionette's parade
