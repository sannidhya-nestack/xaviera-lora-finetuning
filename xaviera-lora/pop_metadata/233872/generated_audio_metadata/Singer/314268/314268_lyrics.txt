There are miracles all around us
There is poetry in our dreams
But it's easy to overlook treasures
When we're lost in our daily routines
We can spend our lives chasing what we long for
And sacrifice love that we don't have time for
And never know that our souls cry out for
What's right there all the time
And that's a little inspiration now and then
A little sweet inspiration
All I need to get me through is you
And a little sweet inspiration
Now the world is awash in confusion
This no one would ever deny
And it's hard to have faith in the future
When we're carving great holes in the sky
We can mourn for what this world has come to
And curse the ones we try to turn to
But I think I am here to learn to
Reach out and sing for you
With just a little inspiration now and then
A little sweet inspiration
All I need to get me through is you
And a little sweet inspiration
When the world falls heavy on my shoulders (When the world turns angry and cold)
A little inspiration shines the light (A little inspiration)
To paint the world in crimson and gold (Comes unshining into my heart)
Chase away the demons in the night (To brighten my life and guide my way back home)
There are prophecies in the thunder
There are diamonds in the grass
There are minuets in the moonlight
Inviting us to come out dance
Now as life goes by, we become aware of
The few things that we can be sure of
The steady glow of our deep and pure love
Blows the rest away
And a little inspiration now and then
A little sweet inspiration
All I need to get me through
Is the courage to speak what I know is true
A little help from my friends and some help from you
And a little sweet inspiration
