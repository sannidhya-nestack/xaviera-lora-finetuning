R .B. Jones
Yeah yeah yeah
Do do do do do do do do do
This is fear to the beat
Do you remember
The first time I noticed you
We knew we knew
Hey do you remember
The way that I held you
And told you I love you
Cause I remember
The smell of your sweet perfume
How it lingers in my room
And I remember
The way you used to be
But now you never be
So baby tell me why
Hey oh why, why'd you lie to me?
It didn't have to be this way
But now, oh now, now I can see
Oh I'm gonna miss those days
You, you remember
The first time that I saw your smile
I knew right then you were mine
Do you remember
When I looked into your eyes
Oh how I felt like I was in paradise
I remember
You said you'd never lie to me
Cheat on me or hurt me
And I remember
The way that it used to be
But, but, but now we can never be
So baby, tell me why, oh why
Why'd you lie to me
It didn't have to be this way
But now, oh now
Now I can see
Oh how I'm gonna miss those days
I remember, I remember, I remember, I remember, I remember, I remember
I remember, I remember, I remember the way, yeah
I thought you was my down woman
From the ground woman
Move out my circle I don't need you around
Want me playing with a shark
I'm just saying from the start
Girl you fooled me with your mind
You was playing with my heart
You didn't have the faith
All the promises you broke'em
For every single problem
I just roll'em up and smoke'em
It's like you didn't read
Please I ain't finna plead
Too much to handle, extra baggage I didn't need
Always cussin' and fussin'
Two faces, you all lost all my trust in
I can't get to sky, baby, you gon' miss on fly
You can't call me a liar, I'm not rich or prime
Can't bust me with the proof, adjust me, what's the use?
Didn't believe in others, trust me, I'm the truth
I got a lesson for you, thought I wasn't blessed for you
Not at all, but I got a question for you
Why? Oh why?
Why did you lie to me?
It didn't have to be this way
But now, oh now
Now I can see
Oh how I'm gonna miss those days
