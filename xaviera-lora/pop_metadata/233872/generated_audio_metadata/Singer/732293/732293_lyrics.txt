Hey there buddy can you give me a light
Been passing state lines since yesterday night
Gotta keep that fire burning for Zane Augustine
Said the man on the phone said he'd help me start clean
Got in a little trouble up in Lewiston, Maine
Passing bad checks and the DA rained
Then I found a cache of weapons they gave me five to ten
But I got paroled in six and now I'm on the road again
And can you show me to the nearest all night laundrette
And who's idea were these moist towelettes
Got a'81 Toyota with the drag-ass springs
Put the hammers to the floor to see if Florida sings
And it's a long, long, long odds again
And it's a long, long, longer
Till I can look back from then
I drown in chain store coffee to keep from freezing
This thousand mile drive ain't been no Garden of Eden
I'm praying the authority keeps watching over me
And the next motel's got a workin' TV
They said the job's mine if I arrive alive
Be drivin' route sales from eight thirty to five
I thought I'd call her Louise but she ain't talkin' to me
She's still waitin' knee deep in the old debris
Well, it was up in Ontario in'79
We had a good business, a good credit line
But we blew it all away, stepping way beyond our means
And when I pawned her mother's ring, it came apart at the seams
And it's a long, long, long odds again
And it's a long, long, longer'til I can look back from then
I'm standing in this restroom smoking by the mirror
Wondering where I'm gonna be an hour from here
Got a Gulf Coast promise at the end of the line
I got nothing to lose and what I'm hoping to find
You can telephone Louise and say I'm looking ahead
I'm still hoping one day to serve her breakfast in bed
I'm believing that scenario's gonna ring true
And I'll say one day that I did it for you
And it's a long, long, long odds again
And it's a long, long, longer
Till I can look back from then
And it's a long, long, long odds again
It's a long, long, longer
Till I can look back from then
