Sunset in the rear view
Fading sky ahead
Will the long ride through the darkness
Be worth it in the end
Oh
When I get there, oh
When I get there, what will I find
After all, all this time
When I get there
All these wheels keep turning
And the past still leaves a taste
Will I find my heart's desire
When we're standing face to face
Oh, when I get there
Oh
When I get there
What will I find
After all this time
And maybe
Life will turn a new page and maybe
Everything will be the same and maybe someday
Oh, when I get there
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
When I get there
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
When I get there
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
When I get there
What will I find after all, all this time
When I get there, when I get there
Woah oh oh oh oh
When I get there
(Where I find it, where I find it)
When I get there
(Cover my whole society)
When I get there
When I, when I get there, whoa
