You like it best when I hold your left hand
You eat your ice cream even when it's got sand
I'm learning little things about you
But I'm missing something, something, something
You like long naps with my hand on your chest
You write puns just to get me impressed
You're doing little things so cute
I'm falling slowly, slowly, slowly
My heart will rush things on
You're feeling me well
This way it goes on and on, oh
Make me your ecstasy
I wanna feel all the ways you breathe
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Make me your ecstasy
I wanna feel all the ways you breathe
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
You know I sing in the car and jam out
You know I like when you wear button downs
You're learning little things about me
Are you missing something, something, something?
My heart will rush things on
You're filling me again
Our time go on and on, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Make me your ecstasy
I wanna feel all the ways you breathe
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Make me your ecstasy
I wanna feel all the ways you breathe
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
My heart will rush things hard
You're filling me again
Our time, go on and on, oh-oh-oh-oh
Take me, you're ecstasy, I wanna feel all the ways you breathe
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Make me your ecstasy, I wanna feel all the ways you breathe
Make me your ecstasy, I wanna feel all the ways you breathe
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
