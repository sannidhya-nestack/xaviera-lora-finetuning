Doesn't matter if it's right or wrong
Now don't give a damn, you don't like the song
But your toe keeps tapping a bit too soon
It comes together but something's out of tune
Well, I ain't no cowboy officer to bring me down
A little lazy, maybe I'll look good in a band
You say I'm always on the run
But I'll still be standing here when it's said and done
Your friends parading storm through the place
You're wearing nothing but smiles on the face
We're all adults here tell me what's so wrong
You think I'm having so much fun
But I'm always the first to come
Bother leaving, you're wasting your time
Going nowhere, you're not feeling fine
It doesn't matter,'cause baby the night's still
You think it's over, but it's just begun
And I'll be greetin' the morning sun
When it's settin' down
When it's settin' down
When it's settin' down
Yeah
