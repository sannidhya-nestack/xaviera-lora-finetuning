I'll find a way to let you know
With you I'd like to take it slow
Reach out your hand and I'll give you mine
What's mine is yours
And yours is mine, I know
We'll take it slow
There was a time when love was true
That is the way that I'll love you
I'll give you all if you do the same
If you come back to me
I'll go back to you
Our love is true
Drifting away, inviting our time
We circle around, and then we glide right back
To where we were
We drank from the well, and we talked by the fire
We walked on the beach and stared at the stars
I looked in your eyes and you looked in mine
I fell for you then and you fell for me eventually
I woke up with you here in my arms
We laid for a while and didn't say a word
A new day has dawned and the future is now
We stumble and fall
As we move to where
We now belong
Drifting away
Inviting our time
We circle around
And then we glide right back
To where we were
Drifting away, imbibing our time
We circle around, and then we glide right back
To where we were
