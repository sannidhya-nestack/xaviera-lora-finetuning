Her sire never had the winning touch
As a foal she didn't look like she was gonna be much
But as I brushed her mane I could see in her eyes
She had something inside
Oh, the girl had heart
And even though she got a bad start
When it came time to play her part
Oh, the girl had heart
Her first day at the track, we all could see
She was small and kind of awkward, didn't have much speed
But everyone could tell when her workout was done
She sure loved to run
Oh,'cause the girl had heart
And even though she got a bad start
When it came time to play her part
Oh, the girl had heart
In her very first race
She broke bad from the gate
Down the back stretch the big colts
Pushed her to the outside
But she stayed with'em
You should've seen that filly run
And when they came down to the wire
She won,'cause the girl had heart
And even though she got a bad start
When it came time to play her part
Oh, the girl had heart
Oh, the girl had heart
The girl had heart
The girl had heart
