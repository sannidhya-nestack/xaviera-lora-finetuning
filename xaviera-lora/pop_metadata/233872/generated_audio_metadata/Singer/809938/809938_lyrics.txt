We dance to the beat of a drum that goes on and on and on
I see you feet on the ground come along along along
While we say
And oh I feel this down to my soul it's my song my song my song
The sun and the air and the trees and the breeze I belong belong belong
Uh, hermit crabs on the boardwalk
Uh, grains of sand in my shoes
Uh, eptide in the ocean
Uh, eptide in you
Paradise is twice as nice when you're here with me
Undertow won't let us go so we float out to sea
Listen to the breeze, it holds the keys to the answers we seek
And we watch our fire explode as we go higher like fighters across the stars
Day after day on the bay we will play
Don't procrastinate don't delegate this is your life
While we say we seek the truth look for better lives
Elsewhere my dreams survive
Hope is real and hope is unique
Hope is alive it's hope I seek
Paradise twice as nice when you're here with me
Undertow won't let us go so we float out to sea
Listen to the breeze it holds the keys to the answers we seek
And we watch our fire explode as we go higher like
Sliders across the stars, yeah
Paradise is twice as nice when you're here with me
Undertow won't let us go so we float out to sea
Listen to the breeze, it holds the keys to the answers we seek
And we watch our fire explode as we go higher like fighters across the stars
I want to walk in the water
I want to play in the sand
Feel the sun on my face and the sea in my lungs
I want to walk in the water
My life is unique every day of the week
I want to play in the sand
I can't control but my soul is a hole
I want to walk in the water
Life is unique everyday
I wanna tell you something
Don't think it's time to
I can't control but my soul is a hole
And I think we can make it
Life is unique everyday
We've got nothing to lose
I wanna tell you something
I can't control but my soul is a hole
