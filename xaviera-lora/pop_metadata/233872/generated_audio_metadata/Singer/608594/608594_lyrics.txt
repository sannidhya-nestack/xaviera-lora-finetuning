Who are you to tell me tales of how we're gonna die alone and we will make it on our own
Is there a reason you're complaining
It's not very entertaining
Is there nothing else to do
I never thought that I would say this
But it's easier than run, run
You're not a first
Nor will you ever be the last
Don't let me know
I'm on my own
So you caught me on the run, guess I've never been this fast
But I've built my case to last
Now that everybody knows that I'm a sidekick of the show
I don't need to play pretend anymore
It ain't easy to believe when there is nothing to believe
Got no reason to feel guilty when I'm already ashamed
I play the game
It's hard to be alone
I know it's hard to be alone
Yeah it's hard to be alone
Yeah it's hard to be alone
Everybody's talking fast
I guess I'll always end up last
Always just too late, too late
And I don't know what I'm doing
But I do know who I am
I'm your man that I am
Yes I know
Now I know where you've been
Oh now I know
Yes I know where you've been
