Her name was Sway and she did
She had the usual problems but she knew how to live
Then she met a man, damn men
But the right one followed and she's been good since then
And she ain't dragging things around no more
She's got a real smile on her face for sure
His name was Jesus, different one
Had a business in Topeka, mowing lawns
And he worked so hard for her
He broke his back
But his friend showed up
To pick up the slack
He ain't dragging things around no more
He's got a lot more time with sway for sure
Everybody's bound to hurt sometimes
But it won't last forever and the sun will shine
Stephen and Warren knocked on my door
Selling some religion I'm sure
It was too hard so I quit
Chased him from my porch
With a big ol' stick
I ain't dragging that around no more
I've got better things to do for sure
Than dragging things around
Dragging things around
When things get heavy
Just put'em down
If someone did you dirty
Let it go
Wrap it up and take it to the curb
Nice and slow
Don't be dragging things around
Dragging things around
Don't be dragging, dragging things around
