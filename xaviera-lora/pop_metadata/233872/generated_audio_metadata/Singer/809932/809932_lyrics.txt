Someday the clouds will part and the sun will show
You'll feel better than, oh, oh, oh
And I'll put your mind at ease
And you will know
Sunshine's bright again, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Some of my friends are feeling down
Life is deep and you can drown
Call me up, I'll be around
We'll go out and we can clown
If I could take the pain away
I would do it every day
And we'll see sunshine
Whoa-oh-oh, I love you so
Oh oh oh can you feel it
Oh oh oh I love you so
Oh oh oh I can't conceal it
My love has no desire but to fulfill itself
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh I love you so
Oh oh oh can you feel it
Someday I'll be blue
And I'll need you
I trust you'll see me through, ooh ooh ooh
If you were ever broke
I'd be the glue
I'd connect me to you, ooh ooh ooh
Some of my friends are feeling down
Life is deep and you can drown
Call me up I'll be around
We'll go out and we can clown
If I could take the pain away
I would do it everyday
Then we'll see sunshine
Woah oh oh I love you so
Woah oh oh can you feel it
Woah oh oh I love you so
Woah-oh-oh, I can't conceal it
My love has no desire but to fulfill itself
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woah-oh-oh, I love you so
Woah-oh-oh, can you feel it?
This song goes out to you
So you will know
How much you mean to me
Woah oh oh oh
Our love has sunshine
And it will grow
the end of time I'll say
Woah oh oh oh
Some of my friends are feeling down
Life is deep and you can drown
Call me up I'll be around
We'll go out and we can clown
If I could take the pain away
I would do it every day
Then we'll see sunshine
Woah oh oh I love you so
Woah oh oh can you feel it
Woah oh oh I love you so
Woah-oh-oh, I can't conceal it
My love has no desire but to fulfill itself
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woah-oh-oh, I love you so
Woah-oh-oh, can you feel it?
