The world collides into itself
Catapults the pain
Laughing seems wrong tonight
This overwhelming urge to fall
Remains
You should be sure of me
Of me
And I know, we're scattered in the dark
Fall beside ourselves in fear
And nothing makes sense, it's too bad
These fading birches make you cry
You're sad, but you should be sure of me
Of me
How am I supposed to tell you that all's not lost?
How am I supposed to hold you when you're made of dust?
You should be sure of me
Of me
Of me
Of me, of me, of me
