One, two, three, four, two, two, three, four
What's the point of all this?
Never taste your whole focus at
Know it's just a matter of time before
Fate twists and breaks your spine
Know that I'm given when I'm taken away
My heart's already broken but my love will always stay here
Got news of more pain
Another reparation in vain
Tears fall from a bottomless well
Broken crib, burning in hell
Don't know that I'm given when I am taken away
My heart's already broken but my love will always stay
And God ive me for what I do
But I do it for the love of you
So lay down in the Chevy and smile as the horses go by
Lay down in the Chevy, oh God, you know I tried
And I don't feel sorry for myself
Don't blame anyone else
I know the truth when it's in front of you
I just did what I had to do
You know that I've been given when I've been taken away
My heart's already broken but my love will always stay
And God ive me for what I do
But I do it for the love of you
So lay down in the Chevy and smile as the horses go by
I lay down in the Chevy, oh God, you know I tried
I sat on the wheel, and I looked at my watch
And I looked inside, and I saw her face
And I saw her face
A sorry face
God ive me for what I do
But I do it for the love of you
So lay down in the Chevy and smile as the horses go by
Lay down in the Chevy, oh God, you know I tried
