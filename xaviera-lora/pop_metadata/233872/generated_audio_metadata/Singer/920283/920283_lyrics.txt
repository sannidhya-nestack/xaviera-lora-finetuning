The wind was curious
Why you must be on your way
And it said what is it you got to do today
It's so important you cannot stay
And say hello, hello
Man it's been a long long time
Your mind's been racing, is it happiness you're chasing or is it something else?
Just breathe in, breathe out
Just like the ocean tide
Breathe in, breathe out
What is all this worrying about?
And I've been curious myself
I get reminded when I hear the wind cry
We've been rushing and running and fighting
Some even trying to step on another man
But it could be easy, it could be easy
I get reminded when I hear the wind cry
What life is to live and bout the things that you give
Just tell me can you hear me if you understand
Breathe in, breathe out
Just like the ocean tide
Breathe in, breathe out
What is all this worrying about
Breathe out
Just like the ocean tide
Breathe in, breathe out
What is all this worrying about
In every breath there is a story
You can write it anywhere you feel it's true
And anywhere you go
Hey just remember why you do what you do
And breathe in, breathe out
You're just like the ocean tide
Breathe in, breathe out
What is all this worry?
Breathe in, breathe out
You're just like the ocean tide breathing, breathe out
What is all this worrying about, breathe out
You're just like the ocean tide breathing, breathe out
What is all this worrying about
