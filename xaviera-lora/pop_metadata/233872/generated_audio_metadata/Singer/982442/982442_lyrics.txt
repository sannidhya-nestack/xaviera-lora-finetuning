And I didn't think this would happen again
Then you showed up
I screamed that I was tired of love's little game
Till you made me shut up
Dinosaurs are birds and birds are free
Like dinosaurs with more life
We could be in our own universe
Away from the system, invent our own religion
Divide infinity in two and it's still the same
Only you could understand
Let's create a world without sense
For anyone but ourselves
Just you and me
Or we could be
Watching the sunset on the skies
Building a solar park on Mars
Change the world
It shouldn't hurt
And I just wanna be mad about you
And you could be mad about me
We could be mad together
And we, we could play this through a chord song
Simple isn't always wrong
It doesn't have to be forever
We could turn the world around
Make it spin the other way
Say everything without a word
Just saying our own nonsense
We could be a mess, worry less about forever
Forbid the world never, and feel very clever in a perfect sentence
And I just wanna be mad about you
You could be mad about me
We could be mad together
And we, we can play this two chord song
Cause simple isn't always wrong
It doesn't have to be forever
And I just wanna be crazy with you
You could be crazy with me
We can live our dream and fight against gravity
And they, they don't have to understand
Just come and hold my hand
It's about you and me
And I never thought this would happen again
But then you came around
I'm in love with your madness and style
So this is your song
