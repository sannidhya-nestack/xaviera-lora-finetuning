Good times, clean rhymes and riddles
Be kind, don't lie or fiddle about
Don't shout, we'll tell you what you need to know
Not what you want to hear
Listen to me, I sound just like you
Old ways, long days to Delhi
New toys, old boys
We're carrying on with bells on
Tell us what we need to know
Not what we want to hear
Listen to you
You sound just like me
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Heal your heartbreak, back in the neighborhood, faces we make
Sometimes stay that way for good times
