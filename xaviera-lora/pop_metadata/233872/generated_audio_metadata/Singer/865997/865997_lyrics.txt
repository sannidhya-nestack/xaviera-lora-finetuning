Walking down the sidewalk on a sunny afternoon
Take myself a rain check, I might dream of you
And there's only so much you can keep it locked inside
I might take your heart tonight, keep it by my side
So lay me down
Take a look around you now and tell me how you feel
I've been down that road before so I could make a deal
But it's closer than it's ever been and I'm not turning around
Broken hearts and empty minds are way beyond us now
And I can hear it calling out, so maybe I'll come round
Rain clouds on the way but they're not nearly touching me
Looking at your colours it's the only place I'd be
So lay me down
Take a look around you now and tell me how you feel
And I've been down that road before so I could make a deal
But it's closer than it's ever been and I'm not turning around
So turn me around
I feel the ground
Sometimes it's the way it's going down
Walking up the sidewalk on a rainy afternoon
Take myself a rain check, I might dream of you
There is something sweet in this old life I cannot hide
I won't be alone tonight'cause you'll be on my mind
So lay me down
Take a look around you now and tell me how you feel
And I've been down that road before so I could make that deal
But it's closer than it's ever been and I'm not turning around
But it's closer than it's ever been and i'm not turning around
