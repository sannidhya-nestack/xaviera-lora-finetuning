Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Sometimes it's hard to come enough for air
Swimming'round in the dark, I know you're there
I don't really know where I'm going now
But you always can understand it somehow
You lift me up when I'm falling down
I walk away and you turn me around
I think I like this feeling that I found
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
Some people are so scared to fall
And some people have been through it all
I know that I can be a pain
But then you laugh it off and love me the same
I've been wondering how long I'm gonna keep
Keep you around to make love with me
In love, no doubt, and it's clear to see
Now that I, now that I found you
Now that I've found you
Now that I've found you
Now that I've found you
Oh
Well you lift me up when I'm falling down
I walk away and you turn me around
I think I like this feeling that I found
And there ain't no doubt now that I found you
