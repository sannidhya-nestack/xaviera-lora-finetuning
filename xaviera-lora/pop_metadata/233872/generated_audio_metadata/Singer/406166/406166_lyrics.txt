Out here in the wilderness
Space and time wobble back and forth
We hide from the animals
Cause sometimes they're hungry
And they're searching for food
The end of the world
The end of the world
The end of the world
And we're alone at last
The ocean is drying up
We collect fish bones and shells
We stay up as late as we can
And recite the names of everything
We still remember the ends of the world
The end of the world
The end of the world
And we're alone at last
And the air can get hard to breathe
So we stop and rest a lot
The sky is shimmering
Out here in the wilderness
The sun still glows somewhere in the haze
At night as it gets cold
Then we huddle together and it feels so good
The ends of the world
The end of the world
The end of the world
And we're alone at last
And we're alone at last
And we're alone at last
