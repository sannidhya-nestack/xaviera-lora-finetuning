I would give my life for you
I'd do it every day
I'd fly through the sky for you
To please you every way
I'll be working overtime
Chasing your desires
I would swim the sea for you
You make me so inspired
If I can make you happy, I am complete
I have loved you yesterday
I'll love you tomorrow
I will love you all the time
Through sickness and through sorrow
And when the pain returns to you
Exhale it into my lungs
I won't hesitate for you
Through me you'll see tomorrow
I will volunteer my life for you
Your beauty takes my breath away
It's precious and it's true
I love to gaze inside your soul
I'd bring home the world for you
These words I sing are all for you
Your music in my mind
I long to see your pain subside
And leave it all behind
Hold my hand, I'll be there by your side
