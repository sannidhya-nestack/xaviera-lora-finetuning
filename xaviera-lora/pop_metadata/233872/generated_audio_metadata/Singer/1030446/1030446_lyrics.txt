Snowflakes falling, wind is howling outside
The harbor's freezing, train is leaving, it's a long ride
Through the winter I go, miles to get home, I'm heading back
'Cause you kiss me like summer
I feel the sunshine on my skin
Sweet smell that I'm under
And I'm slowly falling
You kiss me like summer
Kiss me like summer
I didn't know then where this was going
I was so afraid
It was so unexpected from the moment we met
I knew this was fate
I'm counting the days
I can't wait to see you again
'Cause you kiss me like summer
I feel the sunshine on my skin
Sweet spell that I'm under
And I'm slowly falling
You kiss me like summer
Seasons change, the world keeps turning
We'll keep the fire burning
I will always find my way to you
You kiss me like summer, ah
'Cause you kiss me like summer
I feel the sunshine on my skin
Sweet spelling of wonder
And I'm slowly falling
You kiss me like summer
You kiss me like summer
You kiss me like summer
Yeah, you kiss me like summer
