Just when the night was starting to make some sense
Please don't believe that it ever would
Maybe you're living in the past my friend
Don't know if that's bad or good
And if a genie in the lantern would maybe work out alright
Well you turned on your light
And you made everything alright
And the land that lies between the blue skies and the rising tide is a paradise
Well you said it quite nice
Living here in paradise
If you walked around the corner
Give you the smile at number one
Light of a million suns if they shone down
Lucky they would shine on you
And if a genie in the lantern would maybe work out alright
Well you turned on your light
And you made everything alright
And the land that lies between the blue skies and the rising tide is a paradise
Well you said it quite nice
Living here in paradise
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
And the land that lies between the blue skies and the rising tide is a paradise
Well you said it quite nice
And the land that lies between the blue skies and the rising tide is a paradise
Well you said it quite nice
