Two little bars running wild outside
Not a care in the world
Playing with the friends let the fun begin
Fantasies unfurl
A bucket some string and someone to sing
Got a melody in my head
Mama, this is what I wanna be someday
This is what I said
You gotta dream big, aim high
Be yourself and shoot for the sky
You can be anything you wanna be
All you have to do is believe
Take pride in yourself and open each door
Hold your head up high and see what's in store
It's your life to choose no matter what you do
All you need to know is that I'll always love you
Do do do do
Baseball, football, a hockey net
Which sport shall we play
We love them all so
Grab a ball and throw it right this way
The team's made up, we're playing for the cup
Come on and shoot my way
Mama, this is what I wanna be someday
This is what I say
You gotta dream big, aim high
Be yourself and shoot for the sky
You can be anything you wanna be
All you have to do is believe
Take pride in yourself and open each door
Hold your head up high and see what's in store
It's your life to choose no matter what you do
All you need to know is that I'll always love you
Doo-doo-doo-doo
