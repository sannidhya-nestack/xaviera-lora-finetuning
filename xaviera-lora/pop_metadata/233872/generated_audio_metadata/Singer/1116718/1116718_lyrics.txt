Toiling with myself again
The struggle's never through
The blood and sweat, the tears I shed
There's so much work to do
The living's never easy
They're always telling you
The time it takes for heaven's sake
The healing's overdue
You only had to hold me once
You're always misconstrued
You only had to tell me stay
I'd never follow through
Hoc Romani Amoritha
The places we once knew
All those petty memories
They ain't anything to you
I house my thoughts and tie the knots
My handkerchief is clean
The miles and miles behind us
We come from where we've been
I stumble on a memory
Another shot of you
I'm in the night of paradise but don't enjoy the view
You only had to hold me once
You're always misconstrued
You only had to tell me stay
I never follow through
Hoc Romani Amore
Thought the places we once knew
All those petty memories
They ain't anything to you
I shout and scream at everything
But all to no avail
There's nothing there
The cupboards bare
It's gone beyond the pale
So what's the point in suffering?
I might as well go on
It's late to waste cold memory
The carnival has gone
You only had to hold me once
You're always misconstrued
You only had to tell me stay
I'd never follow through
Oh, chroma-D and maritha
The places we once knew
All those petty memories, they added them to you
