Your pulse beats fast, you track the snow
So far to go
One misstep and you could fall
Lose it all
Adrenaline drives the body on
Like an avalanche's will to carry on
No matter how far you climb
Your heart will find its way back home
Snow storms strain your weary eyes
Your soul resists
Every single moment of your life
You've lived for this
Adrenaline drives the body on
Like an avalanche's will to carry on
No matter how far you climb
Your heart will find
The fire inside
It burns stronger when you're all alone
The fire inside
It burns stronger when you're all alone
Your pulse beats fast, you track the snow
Not far to go
Every single moment of your life
You've lived to know
Adrenaline drives the body on
Like an avalanche, it's where you carry on
No matter how far you climb
Your heart will find
It's way back home
