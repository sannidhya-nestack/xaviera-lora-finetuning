It was always gonna be tonight
It was always gonna happen somehow
So go and turn off the light
So the childlike look, it goes away
I'm glad that you've changed your mind
'Cause I've been waiting so long
And it seems as though
Times are changing
And you talk to me like you never
And you're kissing me like that
And we're breaking rules that we've never met
I just wanna get close to you
And just for tonight
And what you say
And just for tonight
It's always gonna be for now
Tomorrow is never a day to come
So let's just leave it for now
We don't have to talk about it
And it seems as though
Lives get stranger, we know that they do
And you talk to me like you never, and you're kissing me like that
And we're breaking rules that we never made
I just wanna get up close to you, babe, oh
And you talk to me like you never, oh
And you're kissing me like that
And we're breaking rules that we've never met
Oh, I just wanna get close to you
Mmm, just for tonight
