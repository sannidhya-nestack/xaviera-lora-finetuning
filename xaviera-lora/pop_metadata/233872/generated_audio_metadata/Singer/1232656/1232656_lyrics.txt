Falling, wasn't part of the plan
I'm all in, but I still don't understand that feeling
When I look at you
The world around us disappears and all I see is you
I'm flying for you so high
And now I'm loving this new view
Our hearts are painting the sun kissed sky
A new horizon with you
Falling, feels like flying, it's true, I'm wanting
Just to dive into you, that feeling
Wanna slow down the time
Remember every moment when I closed my eyes
I knew I'm flying for you, so high
And now I'm loving this new view
Our hearts are painting the sun kissed sky
Am I only dreaming or did this dream come true
Say you feel the same way and want the same things too
Oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, I'm flying for you so high
And now I'm loving this new view
Our hearts are playing the circus, got a new horizon view
Oh, I'm flying for you so high
And now I'm loving this new view
Our hearts are beating in the sun-kissed sky
The new horizon with you
Oh, I'm flying for you, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (So high, now I know my love is moving)
Thoughts of pain in the sun can't scatter, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm flying for you, so high, now I know my love is moving
