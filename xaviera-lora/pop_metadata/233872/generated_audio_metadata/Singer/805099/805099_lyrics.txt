I thought of you, I thought of you, I thought of
I thought of you when I heard our song
I was reminded of all I did wrong
If I ever saw you again
I would say I'm sorry then
I would let you know that I'm a better man
And that time is a healer if I saw you again
You saw the end, I felt the pain
You wanted more, I wanted the same
If I ever saw you again
I would say no one's to blame
For wanting something else
We just can't always help
What we need if I saw you again
I didn't know who I could be
Until the day you set me free
If I ever saw you again
I would see you as a friend
Who has given me my life
Though you cut me like a knife
This is now and that was then
I would thank you if I saw you again
If I ever
Saw you again
