The bell it sounds in the 8th round
It's a clean strike but it feels more like the wave of a fire alarm
The champ had thrown every last blow at this kid who'd trained in the wind and the rain
And believed his heart was a charm
Through his half shut eyes with the crowd and the cries
And the hovering doctor with the ref by his side he said
Kid have you had enough
As he sat in his stool with the worn away blue
His thoughts brought him back to his time on the track he said
Ref I'm saving my stuff
But the heart may not
That I may not help you at all
That I may not
The heart cannot help if you fall
So the ninth round starts and his head plays the part
But the calls from the corner move your feet
Try to counter never reach his weakening ears
Three months straight fifteen hours every day
And his steel toe kicks on route fifty-six is my
Rejected affair
So the champ comes forth like a bull with a sword and his fist full of fury
ot about a jury, it's time to finish him off
All the time at the back but the kid's some sag
And the underwater feeling as he found himself kneeling
And he knew what wasn't enough
'Cause the heart may not help
The heart may not help you at all
The heart may not help
The heart cannot help if you fall
Far away
You're floating downstream
No, this wasn't just a dream, yeah
How may I help you at all?
How may I help?
How can I help if you fall?
How may I help?
The heart may not help you at all
The heart may not help
The heart cannot help if you fall
But the heart may not help
The heart may not help you at all
The heart may not help
How can I help if you fall
