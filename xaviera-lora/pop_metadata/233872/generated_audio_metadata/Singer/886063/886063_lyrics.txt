You say that I have all the power
But you know that isn't true
it would only take a few words
To bring me back to you
And I've always had a restless heart
Always scared to get tied down
But it would only take a few words
To make me come around
You know I'd come if you called me
You know I'd come back home
Treasure buried in the water
Treasure buried in the sea, in the sea
And I wish you'd call me
I wish you'd call me
I wish you'd call me
