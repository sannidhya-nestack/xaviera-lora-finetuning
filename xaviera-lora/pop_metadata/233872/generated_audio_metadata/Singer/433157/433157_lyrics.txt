Spinning round on the floor, someone held me to my knees
You didn't mean to bring me down, but what you're playing ain't what I need
Ain't what I need, no
What to say and what to do
Always seemed to slip my mind
But I've been around enough to know
That what you're doing is so unkind
The way you hold me down
Hold me down
Always trying to get the best of me, yeah
Hold me down
Hold me down
Hoping that I'm never breaking free
From these chains, oh yeah, won't you let go, baby
Much too scared to go outside
Someone's bound to see my sins
So I'll keep inside these four walls
Think of ways to let you in
Yeah, I'm gonna let you in
So you can hold the devil
Hold the devil
Always trying to get the best of me, yeah
Holding me down, holding me down
Hoping that I'll never break and fail, I promise you
'Cause you gotta break, break away from this chain
you gotta break, break away from this chain, oh
I'm on this chain
I'm spinning round on the floor
Someone held me to my knees
Didn't mean to bring you down
But what you're paying ain't what I need
