Ooh, ooh, ooh
One of my times
Can't seem to remember
Those pretty lies
I couldn't make
Still like to go back one day
Gotta keep the walls up
You know here inside
It's like yesterday
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Frighteners of my heart
Frighteners of my heart
(Find myself) (Find myself)
Must be that time of year again
There's snow outside
As I breathe
Oh, just my decline
Feels rational
I'm looking so old
Just fragments of mine
What I used to be
Fragments of mine
Fragments of my, fragments of my, fragments of my, fragments of my
Fragments of my, fragments of my life
I want to be with you, I want to be with you, I want to be with you
