A silver thread is broken
So much left undone
So much left unspoken
Longing clinging
Finally letting go to find
The song itself is singing
Now I hear your music in the skies
Your laughter in the leaves
Your whisper in the wind
I feel your arms enfold me
When the sunlight warms my skin
When all that's less than love has died away
You'll find your place among the stars
And you will shine through night and day
Shine through space and time
Shine
When all that's less than love has died away
You'll find your place among the stars
And you will shine through night and day
Shine through space and time
Shine
