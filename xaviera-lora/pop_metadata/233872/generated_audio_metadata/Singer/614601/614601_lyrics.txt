Well I remember well it all began so wonderful
We went out together couldn't be better
For she felt it too
The sun came up and seemed to shine forevermore
Lit up your daytime warm up your nighttime
And life was good
But one day you wake up to find your love has gone
And you're all alone trying hard to let her go
I know it's so damn hard to get some truth out there
To get through the sorrows there's always tomorrow
Waiting for you there
I know just how you feel for arriving there before
Lose the love, it ain't there no more
I know it's so damn hard to get some truth out there
There's always tomorrow, always tomorrow waiting for you
There's always tomorrow, always tomorrow waiting for you
There's always tomorrow waiting for you
There's always tomorrow waiting for you
