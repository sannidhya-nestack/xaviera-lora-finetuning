One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-one, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-one, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-one, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-two, twenty-two, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-one
I've been hard and fierce
Possessive minds in possessive times
Been wasted all these years
Yeah yeah yeah
It's not the same
Yeah something's changed
I know it's changed
You look at me to blame
Yeah yeah yeah
And outside it's grey
The rain appears
It's coming down like these tears
Oh I know what comes around comes and goes
Oh I know they're telling me tonight
Oh, I know what comes around comes and goes
Oh, I know they're telling me to not, not come home
My so called friends
Like to get me down
Now they got me down
It's taking me to the end
Yeah yeah yeah
You walk away
They're telling me
So what they say
And is this my mistake
Yeah yeah yeah
Not turn around
Dying made to leave here
Finding it hard to breathe
Oh, I know what comes around, comes and goes
Oh, I know they're telling me tonight
Oh, I know what comes around, comes and goes
Oh, I know they're telling me tonight
I turn around, I'm made to leave here
Finding it hard to believe
Oh I know what comes around, comes and goes
Oh I know they're telling me tonight
Oh I know what comes around comes and goes
Oh I know they're telling me tonight oh no
