You're my friend and I lean on you when times are dire
I lean on you'cause you I admire, oh yeah
Sunshine through the clouds, oh we can go higher
We're just two birds on a wire
We used to be strangers long ago
Now we are friends, you and me
All these years I've looked around the world you see
Ain't no one like you, I guarantee
And every time I think of me all alone
I'm so glad we are friends, you and me
And as time goes by, we will live our lives
But we'll always be friends, you and me
But if I'm down I can call you'll be there for me
Show my eyes when I can't see
I call you Kimo Sabe
You sit and listen when I'm drowning in fire
Make a joke when I desire
My personal Richard Fryer
We used to be strangers long ago
Now we are friends, you and me
All these years I've looked around the world you see
Ain't no one like you I guarantee
And every time I think of me all alone
I'm so glad we are friends you and me
And as time goes by we will live our lives
But we'll always be friends you and me
You're my friend and I lean on you when times are dire
I lean on you'cause you are in my air, oh yeah
Sunshine through the clouds, oh, we can go higher
We're just two birds on a wire
We used to be strangers long ago
Now we are friends, you and me
All these years I've looked around the world you see
Ain't no one like you I guarantee
And every time I think of me all alone
I'm so glad we are friends you and me
And as time goes by we will live our lives
But we'll always be friends you and me
