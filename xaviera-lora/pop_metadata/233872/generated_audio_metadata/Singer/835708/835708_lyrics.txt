Would you hold your umbrella in the rain for me
Would you show me good old fashioned chivalry
I might get swept up just like an ingenue
But could I, should I with you
If I kept you waiting there'til half past eight
Would you smile and tell me still that I look great?
A guy like that could make me come unglued
But could I, should I with you?
Night falls, you're on my mind as expected
My thoughts spin counterclockwise
Back to the time you first caught my eye
Are you strong enough to always do what's right?
Make me feel secure and let the small things slide
A guy like that might be a wise pursuit
But could I, should I with you?
Night falls, you're on my mind as expected
My thoughts spin counterclockwise
Back to the time you first caught my eye
Would you hold your umbrella in the rain for me?
Would you show me good old fashioned chivalry?
I might get swept up just like an andanute
But could I, should I with you?
Could I, should I with you?
Could I, should I with you?
