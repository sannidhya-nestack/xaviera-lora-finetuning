Jonathan Marsh was buried yesterday
He was laid to rest in a pine box in an unmarked grave
He was only 41 years old when the good Lord took him from this world
Pray for the soul of Jonathan Marsh
He died last week with twelve cents in his pocket
They blamed it on his heart, they said he lost it
He fell in love with booze and drugs
And we all know that's not enough, Ray
For the soul of Jonathan Marsh
They shipped him like a parcel to Chicago
That's not the way a man's supposed to go back home
Despite his sister's cheerful plea
She had to claim him COD prey
For the soul of Jonathan Marsh
They say he was a renaissance philosopher
A brightness untapped and undiscovered
He traded the American dream
For an empty bench on a city street
Pray for the soul of Jonathan Marsh
On his deathbed his abandoned son was witness
Do the only thing we own worth taking with us
He turned his eyes up to the sky and whispered, "I'm not afraid to die"
Pray for the soul of Jonathan Marsh
With his last breath his dying wish was spoken
His spirit and his promise never broken
He gave the world his heart and hand
Through his eyes the blind will see again
Pray for the soul of Jonathan Marsh
Jonathan Marsh was buried yesterday
