I just go against the flow, that's what I do
I don't care what others say, I follow my own truth
Yes I, I don't wanna change
Cause I, I make my own way
And sometimes that makes it hard
The words cut me like a knife
But they can't get their head around
I'm living my own life
Cause I, I don't wanna change
Yeah I, I make my own way
Everybody keeps on telling me
I should be someone else
No one understands but you know I can only be myself
And you might say I'm arrogant, and I might be so
But when I rest my head at night, there's one thing I know
That I will never change,'cause I go my own way
Everybody keeps on telling me I should be someone else (be someone else)
And nobody understands but you know I can only be myself
People talking, I can hear them talking
Gotta be in with the crowd
I'm laughing, yeah, I'm just laughing out loud
Everybody keeps on telling me I should be someone else
No one understands but you know I can only be myself
Everybody keeps on telling me I should be someone else
No one understands but you know I can only be myself
Everybody keeps on telling me
I should be someone else
No one understands but you know I can only be myself
