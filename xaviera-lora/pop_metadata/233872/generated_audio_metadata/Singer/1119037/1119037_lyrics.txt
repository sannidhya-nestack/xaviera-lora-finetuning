Today it's summer in New York City
It's a little bit of sad and a lot of bit of pretty
Will you touch me? I dare you
We're sitting at the park and we're staring at the water
It's a little bit of lonely and a lot of bit together
Will you touch me? Even if I scare you
If you love me from Brooklyn to Queens
I'll love you to the statue of liberty
Take me somewhere I wanna be
And I'll never wanna leave
Even though I can't trust anybody
I'm still rising like the empire, honey
All night long I think I'm living in a dream
Today it's summer in New York City
I'm a little bit angry and a lot of "won't you hold me, it's stormy"
Darling, shield me from the rain
I'm mad at all my friends and I don't fit with my family
I need you here, I need you to get me
Can you do that for me?
Press me against your skin (press me against your skin)
If you love me from Brooklyn to Queens I'll love you to the Statue of Liberty
Take me somewhere I wanna be and I'll never wanna leave (never wanna leave)
Even though I can't trust anybody I'm still rising like the Empire
Honey, on my mind think I'm living in a dream
I think I'm living in a dream
Stay here, I never wanna leave
I think I'm living in a dream
Stay here, I never wanna leave
I think I'm living in a dream
Stay here, I never wanna leave
I think I'm living in a dream
Stay here, I never wanna leave
If you love me from Brooklyn to Queens
I'll love you to the statue of liberty
Take me somewhere I wanna be and I'm
Your hope on a leaf
Even though I can't trust anybody
I'm still rising like the empire honey
All night long I think I'm living in a dream
Dream dream
I say all night long I think I'm living in a dream
Dream dream
All night long I think I'm living in a dream
