Great times and a moonlight night for us
You're my best friend and I can't imagine me without you
I was lost until I found you, just wanna be around you
Now I know that I found you
You say it's alright
And you hold my hand as we go
It doesn't matter who you are or what you look like
You make me better just trying to keep me upright
The love you give shines as bright as daylight
Biggest thing there is
It's like honey to a bee
You've got the most beautiful teeth
Don't you know that my chakra's at peace
I'm in love with the feeling you bring
And you know I love you so
We may live in the dirt, at least we look at the stars
It's a place for us between Venus and Mars
And we belong together
And as seconds go by I can't deny
Those beautiful eyes when you look at me
And I want you forever
It doesn't matter who you are or what you look like
You make me better just trying to keep me upright
The love you give shines as bright as daylight
Biggest thing there is
Is like honey to a bee
You've got the most beautiful teeth
Don't you know my chakra's at peace
I'm in love with the feeling you bring
It's like honey to a bee
You've got the most beautiful cheek
Launching all of our chakras at peace
I'm in love with the feel in your breathe
And you know I love you so
