Working man, working woman
Wages squeezed, where's your wingman?
Weatherman on the news
Do your job, sing the blues
Zimmerman told it all
Did we listen? Did we fall?
Congressman, Congresswoman, where's your honor?
What's your reason?
Quiet lives of desperation
Willings made without sensation
Heroic acts to feed our kids
Bustin' chops just to live
Oh night watchman, what you've seen
On your watch, so obscene
Country man, country woman
Set your plan, set your reason
Every man, every woman
Now's the time, now's the season
Quiet lives of desperation
Willings made without sensation
Heroic acts to feed our kids
Busting chops just to live
Fireman, fire lady, earth on fire, hot as Haiti
Fireman, fire lady, earth on fire, hot as Haiti
Quiet lives of desperation
Willings made without sensation
Heroic acts to feed our kids
Busting chops just to live
Just to live
Just to live
