The moon's holding water
The snake sheds its skin
Someone wonders where the hell he's been
He's walking down the railroad track
Carrying something in his hand
There goes another bright young man
Ooh, ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh
You gotta catch'em while you can
Ooh, ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh
There goes another bright young man
The devil's in the town square
With nothing but time
And a way to help him
Identify with his own kind
Smoking music seeping out
Of a black conversion van
There goes another bright young man
You gotta catch him while you can
There goes another bright young man
The sound of the earth
The blade of the plow
Grind in the dirt
To nourish the cell
What's put in your bowl?
When it's your turn
The water never boils long
Beneath the bridges that get burned
Burned, yeah, yeah, yeah
He came home in the morning, no explanation why
With a wet brown paper bag and a cut over his eye
Momma's head's under the covers, daddy's washing his hands
There goes another bright young man
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You gotta catch him while you can, can
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There goes another bright young man
There goes another
There goes another bright young man
There goes another
