I used to care but times have changed
I used to worry'bout playing the game
These empty bars and these endless miles won't harm me
Nowhere is home to me
Your heart and your soul is home to me
Living on the road's gonna keep you free
Keep your needs few and you will see
That the measure of success is born of relativity
They all ask me what you're trying to achieve
Nowhere is home to me
And I've got faith and I've got time
I've got a woman who rests on my mind
She'll give my life a certain kind of positivity
Oh yes indeed
And I don't believe in God but he believes in me
Nowhere is home to me
Your heart and your soul is home to me
