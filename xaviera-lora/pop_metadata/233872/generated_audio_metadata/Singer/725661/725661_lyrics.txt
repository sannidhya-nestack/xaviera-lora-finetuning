Here we are, take two, hoping this time will change
Doesn't matter that we've been here before
Each time it feels strange
My eyes can't hold back the light
I see so much, I'm blind
My thoughts can't work this one through
There's a hole in my mind
My skin is cold, your hands are warm
Please don't let me go
My legs can't move, I cannot fight
Please let me stay
Words die on the tip of my tongue, dried up in fear
Every second that you're looking at me, passes by and I hear
This dance I thought I knew, these steps were mine
My feet have lost their way
I can't recover in time
My skin is cold
Your hands are warm
Please don't let me go
My legs can't move
I cannot fight tonight
Please let me stay
Clouds part, the rains lift
Seems I've caught the thread
The past lies behind us now
It's time to ive, you said
My skin is cold, your hands are warm
Please don't let me go
My legs can't move, I cannot fight
Tonight, please let me stay
My skin is cold, your hands are warm
Please don't let me go
