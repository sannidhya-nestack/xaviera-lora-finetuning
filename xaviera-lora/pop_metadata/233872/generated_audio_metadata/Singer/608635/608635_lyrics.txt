I've counted days'til your return
I've shed a tear for every tear you burned
I've waited long and I've grown strong
I've learned et what was really wrong
And so are you happier
Now that you've seen the world
This life taught you anything
I used to burn it in a fast
I'd burn it in a fast
Summertime is in my mind
Another year has easily flown by
And remember what I heard you say
Winds aren't blowing my way anymore
So are you happier now that you've seen the world?
Has life taught you anything?
Are you still burning it fast?
Are you burning it fast?
I know why, yeah, why, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Sorry that I'd be here now that you've seen the world
Unless I taught you anything
So are you happier now that you've seen the world?
Has life taught you anything?
Are you still burning it too fast?
