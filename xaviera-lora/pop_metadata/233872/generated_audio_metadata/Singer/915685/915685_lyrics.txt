Leaving the road, leaving the lights
I find myself wandering
I wanna wear out these hiking shoes
And sit in the campfire's glow
Leaving the noise deep into night
As stars spark up the sky
Through pathways of primer greens and blues
In the bones of above and below
The flare of a flame
As it snaps and sparks
With eyes half closed
It will draw me to dream
Of the seeds that might sprout
From my heart's fertile ground
In the dark and bright
In between
Lost in my thoughts, lost in my life
I find myself wondering
How I might wear out these worn out ways
And breathe in the clear mountain air
Beyond the path deepened and dark
The moon rides through the trees
Between all I've lost and all I love
Is the light on the lake and a prayer
The flare of a flame
As it snaps at sparks
With eyes half closed
It will draw me to dreams
Of the seeds that might sprout from a heart's fertile ground
In the dark and bright in between
I want to walk with the spirits of earth and sky
Breathing the scent of wood smoke taking in the peace nearby
The flare of a flame as it snaps and sparks
With eyes half closed it will draw me to dream
Of the seeds that might sprout from the heart's fertile ground
In the dark and bright
In between
In between
