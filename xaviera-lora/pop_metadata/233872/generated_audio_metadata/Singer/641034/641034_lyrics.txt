Sat down with myself this morning
Had a little heart to heart
I've been down this road before
But I don't even know where to start
The world keeps turning and I'm still learning
You have to live with your mistakes
My heartbeat burning so deep in my soul
I wanna take a leap of faith
I know this time I can change
If only I can find the strength
Sat down with myself this morning
The world keeps turning and I'm still learning
You have to live with your mistakes
My heartbeat burns so deep in my soul
I wanna take a leap of faith
Have you ever felt like you're running out of places to hide?
And everything around you is moving at the speed of light
But you're stuck, in a rut, alone in the dark
Yet you know in your heart you have to take charge
Cause there ain't nothing you've ever done in your life that's so bad
You can't be iven
There's always a chance
To make things right
World keeps turning
World keeps turning
Turning, turning, turning, turning
