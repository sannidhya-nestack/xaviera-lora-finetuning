Changing colors in my mind
Forever mild seems right
I've caught your eyes, casting over mine
Shiver down my spine, thrills me fine
What it is to know, reflected in your mind
So I know I'm alright
You stand by my side
Changing colours in our time
Ticking clocks can't stop
Zales, shivering my dear
Hours can't leave us without fear
What it is to know is reflected in your mind
Everywhere we go people stop and stare
I know I'm alright
You stand by my side
You, how you make me feel
You, how you make me feel
What it is to know
It's reflected in your mind
I know I'm alright
If you'll stand by my side
I'll be alright
I'll be alright
I'll be alright
I'll be alright
