Walk with me through the dead wood trees
Through the smoke and the wicked fold that make your ill at ease
If you just breathe then you won't believe
World knew how to walk with me
Well nobody wants to spend their time alone
Rattle around in an empty home
You sleep and you cry and you sigh and moan
On and on and on it goes
Now I don't profess to have it figured out
It's unintentional without a doubt
Now if you feel like you're on your knees
And you know that you want a release
Walk with me
Walk with me through the deadwood trees
Through the smoke and the wake before
To make your ill-lightings
If you just breathe then you won't be leaving
Oh no, but to walk with me
Now I can't show you what you should find
It would be wrong for me to try
But I can help you get there
The secret is calm and I see you're serene
If you just breathe
Walk with me through the deadwood trees
Through the smoke and the wicked folk to meet you
Ill-lighted, if you just breathe
Then you won't believe
Oh no
Got to walk with me
Got to walk with me
