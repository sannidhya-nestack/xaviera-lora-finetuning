You go your way
You go your way
I think I'll stay
I think I'll stay
But you go your way
When blue
When blue lights your day
When blue lights your day
I, oh I will stay
I, oh I will stay
And you
Go your way.
You go your way
When blue lights your day
Ah, yes I will stay
I, oh I will stay
And you, go your way
Yes you, go your way
