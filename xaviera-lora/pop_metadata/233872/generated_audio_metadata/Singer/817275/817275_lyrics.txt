There was a time when I was crazy, crazy in love with you
There was a time you were my sweet dream, sweet dream that never came true
Now the days are sad and lonely
Filled with nothing but regret
I think about your smile only
And the first time our eyes met
There was a time I should have told you
Told you how I really feel
There was a time your soft voice moved me
Moved me to love you for real
Now I let my chance go by
Living with this big mistake
To see you with that other guy
My heart can't help but break
There was a time when I was lazy
Lazy and selfish too
There was a time I played this big fool
A fool for losing you
Now the nights are lost and lonely
With the ghosts of deep despair
My past still haunts me only
When I wake up you're never there
There was a time when I was crazy
Crazy in love with you
Crazy in love with you
Oh crazy in love with you
Crazy in love with you
