I feel alive and renewed
Been waiting so long just to get in the mood
I've been waiting for days such
Don't count the ways just to do what I do
I gotta make it through
Can't wait another night just to live and let loose
I feel like it's finally time
Been waiting all my life now I'mma be with you
Yeah yeah yeah oh yeah
I'm alive, I can't deny
That with you by my side
I'm the top of the world
Feels like I'm high with you on site
I just keep getting higher
Higher
I can't hide, hide, I, I, I, I, I, I
I can't hide, hide, I, I ,I, I, I, I
I was lost and confused
Didn't know what to do
Before I met you
I, I was so immature
Now I know it for sure
I'm growing with you
That's why
Feel like it's finally time
Been waiting all my life
Now I'mma be with you
Yeah yeah yeah
I am alive, I can't deny
I'm with you by my side
On the top of the world
I
High, I, I, I, I, I, I
I did high, high, I, I, I, I, I
