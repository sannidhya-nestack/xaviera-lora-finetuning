Don't wander or go under
I'll see you through
It seems your clouds will still appear on sunny days
In other ways it rains for you, yes it does
But sunshine doesn't guarantee to satisfy
It magnifies existent blues
So don't wander or go under
I'll see you through
Skies darken, blues hearken
I'll be there for you
You find the better days are few and far between
Of feeling fine and full of life, oh-huh
But freedom doesn't guarantee another day
Just another way, another fight
Don't wander or go under
I'll see you through
Skies darken, dogs barking
I'll be there for you
Why can't we understand what a heart can feel?
When will we realize what our eyes reveal?
How can we get it right? We're up all night again
Where do we take this pain it can't sustain
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah, uh, ah, ah
Don't wonder, I'll see you through
