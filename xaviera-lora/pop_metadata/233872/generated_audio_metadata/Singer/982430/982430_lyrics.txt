Alice is in love with the Mad Hatter, do you know?
The Red Queen got the news yesterday
And now they're running far away
Alice is in love with the Mad Hatter, you know?
They're from two worlds and absolutely mad
But being crazy isn't always bad
They're one step away from reality
They know how to count down infinity
They're the craziest couple in history
And they know
How to build up a castle with their dreams
How to move down the walls and be free
They rely on each other completely
They're in love
So let them be just as crazy as they should be
Just as mad as we all are when we are in love
Can't you see nothing can stop their victory?
The war is over mad love beats hate and logic
Who needs logic?
Hell is this in love with a mad hatter do you know?
They brought warmth into a cold world
Changed it all with a single word
Alice is in love with the mad hatcher that you know
They build up their own universe
Between a chorus and the verse
You need
Verse do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Uni
Verse do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
They never draw a straight line
They write the best poems without a rhyme
Here in infinity with limited time and they know
But they don't have a thing to fear
They're far away but right here
They make sadness disappear with their love
So let them be just as crazy as they should be
Just as mad as we all are when we are in love
Can't you see? Nothing can stop their victory
The war is over, mad love beats hate and logic
Who needs logic?
Alice is in love with the mad hatter that you know
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Alice is in love with the mad hatter that you know
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
