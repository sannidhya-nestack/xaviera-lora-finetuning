When I knew little purpose, you became the only one
And when there was rain, you stayed the only one
Bringing some light, giving me strength
Through all the storms, you've been the only one
And I know there'll never be another one
Letting you in, you're holding my heart
So scared to death, I can only hold my breath
You came in through places that I had long since sealed
Through the years and too many tears
Only you from a million faces
Only you from a million faces
When I knew little purpose you became the only one
And when there was rain you stayed the only one
Bringing some light giving me strength
Through all the storms you've been the only one
And I know there will never be another one
Try to resist your pull
Don't know why I had to say goodbye
But never felt so empty
Always felt so lost
You keep walking around in my mind
Of a million people you seem to know only me
Of a million people I only know you
When I knew little purpose you became the only one
And when there was rain you stayed the only one
Bringing some light giving me strength
Through all the storms you've been the only one
And I know there will never be another one
You hold the code to my heart
Even when my head keeps us apart
But over and over I still feel the pain
I refuse to think anymore
But my love doesn't want to go
But doesn't know where to start
Doesn't know where to start
Doesn't know where to start
When I knew little purpose you became the only one
And when there was rain you stayed the only one
Bringing some light giving me strength
Through all the storms you've been the only one
And I know there'll never be another one
There'll never be another one
Through all the storms, you've been the only one
And I know there'll never be another one
