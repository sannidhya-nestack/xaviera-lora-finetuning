Run through the fields, run through the sands
Run through the woods of distant lands
Run with the dreams of a little child
And take with you this deep breath of mine
Run to the east, run to the west
Run with the heartbeat inside my chest
Run for the hope of a brand new day
Run for the blood inside my veins
Run, old steam train
Run for us
Like there's no other way
Keep running for us
Like we don't live in vain
And run for me
My old steam train
Run for the voices that nobody heard
Take away all these things strange and absurd
Run through the mountains and over the rivers
Take with you our letters and then bring us shivers
Run for the hope
Of a brand new day
Your fuel is the blood
Running in our veins
Run to the end
To a place I'll never see
And when you reach the ocean
Say a prayer for me
Run
Or a steam train
Run for us like there's no other way
Keep running for us like we don't live in vain
Run for me my old sting train
Run for the hope of a brand new day
Your fuel is the blood running in my veins
Run to the end, to a place I'll never see
And when you reach the ocean
Say a prayer for me
Run, all steam train
Run for us, like there's no other way
Keep running for us, like we never lived in vain
And run from me, my old steam train
