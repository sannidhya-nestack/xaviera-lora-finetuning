Snowflakes as big as butterfly wings
Falling forever it seems
The sun comes out
And melts the ice
Then it starts to snow again
Everybody sees
Spring is just around the corner
The corner of your only mind
Spring is just around the corner
And it won't be a long time
Teardrops as big as falling raindrops
Running down the cheeks of wine, oh
Doesn't everybody cry
Spring is just around the corner
The corner of your only mind
Spring is just around the corner
And it won't be a long time
Don't be alone, don't be alone, don't be alone, don’t be alone, don't be alone
Long time (a long long time)
Don't be alone (don't be alone)
Don't be alone (don't be alone)
Long time (a long long time)
Don't be alone (don't be alone)
Don't be alone (don't be alone)
Long time
Spring is just around the corner
The corner of your only mind (the corner of your mind)
Spring is just around the corner (spring is just around the corner)
And it won't be alone (it won't be alone)
It won't be a long time, long long time
