There's an eyelash on your face I don't wanna fix
It reminds me of the place I fell in love with you
And the one thing left to change
Is the lighting in the sky when you smile
What you mean to me, the world to see
What she sees in me, everything else falls apart at the seam
what you mean to me is everything, oh
There's a picture of the bay that I meant to frame
It reminds me of the days we had everything
And the one thing left to say
You're the apple of my scar when you smile
What you mean to me, need the world to see
What she sees in me, everything else falls upon a thought seam
Cause what you mean to me is everything, oh oh oh oh oh oh
What you mean to me, need to want to see
What she sees in me, everything else falls apart at the seam
Cause what you mean to me is everything
