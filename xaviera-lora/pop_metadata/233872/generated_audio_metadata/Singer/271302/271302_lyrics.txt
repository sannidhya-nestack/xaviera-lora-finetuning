In your sky I'm reeling
Falling for you
Lost life calling
Sailing into the blue
Promise is broken
Remind me of when
The seagulls were crying
For now I'm on my own again
Carry me on the seagull's wing
So I can face into the wind
And I will know the reasons why
When I'm alone the seagulls cry
Sails unfurling
White as the clouds
Lead me back to
Knowing that I love you now
Carry me on the seagull's wing
So I can face into the wind
And I will know the reasons why
When I'm alone the seagulls cry
Carry me on the seagull's wing
So I can face into the wind
And I will know the reasons why
When I'm alone, the seagulls cry
Carry me on the seagull's wing
So I can face into the wind
I will know the reasons why
When I'm alone
The seagulls cry
