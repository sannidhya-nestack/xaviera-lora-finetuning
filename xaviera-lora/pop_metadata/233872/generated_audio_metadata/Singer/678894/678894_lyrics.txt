I never thought it would end this way
With a dagger in my hand
Can't see the blood, but I feel the pain
And I'm trying to understand
And if you're sending me a message
It's getting harder to ignore
But when I find the deeper meaning
I won't be hurting anymore
Send up a prayer to a God unknown
Help me understand your ways
Here in the world of flesh and bone
I'm feeling fragile and afraid
But if you're sending me a message
It's getting harder to ignore
And when I find a deeper meaning
I won't be hurting anymore
I've grown accustomed every day
To reaching out for things I used to know
I gotta let go
And if you're sending me a message
It's getting harder to ignore
But when I find the deeper leaving
I won't be hurting anymore
I won't be hurting anymore
I won't be hurting anymore
