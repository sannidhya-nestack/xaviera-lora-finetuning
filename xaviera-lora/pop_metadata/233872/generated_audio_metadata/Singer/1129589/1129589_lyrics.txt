We were leather gloves molded to each other
No rough edges perfect lovers moving in sync
We woke up one day calling miles apart
Tiny fractures crisscross our hearts
Silence grows like weeds
Pretend that we don't see
we don't wanna believe
We're puzzle pieces that don't fit
Left us lost and wondering what happened
What happened?
Now we're down here on our knees
As we search through all of these puzzle pieces
Looking for reasons
We're missing puzzle pieces
Why did we end up on different sides?
I wanna reach across this no fault line
How long can we keep trying?
You always keep a part of me, but we just can't be
Puzzle pieces that don't fit
Left us lost and wondering what happened
What happened
Now we're down here on our knees
As we search through all of these puzzle pieces
Looking for reasons
We're missing puzzle pieces
Now we're down here on our knees
As we search through all of these puzzle pieces
Looking for reasons
We're missing puzzle pieces
