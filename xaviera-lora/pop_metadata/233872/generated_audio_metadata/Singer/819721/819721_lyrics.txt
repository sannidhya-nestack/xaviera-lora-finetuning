I might have felt an earthquake when I met you
I might have felt the world shake when I let you
Kiss me under the moonlight
Kiss me under the moonlight
I might have felt a hurricane when I saw you
I might have felt a little drop of rain when I let you
Hold my hand against your heart and tell me that you love me
Storms might come to pass but I could get used to this with you
And the seas might hurt us around and around this empty shell but
I will always stick with you
I'll always stick with you
Did you feel a little earthquake when you met me
A little world shake when I let you hold me so close
Kiss my lips feel a little rainfall
Feel a little hurricane when I let you into my heart
Let you into my heart
Now
There will be storms in this life
That will shake us to our core and make us
Fear our very best could wind up hurting us again
And there will be earthquakes and hurricanes
Lightning and thunder
But I will not let you go
I won't let you go
No
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
