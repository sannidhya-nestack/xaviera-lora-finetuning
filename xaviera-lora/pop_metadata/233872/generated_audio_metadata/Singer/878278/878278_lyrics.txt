What you say shall come to pass
It's such a beautiful day
Think I'll blow off a world and do more important things
Maybe I'll fly away
I could get so much higher if you'd get off my wings
And we could go for a ride
And go somewhere no one's ever been before
A place you can't be denied
You don't have to hide
Behind your new cosmetic metaphors
Just doesn't do it for me
I don't wanna be fashionably delicious
I don't wanna be
Just like everyone else on the list
I love your clothes and your hair
They go so well with the times and all the magazines
Hope you don't mind if I stare
I like to waste my time on the trivial things
Who you trying to be?
You work so hard at being something you're not
Don't make no sense to me how you're begging your plea
And you're never satisfied with what you got
And now that what you got just doesn't do it for me
I don't wanna be fashionably delicious
I don't wanna be
Just like everyone else on the list
Just think what I might have missed
What you say, if you believe in what you say, don't come to me
Politics add up the worst, pure of style, it's not mine, style
I'm from a place where it's the clothes that's how the people go
You know, very one-handed ones, man, I don't care about the colors or stuff you don't want
We're gonna overturn this, wait to wear
What's cool now, what's in today
Tell me I'll be sure to do the opposite
And what I'm trying to say
I don't think this suit and tie will ever fit
And I'm a terrible mess
Always knocking down doors and keeping this in mind
Don't wanna be like the rest, I attest to the best
A part of the herd, always standing in line
Standing in line doesn't do it for me
I don't wanna be fashionably delicious
I don't wanna be
Just like everyone else on the list
I don't wanna be
Passionately delicious
I don't wanna be
Just like everyone else on the list
I don't wanna be
Passion to be delicious
I don't wanna be
Just like everyone else on the list
Just think what I might have missed
