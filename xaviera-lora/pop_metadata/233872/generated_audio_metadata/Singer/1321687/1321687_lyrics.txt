I come to you again from so far away
The road is long and hard and I have strayed
I did not ask for help when I was lost
You waited patiently and you knew the cost
The world is cruel and bleak without your love
But you reach down to me from up above
Now your voice I hear, I stretch out my hand
Though my faith is still as small as a grain of sand
Then I am nourished by the bread of your power
And I am filled with the wine of your grace
When I'm blinded by doubt in the darkest hour
Then I am guided by the light of your face
I come to you again from so far away
The road is long and hard and I have strayed
Then Your voice I hear
I stretch out my hand
Though my faith is still as small as a grain of sand
But I am nourished by the bread of Your power
And I am filled with the wine of Your grace
When I'm blinded by doubt in the darkest hour
Then I am guided by the light of your face
Now I am nourished by the bread of your power
And I am filled with the wine
Now I am nourished by the bread of your power
And I am filled with the wine
