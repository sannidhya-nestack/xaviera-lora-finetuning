Shadows fall upon a tired city
Winter covers it with gold
Tension comes across a million faces
The burden grows upon our shoulders
I just want to have a river to myself
A refuge from the daily rain
I've just got to have a river to myself
That even when I'm gone will still be me
The city goes about its frenzied business
It never stops to feel the breeze
I am thrown amongst the mass confusion
Playing for my place of peace
I just want to have a river to myself
A refuge from the daily rain
I've just got to have a river to myself
That even when I'm gone will still remain
Amen
Rain, rain, rain
Another day inside the spinning city
Ambitious hearts and eyes of fear
I can sense my distant refuge calling
But something always keeps me here
I just want to have a river to myself
A refuge from the daily rain
I just got to have a river to myself
That even when I'm gone will still remain
That even when I'm gone will still remain
That even when I'm gone will still remain
