Man I'm tired of these dirt roads lining my path
I'm rambling but God I don't know how long I'll last
Sometimes I think I'd be better off dead
Just can't believe she got in my head
And I'm rolling and you're rambling
I lost my soul in that town
That's why I'm rolling
And you're rambling
Trying to run from that cursed place
It's alright
I'll be okay
I'll make it through
Somehow
I'm alright
I'll be okay
I'll figure it out somehow
And all I want is a simple life
Where nothing changes
Rolling prairie in the sky
Make my own wages
Working the ground
I feel myself falling down
I've lost all control
And time moving too fast
Will hit me here
Rambling takes its toll on your soul
Good thing I lost my soul long ago
I'm looking out for a new home
I'm looking for peace'cause it's been hard
And I roll through America's countryside
The sun drops over Highway 51
Everything glows in green and gold
Damn it looks so pretty
And I'm rollin' (you're rollin') and you're ramblin' (and you're ramblin')
I lost my soul in that town
That's why I'm rollin' (you're rollin') and you're ramblin' (and you're ramblin')
Tryna run from that cursed place
It's alright (don't you know) I'll be okay (don't you know)
I'll make it through (don't you know) somehow (don't you know)
I'm alright (don't you know) I'll be okay (don't you know)
I'll figure it out somehow
And all I want is a simple life
Where nothing changes
Rolling prairie in the sky
Make my own wages
Working the ground
I feel myself falling down
I've lost all control
When time moving too fast will hit me in
