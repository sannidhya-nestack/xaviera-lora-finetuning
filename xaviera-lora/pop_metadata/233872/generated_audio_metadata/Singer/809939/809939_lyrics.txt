So tired of playing games now
I'm moving on et ya
Pull anchors up away now
I'll be alone and so will you
So will you
Sometimes I feel like I don't know why
I even try
Why even try
I've been waiting all my life
For a dream to come true
It's not coming true
Maybe I was to blame
But so were you
We could have worked it out
Triumphant truth
All the hotels and airplanes that you use
All have more luck than me
All that keeps me going these days
Is the possibility of something coming true
You just keep playing me, not letting go
And I just keep loving you
But you won't know
No, you don't know
So tired of playing games now
I'm moving on from ketchup
Pull anchors up and wait now
I'll be in moving soon with you
Soon with you
So tired of playing them games now
I'm moving on from ketchup
Pull anchors up and wait now
I'll be alone and so will you
So will you
So tired of playing games now
I'm moving on, et ya
Pull anchors up and wait now
I'll be alone and so will you
So will you, so will you
