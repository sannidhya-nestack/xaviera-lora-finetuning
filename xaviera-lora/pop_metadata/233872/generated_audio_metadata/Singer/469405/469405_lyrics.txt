Looking through old photographs of lovers I once had
Some blew through like a summer storm and some just made me laugh
Drinkers, smokers, ballroom jokers, you know I've had my share
Paying dues in the hard luck school of lousy love affairs
But now circles come around
What was lost now is found
Pullman silver on the ground
Darling you are living proof
Love arrives when it is due
Here's one of me at seventeen ready to enact
A steamy scene from a novel read behind my parents' back
But one by one the stars fell from my disillusioned eyes
And romance became a dirty word somewhere along the line
But now the circles come around
For what was lost now is found
Full moon and silver on the grass
Darling, you are living true
Love arrives when it is due
Oh, I can tell you some love war stories
Two tom-toms and no cow-terriers
But each one was a lesson true
That brought me here to loving you
The circles come around
What was lost now is found
Full moon, silver on the ground
Darling you are living proof
Love arrives when it is due
The circles come around
What was lost now is found
Full moon, silver on the ground
Darling, you are living proof
Love arrives when it is due
