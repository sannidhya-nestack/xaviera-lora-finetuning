Don't tell me that you'll call tomorrow
But I won't tell you I'm gonna write
Don't tell me that our parting brings you sorrow
Let's not call it
Wrong or right
Don't make a promise we can't keep
Those easily turn into lies
I'm in love with what we have this moment
It works to kill the loneliness inside
No promises, no lies
I don't own you and you don't own me
No promises, no lies
It's just nice we can set each other free
I'd like to think that this could last forever
But I've felt that way so many times before
I've learned that I've no contract on the future
I've learned to say thanks without expecting more
No promises, no lies
I don't own you and you don't own me
No promises, no lies
It's just nice we can set each other free
