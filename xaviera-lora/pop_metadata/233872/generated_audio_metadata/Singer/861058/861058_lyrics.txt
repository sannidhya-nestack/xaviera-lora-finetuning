It's the way you never fake
That makes me wanna fly
It's the way you give and take
That takes me by surprise
Spend a lifetime sitting down
I was trying to lay in the fence
And you get that feeling now
You know the way it's meant
Now I don't feel afraid of this trend
And I don't see the need for an end
It's the way you do those things
That makes me lose control
It's the way I know you think
That's singing to my soul
Spend a lot of time worrying
About what's gonna change
Now you're so enlightening
I'm walking in the rain
Now I don't feel the pain of this trend
And I don't see the need for an end
Now I don't feel afraid of this trend
And I might wanna stay till the end
