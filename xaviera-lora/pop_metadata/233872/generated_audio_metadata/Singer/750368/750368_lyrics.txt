Do ya do? Do ya do? Do ya do?
I ain't got much money
And I don't look like the rest
Well I don't do what they do
But I still try my best
Well, I used to know love before it went wrong
Now all I've got left are the words to this song
Well, in the quiet of the night
Yeah, that's my world
And I still think about it
The love for a girl
When we were rich without money
And we were happy without a home
In a place we could dream
But now it's all gone
As quick as it came
It all disappeared
And it doesn't get easier
Despite all these years
Well if I had lots of money
And if I looked like the rest
If I did what they did
Know I'd still try my best
But would I still know love
Or would it all be gone
And would all I have left be a song
Would all I have left be a song?
Would all I have left be a song?
Would all I have left
