Missed your bus, running late
What's the rush, you'll get there all the same
Your umbrella in the rain flies away
You get wet, so who cares anyway
It's okay, it's alright, let it go
We'll be fine
It ain't so bad
here we are
I've got some wine
We've got the stars
So raise your glass
Don't be so sad
A toast to us
You know it really ain't so bad
There are times I get so mad over nothing and you make me laugh
No, there ain't no use in crying
We could find the silver lining in all that we have
It's okay, it's alright, let it go
We'll be fine, it ain't so bad'cause here we are
I've got some wine, we've got the stars
So raise your glass, don't be so sad
A toast to us, you know it really ain't so bad
Life can get you high
Or it can make you cry
Let's enjoy the ride this time
It ain't so bad'cause here we are
I've got some wine, we've got the stars
So raise your glass, don't be so sad
A toast to us, you know it really ain't so bad
We've got the stars, don't be so sad
A toast to us, you know it really ain't so bad, so bad
