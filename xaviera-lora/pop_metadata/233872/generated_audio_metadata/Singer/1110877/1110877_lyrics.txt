Introduced by an angel
And from that moment on
Everything started changing
We found something so strong
You never stopped learning
Always remember things I love
Now you're the one who knows me
Better than anyone
If I'm gonna stay up all night
There's no one else I'd rather stay up with
A coffee shop that's open late
Is the perfect kind of place
To meet your verses
Ah, that's where a love story begins
And when you care for someone
You give them all of you
It's that complete devotion
With everything you do
Can't wait to watch another
Ten years go skipping by
It's always your intention to make a beautiful life
If I'm gonna stay up all night
There's no one else I'd rather stay up with
A coffee shop that's open late
Is the perfect kind of place
To meet your person
That's where a love story begins
If I'm gonna stay up all night
There's no one else I'd rather stay up with
Coffee shop that's open late
Is the perfect kind of place
To meet your person
Ah, that's where a love story begins
