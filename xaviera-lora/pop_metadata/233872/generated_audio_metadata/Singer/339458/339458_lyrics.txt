9am in my local cafe
Reading the news while I sip my latte
Interview with a family
Of a young man who's been missing since last week
His name is Specialist Jimenez
And they still have hope, his cousin says
They found his buddy in the Euphrates
Still they haven't stopped praying for his release
But the people walking by
Don't hear a single cry
Only the far off sigh of distant thunder
5pm, pour a glass of red wine
Watching TV as I try to unwind
Some small town kids in Ohio
Working on an'85 Camaro
They wanna get it running for Keith
He loved that car, worked on it every leave
He said, "Have it ready for me when I get back"
So they'll dress up in black and drive it down the main street
But the people walking by don't hear a single cry
Only the far-off sky of distant thunder
And we go on with our lives
While others pay the price
And never hear the cries of distant thunder
A thousand distractions fill my day
The dark clouds feel so far away
I guess it's easy to ignore
The gathering storm
Till the lightning strikes near you
But the people walking by
Don't hear a single cry
Only far off sight
Distant thunder
And we go on with our lives
While others pay the price
Never hear the cries of distant thunder
