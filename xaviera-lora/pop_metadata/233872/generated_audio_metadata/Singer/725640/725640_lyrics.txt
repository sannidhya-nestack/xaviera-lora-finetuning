One step closer to the edge
And one move closer to the brink of extinction
One step closer to the ledge
I'm moving slowly but there is no
Distinction between what's gone
And what's to come along
So I'll be waiting
Contemplating so long
So long
Ooh, one step closer to the fall
I'm one move closer to the thrill of it all
One step closer to the flame
It's burning faster than an inner city train between
What's gone and what's to come along
So I'll be waiting
Contemplating so long
So long
Ooh
Clock ticks only one way
Forwards, and even though
If only I could turn back time, time
With every second passing by
Me now could be the start
Of something new, of something beautiful
Oh
One step closer to the edge
And one move closer to the brink of extinction
One step closer to the ledge
I'm moving slowly but there is no distinction
Between what's gone and what's to come along
So I'll be waiting, contemplating so long, so long, so long, oh
So long
