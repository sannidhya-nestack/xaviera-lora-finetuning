Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-uh

Uh-uh
Da-da-da-da-da-Da-da-da, da-da
Uh-uh
Da-da-da-da-da-DA, da-da-da-da
Oh, I am, I'm so hungry
To live here and feel free
You know the sun gives always more for you and me
I am crunching in my nature and feeling free
Under the sun
I feel free
Under the sun
For now
Just, just you and me
Our lives can be so easy
You know the sun gives always more for you and me
I am running on my true life and feel free under the sun
I feel free under the sun
You know the sound is giving us a chance to be, to be free, to be free, to be free
