I put my faith in our future, and it looks bright
And if our world comes down around us, we'll still be alright
I got soul in my pocket and love in my heart tonight
We're going for a ride
You better hang on tight
We've been through the fire
And come out unscathed
We give it up for love
And we keep the faith
You give me everything I need
Oh yes you do
You give me everything I need
Oh yes you do
You got a way to get to me
Real deep inside
And when I'm lost or hurt or broken
You can turn the tide
You've got a heart you keep open
It's shining like a neon sign
A warm and welcome light
That says you're mine, all mine
And when I need a father, you can fill the bill
But when I need a lover, then you say you will
You give me everything I need, oh yes you do
You give me everything I need, oh yes you do, oh no no
And anytime we parted, I can see your face
And feel your sweet emotion reach across the space
You give me everything, oh yes you do
You give me everything I need, oh yeah, yes you do
You know, you know, you give me everything
Oh yes you do, my sweet baby you do
You give me everything
Oh yes you do, I know I have to see everything
