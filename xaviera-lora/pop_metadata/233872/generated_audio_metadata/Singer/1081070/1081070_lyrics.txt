All the work was hard and the wage is low
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
I guess it's time for us to go
And it's time for us to leave her
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
Oh, the voyage is done and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her
Oh, I thought I heard the old man say
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
Oh, tomorrow you will get your pay
And it's time for us to leave her
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
Oh, the voyage is done and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her
The winds blew foul and the seas ran high
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
We shipped up green and none went by
And it's time for us to leave her
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
Oh, the voyage is done and the winds don't blow
And it's time
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
All the voyage is done and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
All the voyage is done and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her
Well I pray that we shall never more see
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
A hungry ship the likes of she
And it's time for us to leave her
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
Oh, the voyage is done and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her
Oh, the voyage is done and the winds don' blow
And it's time for us to leave her
