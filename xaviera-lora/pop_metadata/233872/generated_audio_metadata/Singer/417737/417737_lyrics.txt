Sometimes we make it big
Sometimes small
The often found we just carve our backs against the wall
You follow me around
Pushing your luck
When I finally turn around you're gone and I'm stuck
You see it's all around you
Even though you can't see
I tried my best to
Give you what you needed
Though I'm glad I found you
I'm sad you lost me
Sorry I said so
Can't leave but please
Just let me be
So many days and nights
Just fill in space
When everything but me seems to have its own place
You tell me you want it all
Then some more
When I try to give you a hug, I walk out the door
You see it's all around you
Even though you can't see
I tried my best to give you what you needed
Though I'm glad I found you
I'm sad you lost me
Sorry I say it so candidly
But please just
Let me be
How do I stop this train before it's off it's tracks
I can't turn around no no I can't look back
You're driving me insane you cut me no slack
Is it too much to ask I just want my life back
Cause it's all around you even though you can't see
I tried my best to give you what you needed
Though I'm glad I found you, I'm sad you lost me
Sorry I say it so candidly but please just
Oh please just
Oh please just let me be
