I close my eyes I wanna escape
Like a new found American jam
I feel a healing within my soul
But I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win again
I feel your ears, I feel the air
You don't like it, I don't care
You can hear me anywhere
Now I'll finally make my stand
In Radio Land
Everything in my command
In Radio Land
Be my love, be my friend
You'll hear me in the air
In Radio Land
I walk this road a thousand times
And I played my tunes, I sang my rhymes
And I feel I'm running out of time
But I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win
Don't bother asking what it's worth
It's a blessing, it's a curse
I found my mother earth
And I will finally make my stand
In Radio Land
Never fade my command
In Radio Land
Be my lover, be my friend
You'll hear me in the end
In Radio Land
Radio, Radio, Radio Land
I feel your ears, I feel the air
You don't like it, I don't care
You can hear me anywhere
Now you'll finally make my stand (in Radioland)
Everything in my command (in Radioland)
Be my lover, be my friend
You will hear me in the air (in Radioland)
Baby you're there
Baby you're there
