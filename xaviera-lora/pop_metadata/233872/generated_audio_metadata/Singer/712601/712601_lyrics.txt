Six hours away
I've got so much that I need to say
And for that I'll pray
That I'll see you again someday
The end came too soon
But when you're in my arms there was no end to you
Pick up my call, let us fall in love
This mental image of you is all I have left to hold
Pick up my call, let us fall in love
You're beautiful, and with you I want to unfold
You're busy now I guess
And now I get no rest
These last months
We haven't spoken
So I'm telling you now
I'm fully open and without you
I feel I'm broken
The end came too soon
But when you were in my arms
There was no end to you
Pick up my call
Let us fall in love
This mental image of you is all I have left to hold
Pick up my call, let us fall in love
You're beautiful and with you I want to unfold
Please pick up one call
One call is all I need
Please pick up one call
At least so I can rest in peace
You're still busy I guess
And still I get no rest
I can't keep my mind off of you
And now I'm getting too tired to test it
Oh baby you guessed it
I'm a wreck without you
You're beautiful
One call is all I need
Please pick up one call
At least so I can rest in peace
