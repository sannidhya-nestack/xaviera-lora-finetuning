A shooting star just crossed the skies
And burned its trail into my eyes
It fell to earth, I don't know where
I wish to God that I was there
I looked up at an aeroplane and wished that I was on it
Flying somewhere far away in my Sunday bib and bonnet
The birds and clouds fly over me
Forever wild, forever free
And I am stuck here in the mud
My hands are caked with grime and blood
Can I turn this ship around
Can I even stop it
Can I juggle one more ball
Or am I doomed to drop it
Shooting stars are hard to find
Look too long and you'll go blind
Lose your reason, lose your sight
Lose your sense of what is right
Next time I see a shooting star
I'll follow it however far
And I won't let it slip away
And I won't waste another day
