Mmm, mmm, mmm
The sky flows by, why do I see my colors changing?
I'm so high I could fly but I'm still complaining
Run for fun but I'm done chasing you and I've got nothing left to lose
I've got to get out of this hole for two, baby blue
Now is not the season for believing there's a reason I should choose between the two of you
I think about that drink how I might sink but I'm staying here for a few
Marry'em, cherry'em, oh she's got that yum-yum-yum
And Hannah with that bun and what I can't stand I might just marry'em both, oh hold the phone
No, I don't condone if these two roads won't lead to gold
Both these girls should leave this boy alone
Leave me alone, mmm
Time is mine, oh was, oh
But now it's hers and fine
I've crossed that line
And it's getting worse
So true to do you who
Now I'm confused
It's nothing new
You know I knew
That I might come unglued
Baby blue
Now is not the season for believing
There's a reason I should choose
Between the two of you
I think about the drink
How I might sink
But I'm staying here for a few
Marry'em, cherry'em
Oh she's got that yum-yum-yum
And hand'em with that banana
Well I can't stand her
I might just marry'em both
Oh hold the phone
No, I don't condone if these two roads won't lead to gold
Both these girls should leave this boy alone
What can you do?
Now is not the season for believing there's a reason I should choose
Between the two of you
I think about the drink, how I might sing
But I'm staying here with you
Marry'em, cherry'em
Oh, she's got that yum yum yum
And Hannah with that banana
Well, I can't stand it, might just marry'em both
Oh, hold the phone
No, I don't condone
If these two roads won't lead to gold
Both these girls should leave
Marium, cherrium, oh she's got that yum yum yum
Hanging with that banana, well I can't stand her, I might just
Marium, both, oh, hold the phone, no I don't condone
If these two roads won't lead to gold
Both these girls should leave this boy alone
If these two roads won't lead to gold
Both these girls should leave
This boy alone
