Silk sheet, memory
You kissed me, no sleep
Did we, or was it just a sweet dream
Red wine, midnight
Blue eyes, hold tight
White lies, figure it out in the morning light
We were like two lovers on the streets of Paris
Strangers under city lights, our hearts were careless
Running full speed into reckless abandon
Not knowing where we're going
Just drowning in the moment
We were like two lovers on the streets of Paris
Slow moves, vinyl blues
Perfume, tattoos, oh
Time was all that we had to lose
We were like two lovers on the streets of Paris
Strangers under city lights, our hearts were careless
Running full speed into reckless abandon
Not knowing where we're going
Just drowning in the moment
We were like two lovers on the streets of Paris
Oh, I
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, we were like two lovers on the streets of Paris
Strangers under city lights, our hearts were careless
Running full speed into reckless abandon
Not knowing where we're going, just drowning in the moment
We were like two lovers on the streets of Paris
On the streets of Paris
On the streets of Paris
