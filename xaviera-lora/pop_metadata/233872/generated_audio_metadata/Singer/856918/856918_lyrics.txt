What colour are the thoughts in my head?
What colour are the words I have said?
There's nothing worse than dying slow
There's nothing more dangerous than what you know
What color are the thoughts in my head
What is the weight of the tears in my eyes
How would you know me without my disguise
I walk through rain without getting wet
But I haven't walked through all of it yet
What is the weight of the tears in my eyes?
It seems the only way to win is to make you lose
It seems the only way to stay is to make you move
It seems the only way to win is to make you lose
It seems the only way to take is to make you choose
What is the worth of the life in my hands
Here were two trees but they no longer stand
There's no more a street where I used to live
There are no more excuses for me to give
What is the worth of these lives in my hands
I thought the only way to win was to make you lose
I thought the only way to stay was to make you move
I thought the only way to win was to make you lose
I thought the only way to take was to make you choose
What color are the thoughts in my head
What color are the words I have said
There's nothing worse than dying slow
There's nothing more dangerous than what you don't know
