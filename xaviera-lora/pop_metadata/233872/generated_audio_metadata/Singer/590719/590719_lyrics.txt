He woke up on the wall, his heavy uniform
Some put that gun away, but he doesn't plan to obey
his mind's made up, he was trained for that
And that's the only thing he'll say
he's blind, you see
All his hatred failed
And now his world has gone astray
Son, save your soul
Son, save your soul
For so long
I once had heard her say
My life is not the one I used to dream of
And all I do is pray
But it doesn't work from where I come from
And I pray for a change beyond my rage
But I don't feel that anymore
My soul is safe'cause I work all day
And I bring my mind home
Son, save your soul
Son, save your soul
You've been wrong for so long
There is nothing I desire
But I'm still dreaming
And the few things I admire
Don't have much meaning
Not a thing touches my soul
One thing I must fight
To keep myself from dreaming
Few things I desire
But I wake up screaming
Not a thing touches my soul
Not a thing touches my soul
Now she left when morning came
she couldn't place the blame
His dreams became a wall
At forehead is just a toll
In my new suit all, outside of Rome
He brings me flowers everyday
And my life feels right
We go out at night
And he always wants to pay
Some say you're so
Some say it's so
You've been wrong for so long
