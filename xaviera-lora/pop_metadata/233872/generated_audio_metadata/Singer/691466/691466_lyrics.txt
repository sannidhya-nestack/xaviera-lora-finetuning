I'm gonna marry you in the summer when the air is warm and sweet
I'm gonna take your hand in mine and then I'll sweep you off your feet
We're gonna wake up every morning'neath a cool and crisp white sheet
I'm gonna marry you in the summer when the air is warm and sweet
I'm gonna marry you in the summer
In the church that's near my home
Near the places as a child that I did play and I did roam
These memories they echo as they fade into the heat
I'm gonna marry you in the summer when the air is warm and sweet
I love the love you give me
I hold your hand so tight
I treasure every single moment
You're the girl that is my bride
There was something extra special in your eyes when we did meet
My heart began to flutter and I found it hard to speak
What magic do you radiate? That magic do I seek?
I'm gonna marry you in the summer when the air is warm and sweet
I love the love you give me
I hold your hand so tight I treasure every single moment
You're the girl that is my bride
I'd love the love you give me
I hold your hand so tight
I treasure every single moment
You're the girl that is my bride
I'm gonna marry you in the summer
When the air is warm and sweet
I'm gonna take your hand in mine
And then I'll sweep you off your feet
We're gonna wake up every morning
Leave the cool and crisp white sheet
I'm gonna marry you in the summer
When the air is warm and sweet
I love the love you give me
I hold your hand so tight
I'll treasure every single moment
You're the girl that is my wife
I love the love you give me
I hold your hand so tight
I'll treasure every single moment
You're the girl that is my wife
