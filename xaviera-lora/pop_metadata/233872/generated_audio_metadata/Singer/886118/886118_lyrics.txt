I walk alone the city streets
I smile at everyone I meet
I try to find some good in there
But I just see desperation looming
A street guy then a paraplegic man
He smiles at me I don't understand
It feels like someone stuck something into me
So I search through the grey and the sadness
For a little peace, for a little gladness
Remind myself there's love out there
Through the dark un iving stairs
But still I seem to feel so lonely
And I ask the sun to promise me
And ask the wind to set me free
And ask the stars to promise me
That faith will one day find a way
That faith will make me wanna stay
In my heart
In my heart
I feel like a stranger but I always have
Even back home with mom and dad
Sometimes feels like no one really knows me
Eleanor Rigby passing by
Everyone's a robot and no one cries
Except the junkies on the side
And the birds above who fly by me
So I go into my mind and find
A bit of hope that's been left behind
And though I don't feel it inside
I have to believe it'll come back
With the changing tide
And I ask the sun to promise me
And I ask the wind to set me free
And I ask the stars to promise me
The faith will one day find a way
The faith will make me want to stay
In my heart
In my heart
One bird, two birds, three birds, four birds, five birds, six birds, seven birds, it birds for life
One bird, two birds, three birds, four birds, five birds, six birds, seven birds, eight birds fly
Fly, fly
From my heart, from my heart, from my heart
