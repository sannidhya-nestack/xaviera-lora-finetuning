Please ive me for what I'm about to say
But I know in my heart you wouldn't have wanted it this way
I'm sorry but I never thought it would take your lifetime to see
How much you really meant to me
I swear I can hear your voice crying in the wind, say
Life is too short to let it pass you by
Don't take things too hard and sweet please don't cry
Sometimes you gotta let it go
When I have the chance to show you what I'm feeling today
You wanted more from me than I could give away
Now looking through your child's eyes it's easy to see
You're an angel watching over me
I swear I can hear your voice crying in the wind say
Life is too short to let it pass you by
Don't take things to heart and sweetie please don't cry
Sometimes you gotta let it go
I swear I can hear your voice crying in the wind say
Life is too short to let it pass you by
Don't take things too hard and sweetie please don't cry
Sometimes you gotta let it go
Sometimes you gotta let it go
Let it go
