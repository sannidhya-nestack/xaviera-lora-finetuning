Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Heart cuffs sitting sinking
I know I've been thinking
A heart cuff's only what you feel inside
And baby remember little memories
Right on time and maybe
A heart cuff lover leaving
Don't know why, but it's true, you do, oh
You want me to stay, and it's true
It's too late, to run away
What can I do, I can't move when
I'm stuck in my place, but baby
I will be the end of you
And you will be the end of me too
I will be the end of you
And you will be the end of me too
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Hardcuff broken bleeding
Cause you know what I'm needing
A hardcuff song ain't just a frame of mind
And baby I couldn't even fly away
If I tried and maybe
Hardcuff captivating
Love is blind, but it's true, you do, oh
You want me to stay, and it's true
It's too late to run away
What can I do? I can't move when I'm stuck in my place
But baby, I will be the end of you
And you will be the end of me too
I will be the end of you
And you will be the end of me too
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
But it's true, you do, oh, you want me to stay
And it's true, it's too late to run away
What can I do, I can't move when I'm stuck in my place
But baby, I will be the end of you
And you will be the end of me too
Say I will be the end of you
And you will be the end of me too
