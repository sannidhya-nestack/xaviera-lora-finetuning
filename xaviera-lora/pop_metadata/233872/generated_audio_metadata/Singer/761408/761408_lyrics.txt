And I have so many questions
You make them go away
This broken hearted cynical girl is thinking about asking you to stay
And maybe I'm crazy to think that you might be all that you say
Or maybe I'm lucky'cause I get to lie in your arms
While you take the lies from my head either way
Maybe I'm lucky
And I have so many answers
They don't make sense no more
'Cause you came around and made me believe in
Something I'd given up on long before
And maybe I'm crazy to think that you might be
All that you say
Or maybe I'm lucky'cause I get to lie in your arms
While you take the last from my head
Either way
Maybe I'm lucky
And I'm not saying that you're the one, but
I'm not saying that you're not
I just wanted to thank you for letting me find out
Maybe I'm crazy to think that you might be all that you say
Or maybe I'm lucky'cause I get to lie in your arms
While you take the lies from my head
Either way, either way, either way
Maybe I'm lucky
Either way
Maybe I'm lucky
Either way
Thank you either way
