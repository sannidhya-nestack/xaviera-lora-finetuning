Here, last summertime
You I found in my hometown
Just floating by
Like autumn leaves blow
But nothing else but yourself blew me to my knees
And then in winter days
We could go out in the snow
And watch them fade
To days of spring
Where all my love for you will grow
And my heart will sing
I held your hands then realized I was free
From all that's don't call misery
Don't know just what you mean to me
And I will bless you night and day and night
Forsake you anyway
Na na na na na
And so the summer goes
Day after day, year after year, whatever will it bring?
Four seasons changing, but oh my love for you will grow
And my heart will sing
Four seasons changing, but oh my love for you will grow
Oh my love, for you will grow
And my heart will sing
For seasons changing
But oh my love
For you will grow and my heart will sing
For seasons changing
But oh my love
For you will grow and my heart will sing
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
