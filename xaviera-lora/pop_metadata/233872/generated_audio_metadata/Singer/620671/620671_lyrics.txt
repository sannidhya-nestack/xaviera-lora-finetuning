I am patient
Slightly bruised but I'll survive
I know I'll make it
I'll never stop while I'm alive
I am patient
A little scared, but who is not? I'll try to face it
And you're with me, that means a lot
Well, I've chosen living, I've chosen living every day
Yes, I've chosen living, I don't think there's any other way
And I will not stop dreaming
No, I will not stop dreaming this time
Life is patient, moving slowly as the breeze
And if you catch it, this life will give you all you need
So I chose in living
I choose in living every day
Yes I choose in living
I don't think there's any other way
And I will not stop dreaming
No, I will not stop dreaming
No, I will not stop dreaming this time
