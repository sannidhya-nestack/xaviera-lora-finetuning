Oh young man, rejoice in youth, oh sing thy song
But one of these days your heyday will be gone
A life for you is caviar, fine wine and sweet meringue
Enjoy it and hope you never taste hunger pain
You feel so strong, so looked up to
So righteous and so sure
Tomorrow you might not feel that way anymore
Oh hey days, like one that's so sweet
Never think to hold them and they creep up while we sleep
In the ancient Roman times
Slave whispered in your ear
Remember chief someday it'll all disappear
One day you'll have to give it back
All those things you stole
Not even you can beat time's gallows pole
Be careful what you leave behind
Be careful what you keep
What seems shallow now can turn so deep
Oh, hate is like wine that's so sweet
Never think to hold them and they break off bit by bit
For every conquest there's a photograph
But someday they'll only make your daughter's laugh
And next time you tell yourself it'll never end
Remember it'll never be this easy again
In these days while you're on top
Be good through and through
This time has a funny way of catching up with you
Xboxing champ holding doors for others to walk through
In his heyday he was a lot like you
Genesis says our prime is sure
She sees it in your poem
And one of these days your heyday will be gone
Oh heydays like one that's so sweet
Never think to hold them and they creep off while we sleep
Oh hey Dave, oh hey Dave
Oh hey Dave, hey Dave, hey Dave
Go so far, go so fast, hey Dave
