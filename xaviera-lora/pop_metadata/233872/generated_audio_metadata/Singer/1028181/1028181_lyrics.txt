I went down to the riverside
To wash away the tears I've cried
I wish that I could shed my skin
And find a way to start again
I'm out of luck and out of time
The trouble weighs upon my mind
My heart is buried in my bones
And the ghosts around me won't let go
Somewhere in the dark beyond the moon
They're calling out to me
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The ghosts around me won't let go
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
But the ghosts around me won't let go
Caught between the earth and sky
Like a boat on a rising tide
I can see a light beyond the blue
Miles to go and much to do
A sea of emptiness so deep
I'm losing touch, I'm losing sleep
I'm trying to find my way back home
But the goose around me won't let go
I hear their voices in the wind
They're calling me again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
No, the ghosts around me won't let go
But the ghosts around me won't let go
I feel them pull me close
Will they ever leave me alone
But the ghosts around me won't let go
The ghosts around me
Ooh, ooh, ooh (hey)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (hey)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (hey)
The ghosts around me won't let go
Ooh, ooh, ooh (hey)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (hey)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The ghosts around me won't let go
