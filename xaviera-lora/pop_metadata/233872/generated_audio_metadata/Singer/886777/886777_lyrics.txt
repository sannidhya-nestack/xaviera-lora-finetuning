You
You
You
You
In the ways of the weak, the time's been bleak, I know
You're the fight, the cream, the strength in me, I know
And you're driving, driving, driving, driving me crazy
You keep on running and running and running and running lately
Slow down, you go too fast love
I'm telling slow down, I can't keep up love
In the ways of the weak, the time's been bleak, I know
You're the fight, the cream, the strength in me, I know
And you're driving, driving, driving, driving me crazy
You keep on running and running and running and running lately
Slow down, you go too fast love
I'm telling slow down, I can't keep up love
Your heart is shrinking faster
And baby there's no laughter coming out of your mouth
Out of your soul, out of your soul
I'm wasting, keep running
Impatient sweet lover
