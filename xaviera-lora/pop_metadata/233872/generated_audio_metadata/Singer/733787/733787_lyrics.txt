You were right, I was wrong, silence fills the room
Sure as night follows day, it all ends too soon
Understand what went wrong, peace is on the floor
Letting go of the past
Crying at the door
And hope don't live here no more
Just broken promises
And don't you speak another word
It's all been said before
I'm sorry that I tied you down
And kept you from your life
Now you can do all those things
You couldn't as a wife
I'm sorry that I made you cry
It eats me up inside
Someday babe you'll realize
That this wasn't right
And hope don't live here no more
Just broken promises
And don't you speak another word
It's all been said before
So upset with myself
How could I go wrong?
No one else cared this much
About my stupid songs
Suddenly realized
Left it all behind
You loved me but you couldn't help my tortured mind
And hope don't live here no more
Just broken promises and don't you speak another word
It's all been said before
Close the door
Go to sleep
It'll work out right
Tomorrow is another day
The sun it shines so bright
But hope don't live here no more
Just broken promises and don't you speak
Another world
It's all been said before
