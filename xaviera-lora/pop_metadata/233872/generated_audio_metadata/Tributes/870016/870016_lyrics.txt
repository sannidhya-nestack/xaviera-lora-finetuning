When the love goes
I keep feeling like
I won't ever be this high up again
And I tell myself
Don't you rest yourself
You can be the one who flies up again
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Woah
Oh woah
Oh woah
Oh woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
When the love goes, I keep feeling like
I won't ever be this high up again
And I tell myself, don't you rest yourself
You can be the one who flies up again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
[Screaming]
