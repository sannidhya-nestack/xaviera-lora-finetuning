Give me my money back
Don't really think this is what I wanted
You know as a matter of fact
This is nowhere close to what I had in mind
Give me my money back
Don't really think this is what I wanted
You know as a matter of fact
This is nowhere close to what I had in mind
You said we'd cross the ocean
But you're too scared to swim
You swore you'd teach me sports
But you won't let me win
You said that we'd climb mountains
You walk on level ground
You'd teach me how to skate
But you keep falling down
I bought what you were saying
But you don't think like me
Give me my money back
Don't really think this is what I wanted
You know as a matter of fact
This is nowhere close to what I had in mind
Give me my money back
Don't really think this is what I wanted
You know as a matter of fact
This is nowhere close to what I had in mind
You said we'd go to Paris
But you're too scared to fly
You swore that you'd protect me
But you're not on my side
You said you'd take me fishing
But you won't touch the bait
You said we'd watch the stars
But you won't stay up late
I bought what you were saying
But you don't think like me
Give me my money back
Don't really think this is what I wanted
You know as a matter of fact
This is nowhere close to what I had in mind
Give me my money back
Don't really think this is what I wanted
You know as a matter of fact
This is nowhere close to what I had in mind
I bought what you were saying
But you don't think like me
Give me my money back
Don't really think this is what I wanted
You know as a matter of fact
This is nowhere close to what I had in mind
Give me my money back
Don't really think this is what I wanted
You know as a matter of fact
This is nowhere close to what I had in mind
Give me my money back
Don't really think this is what I wanted
Give me my money back
This is nowhere close to what I had in mind
Give me my money back
Don't really think this is what I wanted
You know as a matter of fact
This is nowhere close to what I had in mind
