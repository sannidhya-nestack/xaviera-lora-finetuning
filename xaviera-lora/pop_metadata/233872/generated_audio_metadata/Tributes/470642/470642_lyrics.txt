I was high on a mountain
When my world came tumbling down
I was fine'til I stumbled
Now I've got to pick myself off the ground
Now the war may be over
But the fight has only just begun
I'm taking little steps until I get better
Little steps I make every day
Little steps we take together
Every day you're gonna hear me say
I'm gonna be a better man today
I was lost in the darkness
Like a blind man searching for light
But you built in me a fire
I know someday we'll burn bright
So come on and take my hand
And walk with me until it's alright
We're taking little steps until I get better
Little steps I make every day
Little steps we take together
Every day you're gonna hear me say
I'm gonna be a better man today
Little steps until I get better
Little steps we take everyday
Little steps we take together
Hey everyday you're gonna hear me say
Well I'm gonna be a better man today
Little steps, little steps
I'm taking little steps, little steps
