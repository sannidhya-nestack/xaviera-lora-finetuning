If every day was a holiday
I'd be here by your side all the time
We'd have so much fun without a care
There'd be so many good times that we could share
Each morning we'd meet our breakfast in bed
Each night we'd be out on the town
The band would play and we'd dance the night away
If every day was a holiday
And if every day was a holiday
The sun would be shining all the time
We'd walk hand in hand by the riverside
And lay side by side under sunset skies
Each morning we'd eat our breakfast in bed
Each night we'd be out on the town
The band would play and we'd dance the night away
If every day was a holiday
We'd have so much fun without a care
There'd be so many good times that we could share
And each morning we'd eat our breakfast in bed
Each night we'd be out on the town
The band would play and we'd dance the night away
If every day was a holiday
