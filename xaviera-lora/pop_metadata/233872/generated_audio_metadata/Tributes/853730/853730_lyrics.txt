Breathe into me
Take my heart, set me free
You are surreal, things you feel
I'll conceive
Run let's go
Let's make a start
Time is short
From light to dark
Run let's go let's make a start
Time is short from light to dark
You are sublime
Be my prime
Valentine
Make the stars
Turn me true
From light to dark
Make a start
Time is short
From light to dark
Make a start
Time is short
From light to dark
Breathe into me
Take my heart, set it free
