Fourteen at the bomber with a glove in back
Hitting home runs across the railroad tracks
He likes to rock
He likes to roll
Living in the USA, he's an American boy
Sixteen with this grumpy Jesus, long time steady
In a Chevy by the levee, now ready steady go
He likes to rock
He likes to roll
Living in the USA, he's an American boy
He gives it everything that he's got
He gives it everything that he's got
He's hotter than a pepper pot, he's an American boy
Aging with his uniform, he's off to war
Holding it together on a foreign shore
He likes to ride, he likes to roll
Living in the USA, he's an American boy
Twenty-one now is married with a wife and kid
Working nine to five like his daddy did
He likes to rock, mmm, likes to roll
Living in the USA, he's an American boy
He gives it everything that he's got
He gives it everything that he's got
He's hotter than a pepper pot, he's an American boy
He gives it everything that he's got
He gives it everything that he's got
He's hotter than a pepper pot
He's an American boy
