When the road I travel always seems to be the hard way
And the dreams I have, if they don't come true someday
You will be there
You'll take my hand
You're always there for me
You do all that you can
And when everything
In my world goes bad
There's always one dream
That will come true
And that one dream is you
Sometimes life gets so hard
The walk ain't always easy
But your love always shows the way
Oh your love will always please me
And you will be there
You'll take my hand
You're always there for me
You do all that you can
And when everything
In my world goes bad
There's always one dream
That will come true when that one dream is you
Yes you will be there
You'll take my hand
You're always there for me
You do all that you can, yeah
And when everything
In my world goes mad
Oh there's always one dream
That will come true
And that one dream is you
Yes there's always one dream
That will come true
And that one dream is you
And that one dream is you
