Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go
Seemed like yesterday we was on the swings at the park
Gone in the morning home when it's dark
Riding our bikes all through the neighborhood
Getting in trouble because we knew we could
Yeah and could nobody tell us nothing bout life
It was hard but to us everything was alright
Time flies
Time flies
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
