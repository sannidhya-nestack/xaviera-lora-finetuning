You're talking shit, we've died a thousand times
Your tone, your text, your life is so cryptic
Turned your back around in our district
You fight it all, every time that I come around
I heard you rolling, heard you rolling with the big girls now
You got it quick right now, don't give a shit right now
I see you creeping every weekend but you tell me I've got
Problems, well don't we all
But when the sun stops shining and the daylight's locked away
You're in my bedroom grinding, pray we won't go all the way
And now these Hunger Games that you've been making me play
Is starting to change the way that I think about things
You're the one that should be afraid now
But you know I want you
But you know I want you
But you know I want you
You're talking shit
We've died a thousand times
You're tone, your text, your life is so cryptic
Turned your back around in our district
You fight it all
Every time that I come around
I heard you rolling, heard you rolling with the big girls now
You got it quick right now
Don't give a shit right now
I see you creeping every weekend but you tell me I've got
Problems, well don't we all?
But when the sun stops shining and the daylight's locked away
You're in my bedroom grinding, pray we won't go all the way
And now these other games that you've been making me play
Have started to change the way that I think about things
You're the one that should be afraid now
But you know I want you
But you know I want you (but you know I want you)
