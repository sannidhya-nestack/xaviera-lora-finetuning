Turn it up a little more
Get your body moving on the dance floor
I can feel it coming on the right track
There's no turning back, no turning back
Stay with me for all the time
Baby I screamed my name like I'm worth your while
Now I understand how much I care for you
All the love you give me just feels so true
I ain't falling in love, I ain't feeling yeah
But love and the feeling of coming over me
Don't be afraid to put yourself through
I'll never go away and I'll never leave you
It's in your heart, it's in your soul
The love you've given me, it's so cool
Your eyes look like diamonds sparkling in the night
Now it's the time for us to hold on tight, hold on tight
I give you diamonds when you share my life
Now we're gonna get straight to the light, hold on tight
I never found someone like you
I wanna go on loving you
You gonna see me push on through
You gonna know that I'm falling with you
I'm falling in love, I feel it yeah
The love and the feeling are coming over me
Don't be afraid to put yourself through
I'll never go away and I'll never leave you
Get on my track, get on my track
There's no turning back, no turning back
Give me all your love until the world ends
Give me all your love
And now till the world ends
Give me all your love and now till the world ends
Till the world ends
Till the world ends
Your eyes look like diamonds
Sparkling in the night
Now it's the time for us to hold on tight, hold on tight
I hear your diamonds when you share my life
Now we're gonna get straight to the light, hold on tight
