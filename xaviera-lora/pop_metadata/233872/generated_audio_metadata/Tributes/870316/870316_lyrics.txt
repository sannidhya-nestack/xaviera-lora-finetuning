We've got a lot of past and we might be moving fast but
We never ever fell out of love and
You're gonna have to learn and I'm gonna have to burn'cause
You put me through the thick and the tough and we broke up
And we made love
We've got a lot of hills to climb
With you near me I can come alive, come alive
With you near me I can come alive, come alive
With you near me I can come alive, come alike
With you near me I can come alive, come alive
For giving you element of what's to come little you
Running through my blood and bones
Contemplating, we're debating if we should be activating us again
Or just stay friends and will we have a lovers end?
I'm yours and you're mine, still in love and that's fine
We've got a lot of hills to climb
With you near me I can come alive, come alive
With you near me I can come alive, come alive
With you near me I can come alive, come alive
With you near me I can come alive, come alive
You can make me come alive
You can make me come alive
You can make me come alive
