Swear I'm always on the go
Grindin' 24 /7
I promise I ain't never stoppin'
Tell me what you know about it
Tell me what you know'bout, what you know'bout, what you know'bout, what you know'bout, what you know about
Officer, why me do flat like a raft?
Me baby deh ya see, can knock off with jazz
Don't tell me no hoof,'cause we nah play draft
If you never have your gun, me dah tell you chuck off
This is where I'm always gonna go
Grinding 24 /7
I promise I ain't never stopping
Tell me what you know'bout it (Bout it,'bout it)
What dat?
A necks a bust like a cock
A not a ghetto youth inna blood like a chalk
You and your pigs thinking gun cock off
You just kill seven inna rum bar alarm
What you know'bout it (Bout it,'bout it)
What you know'bout it (Bout it,'bout it)
What you know'bout it?
Tell me what you know'bout it
What you know'bout it
What you know'bout it
What you know'bout it
Tell me what you know'bout it
Tell me what you know about
Tell me what you know
