She sits alone inside her room
Thinking of the things that she's done wrong
Putting all the blame on someone else
Doesn't she know about anything?
Looking for the one that fix it all
Take her to a place where she won't fail
Instead of taking time to make things right
Her love for him will save her soul (still blue)
On a shelf, make sure to get someplace else
But you won't be there with me (still blue)
On a shelf, make sure to get someplace else
So call me fifteen times a day
Saying nothing on the other side
Looking for advice or what to do
But she never is listening
She never takes the time to move along
Let herself escape the scene she's in
Sitting on her bed shaking her globe
Praying to find an answer (snow globe)
On a shroud reaching thicker someplace else
But you won't be there with me (still blue)
On a shelf, make you think it's a placehouse
But you won't be there with me
Hopefully she'll change her mind
Escape the pain she feels inside
(Ooh, that would flip the switch)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do -do-do-do-do
So, blow!
I don't shout, but you think it's a placehouse
But you won't be there with me
So, blow!
I don't shout, but you think it's placehouse
But she won't be there with me (so low)
On a shelf, make you think it's some place else
But she won't be there with me (so low)
On a shelf, make you think it's some place else
But she won't be there with me
