Melissa, tell me what you feel
Melissa, tell me what is real
Don't be afraid to speak your mind
Don't talk behind my back
You're always keeping track
Possessing every lie
Melissa, why don't you just come out and say it
Melissa, I think you're a successful fic
I didn't mean to make you cry
I know you weren't impressed
But I only spoke in jest
I didn't mean to cross a line
And now you've got yourself a shining new cause
I know you think it's going to
Take you away so far from us
Melissa, tell me what you feel
Melissa, tell me what is real
Melissa, why don't you just come out and say it
Melissa
Melissa, Melissa
