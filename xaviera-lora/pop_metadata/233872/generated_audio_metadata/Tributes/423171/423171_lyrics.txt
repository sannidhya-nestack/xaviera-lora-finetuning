Hey, Mr. Twelve-String Man, won't you write some words for me?
It's not late, and I've got
Time to hear your tunes and rhymes
Hey Mr. Twelve-String Man
You are a theater's treat
Play us golden guitar tunes
Until the morning light
We'll follow you through the oceans
We'll follow you to the stars
With the magic that you are
And the mysteries in the dark
We'll follow you to dreams in awesome places
There's power on the mountains
And there's beauty in the deep
Where the sunshine cannot peep
On the lost otten keep
Where there's hidden ancient things that lie asleep
Hey, Mr. Twelve-String Man, won't you write some words for me?
It's not late and I've got time to hear your tunes and rhymes
Hey, Mr. Twelve-String Man, come on, set us free
Play us golden guitar tunes until the morning light
We'll wind through misty valleys
Where once great horsemen rode
Those who weary under load
To their towering abode
Where their loved ones left alone
Anxiously waited
Witnesses long ago
The pain of battles waged
Mighty warriors enraged
On bloodied fields engaged
And the sacrifices paid to live in freedom
Hey, Mr. Twelve-String Man, won't you write some words for me?
It's not late, and I've got time to hear your tunes and rhymes
Hey, Mr. Twelve-String Man, come on and set us free
Play us golden guitar tunes until the morning light
Play us golden guitar tunes until the morning light
