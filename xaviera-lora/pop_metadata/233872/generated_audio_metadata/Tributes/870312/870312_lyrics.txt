You're my candy, candy man, candy man (you're the candy man)
I always wanted to feel this way
You give me sweet chocolate, you bring me to Neverland
I never thought this love could be so real
You gave me time to believe
You gave me space to heal
You know what I need
You know exactly when
You know which day to call
You know what to say
You know when not to
You know when you can
You just know you're my handyman
Candyman
You're my candy, candyman
Candyman (you're the candyman)
I always wanted to feel this way
You give me sweet chocolate, you bring me to Neverland
I never thought this love could be so real
You gave me time to believe
You gave me space to heal
You know what I need
You know exactly when
You know which day to call
You know what to say
You know what I'll do
You know when you can
You just know you're my candy man
Angry man
