Walk up the street or down the avenue
With every step I think of you
Forever in my mind
Forever in my mind
Forever in my mind
Every hour of every day forever in my mind
Crazy nights and busy days and you're so far away
Forever in my heart
Thought about you on the midnight train
I reached the joint and thought of you again
Forever in my heart
Forever in mind
Forever in mind
Every hour of every day forever in mind
Crazy nights and busy days and you're so far away
Forever in mind
I got a smile for every girl I see
But I still need you close to me
Forever in mind
Forever in mind
Forever in mind
Every hour of every day forever in mind
Crazy nights and busy days
And you're so far away
Forever in my heart
