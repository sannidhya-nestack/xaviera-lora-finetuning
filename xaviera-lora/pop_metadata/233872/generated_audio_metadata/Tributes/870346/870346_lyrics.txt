Let me dance, I don't wanna go home
The club is closer, yeah, I don't care
Let me dance, let me dance, let me dance
Let me dance, I don't wanna go home
The club is closer, yeah, I don't care
Let me dance, let me dance, let me dance
Let me dance, I don't wanna go home
The club is closer, yeah I don't care
Let me dance, let me dance, let me dance
Let me dance, I don't wanna go home
The club is closer, yeah I don't care
Let me dance, let me dance, let me dance
Rock this club, diamonds on my necklace
Party all night, I ain't tryna see the exit
Remi X so drunk outta my brain
Roll up in the range, I'm outta y'all range
Up in the club, beatin' up
Me and the DJ heatin' it up
Pop in the bottle, no more Moscato
Let's play my jam over, I'll smash your Serato
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Let me dance, I don't wanna go home
The club is closing up, yeah I don't care
Let me dance, let me dance, let me dance
Let me dance, I don't wanna go home
The club is closing up, yeah I don't care
Let me dance, let me dance, let me dance
Let me dance, I don't wanna go home
The club is closing up, yeah I don't care
Let me dance, let me dance, let me dance
Let me dance, I don't wanna go home
The club is closer, yeah I don't care
Let me dance, let me dance, let me dance
Early morn, still poppin' this champagne
It's a perfect storm
Self made, entrepreneur
Won't see the whole thing so she off with a tour
Pass me the hookah, my shirt is Medusa
You look like a broke boy, you gon' need a tune up
Let me dance, I don't wanna go home
The club is closed and I'm out of gear
Let me dance, let me dance, let me dance
Let me dance, I don't wanna go home
The club is closed and I'm out of gear
Let me dance, let me dance, let me dance
Oh, oh, yeah
Let me dance, let me dance, let me dance
