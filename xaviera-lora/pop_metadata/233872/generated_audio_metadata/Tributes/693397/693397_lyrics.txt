Let's call it a day, let's call it a day, let's call it day
Let's call it a day, let's call it a day, let's call it day
Let's call it a day, let's call in a day, let's call it day
Let's call it a day, let's call it a day, let's call it day
Let me know if it's worth the fight
Me and you argue all the time
The risk is to have a chance
My mind is knowing heart is yes
Let it go with the flow give it time
Why am I the only one to compromise
I can't even bother again
Tell me why I must pretend? (Let's call it a day)
(Let's call it a day)
(Let's call it a day)
Let's call it a day, let's call it a day, let's call it day
Let's call it a day, let's call it a day, let's call it day
Let's call it a day, let's call it a day, let's call it day
So many love songs I've written just wasted
All the times that I fought yeah we made it yeah
It's funny how the tables turn
For you this is a lesson learned
Isn't it funny how we said we'll last forever
Well forever's a lie
You know I'm right
Isn't it funny how we said we'd last forever
Well forever's a lie, you know I'm right
Let's call it a day
Let's call it a day
Let's call it a day
Let's call it a day
Let's call it a day
Let's call it a day
Let's call it a day
Let's call it a day
Let's call it a day
Let's call it a day, let's call it a day, let's call it day, oh yeah
