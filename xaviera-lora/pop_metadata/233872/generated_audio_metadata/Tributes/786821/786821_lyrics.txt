She was a warrior, can't you see
Every time she smiled
All her possibilities, yeah
She was born a rainbow child
Better man than fair-fitting gal
She was born to drive me wild
She was born a rainbow child
Have you seen the point of view?
It's not what she says
What she wants to do with you, yeah
She was born a rainbow child
Flying on a fox-head wild, yeah
Everything's reconciled
She was born a rainbow child
Higher on a mountain, forces in the brain
Changing courses
Would you save the wilderness every time she smiles
Faster, faster, don't be last
She was born a rainbow child
Better man than a fair-famed gal
She was bound to drive you wild
She was born a rainbow child
