These pictures of you are killing me
This seat to my right remains empty
This T-shirt of yours smells so sweet
These letters from you mean everything to me
All reasons why I can't walk away
To each other we're wasting what is
But who's to say it's the right way to live
So let's take this time to sing and dance
And we'll fall in love all over again
Oh, reasons why we can't walk away
I promised you that I wouldn't die
But the lights are out and here I lie
I'll look for you in that same old place
The humble can never fall from grace
Always wonder why you never walked away
In the end we'll both look down and we'll laugh about
All the worries insecurities and doubt
Then I'll take your hand, we'll go hand in hand
And there we'll stand on the edge
Where I'll kiss you for the first time
And the last time, and together
We'll walk away
