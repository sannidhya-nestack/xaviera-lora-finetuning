Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Is this what you wanted?
Or is it what you need?
I can't tell anymore
Never able to see
Hey, as loud as I can scream
No one is there
You know they won't remember me anymore
You know they won't remember me anymore
And all eyes there turn to you
To see what's next and what you're gonna do
What do they want, what could they want from me?
What could make you wanna watch me bleed?
And soon you're going to see that no one's really here
As loud as I can scream, no one is there
And soon you'll come to see that no one's really there
As loud as I can scream, no one is there
And soon you'll come to see that no one is really there
And I'm gonna find that I'm out of time, no one is there
