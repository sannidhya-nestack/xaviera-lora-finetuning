She call me a monster
I said well I need an accomplice
She said I'm gon' ride in that passenger seat like a Doberman or like a Dodge
She call me young Mercer
That's your baby young Gerber
That's your girl I'm merging
Our companies merged up
That's on my soul
These say ball, when the car trip pass
Better watch you toss, the young God
Call him Pentecost, nothing but plateau dust in my dogs
Call that the Iditarod
Most high call me the messiah, no lie realize I'm a light
Young real life live fast and we die
Young spend their motherfuckin' no exception
Headshot sleep no recollection
No evidence left for the testimony memory lapse
Case rested, may it rest in peace
Take it how you want it, I'ma give it to you, G-Straight
NML beats, say I'm not a human being
Ballin' like Kareem, sippin' on codeine
I lean with it, rock with it, got coke dreams
Wait one minute, gotta bring it back to it
Ball like I'm Pat Ewing, true religion on me dawg
Tell a hater bow down, take a shot from downtown
Wonder how the man do it
Racks on a Pro 2 set up to set it off
Every track get the ski mask treatment I kill it all
Every gotham seed thank any Jesus I come across
Get crucified by euphemisms and metaphors
Ain't no antidotes for antidotes
Poisonous bars are acid vats
Spilled on your pigment and melted off
Cuban licks from that Rayquan album
That's what I floss if you ain't built for that
I'll snap your back
