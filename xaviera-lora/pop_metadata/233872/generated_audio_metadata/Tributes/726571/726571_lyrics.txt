Rise up from your mourning
Dry your eyes so you can see
She ain't nothing, no, no, no, nothing like me
You proved yourself in this place
Now you can take yourself out
Mmm, you don't know
Know, know what love is all about
But it's alright now
she breaks you down
Where will you go?
When your heart calls out
Heartless lover
She leaves you broken, wounded inside
I'm your healer, I will mend what she has left behind
But it's alright now,'til she breaks you down
Where will you go
When your heart calls home
Calls home
You don't know what love is, baby, you don't know
You don't know what love is, baby, no, no, no
Baby, no, no, no
Baby, no, no, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
