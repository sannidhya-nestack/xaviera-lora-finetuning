What is love, what is war?
We played the game, what was it for?
Before her, the clouds formed, the doves flew
My heart yearned before her
The tides turned
I like my memories as they were
But now I live remembering her
I took a shelter underground
The rain and shells fell all around
Before her
The men crooned
The girls screamed
The babies cried
Before her
The peace died
I like my memories as they were
But now I live remembering her
We stood together
In trenches and behind the lines
We had it coming
But we never saw the sign
I took a love and took it down
We'd lie and listen to the sounds
Beside her our hands gripped
The heart swelled
The river flowed
Beside her
The fire raged
I like my memories as they were
But now I'll live remembering her
We stood together
In trenches and behind the lines
We had it coming
But we never saw the sign
It lit the sky, it shook the ground
And she was nowhere to be found
Without her
The air's still
The siren wails
The people stare
Without her
The stars gleam
The seeds root
The earth still turns
Without her
The bells ring
The rain falls
The herd burns without her
The oceans crash, the grass grows
The children play without her
Without her
I like my memories as they were (without her, without her)
But now I live (without her, without her)
Remembering her
(crow cawing)
