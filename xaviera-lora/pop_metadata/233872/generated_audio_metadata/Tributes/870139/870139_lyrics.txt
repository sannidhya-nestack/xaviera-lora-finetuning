Blanket me with warm and blinding sun
Follow footsteps in the sand with everyone
Ocean fades up, tracks away
Long otten where this has begun
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Blanket me with warm and blinding sun
Follow footsteps in the sand with everyone
Ocean fades our tracks away
Long otten where this has begun
Who, who, who, who
