The dice have rolled, my fortune's told
This well has just run dry
The wheel has spun, and one by one
My chances pass me by
And I can't stop falling down this time
I will never live again
I've nothing more to say
I will never love again
I've thrown it all away
I will never live again
I've nothing more to say
I will never love again
I've thrown it all away
I've thrown it all away
I've thrown it all away
