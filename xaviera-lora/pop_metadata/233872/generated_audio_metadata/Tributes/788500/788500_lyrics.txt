Beauty as wild as a pure mountain morning
Green eyes that glisten and hair spun from gold
A voice like a warm breeze whispering to me
Calling your name Prairie Rose
Wild prairie rose, where can I find you?
You're free as a tumbleweed
Wild prairie rose, where can I find you
And when will you come home to me?
too many days
I spent in the desert
Too many nights alone on the road
Wanting not having
Searching not finding
Searching for you prairie rose
Wild prairie rose, where can I find you?
You're free as a tumbleweed
Wild prairie rose, where can I find you
And when will you come home to me?
Someday I'll find you when I least expect it
Someday when I have abandoned all hope
that day comes I guess I'll go on
Dreaming of you, dreaming of you
Dreaming of you, prairie rose
Dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
Prairie Rose, prairie rose
