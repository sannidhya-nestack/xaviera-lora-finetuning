I'm waiting on the corner, outside there is sweet
Far away from you baby and I'm standing on my feet
I know you think you broke me but you barely made the rent
I got something in me baby that I never even spent
I got love, yeah yeah, I got love
Yeah, yeah, I'm waiting on the corner outside there is sweet
Far away from you baby and I'm standing on my feet
I know you think you broke me but you barely made the rent
I got something in me baby that I never even spent
I got love
Yeah, yeah, I got love
Yeah, yeah, I got love
Yeah, yeah
I got love, yeah, yeah
I got love, yeah, yeah
I got love, yeah, yeah, yeah
