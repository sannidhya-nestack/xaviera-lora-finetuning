I haven't the right to speak my heart about the way I feel inside
To understand the path we walk must truly be our own
Take your time and choose your steps with passion and precision
And know this day will never come again
Truly
Truly
Now you've seen the light, the day, the night
And which is truly there for you
An ancient view to help you through
To comfort and protect you
Take your time and choose your steps with passion and precision
And know this day will never come again
Truly
Truly
