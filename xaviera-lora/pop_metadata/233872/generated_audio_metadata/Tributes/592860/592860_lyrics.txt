The writing's on the wall
You can see your plane is dead
You stumble and you fall
And all your dreams they go away
Get up it's time for revolution
Get up it's time for revolution
Get up'cause the revolution's here
Get up'cause the revolution
Get up'cause the revolution
Get up'cause the revolution's here
It's a sticky situation
Never knowing who to trust
It's just infatuation
And social etiquette's a must
Get up, it's time for revolution (revolution)
Get up, it's time for revolution (revolution)
Get up'cause the revolution's here
Get up, it's a revolution
Get up, it's a revolution
Get up'cause the revolution's here
Get up it's time for revolution
Get up it's time for revolution
Get up it's the revolution
Get up it's the revolution
Get up it's the revolution
Get up it's the revolution
