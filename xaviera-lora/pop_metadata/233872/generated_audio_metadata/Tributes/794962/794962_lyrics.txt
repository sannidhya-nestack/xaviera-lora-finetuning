I've seen an eagle soar the sky
So I know what freedom is
Seen a worm become a butterfly
So I know what mystery is
And I've felt the pounding of the sea
So I know what power is
And I've seen a farmer plant a tree
So I know what faith is
I've waited for you all my life
So I know what patience is
And I've felt the sharp edge of a knife
So I know what pain is
And I've seen a man walk on the moon
So I know what wonder is
And I've seen a flower slowly bloom
So I know what life is
I've seen the winter turn to spring
So I know what beauty is
And I've heard the children laugh and sing
So I know what joy is
I've seen a mother nurse her child
So I know what love is
And I've seen a mother bury her child
So I know what sorrow is
Mmm, seen the sun begin to rise
So I know what hope is
I've looked into a baby's eyes
So I know what heaven is
And I've fought and killed men in a war
So I know what hell is
And I've lived through all these things and more
So I know (so I know)
So I know (so I know)
So I know (so I know)
So I know, so I know, and so I know what God is
What God is, yes I know
So I know what God is
