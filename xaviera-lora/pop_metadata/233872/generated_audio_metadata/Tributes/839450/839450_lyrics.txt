I can see the scars in your eyes, scars in your eyes
I can see the stars in your eyes
I can see the stars in your eyes
Shadows in your eyes
I can see the stars in your eyes
Stars in your eyes
I can see the stars in your eyes
Satellites
You could take me to the moon with my stars
I can see the stars in your eyes
Stars in your eyes
I can see the stars in your eyes
