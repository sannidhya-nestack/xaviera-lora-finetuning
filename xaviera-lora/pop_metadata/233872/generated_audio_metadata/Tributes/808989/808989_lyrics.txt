You ask if I still love you
And I'm taken by surprise
When I said my love was forever
Did you think I told a lie?
Do you think I changed my heart?
The way others change their mind?
If you feel that way, I'd like to say
I've made a tie that binds
If your eyes are the mirror of your heart
It's clear your heart has been through times when times were lean
And if your eyes are the mirror of your soul
You've got the most beautiful soul these eyes have ever seen
If the best in life is free
Then can someone tell me why
You're the only soul I've ever known
Who's willing to pay the price
I've seen lovers come and go
Through my heart's revolving door
But until you came along I never saw what love was for
And if your eyes are the mirror of your heart
It's clear your heart has been through times when times were lean
And if your eyes are the mirror of your soul
You've got the most beautiful soul these eyes have ever seen
You've got the most beautiful soul these eyes have ever seen
