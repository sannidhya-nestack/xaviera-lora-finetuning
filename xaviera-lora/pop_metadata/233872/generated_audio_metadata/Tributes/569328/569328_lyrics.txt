A thousand miles away
Still can't leave this place
You're still in my mind
This love has replaced home in a way
But I don't seem to mind
This impossible love will never stop
This impossible love, I'll never give up
This one love that keeps breaking my heart
This impossible love
Night after night
I let these ghosts of you haunt me
It's better than being alone
And so I say goodnight
Of goodbye
It's this love that keeps me going
This impossible love will never end
This impossible love, I'll never give up
This one love that keeps breaking my heart
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This impossible love is all I've got
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This impossible love is all I've got
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This impossible love will never stop
