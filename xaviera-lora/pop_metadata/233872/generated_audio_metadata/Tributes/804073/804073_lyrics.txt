Baby we can take this somewhere else, let's get out of here
Somewhere quiet we can be alone and let ourselves go
Maybe I can show you something you ain't never tried
We won't regret it, we won't et tonight
New player, you're my player tonight
Play it
Play it tonight
Maybe we can take this somewhere else, let's get out of here
Somewhere quiet, we can be alone and let ourselves go
Maybe I could show you something, you ain't never tried
We won't regret it, we won't et tonight
You're my player, you're my player tonight
Play it, play it tonight, tonight
