There's a smile on my face for the whole human race
And I owe it all to you
My blues are gone, I got a brand new song
And I owe it all to you
Ever since we met
I've been in your debt
No one else make me feel like you do
I owe it all to you
Now my life is on the feet and I'm back on my feet
And I owe it all to you
I found happiness, goodbye loneliness
And I owe it all to you
My rambling days are through
I found a love that's true
My days and nights are never ever through
And I owe it all to you
My ramblin' days are through
I found a love that's true
My days and nights are never ever through
And I owe it all to you
I owe it all to you
I owe it all to you
I owe it all to you
