A long time ago, on his way to Mexico
He first saw her at the grocery store
Was love at first sight, and try as he might
He couldn't get that woman off his mind
Let it shine, let it shine, walk that straight and narrow line
He let his heart be his guiding light
Let it shine shine shine
Let that love light shine
He kept that torch of love burning bright
As the years rolled by that love never died
So he travelled back to that border town
To find the love he knew and promised to be true
And they married in the fall of that year
Let it shine, let it shine
Walk that straight and narrow line
He let his heart be his guiding light
Let it shine, shine, shine
Let that love light shine
Keep that torch of love burning bright
Then came the day angels took her away
And he prayed to God to take him too
But in the darkest night he saw a shining light
And he knew what she wanted him to do
Let it shine, let it shine, walk that straight and narrow line
Let his heart be his guiding light
Let it shine, shine, shine, let that love light shine
Keep that torch of love burning bright
Shine, shine, shine, walk that straight and narrow line
He let his heart be his guiding light
Let it shine, shine, shine, let that love light shine
He kept that torch of love burning bright
He kept that torch of love burning bright
He kept that torch of love burning bright
