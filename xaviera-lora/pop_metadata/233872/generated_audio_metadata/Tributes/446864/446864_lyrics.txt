There's a tiny ribbon invisible to mankind
It ties us all together for all time
There'll be a rainbow soon to come
Its color so true, the magnificent one
Now I'm chasing behind the misty rain
I'll be ready when that sunshine comes again
Cause I believe and I've felt love before
And I know it can happen one time more
I tasted your love and I swallowed it whole
And it filled me up with all I need to know
And I held it tightly deep inside my soul
It's beautiful now where once it was hollow
I won't fear the coming of the sun
I'll stand tall along with everyone
Comes a time we all must be loved
Comes a time we give back more love
I tasted your love and I swallowed it whole
And it filled me up with all I need to know
And I held it tightly deep inside my soul
It's beautiful now where once it was hollow
I feel you up there smiling at me
I feel your message now I can see
I'm ready to move on I've opened my heart
It won't be long now for a brand new start
I've tasted your love and I swallowed it whole
And it filled me up with all I need to know
And I held it tightly deep inside my soul
It's beautiful now
Oh, it's beautiful now
Ooh, it's beautiful now
Where once it was hollow
Ooh
