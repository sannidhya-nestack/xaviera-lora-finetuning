The dice have rolled, my fortune's told
This well has just run dry
The wheel has spun, and one by one
My chances pass me by
And I can't stop falling down this time
I will never live again
I've nothing more to say
I will never love again
I've thrown it all away
My bets are laid
This bet is made
My luck has run its course
The clock has stopped
The battle's fought
My body's spent its force
And I don't want nothing anymore
I will never live again
I've nothing more to say
I will never love again
I've thrown it all away
And I can't stop falling down this time
I can't stop falling
And all I see is this last goodbye
I cry, I will never live again
I've nothing more to say
I will never love again
I've thrown it all away
I will never live again
I've nothing more to say
I will never love again
I've thrown it all away
I've thrown it all away
I've thrown it all away
