Woo-hoo!
Waves lap the beach, wind in the branches, fires cracklin'
On a steel moon tonight
Our distant parties playin' Bob Marley
Redemption
I don't rate the right
I was born bad, then I got worse
I met you, angel
I've seen the light
Here's to you and me
Crazy, leading the crazy
Here's to you and me
Oh, crazy, leading the crazy
Now put all your troubles in my right front pocket, baby
You know I do, you know I do, you know I do (You do right by you)
I was born bad, then I got worse'til I met you
Give me all your heartache too
Here's to you and me
Crazy, leading the crazy
Here's to you and me
