Don't let it get too late
Before you let her know
How much it means to you
You gotta let it show
Don't let her walk on by
You know the moment's right
Because you know you'll still be loving her tomorrow
Why don't you call her out
The way that lovers do
You've got much more to win
Than you could ever lose
So catch that falling star
Before it's out of sight
Because you know you'll still be loving her tomorrow
So tell her that you're always gonna love her
And tell her that you're always thinking of her
Just show her you're the one she can be sure of
You know you'll still be loving her tomorrow
Just take a chance on love
et that foolish pride
How will she ever know
If all you do is hide
No need to be afraid
Just tell her honestly
Because you know you'll still be loving her tomorrow
So tell her that you're always gonna love her
And tell her that you're always thinking of her
Just show her you're the one she can be sure of
You know you'll still be loving her tomorrow
So tell her that you're always gonna love her
And tell her that you're always thinking of her
Just for sure you're the one she can be sure of
You know you'll still be loving her tomorrow
