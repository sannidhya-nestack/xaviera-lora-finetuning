I wanna tell you about the city of angels
Hollywood sign, the sunset's true
I'm gonna take you where the women are hot
The liquor flows free where life is cheap
California, USA
My West Coast city is the place to be
If you got the money, you got the stuff
If you wanna make it, nothing's free
Long live LA
Long live LA
Long live LA
Long live LA
I wanna take you to a place where the getting's good
Let's kick it up there in Hollywood
We're gonna party in the city that never sleeps
We take no prisoners and pay for keeps
We're gonna roll this night and get our thrills
From the edge of the strip into the Hollywood hills
We're gonna build this city, no city of sin
We're rock and roll bricks, let the games begin
Long live LA, long live LA, long live LA, long live LA
Hollywood and the Sunset Strip
Long live L .A.! Long live L .A.!
Long live L .A.! Long live L-A
Long live LA! Long live LA! Long live LA! Long live L .A.!
