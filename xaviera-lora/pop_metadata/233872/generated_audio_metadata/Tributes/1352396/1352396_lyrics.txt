I'll ask you one more time
What you gonna do tonight
Are we going out tonight
We're standing on the edge of time
What you gonna say
Are we gonna let it pass on by
Better make up your mind
Before we let it slip away
Oh even if we get weary
Wanna lay our heads right down
We can watch the rerun movies
What you gonna do with the pot of started
The band is counting down
We're standing on the edge of time
I'll ask you one more time
What you gonna do tonight?
How we going out tonight
We're standing on the edge of time
What you gonna say
How we gonna let it pass on by
Better make up your mind
Before we let it slip away
Oh even if we get weary
Wanna lay our heads right down
We can watch the rerun movies
What you gonna do
The party started
The band is counting down
We're standing on the edge of time
What you gonna do
The party started
The band is counting down
We're standing on the edge of time
What you gonna do, the party's started
The band is counting down
We're standing on the edge of town
What you gonna do, the party's started
The band is counting down
We're standing on the edge of time
