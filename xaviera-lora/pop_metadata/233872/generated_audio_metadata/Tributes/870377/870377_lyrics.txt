This mountain's never ending
Just seems so much to push through
We'll inspire the message
We'll press on within
One foot before the other
One foot printed up tight
One reason left to conquer
These roads on which we climb (nanananananananananananananananananan)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
This mountain's never ending
Just seems so much to push through
Will inspire the message
We'll press on within
One foot before the other
One foot printed up tight
One reason left to conquer
These roads on which we climb (na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na na na na) (Na na na na na na)
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na, na na-na-na-na-na-Na
