Gotta work it out somehow
I've made too many promises
I won't go back on them, no
Girl, we gotta work it out right now
I swear I'll make you love again
I'll make you love again, and
If it's the last thing that I say, I
Make sure I say it the right way
If it's the last thing that I do, I
Make sure that I get through to you
Gotta work it out somehow
I've made too many promises
I won't go back on them, no
Girl, we gotta work it out right now
I swear that I'll make you love again
I'll make you love again, yeah
Gotta work it out somehow
I've made too many promises
I won't go back on them, no
Girl, we gotta work it out right now
I swear I'll make you love again
I'll make you love again and
If it's the last thing that I say I
Make sure I say it the right way
If it's the last thing that I do I
Make sure that I get through
And if it's the last thing that I say, I make sure I say it the right way
If it's the last thing that I do, I make sure that I get through to you
