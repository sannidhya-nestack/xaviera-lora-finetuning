The way she moves is so enchanting (oh-oh)
Keep the way she moves it's a warning
The way she moves (oh-oh)
A warning
A warning
The way she moves (the way I move)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The way she moves is so enchanting, oh-oh
It's the way she moves, it's a warning
The way she moves, oh-oh
A warning
A warning
The way she moves, the way I move
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
