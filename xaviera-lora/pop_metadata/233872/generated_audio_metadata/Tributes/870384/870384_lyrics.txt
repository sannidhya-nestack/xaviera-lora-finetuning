I don't want to spend this night alone
Cause your voice is in my head
And I'm lonely in this bed
Yeah I know
It's all on the line
I'll love me'til the end of time, yeah
Oh how I wish you'd just went home
Oh I know that we're not dead
Yeah I swear there's something left if you don't go
It's all on the line
I'll love me'til the end of time, yeah
It's all, it's the same
I'm in love
What's you do? It's always the same, I'm in love
What's you do? You do? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's always the same
I'm in love with what you do
It's always the same
I'm in love with what you do
It's always the same
I'm in love with what you do
It's always the same
I'm in love with what's YouTube, YouTube
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
