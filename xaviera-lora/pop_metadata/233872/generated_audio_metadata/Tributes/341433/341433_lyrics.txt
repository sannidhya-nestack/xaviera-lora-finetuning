Well the sun beats down on our faces and we're ready to go
With the rack top down and a beat from the radio
Pacific Coast Highway waits for us
We can't move slow
Oh I can hear California calling
On the wind that blows
When it's after dark, don't summer all year long (summer all year long)
Wake up the sun in the city and the roaming's going strong (going strong, going strong)
The girls don't get well much of the year (the boys can't wait just to find a deal)
To dance to the beat of summer all year long
Yeah, well everywhere you see'em, all the people from the other states
Yeah, they're flocking to the west coast, they're headed for the sunny gates
Ask the natives and they'll tell you it's the only place
The only place they'd choose
Just take a look and you'll see what makes it great
From San Diego to Santa Cruz
Anytime's a right time, summer all year long (summer all year long)
We got the sun and the sea and a romance going strong (going strong, going strong)
The girls are ten, twelve months into the year (the boys can't wait just to find a deal)
Dance to the beat of summer all year long
I can hear the echoes of summer every day now
You can't help but miss it when you're far away
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
In time, summer all year long, ooh
Goin' strong, goin' strong, ooh, ooh
Dance to the beat of summer all year long
When it doesn't matter, summer all year long (summer all year long)
We've got the sun and the sea in our garments, going strong (going strong, going strong)
To get us undressed, we have much of the year (the wise give way just to volunteer)
To dance to the beat of summer all year long
To dance to the beat of summer, oh yeah
