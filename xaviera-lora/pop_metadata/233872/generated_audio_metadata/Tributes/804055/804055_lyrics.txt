Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby what if you and I could switch up the rules
You could be the one who's waiting at the house alone
Every time you call I never pick up the phone
Oh oh oh oh
What you think of that, uh?
Baby what if you and I could switch up the rules
You could be the one who's waiting at the house alone
Every time you call I never pick up the phone
Don't think for a minute
A second that I couldn't be like that
Switch up the rules at the house alone
Pick up the phone
Don't think for a second that I couldn't be like that
Baby what if you and I could switch up the rules?
You could be the one who's waiting at the house alone
Every time you call, I never pick up the phone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, what you think I don't, uh?
Baby, what if you and I could switch up the roles?
You could be the one who's waiting at the house alone
Every time you call, I never pick up the phone
Don't think for a second that I couldn't be like that
Don't think for a second that I couldn't be like that
