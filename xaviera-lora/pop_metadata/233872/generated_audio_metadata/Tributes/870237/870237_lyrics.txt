Light skin, big butt, long weave
Dark skin, big butt, long weave
White girl, big butt, long weave
Everything big butt, long weave
She got her hair done, she got her nails did
I got the hottest chick up in this ish
She got her hair done, she got her nails did
I got the hottest chick up in this ish
Lap dance, move with the playlist
Rubber band banks, something bout to play with
Pay the full lick of the whip I came in
Making my chick, you ain't training
Just throw your body in the air
Wild out like no ones there
Drop bombs, atomic
Or you could slam like onyx
Light skin big butt long weave
Dark skin big butt long weave
White girl big butt long weave
Everything big butt long weave
She got her hair done she got her nails did
I got the hottest chick up in this ish
She got her hair done she got her nails did
I got the hottest chick up in this ish
I'm a hot boy, need a hot girl, make it drop girl
I'm so cold, sub-zero, chain rose gold
Boy we on, early morn
Still poppin' this champagne, it's a perfect storm
Self made, entrepreneur, won't see the whole thing
So she off for the tour, light skin big butt long weave
Dark skin big butt long weave
White girl big butt long weave
Everything big butt long weave
She got her hair done she got her nails did
I got the hottest chick up in this ish
She got her hair done she got her nails did
I got the hottest chick up in this ish
I got the hottest chick up in this ish
