I remember a time when nothing could please me
Now everything is fine now that you believe in me
You know I'd never lie to you
I'd never make you cry, no never
I'll be true to you, nobody but you
I look into my past
And see the girls I've loved before
None of them would last
Or being worth crying for
Love is not the same with you
I'll hang my head in shame if I let you down
I'll be true to you, nobody but you
There could never be another girl for me
I knew right from the start
I'd be giving my heart to you
I remember a time when nothing could please me
Now everything is fine now that you believe in me
You know I'd never lie to you
I'd never make you cry
No never I'll be true to you
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
