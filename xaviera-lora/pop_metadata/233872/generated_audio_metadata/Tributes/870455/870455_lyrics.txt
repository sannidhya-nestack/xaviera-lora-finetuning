Every time you leave
You break my heart to pieces
I need time to breathe
I let go of you and me
It wasn't all that easy
I need
Time to breathe, yes I can't hide the pain I need
Time to breathe, yes I can't hide the pain I need
Time to breathe, yes, yes
Every time you leave, you break my heart to pieces
I need time to breathe
I let go of you and me, it wasn't all that easy
I need time to breathe
Cause I
I can't hide the pain, I need time to breathe (time to breathe)
I can't hide the pain, I need time to breathe (time to breathe)
Every time you leave
You break my heart to pieces
I need time to breathe
I let go of you and me
It wasn't all that easy
I need time to breathe
