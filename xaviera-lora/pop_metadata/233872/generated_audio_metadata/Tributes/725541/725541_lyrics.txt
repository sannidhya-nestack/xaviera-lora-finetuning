Don't you go messing with Maria Brown
boy, she won't leave you right
Just when you think you've loved her and left
Her memory sneaks up in the night
Flaming red hair and emerald eyes
Pull you in and won't let go
A smile that warms you, oh and leave you cold
Yeah, you think you know her
But you don't, yeah
And you can't go back
No, you're never gonna love again
Yeah,'cause that wicked woman has got you in the form of her hand
Oh, wonder her spell
She'll pull you in
And once you've a love like that
You're never gonna love again
Lace and shadow and candlelight
Lay softly against her skin
And as she whispers all her lies
You'll want to reach for her in the end
Or you can't go back, no, you're never gonna love again
Yeah,'cause that wicked woman has got you in the form of her hand
Oh, wonder her spell
She'll pull you in
And once you've a love like that
You're never gonna love again
Late at night, you'll lie awake in bed
Stare at the pillow where she used to lay her head inside
You'll drift off to sleep
And she'll be there to hold you in your dreams
And you can't go back, no you're never gonna love
Yeah,'cause that wicked woman has got you in the palm of her hand
Under her spell she'll pull you in
And once you've a love like that, you're never gonna love again
Never gonna love
Never gonna love
Never gonna love
Never gonna love
Yeah
