See that girl, her name is Loreal
And she's the girl in all my dreams
She don't know (she don't know)
No she don't know (she don't know)
She don't know and I don't suppose she ever will
Her name's Louise but they call her Liz
I wanna be where Louise is
But she don't know (she don't know)
she don't know (she don't know)
She don't know and I don't suppose she ever will
Yes, she's sweet and I wanna be
Forever in her sweet company
But she don't know (she don't know)
Oh, she don't know (she don't know)
She don't know and I don't suppose she ever will
She don't know and I don't suppose she ever will
She don't know
