When I, I feel your heart beating
And all my pulse quickens just knowing that heart beats for me
The sun goes down and you can feel me coming
Oh I can take you away from the heart aching
Oh, I can't stop now
It's who I am
So turn around
And won't you take my hand
The choice is yours
So think it through
Just don't take too much time
But time might take you
Yeah, for you
We'll be forever
Yeah, forever a part of the family
This blood runs through
And they can try for all it's worth
And they can chase us around the world
But they're never gonna get in between you and me
Yeah, we can't stop now
It's who we are
We won't give in
Oh, no, we've come too far
Oh, they want our heads
So full of hate
At least we're not alone
Oh, is this storm the gates?
