I never realized how much you mean to me
I looked into your eyes but still I couldn't see
But now I see the light
I'll be with you tonight, I was blind
I was so blind
I couldn't see your love
Maybe you didn't know just what to say to me
Maybe you felt that it was best to set me free
But now I understand
Your flower in my hand
I was blind
I was so blind
I couldn't see your love
Now I can see you
I see there is love in your eyes
Now I can touch you
A feeling like this, I know that our love is alive
Oh, I was blind
I was so blind
I couldn't see your love
I was so blind
I couldn't see your love
