Penny from the wishing well of my past
Found in my pocket
So I found a puddle to the right side of the road I was on
Put it in the middle
I know you're gone
I know you're no longer here
And the sun will come up
But my heart wonders why
You're no longer here
Scratches on this esteemed chapel of my heart
No longer concern me
Thousand colors, the memories of my moments with you
There in the middle
I know you're gone
I know you're no longer here and
This too shall pass when my heart wonders why
It's missing you, tomorrow will be another day
And I can't give you nothing since you've gone your way
I know you're gone
I know you're no longer here and I'll keep marching up
But my heart wonders why
I'm missing you
Missing you
Missing you
Scratches on the Sistine Chapel of my heart no longer concern me
