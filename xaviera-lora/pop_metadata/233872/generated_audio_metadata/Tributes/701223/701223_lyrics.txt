If I could write a song it wouldn't matter
Words don't come easy to a thick headed like mine
If I could find the chords I'd find'em
Play'em like I feel'em
But my fingers are weak, they won't press the steel
But I'm on the road again, I'm on the road in blue
I thought I had the time in hand but I feel it slipping through
Whoever said I'm gonna change my mindset, I changed a time or two
You know everybody's got a line, I guess mine'll have to do
It's just another day with Rasputin
It's just another day
With the poison crown tryna burn me down
If this is as good as it gets then I better be getting on
Getting on
Because a life half lived ain't worth too much
And I've yet to pen a decent song for so long
But I'm on the road again, I'm on the road in blue
I thought I had the time in hand but I feel it slipping through
Whoever said I'm gonna change my mind said I'd change a time or two
You know everybody's got a line I guess mine'll have to do
It's just another day with Rasputin
It's just another day
With the poison crown tryna burn me down
It's just another day
That I rise spitting up
It's just another day
In the part of town that's a crumbling down boy
Ooh yeah yeah
And something must lift me
And take me far from hell
Someone, some deed, someone to
Something to lift me
Ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah
