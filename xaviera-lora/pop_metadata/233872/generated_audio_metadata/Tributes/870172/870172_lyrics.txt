Layin' on somebody to come through with me
Wouldn't work, make it work for me
No other bitch they got now on me
Take your time, no need to rush for me
How could you resist what I tried to give
How could you resist what I got to give?
Waiting on somebody to come through and fuck with me
Wouldn't work, make it work for me
No other bitch they got now on me
Take your time, no need to rush with me
How could you resist what I got to give?
How could you resist what I've got to give?
Be-go if I die, don't send go, be-be if I die, don't send go
Be-go if I die, don't send go, be-be if I die, don't send me
Be-go if I die, don't send go, be-be if I die, don't send go
Be-go if I die, don't send go, be-be if I die, don't send me
Be-go if I die, don't send go, be-be if I die, don't send go
Be-go if I die, don't send go, be-be if I die, don't send me
Be-go if I die, don't send go, be-be if I die, don't send go
Be-go if I die, don't send go, be-be if I die, don't send me
