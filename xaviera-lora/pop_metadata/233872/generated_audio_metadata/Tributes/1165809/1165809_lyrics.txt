The mood was set and the night was magic
Moon overhead and the night was magic
If you let her she could steal your heart away
She's on your mind early in the morning
Came upon you and without a warning
If you let her she could steal your heart away
Carolina she could steal your heart away
Carolina, she could steal your heart away
The mood was set and the night was magic
Moon overhead and the night was magic
If you let her she could steal your heart away
It came upon you and without a warning
She's on your mind early in the morning
If you let her she could steal your heart away
Carolina, she could steal your heart away
Oh, Carolina, she could steal your heart away
Oh, Carolina, she could steal your heart away
Oh, Carolina, she could steal your heart away
Carolina, she could steal your heart away
A Carolina, she could steal your heart away
