Gotta know what I'm fighting for
If I just leave you standing there at the door for you
Thank the jewels of your open arms
Test me, I dare you to test me baby
Test me, I dare you to test me baby
It kills me to say this
Sometimes I think you're more innocent than I am
It kills me to say this
I gotta know what I'm fighting for
Gotta know what I'm fighting for if I just
Leave you standing there at the door for it
Thank the jewels of your open arms
Test me, I dare you to test me baby (ah, ah, ah, ah)
Test me, I dare you to test me baby, ah (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Gotta know what I'm fighting for
If I just leave you standing there at the door for it
