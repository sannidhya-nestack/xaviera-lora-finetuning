We came to crank it up all night, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Girl got ass, she makes me feel like, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sometimes we don't feel like growing up and that's no doubt
So we party'til we die
Headstand with no hands with a fat sack of that hydro
Got me so lit while I rode it started moonwalking like Michael
We gone party all night get wasted
Turn up the music we don't care get stupid
We came to crank it up all night
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
So we party till we die
I'm feeling good right now bartender can you refill my glass
Somehow I feel like this drink ain't gone be as good as my last
Matter fact bring me that whole bottle you can put it all on my tab
I'm so fucked up can't drive I'm gone need you to call me a cab
We came to crank it up all night long
Girl got ass she makes me feel like
Sometimes we don't feel like growing up and that's no lie
So we party'til we die
Turn up out of this dream
