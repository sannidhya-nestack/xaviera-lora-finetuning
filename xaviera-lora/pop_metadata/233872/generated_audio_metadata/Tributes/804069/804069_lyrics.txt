I know how much you love it when I put my back into it (oh)
So watch me as I do it
I'm gonna have you singing like, "Oh"
Oh, oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Put your hands upon me (on me)
You know I'll rock that body (oh)
Send me over, be my soldier
I'm gonna have you singing like, "Oh," (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm gonna have you singin' like, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know how much you love it when I put my back into it
So watch me as I do it
I'm gonna have you singing like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Put your hands upon me, you know I rock that body, oh
Stand me over, be my soldier, I'm gonna have you singin' like, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm gonna have you singin' like, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh -oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm gonna have you singin' like, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
