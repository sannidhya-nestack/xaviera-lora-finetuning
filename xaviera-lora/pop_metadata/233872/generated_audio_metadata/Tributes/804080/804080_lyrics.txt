Ooh yeah, oh

It's hard when you feel like you'll never win, oh
But with you it makes it easy, I love the way that I'm made
You and me until the very end, oh

It's hard when you feel like you'll never win, oh
But with you it makes it easy, I love the way you love me
It's you and me until the very end, oh
I'll be on the same shit, working every day
It's hard when you feel like you'll never win
Oh, if you would make city, is that the way that I may?
You and me until the very end (very end)
