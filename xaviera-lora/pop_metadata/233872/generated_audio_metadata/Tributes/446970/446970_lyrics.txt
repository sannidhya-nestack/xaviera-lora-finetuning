Oh, oh, justice means you're sorry
Now I've locked the door
Cruelty carries penalties
Now you're just a whore
Funny how you're acting
As if you've got no pain
We both know the truth (we both know)
You're nothing if not vain
we have reached our final end
et that fence we tried to mend
You simply failed to see
Change is inside of me
I'll do just fine without you
Once when I was jilted
I took it to heart
Now I've learned my lesson
I won't fall apart
This time I'm the jilter
I decide what's next
Couldn't see it coming (couldn't see it)
Don't look so perplexed
we have reached our final end
et that fence we tried to mend
You simply failed to see
Change is inside of me
I'll do just fine without you
Having seen your soul, I now see how shallow
Your juvenile mind fills the test of time
we have reached our final end
et that fence we tried to mend
You simply failed to see
Changes inside of me
I'll do just fine without you
Cause we have reached our final end
et that fake sweet joint cement
You simply fail to see
Change is inside of me
I'll do just fine without you
