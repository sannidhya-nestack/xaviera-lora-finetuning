Funny how the time slips by without the nights we shared
Seems so long the memories fade like a half otten song
A half otten song
So you smiled today in the afternoon
When I walked in from the rain
It's those little things I notice now
That brings back hope again
It's just this dream of mine
That keeps me hanging on
It's just this dream of mine
That keeps me hanging on
Water under bridges
ive and et
Oh, it's so easy to waste your time
In a lifetime of regret
Maybe I should say goodbye
But your eyes met mine today
Tonight the way your hand touched mine
Made me wanna stay
It's just this dream of mine
That keeps me hanging on
It's just this dream of mine that keeps me hanging on
Just this dream of mine keeps me hanging on
It's just this dream of mine that keeps me hanging on
Just this dream of mine that keeps me hanging on
