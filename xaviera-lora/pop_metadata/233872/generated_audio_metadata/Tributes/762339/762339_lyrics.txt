I can feel the way you want to do
Wanna feel the groove that moves in you
We can get all down to right now
We can feel this funky funky town
Get it right
Get it right, do it right
Get it right, do it right, oh yeah
I wanna funk with you
Get it right, do it right
Get it right, do it right, oh yeah
I wanna funk with you
I wanna roll with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna roll with you
I wanna get with you
So, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Get it right, do it right, get it right, do it right, oh yeah
I wanna funk with you
Get it right, do it right
Get it right, do it right, oh yeah
I wanna funk with you
I can't feel the weight you want to do
Wanna feel the groove that moves in you
We can't get all down to writing down
We can't fit this on your funky tongue
Get it right
Get it right, do it right
Get it right, do it right, oh yeah
I wanna fuck with you
Get it back, do it right
Get it back, do it right, oh yeah
I wanna funk with you
Get it back, do it right
Get it back, do it right, oh yeah
I wanna funk with you
Get it back, do it right
Get it back, do it right, oh yeah
I wanna funk with you
