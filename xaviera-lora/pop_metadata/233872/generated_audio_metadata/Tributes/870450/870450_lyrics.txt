Endless, falling
Find a way to pass the days
Hopeless, drifting
Try to sleep the time away
Oh, yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Keep holding on
Stay, I'll be hanging on
Keep standing strong
Stay, I'll be hanging on
Got this feeling
I'll be there and you'll be late
Boundless dreaming
Shut my eyes and ruminate
Hang on
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Keep holding on
Stay, I'll be hanging on
Keep standing strong
Stay, I'll be hanging on
Eyes, eyes, eyes
Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
