Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Well, I saw you and my pupils came adjusted
Your stems gliding across the floor, I felt so flustered
Your grace, I'm over time
Oh man, you look so fine
I asked myself what kind of night would happen any otherwise
And reconciled my confidence to jump ahead
The other guy's time is now and we're both here
So let's skip right past delay
That's when I slide across the floor
And ask you darling for so much more
Please oh please come dance with me
Your eye was shocked as your peepers sparkled at me
You grabbed my arm turning separate into me
Glided on the dim lit floor to dance, dance, dance
The vibe we got although not sublue us right into ecstasy
A bustin' move for all to see
We broke the ice now all the rest joined us to dance, dance, dance
That's when I slide across the floor
And ask you darling for so much more
Please, oh please come dance with me
I guess this is our first date
I suppose it must be fate
Now let's try a slow dance
Fire up some romance
I guess there was no real reason to jitter up my nerves
The best of all my high school dreams are hidden in reserves
Now we are the couple to know
All it took was some courage to make it so
We waltzed into our dreams and slid right into love
We codified our steps as specified above
Held hands and saw it through
With goodness that we knew
That's when I slide across the floor
And ask you darling for so much more
Please oh please come dance with me
I was shoved as your peepers sparkled at me
You grabbed my arm turning separate into we
The vibe we caught all on our side and blew into ecstasy
Come dance, come dance, come dance
I guess this is our first date
We bust a move for all to see
That's when, that's when we might (That's when I slide across the floor)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (And ask you darling for so much more)
Ba-da-da-da-da-da please (Oh please, come dance with me)
Da-da-da-da-da-do-do-do-do (That's when I slide across the floor)
Da-da-da-da-da-Da (And ask you darling for so much more)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (Please, oh please, come dance with me)
Come dance with me, be mine
