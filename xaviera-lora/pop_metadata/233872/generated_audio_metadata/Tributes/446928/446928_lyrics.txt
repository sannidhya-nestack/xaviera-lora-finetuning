Laundry day hits the best
Lights and darks mixed with all the rest
Soap suds gather and wash real well
Makes my clothes smell just swell
And don't try to tell me
How white my shirt should be
Don't try to show me
How to fold my laundry
I'm doing just fine on my own
False excitement bites the dust
Quiet realism rules the day
Childhood wonder now all gone
Quiet solitude now in place
And don't try to tell me (don't try to tell me)
How white my shirt should be (how white my shirt should be)
Don't try to show me
How to fold my laundry
I'm doing just fine on my own
I'm doing just fine, fine on my own
Video Christmas just for you
Long distance love here it comes
Families uprooted, scattered wide
Gather together, Christmas more
False impressions running deep
Favorite gamesmanship, no escape
Find the wood pile, know your place
Earn some dignity, show true grace
Don't try to tell me
How white my shirt should be
Don't try to show me
How to fold my laundry
I'm doing just fine on my own
I'm doing just fine on my own
