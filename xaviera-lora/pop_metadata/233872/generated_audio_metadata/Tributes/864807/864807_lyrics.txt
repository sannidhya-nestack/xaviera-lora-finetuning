You better believe it
You better believe what I said
You're gonna deny it
You're gonna say it's in my head
You wanna try it
You wanna wrestle inside my head
Sink into the bottom
Spilling whiskey in my dirty bed
Gonna bang this drum loud
Bang it right against the side of your head
Feel the pressure mounting
Wishing you were like the walking dead
You better believe it
You better believe what I said
You're gonna deny it
You're gonna say it's in my head
You wanna try it
You wanna wrestle inside my head
Sink it to the bottom
Spilling whiskey in my dirty bed
You better believe it
You better believe what I said
You're gonna deny it
You're gonna say it's in my head
You wanna try it
You wanna rest inside my head
Sink into the bottom
Spillin' whiskey in my dirty bed
