The world is upside down, you'll make it out somehow
It'll work itself out, have faith for now
They're not listening to you, they'll act how they want to
No matter what you do, stay strong and true
Sending you away, and saying I can't stay
It's the only way
Darling it's okay
I'm here with you tonight
And you can hold me tight
Whisper goodnight
Time after time
Darling, we're on our own
Cast out, away we go
Sunshine, it'll be alright
Starry skies sing for you tonight
Wish you could understand
That I understand
Under the circumstance
This is for the best
Hate to say goodbye
So I'll just say goodnight
And every morning light
Remember these eyes
And if we're worlds away
Look to the sky and think
These stars never change
And just for you they sing
And to the very end
Until we meet again
Keep smiling my friend
Our journey begins
Darling, we're on our own
Cast out, away we go
Sunshine, it'll be alright
Starry skies, sing for you tonight
Darling, we're on our own
Cast out, away we go
Sunshine, it'll be alright
Starry skies, sing for you tonight
Darling, we're on our own
Sky skies, away we go
Starry skies, it'll be alright
Starry skies, sing for you tonight
