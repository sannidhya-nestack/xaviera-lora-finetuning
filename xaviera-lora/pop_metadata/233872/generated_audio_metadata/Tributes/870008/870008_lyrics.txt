I don't wanna fight, no I don't wanna lose this light
We can all be real and we can both survive
Don't you wanna know how many times that I've cried
We can all be real, no I don't wanna lose this light
No I don't wanna lose this life
No I don't wanna lose this life
No I don't wanna lose this life
No I don't wanna lose this life
I, I, wanna lose
I, I, I, I, wanna lose
I, I, I, I, wanna lose
I, I, now I don't wanna lose this life
I, I, I, wanna lose
I, I, I, I, wanna lose
I, I, I, I, wanna lose
I, I, I
I don't wanna fight, no I don't wanna lose this light
We can all be real and we can both survive
Don't you wanna know how many times that I've cried
We can all be real, no I don't wanna lose this light
No I don't wanna lose this light
No I don't wanna lose this light
No I don't wanna lose this light
No I don't wanna lose this light
I, I, wanna lose
I, I, I, I, wanna lose
I, I, I, I, wanna lose
I, I, now I don't wanna lose this light
I, I, I, wanna lose
I, I, I, I, wanna lose
I, I, I, I, wanna lose
I, I, now I don't wanna lose this light
