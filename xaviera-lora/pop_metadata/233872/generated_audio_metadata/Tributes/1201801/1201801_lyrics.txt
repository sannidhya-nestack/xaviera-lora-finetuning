Cactus flower in full bloom
Tumbleweed rose across the moon
Lord you know how bad I hurt
Send our lady of the desert
My heart beats like a tomb
A crucifix in an empty room
Though your grace I don't deserve
Send our lady of the desert
Send our lady of the desert
And I will not be afraid
Send our lady of the desert
Let her cool me in her shade
Some say they have seen her fly
A silhouette against the sky
So I sing this prayer to her
She's our lady of the desert
Send down Lady of the Desert
And she'll know just what to do
Send down Lady of the Desert
Send down Lady of the Desert
