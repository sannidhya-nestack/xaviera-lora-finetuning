I know
I know
Baby we can take this somewhere else let's get out of here
Somewhere quiet we can be alone and let ourselves go
Maybe I could show you something you ain't never tried
We won't regret it we won't et tonight
You're my player
You're my player tonight
Play it, play it, play it, play it, play it tonight, tonight
Maybe we can take this somewhere else
Let's get out of here
Somewhere quiet we can be alone and let ourselves go
Maybe I can show you something
You ain't never tried and we won't regret it
We won't et tonight
Oh player
You're my player tonight
Play it, play it tonight (tonight)
