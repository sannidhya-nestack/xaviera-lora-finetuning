When the sun shines all I see is black
And my troubled life goes through a nicotine attack
Well this talented million dollar smart ain't never paid my way
I still sing the songs baby
Even when I got nothing left to say
You talk about love
I ain't got a clue
I'm still here baby
Loving you
Your love has made me strong
No money, no gas, can't reach the end of the line
I ain't running out of love, I'm just running out of time
You talk about trouble, we've had it all
I've been to hell and back with the radio on
Your love has made me strong
Your love has made me strong
It seems I can't sustain no love
No matter what I do
I got all the tools mama
But I haven't got a clue
Your love has made me strong
Your love has made me strong
Yes it did, you loved me that way
Your love has made me strong
Aha
Your love has made me strong
Baby, baby, baby, your love has made me strong
