If I could make the perfect chick (damn) she would look like this (damn)
If I could make the perfect chick (damn) she would look like this (damn)
If I could make the perfect chick (damn)
She would look like this (damn)
If I could make the perfect chick (damn)
She would look like this (damn)
If I could make the perfect chick (damn)

If I could make the perfect chick (damn)

Damn
Damn
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn
It's them eyes, it's them eyes, it's them eyes
That ship sailed, that wars fought
Now we don't even seem alive
This way that you're dancing
Hips doing that damage
Don't wanna seem outlandish
And I know you speak Spanish
Necesito tu amor
Damn, damn
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn
What up doc or should I say hello nurse
Since the tiny tune never been below thirst
Like Gatorade never would've stayed a day
We keep the chicks half naked like it's Labor Day
She's a winter man, hot and all wintery
Looking like a bombshell, working on her summertime
If I could make the perfect chick, she would look like this
If I could make the perfect chick, she would look like this
If I could make the perfect chick, she would look like this
If I could make the perfect chick, she would look like this (damn)
If I could make the perfect chick, she would look like this (damn)
If I could make the perfect chick, she would look like this (damn)
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn
