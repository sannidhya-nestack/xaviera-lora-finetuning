If I could make the perfect chick (damn) she would look like this (damn)
If I could make the perfect chick (damn) she would look like this (damn)
If I could make the perfect chick (damn) She would look like this (damn)
If I could make the perfect chick (damn) She would look like this (damn)
If I could make the perfect chick (damn)
She would look like this (damn)
If I could make the perfect chick (damn)
She would look like this (damn)
Damn
Damn
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn
It's them eyes, it's them eyes, it's them eyes
That's hip shell, that's what's for it
Now we don't even seem alive
It's the way that you're dancing
Hips doing that damage
Don't wanna seem outlandish
And I know you speak Spanish (Sin Cinta, Camara)
Damn
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn
What up doc, or should I say hello nurse?
Since the tiny tune never's been below thirst
Like Gatorade never would've stayed a day
We keep the chicks half naked like it's Labor Day
She's a winter man, hot and all winterin'
Lookin' like a bombshell, workin' on a summertime
If I could make the perfect chick, she would look like this
If I could make the perfect chick, she would look like this
If I could make the perfect chick
She went up like this (damn)
If I could make the perfect chick (damn)
She went up like this (damn)
If I could make the perfect chick (damn)
She went up like this (damn)
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn
Necesito tu amor
