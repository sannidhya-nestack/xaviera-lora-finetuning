Oh, I am humble as I do crumble
Under the weight of letting to undertake
Yet I shall attempt with all my intent
To unlock the cage and release the furious rage
I'm the white knight warrior riding my horse forever
Swingin' my sword through the air
I'm the one night warrior
I'm the one night warrior
All that is never, only to endeavor
The strenuous flight, to see the light
With all due respect, I elect to hold his hand
Walk with him, in his forever land
I'm the white knight warrior, riding my horse forever
Swinging my sword through the air
I'm the one night warrior
I'm the one night warrior
As I slash my sword out at the unknown
Then I remount my horse after being thrown
I curse the evil woman just off the path
Wielding fallacy of torment and wrath
I'm the white knight warrior
White in my heart forever
Swinging my sword through the air
I'm the one night warrior
I'm the one night warrior
I'm the one night warrior
Riding my horse for a river
Swinging my sword through the air
I'm the one night warrior
I'm the one night warrior
