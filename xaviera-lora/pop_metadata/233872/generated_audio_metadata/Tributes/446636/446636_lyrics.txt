et about today
et about today and we'll go away
et about today
Tomorrow is another day
And the sun will shine again
My friend, is the rain all that bad?
And you never know what tomorrow will bring
And the sun will shine again
et about today
et about today
It will go away
et about today
Tomorrow is another day
And the sun will shine again, my friend
Is the rain all that bad?
And you'll never know
We'll never know what tomorrow might bring
And the sun will shine again
And the sun will shine again, my friend
Is the rain on that path
And you never know what tomorrow will bring
And the sun will shine again, again, again
Again
Again
