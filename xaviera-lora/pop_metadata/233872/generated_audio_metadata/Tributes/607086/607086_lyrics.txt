I've often thought
Where did it all start?
To find you again
And I know I can't make a mistake for you
Feeling it's right
Holding me tight
Wondering where it could all have come to an end for you
But me and you
Can talk to each other whenever we like and when we do
It should be better when all the words are for you
And you sing it about you
And should leave your house
Each to their own
You'll find me at home
When you're with me
Do you think of the next sunny day
For you
Just in your eyes
I know that sometime in the world is the right time
Think that I might
Gotta evolve in the long term for something better
You know you make me feel better
You know you make me feel better
You know you make me feel better
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ever been thought on?
Where did it all start?
I know, I think, I still, I think I still want you
I know, I feel, I think I still want you
I know, watch me move, I think I still want you, I know
I think I still want you
You know you make me feel better
You know you make me feel better
You know you make me feel better
