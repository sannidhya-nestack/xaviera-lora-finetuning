Money in my pocket, Jordans on my feet
Yak in my cup, get like me
Got money in my pocket, Jordans on my feet
Yak in my cup, get like me
It go boom boom bap, yeah we got it like that
Kick drum hit your whole body go crack
Baseline move take you off of the map
We ride crowds every time we react
Sticking out the chain, I'm so hot I might melt
Feeling boosted off the Henny, I'm feeling myself
I'm feeling heard too, leave your man back home
Your man won't trip if your man don't know
Money in my pocket
Next on the mic, left to go right
Step in the fight, I wreck'em in sight
And now it's time to move, no need to speak, yeah,'cause my rhymes are proof
I don't play these games they do, next time guns go off it's like Beirut
And I'm sitting on a throne next to Kanye but I'd rather be alone
Money in my pocket, Jordans on my feet
Yak in my cup, get like me
Got money in my pocket, Jordans on my feet
Yak in my cup, get like me
Get like me
Get like me, yeah!
