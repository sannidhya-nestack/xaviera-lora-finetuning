Hey baby, stop you fooling around
We got a nice day ahead
The life is calling you out
Put on your red shoes and dress up like the full sign
I know you are the girl of mine, just shine
I know you are the girl of mine, just shine
I know you are the girl of mine
Girl of mine
That's right baby
You are girl of mine
That's right
My girl
Keep on shining
