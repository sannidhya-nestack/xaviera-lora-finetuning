I'm in my own song
Give me some more till I've fallen down
Crawling around in the middle of the dance floor
I'm in my own song
Give me some more till I've fallen down
Crawling around in the middle of the dance floor
I'm in my own song
Give me some more till I've fallen down
Crawling around in the middle of the dance floor
I'm in my own song
Give me some more, till I'm falling down
Crawling around in the middle of the dance floor
I'm feeling good right now bartender can you refill my glass
Somehow I feel like this drink ain't gon be as good as my last
Matter fact bring me that whole bottle you could put it out on my tab
I'm so fucked up can't drive I'm gon need you to call me a cab
Give me something to sip on
There's nothing to drip on
Give me something to sip on
There's nothing to trip on
Give me something to sip on
There's nothing to trip on
Give me something to sip on
There's nothing to trip on
I'm in my own song
Give me some more until I've fallen down
Crawling around in the middle of the dance floor
I'm in my own song
Give me some more until I've fallen down
Crawling around in the middle of the dance floor
I'm in my own song
Give me some more, till I'm falling down
Crawling around, in the middle of the dance floor
I'm in my own song
Give me some more, till I'm falling down
Crawling around, in the middle of the dance floor
Give me something to sip on
There's nothing to trip on
Give me something to sip on
There's nothing to trip on
Give me something to sip on
There's nothing to trip on
Give me something to sip on
There's nothing to trip on
I'm in my own song
