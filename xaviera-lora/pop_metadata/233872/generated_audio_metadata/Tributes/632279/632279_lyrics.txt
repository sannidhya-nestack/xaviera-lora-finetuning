I don't know, I don't care
I feel us touch in the air, tonight
We were one, we are two
I see us touch in the stars, tonight
If it's there for you, it's there for me
If it's there for you, it's there for me
If it's there for you, it's there
We're almost there
We're almost there, we're almost there
We were one, we are two, I see us touching the stars tonight
If it's there for you, it's there for me
If it's there for you, it's there for me
If it's there for you
If it's there for you, it's there for me
If it's there for you, it's there for me
If it's there for you, it's there for me
If it's there for you, it's there for me
If it's there for you
