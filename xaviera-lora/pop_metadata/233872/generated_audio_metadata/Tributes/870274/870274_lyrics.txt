They don't wanna see you win
Them haters rather see you fall
But see I'm getting money man
And now I got em rooting for the underdog (yeah) (underdog) (underdog) (underdog) (underdog) (underdog)
Yeah I got em rooting for the underdog (yeah, yeah) (underdog) (underdog)
Underdog, that's right I got'em moving for the underdog
They don't wanna see you win
Them haters rather see you fall
But see I'm getting money man
And now I got'em moving for the underdog
Underdog, underdog, yeah I got'em moving for the underdog
Underdog, that's right I got him looking for the underdog
Joints in the gold chain living it up
Hand sagging gold grills living trill in the cutting
The dreams gotta follow mine
Swimming in the money squeeze me duck
Seeing dollar signs all I know is gotta grind
Pull up in a portion
Cisco rings just like Jordan
And Cisco rings yeah I'm sporting
Lil chick on me so take caution
We getting cash in so many amounts
Want you to scream and I want you to bounce
Bounce like a check in a checking account
Bounce like a check in a checking account
They don't wanna see you win
Them haters rather see you fall
But see I'm getting money man
And now I got em rooting for the underdog
I'm getting money baby, the haters can't understand it
I hear a lot of compliments, most of them underhanded
I don't take it for granted because I came from the bottom
I'm just happy that my name is mentioned with all these options
But when you're thinking of options
I'm the best that you got
Mr. Talent over height
Mr. Never to flop
If you need it I got it
I'll be bringing it to ya
I got the whole Metro booming like that new Drake and Future
