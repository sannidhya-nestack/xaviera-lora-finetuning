I could ask a million questions
That would leave me wanting more
That's why I let you do the talking
Maybe that's what talking's for
I do my best to learn to listen
Seems you have so much to say
If I connect with your position
I will learn so much that way
Oh, I could ask a million questions
I could ask a million questions
I could ask a million questions
How could I ask?
I could ask a million questions
