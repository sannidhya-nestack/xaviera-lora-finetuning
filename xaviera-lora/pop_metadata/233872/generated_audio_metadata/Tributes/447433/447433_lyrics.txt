Once upon a time at the Hepcat Lounge
A band from out of town came in to play
Hipsters over rocks for miles around
Thinking they could swing the night away
With pompadours and tats as they were looking fine
And all the cats and kittens stood to dance
But everything they played they played in double time
Those cats and kittens didn't stand a chance
Faster and faster they rocked the night away
Those rockabilly cops had nothin' nice to say
They couldn't stop the cats with the beat gone astray
When they shook up the town on psychabilly day
It was just about two minutes when the song was done
Then they played another like the last
Only one difference I could hear
Geesie saw me play for Swash Fast
They says, "Geesie, you thought we were a dance band?
We don't really mean to rag-a-diss
But rockin's much more fun when you're a double time
And we don't care if you can't dance to this"
Faster and faster they rocked the night away
Those rockabilly cops had nothing nice to say
They couldn't stop the cats with the beat goin' straight
When they shook up the town on that psychabilly day
At the end of the night they had a big fight while the jukebox played that song
Yeah right, the gear was destroyed, the band unemployed
They barely got away in the middle of the night
I can still remember at the counting line
They leaned out the window and they yelled
You haven't rocked until you've rocked a double time
So all you swinging cats can go to hell
Faster and faster they rock the night away
Those huckabilly cops had nothing else to say
They wouldn't stop the catch with the beat gone straight
Well they shook up the town on that psychabilly day
They shook up the town on that psychabilly day
