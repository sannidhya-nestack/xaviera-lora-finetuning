Do you remember the days
When life was young and bright
Thoughts were pure and simple
Everything felt right
Do you remember when we had nothing?
Do you remember when life was real?
Do you remember when money meant nothing?
Do you remember when we could feel?
Do you remember the days
When nothing mattered at all?
Laughing the days away
Even when we'd fall
Do you remember when we had nothing
Do you remember when we were genuine
Do you remember when life was just a game
Do you remember when we played for fun, everyone
Do you remember when we were nothing
Do you remember when we were nothing
Do you remember
When we were nothing
Do you remember when we were nothing
Do you remember when we were nothing
Do you remember when we were nothing
Do you remember
When we were nothing
Wish I could remember when we were nothing
