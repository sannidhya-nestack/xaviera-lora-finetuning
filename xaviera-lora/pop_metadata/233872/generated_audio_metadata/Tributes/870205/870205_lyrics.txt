Guns up, keep going even when the beats stop
Don't talk, keep going even when the beat stop
Last in the past going back to the future
Move so fast I'm an activist user
Two hoes and still I'm gone for the evening
Room full of dimes and they all so intriguing
Beat kicks,'bout to hit it with a remix
Uncut, we rock this, no re-rock
G shit, freedom might be increasing
Don't talk, keep going even when the beat stop
Now baby can you feel the space collapse
All around our bodies and perhaps
That's the reason
I'm so dizzy
Don't talk, keep going even when the beat's down (Don't talk, keep going)
Don't talk, keep going (Don't talk, keep going)
Don't talk, keep going (Don't talk)
Don't talk, keep going (Don't talk), don't talk, don't talk, don't talk, don't talk, don't talk
Gun tuck, keep going even when the beat stop
Baby can you feel the faith collapse
All around our bodies and perhaps
That's the reason I'm so dizzy
Gun tuck, gun tuck, gun tuck
Keep going even when the beat stop
Where to go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Where to go, no-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Go, go, go, go, don't talk, keep going even when the beats stop
Go, go, go, don't talk, keep going even when the beats stop
