These trees fall on their own
Summon birds don't eat alibis
Under this tree is sound
Under this tree I dive
You're my sweetest lie
You're my reason why
Will you be my valentine
Will you be my suicide
What you want you can't have
What you can have you don't want
Be happy that you don't have
All of those things you don't want
You're my sweetest lie
You're my reason why
Will you be my valentine?
Will you be my suicide?
Will you be my cancer
Will you be my cure
Will you be my poison
Will you be my floor
Will you be my heroin
Will you be my sound
Will you be my fire
Will you burn me down
Will you burn me down
Will you burn me down
Will you burn me down
Will you burn me down
Will you burn me down
Will you burn me down
Will you burn me down
