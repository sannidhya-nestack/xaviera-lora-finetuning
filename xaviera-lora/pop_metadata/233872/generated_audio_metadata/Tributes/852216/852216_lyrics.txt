So long, I'm gone, bye-bye
So long, I'm gone, don't cry
I'm goin' out but I'll be back
I miss you honey now that's a fact
So long, I'm gone, bye-bye
So long, I'm gone, it's late
So long, I'm gone, can't wait
I got to go baby I can't stay
I think about you every day
So long, I'm gone, bye bye
I don't want to hear you make a fuss
When I get aboard that greyhound bus
I'll get back when the weekend come
We'll be kissing and hugging won't that be fun
So long, I'm gone, bye bye
So long, I'm gone, don't cry
I'm going now but I'll be back
I miss you honey now that's a fact
So long, I'm gone, bye bye
I don't want to hear you make a fuss
When I get aboard that Greyhound bus
I'll get back when the weekend come
We'll be kissing and hugging, won't that be fun
I'm gone, so long, bye-bye
So long, I'm gone, don't cry
Going now, but I'll be back
I'll miss you, honey, well that's a fact
So long, I'm gone, bye-bye
Bye-bye
So long I've gone
Bye-bye
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
