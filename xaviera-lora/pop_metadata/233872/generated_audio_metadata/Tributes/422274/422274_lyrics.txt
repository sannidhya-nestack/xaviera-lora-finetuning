You are the wind, you are the rain
A flash of lightning, a sear of pain
You are the mountains and the wide open seas
A frozen iceberg, but you melted me
Wherever you go, whatever you do
Another broken heart
But it never hurts you
You are the man of ice
You are the man of ice
With a thrust in your veins
You live for danger, will I see you again?
You are the man of ice
You are the man of ice
With a chill in your heart
You'll die a hero and it tears me apart
A true man amongst men
Whilst women they fall
With just one look
They come to your call
And now that I love you
What future have I?
Is there time left for living?
Or will that love just die?
You're the man of ice
Whose soul has been chilled
When you break a heart
Does it give you a thrill?
You are the man
You're the man of ice
You are the man of ice
With a frost in his veins
You live for danger, will I see you again? (You are the man)
You're the man of ice
You are the man of ice
With a chill in your heart
You're a dying hero and it tears me apart
You are the man
