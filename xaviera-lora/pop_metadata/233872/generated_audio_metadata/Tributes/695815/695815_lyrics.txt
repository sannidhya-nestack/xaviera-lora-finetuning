I know you think you got it, you didn't face the fate
I fail you now with my self doubt
I know I ain't got no way out
I hit the sky while I'm still alive
It's murder now and murder is
Life in what was dust
Life in what was dust
Fuck a thousand stairs, crushing my skull
The bricks tell the tale of a blistered soul
That state of the pain building a game
I feel you now, with myself down
I know I ain't got no way out
I can't describe why I'm still alive
It's murder now, and murder is right
What was done, might be what was tried
Life in, I was dead
