I'm getting too close to you I see now
You know I'm falling
Getting too close to heartbreak now
You know I'm reeling
Stand away from me my love
I can't take it anymore
Stand away from me my love
I can't burn anymore
And I can't walk away from you my love
Can't stop admiring
And I can't walk away from you my love
Ill to sun though
It's shining bright
Killing bright
It's shining bright
Stand away
Stand away
Getting so I can't breathe anymore
You know I'm falling
Getting so I can't think anymore
You know I'm failing
Stand away from me, my love
I can't take it anymore
Stand away from me, my love
I can't burn anymore
I can't walk away from you, my love
Can't stop admiring
I can't walk away from you, my love
You're the sun and all, you're shining bright
Killing bright, you're shining bright
Stand away
Stand away
Stand away
you're shining bright
You're killing bright
Stand away
