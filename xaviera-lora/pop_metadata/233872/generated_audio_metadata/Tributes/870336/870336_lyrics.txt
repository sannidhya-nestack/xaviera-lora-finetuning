It's in the stories that we say
Like someone's waiting to be told
The act encompasses the play
We watch the scenes we live unfold
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's in the stories that we say
Like someone's waiting to be told
The act encompasses the play
We watch the scenes we live unfold
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
