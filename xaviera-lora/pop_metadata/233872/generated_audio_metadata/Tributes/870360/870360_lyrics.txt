We came to crank it up all night, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Girl got ass, she makes me feel like, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sometimes we don't feel like growing up and that's no lie
So we party'til we die
Headstand with no hands with a fat sack of that hydro
Got me so lit when I rolled it started moonwalking like Michael
We gone party all night get wasted turn up the music
We don't care get stupid
We came to crank it up all night uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Girl got ass she makes me feel like uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Sometimes we don't feel like growing up in that zone
So we party till we die
I'm feeling good right now bartender can you refill my glass
Somehow I feel like this drink ain't gone be as good as my last
Matter fact bring me that whole bottle you can put it all on my tab
I'm so fucked up can't drive I'm gone need you to call me a cab
We came to crank it up all night long
Girl got ass she makes me feel like
Sometimes we don't feel like growing up in that town
And so we party till we die
I'm a part of his dream (alright, alright)
