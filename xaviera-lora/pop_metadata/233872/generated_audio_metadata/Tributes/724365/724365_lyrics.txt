I took a long walk in the summertime
I see your face in the golden sky
All the dreams I have left behind
They fade away like a midnight
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
I see the snow moon rise
I see the blood in the sky
It's painted red with your lies
Well it comes as no surprise
Your lies, your lies, your lies, your lies, your lies
Your lies, your lies, your lies, your lies, your lies
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You love to hate me, hate me
You really love to hate me
You really love to hate me
Hate me, hate me, hate me
You really love to hate me
Hate me, hate me, hate me
You really love to hate me
