I left my heart in New Orleans a long time ago
I left my heart in New Orleans, now I'm going home
It was early one morning when I said goodbye
When I left New Orleans with tears in my eyes
Those days were so happy but now they've all gone
I'm going back to New Orleans that's where I belong
I left my heart in New Orleans
A long time ago
I left my heart in New Orleans
Now I'm going home
I'm going back to New Orleans
That's where I belong
I left my heart in New Orleans
A long time ago
I left my heart in New Orleans
Now I'm going home
