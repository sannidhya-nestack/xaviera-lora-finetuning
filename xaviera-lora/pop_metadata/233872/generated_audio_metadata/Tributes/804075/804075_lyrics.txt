Take me where you're going
Don't leave'cause I'm falling without you
I am lost
Take me where you're going
Don't leave'cause I'm falling
I don't wanna miss a thing
Take me where you're going, don't leave
I'm falling without you, I am lost
Take me where you're going, don't leave
I'm falling, I don't wanna miss a thing
You're the love of my life
And I want to be something of you
Take me where you're going, don't leave
I'm falling without you, I am lost
Take me where you're going, don't leave
I'm falling, I don't wanna miss a thing
Take me where you're going, don't leave
I'm falling without you, I am lost
Take me where you're going, don't leave
I'm falling, I don't wanna miss a thing
Kinda lost, kinda lost in here
