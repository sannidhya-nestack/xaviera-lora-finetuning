If I had my way, I'd be holding you tonight
If I had my way, I would always treat you right
If I had my way, I would say to you
Every emotion I feel is true
I would not be afraid if I had my way
On a moonless night I would take your hand in mine
And hold you close and promise you in time
If I had my way, my love we would be together forever just you and me
I would not hesitate if I had my way
Something inside me is calling me straight to your heart
Nothing can stop me or keep us apart
If I had my way
Something inside me is calling me straight to your heart
Nothing can stop me
Or keep us apart
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
