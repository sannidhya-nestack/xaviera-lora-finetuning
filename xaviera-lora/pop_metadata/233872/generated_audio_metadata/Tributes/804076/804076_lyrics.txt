Ooh yeah, oh, I'd be on the same
Workin' every day, it's hard when you feel like you'll never win, oh
But with you it makes it easy, love the way you love me
It's you and me until the very end, oh, I'd be on the same
Working every day is hard when you feel like you'll never win, oh-oh
And when you're with me, steady is the wheel
I'll marry you and me until the very end, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Oh, I'd be on the same shit
Working everyday, it's hard when you feel like you'll never win
Oh, but with you it makes it easy
Say you love the way you love me, it's you and me until the very end
Oh, I'd be on the same shit
Working every day is hard when you feel like you'll never win, oh oh
And when you're with me steady is that the way that I'll marry you and me until the very end, very end, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow
