I'm coming up for more air, baby
And then I'll go back down, get wet
I'm coming up for more air, baby
Just breathe,'cause I'm about to dive in, baby
And then I'll go back down, get wet
I'm coming up for more air, baby
Just breathe,'cause I'm about to dive in
'Cause I'm about to dive in (dive in, dive in)
I'm coming up for more air, baby
And then I'll go back down, get wet
I'm coming up for more air, baby
Just breathe,'cause I'm about to dive in, baby
And then I'll go back down, get wet
I'm coming up for more air, baby
Just breathe,'cause I'm about to dive in
'Cause I'm about to dive in (dive in, dive in)
I'm about to dive in (dive in, dive in)
