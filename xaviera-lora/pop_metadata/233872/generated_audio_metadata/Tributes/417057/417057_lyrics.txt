Gotta get out of Texas, gotta get out of here
Or somewhere where another man, another man treatin' up there
Or in back of Mississippi, that's where I'm gonna be
Go back west of Zip-Zoo, another man I'll be
The top of Louisiana, where the kitchen girls are good to be
The top of Louisiana, where the kitchen girls are good to be
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, huh

You know what that's?
Putting me where?
Putting a little marijuana in my head?
Got to get out of here
Huh
Hey
Huh
Baby, really hard, really, really hard, really, really, really hard
Hey, hey, hey
I ain't got no chances, I ain't got it
Go somewhere where another man, another man, may be, yeah, hmm, hmm
Goin' back to Mississippi, when I'm free, baby
Goin' back to Mississippi, that's where I can go off to, hmm
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
