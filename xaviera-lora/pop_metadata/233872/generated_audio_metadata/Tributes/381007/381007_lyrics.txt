There's a place out there I should be going
There's a life out there I should be living
But I'm here instead, lying in my bed dreaming of a life I should know
There's a girl out there I should be loving
On a starry night with the moonlight glowing
I've got to get out of my head, wake up, I've got an old life
I want to run wild and free, go climb a tree, or be where it's at
I want
To do that
Sail on a yacht
Be a big shot
I'm tired of just dreaming
I bid you adieu
I'm off to Peru
I hear it's quite nice
No need to think twice
I'm leaving today
There's no need to stay
I don't wanna be here anymore
A-si-ba-du-ba-di
I've got to get out of my head, wake up
I've got an old life to shed
I don't wanna be here anymore
I want to run wild and free, go climb a tree
I'll be where it's at, I want to do that
Sail on a yacht, be a big shot
I'm tired of just dreaming
I bid you adieu, I'm off to Peru
I hear it's quite nice, no need to think twice
I'm leaving today, there's no need to stay
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here
No, I don't wanna be here anymore
The seed that you believe
