Well I saw you when my peepholes came unjusted
Your stems gliding across the floor I felt so flustered
Your grace on overtime, oh man you look so fine
I ask myself what kind of night will happen any otherwise
And I reconcile my confidence to jump ahead of the other guys
The time is now and we're both here, so let's skip right past delay
That's when I slide across the floor
And ask you darling for so much more
Please, oh please come dance with me
And I was shocked as your peepers sparkled at me
You grabbed my arm, turning separate into we
We glided on the dim lit floor to dance, dance, dance, dance
The vibe we caught, although not sought, blew us right into ecstasy
We bust a move for all to see
We broke the ice, now all the rest join us to dance, dance, dance
That's when I slide across the floor
And ask you, darling, for so much more
Please, oh please, come dance with me
I guess this is our first date
I suppose it must be fate
Now let's try a slow dance
Fire up some romance
I guess there was no real reason to jitter up my nerves
The best of all my high school dreams were hidden in reserves
Now we are the couple of the know
And all it took was some courage to make it so
We waltzed into our dreams and slid right into love
And codified our steps
As specified above
Held hands and saw through
With goodness that we knew
That's when I slide across the floor
And ask you, darling, for so much more
So please, oh please, come dance with me
Yeah, yeah
And I was shocked as your peepers sparkled at me
You grabbed my arm, turning separate into we
The vibe we caught, although not sought, blew into ecstasy
Come dance, come dance, come dance, I guess this is our first date
We bust a move for all to see
That's when, that's when, be mine
Ooh, la-na-na-na-na-na-da-da-da-da-da-ba
Da-da-da-da-da
