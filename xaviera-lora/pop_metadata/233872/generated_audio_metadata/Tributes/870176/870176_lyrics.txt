I don't wanna feel your fingertips on my skin
I don't wanna feel your touch if it's empty again
I don't wanna feel your cold, cold hands
I don't wanna spend another night alone again
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh -ooh
I don't wanna feel your touch if it's empty again
I don't wanna feel your touch, I don't wanna feel your touch
I don't wanna feel your fingertips on my skin
I don't wanna feel your touch if it's empty again
I don't wanna feel your cold cold hands
I don't wanna spend another night alone again
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I don't wanna feel your touch
I don't wanna feel your touch, I don't wanna feel your fingertips on my skin
