There's a place I want to take you
With gardens and a zoo
It's a wondrous place we call Tilden Park
There's the Apple Blossom Fair
The smell of cotton candy in the air
It's a magical place we call Tilden Park
A Tilden Park you see is a place where lovers can be
Holding hands and skipping stones all day
Walking hand in hand past the big grass bend
A wonderful way to spend your day
Tilden Park, you see, is a place where lovers can be
Holding hands and skipping stones all day
Strolling to the lake before it gets too late
Where they go to steal a kiss
There's a place I want to take you
With gardens and a zoo
It's a wonderous place we call Childen Park
There's the Apple Blossom Fair
The smell of cotton candies in the air
It's a magical place we call Childen Park
