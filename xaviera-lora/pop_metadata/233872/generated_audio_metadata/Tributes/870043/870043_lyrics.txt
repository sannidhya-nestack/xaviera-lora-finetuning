Every time I need a rescue
Hanging on the verge of breakdown
Waiting for a touch to save the day
Even though I try to replace you
Loneliness makes me break down
Nothing could really take your place
Ah, nothing could really take your place
Ah, nothing could, nothing could
Every time I need a rescue
Hanging on the verge of breakdown
Waiting for a touch to save the day
Even though I try to replace you
Loneliness makes me break down
Nothing could really take your place
Ah, nothing could really take your place
Ah, nothing could, nothing could
