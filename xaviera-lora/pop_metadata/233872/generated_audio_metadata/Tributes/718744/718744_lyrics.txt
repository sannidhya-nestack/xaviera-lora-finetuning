I'm gonna sing this song for you
It's just the way I feel about you
I'm gonna write this song for you
It's just the way I dream about you
I dream about you (La la la la la)
Caught in your love, high on the branches, my kite is caught in your love, caught in your love, high on the branches, my kite is caught in your love
Gonna play this song for you (la-la-la-la-la-la)
It's just the way things fall around here (la-la-la-la-la-la)
I'm gonna live this song for you (la-la-la-la-la-la)
It's just the way I pray to you (la-la-la-la-la-la)
I pray to you (la-la-la-la-la-la)
Caught in your love
High on the branches
My kite is
Caught in your love
Caught in your love
High on the branches
My kite is
Caught in your love
I'm looking for truth, my heart is caught in you (my heart is caught in you)
I'm looking for truth, my heart is caught in you (my heart is caught in you)
