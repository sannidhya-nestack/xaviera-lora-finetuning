Is this the way I think I'm lost
I think something should happen
Maybe a crossroads to cross
Ever been this way before
It seems so strange
Not like I thought it'd be
I need a landmark to see
A fool to a woman cast a spell on me
What should I be looking for
And what should I do
Should I try to light a stick of fire
Or should I light a fire on the moon
Voodoo woman, I'm in love with you
What should I be looking for
And what should I do
Should I try to signify
Voodoo, voodoo, woman, do you care for me
Voodoo woman
Who the woman?
Who the woman?
Who the woman?
