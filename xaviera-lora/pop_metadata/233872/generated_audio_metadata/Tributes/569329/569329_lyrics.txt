Dear brother of mine
I fear tonight we may die
This could be paradise
Maybe in another life
Dear brother don't you cry
We can change our stars tonight
And if we make it out alive
I promise you a better life
And we're leaving, we're leaving all of this behind
And I'll say, I'll see you on the other side
That I want you to know
It's not your fault, mom's a mess
And thanks for staying by our side
But it's time to go, here comes the light
And we're late
We're leaving all of this behind
It'll sit
I'll see you on the other side
Tonight we say goodbye
Tonight we say goodbye
Tonight we say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
And we're late
We're leaving all of this behind
And I'll say
I'll see you on the other side
And we're late
We're leaving all of this behind
It'll say
I'll see you on the other side
Tonight we say goodbye
Tonight we say goodbye
If we make it out alive
I promise you a better life
