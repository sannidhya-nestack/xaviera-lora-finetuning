And every time
Change, change, change
People of vision
Change, change, change
Lead nations into the future
By their understanding
A vision that people are only one race
That the world is a jewel in a heavenly place
That kindness builds nations that trade with good grace
That love transcends all pettiness and pain
In every time, change, change, change
Keep up the vision, change, change, change
Lead nations into the future by their understanding
That poverty is only the face of neglect
And that it continues till we learn to respect
That the guns of some nations choose the men they elect
We see so much suffering
And fail to connect
And every time, change, change, change
People of vision, change, change, change
Lead nations into the future by their understanding
That people should have many strings to their bow
That learning gives people the power to grow
That dignity lives in the things that you know
And that you shall reap from the seeds that you sow
In every time change change change
People of vision change change change
Lead nations into the future
By their understanding
In every time
Change change change
People of vision
Change change change
Lead nations into the future
By their understanding
