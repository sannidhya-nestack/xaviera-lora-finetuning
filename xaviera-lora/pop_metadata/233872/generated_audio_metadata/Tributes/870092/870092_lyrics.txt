Where are you?
Where are you?
Instead of still feeling the beats they're living to
Not just their hearts and moves, they've got their eyes on you
From people all around, they've summoned me
I'll have no memories, I wonder who you'll be
My life
And then I still feel the beats they're living to
Not just their hearts and moves, they've got their eyes on you
Those people all around, they've summoned me
I have no memories, I wonder who you'll be
I, I
I, I
