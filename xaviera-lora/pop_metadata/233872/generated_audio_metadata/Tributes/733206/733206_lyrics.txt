Oh, yeah
My friends read all about it
You're in the news
My friends read all about it
Got nothing to lose
Oh there's a rumor going round this one-horse town
That's Lise you spoke to wrote it all down
Told you a story, ooh, a big mistake
Got a juicy feeling now and I said on that cane
My friends read all about it
You're in the news, my friends
Read all about it, girl
Got nothing to lose
Oh, it happens all the time when the sun goes down
Crazy drunken parties on the one-horse town
Readers need a scandal, he taps the phone
Papers got a deadline, dog eats a bone
My friends read all about it
You're in the news, my friend
Read all about it, girl
Got nothing to lose
Didn't do it, it wasn't me
I'm so drunk I couldn't even see
Didn't know it, I wish I had
Need a scandal, well you got the right man
Roll up, roll up, read all about it, girl
Oh yeah
No smoke without fire
But that ain't true
You know it ain't true babe
You know it ain't true
My friends read all about it
You're in the news
My friends read all about it
Got nothing to lose, my friends
Read all about it, all about it
You're in the news, my friends
Read all about it, all about it
Got nothing to lose
