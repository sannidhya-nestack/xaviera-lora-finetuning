Wealthy tramps and landlords (ha)
Come to show the youth them how to trot (hear this)
Too much gun man (who should've stopped)
Me a go run dem, run dem, run out of the way
A go run the GTA, mash up the M1
Run dem bun dem, run out a town dem, just a kill off the youths dem inna we island
Run dem bun dem, run out a town dem
We a go run deh 4 ,5 mash up deh M1
Run dem bun dem, run out a town dem
Just a kill off the youths dem inna we island
You see de boi, him kill ten
Then make me el kill off another one
Because him find a way out to be the system
Kill all the witness dem
You think it right, when they want fight
One for him but instead of fist and fight
Next thing you know him take another life
Then want ball out Jesus Christ
Me a go run dem, run dem, run out of the way
A go run the EK, mash up the M1, run them
Run dem bun dem, run out a tun, dem dos a kill off the youths dem inna we highland
Run dem bun dem, run out a tun, we a go run deh four five mash up the M1
Run dem bun dem, run out a tun, dem dos a kill off the youths dem inna we highland
Long time we tell them stop from bust them gun

See Jesus Christ is a work we set and
Be to wrong cannot allow the ghetto where we come from
