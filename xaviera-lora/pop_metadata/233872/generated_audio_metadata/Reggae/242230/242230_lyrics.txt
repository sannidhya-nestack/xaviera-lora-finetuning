Alcohol, what a phenomenon
It makes no sense at all
Let's talk about alcohol
Alcohol makes me feel ten feet tall
When I get insecure, I reach for alcohol
And alcohol makes all my shirts too small
Cause I grow huge muscles when I drink alcohol
Ain't it funny how some things they change
But some things they stay the same
We've always got one little thing that we can't blame
Alcohol makes economies prosper
And I work at a bar because of alcohol
And alcohol is behind every single war
It is one guaranteed pitfall of all men who are in power
Ain't it funny how some things they change, oh
But some things always stay the same
We've always got one little thing that we can't blame
Alcohol is irresponsible
I make late night phone calls
When I drink alcohol
And alcohol is horrible for birth control
Don't et you were probably born
Because of alcohol
Alcohol
Sometimes fills me with love
Sometimes I can't get it off
Because of alcohol
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Alcohol
It's all your fault alcohol
It's all your fault alcohol
But I love you alcohol
