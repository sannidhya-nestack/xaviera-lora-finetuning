If you wake up in the morning
With an invincible sensation inside
Your heart is just giving you a warning
It's a feeling impossible to hide
So let it loose, release the power in you
There's no excuse for not doing the best you can do
Let it loose
Whatever you choose
Everyday we can make any dream come true
Let it loose
Yeah, let it loose
No mountain is too high
If you have the courage to climb
The view will be everything you've ever dreamed
When you're everything you can be, yeah
So let it loose
Release the power in you
There's no excuse
For not doing the best you can do
Let it loose
Whatever you choose
Everyday we can make any dream come true
Let it loose, yeah let it loose
No mountain is too high
If you have the courage to climb
The view will be everything you've ever dreamed
When you're everything you can be
So let it loose
Release the power in you
There's no excuse
For not doing the best you can do
Let it loose
Whatever you choose
Everyday we can make any dream come true
Let it loose, yeah, yeah, let it loose
Everyone let it loose, loose, come on, let it loose
