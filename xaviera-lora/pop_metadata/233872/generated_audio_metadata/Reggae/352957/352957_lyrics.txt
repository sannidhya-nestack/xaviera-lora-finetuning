All of you and none of me is not the way you ought to be
You never give in once in a while
But no one lets you get your way in all the world
Instead of pay you stop and carry on like a child
You need to be somewhere
No you don't even care
Destroying everything in your way
It's more important that you run out play
Wretched, rude, and feeling low-conceited
And you're proud to know you're wine and shed is iron and steel
The hands and time are on your side together
We should all about change our temperaments for what you feel
Enough to stuff your drawers
You've got enough but you want more
Selfishness is easy to see
You're trying to walk away with what isn't free
Do you know what's all about me? (It's all about)
To you it's all about me, it's all about
Treat me bad it isn't funny till the day you leave the money that everything's okay
But a temporary change of pace is not enough it won't erase the damage you did yesterday
Without a helping hand
Someday you'll understand
You never had it all that bad
You find a missing love that you once had
To you it's all about me (it's all about)
To you it's all about me (it's all about)
To you it's all about me (it's all about)
Oh, to you it's all about me (it's all about)
To you it's all about
Do you really think you're the only one in this world?
Do you really think you're the only one in this world?
Do you really think you're the only one in this world?
Do you really think you're the only one in this world?
To you it's all about me
All of you and none of me is not the way you ought to be
You never give in once in a while
But oh unless you get your way then all the world is at a bay
You stop and carry on like a child
You need to be somewhere
No you don't even care
Destroying everything in your way
It's more important that you run out of lead
To you it's all about me (it's all about)
To you it's all about me (it's all about)
To you it's all about me (it's all about)
Oh to you it's all about me (it's all about)
To you it's all about me
