Walking on my journeys away
I spot a young traveller
Wise though very young
I could tell with himself he was one
I said I'm weary to my bones
Running much too long
He said the light within your reach
That's the light of eternal peace
Watch out (messin' with big boy) you're messin' with big boy now
Watch out, you're messin' with big boy now
Only your love can help you find your way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
And he said deep within yourself
Lies an endless living well
Inward you must turn
For you still have so much to learn
Cast away the tears of a lifetime (cast away)
Cast away fear of what you may find
You can walk in the sun, everyone
Get back in touch with the child (get back in touch with the child)
Watch out (messin' with big boy)
Messin' with big boy now, watch out
You're messing with big boy now
Only your love can help you find your way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch out (messin' with big boy) you're messin' with big boy now
Watch out (watch out) you're messin' with big boy now
Only your love can help you find your way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
There is a way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're messing, you're messing with the big boy
