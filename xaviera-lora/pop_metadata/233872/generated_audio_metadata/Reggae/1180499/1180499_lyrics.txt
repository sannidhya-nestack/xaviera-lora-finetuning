I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Lord
Oh, oh yeah
Some people around you
Can sometimes be so distracting
You're trying so hard to make life right
They're throwing you off (throwing you off)
You see them everyday (see them everyday)
Smiling with you
But if you could only know
The hatred they have for you
Don't let bad vibes keep you down
Don't let the vibe discourage you
Just keep doing your thing right
And Jah will surely reward you
Because of the vibe (vibes, vibes, vibes)
You don't wanna stick around
You only feel like giving up
But that is what they would like to see
They would enjoy nothing better
Than to see you be a failure (watch this)
And then their wish would come true
And that would be bad for you
Don't let bad vibes keep you down
Don't let the vibe discourage you
Just keep doing your thing right
And I will surely reward you
Don't let bad vibes keep you down
Don't let the vibe destroy you
Just keep doing your thing right
And Jah will surely reward you
They make sure every time to let Jah be your guide
And no weapon form against you shall conquer you
They shall be tired to see you moving forward
Succeeding in your endeavors
And they will see that they can't stop you
They'll see that they can't hurt you
Don't let bad vibes keep you down
Don't let the bad destroy you
Just keep doing your thing right
And Jah will surely reward you
Don't let the bad vibes keep you down
Don't let the bad destroy you
Don't let the lies keep you down, keep doing what's right (you're doing right, you're doing right)
And you'll be right, surely we're all you
