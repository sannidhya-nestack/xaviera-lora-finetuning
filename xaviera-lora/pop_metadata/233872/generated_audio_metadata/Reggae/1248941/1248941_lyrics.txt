She wanna be a pop star
Crowd screamin' loud
Millions of fans
She gotta make them proud
Lights shining bright on the stage so brand
She takes the mic with power in her hands
Dreams in her heart since she was just a child
Now it's coming true, she's running wild
Shining like the sun, dancing in the night
Every note she sings, feels so right
From the streets to the stage, she's breaking every cage
With rhythm in her soul, she's on a roll
Hands in the air
Echoes of a song
In the beat of the drums
She knows she belongs
Lights shining bright on the stage so bright
She takes the mic with power in her hands
Dreams in her heart since she was just a child
Now it's coming true, she's running wild
Shining like the sun
Dancing in the night
Every note she sings
Feels so right
From the streets to the stage
She's breaking every cage
With rhythm in her soul
She's on a roll
Hands in the air
It's in the air
Echoes of a song
Echoes of a song
The beat of the drums
The beat of the drums
Where she belongs
From the streets to the stage
She's breaking every cage
Rhythm in her soul
She's on a roll
Imagine in the air
That the echoes of a song
The beat and the beat of the drums
She goes, she's sleeping long
