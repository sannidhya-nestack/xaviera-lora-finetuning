As we make our way, as we attempt to make another day
It seems to me we are slowly, we're slowly losing ground
Corruption infesting our country and bribery ruining our town
But what affects me most is to see
Our tradition lost
How much a little loss can cost
A little loss can cost, cost, yeah
But we are but one small town compared
To the great cities that they tie us on
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We are but little people
Too little to be trampled on
Oh, oh, oh
As we awaken let us talk
Let us talk, let us talk, let us talk
For it's our land on which we walk
On which we walk, we walk, we walk
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
On which we wander
All our, we are but one small town
Compared to the great cities that they tie us down
Oh, oh, oh
And we are one little people
Too little to be trampled on
Oh oh oh oh oh
We have travelled the span of years
With no direction, no, no, no
We've shown so many, so little and to others
Too much affection, yeah, yeah
Why do we strive for so much material fantasies
When we should be more together
With our families, Lord
Singin' oh, oh, we are but one small town
Compared to the great cities that they tie us on
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We are but little people
Too little to be trampled on
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And we are but one small town compared
To the great cities that they tie us on
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And we are but little people long
Too little to be trampled on
Oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah
And we are but one small town compared (Oh)
I sing it home alone
And we are but little people, love too little to be counted
