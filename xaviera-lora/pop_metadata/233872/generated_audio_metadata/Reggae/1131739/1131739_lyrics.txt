Please don't go away
I'll hurt so much
I need you here
Can you hear me?
I love you
Please don't go away

I hurt so much
I love you, I need you here, I want you to stay
I love you, oh baby, can't you hear me calling
Please don't go away'cause I'll hurt too much
I need you here with me, can't you hear me?
I love you, baby, I'm calling
I love you, I love you, love you, love you, love you, ooh, baby
I love you, please don't go away
I love you, I need you here, I want you to stay
Ooh, can't you hear me, I just
