See them run like a thief in the night but they can't run away from themselves
No, can't run away from themselves
See them run, see them run, see them hide from their own conscience
Tell me how does it feel when you try to get your sleep in the middle of the night? Well
Can't run away from yourself, ayy
Can't run away from yourself now, now
No matter how you try, boy, you can't run away, oh-oh-oh, ayy
Can't run away from yourself, no you can't, boy
You can't run away from yourself, no you can't
No matter how you try, you can't run away, oh-oh-oh
See them run like a thief in the night but they can't run away from themselves
No, can't run away from themselves
See them run, see them run, see them hide from their own conscience
Tell me how does it feel when you try to get your sleep in the middle of the night, well
Can't run away from yourself, ayy
Can't run away from yourself, no, no
No matter how you try, well, you can't run away, oh-oh-oh, ayy
Can't run away from yourself, no, you can't
Boy, you can't run away from yourself, no, you can
No matter how you try, you can't run away, oh-oh, oh
You can't run away
You can't run away
You can't run away
