I never thought
The day will come
Now I see my whole world becomes topsy turvy
I never knew
I would go head over heels
Never knew I would get caught
In a trap like this
Now all I can think of
Is nobody but you
Every day and night I only dream of you
I'm trapped by love with no way out
Trapped by love there is no doubt
Trapped by love what can I do?
Trapped by love, girl I'm falling for you
I've always been running around
Never thought about settling down
I never knew I would meet that one girl
That one that many men would call a dream girl
And now that I've found you
I don't know what to do
I'm trapped by love
To me that is something new
I'm trapped by love with no way out
Trapped by love there is no doubt
Trapped by love what can I do
Trapped by love girl I'm falling for you
It all happened real suddenly
I did not know what really hit me
It is very difficult for me to accept this
But I know that I'm truly in love with you
I'm trapped by love with no way out
Trapped by love there is no doubt
Trapped by love what can I do
Trapped by love girl I'm falling for you
