Moonlight, falling on my face
He was talking sweet
Wrong time, wrong place
I was running, couldn't understand
Then the fire spoke
From my trembling hand
Now sirens hum like lullabies
And I can't wash these tears
No matter how I try
Oh mama, mama, I didn't mean that pain
Didn't mean to let my heart go insane
Now that shadow in my hand
Blood on the sand
And I can't take it back again
He said love me
Don't let go
But the night was deep
And the truth too cold
Every promise turns to dust
'Cause every kiss burns down to rust
Now the mirror won't show my name
All I see is smoke and shade
Oh, my, my, my, my, I didn't mean that pain
Didn't mean to let my heart go insane
Now there's shadow in my head
Blood on the sand
And I can't take it back again
He said, "Girl, don't cry"
But I saw the truth behind his lie
One shot, one breath, one prayer to the sky
I just keep asking why
Oh, mama, mama, I didn't mean that bad
Didn't mean to let my heart go insane (my heart go insane)
Now there's shadow in my head (shadow in my head)
Dust on the land (dust on the land)
And then my love gone with the rain
