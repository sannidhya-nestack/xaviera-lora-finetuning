Are you sitting alone looking past today
Wondering if you're always gonna feel this way
Cause you don't know the reasons why
Staring at the walls and at the telephone
Thinking you've gotta face this pain all alone
And you think you're not supposed to cry
You can come take a walk with me
Sit down and talk with me
Tell me what you're feeling inside
Don't let your heart keep tearing
The time has come for sharing
Feelings you can no longer hide
Feelings you can no longer hide
Now I'm from this confusion but you still feel the pain
Lost in life's illusions are you going insane
Cause you don't know the reasons why
Am I the only one around who feels this way?
Did I do something wrong? Now I have to pay
Are you feeling like you want to die?
You can come take a walk with me
Sit down and talk with me
Tell me what you're feeling inside
Don't let your heart keep tearing
The times come for sharing feelings
You can no longer hide
Feelings you can no longer hide
Feelings you can no longer hide
You can come take a walk with me
Sit down and talk with me
Tell me what you're feeling inside
Oh, don't let your heart keep tearing
The time's come for sharing feelings
You can no longer hide
Feelings you can no longer hide
Feelings you can no longer hide
