Turn up
Turn up, turn up, uh-huh, uh-huh
Turn up, turn up, uh-huh, uh-huh
Turn up, turn up
I see you ain't got a lot to say but
You step up in the club and catch my favor
I lick my lips like you my favorite flavor
You're like the kind I wanna hurry up and savor
In and out with my body like Cadiz (what)
Got your attention and you just cannot dismiss (what)
We not gon' mention'bout your verdict or extension
I got you in suspension in every dimension
You cannot resist
I got just what you're looking
He got just what you're cooking
I got the right position
To satisfy your mission
I know you know it's time to handle business
You cannot resist

If you don't know I'm working
Then I know my mind's workin'
See I got you lurkin' (turn up, turn up)
Turn up, turn up, babe
In and out with my body like a diss (what)
Got your attention or you just gonna dismiss (what)
Ain't no mistaken, I don't waste no time with fakin'
I already know what makes me blow that kinda thing that you cannot resist
I got just what you're lookin'
Keep down just what you're cookin' (where are my hips)

To satisfy your mission (where are my hips)
I know you know it's time to handle business (y'all cannot resist)
And you cannot resist, yeah, uh, uh-huh, yeah, right
And see they call me Anale Deco
And when they see I'm confident they call me critical
Attracted to intellectual baggage
You ain't afraid of a baddest chick out they paper and also physical
But you gotta step it right where the door
me I'm not that type of chick that's quick to go, no
Because I got a lotta, lotta roots
She wally-wally can't nobody stop me
And it's got you on fire (it's got you on fire)
Got you on fire (it's got you on fire)
I got the right position (when I move my hips, babe)
To satisfy your imagination (I know you know)
It's time to handle this
You can't resist (you can't resist)
You can't resist (you can't resist)
I got just what you're looking
Beat up just what you're looking
I got the right position
To satisfy your vision
I know you know it's time to handle this
You cannot resist (You cannot resist)
And you cannot resist
You cannot resist (You cannot resist)
I got just what you're looking for (I got just what you're looking for)
He got just what you're looking for (He got just what you're looking for)
I got the right position to satisfy your expectations (I got the right position to satisfy your expectations)
I know you know (You know it's time to handle this)
You cannot resist (You cannot resist)
And you cannot resist
And you cannot resist me baby (When I move my hips)
When I move it, when I move it, when I move my hips baby (When I move my hips)
I know you know it's time to handle business (And you cannot resist)
And you cannot resist me
