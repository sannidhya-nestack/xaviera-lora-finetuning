It hurts me when me been so long
Me keep back a me yard a write some hit song
It hurts me when me been so long
Me keep back a hole a meditation
Keep on the outside and a cut and come in
Heart a fi pure and your mouth a fi clean
No follow the evil man and don't kill the supreme
Me the wrist dem sharper than any laser beam
Keep on the outside and a cut and come in
Heart a fi pure and your mouth a fi clean
No follow the evil man and don't kill the supreme
Me the wrist dem sharper than any laser beam
Look like a argument and offer them lack of space
Like some kidden go to school them only got a warm seat
Me open up me mouth dem ready fi repeat
Me don't talk already and me just not repeat
You a like it we keep the trampling on me feet
And offer them coal and a wardrobe fi dem sheet
No talk off of the cliff because you know what they say deep
Me don't talk already and me just not repeat
Step on the outside and a cut and come in
Heart a fi pure and your mouth a fi clean
The evil man a don't heal the supreme
Many reach them sharper than any laser beam
Step on the outside and a cut and come in
Heart a fi pure and your mouth a fi clean
No follow the evil man a don't heal the supreme
Many reach them clean just like bible leaf
Like a laba learn fi balance and focus
A believe on the people dem like a locust
Dem want fi achieve and a god dem a curse
Dunno who dem are dem, dunno dem purpose
And when dem up me up, dem a tell me seh dem brave
Dem only do the things that send them to them grave
Dem a fab bag of money and still living in a slave
Me never follow dem man fi them ducky ways
Step on the outside and a cut and come in
Heart a fi pure and your mouth a fi clean
Not follow the evil man and don't kill the supreme
Me lyrics dem sharper than any laser beam
Step on the outside and a cut and come in
Half it pure and your mouth half it clean
No follow the evil man and don't yield the supreme
Melories them sharper than any laser beam
Dem a some powerless people
Aye check out the youth dem where I go
They get up everyday killing people
Aye and inna dem pocket dem have a Bible
Listen to me people, ay, you no fi study no evil, yo
And you no read up your bible, and be like one a judge a disciple
Step on the outside and a cut and come in
Heart a fi pure and your mouth a fi clean
No follow the evil man and don't kill the supreme
Many ribs dem sharper than any laser beam
Step on the outside and a cut and come in
Heart a fi pure and your mouth a fi clean
No follow the evil man and don't kill the supreme
Many ribs dem sharper than any laser beam
Oh, me give them the runway for running
And them can't take it, can't handle it
So right now is my time, my share
Sugar, tea, I've no fear, it's terrible
Tell them say me find a new gear every time
Me come to take it this year, as them say
Dark day ya, more than born
Step on the outside and a cut and come in
Heart a fi pure and your mouth a fi clean
No follow the evil man a down here in the supreme
Middle reach dem sharper than any laser beam
Step on the outside and a cut and come in
Heart a fi pure and your mouth a fi clean
No follow the evil man a down here in the supreme
Middle reach dem sharper than any laser beam
