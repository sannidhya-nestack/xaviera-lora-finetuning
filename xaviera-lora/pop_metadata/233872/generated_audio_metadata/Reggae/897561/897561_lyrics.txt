Lyrical worry upon the front line
Music soldier speaking to your mind
If you really wanna seek you should find
Answers won't make you wise so
Keep a rocking on down the line
Backers everyday all the while
Keep a fighting struggling ride
Can't stop can't quit we be running like road shows
Studio session everyday on a mission
Every other day we be on a plane
Not for the paper or the fame
Just for the thriller, bouncy lyrics everyday
Riding the rhythm and you know we can't stop
Peaceful warrior, we killing it pon the track
Music called murder, we done that
Pay a fire pon the mic you know we just a charm
Charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm
Charm, charm, charm, charm, charm (Charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm, charm (Charm! Charm! Charm! Charm! Charm! Charm! Charm! Charm! Charm! Charm! Charm! Charm! Charm! Charm! Charm! Charm! Charm! Charm! Charm!
That's why we a bully for legend
Answers won't make you wise so
Keep a rocking on down the line
Backers everyday all the while
Keep a fighting struggling ride
Can't stop can't quit we be running like road shows
Studio session everyday on a mission every other day
We be on the plane not for the paper or the fame
Just for the thrill of bouncing lyrics everyday
Riding the rhythm and you know we can't stop
Peaceful warrior waking up on the track
Musical murder we done that
PFI up on the mic you know it's just a chart, chart, chart, chart, chart, chart, chart, chart, chart, chart, chart, chart, chart, chart, chart, chart, chart, chart, chart
