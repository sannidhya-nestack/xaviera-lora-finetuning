You find yourself just reading all the headlines
Never digging too deep for a cause
Bahamas, cellphones, car phones on plastic engulfing your spare time
You say don't bring me down'cause the war don't exist in my town
Don't box yourself
Don't box yourself
Don't box yourself
All the way in
You find yourself just protecting your investments
Your day is governed by returns you may or may not see
These idealities grow and flow alongside your assets
But don't be surprised if the war finds its way to your town
Don't box yourself
Don't box yourself
Don't box yourself
All the way in
Don't get me wrong, I ain't some kind of ethical beacon
As a matter of fact, I have some bones of my own
If you look around, we're all self-serving and driven
But I don't pretend that the war doesn't live in my town
Don't box yourself
Don't box yourself
Don't box yourself all the way in
All the way in
Don't box yourself
Don't box yourself
Don't box yourself
All the way in
All the way in
Don't box yourself
