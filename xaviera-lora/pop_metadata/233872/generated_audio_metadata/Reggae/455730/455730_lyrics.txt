Mmm, whoa, ah, yeah
I wanna tell you how much I've enjoyed tonight
Just to be with you makes everything alright
The love I need is right here in my hands
I wanna give you darling all the love I can
I wanna love you up tonight
I wanna love you up tonight
I wanna love you up
All night
I wanna love you all
All night
Whoa
I know it's late
But please don't you walk away
Right here with me
Is where I want you to stay
So don't be afraid
To open up your heart
Move a little closer now
And let the loving start
I wanna love you out tonight
I wanna love you up tonight
I wanna love you up all night
I wanna love you up all night
I wanna love you up tonight
I wanna love you up
Tonight, yeah
I wanna tell you
How much I've enjoyed tonight
Just to be with you
Makes everything new
I wanna love you
Tonight, I wanna love you
All night, I wanna love you
All night
