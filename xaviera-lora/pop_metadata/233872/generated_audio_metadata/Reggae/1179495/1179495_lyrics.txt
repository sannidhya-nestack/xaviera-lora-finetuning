Candle light by the beach, listen to the summer breeze
As the tide rolls in my love, you are so sweet
Being together in this perfect setting for a simple night of love
We all know those stars
Cause I will give you loving baby
Like you've never had before
you are my special lady
It's coming straight from my heart
Ooh, yeah
From the first time I saw you
I knew you would be mine
Before I made my move
Oh gosh, you look so fine
No other place I'd rather be now
Than spending quality time with you my love
Cause I will give you loving baby
Like you never had before
Cause you are my special lady
It's coming straight from my heart
Baby, I love you from my heart, oh yeah
And I hope we never part, no way
You are my soul mate, oh yeah
Forever together, my love, uh huh
I will give you loving, baby
Like you've never had before
Oh yeah
Cause you are my special lady (my special lady)
It's coming straight from my heart
Cause I will give you loving baby (baby)
Like you've never had before
