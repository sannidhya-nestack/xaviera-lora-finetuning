Now to know say we no pray for it's lack
That's what black is all about
It's for living our heart out and poor people living our snacks
Unno get that
Ain't no
Stack out
There's something'bout the way I feel I won't hold back now
My mind's made up to make it somehow
How can my people stand to live in this way?
There's gotta be a better way
It's always sad to be living this way
But I gotta move on
But I gotta move on to a better, brighter day
I'm a step up, people live up in a one piece of shacks
Can't move forward and we not turn back
Help we find out so we can reach one path
And in a way we all are the stumbling blocks
Over certain situations, don't you know me have it shut
Shut about the big guys, well live up on the hill top
Rich people store room and poor people living room
Poor people can't afford bond if they buy a yard roof
So ya mother and father, daughter and son
Start dem and say dem want to know what I go do
If they don't know what I go do
I pay a blood while you run
If a blood make it run
If a fire make it bunch up
What fi happen let it happen and done
I say it's spotlight down inna jam down
And dem show can't di go and go out
Who no fun tell dem
Poor people live up inna one piece of shacks
Can't move forward and we no turn back in do
I've got nothing I can say is my own
The lanes and streets my only school ground
I know one day a change will come
But for now I'll keep holding on
It's always sad to be living this way
But I gotta move on to
A brighter day
It's always sad to be living this way
But I gotta move on to a better brighter day
See ya, them have the money, no want give it none
It seems like them want poor people take up gold
See ya, them have the money, no want give it none
No want big ghetto youth be elite be totally slum
Can't sugar dick with only weak hand tongue
I'm an idiot to make people have fun
Attacking to the bigger and drip on the hill top
The whole wide world is a big big ghetto
Who live down inna the flat
Who dey pon de hill top
Don't you know from sugar chat
Everybody a pay rock
Come poor people and live up inna one piece a shacks
Can't move forward and we na turn back
El pre-father so we can reach pan top
Although inna we we a lot a stumbling block
Because them have the money
No one give it unto them
It's just like dem wan' put people take up gun
They no want get to you, elevate totally stop
And if we take up gunna pay blood, why you run?
If a blood make it run, if a fire make it burn, just watch me I'ma let it happen and done
I strike this pot like dung in a damn dung
