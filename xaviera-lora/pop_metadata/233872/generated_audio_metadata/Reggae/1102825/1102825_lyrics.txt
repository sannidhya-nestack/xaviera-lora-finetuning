All about you
All about you
Hey
Oh
As I lie in this bed in this gym
I'm still thinking about you
I remember they called me a fool
Cause I'll be always loving you
My friends they told me that you would be the end of me
But I ignore it all because I knew that for you
I would go to war for you
I would climb the highest mountain
Turn my back on my family
Because of you
Now here I am all alone
Shedding tears all because of you
You, you
Everything I did was because of you
Everything I did was because of you
I'll do anything all because of you
For you
All for you
It's all because of you
As I cry this bitter tear
In the floors of this jail cell
I'm still thinking that
I'll be your criminal if you ask me to
Oh hell, I'm such a fool
But I don't care
Is this the love that they've been talking about?
I know that I'm in so much trouble
And I wanna be if it's'cause of you
Yet I wanna be here if it's because of you
I'll be your knight in shining armor
I will fight all your battles baby for you
All for you
Everything I did was because of you
Everything I did was because of you
I'll do anything all because of you
For you
All for you
It's all because of you
All for you
It's all because of you
