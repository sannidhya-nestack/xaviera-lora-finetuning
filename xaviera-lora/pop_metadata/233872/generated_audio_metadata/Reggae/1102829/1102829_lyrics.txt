Now you know it's true
Yeah, woah
Now you know it's true
Yeah, oh, ah, ah
Now you know it's true
Now you heard the truth
Now you know the things they said about beans or lies
So what's you gonna do?
Now you heard the truth
we both have said something that not so nice
Words have been spoken and angry you're angry
And who's gonna say I'm sorry now?
So how do we go forward now?
That is out in the open
Now you know the truth
I guess that now we're good
Yeah, yeah
Now you know the truth
I guess that now we're good
I guess that it's time to say you're sorry
now you know the truth
I guess that now we're good
I guess that it's time to say I'm sorry
I'm sorry now you know the truth
I'm just a man who was trying to love you in the best way that I can
I guess you couldn't see the honesty
you've been hurt too many times and I don't blame you
But I guess this time you'll know that I'm for real
Baby, words I've been spoken
I'm angry, you're angry
So who's gonna say I'm sorry now
But now that you know the truth
Baby, where do we go from here?
Baby, I guess that it's time to say that you're so sorry
Now you know the truth, I guess that now we're through
I guess that it's time to say you're sorry
now you know the truth
I guess that now we're good
I guess that it's time to say I'm sorry
I'm sorry baby
We both said something that are not so nice
I apologize
And I expect you to do the same
now you know the truth
Now you know the truth
Now you know the truth
Now you know the truth
That I'm for real
I wouldn't hurt you
Or try to make you cry
