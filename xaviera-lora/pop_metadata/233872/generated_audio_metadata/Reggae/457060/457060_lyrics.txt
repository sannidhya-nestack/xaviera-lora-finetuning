When I passed the streets of Bombay
I met a wise man by the wall
I asked him for his wisdom
He picked his phone and made a call
He said, "Well, well, well, I can't tell
It's all up to you, my friend
Choose wisely and in a way precisely"
Now my son, he said then, lifted his crotch like a pumpkin
I gotta make this call right now, so get the fuck out of my son
When I passed the streets of London
I met a wise man on a bank
I asked him for his wisdom
He looked at me like a crank
He said well well well
I can tell
It's all up to you my friend
Choose wisely
And in a way precisely
Now my son he said that I kinda run out of my pills of fun
Get myself to the shrink now so get the fuck out of my son
Back at home I saw her, the lady looked so wise
I asked her for wisdom, she looked at me and smiled
She said well well well, I can't tell
Then she gave me a kiss and then I knew
It's all about love, it's all about you
It's all about love
It's all about love
It's all about love
It's all about love
