You know, I have a lot of things to say to you people out there
All the broken hearted and the lonely in heart
I know there's a lot of obstacles in our way
But I can tell you one thing man, keep on pressing through
Hold tight and faith
Wow!
As I said, the act of the battle is the sweet of the picture
Hang tight, never give up
When it seems like no way out, out, out
Then the Lord will work things out
He will make a way out of nowhere, wow
When it seems like no way out, out, out
Then the Lord will work things out
He will make a way out of nowhere, wow
Enough people a live them life in a doubt, hey
Enough a dem a work and can't buy food for dem house
Enough hear the youth ya and run out a town
Shoot them with words, words and sound
In anything you do me say try not be a clown
Don't make no one try and get you down
Place your feet on this solid ground
Stay focus on this higher ground
When it seems like no way out
Out, out
Then the Lord will work things out
He will make a way out of nowhere
When it seems like no way out
Out, out
Then the Lord will work things out
He will make a way out of nowhere
When you see your brother you must help him out
When you see your sister you must help her out
Don't left your brother, don't left him to drown
Don't make your sister dem frown, ey
When you see your people you must give dem a help
Don't leave dem like no buckle pan shelf
Don't leave dem like no empty shell
Stabbing up your face and walk away with the wealth
When it seems like no way out
Out, out
Then the Lord will work things out
He will make a way out of nowhere
When it seems like no way out
Out, out
Then the Lord will work things out
He will make a way out of nowhere
Behind the dark cloud there is a silver line
Inna every tunnel there's a golden light
When the light a shine let it shine so bright
Throughout this world inna every one life
When you see your people you mustn't give them a fight
No lift them inna the jewel through the darkest night
When you see your people you must help them out
Just to make things right
Cause when it seems like no way out, out, out
Then the Lord will work things out
He will make a way out of nowhere
When it seems like no way out, out, out
Then the Lord will work things out
He will make a way out of nowhere
Hey, you know there's a lot of things we have in this world
That we can share it with each other
Just to make this world a better place
But you know what? Ha, ha
Some people want it all for themselves
While others care
And we feel it that if we have it
We should just spread it far and wide
When it seems like no way out, out, out
Then the Lord will work things out
He will make a way out of nowhere
When it seems like no way out, out
Then the Lord will work things out
He will make a way out of nowhere
Nuff people a live dem life in a doubt
Nuff a dem a work and can't buy food for dem house
Nuff hear me voice and run out a town
Shoot dem with words
Powers and sound
In anything you do me say
Try no be a clown
Don't make no one try and get you down
Place your feet on this solid ground
Stay focus on one higher ground
You know this is small box production
And we spreading this message across the nation
That we should feel each other burden
And so we should care and share with each other
You know, that could make this world be a better place
Don't store it up for yourself
And the poor and the needy ones are looking for us
They all need us
