Lost in my system
And it's good to keep on going
In my mind there's something I don't know
It's a shadow and a light
They're fighting up inside of my head
And it grows, it grows
And it grows, yes it grows
What I lost and my system, my fear, pain and my heart
Look for freedom, look inside me
Want a chance for one more start
I can't breathe, I can't move, I can't sleep, get no groove
And when I wake up it's the same again
Vrindavan ki kunj kalne
Vrindavan ki, Vrindavan ki
काहे रोकत जगर प्यार न दैलाल मैं रोकाए
ठीत लगर, ठीत लगर
And I'm dreaming of friendship
Between my feelings I can't sort out
Crazy feelings, crazy stories
They are accompanying my life
My sweet life
My sweet lie, my lie
When I'm lost in my system I feel pain in my heart
Look for freedom inside me
Want a chance for one more start
I can't breathe, I can't move, I can't sleep
Got no groove and when I wake up it's the same again
(Teka te tabi nani mo e)
Lost in my system (Teka te tabi nani mo e, lost in my system)
I can't breathe, I can't move, I can't sleep
Got no groove and when I wake up it's the same again
I can't breathe, I can't move ,I can't sleep
Got no groove and when I wake up it's the same again
Can't breathe, I can't move, I can't sleep, got no groove and when I wake up it's the same again
