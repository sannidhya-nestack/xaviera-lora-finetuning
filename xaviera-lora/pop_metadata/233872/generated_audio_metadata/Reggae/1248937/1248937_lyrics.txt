Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Moon lights down, moon lights down
Moon lights down, woah
Underneath the moon lights
We feel high revives
Everything is nice, no need to hide
If you're ready, music will start the grind
Ooh, dancing in the moonlight, feeling so alive
Ooh, moonlight's gone, we're now over
Move on through, no time to slide
Inna the moonlight, yeah, we rock and shine
Feel the rhythm, it don't stop
Stars that shine bright, inna the dark sky
We come together feel so high
There put on the sand
We feel so free
Ooh
Dancing to the rhythm
Just you and me
Ooh
Moonlight's come, we're not hold back
Move and groove, no time for slack
Inna di moonlight, we rock and shock
Feel the rhythm, it don't stop
Feel the dance line, feel the melody
Moonlight dancing in perfect harmony
No worries, no stress
Just pure bliss
Inna di moonlight
We find happiness, ooh, ooh, ooh
Moonlight's down, we're not over
Move and groove, no time to stop
Inna the moonlight, we rock and shop
Hear the rhythm, it don't stop
Moonlight's down'til the break of dawn
This feeling we could never show
On the moon, the moonlight, we feel alright
Ooh, moonlight's gone, dancing through the night
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Moonlight's gone, to the break of dawn
This feeling we can never sound
But beneath the moonlight, we feel alright
Ooh, moonlight's gone, dancing through the night
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Moonlight's gone, dancing through the night
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Moonlight's come to the break of dawn
This feeling we could never stop
Underneath the moonlight I feel alright
Ooh, moonlight's come dancing through time
