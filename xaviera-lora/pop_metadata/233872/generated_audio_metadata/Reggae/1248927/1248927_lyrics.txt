And if it's your life, you have to keep cool
Don't get caught up, be not them fool
Just make them talk, them chat, them bubble
You stay calm, your spirit not unravel
Chill out, no worry, everything aight
Stay positive, keep your voice high
Let them say what they want, just let them be
You do you, stay free and easy
Babylon tried to bring you down
But you're holding head up, nowhere to run
Just keep trotting on
One step at a time
Inna dis ya journey
You must shine
Chill out, no worry
Everything aight
Feel positive, keep your vibes high
Let them say what they want
Just let them be
You do you, stay free and easy
Then try to test your patience
But you'll now get caught in a frustration
Just breathe in, breathe out, let it all pass
Inna dis ya life, you know you're alive
Chill out, no worry
Everything like
Stay positive, keep the vibes high
Let them say what they want
Just let them be
You do you, stay free and easy
Then try if it tears, test your patience
But you'll not get caught in a frustration
Just breathe in, breathe out, let it all pass
Inna dis ya life, inno ya Allah
Chill out, no worry, everything irie
Stay positive, keep your vibes high
Let them say what they want, just let them be
You do you, stay free and easy
