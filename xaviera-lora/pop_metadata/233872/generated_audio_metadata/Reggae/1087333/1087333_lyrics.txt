Rise up black people, rise up, and the powers
And me tell me nation dem say for rise up, you know, and rise up
And the powers, remember that
Sugar D say, me sing (humming)
And the powers (humming)
Only a fool, lean up on them own misunderstanding
The ship where them a sailing, a it going to tilt
Me phone no touch people, things just a panting
Make sure you and Jah have a link
Because a fool, lean up on them own misunderstanding
The ship where them a sailing, a it going to sink
Me phone no touch people, things just a panting
Make sure you and Jah Jah, oy me madak
Rasta man no ita meet cha for me fit this King David with the sheep flock
Remember that
Pinky man just keep you sabbat with the Queen as a rainbow
And win and turn back

No go fire dem sixteen magnum dark black
Remember that
Politics don't try to attack
Ca this is sugar the way tougher than Gibraltar rock
I ain't sata, I ain't sata, I ain't sata sat
I sight the man from up a bus rack
I sight the black Christ sat up on a rack
Him sat up on a rack on the mountain top
And when me say so me no want to no get heart attack
Remember that a down a country me get it shot
Remember that, now me have the whole world a rack
Remember that, Suga D just start to chat

Disciple dem a seal inna igwa into skin
Before no touch ghetto you just tap and cling
Make sure you want Jah Jah, oy
Maybe lock me out salil up on the rock
Nothing cover the rock where the pon the mountain top
Had the faith in a cell a see I man hold to the map
Move it pon the right line a man guarantee in me mind
The stomach knock up it trust neither bad mind
Remember that
Youth and youth just care and share
The power of love and it we take on any bear
Remember that
Love people out there and fear
Just to give a tinny binny little binny share only a fool
Lean upon them own misunderstanding
The ship where them a sail in a hit going to sink
For no thought people think just upon him
We are only an unseen
Remember that me princess love to look at her, she love piss the pot in her atal maxif rack
Remember that the woman dem love is pentious
Love to spend it in a thousand and million
But a virtuous woman is number one
Remember that woman dem love feel look at

Trap on me feet this king
David with the ship lock, remember that
