Raise him, raise him
Rise up for a fight, yes I
Praise him, praise him
Shout ya, shout ya
Each and every day, hey hey
Listen to me I say hey
Praise is to his name
Shout ya, shout ya
Each and every day, hey hey
Hear me when I say
He's the only way
I wake up in the mornings
Food is on my table
I'm wheeling unable
He gives me health and strength
To take me through the day
And it's the only way, shout ya (shout ya)
Each and every day (Rastafari)
Listen to me I say, praise is to his name, shout ya (shout ya)
Each and every day (Rastafari)
Hear me when I say, it's the only way
Always follow the teachings of our Father
And He will take care of us
Like in days of old He will be with us
And he will lead the way
Shout out, shout, shout, shout
Each and every day
Listen to me I say
Praise is to his name
Shout out, shout, shout, shout
Each and every day
Hear me when I say
He's the only way
Breezin'
Ja ja ja ja
Breezin'
Ja we lay these people out of Babylon
And he goes to promised land
Jah will always keep his promise
His words shall never pass away
Shout Jah
(Rastafari) Listen to me I say
Raise this to his name (Rastafari) Show Jah (Show Jah) (Rastafari) Listen to me I say
Raise this to his name (Rastafari, Show Jah) (Rastafari, Show Jah) (Show Jah, Show Jah)
Each and every day
Listen me a say
Raise this to me
Shout yeah
Each and every day
Every when I say
Is the only way
Shout yeah
