I watch the sunset from my bungalow
And search for buried treasure in my soul
Loads of seagull in the Auburn sky
Seems to wink at me as he flies by
In a little while I'll take a walk on Sugar Beach
Hit some markets, find some chefs
Living all alone in paradise is bittersweet
I wanna share it all with someone else
Live a life of love with me
On my island
In the lap of luxury
On my island
Skinny dip beneath the coral reefs
Take our love to high volcanic peaks
Sing and dance as we celebrate
Such joy and happiness we found today
If you think that this is maybe what you're looking for
Write a letter, let me know
Put it in a bottle, drop it in the ocean blue
Make a wish and you may soon
Live a life of love with me on my island
In the lap of luxury on my island
If you think that this is maybe what you're looking for
Write a letter, let me know
Put it in a bottle, drop it in the ocean blue
Make a wish and you may soon
Live a life of love with me on my island
In the lap of luxury on my island
Live a life of love with me on my island
In the lap of luxury on my island
