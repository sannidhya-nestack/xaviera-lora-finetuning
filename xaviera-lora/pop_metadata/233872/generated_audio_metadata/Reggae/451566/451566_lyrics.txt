Darling since you've grown
It's so clear that I can see
All this so called freedom
Ain't what it's cracked up to be
Ain't no need denying
It was I who made the choice
No darling, I'm not really crying
Just a trembling in my voice
I'm not really crying
No, I'm not in any pain
I swear I'm not really crying
I've just been out in the rain
And it gets kinda cold sometimes
Now that we have parted and I'm gone our separate ways
Funny, my tomorrows, they turn out just like today
And that's no good because the daytime turned too quickly into night
And that's when I get those strangers feeling
That something just ain't right, oh no
But I'm not really crying
No, I'm not in any pain
I swear, I'm not really crying, oh no
I've just been out in the rain
And it gets kinda cold sometimes
I'm not really buying, girl you ask that every time
I'm not really buying, though it has been on my mind
I'm not really buying, no I'm not in it ain't
Can't you see, I've just been out in the rain
And it's pouring down on me
