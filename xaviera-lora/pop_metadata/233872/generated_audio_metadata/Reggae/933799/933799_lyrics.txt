Baby, baby, this is blue
Blue like deja vu
Blue like overdue
Blue like this is nothing new
Baby, baby, this is blue
Blue like me and you
Blue like you're blue, dude
Don't work the way it used to
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue, blue
Baby, baby, this is blue
Blue like where are you
Blue like what I can do
Blue like you ain't got a clue
Baby, baby, this is blue
Blue like out of true
Blue like we are through
And I got better things to do
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue, blue
All around
Baby baby this is blue
Blue like deja vu
Blue like overdue
Blue like this is nothing new
Baby baby this is blue
Blue like me and you
Blue like your voodoo
Don't walk the way it used to
Baby baby this is blue
Blue like deja vu
Blue like overdue
Blue like this is nothing new
Baby baby this is blue
Blue like me and you
Blue like your voodoo
Don't what the way it used to
Blue blue blue blue blue blue
Blue blue blue blue blue blue blue
Blue blue blue blue blue blue
Blue blue blue blue blue blue
