Oh yeah, she's gone
Oh yeah, she's gone
Oh yeah, she's gone
She's gone away
She's gone, she's gone, she is gone
True that, I'm not so strong
Too long, oh too long, I'm so blue
Do I belong in an illusion?
Becoming a confusion, decision
With multiple directions
Receiving a love that's way gone
She's gone, she is gone
Oh yeah, she's gone
Oh yeah, she's gone
Oh yeah, she's gone
She's gone away
She's gone, she's gone, she is gone
You know you never gonna miss her till she's nowhere around
Too bad, too sad, no good to complain
For right ya know, no need to explain
If loving is forever she will come again
But love is like sunshine and rain
And like the seasons and how they've changed
But for right ya know, she is gone
Oh yeah, she's gone
Oh yeah, she's gone
Oh yeah, she's gone
She's gone away
Oh yeah, she's gone
Oh yeah, she's gone
Oh yeah, she's gone
She's gone away
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone, so what?
Why are you hanging on? Live on
Time for the break of dawn, so true
Why are you living in delusion?
Stuck in an obsession, possession
Lose your indiscretion
Believing in a love that's gone so long
She's gone
Got to move on
Oh yeah she's gone, oh yeah she's gone, oh yeah she's gone
She's gone away (the loser in this crash show)
Oh yeah she's gone (the loser in this crash show)
Oh yeah she's gone, oh yeah she's gone
She's gone away
You know she's gone
Oh yeah she's gone
You know she's gone
Oh yeah she's gone
Oh yeah she's gone
She's gone away
You know she's gone
Oh yeah she's gone
You know she's gone
Oh yeah she's gone
Oh yeah she's gone
She's gone away
Oh yeah, she's gone, oh yeah, she's gone, oh yeah, she gone, she's gone away, oh yeah, she's gone, oh yeah she's gone
