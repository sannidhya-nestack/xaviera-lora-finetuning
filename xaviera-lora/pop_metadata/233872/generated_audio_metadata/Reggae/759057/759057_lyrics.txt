Oh na na na na na na

Baby girl if you was all mine
Things would be sweet baby like fresh wine
Every night we'll be good so fine
And come tomorrow we press rewind
Right from the start I saw her in loves
What I felt inside my heart
Every night she comes in my dreams
Even though we're miles apart
Like sun on the ocean
She touch my emotion
This girl so fine it's crazy
Oh she got that skin that smooth like lotion
Watching hers like poetry in motion
That's why I want her so bad oh
A beautiful girl she's sweet
As can be, a beautiful girl
These girls so fine, them like them what they see
A beautiful girl
So sweet, just like candy yeah
I got to make her mine, she's so lovely
Believe me when I say, she takes my breath away
From head to toe, girl, your beauty just glows
I think I love her more, more, more
Yes, I love her more, more, more
Without running game, I'd like to know your name
Like sun on the ocean, she touch my emotion
This girl so fine, it's crazy, oh
She got that skin that's smooth like lotion
Watching hers like poetry in motion
That's why I want her so bad, oh
What a beautiful girl, she's sweet
As can be, a beautiful girl
This girl's so fine, just like the one they say
A beautiful girl, so sweet
Just like candy, yeah
