You make me feel so good, so good
You make me feel so good, so good
You make me feel so good, so good
You make me feel so good, so good
You light the sunlight, light the moonlight
You brighten my day, you light up my night
You light the starlight, shining so bright
Oh girl, you are just right
You make me feel so good, so good
You make me feel so good, so good
You make me feel so good, so good
You make me feel so good, so good
You've lots of sugar in my tea
You've been so good to me
Like a river it keeps flowing
My love for you girl just keeps on growing
You make me feel so good
So good, you make me feel so good
So good, you make me feel so good
So good, you make me feel so good
So good
When I'm with you, I feel so happy
When I'm feeling down, you're there to comfort me
Girl I love you, I love you truly
Oh girl, you're everything to me
You make me feel so good, so good
You make me feel so good, so good
You make me feel so good, so good
