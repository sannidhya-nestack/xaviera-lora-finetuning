We got to find a way, we can't all live in the same place
When will it be that the road leads our way?
When will it be that we find our way?
When will it be how we dream of?
When will it be that we're the schemers?
How, how will we find our way?
Understand, please understand, please take my hand
No more war, no more fighting
No more cheating, no more hiding
And no more Babylon deciding
We've got to find a way
We can only say
It better be today
When will it be?
When will it be?
Hey don't you know
On and on
Now the dreadlocks in Babylon
When, when
Understand, are we dreamers?
Please take my hand, the world's dreamers
When will it be that the road is our way?
When will it be that we find our way?
Leaves on earth, is it just a dream?
The end of racism, we have never seen
Extinction or survival, we are in between
One love, one world, is it just vacant dreams?
No more battle, no more deciding, no more cheating, no more hiding, no more war, no more fighting
No more battle, no more deciding, no more cheating, no more hiding, no more war, no more fighting
No more war, no more fighting
No more cheating, no more hiding
Thanks to all good fighting to save the planet earth
