Living on the edge now (edge)
Yeah yeah yeah (edge)
Right now living on the edge
Trying not to fall off the ledge
Need something to keep me wedged
Got to keep the people engaged
Right now living on the edge
Trying not to fall off the ledge
Need something to keep me waged
Got to keep the people engaged
Signs of the time
Got to stay in line
This is serious time
But we will be fine
Come on fall in line
Let's have a joyful time
Don't let things decline
Don't just sit and whine
Right now living on the edge
Trying not to fall off the ledge
Need something to keep me waged
Got to keep the people engaged
Right now living on the edge
Trying not to fall off the ledge
Need something to keep me waged
Got to keep the people engaged
We've gotta do our thing, no matter what's happening
Don't let it keep you down, don't get turned around
Got to stand up and fight, things will be alright
Ain't no easing up
Got to stay on top
Right now living on the edge
Trying not to fall off the ledge
Need something to keep me waged
Got to keep the people engaged
Right now living on the edge
Trying not to fall off the ledge
Need something to keep me waged
Got to keep the people engaged
Together we'll get through
Don't stop there's work to do
Got to stay on track
Don't try to look back
Got to reach that goal
Your story will be told
Come on let's go
Let's rock the show
Right now living on the edge
Trying not to fall off the ledge
Need something to keep me wedged
Got to keep the people engaged
Right now living on the edge
Trying not to fall off the ledge
Need something to keep me wedged
Got to keep the people engaged (on the edge now)
Right now living on the edge
Trying not to fall off the ledge
Need something to keep me wed
Got to keep the people engaged
Right now I'm living on the edge
Trying not to fall off the ledge
Need something to keep me wed
Got to keep the people engaged
