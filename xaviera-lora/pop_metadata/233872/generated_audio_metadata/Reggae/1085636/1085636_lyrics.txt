They say I'm limited, Angel
Got to keep my knife
On the price
I'm limited again
Eyes on the prize, I got to keep my eyes on Jesus Christ
Keeping my eyes on the prize, I got to keep my eyes on Jesus Christ
What? On my eyes on the prize, I got to keep my eyes on Jesus Christ
Keeping my eyes on the prize, I got to keep my eyes on Jesus Christ
One time it did seem but me never realise
Livin' inna sin binna no time fi compromise
Unno fi livin' life right
Keepna eyes pon all a Christ
And see him first and everything that is right
In this a life, me sayu fi be alive
And the light where I shine come from Jesus Christ
Pan canna me casta when me go long di die
And we pinna on a morning if unna live right
Me tell you keepna rise
And the price, I got to keep my eyes on Jesus Christ
Keep in my eyes
And the price, I got to keep my eyes on Jesus
For me open up me eyes
Then me realise
Jesus Christ him on the way
The truth the light without him inna me life
I cannot survive
His yoke is easy, his burden is light
I got to keep my eyes
And the price, I got to keep my eyes on Jesus Christ
Yo, keep in my eyes
And the price, I got to keep my eyes on Jesus Christ
Yo, keep in my eyes
And the price, I got to keep my eyes on Jesus Christ
Keep in my eyes
And the price, I got to keep my eyes Jesus Christ
Why young people all no have to open up them eyes
Open up them mind and then realise
One way is to live and that's the way of Christ
No make the devil fool you and tell you no lie
Beauty all inna be all of the eyes
All in this world less of the flesh and the pride of life
And all you got to do just keep your eyes on the prize
And ask Jesus Christ to renew your mind
Keep my eyes on the prize
I got to keep my eyes on Jesus Christ
Keep in your eyes on the prize
I got to keep my eyes on Jesus Christ
Yo, keep in my eyes on the prize
I got to keep my eyes on Jesus Christ
Yo, keep in my eyes
And the price, I'm gonna keep my eyes on Jesus
One time me did seen but me never realize
Living ain't nothing me not no time to compromise
You know free living life right
Keep an eye upon all the Christ
And seek him first and everything that is right
In this life, me say you free be your light
And the line where I shine come from Jesus Christ
Pan Cal every cluster when me good land di die
And we pin and mold in the front all every rise
Yo keep in your eyes
And the price I got to keep my eyes on Jesus Christ
