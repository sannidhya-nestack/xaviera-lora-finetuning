Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (ha) (ha, ha, ha)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (I'm your mastermind)
You Levi (you Levi), you Levi (you Levi)
The war is over (over), gone is the soldier (soldier)
That tried to take land from my
From top of spring hill
Below is all still
Birds and the bees they fly
I thank you highly
Your love is almighty
As the lion you should to I
You a million miles away
Still I see you every day
Even though you not with I
Shabba, boy you love I
I know you love I, you love I, you love I
I sat in the yard, I watched the guard
Black dress better than I, mmm
I asked who is free, as he looks for the key
That will help all unlucky
Messy and loves shine down from above
Shines down from above into the free case of us
Whoa, heartbreakers
I know in my heart
Though we be apart
You will not abandon life (You will not abandon life)
For you love I (You love I)
I know you love I (You love I) (You love I)
You love I, you love I
And a rockstar lover
Hiding under the cover
Finding his figure lies
He's owes his sins
Diggin' the wheels
He think he better than I
Those times they gone
We could not hold on
Now we don't see eye to eye
I must move on
I must be gone
It's that long road before I
I must move on
I must be gone
It's a long road before I
I know you love I
I know you love I
You love I
I know you love I
I know you love I
You love I
You love I
You love I
You love I
You love I
