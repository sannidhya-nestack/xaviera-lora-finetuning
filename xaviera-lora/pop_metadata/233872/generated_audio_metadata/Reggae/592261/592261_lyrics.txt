Woah, yeah
I know all will be well once again
We'll find victory in the end
I wake up in the morning another brother down on the radio
And I wonder to myself
How much can I take off or will this go?
You see we got political strife
People trying to do what they think is right
Yet we got the ones who were sent to protect us
Making other families cry
All I got to say
This is my home, it's where I belong
I remember I've been here since then
And I'll be here tomorrow'cause I'm gonna stand strong
Mama people just hold on
If you know you're right then you can't be wrong
See we got the blessing from high
So look to your heart and look to the sky
We'll be that day when we've overcome
Even if my wake won't start
I can turn my face to the rising sun
Soon we'll be that day when we've overcome
Because I know my faith is strong I conquer all my enemies one by one
Suffering in silence no one can understand the pain we feel
All the pain around us everyday is violence surrounding me and I can't believe it's real
It's a situation you think only could be happening to someone else
While remembering a time gone by life is like a picture everything was fine
But I got to say hey
The kingdom is coming for you and me
We can climb the mountain top
And only need the faith of a mustard seed
Now all my people just hold on
If you know you're right then you can't be wrong
You see we got the blessing from high
So look to your heart then look to the sky
Soon we'll be that day when we've overcome
Even if my way grows dark (ah-ah)
I can turn my face to the rising sun (ah-ah)
Soon will be the day when we've overcome
Because I know my faith is strong (ah-ah)
I conquer all my enemies one by one (ah-ah)
Soon will be the day when we've overcome
Because I know my faith is strong (ah-ah)
I conquer all my enemies one by one
I know all will be well once again
We'll find victory in the end
I know all will be well once again
We'll find victory in the end
