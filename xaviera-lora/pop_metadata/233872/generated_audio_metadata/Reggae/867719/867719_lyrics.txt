Yeah when I was younger
Come on Joey we got a stickball game 12 o'clock
Yeah when I was younger
Aw man where is this guy he's always late
Yeah when I was younger
Oh there he goes now tell me he ot the bat
Yeah when I was younger
This guy is unbelievable
I tiptoed past your dad head
Snowing on the couch last night
I put a candle beside you
Snuck under your covers
And nibbled on your neck in each light
I heard a knock at the door
I picked my pants off the floor
As you was whispering to me stay out of sight
I was hanging out your window
Praying to God I would just survive that night
Yeah when I was younger
When I was younger
I lived life dangerously
Yeah when I was younger
When I was younger
Nobody told me about the birds and the bees
When I was younger, yeah when I was younger
I never landed on my feet
Yeah when I was younger, yeah when I was younger
I didn't think I'd make it to thirty
Hangin' out at the five and dime
A recipe for bad behavior
I took my baby for an ice cream
But back then they only had five flavors
I picked up a honey at 7-11 using my fake ID
Hanging by the bleachers, hiding from the teachers, playing hooky
When I was younger, when I was younger
You lost your temper and you started to shout
When I was younger, when I was younger
Your mommy didn't put you in time out
And when I was younger, and when I was younger
My daddy knocked my headlights out
And when I was younger, and when I was younger
You found an early work life so
A little younger, not so wise, but what did I see?
From my piece of property built for me in my tree
I got my first taste of how cruel life can be
When eminent domain took my treehouse from me
Could it be? (I thought I saw)
I knew it all, you couldn't talk to me
What looks so different then is so plain to see
If I'd have known back then what I know right now
Who knows what treasures I would have found
When I was younger, when I was younger
Major Nelson had his own genie
Yeah when I was younger
And when I was younger
You know the monsters were so scary
Yeah when I was younger
And when I was younger
I was eating dinner out of a TV
And when I was younger
And when I was younger
Hangin' out with Ralphie boy and our carnies
And when I was younger
Oh no no not another TV show based on reality
And when I was younger
Or a hip hop song with it's hook straight from 1970
Yeah when I was younger
Ayy there's a Hollywood producer
With a bright idea to remake an old movie
Yeah when I was younger
Yeah when I was younger
Man the judys were digging me
Yeah when I was younger
And now that I'm older
I gotta face the fact I'm not as sexy
