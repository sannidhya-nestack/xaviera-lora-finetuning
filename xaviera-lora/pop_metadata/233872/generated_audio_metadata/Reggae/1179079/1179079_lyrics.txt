Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
You and I have got a thing going on
What we've got is what many dream of
What we've got is very special
We found true loving and that's a blessing
We've gotta hold on, hold on
Hold on to the thing that we've got now baby
Hold on, hold on, hold on to the thing that we've got
For so long I've been looking around
Never thought I'd ever be found
It is so good just to have you around
A special one to call my own
We got to hold on
Hold on, hold on
Do the thing that we got now baby
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Do the thing that we got
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
We've gotta hold on, hold on
Hold on to the thing that we've got now, baby
Hold on, hold on, hold on to the thing that we've got now, oh baby
You've add some color to my world
With your loving, baby, yes you do
And I'm so glad that I found you
To give me loving baby that's so true
We've gotta hold on, gotta hold on, hold on to the loving that we've got
Hold on to the thing that we've got, no baby
Hold on, gotta hold on, hold on to the loving that we've got
Hold on to the thing that we've got
Hold on, hold on baby, hold on, hold on baby, hold on
To the thing that we got now baby, hold on, hold on baby, hold on, hold on baby, hold on
To the thing that we got
