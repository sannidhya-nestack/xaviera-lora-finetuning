Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So blue and bright
So deep and wild
The ocean in your eyes
Oh yeah
The ocean in your eyes
So deep and wild
The ocean in your eyes
And I dive deeper
Yeah I dive deeper
And I dive deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
So deep and wild
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Deeper (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah, I dive deeper
And I dive deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper (and I dive deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper)
Into the ocean in your eyes
And I jump into the ocean in the dark
I dive deeper and deeper and deeper and I dive deeper
And I dive deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
So blue and bright
So deep and wide
And I dive deeper
Yeah I dive deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper I dive deeper
And I dive deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
And I take a cool swim through your water world
Sun above us, deepness caught me in a whirl
Yeah, I'm soaking wet but you set me on fire
Drowning in your eyes, man, you're the beautifier
Yeah, on your water planet I found paradise
You're my paradise, you're my paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise
And I dive deeper
Yeah, I dive deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper I dive deeper
And I dive deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Oh
And I dive deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
And I dive deeper and deeper and deeper
And I dive deeper and deeper and deeper
