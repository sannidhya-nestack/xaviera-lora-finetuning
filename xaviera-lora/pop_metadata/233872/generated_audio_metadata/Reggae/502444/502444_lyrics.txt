Beverly's never gonna get any older
Combing her hair across her shoulder
Shouldn't have to be this way
Popping pills and running down the blues today
Do you remember the silent movie
How fast people fall in love and marry
You're taking time to cross the lines
And walking down the picket line of love today
No problem worth solving
You've got no reason to complain
No problem worth solving
You've got no reason to complain
Do you remember the silent movie
How fast people fall in love and marry
You're taking time to cross the line
Walking down the picket line of love today
No problem
Worth solving, you got no reason to complain
No problem, worth solving, you got no reason to complain
