Are the poor ones, yeah, dem a borrow from the World Bank and the IMF, oh yes, leave my people dem in a distress, it's a big mess, sugar dc, see ya, dem go borrow millions and billions and millions and more

Who do we beg for the God to round the clock protection
Millions and billions and millions and more
Still we nation under starvation
Total destruction going take we nation
Who do we beg for the God to round the clock
Well me know it's rough and tough when we are chatting of a billion
But them with them sixteen and them M1

We all know them move Jaguar in mash up them plan
True we no join them system nor anization

Dem want put we behind them rail and give you a sentence
Chat along my sister no make them change your plan
Chadadang my inbred and chant redemption song
That's the only song we have to re-re-nation
It a go rough, it a go tough, inna the samagidian
Under the fetish of the fetish shall stand
Well what is right cannot wrong
So is well rise and take your stand
Dem go borrow millions and billions and millions and more
Still we nation under starvation
Total destruction going take we nation
But if we beg father god be round the clock bro
Well all of them meek and the peacemakers and inherit the land
Blessed is the man who not well up in a rank
Just shall show mercy upon that man
Dem say different strokes to different folks
And different type of lyrics they fit different type of nation
Different type of argument fit different kind of frustration
Happy get dem thingy and have some anization
Rise up Ethiopia and take on us stand
Millions and billions and millions and more
Still we nation under starvation
Total destruction going take we nation
Who no fi beg for the God fi round the clock
Well travel up, travel down through the jumps of the rain just to save my soul
Them have it at range, Jah control me brain and Him control me soul
God have everything under control
Nuff man a act mighty, full and bold
Running down diamond, silver and gold

Total destruction go and take we nation
Who do fi beg father God fi roll di clock protection
Millions and billions and millions and more
