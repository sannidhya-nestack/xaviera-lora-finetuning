Hear my feeling iron out
I went to Jamaica and I wanna go back
I went to Jamaica and I wanna go back
I went to Jamaica and I wanna go back
I went to Jamaica and I want to go back
I met a pretty girl down Jamaica way
Her eyes were so blue like the sky in May
She was a pretty girl with a beech and tan
She could make any guy a happy man
So I went to Jamaica and I wanna go back
I went to Jamaica and I wanna go back
I went to Jamaica and I wanna go back
I went to Jamaica and I wanna go back
Am I feeling irie now?
I miss the warm ocean and the summer breeze
And the sandy beaches with the large palm trees
Sailing out over to Montego Bay
I'm gonna come back here again someday
I went to Jamaica and I wanna go back
I went to Jamaica and I want to go back
I went to Jamaica and I want to go back
I went to Jamaica and I want to go back
Am I feeling irate?
I've been to Jamaica, can't wait to go back
I've gone to Jamaica and I'd love to go back
I've seen sweet Jamaica and I hope to go back
I could stay in Jamaica and never come back
I'ma stay in Jamaica and never come back
