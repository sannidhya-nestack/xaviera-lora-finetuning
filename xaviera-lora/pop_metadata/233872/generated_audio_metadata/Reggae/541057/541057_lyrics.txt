The simple mind says that it's up to you
Rising on up to the endless blue
That falls from the sky down into the sea
So take it on back cause it feels good to me
Making it happen
Making it happen
Watching for you is all I can do
Watching for me eventually be
Spreading the love people are due
Working it all as it's coming for you
The light is far and it's falling for me
Making it rise up into the sea
Watching for you is all I can see
Watching for me eventually be
Making it happen, making it happen, yeah
The quiet man says that it's up to you
Rising up through the endless blue
That falls from the sky down into the sea
So take it on back cause it feels good to me
Making it happen

Watching for you is all I can see
Watching for me eventually be
Spreading the love all the people I do
Working it all as it's coming for you
The light is caught and it's falling for me
Making it as I step into the sea
Watching for you is all I can do
Watching for me eventually be
Making it happen
Making it happen, yeah
The noble man says that it's up to you
Rising up to the endless blue
