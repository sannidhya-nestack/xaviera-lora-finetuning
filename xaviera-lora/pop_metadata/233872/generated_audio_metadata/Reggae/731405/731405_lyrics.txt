What?
Reggae rhythm in a taboua style
Get up, get up, come dance tonight
Reggae rhythm in a taboua style
We'll make you feel alright
Feel it beating in your soul's worthwhile
Mash up, mash up, dance through the night
Move your body in a kingside style
We'll make you feel alright
Feel this vibe, it's rolling harder
We knows where we're ranking
Proper skanking as the DJ turns it up
Feel this vibe, it's rolling harder
We knows where we're ranking
Proper skanking as the DJ turns it up
Feeling freedom in your heart tonight
You are, you are all mine tonight
I am looking at you in the eye
Feeling good vibes
Music pounding all around right now
Bang up, bang down on the dance floor
Jairus the furry cuts down the vibes
Tonight we will unite
Feel this vibe, it's rolling harder
We knows where we ranking
Proper skanking as the DJ turns it up
Feel this vibe, it's rolling harder
We knows where we ranking
Proper skanking as the DJ turns it up
I'm a bad boy, I'm a bad boy, I'm a bad boy, I'm a bad boy, I'm a bad boy
Feel this vibe, it's rolling harder
We knows where we're ranking
Proper skanking as the DJ turns it up
Feel this vibe, it's rolling harder
We knows where we're ranking
Proper skanking as the DJ turns it up
