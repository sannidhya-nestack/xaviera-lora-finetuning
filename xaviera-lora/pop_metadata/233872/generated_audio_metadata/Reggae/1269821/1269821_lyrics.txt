In the book of Genesis we're told
God created woman for man to hold
He created animals to please our eyes
All things great or small that walk, grows or flies
Ali and Buddha were vegetarians, you know it's true
Gandhi and Muhammad they were too
These wise men they all understood
That all life is blessed and is good
Be kind to all creatures great or small
Those that fly or walk or crawl
Like a snake, bird or kangaroo
They all feel and love like we do
For they all feel and love like we do, like we do
Like we knew
All those blood-clad hunters with their big guns
Each with small puppies, everyone
Showing their man by killing for fun
Burn in hell, more fear everyone
More for your everyone
Never hurt an animal
Show them that you're kind
Animals are lovable
Give them all your love and time
Give them all your love and time
Because you're animals
When you walk on the street
Look ahead in front of your feet
Don't tread on anything alive
For all creatures want to survive
No matter how big, small, fat or thin
Every animal has feelings within
Every atom that's filled with them
Haile and Buddha were vegetarians, you know it's true
Gandhi and Mohammed they were too
These wise men all understood
That all life is blessed and is good
All life is blessed and is good
In the book of Genesis we're told
In the book of Genesis we are told
God created woman for man to hold
Created woman for man to hold
We created animals to please our eyes (to please our eyes)
All things great are small and walk rows of lines (hey)
I would have a vegetarian, you know it's true
Gandhi and Muhammad they were two
These wise men they all understood
That all life is blessed and is good
Ah
Inna demorrow, bless up, bless up, bless up
Inna demorrow, inna demorrow, inna demorrow
Inna demorrow
Bless us in our tomorrow
