Ooh yeah
Ooh la la la la la la la
I admit that I'm not perfect
Not perfect
No no no no no no
We've all had some good times
But love they say is never perfect
But we got to work our way through it
I admit it I have made some mistakes
But what is love without iveness
What if you truly love me baby
Don't call it quits, stick with me girl, yeah
So if you love me
You better stick with me
If you love me
You gotta stick with me
If you love me
You gotta stick with me
If you love me
You gotta stick with me
Stick with me
See, I'm a work in progress, I agree
But tell me who is perfect, baby
Love is beautiful but it takes two
Take my hand and let's just work this out
You gotta know that I will always love you
And I will always treat you right
But I'm not perfect
I'm not perfect (I'm not perfect)
And if you love me like you said
Stick with me girl
Stick with me
Stick with me
If you love me
You've gotta stick with me if you love me
You've gotta stick with me if you love me
You've gotta stick with me if you love me
You've gotta stick with me
You've gotta know that I will always love you
And I will always dream to rise
But I'm not perfect
I'm not perfect
