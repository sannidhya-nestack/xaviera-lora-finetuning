It's true what they say
I guess it's true what they say
We spend our whole life searching for love
But we would know when it hits us in the face
True love, true love, true love
You said you wanted a man who would love you for who you are wholeheartedly
Here I am
Well here I am
So why you running away from me
Why you running away from me
Why you running away from me
From me
So here I am
Here I am
Here I am baby
Don't run away from me
Don't walk away from me
Don't run away from true love
It took so long to get here girl
Why you wanna throw it all away
All I did was love you
Love you was all I did baby
Tell me what was my crime, girl
You said all your life you never had someone
Who loved you more than me
Here I am
I gave you my heart
Gave you my body and soul
I guess it wasn't enough
If not
So why are you running away from me?
Why are you running away?
From there, from there, here I am
