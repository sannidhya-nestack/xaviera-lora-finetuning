Chasing rainbows, looking for a pot of gold
Chasing shadows when the trail's going cold
When I met you, you were searching for a love that couldn't break apart
When love ain't'round the corners, babe, it's right here in my heart
No more breaking news from my love babe (from my love)
Gonna tie the knot real tight babe (real tight)
No more breaking news from my love (from my love)
I'm gonna tie the knot real tight babe (real tight)
No use running
I'll catch up to you
No use hiding
I won't rest until I find you
Then I'll show you dedication
And I won't take no for an answer
There's nowhere left to run to, babe
Come on home
Come on home
No more breaking loose
From my love (from my love)
Gonna tie the knot real tight, babe (real tight)
No more breaking news from my love (from my love)
Gonna tie the knot tight, tight, babe (real tight)
No use lying, the truth is what I'm after
No use crying,'cause I can turn your tears to laughter
I have enough love to keep us together
And I will protect you babe, now and forever
No more breaking up, no more, no more from my love
Gonna tie the noose real tight babe (real tight)
No more breaking loose
Oh I'm gonna keep you close (from my love) yeah
Gonna tie the noose
You're not gonna get away (real tight) no
No more breaking loose (no more, no more, no) from my love
Gonna try the new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, n-o-o-o-o-o-o, n-o-o-o-o, new, new, n-o-o, new, n-o, n, n-o, n, n, n-o, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n
