She wore a short skirt (short skirt)
She had black and white shoes (black and white shoes)
When I looked at her (looked at her)
Cause I wanted to touch her hair
Anywhere
We knew from the start
We were meant to be apart
Red eye which is hurt
Cause I wanted to touch her hair
We were riding in a Range Rover
Being like grow up
Pop your feet off the ground
Not making a sound
Cause I wanted to touch her hair
Anywhere
Cause all I wanted to touch your hair
