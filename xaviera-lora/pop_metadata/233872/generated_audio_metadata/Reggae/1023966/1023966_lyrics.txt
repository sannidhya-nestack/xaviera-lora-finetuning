I got the sun up above in the deep blue sky
I got the moon and the stars at night
I got love in my life and enough to get by
Yeah everything's alright
I got a place to lay my head and enough to eat
I got a song to sing
I must have angels up above I may never meet
Sometimes I feel like complaining
I get to thinking only'bout myself
Then I realize more won't make me
As happy as being there for someone else
I got the sun up above in the deep blue sky
I got the moon and the stars at night
I got love in my life and enough to get by
Yeah everything's alright
I got a place to lay my head and enough to eat
I got a song to sing
I must have angels up above I may never meet
I got a friend who wants to know what's in it for him
What has anyone done for him lately?
I told him you got it backwards, it's not about you
Just look at all the things you could do
You got the sun up above in the deep blue sky
You got the moon and the stars at night
You got love in your life and enough to get by
Yeah everything's alright
You got a place to lay your head and enough to eat
You got a song to sing
You must have angels up above you may never meet
Watching over you
We can help a little here and help a little there
We can smile more and show that we care
We can ease someone's burden in little ways
We don't have to do it all to make someone's day
We got the sun up above and the deep blue sky
We got the moon and the stars at night
We got love in our lives and enough to get by yeah everything's alright
We got a place to lay our heads and enough to eat
We got a song to sing
We must have angels up above we may never meet
Watching over us
We must have angels up above we may never meet
Watching over us
