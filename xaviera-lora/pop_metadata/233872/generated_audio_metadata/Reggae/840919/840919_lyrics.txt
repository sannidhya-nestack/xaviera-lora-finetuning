I want you as my Tarzan and I'll be your Jane
Take me by your loving arms
And save me from pain
Like no other man I know
You raise me up when I am low
I want you always by my side
When I feel I'm riding on a runaway train
You give me peace down deep inside
And make me feel sane
You're like no other man I know
You raise me up when I am low
I want you always by my side
Take me away where people can't hurt me
Hold me close against your heart
Promise me you'll stay and never go away
I want you always by my side
I want you always by my side
Take me away where people can't hurt me
Hold me close against your heart
Promise me you'll stay and never go away
I want you always by my side
I want you as my Tarzan and I'll be your Jane
Take me by your loving arms
And save me from pain
You're like no other man I know
You raise me up when I am low
How won't you always by my side
I want you always by my side, by my side
I want you always by my side, by my side
I want you always by my side, raise me up
I want you always by my side, you're like no other man
I want you always by my side
