On and on
So real
Together
Ooh
Emotions
Ooh
Of my life
Ooh
I
Then you're not together
Somewhat stronger, stronger
Shared with me
Ooh
Affection
Ooh
You make all
Ooh
Of my life
Ooh, I need your love
Can't destroy, feel for you
In my heart, just for you, for you
Those moments
Moments of love
Vibrations
Ooh
Of my life
Ooh, I'm in your love
