Go home
The sun is high, it's so bright
Feels so good, feels just right
Cool breeze, sways the trees
In my head, I pop dreams
Life is sweet, summer heat
Move my feet to the beat
In the sand, old and bent
We are free, just you and me
Like ice in the sunshine
We're melting away
Love's so warm, here we'll stay
Ooh, like ice in the sunshine
We dance and we play
Summer love, day by day
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Reggae vibes, hearts alive
Rhythm flows, we arrive
In the light, hold me tight
Everything's gonna be alright
Feel the warmth in the air
Happy moments we share
Sunset glow, love will show
Together we'll go, we'll go
Like lights in the sunshine
We're melting away
Love's so warm, here we stay, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like ice in the sunshine, we dance and we play
Summer love, day by day, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Reggae vibes, hearts alive
Rhythm flows, we arrive in the light
Hold me tight, everything's gonna be alright
Feel the warmth in the air
Happy moments we share
Sunset glow, love will show
Together we'll go, we'll go
Like ice in the sunshine
We're melting away
Love so warm, here we'll stay
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like lights in the sunshine
We dance and play
Summer love, day by day
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
