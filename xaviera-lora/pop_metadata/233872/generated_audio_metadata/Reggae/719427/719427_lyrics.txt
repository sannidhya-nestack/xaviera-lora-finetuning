Sailing away through a tropical day
Out at sea, just you and me
Sailing away, watch the dolphins play
Feeling free, the whales agree
A soft summer breeze
Moves our sails with ease
Giving us a peaceful ride
You by my side
Sailing away
Feel the ocean spray
A sea world below
Creatures we know
Sailing away, see a bright blue jay
Flying to its nest, man we're blessed
There's this peace of mind
Seagulls flying behind
Past a sunken pirate ship
What a pleasant trip
(audience laughing)
Sailing away down a tranquil bay
The island's in view, the beach is too
Sailing away, see the palm trees sway
Let's enjoy the sun and have some fun
It's a dream come true
Paradise for two
So relax, take in the sight
And the starry night
