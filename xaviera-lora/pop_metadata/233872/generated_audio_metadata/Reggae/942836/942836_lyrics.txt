Smoke weed all the time
Smoke it until the heat's gone
Until the heat's gone
Until he's gone
Some call it marijuana and some call it Mary Jane
Some call it Saint-Semenya that sweet cool champagne
No matter what you call it I feel good in my brain
And get me so high but never go insane
Pass me a couple zigzags and some grubba that's fine
And now that weed is legal I smoke it all the time
Pass me a lighter let me spark up the spleen
I don't want no other drugs, give me a hit of that
Give me the ganja
You know what I'm talking about
I want the highest grade that you can ever find
Give me that OG purple coach to ease up my mind
I want pineapple sour want them northern lights
It nearly lick me head but take me to higher high
Some people take it as a medicine for ease them pain
They say that it kill cancer of the lungs and brain
Some people like for eat a dinner brownies and tea
No matter how you like it, just give us a little bang
Jermaine Inoue on the beats
That's right
We're gonna get down and dirty
Smoking a little bit, yeah
Tell you what I wanna do today
I'ma pick up a brick and light a way
Got a kinder or a seedless way
I'ma smoke old school all week, no kind
Cocaine, that's your bitch
I got Jane Hocken
In the back with the chat with my name
We be riding kinda high so I might zig zag through your land uh
Let me tell it how it is when I spit it
I'ma get ill on the mic in a minute
Or pass me the weed that ain't got no seed in it
I'ma get cold like I'm Stalin or Lenin
Communist joke I didn't think you would get it
Left handed cigarette
Do I smoke that weed? I don't give a fuck what they say
I smoke that weed all day (give me the guns up)
Watch it up, I'ma fly like Amado Carrillo, señor de los cielos, I'm flyin' away (you know what you're talkin' about)
Do I smoke that weed? I don't give fuck what they say
I smoke that weed all day (yeah, yeah, yeah)
No mind, then up, I'ma fly like Amado Carrillo, señor de los cielos, I'm flyin' away
Money, I don't wanna wake up but a fatty got me feelin' almighty like Gandhi
Lit that shit up and went laughin' about it
ot to go to work, then got fired
Smoked some more weed then recorded about it
Up in the mic with a rose on my finger
Now I'm runnin' low
Just enough to roll a tenner
Chocolate cake for dinner
And lucky for me the girl I'm banging is my dealer
Can't help the noise, round up the noise
Cover the voice in my head of the noise
Down with the voice and I carry my joint
No matter how you like it just give us a little vent
I smoke that weed (I don't give a fuck what they say)
I smoke that weed all day (throw my gin up, I'ma fly like Amado Carrillo, Señor de los Cielos, I'm flyin' away)
I smoke that weed (I don't give a fuck what they say)
I smoke that weed all day (throw my gin up, I'ma fly like Amado Carrillo, Señor de los Cielos, I'm flyin' away)
Smoke weed all the time
Smoke it until it leaves my mind
Until it leaves my mind
Until it leaves my
Smoke it all the time
Smoke it until it eats your mind
Until it eats your mind
Until it eats
Smoke it all the time
Smoke it until it eats your mind
Until it eats your mind
Until they ease up
Basically I'm in love with the weed
Mama done raised a hippie and me
And I gotta be true to the tree
Don't do the coke man I stick to the green
Yes I'm strictly dickly
Sticking faithful to that sticky-icky
Filthy little bitches waiting for her kiss and hickey
