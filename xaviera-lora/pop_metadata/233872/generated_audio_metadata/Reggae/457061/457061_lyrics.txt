Tell him it's time to leave the bar there and bring come on in
I shoot the papa walking and I ready for a night
You better knock me down before you can get any of my ground
And this is what I say to make you see I
You better knock me down before you can get any of my ground
And this is what I say to make you see I don't beg
And this is what I say
To make you see it
Tell yourself to read the Bible, you're a freak, come on in
You better knock me down
Before you can get any of my ground
And this is what I say
To make you see I don't break
And this is what I say
I'm a hoodlip, I'ma walk in and I read the program
You better knock me down before you can get any of my ground
And this is what I say to make you see I don't bend
