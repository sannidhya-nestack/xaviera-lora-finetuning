Matics, dangerous, dangerous, dangerous
Romantics changes us, awaken us
It changes us, enable us
Dangerous, created us, enable us
They're not afraid for boss, Matics

Reciprocity that's my philosophy
Helps to maintain my velocity
Leaving no more room for animosity
This the dichotomy
If you try to bother me
Then just run and hide in me
Study them, study them
Watch them like, ah
Study them, study them
Don't be dummy, dummy
Don't play buddy, buddy
Dit, dit, dit, dit

Dangerous, can't conquer us
Dem no afraid fi boss
Look fi cancel us, ah
Higher back if you watch, nothing jam that cardiac heart attack ain't nobody order that
Kick in the back door, circle the Ras core and all the jam war
Brandish the hammer and mash them like Thor
Call me the matador with the lightsaber from Star Wars and or
Send on the head them straight tilt Ecuador
Angering them in history like folklore
Dangerous, ready if them want more
Dangerous, ready ready if them want more
Listen while you hear some slime
Some grind, push into high gear
Day time, night time
Analyze how dem interfere
Like William Shakespeare
Watch a man and your friend dem dem
Dem dem okie mokie
Dem dem okie mokie
Watch a track where dem send send send
Wampidopidopi

Yam that cardiac heart attack
Ain't nobody order that, dangerous, can't conquer us

Ain't nobody order that, dramatics, dramatics, dramatics
