Be, baby, be
Oh gosh, no, no, no, no, no
Aye, aye, aye
Aye, aye, yo (Why, why, why not?)
Not right, not right, not right again
Again, again, again
Mm-mm-mm
Aye-ee-ee-ee-ee
Ooh-wee
Why, why, why, why
Be bright and be
Oh gosh, oh no
Just a little bit of cha-cha blessing
First thing in the morning
Will make me feel so strong
First thing in the morning
Will keep me going on
Keep me going
I get up everyday
Hold my head up high
Aiming for the sky (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We gotta push and chew (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
In everything we do (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
And do the best we can (yeah, yeah)
Just a little bit of cha-cha blessing
First thing in the morning
Will make me feel so strong
Mmm, just a little bit of churchillessin'
First thing in the morning
We'll keep you going strong (keep me going)
First in the morning I give you thanks and praise
For the good is done for me and how me cares for me
One taste more of this blessing forevermore
On what a day will be when I'm on chassis
We keep on building, chop low, flood and catch the sea
I have blessings for the righteous, more light for the weak
Make you a damn good spy but
This can't substitute my salvation
He's my light and shield
But I'm not to feel my guide and shield
He's just free will
But now the shouting loud is such a blessing
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
Just a little bit of church a blessing
First thing in the morning
Will keep you going strong (keep me going)
I know the work it up
But we get we won
We get to stand up fair
The back could maybe rest
Sometimes it gets so tough
We got to keep on fightin'
Oh what a day will be when I'm on chassis
Rake it up, build and drop low flat and catch the feed
I have blessings for the righteous, more life for the meek
Make it worth them cost by both
This Kansas the giant is salvation
He's my light and shield
For the man to feel, my guide and shield
He's just free will
But not just shoutin' loud, it's such a blessing
Na na na na now
Na na na na na now, yeah
Just a little bit of church
Just a little bit of cha-cha lesson
First thing in the morning
Will keep you going strong
Just a little bit of cha-cha lesson
First thing in the morning
Will keep me going on
Keep me going
Just a little bit of cha-cha lesson
First thing in the morning will keep you going strong
