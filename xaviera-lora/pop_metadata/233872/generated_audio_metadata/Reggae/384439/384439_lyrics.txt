Contemplating life
And the whole package deal that comes with it
It's all a bunch of shit
I hope I don't last too long if I stay this way
Cause I know that life ain't no temporary
One is the right way to find another day
Stuck here waiting for so long (waiting for so long)
Think I'm headed straight down
Dive strapped into the ground
Think never have I been so wrong
What is the right way to have fun in the night or day?
Suck your weight in for so long (when it goes wrong)
Stick your head in straight down, cause I'll smack you to the ground
Never have I been so wrong
Contemplating life, yeah no package deal that comes with it
It's all a bunch of shit
I hope I don't last too long if I say it this way
Cause I know that life ain't no damn parade
Play your music to the pick snaps
et the click tracks
Power chords blastin'
Smash your mom's knick knacks
Gankin' it but you ain't ratin' it or rankin' it
I'm a real cool guy and there's no debating it
Puck and Scott seen a way in this verse to verse
Ponce and Porsche Studios in your face first
It's a little jittery
What is the right way to find another Jake?
I stalked here waiting for someone (waiting for someone)
Think I ran it straight down, got slapped into the ground
Never have I been so wrong
