There must be better words to say
To find more love in every way
We must find better words to say
To find more love in every way
Angels in heaven are calling
Calling our name
Angels in heaven are watching us
Paradise is not that far away
The more love you give the more come your way
Paradise is not that far away
The more peace you give the more come your way
Angels in heaven are calling
Calling our name
Angels in heaven are watching us
More love, more love
It's got to be more love
More love
More love
It's got to be more love
It's time to listen to our pleas
It's time we get down on our knees
We can do better than we know
Just plant the seed and watch it grow
Angels in heaven are calling
Calling our name
Angels in heaven are watching us
Moan love
Moan love
There's got to be more love
More love
More love
There's got to be more love
There's got to be more love
Well there's got to be
I'm on love
I'm on love
Yeah there's got to be (there must be better words)
Got to be more love (there must be better words)
There's got to be (there must be better words)
Got to be more love
