One, two, three, ho
Yeah, girl you're good for me
Just the way you are
You're good for me
Just the way you are
I know you see them on the magazine
The picture on the TV screen
They're ridin' in a limousine
But that's not real to me
Their hair was never out of place
They got such style and grace
So perfect that you can't believe
But that's not real to me
I want a girl that doesn't always have her makeup on
Can you hear what I'm trying to say, woah
Someone who can't go out with sneakers and some blue jeans on
You ain't gotta look your best all day, girl
I like your hair, I like your eyes
Your skin feels nice, girl I think you're fine
You ain't gotta change a thing, don't change a thing
But baby from what I can see, you're good for me
Yeah, you're good for me (you're good for me)
Just the way you are (you're good for me)
Girl, you're good for me (you're good for me)
Just the way you are
You see the model on the runway walking down
Weighing about 98 pounds
Dressed in a twenty thousand dollar gown
But that's not real to me
At the party so everyone can see
Hanging with other celebrities
Strike a pose for the paparazzi
But that's not real to me
I want a girl that doesn't always have her makeup on
Can you hear what I'm trying to say?
Woah
Someone who can't go out with sneakers and some blue jeans on
Cause you ain't gotta look your best all day, girl
I like your hair, I like it, I like your eyes, yes I do
Your skin feels nice, girl I think you're fine
You ain't gotta change a thing, no no, don't change a thing
The best part I can see, you're good for me
You're good for me (You're good for me)
Just the way you are, baby (You're good for me)
You're so good for me (You're good for me)
Oh, just the way you are (You're good for me)
I said, you're good
