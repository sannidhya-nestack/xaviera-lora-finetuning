Oh man dem will not get the love you endlessly care and done, you know
Love you excess amount so it be on for the ground
Cause this I love you I care and done, watch this
I would a never stop crying
If you ever leave I would a never stop crying
You think a way my breath I would a never stop crying
If you ever leave I would a never stop crying
I would never stop crying
I would a never stop crying
If you ever leave I would I never stop crying
You think away my breath I would I never stop crying
If you ever leave I would I never stop crying
I would never stop crying
Remember when we used to mash up off a tree bark
Write up with names pon the walls with all a blue chalk
A drink from the same bottle with the screw cock
When every man you passed one you be them sweet heart
A go inna the pot pot while off a jump start
A took you to a restaurant them said they lunch hot
Dem a bad mind wid dem cause dem have dumb thoughts
The only thing dem can do is just talk
Cause woman a woulda never stop crying
If you ever leave a woulda never stop crying
You take away my breath a woulda never stop crying
If you ever leave a woulda never stop crying
Now never stop crying a woulda never stop crying
If you ever leave a woulda never stop crying
You take away my breath a woulda never stop crying
If you ever leave a woulda never stop crying
Cry now, never stop crying
Well everyday dem get up on the same thing
I gotta blind dem through dem see how it dey ring
Live in a glass house no stone no flipling
Big as the stone that one day will rock your wing
Latte a stouter she know me never want her
See way to get down I'ma call it a hunter
Dress in a short shorts and I come a flanter
Just make sure you know me and I would never part
Cause woman a woulda never stop crying
If you ever leave I would a never stop crying
You think a way more better would a never stop crying
If you ever leave I would a never stop crying
I would never stop crying I would a never stop crying
If you ever leave I would a never stop crying
You think a way more better would a never stop crying
If you ever leave I would a never stop crying
I would never stop crying
You coke up out a brown skinna dat a kill dem
Dem coulda day come a hear you a den knock your grill dem
You no keep dem free friend cause dem a hidden
Dem a push up in your way but a flee dem
Love how you sexy and round in all your jeans dem
Skin clean because in your mouth all your greens dem
Not mention your bank and your butter beans dem
I wish I den get truth on all your screens dem
I woulda never stop crying
If you ever leave I would a never stop crying
You take away my breath I would a never stop crying
If you ever leave I would a never stop crying
I would never stop crying I would a never stop crying
If you ever leave I would a never stop crying
You take away my breath I would a never stop crying
If you ever leave I would I never stop crying I'll never stop crying
Remember when we used to mash up off a three pack
Write up we names pon the walls with all a blue chart
A drink from the same bottle we dis crew pack
When every man a boss why you be dem sweet act
A tour inna di pod but we off a jump start
A took you to a restaurant dem said they lunch at
Dem a bad mind we dunka dem have dum tart
The only thing dem can do is just start
Cause woman a would a never stop crying
If she ever leave a would a never stop crying
You think a way my rent a would a never stop crying
If she ever leave a would a never stop crying
A who never stop crying a would a never stop crying
If she ever leave a would a never stop crying
You think a way my rent a would a never stop crying
If you ever leave I woulda never stop crying, I woulda never stop crying
Well everyday dem get up on the same thing
A datta blind dem true dem see how we dey ring
Live in a glass house no stone no fae fling
Because the stone that one day will break your wing
I woulda never stop crying
If you ever leave I woulda never stop crying
