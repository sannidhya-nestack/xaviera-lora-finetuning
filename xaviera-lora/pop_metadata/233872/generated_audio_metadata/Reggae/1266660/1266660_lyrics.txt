I was walking down the street, a sad man's fella came up to me
I told him something face to face, said the same thing I tell myself every day
Stuff happens, life's not perfect, one day you're up and next you're down
Keep trying, keep on smiling, that's the way the world goes round
Don't give in too fast, cloudy days won't last
Tell yourself, this too shall pass
When the world becomes too much
Always have a heart full of love
If you see a sad lonely face
Say the same thing I tell myself everyday
Stuff happens, life's not perfect
One day you're up, the next you're down
Keep trying, keep on smiling
That's the way the world goes round
Don't give in too fast
Cloudy days won't last
Tell yourself
This doom shall pass
When the world becomes too much
Always have a heart full of love
If you see a sad lonely face
Say the same thing I tell myself everyday
Stuff happens, life's not perfect
One day you're up, the next you're down
Keep trying, keep on smiling
That's the way the world goes round
Don't give in too fast
Cloudy days won't last
Tell yourself
This too shall pass
When the world becomes too much
Always have a heart full of love
If you see a sad lonely face
Say the same thing I tell myself everyday
Don't give in too fast
Cloudy days won't last
Tell yourself
This too shall pass
