Yo, like the late great Michael Jackson said
We are the world, we are the children
So let's protect them, don't neglect them
Seed what you reap and the seed what you sow
Protect the little children and see them grow
We'll teach a little youth them so they shall know
That them heart a fi clean and pure like the rainbow
The seed what you reap and the seed what you sow
Protect the little children and see them grow
Up on the wrong pathway, tell them to no go
And straight from the path they were straight and narrow
Don't be no predator, treat them like no prey
Just be them life editor, no lead them astray
So stop all literal abuse, there's no excuse
For your act and your attitude
Show them the way, set them speed and their attitude
Now I no hear no news but no youth, they what mama lose
Yo, build them little children and they'll lead us for tomorrow
No teaching but no pain, no teaching but no sorrow
The seed where you reap and the seed where you sow
Protect the little children and see them grow
We'll teach a little youth them so they shall know
That them heart a fi clean and pure like the rainbow
The seed where you reap and the seed where you sow
Protect the little children and see them grow
Up on the wrong pathway tell them straight no go
And a straight from the path they walk straight on a hoe
Full time we burn out all the pedophiles
When you see them there's no hesitation on the red fire
The laws of the land dem a go on like dem want defy
Future of the little children, remember try deny
But don't you know that anytime that you come anna
A fire lay dem, yo
Remember say that you no stop from destroy an
Annihilate them, yo
Why don't you love and care them (care them)
Inside you want to shove and tear them (tear them)
No let no child molester come near them (near them)
Yo, inna the right direction you better steer them (steer them)
We got to protect we little si me and toya
Co' dem coulda grow to be we doctor and lawyer
Nobody coulda come and try to destroy ya
Got to protect we little girl and boy ya
Seed where ya reap and the seed where ya sow
Protect the little children and see them grow
We'll teach a little you them so they shall know
That them heart a fi clean and pure like the rainbow
The seed where you reap a the seed where you sow
We touch the little children and see them grow
Up on the wrong pathway tell them better go
And a straight from the path they was straight and narrow
So many peace out the street dem discreet
So be careful how you meet and not greet
Some a smile show dem teeth but underneath dem ne fleece
Dem a beat another beat show dem evil to the peak
Run off a dem a preach show dem weak dem a freak
Instead a teach dem a play hide and seek
Which enough you on your knees you na see it inna times like these
You always a afraid of death and your cues and ways
Cause I don't wanna see no children a die
And I don't wanna hear about no children a cry just why
You can't give them a play
No tell them nothing but no deny
Me say you can't even trust your own shadow after dark
Not for them me say say them no stop sky lock
Tell them negativity don't you take part
After they be picking in them clothes to be hard
The seed what you reap and the seed what you sow
Protect the little children and see them grow
We'll teach the little youth them so they shall know
That them heart have to clean and pure like the rainbow
The seed what you reap and the seed what you sow
Protect the little children and see them grow
Up on the wrong pathway tell them say no go
And straight from the path they were straight and narrow
Seed what you sow
See them grow
Tell them say no go
Much better than a rope
Seed for your soul
See them grow
Let nothing of go
