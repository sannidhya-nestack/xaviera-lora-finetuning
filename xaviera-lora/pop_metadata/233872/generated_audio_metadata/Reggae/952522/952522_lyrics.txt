You'll be cruisin'
You'll be cruisin' now and then
You'll be losin'
You'll be losin' then you win
You see it every day
You know it's not the way it should be
You need the great escape
Just not through the gates
It's easy, yeah
You be thinking as you're drinking it's for me
It be better and the weather I agree
The night and hideaway
The place that you can stay now and whenever
We'd like to know your name
The reason why you came
So collect this treasure
Take it back to the start of your memory
People happy you choose who you wanna see
Wear the clothes that you want share on holiday
See the sights yes they will take your breath away
You'll be cruising
You'll be back right here again
Don't be fooling
You're still waiting here my friend
Just a couple of weeks
Land upon your feet
Just like it should be
Don't have to think or hope
Do as they do on road
It's good to be free
