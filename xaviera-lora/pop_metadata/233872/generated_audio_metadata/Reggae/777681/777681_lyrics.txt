Katie arrived in the city today
She hopped out the bus and she said no way
She asked who I was from, a surfer named Jackson
He wound it all up and said I gotta say ah
Na na na na na na
Da da do da day
We're going to the party
We'll celebrate today
Now purple bees
Teenage dreams
Falling to the street
With whistle shot
No us arching dreams
They got off the bus at the record store
They ran up the stairs to the bungalow
She got a whip up at Julian's stage
And said man that's great but I gotta go
Na na na na na na
Da da do da day
We're going to the party
We'll celebrate today
Now purple beets
Teenage dreams
Fall into the stream
With whistle sharp
Noah's Ark in dream
I saw Katie dishing down in Haiti
Said whatever happened to you little beau?
She said Jackson is in the tent packing
We're heading up to Reading to eat la lo
Na na na na na na
Da da do da day
We're going to the party
We'll celebrate today
Now purplebeef, teenage dreams
Falling to the street
With width so sharp, Noah's Ark in dream
