Danja di moda land, under di naik stars
Ancient voices whisper tales from afar
With di turn ai open, we see di past unfold
Stories of the ancients, the mysteries untold
Oh motherland, under the night sky
The spirits dance as the night stars fly
Ancient wisdom in every stone and tree
Inna di motherland we feel so free
In the heart of Africa where the rhythms beat
Voices of the elders in every street
They tell of kingdoms lost and empires spran
In the motherland we still feel their hand
Oh motherland under the night sky
The spirits dance as the night stars fly
Ancient wisdom in every stone and tree
Inna di motherland we feel so free
I'm at the night sky
The spirits dance as the night stars fly
Ancient wisdom in every stone and tree
Inna di motherland we feel so free
So let the drum beat guide us through the night
Inna di motherland we find our light
With the third eye open we see the way
Ancient stories guide us to a brighter day
From the pyramids of Egypt to the savannah's wide
The muddy motherland we feel the ancient wrath
Oh motherland, under the night skies
The spirits dance as the night stars fly
Ancient wisdom in every stone and tree
Inna di motherland we feel so free
Under the night sky
The spirits dance as the night stars thrive
Ancient wisdom in every stone and tree
In our motherland we feel so free
