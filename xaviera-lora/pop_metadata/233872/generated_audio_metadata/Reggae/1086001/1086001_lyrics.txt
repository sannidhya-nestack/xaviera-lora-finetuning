I'm a wanderer every night
Setting voice throughout the skies
Never turning from the right
I'm a wanderer every night
Setting voice throughout the skies
Never turning from the right
Looking round every corner
I've got a passion
I'm on like a dragon, eh
Fight like desire
Find a place to take me higher
I'm a wonder every night
Setting voice throughout the skies
Never turning from the right
I'm a wander every night
Setting voice throughout the skies
Never turning from the right
Give you a ride
You can be my guide (I am, I, I)
Show me somethin', somethin' new (I'm a lover)
And I'll say, "I do"
And I'll protect you from nobody
And all my love, all my love
You can keep, you can keep, you can keep
You can keep
Come on now, now I know it's only you and I, oh
Show me something new, and I'll say I do
I'm a wanderer every night
Setting voice throughout the skies
Never turning from the right
I'm a wanderer every night
Setting voyage throughout the skies
Never turning from the right
