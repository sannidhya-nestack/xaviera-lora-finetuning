Soft reggae music playing
Lovers vibes they must saying
Find your girl for last dance
The night is nearly over
Her head lay on your shoulder
As she hugged you, you hold her real tight
Less chance for the less dance (less chance)
Less chance for the less dance (less chance)
Less chance for the less chance
For feeling high
Less chance for the less dance (less chance)
Less chance for the less dance (less chance)
Less chance for the less chance
For feeling high
Soft reggae music playing
Lovers vibes they must say in
Find your girl for last dance
The night is nearly over
Her head lay on your shoulder
As she huggles you hold her real tight
Last chance, it's your last chance
Last chance for feeling irie
The night is nearly over
Her head lay on your shoulder
She huggles, you hold her real tight
(Last chance)
Last chance for the last dance (Last chance)
Last chance for the last dance (Last chance)
Last chance for the last chance for feeling irie
Last chance for the last dance (Last chance)
Last chance for the last dance (Last chance)
Last chance for feeling irie, irie, irie
Last chance, it's your last chance
Last chance for feeling irate
Last chance (last chance)
Last chance (last chance)
Last chance for feeling irate
Less chance (less chance)
Less chance (less chance)
Less chance for feeling irate (ooh)
Less chance (ooh)
Less chance (ooh)
Less chance for feeling irate
Soft reggae music playing
Lovers vibes they must sayin'
Find your girl for last dance
The night is nearly over
Her head lay on your shoulder
As she huggles you hold her real tight
