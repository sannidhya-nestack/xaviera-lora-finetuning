It don't mean a lot to me
Who's wrong or who's right
All these politicians in a perpetual food fight
You've got to rise
You've got to rise up
Rise up from the ashes to a new horizon
You've got to rise
You've got to rise up
Rise up from the ashes to a new horizon
Our enemies won't surrender, not so easy anymore
Now we've lost a completely different kind of war
You got to rise, you got to rise up
Rise up from the ashes to a new horizon
Addicted and rejected, sleeping on the street
Who'd have thought we would be so easy to defeat
You got to rise
You got to rise up
Rise up from the ashes to a new horizon
You got to rise
You got to rise up
Rise up from the ashes to a new horizon
