Greetings from the Most High
This is the ragged, ragged rock, yeah, yeah
There's no use that you try and run
When this hits you, you'll feel no pain
These are the messages I bring to you
Let me arrest, don't let them fall in vain
Unclear your mind see just sign feel how it flow a bit
Just unlock all those spiritual chains
Relax now open your eyes and let your soul exist
Musically it hits you straight through the brain
Cause you know
You know that there is nothing for you to lose
Uplifting meditating musically with your royal fruits I say
Ragged, ragged, rockers, roots
Mystical music straight from your burning bush
Ragged, ragged rockers
So steady, steady
No worries with Jah music and we will burn his kush
Cause you know
You know that there is nothing for you to lose
Uplifting, meditating, music we with Jah royal fruits I say
Reggae, Reggae
Rattata pop
From the Bahamas straight to Ethiopia now tracks
Reggae, Reggae rockers
So steady say
No worries with your music and we will burn some kush
There's no use that you try and run
When this hits you, you'll feel no pain
These are your messages I bring to you
Let me arrest, don't let them fall in vain
And clear your mind, see just sign, fill out with lower bid
Just unlock all those spiritual chains
Relax now, open your eyes and let your soul exist
Musically leads you straight through the brain
you know, you know that there is nothing for you to lose
Uplifting, meditating, musically we shall royal fruits I say
Roots like it rain
Bratatata
And we will burn some good
I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone
