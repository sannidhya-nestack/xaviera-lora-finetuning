A passage across the ocean
Soul lost at sea
I never would have journeyed if I knew that it changed me
But you can't escape the beauty, woah, it still bewilders me
So you go on looking for something to set you free
I'll go home alone
I just can't seem to fight it
I'll go home
Back to the rhythm that burns in me
A passage to adventure
Still can't find my way
The sky is oh so cloudy
Can't find that sunny day
So I go on looking
Hoping oh there's a way
My heart is where my home is
And so I got to say
Home, home
I just can't seem to fight it
I'll go home, home, home
Back to the rhythm that burns in me
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding
Boy
Gay
Waiting for tomorrow
It's just another day
Wipe away my sorrow
There's only one way
I'll go home alone
I just can't, just can't, just can't seem to fight it, yeah yeah
I'll go on, back to the rhythm that burns in me
Whoa whoa yeah
I'll go on
I just can't, just can't, just can't seem to fight it, yeah
I'll go home, yeah
Back to the rhythm that burns in me
Whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa
Ooh, ooh, ooh
