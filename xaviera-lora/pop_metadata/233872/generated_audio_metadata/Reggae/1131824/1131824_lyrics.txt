I always thought I understood what love was
I always thought I had it under control
But you, you let me on a merry dance
You messed around and wrecked a very happy romance
Never let it show what you were up to
I never guessed you'd take me for a fool
But I woke up to what was going on
Never thought I'd see you acting so uncool
Under the pretense of love
Under the pretense of love
You stole my heart
Well you tore it apart
Your heart, heart, heart
Really thought I found myself the right boy
I really thought we'd make it last forever
It took a while to put it all together
And all the time you were being really clever
Under the pretense of love
Under the pretense of love
You stole my heart
You just tore it apart
With your hard, hard, hard
Face up to the fact
You played a game behind my back
Your double life was out of sight
You were all sweetness at night
Under the pretense of love
Under the pretense of love
You broke my heart
You just tore it apart
Heart, heart, heart, you're still heartless
Why'd you have to be so hard? (I'm in a free chance of love)
You stole my heart (I'm in a free chance of love)
You just tore it apart (I'm in a free chance of love)
Oh, baby (I'm in a free chance of love)
Why'd you have to be so hard?
