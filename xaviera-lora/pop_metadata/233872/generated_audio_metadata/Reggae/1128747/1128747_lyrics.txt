Every aspect of the world I made
Every promise with each brick I lay
Seems so fragile like a paper wall
When I hear temptation call
In the heart of a whisper everything changes
In the heat of the moment life rearranges
I try to fight it but I know I can't
I've otten what I am
In the heart of a whisper
And I know I'm going down
And I know I'm going down
And the darkness feels so damn exciting
No use fighting
I tried so hard to keep my spirit true
To build a front that darkness couldn't leap through
I lacked the strength I watched the levee break
And now I'm drowning in the lake
In the heart of a whisper everything changes
In the heat of the moment life rearranges
I try to find it but I know I can't
I've otten who I am
In the heart of a whisper
And I know I'm going down
And I know I'm going down
Going down
In the heart of a whisper
In the heart of a whisper, everything changes
In the heart of a whisper, nothing arranges
In the heart of a whisper, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
In the heart of a whisper, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
In the heart of a whisper, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Voices calling the sound, sound, sound
Choices pulling me down, down, down
I am drowning in the horror of a whisper
