Did you ever have a wish for a girl who'd inspire a 10 ,000-year-ish?
A color hot desire, well, let me introduce you please to a girl with the bill
I think she took the little red pill
She's a sight to see, less money, a smile worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She struts in her high-heeled shoes, life's gotten better, she's got everything to lose
Fashion's so fly, you have to get an airplane seat, at what cost?
Lost a pretty penny, come and get some, would you like a little treat?
Turning heads everywhere, trust me, there are very, very many
She's a little more than filthy rich
One tough bitch
Welcome to the sweetness
Did you ever have a wish
For a girl who could inspire
A ten thousand year wish
A hella hot desire
Hella let me introduce you please
To a girl who fits the bill
I think she took the little red pill
She's a sight to see
This money
A smile worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She struts in her high heel shoes
Life's gotten better
Shit got everything to lose
Fashion's so polite
You have to get an airplane
See at what cost
Lost a pretty penny
Come and get some
Would you like a little treat?
Turning heads every little treat
Turning heads everywhere
Trust me there are very very many
She's a little more than filthy rich
One tough bitch
Welcome to the sweetness
Oh Miss Money, you are sexy sweet honey
Is it fame that you adore, miss money?
Now you got a little, would you like a little more, miss money?
Sweet little honey, I can see that you are vexed
Take a minute, check your mobile, tell me if you got my text
Flexible, finessin', I can see that you've been messin' with some things
I think you think that you've never seen before
She's got a wallet, but it's quite the little fatty
Generous, she is very, very, very catty
Buying up the love is something that she can't ever seem to get enough of
Type of a card, like to play the part
Crushin' it very hard, in the market for a heart
Oh, Miss Money, you're a fantasy
I think about you every day
I wonder if you'll ever be
A significant other, person to a person in your life
Maybe you're a girlfriend, maybe you're a wife
Miss Money, oh she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of green in her eyes
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
She's got a stockpile of sweet admirers
They're all just the assets that are fueling her desire
She trades her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment not selling just to park it
Her laughter rings like a cash register chime
But love's a currency she can't seem to mind a portfolio of hearts or what a portfolio
But the dividends of love she'll never really know
Oh miss money, oh she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of green in her eyes
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
A market of romance she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh how she'll spend to see
She's a penny pincher with a golden touch
But the cost of love, it seems too much
Miss Money, oh, the irony's not lost
Can't budget for love, it's an endless cost
Now she's back up in the market of hearts
A fiscal failure torn apart
But oh Miss Money, you're still a sight
