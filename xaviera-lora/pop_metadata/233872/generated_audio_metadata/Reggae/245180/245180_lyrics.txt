When I was a child I seen too many things
When I got old reality killed my dreams
Overstand the game we play
Understand the price we pay
The poor are getting poor
And the rich have seemed to gone away
With drugs come poverty and neglect
And in my hood, ain't nobody there to serve and protect'til this war
Have you ever walked over the blood of your brother?
And those who you pay to serve and protect, they beat you down
And the system takes everything you have
When you fall, there's nobody else around
I'm calling on the spirit, but I don't think you hear it
Physical death is the price that some must pay
To free their children from a permanent psychological death
Then nothing shall be more redemptive, we shall overcome
Before the victory's won, some will be misunderstood and called bad names
And dismissed as rabble-rousers and agitators
But we shall overcome, and I'll tell you why
When I was a child I seen too many things
When I got old, reality killed my dreams
Overstand the game we play
Understand the price we pay
The poor are getting poorer
And the rich have seemed to gone away
With drugs come poverty and neglect
And in my hood, ain't nobody there to serve and protect'til this war
Have you ever walked over the blood of your brother?
And those who you pay to serve and protect, they beat you down
And the system takes everything you have
When you fall there's nobody else around
I'm calling all the spirit but I don't think you hear it
When the night comes everyone
Feels like the chosen ones abandoned in the land of Babylon
God is singing the same old song
Prison slave in the street
And we don't even know only drugs are there in factories
Quantity in debt in the hands of our babies
His genocide, his new hands making the roof
Killing man is so sweet
We're our weapons of war
Feels like the chosen ones abandoned in the land of Babylon
Got us singing the same old song
Prison, slave industry and we don't even own no drug or gun factories
How do they end up in the hands of our babies?
It's genocide, it's new age slavery
Killing my ancestry, won't you let us be?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Home
