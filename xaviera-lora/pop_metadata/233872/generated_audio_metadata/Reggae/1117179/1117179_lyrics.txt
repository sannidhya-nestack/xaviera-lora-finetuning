You know, all some people do is yap-yapping, but it ain't solving nothing
I say you keep on beating up your guns
But in return that's not solving the problem
The only thing that keeps on moving is your tongue
But we need change to respond with action
I've seen the record break in terms of the crime rate
Lord for goodness sake, for goodness sake
And as far as the eyes can see
There is no penalty for criminality on our streets
I say you keep on beating up your guns
But in return, that's not solving the problem
The only thing that keeps on moving is your tongue
But we need change to respond with action
All I see is murder murder the crime rate so ridiculous
Broad daylight killings ain't no witnesses
Kids in the crossfire heaven to the crossroads
Say you a lost boy you just a lost soul
Never never land never ending story never ever have I seen so many bodies being buried
Leaders we need a hand and not a hand out
Y'all need to man up all I hear is man down
King with no crown beat with no sound
These red nose bozos know they all clowns surround sound
Downtown, even underground
Moving in the crowd, pow, semi-automatic rounds
Martial arts, the rhythm, I'm just giving you wisdom
You don't need a religion, I just need you to listen
I'm just giving you vision
Gotta change how you living, take it back to beginning
I say you keep on beating up your guns
But in return, that's not solving the problem
The only thing that keeps on moving is your tongue
But we need change to respond with action
Mr. Marsha rhythm 242 is a given
The love for the Caribbean, no wishful thinking
So global in distinction, technicolor in vision
Got a piece of paradise while we living in prison
It takes a village to raise what happened to the days
Less talk more action, no serenade
Gunshots ablaze, bum stocks erased
Ricocheted worldwide, ghetto is to fade
Clipping all shades, heads left in the grave
Many dreams cut short death, razor blade
Our actions are written, our speech gets permission
They go hand in hand, so take a good and listen
Crime is everybody's business, it touches us all
From the streets to parliament, we can't ignore the call
Because it's so deep, so many catching sleep
Involuntary, eternally from six feet
I say you keep on beating up your guns
But in return that's not solving the problem
The only thing that keeps on moving is your tongue
But we need change
To respond with action
