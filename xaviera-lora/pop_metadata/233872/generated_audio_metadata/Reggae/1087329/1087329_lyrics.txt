So you see the earth have everything for me, this is what I'm saying, and yes there's some guys who beat up and go and kill the youths that they need

You know that I don't know why some die, always
Spirit of the Seas
But we are still here to go
At the pause, remember that
Check this, yes, the earth it prepare everything we need
And yes, still somebody are dying fi hungry
So many food are into this world
And yes, still my little baby is starving

You miss and greedy, everyday you get up, grabbing the needy
And when you get it, you still don't want it
You are believable but poor people they hungry
