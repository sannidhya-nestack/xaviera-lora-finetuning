Saturday I thought about it, Sunday I wrote it down
Monday morning came and still I had it on my head
Tuesday was a bluesy day, I put it in an envelope
Wednesday I put a stamp upon it and sent it in the mail
Could you be here? Could you be? Could you be?
Thursday morning I awoke, cheery as a bell
Noontime came, telephone rang, it was you on the other end
You asked me if on Friday I could meet you at your best
I said yes, of course I can
Did you get my letter yet?
Could you be, could you be, could you be
Love, could you be here? Could you be long? Could you be long?
Once in a lifetime, two times in the sunshine, three times, oh my
So we found ourselves a preacher and had ourselves a ball
We travelled round the world and made it to every casting call
But then the alarm rang again, it was Saturday
What a dream it was, I had only one week that passed
Could you be here? Could you be? Could you be?
Love, could you be, could you be the one, could you be
Love, once in a lifetime, two times in the springtime, three times all mine
