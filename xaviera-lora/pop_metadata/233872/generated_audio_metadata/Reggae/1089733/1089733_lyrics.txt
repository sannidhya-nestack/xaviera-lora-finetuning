Who I have, yeah man, yeah man
A you mi a talk to, the pleasure
Me have a self-duty a gone too bad from the other day
A mi say who can't hear must meet dem water low watts (remember that)
Uh huh, ay, you see it?
So me tell dem dem mustn't cheat
Pop stick inna dem ears and even mi pick out dem teeth
You see it?
So me tell dem dem mustn't cheat
Dem come stir up the fire now dem can't stand the heat
Mi climbing up the chart
Watch this like black people climbing up the ladder
You
I tell this generation stop fight one another
I tell them to love up them sisters and brothers
And behind me back is like David and Goliath
I step out in the street and then I sight pure riot
I shout out you people keep quiet
You must listen to the job and the BS and the ayat
Not even you government can keep you quiet
Stop run from yourself stop fight against yourself
Only the almighty God can give you a help
So run by some wicked and evil lost people
Just like the road it surround with vehicle
Keep your mind pure and don't study evil
Make the holy spirit use you like a vehicle
You see it?
So me tell them dem Muslim children
Pop stick it in dem ears and even me pick out dem teeth
You see it?
So me tell them they mustn't cheat
Them come stir up the fire now them can't stand the heat
Tell them time for you rise from your sleep
Tell them this is not no time for you dream
So many life you make God down the drain
Oh no tell me people that wish to be blamed oh no see it
So many parents is shame, oh no tell me
People a who a feel the pain
Sweet sweet Jamaica eat a cup in a flames
A the garrison community always a blame
Seems like the bigger heads them a play game
Bigger heads let the pain and garrison take the chain
If the true life even then why no be the same
Them a blame dem government just to make things better
Before it get better it get worse, you see it?
So me tell dem dem ussen cheat
Pop stick inna dem ears and even me pick out dem teeth
You see it?
So me tell dem dem ussen cheat
Dem come stir up the fire now dem can't stand the heat
You see it?
So me tell dem dem ussen cheat
Pop stick inna dem ears and even me pick out dem teeth
You see it?
So me tell dem dem ussen cheat
Dem come stir up the fire now dem can't stand the heat
Mi granny used to say mi nah go live fi see dem days ya but now mi live fi see it make me amaze
Over dem ya situation ya make me catch fright
Sometime mi even feel fi walk out a parade
A war and crime full up the youth dem ways
Mi see war and rumors of war
Mi see nation rise up against nation
And I see kingdom rise up against kingdom
But mi say look up cause your redemption draw nigh with so wrong
By vampires and spies and no liquefy the hypocrite
Them did fight, and all the kill back by the hypocrite back knife
You see it? So me tell them they musn't cheat
Pop stick inna dem ears and even pick out dem teeth
You see it? So me tell them they musnt cheat
Dem come stir up the fire now dem can't stand the heat
