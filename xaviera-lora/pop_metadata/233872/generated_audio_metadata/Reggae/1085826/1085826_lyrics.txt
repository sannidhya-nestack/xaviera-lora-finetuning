But I know it's more easier said than done and all
But the truth of the matter is you will die right here
If you don't move on, seein'
Move on, move on, move on, it's time to move on
Move on, move on, move on, it time to move on
There's no game, move on
Why remain, move on?
There's too much pain, move on
Man, why complain, just move on
Move on, move on, move on
It's time to move on
Move on, move on, move on, it's time to move on
Yeah when me say, man step by step move forward
And no matter how they call you a coward
You and you alone know what you are going through
So you and you alone
Jah know you know what you have to do
Mami no say you don't feel strong enough
Una do have the strength and you won't give up
The truth of the matter you done had enough
But you have to pick up yourself, pick up yourself and get up, get up!
Move on, move on, move on, it's time to move on
Move on, move on, move on, it's time to move on
Time fi live and a time fi die
Time fi laugh and a time fi cry
Time fi frown and a time fi smile
Man time to dry your eyes
Time fi go and a time fi stay
Time fi pause and a time fi delay
Time to move on do you hear what I say?
Boy you will die right here if you stay
Move on, move on, move on, it's time to move on
Move on, move on, move on, it's time to move on
I declare, you won't die here, yes I declare
You can't die here, you won't die here, you won't die here
If you believe that you won't die then put your hands in the air and declare
You won't die here
You can't die here (You can't die here)
