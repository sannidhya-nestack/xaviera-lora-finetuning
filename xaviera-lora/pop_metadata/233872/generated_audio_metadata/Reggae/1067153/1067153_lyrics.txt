I don't wanna lose you now
Can't imagine living on my own
Lately things at home have not been right
Our house is a battlefield where we have silent fights
It's obvious you've been avoiding me, yeah
And the more you do it fills up my cup with anxiety
Before feelings even turn to hate
I just wanna set the record straight
Blame me for being late on our anniversary date
For the times you dress so fine but I ot to say
Well I'm ashamed, I am to blame for telling some untruths
Blame me if you want but I won't give up on me and you
Blame me if you want
At first I thought it's just a passing phase
Then minutes grow like hours
And hours became days
It used to be when you walked in a room
The sunshine walked in with you
But now it's caught as doom
I would gladly go down on my knees
Just to beg you to ive me please
Blame me for being late on our anniversary date
For the times you dress so fine
But I ot to say
While I'm ashamed
I am to blame
For telling some untruths
Blame me if you want
But I won't give up on me and you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Can't let this good thing go to waste
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Now while we still have what it takes
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
To make it work
Why would it hurt
Blame it for being late
On our anniversary day
For the times you dress so fine
But I ot to say
Well I'm ashamed, I am to blame, until there's some truth
Blame me if you want but I won't give up on me and you
So blame me if you want but still believe in me and you
