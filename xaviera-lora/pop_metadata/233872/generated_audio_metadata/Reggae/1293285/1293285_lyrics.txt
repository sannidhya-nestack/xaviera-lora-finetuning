Smoke rising over stadiums pain
And no great wonder walks again
People cry, but still they're holding on
To a sweet moment before it's gone
People in the city cry
There'll be another way, no matter where
Words and changes, no
We've got a smile today (alright)
Chasing the secret secret within the night
I'm tired of rides that just don't feel right
Diving deep without a safety net
Into a world where stone cold whispers breathe
People in the city crying
Can't be another way
Births and ages long
But God smiles all day
Breathing the smoke of troubled times
An old man smiles, leaves pain behind
Storing moments that bring a tear
Blanket through all its fear
Leave let the city cry, oh yeah
Got to be a lot of way, no way
Burden changes love, they say
Last mile today
All right, smile, smile, smile
