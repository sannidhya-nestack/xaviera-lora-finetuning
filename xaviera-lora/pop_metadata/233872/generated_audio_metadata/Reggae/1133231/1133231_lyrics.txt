Let me take my life feel like a PA
Come and take my life feel like a CA
Why you wanna live real like a DA
We free nigga yeah we can pretend
Take my hands I can escape
Now it's my time I can explain
Take my hands I can escape
Now it's my period I can spend
Come and take my hands make me free again
Come and take my hands, make me free again
Come and take my hands, I can't escape
Come and take my hands, I can't escape

Never touch my hands, yeah I am easy
Never touch my hands, yeah, I'm easy
Mannequins in my room, I can't touch it
Put it on in my bed, I can't fuck it, I can't fuck it

Now it's my P-Rod that can expand
