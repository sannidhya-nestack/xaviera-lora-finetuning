He said to her give it one more try
Make her believe he's a nice guy
Touch deep inside and say goodbye
Tough time lovers by the emotions
You can't hear love in their conversation
Too bad they're going the wrong direction
Woah woah woah
No one knows how much they will love
Woah woah
They get crazy, ooh ooh
Fly fly like a dog
No one knows how much they will love
No no
They get crazy today
Fly fly like a dog
Next day I saw them in the park
Late at night kissing in the dark
I've been watching them they get so shat
Tough time lovers will come on your way
Never never listen what you say
They'll do anything to shake your day
Woah woah woah
No one knows how much that we love
Yeah yeah
They get crazy today
Fly fly like a dove
No one knows how much that we love
No no
They get crazy today
Fly fly like a dove
They fly up in the sky
They flying up in the sky
They fly up in the sky
They get crazy
Fly fly like a bird
