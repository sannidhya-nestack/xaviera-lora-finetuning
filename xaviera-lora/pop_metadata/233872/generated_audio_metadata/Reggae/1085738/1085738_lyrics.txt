I a do it a rhyme
Me tell you seh the star a fi shine
Always with a distant punchline
Me no want nothing inna Babylon to hold me ya think
No want nothing weh dem a eat, nah nothing weh dem drink
Nah nothing from Beagan to hold me ya think
Look ya now Babylon a sink inna sea
Nothing inna Babylon to hold me ya think
No want nothing weh dem a eat, nah nothing weh dem drink
Nah nut no from pagan to how me a ting, aye
Babylon a sink what you know
Mi no want dem wheat fi bun because mi know dem a bun pork
Mi no want dem food fi them because mi know dem a name pork
Mi nah run no throat, dem wah in me with a rope
Dem wah lock it up jah jah ko one jah coat
Cos two badu dem wah carry me in a coat
Big Jota rem a sail off in a boat
Nah make no exhaust, a man nah go vote, nah
Dem wah cut me throat
Me no want nothing inna Babylon to hold me, I think
No want nothing weh dem a eat, nah nothing weh dem drink
Nah nothing from pagan to hold me, I think
Look here now, Babylon a sink inna sea
Nothing inna Babylon to hold me, I think
No want nothing weh dem a eat, nah nothing weh dem drink
Nah want nothing from pagan to how me a think
Aye Babylon a sing
Me nah want nothing from Babylon feet
Want swell me belly inna dem juicy sweet
True dem know me always a head up na the east
Say dem want kill me off true dem think me a sleep but
Born corruption inna cribbles and crease
Born dem up na minces dem choppy inna peace
Dragon and the deer you ta say dem a the beast
What you know when Rasta man a turn on the heat
Me nah want nothing inna Babylon to how me a think
Nah wah nothing weh dem a eat
Nah nothing weh dem drink
Nah nothing from pagan to homie ya think
Look ya now
Babylon a sink inna sea
Nothing inna Babylon to homie ya think
Nah wah nothing weh dem a eat
Nah nothing weh dem drink
Nah nothing from pagan to homie ya think
Aye
Babylon a sink what ya know
Nothing from Babylon at all
Bundung Peter and me no lift the pall
Want touch ya wrong inna basket ball dem a stall
When the Rasta man a make a phone call
No nothing from them, cause dem a eat them, dem a corrupt your children and cause it problem
The Rasta man a take the fire and a burn them, me a burn dem inna 9 or inna 10
Me no want nothing inna Babylon to wow me I think
No want nothing where dem a eat, no nothing where dem drink
Nah nothing no from pagan to how me a think
Look here now

Nothing inna Babylon to how me a think
Nah wah nothing no where dem a eat

Me no want dem rice fi bun because me know dem a bun coke
Me no want dem food fi nyam because me know dem a nyam poke

Dem wah lakila chacha kow and jagote
Kostu badu, dem wah carry me inna coat
Big jute a rhyme a say laugh inna a boat
Nah make no exhaust, a man nah go vote, aye

Nah want nothing where dem a eat, nah nothing where dem drink
Nah nut no from pagan to how me a think
