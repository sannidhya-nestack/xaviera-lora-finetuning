Ah, yeah, spliff no fishy, ah
Hold a meds to your head, roll over and soak in a bed
Roll a spliff tight like the dread, puff, inhale with your chest
Finish it best man your lip, roll it nice so you no split
Yes that a so you finish it
Roll in front of a load is a process
Don't you dare pass me no nonsense
To build a spliff is a art
Always have to work smart
Crush cannibals
Just talk up
Tech for a puff
Get focus
Point a locust
Time if you discuss
Leroy and shownuff
Up in the drawer for the weed
Like the scissors rough on toe you in need
Grind it up right till it keef
Aromatic scent give relief
When you grab a hand cut for the length
Exotic herbs give me strength
Frass have me strong like Samson
Some days head kinda Charlie Manson
Smoke so much you're getting shaky
Don't pass the ugly burning spliff to me
You can't handle any more refreshing healing got you singing I want to go super saiyan
Doped up don't interrupt raw uncut innervist me trust make sure it pure kush accept the challenge so you don't rush
Hold a med, screw your head
Roll over and soak in a bed
Roll a spliff, tight like the dread (weak and buff)
Inhale with your chest
Ah, let your mind do the rest
High grade, that a blue crest (you already boy a)
Girl scout, cookies is the best
Wild child, Jack Herra is next
Smoke so much you're getting shaky
Don't pass the ugly burners spliff to me
You can't handle anymore read French and healing got you singing
I went to the super saying woke up
Crushed cannibals
Just poke up
Tech for a puff
Get focus
Put in a low cost
Topic we discuss
Leroy and show nuts
Don't stunt with the runs, a ground crush give a little push
A solid ting on a flat bush, feel lunch is purple punch
It's a hand deck that's a hunch, alright, fast path again, whoo
Wish me luck, last time, mm-mm, ready ready?
Okay, ready ready?
Smoke so much you're getting shaky
Don't pass the ugly burners cliff to me
You can't handle anymore refreshing healing
Got you singing I went took a super saying
Doped up don't interrupt
Raw uncut in herpes meat trust
Make sure it's pure kush
Accept the challenge so you don't rush
Hold a meds, close your head
Roll over and smoke inna bed
Roll a spliff, tight like in dread
Puff, inhale it with your chest
Dry feeling? Or is it tummy?
