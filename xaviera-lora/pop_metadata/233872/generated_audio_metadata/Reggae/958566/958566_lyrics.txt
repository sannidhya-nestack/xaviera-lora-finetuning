Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, sing
Because today, because today
We gotta put the guns away
No more pain (no more pain)
And no more sorrow (no more sorrow)
Because today, because today
We gotta put those bombs away
For our children (no more pain)
And their tomorrow
Think about this world that we're living in
And the bad news every day
So much dying and so much crying
Unnecessarily
Don't you think it's time that we stop this crime
And bring back the smiling face
Peace and love and harmony
Throughout this world in every place
Because today, because today
We gotta put the guns away
No more pain
And no more sorrow
Because today
Because today
We gotta put those bombs away
For our children
And their tomorrow
Put the guns away
We got to live and let live
Don't take without giving
Begin from within
We living, we living
Rainy days will come oh yeah
But sun will shine on through
Bring the hope, peace and love
Chorus for me and you
Freedom from within (freedom, freedom)
We can't do without, yeah
Hand in hand we'll win (hand in hand)
What's it all about? Yeah
Anagalayo sometimes it why be stressing
Just trying to find a place between my burden and my blessing
Sometimes I question if life is just a test then
Who am I to mess with what is fate and what is destined
Everything is everything it's life it's all connected
But bread drain we need to fight and challenge it's aggression
Love your enemy ive them then et it
Sing the tune, love the music, live the message, don't let the internet
Come intercept your intellect, it's all a bliss effect
And regret is insignificant
Life is limitless and love itself is infinite
Let's disconnect from ignorance and let your wings and womb connect and fly
Freedom from within, ooh yeah
We can't do without
Hand in hand will we
What's it all about
Because today
Because today
We gotta put the guns away
No more pain (no more pain)
And no more sorrow (no more sorrow)
Because today
Because today
We gotta put those bombs away
For our children (no more pain)
And their tomorrow
Ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
