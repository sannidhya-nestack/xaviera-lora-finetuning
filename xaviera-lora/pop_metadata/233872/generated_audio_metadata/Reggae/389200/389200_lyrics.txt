Saturday I thought about it
Sunday I wrote it down
Monday morning came
And still I had it on my head
Tuesday was a bluesy day
I put it in an envelope
Wednesday I put a stamp upon it and sent it in the mail
Could you be here? Could you be? Could you be?
Thursday morning I awoke cheery as a bell
Noontime came, telephone rang, it was you on the other end
You asked me if on Friday I could meet you at your best
I said yes, of course I can, did you get my letter yet?
Could you be, could you be, could you be
Love, could you be in? Could you be warm? Could you be?
Love, once in a lifetime
Two times in the sunshine
Three times, oh my
So we found ourselves a preacher and had ourselves a ball
We travelled round the world and made it to every question call
But then the alarm rang again
It was a sadder day
What a dream it was
I had only one we could pass
Could you be here?
Could you be?
Could you be?
Love, could you be, could you be the one, could you be a love, once in a lifetime, two times in the springtime, three times all mine
