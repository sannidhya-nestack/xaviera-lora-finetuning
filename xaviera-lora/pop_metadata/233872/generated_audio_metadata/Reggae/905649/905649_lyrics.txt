Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
With the girls at the club on 8th street
New band was about to play
I could tell that the crowd was hungry
For the guys to take their place
Wasn't really expecting nothing
Then I heard the first groove come in
All of a sudden I was flying
And I fell in love again
It's like they called out my name, oh
I can't explain the way
I fell in love with a song so deep in love
I fell in love with a song
So deep in love, oh
The second burst was a revelation
I could feel my heart open up
Every word made a real connection
Healing me one by one
The crowd disappeared around me
So lost in the melody
And as my heart was racing
I slipped into a dream
I couldn't shake the tingles
Moving up and down my spine
I can't believe that I
I fell in love with a song
So deep in love
I fell in love with a song so deep in love, oh
I know it sounds crazy
But I've never felt this way
As the song neared the end
I could sense my last breath
It took over me
It was shouting my name
And I won't be the same
Oh, oh
I fell in love with a song so deep in love
I fell in love with a song so deep in love
