Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Say that but I'm on a gun town, say put your guns down
No more fighting ya brothers this is the sound of peace
Oh God set your children free (say what you say)
Say that but I'm on a gun town, say put your guns down
No more fighting ya brothers this is the sound of peace
Oh God set your children free
See the Bahamas ain't no gun town
With people getting gunned down
Streets ain't safe for the kids to have fun now
We need more love now
Gotta live as one now
No rock nation but peace runs this town
This is from my island
We gotta stop the violence
Don't wanna see no more blood run through my lens
No more police sirens
No more mothers crying
We could live as one if we just realized this
See the Bahamas ain't no gun town
So put your guns down
No more fighting ya brothers this is the sound of peace
Oh God set your children free (say what you say)
Say the Bahama not a gun town (yeah) so put your guns down (yeah)
No more fighting ya brothers this is the sound of peace
Oh God set your children free (you say when they go in the streets)
Seeing these streets is getting hotter, hotter
Every man wanna say that he is shatter, shatter
Till somebody went up on him and him shatter, shatter
And now them lock up, lock up
Increase the peace, say it's on them need for bark up, bark up
So if you feel like a bad man keep it to yourself
You reap what you sow so you're better
So something good for your health
Stop hating on your brothers for their money and their wealth
You haven't learned to live in peace
Say lover I'm on a gun town
So put your guns down
No more fighting your brothers this is the sound of peace
Oh God set your children free
Say what you say?
Say nah nah nah nah, take gun down
So put your guns down

Stop the hatred
More love is what we need to be embracing
Life is what you make it
So stop the hating
Because love can conquer all
If we just embrace it
More love is what we need to be embracing Life is what you're making, so stop the hating
Because love can conquer all And now I'm a knock on town, so put your guns down
