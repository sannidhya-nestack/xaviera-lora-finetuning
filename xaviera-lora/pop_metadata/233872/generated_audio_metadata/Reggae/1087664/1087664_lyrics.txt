Don't you know that you are my moonlight in my night girl, how you will adjust me darling? (My number one)
And don't you know that you are my sunshine in my day, how will you adjust me girl? (My number one) What? (My number one) Yeah! (My number one) Woo! (My number one) Show! (My number one)
I quote him this girl from we going to college
It seems like she believe me not have enough knowledge
She love the guy with the black Ferrari she fell in love
With a soldier in the army, me friend dem a say me mustn't worry too much
I soon get a girl of my own
I don't believe my friend dem is sure
I want a girl with a lot of knowledge
And inna her brain she fi have dignity
She fi full up of vibes and inspiration
We can work hand in hand and help each other
I will treat her like how me treat me mother
And if it is possible me treat her better
Me come in from work and open my door
And me carpet alone me sit pon the floor
And inna my room I just me pillow pon my bedda
You're like moonlight (wow)
Brighten up the night daily (yeah)
Make this feel so right baby (so where you going darling?)
You spend your life with me (and you know that you are what?)
I'm the perfect summer woman (yeah)
I buy her some chocolate and some ice cream
To my surprise she were not around
I buy her a pet and a bunch of roses
To my surprise she could not be found
It seems like she can just sell look some dollars
Either she can just to be a gold digger
To my knowledge I just a friend and she a follower
But now she reveal her true colour
I was thinking about her better
To have a better life and a brighter future
What a was together would have make things better
But now she gone with another fella
I wish she could come back and a me little umbrella
And don't take no news from no news carrier
It only bring hate and build up barrier
My love for you it full of power
What? (Writing up the night daily)
Two and two (Made this feel so right, baby)
I'm here to tell you all the things (Woo!)
(Now you can spend your life free)
Definitely, girl! (Come on)
(My number one)
What? (My number one hoe)
Yeah, show, what? (My number one hoe)
If I was a boy I would treat you like a girl (girl)
If I was a man I would treat you like a woman (woman)
If I was a prince I would treat you like a princess because you are (my number one)
If I was a emperor I treat you like an empress
But I am a king I have to treat you like a queen
Nothing in this world cannot come between us
If I am a dreamer I'm not alone
Like I'm writing up the night daily (That's the girl, that's the girl)
And it just feels so right, baby (Tutu, baby)
Who could stand you like me? (What?)
My number one (Yeah)
My number one (What?)
Oh, my number one (Show, uh-huh)

You are also my champion, you know

Just let me hold you
Be together, forever

Say you're my moonlight in the darkest night
And don't you know you're my sunlight in the day
