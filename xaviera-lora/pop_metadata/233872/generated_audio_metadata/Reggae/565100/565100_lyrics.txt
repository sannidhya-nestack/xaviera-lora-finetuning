Have you ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever loved someone?
Have you ever, ever, ever loved someone who makes you cry?
Have you ever loved someone, someone who makes you cry?
Have you ever loved someone, someone who makes you smile?
Have you ever loved someone, someone who makes you die?
Have you ever loved someone, someone who makes you smile?
Sometimes you cry, sometimes you smile, sometimes you joke
In a relationship we have so many consequences to face
The more you laugh, the more you smile, the more you cry
But when you love someone
Take it easy baby
You have to understand
There is to cry
There is to smile
Sometimes we cry
Have you ever loved someone?
Have you ever loved someone, someone who makes you smile?
Have you ever loved someone, someone who makes you cry?
Have you ever loved someone, someone who makes you smile?
Uke tando mutu genki soyako yonke
Nyankolana loma selilo
Niti kulungile, e gazilako, li haman e gazilake
Noma inga itelanyo, e kizeti munigehe
Ukutanda si ku ijoela
When you love someone, be there for someone
When you got someone, just keep someone close to you
When you love someone, don't care what them say
When you love someone, don't you ever look backwards
When you love someone, be there for someone you love
Have you ever loved someone, someone who makes you cry?
Have you ever loved someone, someone who makes you smile?
Have you ever loved someone, someone who makes you die?
Have you ever loved someone, someone who makes you smile?
