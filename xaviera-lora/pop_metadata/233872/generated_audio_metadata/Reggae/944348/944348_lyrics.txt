If you a ninja why you sin
Why you never ever trust me around your friends
Why you drink your liquor straight with no chaser
Or your waistline mash up the place ya
Why you take it and you talk
Or you bubble up and make your body rock
You not ask me when you winding slow
How you never miss a carnival
How you catch up in a parking lot
Take time where you going
Party night strings flowing
Even when the song cut off, cut off, cut off, cut off, cut off, cut off
My girl don't leave me, my girl don't leave me
Even when the lights come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
My girl don't leave me, my girl don’t leave me
Me have a question for your waistline darling
Can you fling it up, fling it up, fling it up
Me have a question for your waistline baby
Can you pack it up, pack it up, pack it up
Me have a question for your waistline sweetie
Can you wind it up, wind it up, wind it up
Me have a question for your waistline sexy
Show them all your waistline sexy
Wind it up
Why you come here with your man
It don't matter cause I really give up
Why you let me feel on your body
When you know the people dem watching
Why you fed up in the paint
Why your body sweeter than a sugar cane
Flexible when you bend down low
So much feelings when I whine with you
Every single time I whine with you
Can I spend a little time with you?
Can I spend a little time with you?
Me have a question for your waistline darling
Can you fling it up, fling it up, fling it up?
Me have a question for your waistline baby
Can you back it up, back it up, back it up?
Me have a question for your waistline sweetie
Can you wind it up, wind it up, wind it up
Me have a question for your waistline sexy
Show them all your waistline sexy
If you an angel why you sing
Why you never ever trust me around your friends
Why you drink your liquor straight with no chaser
Or your waistline mash up the place ya
Why you tickers and you talk
How you bubble up and make your body rock
Hypnotize me when you winding slow
How you never miss a carnival
How you catch up in a bar, can I
Take time where you going
Party night strings blowing
Even when the song cut off cut off cut off cut off cut off cut off
My girl don't leave me
My girl don't leave me
Even when the lights come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
My girl don't leave me
My girl don't leave me
How you never miss a carnival
How you catch up in a bar, you know
Take time where you going
Party night, strings flowing
How you never miss a carnival
How you catch up in a bar, you know
Take time where you going
Party night, strings flowing
