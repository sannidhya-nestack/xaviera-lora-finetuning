Everybody needs a ho-go and it go it go ho-go
So get here on the double'cause you know it will be good
And don't be feeling down when there's no one around
Turn that frown upside down as we pick up the pace
We're dancing in the club
Looking for some huggy love
Listening to the rubber duck
We'll be dancing all night
Huggo, huggo, huggo, huggo, huggo
Huggo, huggo, huggo, hugho
A huggle in the morning, the evening too
Huggle, huggle, huggle, that's all you got to do
Everybody needs a huggle or two
Huggle, huggle, huggle, that all you got to do
Say, huggle (huggle, huggle)
Huggle, huggle, huggle (huggle, huggle)
Huggle (huggle, huggle)
A huggle or two
You huggle your sister, you huggle your brother
You huggle your father, you huggle your mother
You huggle your grandpa, your grandma too
Everybody huggle, a huggle, huggle, huggle, say
Huggle (huggle, huggle) a huggle, huggle, huggle (huggle, huggle)
Huggle (huggle, huggle) a huggle or two
Everybody needs a huggle
Eiko eiko huggle
So get here on the double
you know it will be good
Now don't be feeling down
When there's no one around
Turn that frown upside down
As we pick up the pace
Be dancing in the club
Looking for some huggy love
Listening to the rubber dum
We'll be dancing all night
Hog on, hog on, hog on, hog on, hog on
Hog on, hog on, hog on, hog onto
Hog on, hog on, hog on, hog on, hog on
Hog on, hog on, hog on, hog onto
Huggle, huggle, huggle, huggle, huggle, huggle, huggle,
Huggle, huggle, huggle all day
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
