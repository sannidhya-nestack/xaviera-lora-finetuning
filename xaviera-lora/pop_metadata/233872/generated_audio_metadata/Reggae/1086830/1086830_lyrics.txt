Ooh them guys
It's the herbalist and specialised
You got to roll up your eyes and recognise
Ooh them boys
Yes it's the FTP
Proud to be a part of the crystal family
Ooh them guys
It's the specialised and herbalist
With the melody that you just can't resist
Ooh them boys
Meet all of the FTPs
Seminated here with uncanny rap ability
From troubled thoughts
To subtle talks comes problems of a bigger sort
Get caught short you ain't got no retort
The last report I heard was you were struggling for words
And it was just things that sent together from these sensors down to birds
We had to be a wise guy shrouded in your white lies
No surprise you get about as much respect as hate crimes
Big in the game I think not, you're down in the name of it all
You better be ready to stop when I just come with me for the drop
Yeah, yeah, it's specialised
If the beat is king then I'll be tantamount to regicide
Catalyzing glimpses of another side
Metamorphosize to truly great size
Swat all the rappers buzzing round me like flies
Many try but can't seem to maintain
To be your special guide takes a special kind of brain
You're all the same fake guys with your snake eyes
Scoping out the easiest way
We're gonna try and mesmerise
Who's that chap there at the back spitting his raps to nap?
Dreads are kinda fresh but his rap is sad
He likes his chat in clap track
But the sad fact of the matter is
He really does believe that he's God's fucking gift
Yeah you know the kind of mans I've been talking about
Them mans who walks up in the building, fixes
Gods gifts to all the women and that
Who the fuck is that chap?
Who them guys?
It's the herbalist and specialised
You got to open up your eyes and recognise
Who them boys?
Yes it's the FTP proud to be a part of the Bristol family
Who them guys?
It's the specialised and herbalist with the melody to do this canvases
(Who them boys?)
B-Doll and the FDB
Serenading you with uncanny rap ability
(Then why the fool up?)
So call my bluff and get crushed
With the lyrical stainless steel we're Kiarost
MC stand around mouth open and on plus
FDB we got your suss
Chopping rappers into dust now inhale
Defenestrating so called kings you're all failed
Reflections in your blink that's why you're so billed
And now you're just an empty shell
That's why you scream and yell
'Cause hollow barrels make the most noise
I interview with my grace and poise
You ask, "Who dem boys with dem fancy toys?"
I act coy as I accept the question
Slick styles got you fighting for your girl's affection
Got you questioning your life's direction
How much longer can you sit in the dark
Being inspired by your own direction?
Give me the mic and shut the fuck up
Me buck you up I straight up get stuck up
I'm caught up on a bad man you're locked up
This is hip hop from Bristol's finest rap chaps
With them mouth sides flat caps and fat sacks of grey
Unafraid overweight and underpaid
But still repping to the full with no signs of age
Minimum wage but proud to be true to our roots
So simmer down while you're too big for your boots
It's the herbalist, the specialised, you've got to open up your eyes and recognise (ooh them boys)
Yes, it's the FDB, proud to be a part of this Bristol family (ooh them guys)
It's the specialised and herbalist, with the melody that you just can't resist (ooh them boys)
Be told I'm the FDB, serenading you with uncanny rapability
No point working, I'm sold for surfing
Local urchin, broker's urchin
For some over trips an older person
Get her oldest person, oh she's squirming
Hold my German sausage, watch her grow and burn
When the purrs were searching and you was first
Should've cursed it, don't disturb it
Spook emerging as I flirt with virgins
Hurt their world with my thirst, turn lurking
In the skirt alone, I'm in the nervous burn bits
Certain murky when the fur is furking
Burning from her printers to her quim
And it's wooded dirt, diggler when I serve the gherkin
Turning on the turner till it's bursting
Give a clergy sermon in my birthday suit
Hurking with the way I use the words of Lord Hurting
My perfect reverses, sniffing mess and detergent
Make a mess of the purrs
He gone impress and leave that as a lesson to the impressionable Durst thing
Who is that chap? Call me B-Tiller
Neanderthal or Casanova, the more urban version
There you heard him nurturing in a turban, swinging from the curb in his dirt kegs
But Ekki's got a neck on him, that dirty feck, direct to the curtain
Be respecting for women, his breath when you crash for a questionable sexual diversion
Oopsie, did I wreck the insertion? What you expect?
You're wetter than the otter's pecs in a December immersion
From the message she's hurting'cause I beat out her pussy
Boys respect the rest in that lecherous yearning
It's the herbalist, the specialised, you've got to open up your eyes and recognise
(Ooh dem boys)
Yes, it's the FTP, proud to be a part of this crystal family
(Ooh dem guys)
It's the specialised, the herbalist, with the melodies that you just canvassed
(Ooh dem boys)
We've stolen the FTP, so inedited with uncanny rapability
(Ooh dem guys)
