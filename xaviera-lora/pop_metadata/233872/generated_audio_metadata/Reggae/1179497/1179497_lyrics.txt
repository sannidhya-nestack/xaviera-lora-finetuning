I'm so excited
I'm so delighted
All my life I've been looking for you
I've seen so many things in you
That I've not seen in other girls
Believe me, baby it is true
It's hard to find (hard to find)
I've been looking for you all this time (all this time)
It's hard to find (hard to find)
You came so suddenly into my life
Me it's hard to find (hard to find)
I can't believe this is really you (really you)
Me it's hard to find (hard to find
Seems like my dream has really come true
I can see the look of surprise on your face
Maybe you think that I'm freaking out
Baby I'm saying this and I'm serious
You are my dream girl and there's no doubt
Miss hard to find hard to find
I've been looking for you all this time (all this time)
It's hard to find (hard to find)
You came so suddenly into my life
Me's hard to find (hard to find)
I can't believe this is really you (really you)
Me's hard to find (hard to find)
Seems like my dream has really come true
From the first moment that I saw you
I knew you had to be her
I was pulled like steel towards magnet
I just had to get closer
It's hard to find (hard to find)
I've been looking for you all this time (all this time)
It's hard to find (hard to find)
You came so suddenly into my life
Me's hard to find (hard to find)
I can't believe this is really you (really you)
Me's hard to find
