Crown Productions, MC No Man, it's a reggaeton
Told me why, why you wanna see me cry
Told me why, why you wanna see me suffering baby
Told me why, why why why why why
Told me why, why you wanna see me suffering baby
Told me why, why why why why why
Told me why
I know that you're so beautiful that's why I chose you from the best of the best that I've seen in this world
Girl from the day I met you I've never been happy in my life, I know
You've never loved me but I loved you and I gave you my heart, my soul
Why you wanna make me cry, darling?
Sweet darling, why you wanna make me cry?
Sweet baby, why you wanna make me suffer in my life
Sweet baby, why you do this to me baby
Sweet darling, why you wanna make me cry?
Sometimes I ask myself why you wanna make me cry
Why you wanna make me regret having you in my life
sometimes I call your phone
And another man answer and say, "It's your papa"
Sometimes I call, another man answer and say, is your brother
Sometimes you come back midnight, when I ask where you come from
You never leave pride, you start fighting me back
Sometimes I cry, and I ask myself, why you do this to me baby
Why you make me cry
You should know that I'm a human being, it's true
I love and I got friends
But I give friends time and I give my woman time
Please baby understand I need time
I need love from you baby
Please please please please please please
Babe I need time
I need love from you
Sweet darling
Why you wanna make me cry
Sweet baby, why you wanna make me suffer in my life
Sweet baby, why you do this to me baby
Sweet darling, why you wanna make me cry
Sweet darling, why you wanna make me cry
Sweet baby, why you wanna make me suffer in my life
Sweet baby, why you do this to me baby
Sweet darling, why you wanna make me cry
