Hey, hey, hey, rise up
Rise up, rise up, don't crawl on your knees
You're not a slave to them, you are free
They will put you down to make you feel small
If you're different from them in any shape or form
Feel the negative vibe
you're from a different tribe
Feel the negative vibe'cause you're from a different tribe
There is hate in their mind
They are not colorblind
No, no, they are not colorblind
Feel the negative vibe'cause you're from a different tribe
Feel the negative vibe
Feel the negative vibe'cause you're from a different tribe
Huh, huh, huh
Come on, rise up
Feel the negative vibe'cause you're from a different tribe
Feel it
Unite, unite
To fight off the hate
Life is too short, it's never too late
How many times can you hold out your hand?
As they turn away and deny your rights as a man
Ah, deny your rights
Deny your rights as a man
So feel the negative vibe'cause you're from a different tribe
Feel the negative vibe
you're from a different tribe
Feel the negative vibe
you're from a different tribe
One voice, one voice, yeah
Two shout in their ears
We're all the same, there's nothing to fear
Their blood is red just like yours and mine
Discrimination
Since the beginning of time
Feel the negative vibe'cause you're from a different tribe
Feel the negative vibe'cause you're from a different tribe
Feel that power
Feel the negative vibe
One voice, one voice to shout in their ears
We're all the same, there's nothing to fear
Feel the negative vibe'cause you're from a different tribe
Their blood is red just like yours and mine
Discrimination since the beginning of time
Feel the negative vibe'cause you're from a different tribe
Feel the negative vibe'cause you're from a different tribe
Sit down, sit down, this is my dream
Sit in a tent under an olive tree
With all the tribes all united as one
All sitting together under the rising sun
All sitting together under the rising sun
Then feel the positive vibe
Be united as one world drive
Then feel the positive vibe
United as one world tribe
And then feel the positive vibe
Feel the negative vibe
you're from a different tribe
No, no, no more negative vibe
Be united as one world tribe
No, no, no, negative vibe
Be united as one world tribe
Then feel the positive vibe
Yeah, yeah, feel the positive vibe
United as one will try
United as one will try
Then feel the positive vibe
With no need for war
United as one will try
No need for hate
Feel the negative vibe

Rise up
