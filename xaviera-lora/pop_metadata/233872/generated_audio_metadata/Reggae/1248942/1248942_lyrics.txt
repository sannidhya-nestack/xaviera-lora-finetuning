She wants to be a pop star
Crowd screaming loud
Millions of fans she could make them proud
Light shining bright on the stage so grand
She takes the mic with power in her hands
Dreams in her heart since she was just a child
Now it's coming true, she's running wild
Shining like the sun, dancing in the night
Every note she sings feels so right
From the streets to the stage, she's breaking every cage
With rhythm in her soul, she's on a roll
Hands in the air, echoes of a song
In the beat of the drums we know she belongs
She knows to be loud
Lights shining bright on a stage so grand
She takes the mic with power in her hands
Dreams in our hearts since she was just a child
Now it's coming true she's running wild
Shining like the sun
Dancing in the night
Every note she sings feels so right
From the streets to the stage
She's breaking every cage
With rhythm in her soul she's on a roll
Hands in the air
Echoes of her song in the beat of the drums
She knows she belongs
From the streets to the stage
She's breaking every cage
With rhythm in her soul she's on a roll
She's on a roll
She's on a roll
Guns in the air, echoes of a song in the beat of a drum, she knows she belongs in the deep
Echoes of a song in the beat of a drum, she knows she belongs
