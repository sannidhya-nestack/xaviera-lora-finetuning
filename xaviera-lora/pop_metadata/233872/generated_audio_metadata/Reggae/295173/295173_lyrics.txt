Oh darling, baby, girl
I really miss you whenever you go
And now baby, I just can't get you out of my mind
Snowfakes keep on falling, unknowing the pain
And I can't stand this loneliness and I care again
The nights are just so cold, I wish you were here with me
I wanna kiss your tender lips and wrap your arms around
You got me calling
Your name, you got me calling, calling baby
Your name, love is like the wave that rushed upon the shores
When I say I love you oh girl that's for sure
Life is just so short I just can't count
Those ears will show you when you cry
Girl, I can't count those tears
You got me calling, calling, baby
Your name, you got me calling
Your name, oh well
You got me calling, calling, baby
Your name
Yesterday I called her on the telephone
I heard her in the background saying
I'm not at all
I know it really hurts but girl I'm still in love
Come on back to me oh girl I miss your touch
You got me callin'
Girl you got me callin'
Your name (name)
Oh baby, call me (name, name)
Your name (name)
She got me calling on the phone (name)
She work at home (home)
She even leave a message on the machine at home (name)
She said call me anytime (name)
When I get home (home)
I know the way she's feeling when the nights get cold (home)
Babe (babe)
Come on over
E-A-L-B (Babe) I'm coming over
Eh eh eh darling
Oh girl girl
Eh eh eh darling
You know I miss you so
Eh eh eh darling
Oh girl girl
Eh eh eh darling
You know I miss you so
You heard me calling
Yearning, you got me calling, calling baby
Yearning, snowflakes keep on falling
Unknowing the pain
And I can't stand this loneliness not here again
The nights are just so cold, I wish you were here with me
I wanna kiss your tender lips and wrap your arms around
You got me calling
Your name, you got me calling, calling baby
Your name, you got me calling
Your name, you got me calling, calling baby
Your name, you got me calling
Your name, you got me calling
