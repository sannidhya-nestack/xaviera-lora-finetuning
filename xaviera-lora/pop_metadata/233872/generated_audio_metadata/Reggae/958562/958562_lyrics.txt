Blues away
Wash our blues away
Blues away
Wash our blues away
We keep on hiding
We keep on fighting
But it never goes away, no
You can't deny it
Don't even try
Don't throw your dreams away
Let's all come together
Wash our blues away
Away
Away
Away
It's all about money, ain't that funny
But money won't matter one day, no no
Life is too short, so let's start living
Living for today
Let's all come together
And wash up, lose our way
They only give us enough
To keep us coming back for more
Yeah, that's score, yeah
We call it troubled time
But it's always been the same
Same old game
So we keep on hiding (hiding)
We keep on fighting (fighting)
But it never goes away (never goes away, no)
We can't beat'em
So we might as well join'em (ooh)
Don't throw your dreams away, no, no, no
It's time we come together
And wash our blues away
Let's all come together
And wash our blues away
Erase those flags and borders
Sons and daughters, oh
Wash our blues away
And wash our blues away
Away
Always, always
Wash your blues away
And wash your blues away
