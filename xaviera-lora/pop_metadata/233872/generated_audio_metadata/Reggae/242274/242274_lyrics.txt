Jah coming for the remnant of his people
Jah coming for the remnant of his people
Weh, down inna Babylon a very long time
And I'm bound to come over
Kilo, Jah coming for the remnant of his people
Jah coming for the remnant of his people
Weh, down inna Babylon a very long time
Inna hill amon Babylon and all the islands I've seen
Took her into the cafe-c and they sold the girl for a harlot
Sold the harlot for a bottle of wine
They even sold the boy for a harlot
