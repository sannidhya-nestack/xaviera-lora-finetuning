What's a mug babe?
What's a mug babe?
What's a mug babe?
You are the lifter of my hair
You are my shield and butler
Help me fight all my battles
Even when I lose hope you're my strength
My courage, my everything
Oh yeah
You saw me dead I cannot do it all by myself
You gave me hope when I was hopeless
You pick me up from the mighty clear
You are everything
Why you're in the cold, bossa
Why you're in the cold, bossa
Osama bin, Osama bin, Osama bin, Osama, Osama, Osama bin
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you
For showing me the way
Thought I could make it on my own
Thought I could do it by myself
Till you stepped in, cleaned me up, picked me up, make me a better man
I'm no longer the man I used to be
I'm living in heaven because of you (because of you)
I'm in paradise because of you (because of you)
Everything I have, everything I owe
Everything I ought to be
Gods of you, give it all to you
Yeah, yeah
My love and life, my hope for tomorrow
My everything
With you, with you, with you
My hope for tomorrow
My everything
With you, with you, with you
Why your rain make a bad sign?
Why your rain make a bad sign?
Osama bin, Osama bin, Osama bin, Osama, Osama, Osama bin
I'm living in heaven because of you (because of you)
I'm in paradise because of you (because of you)
My love and life
My hope for tomorrow
My everything
With you, with you, with you
My love and life
My hope for tomorrow
My everything
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
