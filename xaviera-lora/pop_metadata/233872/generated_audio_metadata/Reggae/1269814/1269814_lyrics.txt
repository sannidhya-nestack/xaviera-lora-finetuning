Move your woman
Hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Move your woman
I move your woman
I move your woman
Who the woman, chicken bone in your hand
Will they show if I'm a good or bad man
The future of you and I
Is in your hands
Voodoo woman, holding your voodoo doll
Smelling of ganja and alcohol
Voodoo woman, holding your voodoo doll
Smelling of ganja and alcohol, alcohol
Voodoo woman, hey voodoo woman
We were once true sweethearts
But when you told me it's time to part
You took your doll and stuck pins in my heart
A fuller hit not like cupid's dart
Is that blood or red paint?
She calls to the spirits of dead saints
She calls for the zombies' magic dance
As she falls to the ground in a shaking trance
Voodoo woman, you're a voodoo woman
Call for a priest, call for the pope
Got to tie her to the bed with strong rope
To stop her levitating with Satanism
Priest come quick and carry out the exorcism
Don't et your cross and Bible too
She also practices ancient Hoodoo
Curse your spell and drive the demons out
Beware'cause she will curse, swear and shout
Voodoo woman holding your voodoo doll
Smelling of ganja and alcohol
Voodoo woman holding your voodoo doll
Smelling of ganja and alcohol
Will you ever let me be
Please I beg you to et me
Take out the pins and set me free
Take out the pins and set me free
Set me free, set me free, set me free, set me free
Uduma
Will you ever let me be? Please I beg you to ive me
You, to et me
Take out the pit, and set me free
Take off the pants
And set me free
Voodoo woman
We'll be holding your voodoo doll
Smelling of ganja and alcohol
My voodoo woman
Holding your voodoo doll
Smelling of ganja and alcohol
Smelling of ganja and alcohol
Ha, ha, ha, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, blrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrljjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiijiIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
