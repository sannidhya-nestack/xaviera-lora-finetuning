Well you know it's land, the girls lantern
Who's without equal when it comes to love and affection
I'm just here to take the girls to a higher dimension
Catch my slang (just take it now, just take it now, just take it now, just take it now, just take it now, just take it off now)
Well the girl dem say ya me dem want
So dem invite me to come over
Girl a flex saturated and raw
And a move like a lap dancer
Fling with niggas and then fling with bra
So mi draw fi mi rough rider
And start to push wood inna fire
From upstairs to downstairs and the cellar
From kitchen to bathroom and the sofa
Girl from UK and America
We no care if you a good as or if you a slapper
The girl dem rate me as dem number one lover
Girl I'm so excited and it drive me crazy
My queen my princess much more than a lady
You're sweeter than the roses you're sweeter than the daisies
No if no but no maybes aye
