Inna di city, the heat a bliss
Temperature rising, it be like a criss
Concrete jungle, no breeze to our mix
Global warming got us in a daze
Equest city, too hot to stay
Sun a beat down, no clouds inna di way
Climate change a coming like a thief inna di night
Need to cool it down, gotta put up a fight
Trees are falling, no green in our sight
Pollution and now the air can't catch a flight
Ice caps melting, sea levels rise
Mother Earth now we bureaucrats
E4FCT, too hot to stay
Sun not beat down, no clouds in our way
Climate change a coming like a thief in our night
Need to cool it down, gotta put up a fight
Trees are falling, no green in our sight
Pollution and now the air can't catch a flight
Ice caps melting, sea levels rise
Mother Earth, are we here to reply?
Heatwave city, too hot to stay
Sun a beat down, no clouds in our way
Climate change a coming like a thief in our night
Need to cool it down, gotta put up a fight
We've declined more trees protect the land
Reduce the use, recycle that supply
Sustainable living hand in hand
Together we can make a stand
Heatwave city
Too hot to stay
Sun I'll beat down
No clouds in our way
Climate change is coming like a thief in night and night
Need to cool it down
Gotta put up a fight
Heatwave city
We not give up the fight
Protect the earth make it right
Cool it down
Bring back the light
For a future that's bright

We could plant more trees, protect the land
Reduce, reuse, recycle, that's the plan
Sustainable living hand in hand
Together we can make a stand
Each and every one of us can't live off the fight
Protect the earth, make it right
Cool it down, bring back the light
For a future that's bright, yeah we unite
