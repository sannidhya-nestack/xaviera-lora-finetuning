Sun in the sky, feel the heat
Golden days we would meet
On the beach, hand in hand
Footprints left in the sand
Laughter in the air, tunes we played
Dancing close until the daylight fades
Stars above and the waves below
In the summer of'84, oh
Memories in the breeze
Summer love under trees
Feel the rhythm on shore
Back in the summer of'84
Children play laughter loud
Music echoing through the crowd
Bonfires lighting up the night
Everything just felt so right
Times we had won't disappear
In my heart you are near
Echoes of a distant shore
Whispers of'84
Memories in the breeze
Summer love under the trees
Feel the rhythm on the shore
Back in the summer of'84
Children playing laughter loud
Music echoing through the crowd
Bonfires lighting up the night
Everything just felt so right
Times we had won't disappear
In my heart you are near
Echoes of a distant shore
Whispers of'84
Memories in breeze
Summer love under trees
Feel the rhythm on shore
Back in the summer of'84
Memories in the breeze
Summer love under the trees
Feel the rhythm on shore
Back in the summer of'84
