Baby, I'm crazy
I'm leaving you so far behind
Baby, I'm so lonely
Even when I am by your side
That's why I'm leaving you
Well, I'm leaving you tonight
So don't wait for me'cause I'm already gone, baby
Don't you see me? Well, I move
And I'm known and I'm known and on this cold cloudy day
I'm gonna walk away and I won't look back and I won't even see your face
I was gone so long ago I just thought that you should know that
Baby, I'm crazy
I'm leaving you so far behind
Baby, I'm so lonely
Even when I am by your side
That's why I'm leaving you
Well, I'm leaving you tonight
So, don't wait for me
I'm already gone, baby
Don't you see me
Well, I'm moving on, darling
Don't wait for me
I'm already gone, baby
Don't you hear me as I sing you this song?
