True love is something you have to express enough, you have to feel it
She used to be my everything
She used to be my one and only
Used to dedicate my time
To this girl only
I'm losing a friend
Yes I'm losing a lover
But I've got to let her go
And now I've got to find me another girl
I'm losing a friend
Yes I'm losing a lover but I've got to let her go
And now I've got to find me another girl
She used to mean so much to me more than a lover
She's a friend used to be the one that had to be here with me till the end
But now she's gone and I still cannot comprehend
Oh no I can't pretend
Her reminiscing and the nights we used to chill in the dark remember
The long walks we used to take in the park
But now this girl ya gone and it hurt me to my heart
Stay focused I just won't fall apart
Never before have I felt like how I'm feeling
Now it's like this girl ya came and stole my heart somehow
And even though me know she take it and she's ripping it apart
Still I want to give this girl my all
And when she cry I used to just shrug and bring my shoulder
I used to try my best to be the perfect lover
But now she's gone and that is me I discover
She's a double agent and a cover
Yes I'm losing a friend
Yes I'm losing a lover
But I've got to let her go
I know I've got to find me another girl
I'm losing a friend
Yes I'm losing a lover
But I've got to let her go
I know I've got to find me another girl
She used to mean so much to me, more than a lover she's a friend
Used to be the one I thought would be with me till the end
But now she's gone and I still can't comprehend
Oh no I can't pretend, her reminiscing on the nights we used to
Chill in the dark remember, the long walks we used to take in the park
But now this girl ya gone and it hurt me to my heart
Stay focused I just won't fall apart
Never before have I felt like how I'm feeling
No it's like this girl ya came and stole my heart somehow
And even though me know she take it and she's ripping it apart
Still I want to give this girl my all
And when she cried I used to just run and bring my shoulder
I used to try my best to be the perfect lover
But now she's gone this me a discover she's a
A double agent and a cover
Yes I'm losing a friend
Yes I'm losing a lover
But I got to let her go
I know I've got to find me another girl
I'm losing a friend
Yes I'm losing a lover but I've got to let her go
I know I've got to find me another girl
I'm losing a friend
Yes I'm losing a lover but I've got to let her go
I know I've got to find me another girl
I'm losing a friend
Yes, I'm losing a lover, but I've got to let her go
And no, I've got to find me another girl
