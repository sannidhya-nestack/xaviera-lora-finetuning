Every time I try to help you out
I just don't know how to deal
Every time we try to work things out
I just don't know what to say
Why can't you ever let me in
Without help from you I'll never understand
Night trying was the reason
Wish I knew what's wrong, tell me please
Every time I try to help you out
I just don't know how to deal
Every time we try to work things out
I just don't know what to say
Not for me, that's just me
I know my lonely cubes drive you crazy
Wish I could help you out
Question strikes what we're all about
The touch of timpani, tap back on me
The touch of timpani, tap back on me
