So let's all go out, out to the island (Florida's Island)
Not very far away, we'll load up the boat (Florida's Island)
And sail out there, it's not very far away (Florida's Island)
So let's all go out, out to the island (Florida's Island)
So let's all go out, out to the islands (Florida's Islands)
It's not very far away, we'll load up the boat (Florida's Islands)
It's still out there, it's not very far away (Florida's Islands)
So let's all go out
Out to the island (Florida's Island)
So let's all go out
Out to the island (Florida's Island
Not very far away, we'll load up the boat
(Florida's Island)
And sail out there, it's not very far away
(Florida's Island)
So let's all go out
Out to the islands (Floating in the silence)
Don't let them go out
Out to the islands (Floating in the silence)
They're not very far away
But Lord at the moment (Floating in the silence)
We'll sail out there, it's not far away (Floating in the silence)
So let's go out
Out to the islands (Floating in the silence)
Let's go out
Glory to the islands
They're not very far when we're low to the bottom
And still out there it's not very far when we're silent
