Your avalanche
Bad mind don't stand a chance
Rum in my heart
Mix dark and light and party start
All I need is one more drink
One more till I drunk
Don't tell me I drunk already
Don't tell me I drunk already
One more drink
One more till I drunk
Don't tell me I drunk already
Don't tell me I drunk already
Who drink in the most?
I drink in the most

Who drink in the most?
I drink in the most

I walk up to your bump all a shit on me
We dip on the road and we is an army
We turn a welfare thing to tsunami
Don't care if it's rum or raise a mobly
Now take a shot
Take a shot, take a shot, take a shot, take a shot
Take a shot, take a shot, take a shot, take a, take a, take a, take a, take a
I need one more drink, one more till I drunk
Don't tell me I drunk already, don't tell me I drunk already
One more drink, one more till I drunk
Don't tell me I drunk already, don't tell me I drunk already
Who drinking the most?
I drink in the most
I drink in the most
I drink in the most
Who drink in the most

I drink in the most
I drink in the most
You make your bumper roll like it's a roll on
Don't tell me you're drunk charge you're sober
Half a johnny walk out of a reclusion
Jump up on the road causing confusion
Now take a shot
Take a shot
Take a shot
Take a shot
Take a shot, take a shot, take a shot, take a shot
Take a, take a, take a, take a, take a (All I need is one more drink)
One more'til I drunk
Don't tell me I drunk already
Don't tell me I drunk already
One more drink
One more'til I drunk
Don't tell me I drunk already
Don't tell me I drunk already
Who drink in the most?

Who drink any more? I drink any more

Now jump up jump up jump up jump up jump up jump up
Jump up jump up jump up but don't spill your drink
Jump up jump up jump up jump up jump up jump
Jump up jump up jump up but don't spill your drink
Now wine up wine up wine up wine up wine up wine up
Wine up wine up wine up but don't spill your drink
Wine up, wine up, wine up
