Me say dear my dear
Me just can't seem to find the way
The same old, no joy, no play
I feel like my head has been nobody else's way
From sun up to sun down
I'm stuck in this town
No excitement from before
My heart feeling down
Every morning is the same routine
Wake up, work, eat, sleep, repeat
They say this life ain't no sweet
We need something to make my fear complete
But we don't know where to turn
Seems like my soul is starting to burn
This boredom it make me yearn
For your change for your lesson to learn
So I look to the sky
I'm a star for you I'm so high
But want to spread my wings and fly
Leave behind the same old life
Knees up here, blind there
Make us can't seem to find the way
The same old thing, no joy, no play
But feel like my head is in my body, I swear
But me nah be wrong, me nah be
Me know there's more to life than this
Me go keep pushing through, me go persist
One day me find me bliss
Morning to morning is the same routine
Wake up, work, eat, sleep, repeat
Me say this life ain't no sweet
Me need something make me feel complete
But me no know where to turn
Seems like me suicide will burn
This boredom me make me yearn
For your change, for your lesson to learn
Somewhere up to the sky
I'm a star, fi ask why
But want to spread new wings and fly
Leave behind the same old life
Oh, we said day by day
We just can't seem fi find a way
The same old thing, no joy, no play
But feel like my head has hit nobody else's way
But when I live up, when I breathe
We know there's more to life than this
We'll go keep pushing through, we'll go persist
One day we'll find the bliss
But mi nah give up mi nah quit
Mi know there's more to life than this
Mi go keep pushing through mi go persist
One day mi find mi bliss
Me say day by day
Me just can't see if we'll find a way
The same old thing I try to play
But feel like my head has hit my body I swear
But me nah give up, me nah quit
Me know there's more to life than this
Me go keep pushing through, me go persist
One day me find me bliss
