My toy and glue in the world, it's just me and you
But I don't want you coming to this life and come to a life you're too bad my yo
Because everything too bad get cut off, and the powers, remember that
So I have talked when I get to you Ember half
So me say feel good
Me know you got the powers but you don't have the will
Nuh circumcise me flat me have to live on the hill
That I have to guard nuh don't tell life a thrill
Me go in with me goal and me natural deal
Nuh confuse your brain because you will get killed
Just walk on track right until your goal fulfilled
Tell Babylon say just please be still
Well this is sugar they eat nuh Jack and Jill
So long I've been so wrong
Help me to find my way
So long I've been so wrong
Down on my knees I pray
So long, I've been so wrong
Help me to understand
So long, I've been so wrong
Help me to be a better man
The road is so muddy muddy foggy and dark
Jah give me the light so I and I can walk
Don't want to stumble when I in the dark
Full of the wicked ones who love to talk
Them a planning and they act
Just to cut your arms
That's why me no trust no shadow after dark
Setra give me the strength and the power and the might
So I and I can make this break us
So long, I been so wrong
Help me to find my way
So long, I been so wrong
I on my knees I pray
So long I've been so wrong
Help me so I can understand
So long I've been so wrong
Help me to be a better man
Oyo mwangu tulia nintuku zebwana
Nafsi mwangu tulia nintuku zebwana
(Fa uti yamu iti nukata, nipcha kuzebwana)
(Macho yamu iti nukata, nimpcha zamebwana)
(Mitaka mabatua an kumbaka yad)
(Mfren dema explain se life is hard)
(Is not only to me ka iha love a blood)
Life is hard, because the government don't give the people no regard
Certain place inna Europe, life is hard, because the government don't give the people no regard
Certain place inna Jamaica, life is hard, because the ghetto dem don't care
Certain place inna Africa, life is hard, because the government don't give the people no regard
Don't say the ghetto people dem feel proud
So many tamlin dug inna the ghetto, ghetto people
Only need a chance
It's out of the ghetto, but Marley advance
Out of the ghetto, you send bull advance,'cause
So long, I've been so wrong
Help me to find a way
So long, I've been so wrong
I knock my knees and pray
So long, I've been so wrong
Help me so I can understand
So long, I've been so wrong
Help me to be a better man
So long, I've been so wrong
So wrong, I've been so wrong
Help me to be a better man
Moyo wangu tulia nintuku zebwana
Nafsi wangu tulia nintuku zebwana
Fawuti wangu iluka nintuku zebwana
