Rastafari, in my garden, I listen last night (drums when the people are dancing)
I listen last night, in my garden
Rastafari, in my garden, I listen last night, in my garden
Rastafari in my guideline
They hate the way that I live my life
Don't really care, don't pay them no mind
Feel how I feel when the feelings rise
Herb meditations throughout the night
Vibes with the Rastafari
See what I see through my vision sturdy
Only the strongest survive
One demolition cause I'm a visionary
I listen, I see I
In my guide eye
Rastafari
In my guide eye
I listen lost in your heart
In my guide eye
Rastafari
In my guide eye
Through every time and season
I find the reason
To keep moving on (see that)
No matter what a god, yeah
Rasta man keep moving on
Trotting it from dust till dawn, yeah (yeah man)
Jah opened the seven seals
Praise Rasta for all his love is real
My life is it feel surreal
Tougher than a whole metamorphic steel
Gideon walk on buckle feel
Rasta dash the fire Babylon skin feel
Righteousness must reveal
Joy is more guide than machine
Every time and season
See I find the reason
To keep moving on
No matter what the world
Faster man keep moving on
Charging it from dusk till dawn yeah
I listen now see I
In my guide eye, Rastafari
