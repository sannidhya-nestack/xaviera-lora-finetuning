I hear the voice of the children
They say they're sucking the blood of the dead
I hear their voice, I feel their pain
They say they will fight to the end
Tears of the children
In the new world
Humiliation, tribulation
They're getting lost
In the new world
They've been waste to a generation
Which didn't care for their education
They even blame their history
Which keep them mind in captivity
Tears of the children
In the new world
Humiliation, tribulation
They're getting lost
In the new world
Children of Mother Africa
Millions everywhere in Iwo Shima
They are survivors, can't we see?
Of scientific atrocity
Tears of the children in the new world
Humiliation, tribulation
They're getting lost in the new world
Let's ease the pain together to music
The legacy of the past is still tragic
Children should not be suffered I say
Start dropping those bottles in the way
Tears of the children
In the new world
Humiliation, tribulation
They're getting lost
In the new world
J'entends le cri des enfants
Chante en marchant à l'orient
Leurs voix de liberté, leurs chants
A changé le cœur des méchants
Le cri des enfants de la liberté
N'ont connu que la cruauté
The land is ours
Allah Dhul-Issa
