I be just a rasta man, living in the holy land
I follow the rasta line all the way from Kingston to Manzion
Here is where it all began
The beginning of believing man
Holy holy holy
Rasta rasta rasta
To the holy rasta reggae rock
From your rasta cap red down to your green
Golden red rasta socks
Your roster cap red down to your green
Golden red, roster sucks
Them three little birds they did die
tough gone, he went and died
And all rosters around the world find their way
Into a silent, smokey haze
Life is to live to be free
Not change to racial slavery
Music is stronger than politics
Yeah man, play those holy guitar licks
I said play those holy guitar licks
Make you feel free and float high above
When the prophets feel highly's love
We let Babylon
Full of tears, we crossed the Jordan to be here
Now I no cry,'cause Rastafari and I
Now I no cry,'cause Rastafari and I
No I no cry,'cause Rastafari and I
Holy, holy, holy
Rasta, rasta, rasta
To the holy rasta, reggae rock
To the holy rasta, reggae rock
Hold your rasta cap right down
To your green, golden, red rasta socks
Rasta socks
My Rasta heart, be joyful and free
Full of love for all those that follow me
Ethiopian brothers, you can make it though it's far
Carry the ark with you from Addis Ababa
Praying to the Almighty on high
From His Jah Kingdom in the sky
Praying to the Almighty on high
From His Jah Kingdom in the sky
Holy, holy, holy
Rasta, rasta, rasta
Mmm, holy, holy, holy
Rasta, rasta, rasta
Mmm, you're the holiest of the red ones
From your rasta cap right down
To your green, gold and red rasta socks
Holy, holy, holy
Rasta, rasta, rasta
Do that holy rasta way rock
From your rasta cap right down
To your green, golden, red rasta socks
