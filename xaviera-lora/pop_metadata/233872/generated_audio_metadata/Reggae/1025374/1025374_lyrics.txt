Every time I see
You're not walking close to me
It's another day
I let you get away
Have you heard of me?
I'm the new guy on the streets
I do not pretend
I wanna be more than your friend
You have seen me now
I know I'm the talk of the town
It's difficult for me
And it's been this way for weeks
You must understand
That I want to be a man
And it's plain to see
That with you I live the dream
I'm calling your name
I didn't know it, it just came
Oh, to me in my sleep
You are my world, my energy, oh
You have made it here
I can't believe you did appear
One day I will show
All my love, see how it grows
I'm calling your name
I didn't know it, it just came
To me in my sleep
You are my world, my energy
Oh woah
I'm calling your name
I didn't know it, it just came
To me in my sleep
You are my world, my energy, oh woah
