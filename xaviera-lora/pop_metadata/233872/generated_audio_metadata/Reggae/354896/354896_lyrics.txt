I don't know what I'm gonna do, baby, baby, without you
Without you there is no day in my life
Without you there is no warmth in my life
Baby, I don't know what I'm gonna do
I don't know what, I don't know what I'm going through
Just the pain I feel, girl, without
Without you right beside my heart, without you
Like the winter turns to spring
Oh, it's like the way the world turns too
Like the morning dew from the rain
Spreading all the love, the flake for you
I can't remember how it was
All I can remember is what we used to do
Now I know
Now I know how it is to be alone
To be alone I'm telling you
But I just don't know what I'm gonna do
I don't know, I don't know but I'm
I know I can't go on living without you
Oh, I don't know what I'm going to do
Baby, I wish you could hear me'cause I'm begging you
I just can't live, I can't live without you
If you could hear me call, callin' you
Don't you know I'd be beggin' for your return?
If you could feel what I feel
You know I'm tellin' you I've learned, I've learned
What it's like to be without you
Lord, what I'm going through
Mmm, I don't know what
I don't know what I'm going to do
Got a feeling in my soul, I know it's true
I just can't live, I just can't live without you
Baby, oh baby, I'm telling you
I don't know if I can, oh
I just want you to hold me once more
Once more, it's true, it's true, it's true
Like the weather turns into a summer's day
From a storm that passes by
Like the world grows into a bloom of love
Of the spring of a lover's eyes
Now I know what it is that I've been going through
I'm telling you, telling you
I just don't know what I'm gonna do
Oh baby, don't you hear me when I say
Close eyes
Lord knows, I knows I can't go on without you
I know, I know, I know, oh, oh, oh
