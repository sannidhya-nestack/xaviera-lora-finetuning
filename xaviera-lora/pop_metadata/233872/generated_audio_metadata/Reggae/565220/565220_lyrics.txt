There's a lot of ways for moving on
There are many ways to be strong
There's a light for fear to shade away
The only way I know to live another day
To be classified (to be classified) in the precious sun
From me to you
Father to son
Mother to daughter
Everyone
On an ending note
I've just begun
I'm hoping
And dreaming
To face a brand new day
And I'm longing
Believing
That we can find our way
There are many ways to open your mind
In times we've shown we can find
A sense of direction from the truth we share
To clear away this dismal glare
There are many ways (there are many ways) of grooving on
Many things, oh, can go wrong
These times, oh these times
Do you mind? I care
So many ways
To share the fear
I'm hoping and dreaming
To face a brand new day
And I'm longing, believing
That we can find our way
Oh yes, I'm hoping and dreaming
To face a brand new day
And I am longing, longing, believing
That we can find our way
Oh no, yeah, yeah, yeah
