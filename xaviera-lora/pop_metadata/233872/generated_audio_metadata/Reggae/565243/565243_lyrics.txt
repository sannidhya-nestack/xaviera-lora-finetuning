Now their ships are sailing, we can't stop it now
But you can hit the water anyhow
Just remember pretty blue
Don't tell a story always true
It may just be a long way down, oh, oh, oh
I don't know who said so
When it must have been so long ago
Yesterday don't matter now
This I say so
Tomorrow we will never know
Today is all we've got
Let's live and howl
Give all the love you can
Give all the love my friend
Give all the love you can
And never stop it (never stop)
No never stop it (never stop)
Never stop it, never stop it now
Mine is yours and yours is mine
Well, we must have found divine design
So good to free the burden from within
From the law of consequence
It must have been my seventh sense
To never worry going back again
I'm gonna give all the love I can
Give all the love my friend
Give all the love I can
And never stop it (never stop)
No never stop it (never stop)
Never stop it, never stop it now
Give all the love, I say give all the love
Give all the love, I say give all the love
From the depths of your soul
Give all the love
No longer should you wait
To give all the love
It was a positive not negative in rhythm and motion
Moving up the ladder to a sense of devotion
Keeping up the love is the right conclusion
Giving all the love and ever longing connection
Never stop it
Never stop, no never stop it
Never stop, never stop it
Never stop it now
Never stop, and never stop it
Never stop, no no never stop it
Never stop, never stop it
Never stop it now
Never stop and never stop it
Never stop, never stop it
Never stop, never stop it
Never stop it, never never never
No, no, oh no, oh no
