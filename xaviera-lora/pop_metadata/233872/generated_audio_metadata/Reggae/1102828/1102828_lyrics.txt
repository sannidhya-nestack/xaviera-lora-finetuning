A moment of silence
Can I get a moment of silence
Woah woah
For all our brothers and our friends we've lost
Along the way
A moment of silence
We wanna let you know that though you're gone
We'll still remember
Always in our heart
That we missed you when we wished that you're still here with us now
But God knows the better
For every one of us who lost somebody who is out there
Raise it up now as we say
Can I get a moment of silence
Can I get a moment of silence
Can I get a moment of silence
Can I get a moment of silence
Can I get a moment of silence?
Can I get a moment of silence?
Moment of silence
For all our brothers and our sisters
We lost along the way
Whoa
You see life's journey
It's so unpredictable
But as we go on
Prepare for the inevitable
See, but nothing can prepare you
For the loss of someone new
So dear
It's so painful, yeah
And so whenever you are out today
We raise this glass in remembrance
Of our loved ones out there
Though you were gone
But forever in our hearts, oh
Can I get a
Moment of silence (moment of silence)
Can I get a moment of silence (for the ones we've lost our love)
Can I get a moment of silence (we love you)
Can I get a moment of silence (we miss you)
But we have to go on (can I get a moment of silence)
So painful (can I get a moment of silence)
Moment of silence
Wherever you are
We love you and we miss you
Dedicated to everyone who's lost a long one along the way
Moment of silence for the ones we lost
