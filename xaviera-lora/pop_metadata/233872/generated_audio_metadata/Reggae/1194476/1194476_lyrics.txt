I see that you looking down
Well I got a message for you
I see you wearing that crown
You're looking round for something to do
You can chase it away
Make it go
Do not delay
Let today be the day
Make a note
It's the day you were saved
Saved you don't have to worry
Saved no need to be sorry
Saved nobody is wanting
Saved remember those who love you
I hear you read the wrong thing
Somebody to you has nothing nice
But you've the power to think
Think how that power could make it right
Maybe they had a bad day
Say nobody listened to them
And they have something to say
So then they go online to make friends
You can chase it away
Make it go
Do not delay
Let today be the day
Make a note
It's the day you will say
Save you don't have to worry
Save no need to be sorry
Save nobody is wanted
Save remember those who love you
Remember those who love you
Remember those who love you
I see that you're looking down
Well I got a message for you
I see you wearing that frown
You're looking right for something to do
You can chase it away
Make it go
Do not delay
Let today be the day
Make it known it's the day you were saved
Saved you don't have to worry
Saved no need to be sorry
Saved nobody is wanting
Saved remember those who love you
Remember those who love you
Remember those who love you
Remember those who love you
Remember those who love you
