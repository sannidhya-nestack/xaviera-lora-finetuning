Yeah man, it's your limb to the angel, alongside the overcomer

And that's King Jesus in heaven, no other man you know
He taught us to pray you know, in this manner
Our Father, Yah, what in heaven now
Hallowed be Thy Name
Our Father Yah, what in heaven now
All of me is thy name

Thy will must be done on earth and at the sun
