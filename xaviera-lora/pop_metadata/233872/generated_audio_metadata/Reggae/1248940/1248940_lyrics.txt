Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Early morning sunshine and bright
Feel the breeze cool through night, yeah
Work hard but the market lies
No chance to get rich inside
Island rhythm keeps me strong
Singing my carefree song, yeah
Life ain't right but we get along
No chance to get rich if you're wrong
We dance all night
On the stars so bright
Money tight but we did alright
No chance to get rich in this fight
Sea waves crashing on the shore
Barefoot dreams we can't ignore, yeah
Simple life but we want more
No chance to get rich that's for sure
Black steel drums playing sweet melodies
Lost in dreams of what could be, yeah
Can't find the sun or the sea
No chance to get rich but we feel free
We dance all night on the stars so bright
Money tight but we feel alright
No chance to get rich if it bites
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Early morning sunshine bright, oh
Feel the breeze cool tonight, yeah
Work hard but my pocket lies
No chance to get rich in sight, oh
Violent rhythm keeps me strong
Singing my carefree song, yeah
Life ain't right but we get along
No chance to give it still belong
We dance all night
On the stars so bright
Money tight but we alright
No chance to give it in this fight
Oh
Oh my love, yeah
Early morning sunshine's bright, oh
Feel the breeze cool through like death
Oh carnival
