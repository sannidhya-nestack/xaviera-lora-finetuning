It's six of one, a half dozen of another
Treat yourself like you had a twin brother
Two steps forward, two steps back
You'll end up where you started at
It's six of one, a half dozen of another
Rain is water and water is rain
You can bet you're gonna get wet either way
Take a shortcut or take the long way round
You won't get lost, X marks the spot on the very same ground
It's six of one, a half dozen of another
Treat yourself like you had a twin brother
Two steps forward, two steps back
You'll end up where you started at
It's six of one, a half dozen of another
Ten pennies, two nickels or a dime
Get enough, they all add up to a dollar sign
Whether you crawl on your knees, walk or run
No matter the pace, the race isn't over'til it's done
It's six of one, a half dozen of another
Treat yourself like you had a twin brother
Two steps forward, two steps back
You'll end up where you started at
It's six of one, a half dozen of another
Circle left or circle right
You'll come full circle every time
It's six of one, a half dozen of another
Treat yourself like you had a twin brother
Two steps forward, two steps back
You'll end up where you started at
It's six of one, a half dozen of another
Two steps forward, two steps back
You'll end up where you started at
It's six of one, a half dozen of another
It's six of one, a half dozen of another
It's six of one, a half dozen of another
Treat yourself like you had a twin brother
