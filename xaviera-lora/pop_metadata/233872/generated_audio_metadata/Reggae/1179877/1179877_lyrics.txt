Whenever you come close to me
The vibes get so strong
(Shoo-doo-doo)
Know these feelings, they can't be wrong
(Shoo-doo)
It's been you all along
(Shoo-doo-doo)
And I just want to rock your world
(Rock it, rock it)
Baby come and be my girl
Come and let me rock you world
Believe me when I say
Come into my life
And make my dream come true
And I will love you
With all my heart
You will be my queen
The only one for me
We'll stay together
Never apart
And I just want to rock you world
Baby come and be my girl (be my girl)
Come and let me rock your world, oh yeah
Believe me when I say
And I just want to rock your world
Baby come and be my girl
Come and let me rock your world
Believe me when I say
With you being around me
To brighten my gloomy days
You make a difference in my life
In so many ways
And I just want to rock your world
Baby come and be my girl (be my girl)
Come and let me rock your world (rock it, rock it)
Believe me when I say
And I'm gonna rock your world (rock it, rock it)
