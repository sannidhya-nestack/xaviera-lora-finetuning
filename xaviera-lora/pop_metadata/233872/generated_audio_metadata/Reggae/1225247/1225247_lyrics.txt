Thug Mansion, not a girl song
Woo, ice cold, yeah you should know
Girl shake, shake your bam bam
Like a cheerleader with a pam pam
You got the body of a champion
Pussy so fatty now your tongue, tongue, tongue, tongue
Eat it like drum, drum, drum, drum
Wrap her pam pam
Happy a bad girl inna the Thug Mansion
A drop dress like the bridge over London
Bad girl a wine up fi bad man
Hey we inna the Thug Mansion
A play bad song with a couple bad girl
High grade alcohol
We a gate girl before pen pal
Drive them like rental
Every girl a bubble girl a jiggle
Tell me say dem love it when me put it in the middle
Pose it up and make sure wiggle
Bumble cloud girl ya boom boom tighten it little

Wine up till the bed broke
Girl your skin clean and your breast dem stiff legs bow to me well talk
Turn back way girl take fuck
Girl shake, shake your bam bam

You got the body of a champion
Pussy so fat inna your tongue, tongue, tongue, tongue
Beat it like drum, drum, drum, drum

Happy a bad girl inna the thug mansion
A drop dress like the bridge over London
Bad girl a wind up fi bad man
She body inna bed
Missy hearing when she open her leg
She turn the throne and then she go up on her head
The girl ya bad like the return of the trade

Wine, wine, wine, wine
Wine, wine, wine, wine, wine, wine, wine
Girl shake, shake your bam bam
Like a cheerleader with a pam pam
You got the body of a champion
Pussy so fat inna your tongue, tongue, tongue, tongue
Beat it like drum, drum, drum
Rap a pam pam
Happy a bad girl inna the Thug Mansion
A drop dress like the bridge over London
Bad girl a wind up fi bad man
