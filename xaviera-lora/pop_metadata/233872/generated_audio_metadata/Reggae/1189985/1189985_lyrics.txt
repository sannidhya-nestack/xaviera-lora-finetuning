I've got my coat pulled down
And my collar up
Oh no
I've got a voice that you say
Is always abrupt
Oh no
But I still hold a bright light for you
I only deal with coincidence
I've got a dream that makes no sense
Under a moon that is shining so blue
I was the man that lost my way
Maybe I'll come back to fight another day
Maybe you'll think
I went to bed, but you returned to me an hour of my need
When I will need, need, need
When I will need, need, need
I didn't like that man
That they said I was
Oh no
I got my excuses but it is all because
Oh no
Of this dying love for you
I only drink when my mouth runs dry
And I will stop the day I die
Under a moon that is shining so blue
I was the man
That lost my way
Maybe I'll come back to fight another day
Maybe you'll think
I went to bed
But you returned to me in an hour of my need
When I will need, need, need
When I will need, need, need
You turned my head and the tide
You gave me a place to hide
No one else in the world will do
Under the moon that's shining blue
I was the man that lost my way
Maybe I'll come back to fight another day
Maybe you'll think
I went to bed
But you returned to me in an hour of my need
When I will need, need, need
When I will need, need, need
Was in full bloom when they cut
They cut me down, oh no
In the tomb while the world went
The world went around, oh no
Not every word I have said is true
I'm walking tall along the tightrope
I'm viewing life through a periscope
Under a moon that is shining so blue
I was the man that lost my way
Maybe I'll come back to fight another day
Maybe you'll think I went too big
But you returned to me in an hour of my need
I was the man
That lost my way
Maybe I'll come back to fight another day
Maybe you'll think
I went too big
But you returned to me in an hour of my need
When I will need
Need
Need
When I will need
Need, need, when I will
Need, need, need, need, need, need
When I will need, need, need, when I will need
