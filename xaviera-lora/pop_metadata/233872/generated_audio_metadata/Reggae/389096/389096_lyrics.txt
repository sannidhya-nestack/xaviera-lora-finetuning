Screwing away, oh I'll miss her
Stacking up and leaving it to light
I'll never et the way she smiled
Her beautiful voice, she was so great as hell
Screwing away, I'll think of her everyday
Yeah I'll never et you need your way
Screwing away, I'll think of her everyday
Yeah I'll never et you need your way
Met her back in'95
I saw her every day at the school yard
I'll never et the way she smiled
Her beautiful voice, sweet so curious
Screwing away, I think of her everyday
Yeah, I'll never et you initially
Screwing away, I think of her everyday
Yeah, I'll never et you initially
Met her back in'95
I saw her every day at the school yard
I'll never et the way she smiled
Her beautiful voice, she's your greatest
She's moving that way, I'll think of her every day
I'll never et, she'll need your ease
She's moving that way, I'll think of her every day
I'll never et, she'll need your ease
