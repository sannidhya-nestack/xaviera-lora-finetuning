I'm a sing girl, I feel left being worn
See me pon the mic, me say me just can't perform
I'm a sing girl, I feel left being worn
See me pon the mic, me say me just can't perform
I feel left me so so dry and so naïve but
Every level so so cool and so unstable
You should tell me things that start make me wonder
And how this love can really be over
Find an egg at night, walks in the moonlight
Take you to the tourist town, buy you what you like
Treat you like a queen
Everyday hell night come and sing girl
Are you full of fear and goanna
See me pony make me seem I just can't perform
Come and sing girl
Are you full of fear and goanna
See me pony make me seem I just can't perform
Now was it true things that you used to tell me
Tell me never hurt you
And tell me never leave
Tell me that you love you how it's true love for real
Hugging and squeezing every time that you feel
Kissing and caressing all through the night time
Watch it what if they put a smile upon my mind
How love can really be so blind
Come and sing girl
Or if you left me and go on
See me pon the mic me see me just can't perform
Come and sing girl
Or if you left me and go on
See me pon the mic me see me just can’t perform
And when it comes to you ma let me friends stand behind
Me never ever dis ya
Me always on time
Take you all the places that you really wanna go
Grabbing my hand love affection you all a show
Now tell me girl
I said me do me what fi do
Come and sing girl
Or if we left we in Guana
See me funny make me seem a just can't breath on
Come and sing girl
Or if we left we in Guana
See me pony make me see me just can't perform
I full of me soul so dry and so not able
I full of me soul so cold and so unstable
You see to me things that start make me wonder
And how our love can really be over
Find a nigga night walks in the moonlight
Take him to the jury stand buy you what you like
Treat you like a queen everyday and night
Come and see me girl I full of green and gold
See me pony make me see me just can't perform
Come and see me girl I full of green and gold
See me pon your mind, me see me just can't breathe from
Girl now what's the truth, things that you used to tell me
You tell me never hurt you, you tell me never leave
You tell me that you love you, how it's true love for real
Hugging and squeezing every time that you feel
Kissing and caressing all through the night time
Watch you while you sleep with a smile by my mind
Now how could love really be so blind come missing girl
Are you full of fear and go on
