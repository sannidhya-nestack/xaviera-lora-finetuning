Oh there you are, you brought some sunshine
Into my life, this gloomy day
I feel so happy, just to see you my baby
It's so nice that you are here
Let's get going
Turn on the trills
For I want you loving
In the wheel of the wheel
Take me flying
Above the clouds
And into orbit
Oh you're so good
My genie of love
My genie of love
My genie of love
My genie of love
You're always around when I need you the most
You're like a fairy coming whenever I wish
You make my days so full of joy
You're so nice to be with
You keep pushing me on
Let's get going
Turn on the trills
For I want you loving
Do it a-dween
Take me flying
Above the clouds
And into orbit
Oh you're so good
My genie of love
My genie of love
My genie of love
My genie of love
Oh when you kiss me
It knocks me out
To land a fantasy
Where all is magic
When you make love to me
It gives me the chills
Excitement and magic
Fills me with love
Let's get going
Turn on the trills
For I want you loving
Do it, oh do it
Take me flying
Above the clouds
And into orbit
Oh you're so good
My genie of love
Genie genie genie
My genie of love
Genie of love
My genie of love
Genie genie genie
My genie of love
