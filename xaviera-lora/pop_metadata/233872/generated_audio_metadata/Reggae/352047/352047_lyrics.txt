Oh dear, we have seen
While the earth once cleaned
Stop the machine
There's no escape from the destruction
We've seen our fate, there's no protection
We stand with backs against the wall
We knew someday that Babylon would fall
Oh, oh, dear, we have seen
Mother Earth once clean, stop the machine
We've done it wrong, lost our connection
Might be too late for resurrection
Such a dubious distinction
We paved the road to our extinction
Oh, oh dear
We have seen
Mother Earth once clean
Stop the machine
Oh, oh, dear
We have seen
Mother Earth wants clean
Stop the machine
