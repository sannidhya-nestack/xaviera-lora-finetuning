When the streets of Kingston town
Feel the beat rolling wild
Sun is high, drums are loud
Every turn a joyful smile
People dancing all around
Music flows like the sea
Catchy vibes easy found
Life is sweet feeling free
Kingston groove moving slow
Every heart sings along
Reggae tunes all night long
Feel the love in the soul
Colours bright markets feel
Laughter echoes everywhere
Night falls lights on the hill
Warm breeze through the summer air
Friends and family gather round
Harmony in the air
Reggae rhythm wears the crown
Peace and love we all share
Kingston groove moving strong
Every heart sings out along
Reggae tunes all night long
Feel the love in the song
Colours bright, markets filled
Laughter echoes everywhere
Night falls, lights on the hill
Warm breeze through the summer air
Friends and family gather round
Harmony in the air
Reggae rhythm wears the crown
Peace and love we all share
Kingston groove moving strong
Every heart sings along
Reggae tunes all night long
Feel the love in the song
