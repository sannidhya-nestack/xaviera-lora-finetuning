I just want to live and give thanks and praise unto the most high
Because I feel it for the people there
So I just say a prayer
After my gospel (humming)
And to the Lord I'm gonna pray
Guide and protect me along thy way
Me no matter what them do
Me no matter what them say
Only with the Lord I'm gonna stay
And to the Lord I'm gonna pray
Guide and protect me all along thy way
Me no matter what dem do
Me no matter what dem say
Only with the Lord I'm gonna stay
Aye
Dem set up dem trap but dem can't trap aye
Want stab me inna me back but dem can't stop aye
Fly low fly high still dem can't catch high
Me a one Nazarene we never stop try
Tumbling black inna me way but me never stop pray
One Psalms a day chase the devil away
None of the weak it can stand up when it's judgement day
Man a garden to you work you shall collect your pay
To the Lord I'm a pray
Guide and protect me along thy way
No matter what them do me no matter what them say
Only with the Lord I'm a stay
And to the Lord I'm a no pray
Guide and protect me along thy way
Me no matter what them do
Me no matter what them say
Only with the Lord I'm a no stay
Don't spit inna the sky
It will fall back to you eye
No sit down and wait until the river run dry
Step up and go forward like a piece of the pie
The love of the almighty we mustn't deny
Inna this trouble run ya don't stop try
If you keep the Lord's sayings then you will never die
Of the powers, the powers of the most high
Keep God's commandment it will lift you high
To the Lord I'm anna pray
Guide and protect me along thy way
Mi no matter what dem do, mi no matter what dem say
Only with the Lord, I'm gonna stay
Unto the Lord, I'm gonna pray
Him guide and protect me along the way
Mi no matter what dem do, mi no matter what dem say
Only with the Lord, I am honest there, aye
Me say dem a cross church
Now dem end up in a earth
Shoulda been giving thanks and praise to who create heaven and earth
Dem rise up inna dey morning hungry and a curse
You fi give thanks, say life make us, you is not the worst
Some can't find water, frequent dem thirst
I a pray fi dey youth dem we inna de desert
From righteousness unno mustn't divert
Stay with the Lord he will work things out
To the Lord I'm gonna pray
Him guide and protect me along thy way
Me no matter what them do
Me no matter what them say
Only with the Lord I'm gonna stay
And to the Lord I'm gonna pray
Him guide and protect me along thy way
Me no matter what them do
Me no matter what them say
Only with the Lord
I'm honest there
After me gone so
Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-mm-hmm
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Obstacle inna mi way but mi nah stop pray
Then one Psalms a day trace the devil away
None of the wicked can stand up when it's judgement day
Now according to your work you shall get your pay
To the Lord I'm a nah pray
Guide and protect me along the way
Mi nah matter what dem do

Only with the Lord I'm a nah stay
