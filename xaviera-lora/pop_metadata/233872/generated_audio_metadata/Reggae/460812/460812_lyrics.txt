There's been an infestation in our quiet little town
Now I ain't prejudicial but I don't want zombies around
Zombies are so messy they lose their limbs and head
Can't have a conversation
All they do is say
Zombies on street corners
Zombies everywhere
Zombies shopping at the mall
Zombies hanging around town squares
Now I'm not being nasty
But they don't smell so good
And they're bringing down the values
In our neighborhood
If you need some lifting
They can't pull their weight
Let's be really honest
There's no fun today
Zombies on street corners
Zombies everywhere
Zombies shopping at the mall
Zombies hanging around town squares
We don't know where they come from
But they really got to go
They're causing all sorts of trouble
Something's gone to blow
Oh no
Try to give them leeway
Especially since they're dead
But we don't want the zombies
To multiply and spread
We try to reason with them
But they don't seem to hear
Most of them don't even
Have a mouth or ears
Zombies are so messy
They lose their limbs and head
Can't have a conversation
All they do is say
Zombies on street corners
Zombies everywhere
Zombies shoppin' at the mall
Zombies hangin'round town square
Zombies on street corners
Zombies everywhere
Zombies shoppin' at the mall
Zombies hangin' round down square
Zombies everywhere
We don't want'em'round no more
Bye zombies
