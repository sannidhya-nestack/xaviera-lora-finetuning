Funnel, body surfing on a waterbed
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Yeah, yeah
Rubbing on suntan lotion
Singing to a Beach Boys tune (to the Beach Boys tune)
Floating on a king sized ocean in a blue bedroom lagoon
The water sure feels inviting beneath this satin beach
So turn the ceiling fan on high and let's ride the ocean breeze
Body surfing on a water bed
Just the two of us hanging tight
Moving at the speed of love
Holding our breath
Leaving 9 to 5 behind us, tonight's gonna find us
Making waves we'll never et
Bodies surfing on a waterbed
Rocking in the wake of the breakers rolling in with the tide
Searching for Jimmy's lost shaker of salt
Sipping a tequila sunrise
Next to hot tub polo
It's our favorite water sport
And it's okay if we wipe out
Cause we'll wash up on the floor
Body surfing on a water bed
Just the two of us hangin' tight
Movin' at the speed of love, holdin' our breath
Leavin' nine to five behind us, tonight's gonna find us
Makin' waves we'll never et, body surfin' on a waterbed
And there's a simple explanation
For all these good vibrations
And cool sensations
Body surfing on a water bed
Just the two of us hanging tight
Moving at the speed of love
Holding our breath
Leave a nine to five behind us, the nine's gonna find us
Making waves we'll never et
Bodies surfing on a waterbed
Making waves we'll never et
Bodies surfing on a waterbed
