Hey brother why you look so down
Seems like you were to start upside down
Are you feeling sorry for yourself
You gotta move on while life still goes on
Rise and shine
Get up, fall in the line
Rise and shine
Everything is gonna work out fine
Rise and shine
Don't waste precious time to worry
Rise and shine
If you waste time you'll be sorry
Hey sister, why you look so blue?
Seems like you're having a very hard time
Cheer up, it's not the end of the world
Go on, go have yourself some fun, yeah
Rise and shine
Get up fall in the line
Rise and shine
Everything is gonna work out fine
Rise and shine
Don't waste precious time to worry
Rise and shine
If you waste time you'll be sorry
Rise and shine
Get up following the light
Rise and shine
Everything is gonna work out fine
Rise and shine
Though it's precious time to worry
Rise and shine
If you waste time you'll miss a ray
The world is like a mirror
Reflecting what you do
And if your face is smiling
It smiles right back at you, yeah
Rise and shine
Get up, fall in the light
Rise and shine
Everything is gonna work out fine
Rise and shine
Don't waste precious time to worry
Rise and shine
If you waste time you'll be sorry
Rise and shine
Get up, call in the line, rise and shine
Everything is gonna work out fine, rise and shine
Don't waste precious time to worry, rise and shine
If you waste time you'll be sorry, rise and shine
