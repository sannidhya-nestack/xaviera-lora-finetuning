Always thought he'd be a daughter
That he's a boy much like his father
And his smile's on my shoulder
Hope you'll do the same when he's older
He reminds me of my father
A warm and sleepy giant
See him carry me up the mountain
To look down upon the hollow and the river
Dad, don't let go
Here's a face I've known forever
Warm and sleepy baby
An annunciation came to me
Said your love for a woman will repeat the circle
Always thought he'd be a daughter
Glad he's a boy just like his father
And he smiles on my shoulder
Hope you do the same when we're older
