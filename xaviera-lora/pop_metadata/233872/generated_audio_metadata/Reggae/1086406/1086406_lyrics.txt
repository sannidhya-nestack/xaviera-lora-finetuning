You give me a love that never shakes or trembles in any way
Confident on all its many levels it could never fade away
These love particles of our souls mesh and concretely exist in reality
No form of separation will ever get in our way
Strong and sure standing firm and tall
Facing all the good and the bad and all the odds
All the odds of this love weather
Our love will never fall I say
So that is why I'm giving thanks and praising
For this just said love right away
So that is why I'm giving thanks and praises
For this dress and love I set
So regal in your statue when
You walk it takes my breath away
Purest love of loves for a smile
You can take my pain away
Our eyes locking on verbal communicating
So patiently in what you say to me
It's our own language and we speak it
In our own way
Strong and sure standing firm and tall
Facing all the good and abiding all the odds
All the odds of this love weather
Our love will never fall I say
So that is why I'm giving thanks and praises
For this trust and love right away
So that is why I'm giving thanks and praises
For this dress and love I said
Said no I'm thanking Jah
For making you so perfect genetically
So that it matches me
So now we're twisted and joined by love born so strong you see
So that is why I'm giving thanks and praises
For this just said love right away
So that is why I'm giving thanks and praises
For this just said love I say
So that is why I'm giving thanks and praises
For this dress and love right away
So that is why I'm giving thanks and praises
For this dress and love I say
Ooh, ooh, ooh
