Sun is high, it's so bright
Feels so good, feels just right
Cool breeze, raise the trees
In my head, got my dreams
Life is sweet, summer heat
Move my feet to the beat
In the sand, golden rains
We are free, just you and me
Like ice in the sunshine
We're melting away
Love so warm, here we stay
Love ice in the sunshine, the dance that we play
Summer love, day by day
Regular vibes, hard to lie
Living folks, we alright
In the light, hold me tight
Everything's gonna be alright
Feel the warmth in the air
Happy moments we share
Sunset glow, love for sure
Together we'll go, we'll go
Like ice in the sunshine
We're melting away
Love so warm, here we stay
Like ice in the sunshine, dance and we play
Summer love, day by day
Like ice in the sunshine, we're melting away
Love so warm, here we stay
Like ice in the sunshine, dance and we play
Summer love, day by day
