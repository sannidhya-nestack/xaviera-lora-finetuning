And on your knees and jam, jam
Control of your banner, you act like a sauna
You call for some firewood, I come with the lava
Gas on your bandana, thank God for your mother
Waste looser than looser, girl
You starting up trouble when you move it
To the left, to the left, to the left, to the left
To the left, to the left, to the left
Now to the right, to the right, to the right
To the right, to the right, to the right
To the right, get out my sight
Make way for the jam, make way for the jam
Make way for the jam, and on your knees and jam, jam
Make way for the jam, make way for the jam
Make way for the jam, and on your knees and jam, jam
Look back for the jam, look back for the jam
Look back for the jam, and on your knees and jam, jam
Make way for the jam, make way for the jam
Make way for the jam, and on your knees and jam, jam
Wasteline and sucker run the world
A juve some man dem grab a girl
Waste line and soak around the world
A juve some man dem grab a girl

Make way for the jam, make way for the Jam
Make way for the jam, and on your knees, and Jam Jam
