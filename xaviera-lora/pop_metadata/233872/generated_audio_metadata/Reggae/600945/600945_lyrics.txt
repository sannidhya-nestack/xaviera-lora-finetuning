Lot of mercy, lot of mercy, lot of mercy, lot of mercy, lot of mercy, lot of mercy
Open your mind and look within
That's the way you're living
Buddha bhai, Buddha bhai bhai bhai
Open your mind and look within
That's the way you're living
Buddha bhai, Buddha bhai bhai bhai
Open your mind and look within
That's the way you're living
Buddha bhai, Buddha bhai bhai bhai
Open your mind and look within
That's the way you're living
Pull it up, pull it up, pull it up, uh-uh
Pull it up, pull it up, pull it out, uh-uh
Shake your body left, shake your body right
Shake your body two, shake your body one
Hear this, hear this
All the girls are dancing to the music
Checking their bodies, checking their hair
And they all are laughing and singing
All are having fun, I swear
Open your mind and look within
That's the way you're living
Put a bite, put a bite, bite, bite
Open your mind and look within
That's the way you're living
Put a bite, put a bite, bite, bite
Open your mind and look within
That's the way you're living
Put a bite, put a bite, bite, bite
Open your mind and look within
That's the way you're living
All the girls are dancing to the music
Checking their bodies, checking their hair
And they all are laughing and singing
All are having fun as well
