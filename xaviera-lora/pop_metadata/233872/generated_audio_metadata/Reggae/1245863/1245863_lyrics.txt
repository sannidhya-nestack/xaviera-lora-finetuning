I'm dancing on the money store
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-L
Yatta monsi
A-a-a-a-a-a-a it's my turn
And yeah
I'm dancing, I'm on a storm
Yatta monsi
A-a-a-a-a -a it's my turn
And yeah
I'm dancing, I'm on a storm
Yatta monsi
A-a-a-a-a -I it's my turn
I'm dancing on my soul
You have to want to see me
I-I-I-I-I-I-I can't jump
I'm dancing on my soul
