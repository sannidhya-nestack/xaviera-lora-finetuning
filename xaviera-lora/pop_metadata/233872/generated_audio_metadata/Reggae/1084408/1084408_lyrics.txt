When you get into this mood
I don't know why I can't go
Sometimes I just need to get away
Too much assurance that I'm not sure what to do about me and you
Maybe I'll wait and see
I wish I could see all I need when I'm around you
Back then before this began
Did not know I could glow, but now's before the end
Just more assurance that I'm not sure what to do about me and you
Maybe I'll wait and see
I wish I could see all I need when I'm around you
Not sure what to do about me and you
Maybe I'll wait and see
I wish I could see all I need when I'm around you
I wish I knew what to do
I'm just not sure that it's you
I wish you knew what to do
Why can't you just show me what to do now?
