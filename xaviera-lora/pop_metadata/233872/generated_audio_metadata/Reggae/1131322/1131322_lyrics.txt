Ready when me pull up, yall dem start erupt
Chaos ensues dem gone erratic, I tumble like pop from jurassic
Dem think we from yard miss, me born abroad
She want all me name, a me claim to fame
Me say ears dramatics, beard dramatics
Me a testy with multiple choice, baby listen to my voice
I wanna be the only man you want
Say okay let's stop the talk
Come make it walky walky walk
Reward me come and shoot me shot
I wanna be the only man you want
Say okay let's stop the talk
Come make it walky walky walk
Reward me come and shoot me shot
When we meet we will learn
Some of knowledge we will earn
Switch it up a fi you turn
Reconvene on the day of the tomorrow

You one want fi take away me sorrow
Let's do it so glad you run me down
Smile fi me never ever again you from
Mada mada go and mark where me switch it up
Bring this in clean come on make we stitch it up
Lick it like popsicle from the ice cream truck
What you see is what you get
