It started not so long ago when I would realize
Although my life's not perfect, it's perfect in my eyes
I got my health, I got my hands, sunshine from up above
I got my songs but most of all what I really got is love
Life is good
As it should be
Life is good, yeah it's good for me
Life is good, as it should be
Life is good, yeah it's good for me
I may not wear the latest fashions money sometimes tight
I'd rather spend that hard earned cash when I go out at night
Tonight we'll toast to friendship
Tonight we'll toast to us
And maybe in the morning we'll have more left to discuss
Life is good
As it should be
Life is good, yeah, it's good for me
Life is good
As it should be
Life is good, yeah, it's good for me
Ignorance and complaining
It won't get you nowhere
The little time we have on earth
We should all learn to care
A star to dust is how it ends
But maybe for tonight
The stars we see appear to be
The love within the light
Life is good
As it should be
Life is good, yeah it's good for me
Life is good
As it should be
Life is good, yeah it's good for me
Life is good
As it should be
Life is good, yeah, it's good for me
Life is good as it should be
Life is good, yeah, it's good for me
