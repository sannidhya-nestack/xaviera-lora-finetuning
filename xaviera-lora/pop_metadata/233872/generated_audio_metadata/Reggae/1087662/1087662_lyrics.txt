Now I know you're a leader
Can you give me a reason what you're fighting for?
My life and your life
Two different type of life
My ways and your ways
Two different type of ways
My heart and your heart
Two different type of heart and my mind and your mind
Two different type of mind
Life teach me a lesson so me change my ways
Look back inna me life and think bout my days
I try to obey and to walk the right way
But enough time me slip up and then go astray
Father God bring me back here I am today
No more cigarette but nothing me astray
True obey did not the attitude and chat God way
Me feed up on God words each and everyday because my life
And your life, two different type of life
My ways and your ways, two different type of ways
My heart and your heart, two different type of hearts
My mind and your mind, two different type of minds
My heart, my mind, my mind
The killing and the raping, well me no inna that
The war and the crime, a full time to stop that
The bigger heads them, them only full a big chat
Equal rights and justice, we nah get that
Them only full the ghetto with guns and crack
The land and the street, it dossy, dossy and hot
And every time I rise, them a pull me down back
Still poor people, nah have no food inna dem pots
My life and your life
Two different type of life, my ways and your ways
Two different type of ways, my heart and your heart
Two different type of heart, my mind and your mind
Different type of mind, my life and your life
Two different type of life, my ways and your ways
Two different type of ways
Boom ba yo, bam bam bam ba ye yo
Boom ba yo, bam bam bam ba ye yo
Boom ba yo, bam bam bam ba ye yo
BOOM BAYO! BAM BAM BAM BAYO! BOOM BAYO!
