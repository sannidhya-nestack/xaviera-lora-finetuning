Yeah you give, yeah you give me all I want for now
Yeah, you give, yeah, you give me all I want for now, ooh
You give me the sweetest feeling
Can't get you off my mind
Boy, this is the sweetest feeling
You opened up my eyes
Ooh, your touch I feel
Makes it all so real
Oh become so clear and I will hold you near
Because you give me the sweetest feeling
Can't get you off my mind, boy
This is the sweetest feeling
You opened up my eyes
Oh, yeah
You and me baby, you and I
Your love this way is all I want to feel
If only for a day, baby, won't you stay?
You give me the sweetest feeling
Can't get you off my mind
This is the sweetest feeling
You opened up my eyes
Ooh, yeah, yeah
