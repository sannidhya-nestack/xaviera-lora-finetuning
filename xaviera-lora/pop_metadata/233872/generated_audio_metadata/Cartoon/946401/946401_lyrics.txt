When the blazing sun is gone, nothing shines upon, then you, show your little light oh so bright, and the traveler in the dark, thanks you for your spark, he could, he could, he could, he could, he could, he could, he could, he could
Not seeing which way to go
I love how you shine
Shine throughout the night with you
I sing and I play throughout the night
I love how you shine
Shine throughout the night
Feels like, like I am in love
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
When the blazing sun is gone, nothing shines upon
Then you show your little light, oh so bright
And the traveler in the dark thanks you for your spark, he could
Not seeing which way to go
I love how you shine
Shine throughout the night with you
I sing and I play throughout the night
I love how you shine
Shine throughout the night
Feels like, like I am in love
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
