God save our precious Queen
Long live our noble Queen
God save the Queen
Sell her victorious, happy and glorious
Long to reign over us, God save the Queen
All the blood arise
Scatter her enemies and their blood
Confound their politics
Frustrate their knavish tricks
Haunt our hopes with fix gods' save us
Thy choices gifts in store
On her be pleased to pour
Long may she reign
May she defend our loves
And never give us cause
To sing with hearts and voice
God save the Queen
