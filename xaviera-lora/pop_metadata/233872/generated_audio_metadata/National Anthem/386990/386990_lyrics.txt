O say can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight, o'er the ramparts we watched,
Were so gallantly streaming
And the rocket's red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
