O flower of Scotland, when will we see your like again?
That fought and died for your wee bit hill and glen, and stood against him?
Proud Edward's army and sent him homeward to think again
The hills are bare now and autumn's leaves lie thick and still
O'er land that is lost now which those so dearly held that stood against them
Proud Edward's army and sent them homeward to think again
Those days are past now and in the past they must remain
But we can still rise now and be the nation again that stood against him
Proud Edward's army and sent them homeward to think again
