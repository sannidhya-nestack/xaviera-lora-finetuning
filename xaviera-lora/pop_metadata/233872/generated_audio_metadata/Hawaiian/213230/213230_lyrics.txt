Goodbye, goodbye, aloha
Adios, adieu, mi amor
Goodbye, goodbye, aloha
Adios, adieu, mi amor
Easier said than done
Yeah, it's easy to say hey
But watch him walk away hey
Try to get through one day
Goodbye, goodbye
Aloha
Adios adieu mi amor
Goodbye goodbye
Aloha
Adios adieu mi amor
No matter what he has done
To make you so mad
You're feeling so sad
You're missing the laugh
Goodbye, goodbye, aloha
Adios, adieu, mi amor
Here's how it really goes
First you wallow, wallow, wallow, wallow, wallow
In pain
Then you swallow all your pride and take the bad boy back again
Goodbye, goodbye
Aloha
Adios adieu
Mi amor
Last time
Goodbye goodbye
Aloha
Adios adieu
Mi amor
Easier said than done
