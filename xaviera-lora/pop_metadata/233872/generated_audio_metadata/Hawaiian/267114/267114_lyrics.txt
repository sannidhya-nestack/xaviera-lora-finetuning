Let's fly to a little grass hut and have Hanukkah in Hawaii
et your mother's latkes and plant your little tokus in the sand
The sun will be our candle
Our holiday festival of lights
Perhaps we'll have a miracle
We'll one tube of sunscreen last eight days and nights
We'll surf and we'll hool around
And have Hanukkah in Hawaii
Just think the Maccabees were likely swaying with the tall palm trees
We can have tradition, make a dreidel lay
Dance the hora, read the Torah while we wave to Bora Bora
So let's fly to a little grass hut and have Hanukkah in Hawaii
The sun will be our candle
Our holiday festival of lights
And it will be a miracle
If we can get together for eight days and nights
We'll leave coats and mittens at home
And have Hanukkah in Hawaii
Why do we have to freeze when we can sail in the tropical breeze?
We'll start our own tradition on Oʻahu Isle
et about our saurus and zaydee moish and moros
So let's fly to a little grass hut and have Hanukkah in Hawaiʻi
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
