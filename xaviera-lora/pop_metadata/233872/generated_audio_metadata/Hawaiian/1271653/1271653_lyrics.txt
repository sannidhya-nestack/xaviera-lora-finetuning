A risk of waters glisten under the sunny skies
Palm trees whisper secrets as the seagulls fly
Island tunes are playing a melody so sweet in this
Tropical paradise where hearts and oceans meet
Aloha, let's dance in the sand by the sea, Aloha
Feel the rhythm, let your spirit be free
Under the moonlight, just you and me
In this Hawaiian dream
Where we belong, mad in dream
Where we belong naturally
Sunsets paint the horizon in shades of red and blue
Every moment's magic when I'm here with you
We'll chase the waves together with laughter in the air
In this serene haven without a single care
Aloha, let's dance in the sand by the sea
Aloha, feel the rhythm let your spirit be free
Under the moonlight, just you and me
In this Hawaiian dream
Where we belong, not in dream
Where we belong naturally
Stars above are shining, lighting up the night
We'll hold each other close until the morning light
With the island song guided us through
Every day is paradise when I'm with you
Aloha, let's dance in the sand by the sea
Aloha, feel the rhythm, let your spirit be free
Another moonlight, just you and me in this Hawaiian dream
Where we belong, not in dream, where we belong naturally
Where we belong naturally
Stars above are shining, lighting up the night
We'll hold each other close until the morning light
With the island song guiding us through
Every day is paradise when I'm with you
Aloha, let's dance in the sand by the sea
Aloha, feel the rhythm let your spirit be free
Under the moonlight, just you and me
In this Hawaiian dream
Where we belong now in dream
Where we belong naturally
Where we belong now in dream
Where we belong naturally
