Woke up to the sound of the oceans roar
Grabbed my board and headed for the shore
Salt in the air, sand on my feet
Island rhythm sets my soul asleep
Ooh, a heartbeat, tropical groove
Paradise found in every move
Swaying palms in crystal seas
Living easy, wild and free
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Coconut shade and a cool drink
Watching surfers ride the brink
Ukulele strums a sweet melody
This is where I'm meant to be
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Hula heartbeat, tropical groove
Paradise found in every move
Swaying palm and crystal seas
Living easy, wild and free
Cooping a shade and a cool drink
Watching surfers ride the brink
Ukulele strums a sweet melody
This is where I'm meant to be
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Be around my neck, flower in my hair
Good vibes everywhere
Island magic in the air tonight
Everything's gonna be alright
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Pool of heartbeat, tropical brew
Paradise found in every moon
Swaying palms in crystal seas
Living easy and wild and free
A low-hot spirit never gonna leave
Gosh that I'm in love on my sleep
Pool of heartbeat forever strong
In my heart where I belong
