Waves whispered as hills of old
And you're on the field of gold
Sunset views on a tranquil shore
In this moment I adore
Maui's breeze and ocean song
With you I feel alone
Echoes of the isles where our spirits dance
And the twilight's warm its spell
From ancient lands to the oceans too
Our love shines like the moon
Hidden codes and fragrant blooms
We're lost in paradise rooms
The rhythm of the island heart
In this place we'll never part
Stars align in the evening sky
In your gaze I find my why
With every wave and every sigh
We're bound by the island's tide
Echoes of the islands where our spirits dance
And the twilight's warm expanse
Ancient letters to the oceans tune
Our love shines like the moon
Echoes of the islands where our spirits dance
In the twilight's warm expanse
From ancient letters to the oceans tune
Our love shines like the moon
Hidden coves and furby ocean breeze
Our love's written in the seas
Reach new dawn, we'll explore
In this paradise forevermore
Echoes of the islands where our spirits dance
In twilight's warm expanse
From ancient planets to the ocean's tomb
Our love shines like the moon
In the whispers of the ocean breeze
Our love's written in the sea
With each new dawn
We'll explore in this paradise forevermore
Echoes of the isles where our spirits dance
In the twilight's warm expanse
Ancient letters to the ocean's tomb
Our love shines like the moon
