Drifting in a hammock, beneath the bamboo trees
The sound of waves is soothing, carried by the breeze
Sipping on a coconut
Feeling the island's vibe
In this coastal harmony
Where our souls align
Coastal harmony where the ocean sings
Every moment here and this joy it brings
With each crashing wave and each sunrise glow
Our love grows deeper in this ebb and flow
Kayaking through the mangroves
Exploring hidden ways
Watching dolphins play in the golden rays
Building castles in the sand
Laughing in the sun
From this island wonderland
Two hearts become one
Coastal harmony where the ocean sings
Every moment here and this joy it brings
With these crashing waves and each sunrise glow
Our love grows deeper in this ebb and flow
As the evening falls and the sky turns red
We'll light a lantern with words unsaid
Floating on the water our wishes take flight
In this coastal heaven everything feels right
Coastal harmony where the ocean sings
Every moment here and this joy it brings
With each crashing wave and each sunrise glow
Our love grows deeper in this heaven flow
Coastal harmony where the ocean sings
Every moment here and this joy it brings
With each crashing wave and each sunrise glow
Our love grows deeper in the seven floors
There grows no harmony
Where the ocean sings
There grows no harmony
Where the ocean sings
