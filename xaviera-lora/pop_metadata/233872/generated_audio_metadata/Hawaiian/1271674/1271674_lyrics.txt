Golden sand beneath our toes
As the waves roll in
The scent of plumeria
Where our story begins
Coconut palms swaying
To a gentle island tune
In this tropical paradise
Under the glowing moon
Tropical paradise where our hearts align
In this land of wonders everything is fine
With each ocean whisper and each sunset's hue
We find love forever in skies so blue
Snorkeling in the coral reefs where colors come alive
With you by my side
I feel so revived
It's glory in hidden codes
And cliffs so high
In this paradise our spirits fly
Tropical paradise, where our hearts align
In this land of wonders, everything is fine
With each ocean whisper, and each sunset's hue
We'd find our forever in skies so blue
Snorkeling in the coral reefs where colors come alive
With you by my side, I feel so revived
Exploring hidden codes, and cliffs so high
In this paradise our spirits fly
Tropical paradise, where our hearts align
In this land of wonders, everything is fine
With each ocean whisper, and each sunset, he once said
We'd find love forever in skies so blue
Bonfires on the beach as the stars appear
In the warmth of your embrace I have no fear
Island drums are beating, a rhythm so divine
In this tropical paradise you are mine
Tropical paradise where our hearts align
In this land of wonders everything is fine
With each ocean whistler and each sunset's hue
We find our forever in skies so blue
