More luck I'm owning, the sun starts to rise
Gentle breezes and clear blue skies
Calla a pop-up cliff standing tall
In this hidden gem I found it all
Feel the island's ancient call
In your arms I have it all
Molokai magic where our hearts align
In this tranquil place love's desire
Through the valleys and the sea so blue
Molokai I'm home with you
Halawa's waters cool and clear
Whispering secrets we hold dear
Coconut grows, sway in time
Every moment with you, alright
Feel the island's ancient call
In your arms, I have it all
Mocha magic where our hearts align
In this tranquil place, love's design
Through the valleys and the sea so blue
Mullica I'm home with you
Lanterns light the evening glow
In your eyes the love I know
With every star that lights the sky
Our love grows, we're flying high
Molokai magic where our hearts align
In this tranquil place, love's design
Through the valleys and the sea so blue
Molokai I'm home with you
Lanterns light the evening glow
In your eyes, the love I know
With every star that lights the sky
Our love grows, we're flying high
Molokai magic where our hearts align
In this tranquil place, love's design
Through the valleys and the sea so blue
Molokai I'm home with you
