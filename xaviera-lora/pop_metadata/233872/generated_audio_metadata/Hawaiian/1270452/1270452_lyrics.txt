Underneath the high low rain
In your eyes I feel no pain
Tropical blooms in the hues
In this reverie I've choosed you
Island reverie where our spirits soar
In the embrace of the oceans roar
From the cliffs to the endless sea
Our love's a perfect melody
All our cries quiet tranquil days
In your smile I find my ways
Secret paths and hidden trails
In you our love prevails
Stars align above our heads
In this paradise our love is fate
With every wave and gentle breeze
In your arms I find my ease
Autumn reverie where our spirits soar in the embrace of the ocean's roar
From the cliffs to the endless sea our love's a perfect melody
Mullet kites quiet tranquil days in your smile I find my ways
Secret paths and hidden trails with you our love prevails
Love's a line above our heads
In this paradise all our love is fed
With every wave and gentle breeze
In your arms I find my ease
Island reverie where our dreams are spun
In the warmth of the setting sun
From the valleys to the south our skies
In your love I realize
Island reverie, where our spirits soar in the embrace of the oceans of old
From the cliffs to the endless sea, our love's a perfect melody
Blue eyes whisper through the trees, in your touch my heart's at ease
Every dawn and every night, in your love our worlds align
