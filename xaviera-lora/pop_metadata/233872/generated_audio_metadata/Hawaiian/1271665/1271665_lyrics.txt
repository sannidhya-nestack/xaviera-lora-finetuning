Morning light on crystal waves brings the day anew
Shells and sand beneath our feet, a world of vibrant hue
We wander through the shoreline where the ocean meets the sky
In this island paradise we let our spirits fly
Ocean breeze set our hearts free
In this island dream just you and me
With every wave and every palm tree
We find our love where the sea meets the breeze
Canoes cut through the azure
Fish start in the deep
Tales of ancient mariners
In our hearts we keep
Lanterns light the evening
As the sun dips low
In this island beauty
Our love continues to grow
Ocean breeze set our hearts free
In this island dream just you and me
With every wave and every palm tree
We find our love where the sea meets the breeze
Canoes cut through the azure, fish start in the deep
Tales of ancient mariners, in our hearts we keep
Lanterns light the evening, as the sun dips low
In this island beauty, our love continues to grow
Ocean breeze, set our hearts free
In this island dream, just you and me
With every wave and every palm tree
We find our love where the sea meets the breeze
Under the waterfall's mist we find a hidden cove
Nature's symphony surrounds us as we explore this trove
With each passing moment we cherish every scene
Living in this wonderland like it's a perfect dream
Ocean breeze set our hearts free
In this island dream just you and me
With every wave and every palm tree
We find our love where the sea beats the breeze
Where the sea beats the breeze
