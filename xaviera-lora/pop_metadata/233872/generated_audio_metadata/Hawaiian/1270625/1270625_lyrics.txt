Soft sand between my toes
Warm breeze how it blows
Diamond head in the distance
Paradise is persistence why kinky dreams?
Nothing's what it seems
Turquoise waves and golden beams
Low high life or so it seems
Surfboards lined up on the shore
Hula dancers tell all and lore
Ukulele's gentle, strong
To this rhythm we succumb, wakiki dreams
Nothing's what it seems
Turquoise waves and golden beams
Aloha life, oh so it seems
Tiki torches light the night
Stars above shine so bright
Mountain tides and island beats
Life here can't be beat
Waikiki dreams
Nothing's what it seems
Turquoise waves and golden beats
Aloha life, or so it seems
As the sun dips in the sea
I know where I'm meant to be
In the slice of paradise
Waikiki you will suffice
