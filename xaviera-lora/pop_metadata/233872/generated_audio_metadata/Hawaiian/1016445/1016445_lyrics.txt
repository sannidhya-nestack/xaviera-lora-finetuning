We will see, we will see, we will see
We will see, we will see, we will see
We will follow, we will follow the light
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo
When the sea, when the sea is cold, when the sea
When the sea, when the sea is cold, when the sea
When the sun is not shining
When I'm feeling alone
When I'm feeling alone
When I'm feeling alone
When I'm feeling alone
When I'm feeling alone
When I'm feeling alone
When I'm feeling alone
