Underneath the lazy palms where the waves kiss the shore
Life is moving slowly, couldn't ask for more
Suns that paints the sky in hues of pink and gold
In this island paradise, stories unfold
Aloha, take it easy, let your worries fade away
Aloha, feel the breeze in this perfect day
We're relaxing in the sunlight, chilling all day
Feel the heart of Hawaii come what may
Cool drinks and laughter with friends by our side
Island rhythms play as we take the tide
Every moment's treasure in this peaceful place
With the ocean song, time slows its pace
Aloha, take it easy, let your worries fade away
Aloha, feel the breeze in this perfect day
We're relaxing in the sunlight, chilling all day
Feel the heart of Hawaii come with me
Cool drinks and laughter with friends by our side
Island rhythms play as we take the tide
Every moment's treasure in this peaceful place
With the ocean song time slows its pace
Aloha, take it easy let your worries fade away
Aloha, feel the breeze in this perfect day
We're relaxing the sunlight, chilling all day
In the heart of Hawaii, come what may
Stars begin to twinkle as the night comes near
We'll lay on the sand with nothing to fear
Island dreams will find us under the moon's light
In this haven of peace everything's right
Aloha
Take it easy let your worries fade away
Aloha, feel the breeze in this perfect bay
We'll relax in the sunlight, chillin' all day
In the heart of Hawaii, come what may
