Hollow rain falls soft and sweet
Dancing droplets at our feet
Orchid petals kiss the ground
In this lush paradise love is found
In the hollow rain we find our song
Nature's rhythm where we belong
Hand in hand through misty lakes
Our love grows strong in the high low rain
Where the cool river rushes wild and free
Telling tales of you and me
Rainbow falls in a shimmering mist
Moments with you, pure bliss
In the high low rain we find our song
Nature's rhythm where we belong
Hand in hand through misty lanes
Our love grows strong
In the high low rain
Heaven's fire in the distance glows
Through the ferns where the forest grows
In the heart of high low spirits, oh
With you I'm home forevermore
In the high low rain we find our song
Nature's rhythm where we belong
Hand in hand through misty lanes
Our love grows strong in the high low rain
Hell is fire and the distance glows
Through the ferns where the forest grows
In the heart of high low spirits soar
With you I'm home forevermore
In the high low rain we find our song
Nature's rhythm where we belong
Hand in hand through misty lakes
Our love grows strong in the high low range
