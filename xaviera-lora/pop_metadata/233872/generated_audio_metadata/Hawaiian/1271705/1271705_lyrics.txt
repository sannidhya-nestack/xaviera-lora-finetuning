Sunrise on the horizon, colors fill the sky
Birds sing the melody as we wander by
In the heart of the island where nature runs free
We find our connection, just you and me
Island wonders, oh oh oh
We discover love forevermore
Exploring hidden trails through lush green trees
Waterfalls cascading down to meet the seas
Every step an adventure every moment bright
In this island paradise we find pure delight
Island wonders oh oh oh
We discover love forevermore
Its story hidden trails through lush green trees
Waterfalls cascading down to meet the seas
Every step an adventure every moment bright
In this island paradise we find pure delight
Island wonders oh oh oh
We discover a forevermore
Sunsets paint the sky in hues of gold and red
As we lay beneath the stars our hearts are net
The rhythm of the island beats within our chest
In this sacred place we find our rest
Island wonders (Island wonders)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We discover love's love forevermore (forevermore)
Exploring hidden trails through lush green trees (oh lush green trees)
Waterfalls cascading down to meet the sea (to meet the sea)
Every step of adventure, every moment bright
In this island paradise, you find pure delight
Island wonder (Island wonder)
Oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh)
We discover (We discover)
Forevermore (Forevermore)
