Gentle waves are calling
In the soft evening glow
Time moves a little slower
Where the trade winds blow
Barefoot on the shoreline
Feeling free and light
In this island rhythm
Everything's just right
Aloha, breathe in deep, let the moment last
Aloha, close your eyes, let the stress pass
We'll drift with the tide, under the sky so vast
And slay vast paradise where peace is cast
Coconut and mango
Sweet upon our lips
Sway into the music
With a gentle twist
Every laugh, every smile
Brighter than the sun
In this mellow heaven
Life is simply fun
Aloha, breathe in deep, let the moment last
Aloha, close your eyes, let the stress pass
We'll drift with the tide under the sky so vast
Enslavement paradise where peace is cast
Coconut and mango
Sweet upon our lips
Swaying to the music
With a gentle twist
Every laugh, every smile
Brighter than the sun
In this little haven
Life is simply fun
As the stars come out, we'll sing a lullaby
Underneath the moon in the clear night sky
With sound of the waves in your head and mine
We'll cherish these moments, time after time, ooh
Aloha, breathe in deep, let the moment last, moment last
Aloha, close your eyes, let the stress pass (stress pass)
The stress pass
We'll drift with the tide under the sky so fast
Enslavement paradise
Where peace is cast
Where peace is cast
