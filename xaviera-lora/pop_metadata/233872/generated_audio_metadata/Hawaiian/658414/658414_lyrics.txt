She's my hula-hati Honolulu baby
From Hawaii in the South Pacific Sea
My hula-hati Honolulu baby
Means the whole world to me
My hula-hati Honolulu baby
Loves me all the while
My hula-hati Honolulu baby
Got such a beautiful smile
Watch her sway as I play on my steel guitar
Beneath the moon she sings a tune from a distant shore
See her hips and her tender lips
That Honolulu honey of mine
She's my hula hearty Honolulu baby
From Hawaii in the South Pacific Sea
Yes my hula hearty Honolulu baby
Means the whole world to me
My hula hearty Honolulu baby
Loves me all the while
My hula hearty Honolulu baby
Got such a beautiful smile
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
She's my hula-hati Honolulu baby
From Hawaii in the South Pacific Sea
My hula-hati Honolulu baby
Means the whole world to me
My hula-hati Honolulu baby
Loves me all the while
My hula-hati Honolulu baby
Got such a beautiful smile
Watch her sway as I play my steel guitar
Beneath the moon she sings her tune from a distant shore
See her hips and her tender lips
That Honolulu honey of mine
She's my hula-hati Honolulu baby
From Hawaii in the South Pacific Sea
Yes my hula-hati Honolulu baby
Means the whole world to me
My hula-hati Honolulu baby
Loves me all the while
My hula-hati Honolulu baby
Got such a beautiful smile
My hula-hati Honolulu baby
Got such a beautiful smile
My yummy yummy yummy yummy honey
Got such a beautiful smile
