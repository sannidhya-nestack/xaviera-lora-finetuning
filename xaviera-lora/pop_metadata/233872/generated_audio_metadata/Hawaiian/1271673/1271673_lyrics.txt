Morning new on firmly, sun begins to rise
Birds sing a melody under clear blue skies
Walking through the rainforest where the waterfalls flow
In this island sanctuary love continues to grow
Island echoes calling out our names
In this tranquil paradise nothing feels the same
With each wave that crashes and each breeze that blows
Our hearts beat together where the island echoes
Break mix on the green cliffs overlooking the sea
Dancing in the twilight, feeling wild and free
Every star a story, every night a song
In this island dreamscape where we both belong
Island echoes, calling out our names
In this tranquil paradise, nothing feels the same
With each wave that crashes and each breeze that blows
Our hearts beat together when the island echoes
Tiki lights are glowing, casting shadows bright
We'll stay up until dawn beneath the soft moonlight
Whispered words of promise carried by the tide
In this island dreamscape where we both belong
Island echoes calling out our names
In this tranquil paradise nothing feels the same
With each wave that crashes and each breeze that blows
Our hearts beat together where the island echoes
Tiki lights are glowing, casting shadows bright
We'll stay up until dawn, beneath the soft moonlight
Whispered words of promise, carried by the tide
In this island refuge with you by my side
Island echoes, the scrolling on, all in our heartlands, all in our heartlands
Electric with paradise, nothing feels the same, nothing feels the same
With each wave that crashes, and each breeze that blows
Our hearts beat together, where the island echoes
