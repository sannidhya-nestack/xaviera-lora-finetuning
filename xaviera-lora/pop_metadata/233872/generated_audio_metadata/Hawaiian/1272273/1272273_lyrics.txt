Morning's by the shoreline, waves kiss the sand
Walking with you slowly, hand in hand
The scent of hibiscus floating in the air
In this palm tree paradise, love is everywhere
Palm tree paradise where dreams come true
Just me and you beneath skies so blue
Gentle breezes whispering our name
In this island wonder love will never change
Afternoons of sunshine, picnics on the grass
Laughter echoes softly as the hours pass
Exploring hidden trails beneath the emerald leaves
In this palm tree paradise our hearts believe
Palm tree paradise where dreams come true
Just me and you beneath sky so blue
Gentle breezes whispering our name
In this island wonder love will never change
Evenings by the bonfire, stories in the night
Stars above us twinkling, everything feels right
With you by my side, under the palm tree shade
In this island paradise, memories we've made
Palm tree paradise where dreams come true
Just me and you beneath the sky so blue
Gentle breezes whispering our name
In this island wonder love will never change
