I got a feeling but I don't know why
It popped right up from my left hand side
Made me think about another time
When we were up and we felt alive with you and me
We just gotta hope there's more to see
And I know we got bills to pay
And I know we got stuff to say
Deep down we're just the same
Rolling on to play this game
But why, oh why
Why can't we just smile today
But let's just smile today, eh-eh, eh-eh, yeah
I can see but I must be blind
what we had is getting hard to find
I try to find another way to say
We gotta make this change today, it's you and me
I really hope there's more to see
And I know we got bills to pay
And I know we got stuff to say
Deep down we're just the same
Rolling on to play this game
But why, oh why
Why can't we just smile today
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's just smile today
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's just smile today
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby let's just smile today
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Come on baby let's just smile today
