Golden sun is sinking, painting skies with fire
Echoes of the island fill our hearts desire
Palm trees gently swaying to a tropical tune
As we find our rhythm
Beneath the rising moon
In the sunset's glow
We'll dance the night away
Lost in each other
In this silent bay
With every gentle wave
Our love will serenade
In this perfect moment
Memories are made
The scent of frangipani mingles with the breeze
Whispering sweet secrets through the sweating trees
Together we'll explore this paradise so grand
Hand in hand forever on this sacred land
In the sunset's glow we'll dance the night away
Lost in each other in this silent bay
With every gentle wave our love will serenade
In this perfect moment memories are made
As the stars shine brighter in the midnight sky
We'll cherish every second as the night goes by
In the warmth of your embrace I'll find my home
In the silent magic we'll never be alone
In the sunset's glow, we'll dance the night away
Lost in each other, in this silent bay
With every gentle wave, our love will serenade
In this perfect moment, memories are made
As the stars shine brighter in the midnight sky
We'll cherish every second as the night goes by
In the warmth of your embrace I'll find my home
In this silent magic we'll never be alone
In the sunset's glow, we'll dance the night away
Lost in each other, in this silent bay
With every gentle wave, our love will serenade
In this perfect moment, memories are made
