Golden sun sets on the horizon line
Holding your hand, knowing your mind
Whispered secrets in the evening breeze
Love flowing easy like the rolling seas
Lighting waves of love so high
Underneath the Hawaiian sky
Every kiss is sweet embrace
Finding heaven in this place
Shells and treasures wash the shore
Moments with you I cherish more
Soft guitar plays a melody
Lost in your eyes I feel so free
Riding waves of love so high
Underneath the Hawaiian sky
Every kiss a sweet embrace
Finding heaven in this place
Shells and treasures wash the shore
Moments with you I cherish more
Soft guitar plays a melody
Lost in your eyes I feel so free
Stars align, guiding our way
In your arms, I wanna stay
Island nights and dreams so true
All my heart belongs to you
Riding waves of love so high
Underneath the Hawaiian sky
Every kiss is sweet embrace
Fighting heaven in this place
Riding waves of love so high
Underneath the Hawaiian sky
Every kiss a sweet embrace
Finding heaven in this place
