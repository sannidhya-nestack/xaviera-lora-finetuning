Mowing, molding coffee in our hands
Watching surfers carve across the sands
Lechainah whispers tales of old
Where love stories are still told
Under a Maui sky's where our hearts collide
Every wave brings you closer by my side
From all of the coloss heights to the oceans blue
My Maui love my dream come true
Rainbow bridges after summer rain
Driving on this road, wild and untamed
Waterfalls that sing a timeless tune
Together we'll find our own
Under a Maui sky's where our hearts collide
Every wave brings you closer by my side
From Hualala Kailash Heights to the ocean's blue
My Maui love, my dream come true
Starlit nights on Kaanapali shore
Will whales songs echo we listen for more
Are we magic in your touch
In this island's charm we have so much
Under a mile we've skies where our hearts collide
Every wave brings you closer by my side
From Hualala, Kailash Heights to the oceans blue
My mile we love, my dream come true
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Starlit nights on Kanapali shore
