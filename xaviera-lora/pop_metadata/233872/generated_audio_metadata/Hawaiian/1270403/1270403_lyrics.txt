Waikiki sun's beneath our feet
In your eyes, a love so sweet
Diamond head in the morning glow
With you my heart will always know
Whispers of Waikiki where our love's alive
In the city's rhythm of life
From the surf to the stormy night
In this paradise our hearts ignite
Palm trees sway to the island song
In your arms where I belong
Evenings by the ocean's kiss
Every moment feels like bliss
Stars above and waves below in Waikiki
Our love will grow with every sunset and every tide
You're the love I cannot hide
Whispers of Waikiki where dreams are swung
Underneath the setting sun
From the shoreline to the city's light
In your love everything's right
Whispers of Waikiki where our love's alive
And we thrive from this earth to the sunny night
In this paradise our hearts ignite
Palm trees sway to the island song
In your arms where I belong
Evenings by the ocean's kiss
Every moment feels like bliss
Stars above and waves below in Waikiki
Our love will grow with every sunset and every tide
You're the love I cannot hide
Whispers of Waikiki where dreams are spun
Underneath the setting sun
From the shoreline to the city's light
In your love everything's right
As the night falls on the sea
And wacky keys embrace what's serene
With every whisper of the sea
Forever it's you and me
