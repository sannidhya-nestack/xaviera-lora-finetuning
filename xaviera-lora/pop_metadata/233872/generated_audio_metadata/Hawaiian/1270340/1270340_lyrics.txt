Sunset glowed in Maui's calm
Together here we have it all
Walking through Lahaina streets
Where history and romance meet
Haleakala summit high
With you I touch the sky
Magic of a bow in your eyes
Underneath these endless skies
From Hans Vood to Karl
Parties short every day I love you more
Stars twinkle above us two
In this island's magic I found you
Palm trees sway and I feel the beat
Of our hearts in Maui's heat
Magic of Maui holding tight
With you everything's so right
Where our songs echo dolphins play
In your arms I'll always stay
Pineapple fields sweet and bright
Kapalu trails in morning light
Kanapali's waves so blue
Every moment just us two
Magic of Maui in your eyes
Underneath these endless skies
From Hala's road to Kanapali shore
Every day I love you more
Magic of how we hold them tight
With you everything's so right
Where our songs echo dolphins play
In your arms I'll always stay
Pineapple fields sweet and bright
Kapalua trails in morning light
Kaanapali's waves so blue
Every moment just us two
Magic of Maui in your eyes
Underneath these endless skies
From Huns Road to Kala Pali
Sure every day I love you more
Magic of Maui
Holding tight with you everything's so right
Where songs echo, dolphins play
In your arms I'll always stay
