Cloud night mornings where the orchids bloom
In your eyes I find my room
Quiet beaches, golden sands
Walking together hand in hand
Ride my love under the sun
Our hearts beating as one
In this peaceful isle we belong
Singing our love night love song
Shipwreck beach where the waves crash high
Underneath the clear blue sky
Garden of Gods, mystical and grand
Every step with you, perfectly planned
Loud night love, under the sun
Our hearts beating as one
In this peaceful isle we belong
Singing our loud night love song
Suns that paints the sky with hue so bright
Stars emerge, guiding us through the night
In this island's embrace our love soars
Lanai whispers, forever yours
Lanai love, under the sun
Our hearts beating as one
In this peaceful isle we belong
Singing our line, our love song
As the moonlight kisses the sea
Promise you'll stay here with me
In Lanai's heaven where dreams are spun
Our love story has just begun
Lanai love, under the sun
Our hearts beating as one
In this peaceful isle we belong
Singing our love night love song
