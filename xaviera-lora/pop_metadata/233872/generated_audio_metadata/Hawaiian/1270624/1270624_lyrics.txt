Sunlight creeping through the blinds
Coffee brewing taking our time
Newspapers sprawled across the bed
Thoughts of a Monday not in sky
It's a lazy Sunday
No need to run away
Just you and me and nowhere to be
Let's make this feeling stay
Old records spinning on the shelf
Pancakes cooking by themselves
Bare feet on the hardwood floor
This is what weekends are for
It's a lazy Sunday
No need to run away
Just you and me and no work, babe
Let's make this feeling stay
Maybe later we'll take a stroll
On things that show us control
So water and stay in our sweats
No alarms, no reggae's at four
It's a lazy Sunday
No need to run away
Just you and me and nowhere to be, let's let this feeling stay
Maybe later we'll take a stroll, or things that show, lose control
Order and stay in our sweats, no alarms, no regrets
It's a lazy Sunday, no need to run away
Just you and me in nowhere, dear
Let's make this feeling stay
As the sun sets, we're still here
Wrapped in blankets, holding near
Monday's coming but that's okay
We'll always have our lazy Sunday
