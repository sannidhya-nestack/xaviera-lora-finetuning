Hoppers of the OE, calling out our names
Suns gone and rays hitting hard to land
Waves are gently crashing, till we're soothing deep
In this island hanging, where our hearts can meet
Feel the island's magic in the air so sweet
With every step we take beneath the sandy heat
Together we'll discover what true love's about
In this paradise found there's no doubt
Coconut and pineapple, taste of summer days
Barefoot on the beaches where the children play
The scent of hibiscus in the evening breeze
Here in this paradise we live with thee
Feel the atmosphere's magic and the air so sweet
With every step we take beneath the sandy heat
Together we'll discover what true love's about
In this paradise found there's no doubt
Coconut and pineapple, taste of summer days
Barefoot on the beaches where the children play
The scent of hibiscus in the evening breeze
Here in this paradise we live with ease
Coconut and pineapple, taste of summer days
Barefoot on the beaches where the children play
The scent of her discover
When the evening breathes
Here in this paradise found
There's no doubt
Feel the island's magic
In the air so sweet
With every step we take
Beneath the sandy heat
Together we'll discover
What true love's about
In this paradise found
There's no doubt
And there's no doubt
Underneath the starlit sky we'll make our vows
In the quiet of the night only here and now
With the island as our witness we'll promise to stay
In love forever more day by day
As the tides keep turning and the years go by
We'll hold on to this love, reaching for the sky
In our hearts this island forever will be
Our paradise found for eternity
