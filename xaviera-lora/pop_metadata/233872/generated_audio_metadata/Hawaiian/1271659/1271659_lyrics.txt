Underneath the azure skies where the mountains greet the sea
Every moment feels like magic in this island fantasy
Ticky torches flicker as the night begins to fall
In the warmth of the tropics I hear your call
In the ocean's melody you will find our song
Where the waves and the wind
Carry us along with each heartbeat in this island's embrace
We'll create our love in this enchanting place
Rainbow colored fishes dance beneath the waves
Coral reefs are glowing in these hidden caves
Hand in hand we wander through this paradise
Every moment with you feels like paradise
In the ocean's melody you will find our song
We're the waves and the wind
Along with each heartbeat in this island's embrace
We'll create our love in this enchanting place
As the night birds sing and the stars align
We'll share our dreams as our souls entwine
In the glow of the moonlight our spirits will soar
In this Hawaiian heaven forevermore
In the ocean's melody you'll find our song
Where the waves and the wind
Carry us along with each heartbeat in this island's embrace
We'll create our love in this enchanting place
Rainbow colored fishes dance beneath the waves
Coral reefs are glowing in these hidden caves
Hand in hand we wander through this paradise
Every moment with you feels like paradise
In the ocean's melody you will find our song
Where the waves and the wind carry us along
With each heartbeat in this island's embrace
We'll create our love in this enchanting way
As the night birds sing and the stars align
We'll share our dreams as our souls entwine
In the glow of the moonlight our spirits will soar
In this Hawaiian heaven forever more
In the ocean's melody you'll find our song
Where the waves and the wind
Carry us along with each heartbeat in this island's embrace
We'll create our love in this enchanting place
