Day by day you feel the pulse of the world beat on
The moment's here then the moment's gone
And we move on our way
The days race on
And the pace is so merciless
And the road becomes meaningless
Dawn to dusk, dusk to dawn
But in Hanalei (Hanalei)
Magic breezes come off the bay (off the bay)
And they warm and caress the soul (caress the soul)
Harmonic elements blend
In Hanalei (Hanalei)
You feel the balance in nature's rhyme (nature's rhyme)
Enchanting rhythm of space and time (space and time)
Plays on without end
Plays on without end
A magic land, holy mixture of sand and sea
Waves they worship eternally
And come to rest on the sand
Children play
Surfers search for the turquoise gem
The perfect ride that saluted them
Always one day away
But in Hanalei (Hanalei)
Magic breezes come off the bay (off the bay)
And they warm and caress the soul (caress the soul)
Harmonic elements blend
In Hanalei (Hanalei)
You feel the balance in nature's rhyme (nature's rhyme)
Enchanting rhythm of space and time (space and time)
Plays on without end
Plays on without end
