Awake to morning whispers
Where the palm still is swaying
The scent of blooming jasmine
Welcomes the new day
Footsteps on a shoreline
Leaving trails in the sand
In this island dreamscape
Life is simply grand
Ocean dreams
Where our hearts collide
In this island magic
Love is our guide
With every crashing wave
And the sun's warm gleam
We find our forever
In these ocean dreams
Paddle boards and laughter floating on the sea
Exploring hidden hopes where we can just be
The colours of the sunset
Paint the evening sky
In this island heaven
Time gently passes by
Ocean dreams where our hearts collide
In this island magic
Love is our guide
With every crashing wave
And the sun's warm gleam
We find our forever in these ocean dreams
Lanterns light the twilight casting shadows long
We dance under the stars to the ocean song
Whispers of the sea tell tales of ancient lore
In this timeless moment
We love more and more
Ocean dreams
Where our hearts collide
In this island magic
Love is our guide
With every crashing wave
And the sun's warm gleam
We find our forever
In these ocean dreams
Lanterns of light, twilight, cast in shadows long
We dance under the stars, to the ocean's song
Whispers of the sea, tell tales of ancient lore
In this timeless moment
We love more and more
Of ocean dreams
Where our hearts collide
In this island magic
Love is our guide
With every crashing wave
And the sun's melancholy
We'll find our forever
In these ocean dreams
