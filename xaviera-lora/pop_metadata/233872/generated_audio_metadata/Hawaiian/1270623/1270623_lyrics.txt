Sun-kissed mornings, golden light
Pineapple fields, such a sight
Ukulele playing soft and low
Island time, nice and slow
Under pineapple skies
Paradise before my eyes
A Roa spirit never dies
Living life Hawaiian style
Surfing waves at Waikiki
Kua dancers, a move so free
Luau nights under the stars
Slack key guitar near and far
Thunder pineapple skies
Paradise before my eyes
Aroha spirit never dies
Living life Hawaiian style
Volcanic mountains touch the clouds
Rainbows arch and nature prowl
Gentle rain on taro leaves
Trade winds whisper through the trees
Under pineapple skies
Paradise before my eyes
A low-ice near it never dies
Living life Hawaiian style
Mahalo for this perfect day
Island magic here to stay
Pineapple sky is always blue
Aloha means I love you
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do
