Come the coast where the lava meets the sea
You and I, wild and free
Sipping coffee from the island's heart
And this paradise will never part
Feel the rhythm of the island drum
Hear the whispers of where we're from
Colder nights where the stars shine bright
Dancing shadows in the firelight
Under the palms of my light
In your arms everything's right
Volcanoes towering ancient and old
Stories of telling the legends told
We walk the black sand hand in hand
Every moment with you is grand
Feel the rhythm of the island drum
Hear the whispers of where we're from
Colder nights where the stars shine bright
Dancing shadows in the firelight
Under the palms you're my delight
In your arms everything's right
Volcanoes towering, ancient and bold
Stories of Pele and the legends told
We walk the black sand hand in hand
Every moment with you is grand
Feel the rhythm of the island drum
Hear the whispers of where we're from
Colder nights where the stars shine bright
Dancing shadows in the firelight
Under the palms you're my delight
In your arms everything's right
Lanterns glowing in the soft twilight
Echoes of Aloha fill the night
With every wave our hearts align
Kona love forever mine
Lanterns glowing in the soft twilight
Echoes of Aloha fill the night
With every wave our hearts align
Kona love forever mine
As the moon dips into the sea
Promise me you'll always be
Here in Kona where dreams take flight
Loving you my endless night
