Underneath the banyan trees where whispers meet the shore
Life's a gentle rhythm here on this isle's core
Paddling through the turquoise waves with the morning light
Every day's an adventure in this tropical delight
In the heart of Hawaii where dreams come true
We find our joy in the ocean blue
With the tides of bliss and the sun's warm kiss
Island life is pure happiness
Driftwood fires burning as the sun dips low
Laughter and aloha in the fire lights glow
Tales of ancient legends shared under the stars
In this silent paradise love is never far
In the heart of Hawaii where dreams come true
We find our joy in the ocean
But with the tides of bliss and the sun's warm kiss
Island life is pure happiness
Driftwood fires burning as the sun dips low
Laughter and Aloha in the fire lights glow
Tales of ancient legends shared under the stars
In this silent paradise love is never far
In the heart of Hawaii where dreams come true
We find our joy in the ocean blue
With the tides of bliss and the sun's warm kiss
Island life is pure happiness
Morning hikes through valleys where waterfalls cascade
Nature's song is endless in every glen and glade
With each step together we find peace and grace
In this land of beauty, in this sacred place
In the heart of Hawaii where dreams come true
We find our joy in the ocean blue
With the tides of bliss and the sun's warm kiss
Our life is pure happiness
All in life is pure happiness
