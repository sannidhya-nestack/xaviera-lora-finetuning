Feel a warm breeze on your face
Let the rhythm take its place
Hearts will dance under the moon
Bossa Nova humming tunes
In a cafe by the bay in the mornings
Love those words full of sway whispered in for you
Fingers strong, smooth melody, moving harmonies
Day turns to a softer ray, dreams of how I feel
Stars above begin to shine, glitz of truth
As we sip our red wine, time to lose our shoes
Rhythms wrap around our mind, hearts aligned with you
Everything feels so divine
Love is playful news
Sway with me by the sea
All the night in blue
Catch the moon silver spree
Dancing in a hue
Whisper secrets to the breeze
Soft and soft skin
In our hearts eternity
We begin again
High upon the rooftops, low ceiling separates
Night reveals what we don't know, for the time we chase
Echoes call from long ago, songs of endless space
In this moment let it show, beauty we can't find
Waves will tell our precious tales in our soul
Love that breeze and never flail leaves us feel whole
Smiling through the night sail to the sea we stroll
Hearts that soar without rails losing all control
Brothers play for minutes
Brothers play for minutes
Brothers play for minutes
