Feel the breeze, listen close
Under skies where love grows
Let the rhythm take control
In the night, hearts unfold
Strolling on the sandy shores, waves embrace
Sun sinking, colors pour, paints a face
Laughter mingling with the night (echoed song)
Whisper secrets hold me tight all along
Stars are mirrors of our dreams (sparkling high)
In your eyes the moonlight gleams (my heart sighs)
Gently swaying to the beat (soft and slow)
With you life feels so sweet
Let it flow
Underneath this velvet sky
World unseen
Just you and I know goodbye
Silver sheen
Crickets sing their lullaby (melodies)
Hand in hand we'll
