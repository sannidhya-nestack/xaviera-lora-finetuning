When the sun dips low and shadows grow low
The rhythm of our hearts flows with a quiet song
Join with me under the twilight's glow
Let's dance where the evening whispers softly though
Soft breeze through the willow, gentle sway
Golden gloves of sunlight, endless day
Blue waves kissing shorelines as it's played
Dreams float on the tide, sail away
Stars soon will glitter, nights on choir
Whispers in the silence, hidden fire
Moonlight paints the rooftops, night desire
Wrapped in twilight's promise, hearts are tired
Twilight beckons gently, evening call
Lost in tender moments, we stand tall
Hands that weave with magic in lost thrall
Steps that tell our story through it all
Lanterns glow as secrets soft reveal
Laughter under moonlight so surreal
Eyes that share a language hidden seal
Moments turn to always, love's ideal
Love, love, love
Stars soon will glitter
Nights on quiet whispers in the silence
Endless day, blue waves kissing shorelines
Endless play, dreams float on the tide
Sail away, stars soon will glitter
Nights on choir, whispers in the silence
In this day, blue waves kissing shorelines
Endless play, dreams float on the tide
Twilight beckons gently, evening call
Whispers in the silent, hidden fire
Moonlight paints the rooftop, night desire
Wrapped in twilight's promise, hearts are tired
Twilight beckons gently, evening call
Whispers in the silent, hidden fire
Moonlight paints the rooftop, night desire
Wrapped in twilight's promise, hearts are tired
Know it all
Lanterns glow with secrets
Soft reveal
Laughter on the moon
