Let the rhythm sway
Softly feel the warm breeze drift by
With every whisper I sing
A story of you and I
In the still of the night
When the stars shine so bright (when the night's gone)
Our hearts dance and fly (tight and brave)
In the gentle twilight (sleeper at night)
Eyes meet across the room (suffer)
Shared smiles dissolve the gloom (perfect dream)
Whispers touch like perfume (soft allure)
In this endless cartoon (so)
Together we sway (night's caress)
In the sweet bossa way (no distress)
Through endless songs we play (like a quake)
the break of day (yither-theredness)
Waves kiss the shore (silently)
Feelings we can't ignore (wild and free)
Lost forever
Of you and me
In life's simple decor
Eternally
Hand in hand we glide
Gentle day
Love defined in stride
Sweet romance
Harmony our guide
