In the soft sound, but in the empty last song
Gentle whispers through the tree
Ocean song in the twilight glow
Dancing lightly on the breeze
Underneath the stars we sway
Lost in time we drift away
Footsteps soft on moonlit sand
Hearts in rhythm hand in hand
Silence speaks in secret tones
We confess the love to shore
In the dance we're not alone
We become the dreams they bore
Underneath the stars we sway
Lost in time we drift away
Footsteps soft on moonlit sand
Hearts in rhythm hand in hand
Underneath the stars we sway
Lost in time we drift away
Footsteps soft on moonlit sand
Hearts in rhythm hand in hand
Every moment feels it's new
Painting skies in shades of blue
In your eyes I see the dawn
Echoes linger even when we're gone
In the night, the gentle song
Lingers on as we belong
In this dream that's come alive
Love's a dance where we rise
