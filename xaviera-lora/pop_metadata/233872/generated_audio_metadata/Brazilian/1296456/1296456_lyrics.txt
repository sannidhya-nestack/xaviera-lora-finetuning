In the suckle of a quiet evening
Where the seaside meets the shore
Let's let the melody guide our feelings
And let our hearts explore
Underneath the moonlit skies (so serene)
Whispers of the ocean's sighs (to speak)
Gazing into your warm eyes, deep and green
Moments passing gently by like a dream
Swaying to this subtle beat in the breeze
Feelings sand beneath our feet, warm and free
Watching as our heartbeats meet, you and me
Night becomes a sweet retreat, let it be
Softly play the sweetest tune, deep inside
After dancing with the moon, gentle tide
Lost within a starry swoon
Open wide hearts in perfect harmony, side by side
