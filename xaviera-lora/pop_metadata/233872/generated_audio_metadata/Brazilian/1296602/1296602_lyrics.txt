Under the sultry sun
With rhythm swaying through the air
Feel the warmth of our song
Close your eyes and drift away
In the corner of the cafe
Gentle sway
We find ourselves once more
Open door, a coffee black and strong
Ride along as hearts begin to soar
And implore, candles flicker in the night
Soft light, shadows dance and play
Steal away
Your eyes meet mine again
No refrain
In this tender ballet
Come what may
Whispers in the breeze
Easy tease
Carried on the sea
Floating free
A moment caught in time
Subtle rhyme
Two hearts in harmony
You and me
Footprints in the sand and in hand
Fingers intertwine, yours and mine
Beneath the moonlit sky, you and I
Our souls begin to shine so bright
