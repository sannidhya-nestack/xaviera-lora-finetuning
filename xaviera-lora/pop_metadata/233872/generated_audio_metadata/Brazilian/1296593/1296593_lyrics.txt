To the real moonlight we sway
A dance that only hearts can trace
Softly we glide through the night
Gentle like the ocean's tidings
Stars above in silent floodings
Love's a hidden precious gaze
Music plays from distant shores
Waves are crashing on the coast
Moments lived in nothing more
Time will drift us ever short
Underneath the cooling shade
Rhythms twine and serenade
Every step so perfectly made
Dancing close with love displayed (so good, so good)
Moonlight dances in your eyes (so amazing)
Magic wrapped in summer skies (floating deep)
Promises that never die (is here)
Swaying'til the morning rise (oh, oh, oh)
Echoes of a melody (oh, oh, oh)
Moments melt so tenderly (perfect night)
In the spell we find we're free (free tonight)
Bonded for eternity (lost in light)
