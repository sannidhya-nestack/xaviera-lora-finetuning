Beneath the twilight glow, where summer ticks and tocks
Seeds of wonder, listen close and you will know
All the secrets time unlocks, forever wonders
Walking down the cobbled streets
Whispers float upon the breeze
Every corner holds a beat
Music sways among the trees
Stars align above the bay
Hearts are swayed and words will play
In the waves they drift away
Under Rio's night display
Stars align above the bay
Hearts are swayed and words will play
Stars align above the bay
Hearts are swayed and words will play
In the waves they drift away
Under Rio's night display
Weaved in dust's enchanting flare
Center Rio's night display
Stars align above the bay
Hearts are swayed and words will play
In the waves they drift away
Under Rio's night display
Stars align above the bay
Hearts are swayed and words will play
Stars align above the bay
Hearts are swayed and words will play
