Take your time
Take it nice and easy'cause I'm
Gonna be around from now on
When you need me, I'll be there
Take your time
Let's make it a nice easy climb
We can reach the highest of mountains
You just have to care
Too worried, slow right down
Now what's the hurry?
Take your time
Don't try to make everything rhyme
Take the tempo slow and freely
Just take your time
Why the frown? No need to worry
Slow right down, now what's the hurry?
Take your time, don't try to make everything right
Take the tempo slow and freely
Just take your time
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Let me run, run
