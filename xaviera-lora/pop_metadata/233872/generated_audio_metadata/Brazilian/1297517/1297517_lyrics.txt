Hold my hand, we'll meet the stars tonight
Whisper dreams that never fade from sight
Our hearts dance to rhythms life can't break
Timeless love in every breath we take
In the twilight our shadows softly blend
Stories old yet eternally bend
Through the silence where our secrets flow
Timeless love in whispers soft and slow
Eternal whispers in the air
Love's sweet music everywhere
In your eyes a world so bright
Timeless love in moonlit night
The world may turn but we remain as one
Found in love under the endless sun
With every touch a moment so divine
Timeless love that echoes through all time
Years may pass and seasons drift away
Yet our love forever here to stay
