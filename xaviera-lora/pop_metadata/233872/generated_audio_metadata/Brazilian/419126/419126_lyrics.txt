I love your smile, it sparkles like the sunshine
Bouncing off the waters of the sea
And when you smile at me, the child inside begins to laugh
And not one thing can bother me, for I'm a child again, and I am free
I love your smile, it shimmers like the moonlight
Draped across the mountains by the sea
And when you smile at me
I see my dreams have come to life
And not one thing can bother me
For it's come true
My wildest fantasy
Smile that smile, a little smile
That special smile for me, oh
Smile that smile, a little while
For all the world to see
What it can be
Smile that smile, a little smile
That special smile for me, oh
Smile that smile, a little while
For all the world to see
What it can be
I love your smile, it warms me like a soft breeze
Carried on the currents of the sea
And when you smile at me
The child inside begins to laugh
And not one thing can bother me
For I'm a child again and I am free
