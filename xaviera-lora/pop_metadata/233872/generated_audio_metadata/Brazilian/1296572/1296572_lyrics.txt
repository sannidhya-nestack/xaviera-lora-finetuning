In this moonlit night just dance a quiet tangle under the stars
Sway with me under the moonlight glow
Embrace me tight
Whisper secrets the night only knows
Hearts aligned
Breath of the ocean caressing our skin
Waves
Rhythms of shadows where our feet have been
Dance again
Midnight blue paints the sky with dreams
Stars collide
Holding each other where bursting at seams
Hearts reside
Soft melodies kiss our sleepy eyes
Dreamer sound
Gliding through midnight where timelessness flies
Love unbound
Tangled in moonbeams we lose ourselves
Lost in light
Echoes of laughter cast magic spells
Midnight bright
Warm breezes play with the strands of your hair
Soft and free
