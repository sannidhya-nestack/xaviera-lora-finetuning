I confess I know nothing about you
I confess I care too much about you
Those luminous eyes see deep into my soul
I am filled with notes of music from you
Why do I feel this way for you?
Why does your name thrill me so?
Why do I care so much for you?
Have we met before?
Spend all my time thinking of you
Morning, night, noon and day
Seasons change, I age thinking of you
Spend all my time thinking of you
I confess asleep thinking of you
I keep getting messages from you
In my dreams, in my waking hours
The signs are all about you
Why do I feel this way for you?
Why does your name thrill me so
Why do I care so much for you
Have we met before
Spend all my time thinking of you
Moon and night, noon and day
Seasons change, I age thinking of you
Spend all my time thinking of you
Spend all my time thinking of you
Moon and night, noon and day
Seasons change, I age thinking of you
Spend all my time thinking of you
Thinking of you
