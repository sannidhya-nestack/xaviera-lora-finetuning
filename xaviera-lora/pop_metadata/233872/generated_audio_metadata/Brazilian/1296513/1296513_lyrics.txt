When the moon whispers secrets and the stars become our guide
Come with me on a journey where the midnight sun won't hide
The ocean breeze, it strokes your hair (and this is quiet)
Candles flicker in the night (softly spoken)
Dance with me by twilight's glare (shining and swaying)
Lost in moments pure delight (heart so)
The city sleeps yet we remain (dreaming souls)
Side by side in a silent world (beveled tales)
Every heartbeat makes it plain (proposal green)
In your eyes our futures twirl (endless sales)
Oh the midnight sun won't set (forever shining)
Holding on to what we've got (eternal spark)
In the night we can't et (dreams aligning)
Love that always hits the spot (lovers more)
Every step a gentle sway (through the trails)
Time becomes a distant friend (powers bending)
In your arms I want to stay (things never go)
A lovely dance that has no end (love on end)
Oh, the midnight sun won't set (forever shining)
Holding on to what we've got (eternal spark)
In the night we can't et (dreams aligning)
Love that always hits the spot (lovers' lot)
