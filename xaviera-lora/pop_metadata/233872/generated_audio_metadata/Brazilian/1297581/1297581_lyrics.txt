Beneath the shade of old oak trees
Whispers of our love's embrace
Hearts entwined like ocean breeze
With timeless grace in our space
Moonlit nights by soft-lipped seas
Your laughter echoes through the stars
Every kiss is poetry
A timeless dance beneath Mars
In every moment you and I find eternity in each glance
Timeless love that will not die, a serenade of romance
Sunsets paint the skies with gold
Our love story softly told
In your eyes the future's bold
Together we grow old
Time may pass and seasons change
Yet our love remains the same
In the chorus of life's range
Forever we'll know love's name
Through the storms and sunny days
In your arms I find my ways
Timeless love forever stays
A song in endless praise
