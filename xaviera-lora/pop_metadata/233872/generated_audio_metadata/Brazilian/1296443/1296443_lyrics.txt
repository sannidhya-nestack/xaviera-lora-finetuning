Underneath the moonlit sky where tides hum softly, hush
We'll sway to the rhythm of the night in a gentle rush, hush
Listen to the whispers of the ocean's secret touch
Together we'll find the magic in the silence
Walking by the shoreline (waves to it)
Stars spill on the sea (a twilight film)
Footprints in the sand (night moving)
Holding hands with you (a sweet moment)
Waves weave lullabies (so tender)
The breeze tells tales of love (remember)
A moment caught in time (forever)
Your eyes meet mine
We surrender
Underneath the calm night sky
Dreams
We'll find our hearts delight
I'm on a breeze
The melody of hearts
Softly bleeds
Dancing to our song
Solve and cease
Echoes from the ocean's floor
Whispers call
Nature's silent roar
Stand tall
Through life's open door (free fall)
Love and so much more (ride and throw)
The night hums a serenade (soft curve)
Our spirits begin to fade (painless truth)
Faithless twilight parade (we cling still)
Together we have it made (endless bliss)
