Close your eyes and feel the sway
Let the rhythm lead your way
Breathe in deep and hear the sea
Whispers flow so naturally
Stars are twinkling up above
In the night
Waves are gently kissing shores
Soft delight
Moonlight dances on the sand
Holding tight
Heartbeats sink with oceans roar
All is right
Leaves are rustling in the trees
Whispering dreams, flowers bloom with morning dew
Crystal beams, birds are singing sweet rephrase
Melody gleams
Every moment feels so new
Endless schemes
Close your eyes and breathe the night
Pure embrace
Feel the magic in the air
Gentle grace
Hold this time and never let
Sweet heist
Every breath a silent prayer
Soft guitar and sultry notes
So sorry
Warmth of sun on golden skin
Perfect sheen
Life is but a winding road
Path unseen, come and dance away the dim
Soul's routine, close your eyes and breathe the night
Pure embrace, feel the magic in you
