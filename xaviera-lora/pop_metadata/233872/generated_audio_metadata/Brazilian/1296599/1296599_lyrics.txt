Close your eyes and feel the rain outside your window
Can you hear the rhythm dance upon the ground?
Let's sway with the whispers of the midnight echo
Together we'll be lost and then found
Skylights twinkle like a dream (twinkle so bright)
Whispers of the night we cling (reach the sky)
I step so gentle on the green (take you to the sea)
In this dance we're so serene (hold on to)
Feel the ocean's gentle sway
Feel the music softly play (through the night)
Night will turn to gentle day (sun will shine)
In your arms I long to stay (never slow)
Moonlight's lingy and caress (soft and soft)
Hearts are beating with thinness (and we)
Echoes of our sweet success (let it flow)
In this endless song we press (we both)
Mildly oceans gentle sway
Hear the music softly play
Night will turn to gentle day
In your arms I long to stay
Do do do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo, doo doo, doo doo, doo doo, doo doo, doo doo, doo
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo
