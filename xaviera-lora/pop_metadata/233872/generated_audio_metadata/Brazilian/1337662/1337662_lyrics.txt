Golden rays touch the sand
Drinks in hand, it's all so grand
Laughter ripples in the air
No worries, no space for care
Gentle waves, they kiss the shore
Music plays, we ask for more
Barefoot dancers spinning round
Happiness in every sound
Feel the rhythm, let it fly
Brazil's heartbeat fills the sky
Under the stars where we belong
This beach will sing our endless song
Feel the rhythm, let it fly
Brazil's heartbeat fills the sky
Under the stars where we belong
This beach will sing our endless song
Pineapple sky, paint the view
Smiles as white as oceans blue
The sea breeze whispers a melody
Echoing pure serenity
Drums that talk, guitars that hum
This is where forever comes
Dancing souls under the moon
The beach, a timeless tune
Feel the rhythm, let it fly
Brazil's heartbeat fills the sky
Under the stars where we belong
This beach will sing our endless song
Feel the rhythm let it fly
Brazil's heartbeat fills the sky
Under the stars where we belong
This beach will sing our endless song
