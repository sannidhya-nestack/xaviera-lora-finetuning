Then they tear you under the starlit sky, surreal
Where the rhythm flows, it's soft as whispers
And love dances through the night
By the moonlight, the city grows soft among the stars
Soft somber tunes play on the breeze, music never far
Lover's footsteps on cobblestone, sweet serenades, a distant hum, let the magic start
Golden sand beneath our feet, whispering the call
City lights mixed with the sea, endless as a wall
Dreams are painted in the air, colors bright and free
Holding close we sway to song, perfect harmony
Whispers in me oh soft and low
Dancing twilight shadows glow
Dreams are painted in the air
Holding close we sway to song
Whispers in me oh soft and low
Dancing twilight shadows glow
Stars above the oceans kiss
Secret moments shared like this
Palms are swaying with the beat
Moving like the tide
Every step we take's complete
In this dream we glide
Mystic nights of joy and grace
Hold me tight tonight
Lost within your warm embrace
Love is taking flight
Waves of love to fill the air
In your eyes I see my prayer
Life is vibrant in this town
Hearts together settle down
Waves of laughter fill the air
In your eyes I see my prayer
Life is vibrant in this town
