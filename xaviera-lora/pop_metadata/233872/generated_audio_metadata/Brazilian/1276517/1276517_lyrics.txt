Underneath the evening sky, in the gentle warm embrace
We dance quietly side by side, to a melody of grace
Whispered dreams of lulled oceans, softly swaying in the night
Heartbeats, echoes and emotions
the break of morning light
Stars above, reflecting eyes
Full of stories yet untold
In the rhythm, time lies
Secrets in the night unfold
Whispered dreams of moonlit oceans
Softly swaying in the night
Heart beats, echoes and emotions
the break of morning light
Stars above, reflecting eyes
Full of stories yet untold
In the rhythm, time lies
Secrets in the night unfold
Whispered dreams of moonlit oceans
Softly swaying in the night
Heartbeats echo tender motions
the break of morning light
Every note a promise made
Every step a sweet reply
In this dance of serenade
Carried on a gentle sigh
Now the night invites the dawn
With the colours far ahead
We remain, though night has gone
In a song we've softly said
Now the night invites the dawn
With the colours far ahead
We remain, though night has gone
In the song we've softly said
