Underneath the rustling leaves
Golden breeze whispers secrets
Tonight the moonlight weaves
Casting dreams with no regrets
Walking through a twilight path
Awfully hung
Stars above in secret laugh
Blushing low
Listening to the night wind song
Gentle call
Feel the rhythm all night long
Hearts will know
Ocean waves embrace the shore
Moonlight's kiss
Ebb and flow forevermore
Ocean side
Shadows dance with ancient lore
Whispers true
Here is where our spirits soar
Wilderness
Every moment feels so right
Time stands still
Holding onto dreams so tight
Dawning thrill
Whispered words float on the breeze
Light will mend
Love and laughter both
Peace words ascend
Petals fall with grace divine
Nature's art
Peaceful calm intertwined
Silent heart
Moonlit serenades will find midnight's way
Melodies of sweetest kind, night and day
Every moment feels so right, time stands still
Holding onto dreams so tight, dawning through
Whispered words float on the breeze like will-men
Love and laughter both appease hearts, listen
Better
Ooh, let us fall with grace divine
Nature's heart, peaceful calm
Intertwined, silent heart
Bullet serenades will find midnight's way
Love and laughter both the king's hearts ascend
