Golden sun in the sand
Start to run hand in hand
Then you lap through your smile
Photograph
Holds your style
Boats are sailing
Tanking now
Trying to catch the wind
Barefoot walking in the sea
We were talking feeling free
Stepping over tide of the streams
See forever in our dreams
Hearts are beating faster now
Feel the love within
See all the magic of the world in your eyes
Now so much beauty has unfurled before my eyes
And I'm in heaven when you're curled in my arms
Keeping me away from harm
Golden sun in the sand
Start to run hand in hand
Then you laugh through your smile
Photograph holds your style
Boats are sailing, tanking now
Trying to catch the wind
See all the magic of the world in your eyes
Now so much beauty has unfurled before my eyes
And I'm in heaven when you curl in my arms
Keeping me away from harm
Barefoot walking in the sea
We were talking feeling free
Stepping over tidal streams
Sea forever in our dreams
