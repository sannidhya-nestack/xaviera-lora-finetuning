Underneath the moonlit sky we sway
Whispers in the gentle night we stay
Rhythms of the ocean soft and clear
In this moment time just disappears
Dance with me, hold me close, let's fly
Feel the breeze, hear the waves' sweet sigh
In this warm embrace with stars above
All we need is here lost in love
Footsteps tracing patterns on the sand
Guided by a distant tender hand
Dreams begin to blossom in the air
In this quiet world worries bear
Dance with me, hold me close, let's glide
Feel the pulse down by the ocean side
In this tender embrace, beneath the moon, let our hearts become the only two
