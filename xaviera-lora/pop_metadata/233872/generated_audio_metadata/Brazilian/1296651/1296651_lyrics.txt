Down by the shore where the breeze whispers
He cuts the love story in half
Under the moon's delicate gaze
Soft sands beneath the open sky
Moonlight guiding the waves
Whispers of waves singing calling us in
Your touch like a dream
The smell of every palm tree swaying slow
Dance to our tune
Your eyes like twilight (sweet rhythm)
Sweet melodies flow (just you and me)
The world fades away (lost on the street)
Gentle waves talking (our love on display)
Let's be together (like shells in the breeze through your hair)
Calling your mother night's blanket
Nothing's the silent promises
Whispered with groanings like bees
Time, child, can't you help?
Candles flickering
Shadows entwined
Your hand in mine
Our souls aligned
Poisons flush red
Morning will rise
But here in your arms, I'm paradise
The ocean song, swayed by the tide
Wrapped in this moment, nothing to hide
