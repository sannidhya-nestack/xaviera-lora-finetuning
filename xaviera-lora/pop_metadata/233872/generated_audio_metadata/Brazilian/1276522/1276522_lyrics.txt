In the golden hue of sunset
Where the ocean meets the breeze
Gentle whispers weave a love song
Dancing through the lazy trees
Softly swaying, lost in shadows
Where the waves caress the shore
In this moment, time is endless
Could we ask for something more?
With your hand in mine we're dreaming
As the stars begin to play
In the rhythm of the night sky
We find words we need not say
Softly swaying, lost in shadows
Where the waves caress the shore
In this moment, time is endless
Could we ask for something more?
With your hand in mine, we're dreaming
As the stars begin to play
In the rhythm of the night sky
We find words we need not say
Softly swaying
Lost in shadows
Where the waves caress the shore
In this moment
Time is endless
Could we ask for something more?
Moonlight paints a tender picture
On a canvas wide and deep
Every heartbeat like a whisper
In this serenade we keep
As the twilight fades to silence
And the world begins to slow
In your arms I feel the music of a love
