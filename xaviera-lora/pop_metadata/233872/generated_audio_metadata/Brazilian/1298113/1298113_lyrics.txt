Under moonlit skies we sway
In our gently woven dreams
Stars above seem far away
But close to us it seems
Golden sand beneath our feet
Whispers from the ocean deep
Hearts in timeless rhythm beat
Promises we vow to keep
In your arms I find my home
Endless love where we both roam
Through the ages we'll remain
Bound by joy yet free from pain
Sunrise paints the morning blue
Chasing shadows from the night
Hand in hand we see it through
Living love in purest light
