Walking through the twilight haze
Nights are long but in the days
Laughter calls but slips away
Memories in soft display
Whispers of the ocean side
Stars reflect in moonlit sky
Hidden thoughts begin to rise
Lost in timeless lullabies
Echoes of otten dreams
Flow with gentle water streams
Heartbeats link with distant beams
Life is more than what it seems
Whispers of the ocean side
Stars reflect in moonlit sky
Hidden thoughts begin to rise
Lost in timeless lullabies
Oh, the scent of jasmine sweet
Guides us down the cobbled street
Voices mingle soft and neat
Bossin' over hearts that meet
Whispers of the ocean side
Stars reflect in moonlit sky
Hidden thoughts begin to rise
Lost in timeless lullabies
