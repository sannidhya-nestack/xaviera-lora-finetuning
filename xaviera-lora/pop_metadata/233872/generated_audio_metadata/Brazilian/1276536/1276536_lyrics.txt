Gently swaying in the evening breeze
Moonlight whispers through the palm trees
Soft embraces in a night so warm
Hearts are dancing to their own sweet form
Underneath the starlit sky
Every moment seems to sigh
Time stands still, we drift away
In this tender night we'll stay
Laughter echoes where the sea meets sand
Fingers tracing dreams across the land
Secret glances, eyes that shimmer bright
In the quiet glow of our delight
Underneath the starlit sky
Every moment seems to sigh
Time stands still, we drift away
In this tender night we'll stay
Magic lingers in the air
With you there's nothing to compare
Hold me close and we'll become
A melody that softly hums
While the world is fast asleep
In our hearts this love will keep
Gentle waves
