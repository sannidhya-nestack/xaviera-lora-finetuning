Under the moons of silver glow
The night invites us to sway slow
Let's dance until the morning shows
Feel the rhythm, let it all flow
In the whispers of the night
Gentle breeze
Starry skies above in sight
Shining keys
Footsteps tracing dreams so bright
Hidden seas
Holding on with all our might
Feel the heat
Moonlight dances on your face
Soft embrace
Moves with effort, buff and scrace
Hidden place
Lost in our own secret space
Timeless chase
Find a world that we can taste
Lovers lace
Moonlight dances on your face
Soft embrace
Moves with effortless grace
Hidden place
Lost in our own secret space
Timeless chase
Find a world that we can taste
Lovers lace
Hearts are beating, never late in the night
Echoes of a perfect day, such delight
Waves of passion, can't wait, purest light
Dancing'til the dawn's first gate, holding tight
Moments captured in this way
Endless too
Night forever will obey
Under the moon
Voices melt away to say
Here too soon
Close your eyes let dreams replay
Timeless moon
Underneath the starlit skies
Endless seas
Chasing shadows as they rise
Whisper please
Painting worlds before our eyes
Gentle tease
In this dance there are no lies
Evening's breeze
Underneath the starlit sky
