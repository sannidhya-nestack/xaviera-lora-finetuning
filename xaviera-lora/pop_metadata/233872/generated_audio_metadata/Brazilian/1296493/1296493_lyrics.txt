In the whispers of the wind
In the sway of endless nights
We find our melody
Walking by the shore, listening to the waves
Feeling every beat, dancing in the dust
Sipping on the breeze, humming a soft tune
Holding on to dreams, swaying to the rhythm
Of last nights and stars above
Whispers in the dark as they kiss the sky
Moments that we shared
Love that fills the air
Meeting at the dawn, the night at break
Touching with a glance, down low
Floating on a cloud, drift away
Feeling all the love, it's here to stay
Time may pass us by, feel like a memory
Memories remain (there are still) every little moment (every state) captured in a song (the endless days) time may pass us by (don't let go) memories remain (there are still) every little moment (every state) captured in a song (the endless days)
