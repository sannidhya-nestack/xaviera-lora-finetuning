The ocean whispers secrets in the waves' gentle call
With the rhythm of the heartbeats we sway under its thrall
The moonlight dances, a story left untold
In every touch and sound we revel in the moments before
The breeze sings softly through the leaves of old
Every heartbeat's message, a tale of us forever (as time succumbs)
The stars align above (in our path)
With a silent vow they shine
Connecting you and I (in their tracks)
Find our way together (the road of our land)
The twilight skies we meet (soft embrace)
With every whispered note (find a place)
Our spirits start to float (slowly trace)
Toward the dreams we chase (hearts we trace)
In every step we take (footsteps play)
A rhythm all our own
In the silence we speak (parts amend)
A melody of two souls (we ascend)
And every step we take
