In whispers of the evening tide
Your voice a melody so wide
Moonlight brushes on your face
Timeless love and sweet embrace
Our hearts, they dance an ageless song
In dreams where we both belong
The stars above our silent guide
Eternal rhythm side by side
In every breeze, a lover's pledge will never edge close to the ledge
Hand in hand through years we glide
Forever's tune, our love's pride
With every dawn, a fresh sunrise, a story told through smiling eyes
Memories like waves they blend, no beginning, never end
Those seasons change as time turns fast
Our moments, they forever last
In gardens where the roses bloom
Our love's the sweetest perfume
In every breeze, a lover's pledge
Will never edge close to the ledge
Hand in hand through years we glide
Forever's tune, our love's pledge
