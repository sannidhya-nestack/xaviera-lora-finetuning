Let the waves sway you
Soft sand underfoot
And a cool breeze brush your face
In these rhythmic tides we find our place
Sunset paints the sky
Gentle whispers fly (fly, chase)
Seashells by our feet (I see night space)
Hearts in time, they beat this gentle pace
Stars begin to shine on Everest's cube
Moonlight draws a line on the silver few
Hand in hand we glide upon so true
Silhouettes collide in twilight's hue
Tides against the shore, relentless frying
We will ask no more (we borrow time)
Every moment's gold (an ageless climb)
Love forevermore in perfect prime
Breezes carry tunes (a soft refrain)
Humming gentle prunes (a sweet domain)
Dancing under moon
