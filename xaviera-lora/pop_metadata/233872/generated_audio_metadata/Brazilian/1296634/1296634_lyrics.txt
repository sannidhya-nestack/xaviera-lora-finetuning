Light of earth, did you feel the rhythm of the day?
Sunlight dances on shore, golden light
Seagulls laughing, never bore, endless flight
Whispers of the ocean blue, soft embrace
Time stands still, just me and you
Dreamers place morning dew upon the sand
Crystal clear footprints there but never planned
Disappear palm trees swaying with the breeze
Gentle sway summer days that never cease
Endless play waves that crash with gentle sound
Soothing time
Lost and found without a bound
Where it hides
Hearts that beat in perfect time
Sweet delight
In this dance that feels sublime
Starry night
Moonlight shines on waters clear
Silver glow, feel the magic drawing near
Soft and slow, eyes that speak without a word
Silent song, in this dream where love is stirred
All night long
Morning dew upon the sand
Crystal clear
Footprints there but never planned
Disappeared
Palm trees swaying with the breeze
Gentle sway
Summer days that never cease
Endless place
Waves that crash with gentle sound
Soothing tide
Lost and found without a bound
Wearing hearts that beat in perfect time
Sweet delight in this dance that feels sublime
Story night
