I wonder how to suit you
I can't find my way to you
I wonder how to transform
I can't find the words to make you understand
Catching a plane seems so easy
Catching a train too
Catching a ride to you seems such a dream
A dream from childhood
Show me the way I can reach you
What I need to say to get the message through
Show me the way to reach you
What songs to sing to breathe through
I wonder how the dance works
Will the steps lead me right to you
I wonder how this life works
Will the steps lead me right to your door
Catching a plane seems so easy
Catching a train too
Catching the rhyme to you seems such a dream
A dream from childhood
Show me the way I can reach you
What I need to say to get the message through
Show me the way to reach you
What songs to sing to breathe through
Show me the way I can reach you
What I need to say to get the message through
Show me the way to reach you
What songs to sing to breathe through
Show me the way to reach you
What songs to sing to breeze through
