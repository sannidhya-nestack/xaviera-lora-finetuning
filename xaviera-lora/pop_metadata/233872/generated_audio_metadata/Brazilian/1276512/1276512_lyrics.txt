Whispered secrets in the twilight
Underneath the moonlit sky
Gentle waves caress the shoreline
As the night slowly goes by
We are swaying to the rhythm
Of a melody so sweet
In this moment, we are timeless
Two hearts in tranquil beat
In the nighttime, soft surrender
Stars are waltzing overhead
Every note a tender promise
Every word left unsaid
Feel the breeze it tells a story
Of a love that's ever true
Wrapped in warmth of summer's glory
I'm forever lost in you
Let our laughter paint the silence
While the shadows dance and play
In the quiet of the evening
All our worries fade away
In the nighttime, soft surrender
Stars are waltzing overhead
Every note a tender promise
Every word left unsaid
