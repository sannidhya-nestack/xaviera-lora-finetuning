Beneath our swaying palms
Echoes of the sea songs
Where daylight softly calms
We dance in endless charms
Moonlit skies above the shore
Whispers call us
Waves that sing forevermore
Dancing blue dogs
Sand that warms from core to core
Heart's alive now
Steps that trace a folklore
Memories glowing
Sunlight shadows on our skin
Golden moments
Tunes of love and life begin
Softly playing
Breath of summer's gentle spin
Sweet embracing
In our souls a secret grin
Timeless laughter
Birds serenade the sunny scene
Melodies weaving
Leaves create a canopy screen
Green dream shelter
Every glance is so serene
Eyes are meeting
Where our world is evergreen
Love forever
Echoes of the heart's delight
Soft reflections
Moon draws closer every night
