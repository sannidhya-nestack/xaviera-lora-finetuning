Under the soft moonlight by the shore
With every wave we adore
Let's dance with the stars above in this place
We call love
You hold my hand and we sway (gentle breeze)
Your eyes catch mine and they stay endless seeds
Every step feels just like golden sand
Together we rewrite the night in this land
Lost in your smile tonight
We watch the city lights ignite
Soft halo
Every word's a sweet delight
Whisper low
In your arms it feels so right
Hearts aglow
Your laughter floats on the breeze, tender sound
Time stops and we find ease, love profound
