I cannot move
Shallow sets all on a place
Catch up with the sunrise
We'll leave it all behind
And you
Will shelter me with its light
And I will hold you to the sky
Will save me from the night
Don't you dare look back at me
You left me in the cold
This is how the story ends, yeah
And you
Will shelter me with light
And I will hold you to the sky
Will save me from the night
And you will shelter me with light
And I will hold you to the sky
Will shelter me with light
Will save me from the night
