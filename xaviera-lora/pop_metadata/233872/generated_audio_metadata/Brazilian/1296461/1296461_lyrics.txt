Ladies and gentlemen, close your eyes
And let the rhythm take you to the shores of love
A place where the waves sing their own melodies
Whispers on the breeze tonight (I'm the moonlight)
Softly calling your name now (without shame)
Stars are dancing in the sky (tell us why)
Feel the magic in the air
(If you dare)
Underneath the silver glow
(Don't let go)
Hearts are beating in our dreams
(Softly)
In the moment we'll let it flow
(We all know)
Having ties of a love supreme
(We're gonna escape)
Walking on the golden sand
(In hand in hand)
Listening to the ocean play (night and day)
Every whisper, every laugh (right or wrong)
In this place we long to stay (find our way)
Time is but a fleeting guest (at last)
Hold each second, make it last (hold fast)
In the rhythm of our hearts, new restart
Write our story, make it fast
Underneath the silver glow (Don't let go)
Hearts are beating in our dreams (Softly cling)
In the moment let it flow (We all know)
Ebbing tides of a love supreme (Now you see)
Underneath the silver glow (don't let go)
Hearts are beating in a dream (softly cling)
In the moment let it flow (we all know)
Heaven's heights of love supreme (can't escape)
