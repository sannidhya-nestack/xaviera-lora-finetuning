I'm a man of many faces
Maybe you've seen me before
Makes no difference where you have seen me
I won't be there no more
I'm a man of many faces
Sometimes happy sometimes not
It depends on where I have been
And what I might have got
Gotta go, can't you see that I just can't stay here
But I don't know why
I'm a man who must travel on'til the day I die
I'm a man of many faces
Maybe you've seen me before
Makes no difference where you have seen me
I won't be there no more
Gotta go, can't you see that I just can't stay here
But I don't know why
I'm a man who must travel on'til the day I die
I'm a man of many faces
Maybe you've seen me before
Makes no difference where you have seen me
I won't be there no more
Makes no difference where you have seen me
I won't be there no more
