In that gentle sway of evening
As the golden sun says goodbye
We find the rhythm in our footsteps
Soft whispers float on by
Meet me where the palms are swaying
Where the ocean kisses the shore
In this moment time is fading
I couldn't ask for more
Eyes that sparkle like the starlight
Soft melodies in the air
Every note a sweet connection
In this warm enchanted affair
Meet me where the palms are swaying
Where the ocean kisses the shore
In this moment time is fading
I couldn't ask for more
Hold the night close in your arms
As the moonlight dances clean
With every beat our hearts align
Flowing through a timeless dream
Meet me where the palms are swinging
Where the ocean kisses the shore
In this moment time is fading
I couldn't ask for more
Hold the night close in your arms
As the moonlight dances clean
With every beat our hearts align
Flowing through a timeless dream
Meet me where shadows linger
Where the sea meets the open sky
