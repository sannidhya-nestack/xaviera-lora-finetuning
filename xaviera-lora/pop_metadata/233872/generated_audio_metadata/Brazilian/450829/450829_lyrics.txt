Tropical December, I can still remember
Basking in the glow of mountain ice and snow
You in your sunglasses
Through the windy passes
Led me to a spot
Where bitter cold was steamy hot
Tropical December
The sun burned the mountain sky Bahama blue
I felt a radiance and it was you
Through the chill of winter
I can feel the love within my soul
Burning like an ember
That keeps away that January cold
Tropical December
Tropical descender
The sun burned the mountains sky
Bahama blue
I felt a radiance and it was you
Through the chill of winter
I can feel the love within my soul
Burning like an amber
That keeps away that January cold
Tropical December
