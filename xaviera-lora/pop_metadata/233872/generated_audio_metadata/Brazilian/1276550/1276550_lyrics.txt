In the morning's soft embrace
Whispers of the ocean sigh
Golden sun begins to lace
With the gentle waking sky
Feel the breeze caress your face
Dreams are dancing in the air
Time slows down in this warm place
Hearts are light and free from care
Walk with me along the shore
Where the waves kiss the sand
In this world there's so much more
Than we could ever plan
You and I beneath the trees
Leaves are painting shadows sweet
Carving moments like these
Life is swaying to the beat
Stars will join us in the night
Moonlight whispers softly to
Honest love a pure delight
In a world made just for two
Feel the rhythm in our souls
As we wander hand in hand
Life is full, we're truly whole
In this endless gentle land
Let the music carry you
Floating on a tender breeze
Every note is something new
Every moment, moment sees
