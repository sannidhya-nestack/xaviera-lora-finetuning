In a soft lit cafe where whispers clay
The gentle tunes float on the evening breeze
Close your eyes let the night steal away
Under the stars we sway with such ease
The rhythm of the sea it calls to me
Barefoot on the sand your hand in my hand
Moonlit waters where dreams become free
Dancing in the tide of love unplanned
Silence speaks in a language we know
A melody shared with sweet delight
Every smile shimmers with a glow
Wrapped in the warmth of the moonlit night
Harmony whispers in waves so serene
A gentle embrace in the lull of the night
Hearts beating softly in a boomery
Floating together in the tranquil light
The rhythm of the sea, it calls to me
Barefoot on the sand, your hand in my hand
Moonlit waters where dreams become free
Dancing in the tide, a love unplanned
In the quiet dawn, the night bids goodbye
But the melody lingers on
With the rising sun, we softly sigh
Carried by the tune, our hearts are drawn
