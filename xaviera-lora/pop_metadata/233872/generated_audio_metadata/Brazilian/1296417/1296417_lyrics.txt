Soft rhythms float like these spurs
Twilight's gentle kiss on us
In this moment love lingers
Our hearts beat with a rush
We drift along in perfect times (ways)
Moonlight dances through the leaves (shadows show)
Every touch a story told (warm embrace)
Underneath the starry glow
We find our place
Your laughter like a gentle breeze
Fills the night
Echoes through the calming waves
Pure delight
Holding you feels just like dreams
Soft and bright
In your eyes I see the sea
We're tangled in a sombre beat (lost in love)
Moving gently through the heat (stars above)
Every step a silent vow (your eyes shine)
Wrapped in love we take a bow
Whispers of the ocean tides
Calling us in the night our spirits glide
