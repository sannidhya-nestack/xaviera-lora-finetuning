When the sun dips low
And the city lights glow
Life slows down
To a tender rhythm
Let the evening's breeze carry us through
In this quiet moment let's find our tune
Shadows dance softly upon the wall
Street lights flicker like twilight calls
Footsteps echo on cobblestone lanes
Stars align in endless arms above
Underneath the canopy of night
Moonbeams sketch a fleeting sigh on the road trail
Our voices blend in soft delighting smiles
Time loses grip, we take flight, lingering miles
Whispers mix with the ocean's hum (soon they wake)
Every heartbeat speaks in gentle, strong (timeless gray)
