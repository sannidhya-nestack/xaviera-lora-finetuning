Under the stars a melody begins on the starlit night we sway let the rhythm take flight so let's dream together my love close your eyes feel the bossa kisses embrace like moonlight above here we dance by the ocean waves in the twilight and whisper secrets that say
A gentle touch on your cheek stays so serene
Love flows with each movement you chase, it's a dream
Soft breeze carries laughter and light, gently swoonin'
Our hearts align in the purest sight, nightly blooming
Feet brushing sand and the moon's glow, steps of grace
Whispered words that only we know, shared in space
Starlit night, we're dancing away, timeless floamin'
Growing hearts, the skies seem to sway, pure scent
Eyes meet, we're dancing away
And our souls reveal, the end true
Underneath the canopy seal, me and you
Clear notes of the guitar strings, softly strumming
Our hearts sing and minds take wing, hold me close let's never part
And the song in the symphony from the heart right along
Together in each other's arms in the twilight
Melody calms with its charms closed in your hand
Each sway whispers a love a new
Constant bliss under stars where dreams come true
Sealed with a kiss
Soft breeze carries laughter and light, gently swoonin'
Our hearts align in the purest sight, nightly bloomin'
Feet brushing sand and moon's glow, studs of grace
Whispered words that only we know, shared in space
Tall at night, we're dancing away, timeless bonin'
Glowing hearts, the skies seem to sway, pure scent
Eyes meet and our souls reveal, free and true
Whispered words that only we know
Me and you, clear notes of a guitar string
Softly strumming, our hearts sing and minds take wing
Pure sighs meet and our souls reveal
The untrue underneath a canopy seal
Me and you
