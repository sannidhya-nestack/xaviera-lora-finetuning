Let the rhythm of the waves take you away
To a place where worries dissolve in the sway
Close your eyes and feel the breeze caress
For this floating melody is the ultimate stress press
Sunset paints the sky in hues of dreams
Whispering light
Palm trees sway with serene, silent skis
Dancing night
Footprints vanish in the golden sand
Memories kiss
Find your heart in this enchanting land
Blissful mist
Moonlit ocean sings a lullaby
Soft and sweet
Stars above in a celestial tide, heaven-seek'd
Gentle tides embrace the shore with care, soothing hand
Harmony reigns in the salty air, timeless land
Lost in the music of the sea
Every note of breath that sets you free
Let the rhythm of the waves guide your way
Carry on
Feel the love in every sparkling spray
Dawn has drawn
Hear the whispers of the distant shore
Ancient tales
Feel the warmth in waves forevermore
Sunlit sails
Nature's voice, a song without an end
Eternal sound
In this dance we find we all transcend life unbound
Embrace the rhythm in your heart
