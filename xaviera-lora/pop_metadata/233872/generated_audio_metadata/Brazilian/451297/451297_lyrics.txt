Another day goes drifting by
Once again I close my eyes
To meet you in a corner of my mind
A place untouched by time
Where we can be like yesterday
Your whisper fills the still of night
You touch my lips I feel so light
Adrift within the fragrance of your hair
So soft and fine, I'd swear
We're making love like yesterday
Shadows blooming in the night
You move inside my soul and linger with the new light
Then I'm sure that all the years, all the laughter and the tears
Still hold a place inside your heart
We'll never be apart
You're here with me like yesterday
Shadows blooming in the night
You move inside my soul
And linger with the new light
Then I'm sure that all the years
All the laughter and the tears
Still hold a place inside your heart
We'll never be apart
You're here with me
Like yesterday
