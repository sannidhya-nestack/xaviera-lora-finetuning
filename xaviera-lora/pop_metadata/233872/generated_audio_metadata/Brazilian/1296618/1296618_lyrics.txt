Breezy nights on sandy shores
A melody that softly did pour
Through rhythms that are ever kind
So let this tune ease your mind
Sunset paints the sky golden hue
Whispers of the wind calling you
Ocean waves in death gentle sway
Stars begin their walls come out to play
Soft guitar in hand (strawling dreams)
Clouds drift overhead (floating beams)
Footprints in the sand (a fleeting trace) (a fleeting trace)
Moonlight's tender touch (a lover's grace)
Hearts in sync tonight, lead as one
Serenade, the night has begun
Embrace the simple joy that we seek
Find solace in this song, unique
Candles flicker low (casting light)
Shadow puppets play in the night (in the night)
After fills the air (your delight)
Setched in time (all them times)
Time will let them flow (never knew)
Memories we keep oh so deep (wander with the waves)
