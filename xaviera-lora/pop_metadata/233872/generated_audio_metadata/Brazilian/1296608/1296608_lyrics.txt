Under the moon's gentle glow by the sea
Let's explore our dream together
Waves whispering sweet secrets on the shore, on the shore
Soft breeze waves the palm trees lightly dance
Moonlight kisses our worries away
Hunting bright, shining bright
We lose ourselves in this moment forevermore
Stars shine like diamonds above
Twinkling grace, twinkling grace
Sand between our toes
Walking slow
Oceans lullaby in the night soothing tones, ooh
Hearts beating in perfect time, pure embrace
Hold me close and never let go
In this love
In this moonlit paradise heaven found
Every step we take feels so right
Serenade you and I
Dancing in the night
Timeless sound
Dreams drift on ocean waves
Floating free, hooting free
Your eyes are a sea of stars
Deep and true
Laughter blends with the crashing surf, your delight, ooh
Love's melody plays on and on, me and you
Hold me close and never let go
In this love
In this moonlit paradise, heaven found
Hidden found
Every step we take feels so right
Serenade you and I
Dancing in the night
Timeless sound
