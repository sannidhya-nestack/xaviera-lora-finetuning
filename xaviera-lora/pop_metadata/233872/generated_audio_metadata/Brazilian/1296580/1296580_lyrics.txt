Underneath the sun's warm glow
Feel the rhythm soft and slow
Let the melodies take hold
In this place where stories unfold
Dancing toes upon the sand, wave to the sky
Palm trees swaying hand in hand, whispering why
Warm nights, cool drinks, scenery, stars in your eyes
Moonlight stories, hearts will teach, timeless surprise
Whispers float on summer's air, secrets we share
Gentle breezes through your hair, a tender care
Sunset colors paint the sky all over sight
Dreams take flight and hearts will try to say goodbye
Ocean waves that kiss the shore forevermore
Laughter echoes wanting more
Our spirits soar
