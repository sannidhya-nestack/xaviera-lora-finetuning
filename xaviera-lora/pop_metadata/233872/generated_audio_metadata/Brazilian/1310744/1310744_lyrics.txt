Sunrise whispers over waves
City wakes and surfers crave
Cafe buzz and samba sway
Copacabana calls the day
Sidewalk sings in black and white
Sea breeze dances day to night
Guitars strum and voices blend
Copacabana never ends
Copacabana dreams all day
Copacabana come what may
Copacabana hearts will play
Copacabana every way
Neon lights and twilight glow
Lovers stroll and soft winds blow
Laughter peaks and glasses chime
Copacabana out of time
Copacabana, dreams all day
Copacabana, come what may
Copacabana, hearts will play
Copacabana, everywhere
