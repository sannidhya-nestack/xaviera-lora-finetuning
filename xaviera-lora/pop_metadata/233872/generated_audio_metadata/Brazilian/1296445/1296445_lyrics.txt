Under the sheen of the stars
A melody weaves through the air
Soft whispers of the moonlight
You breathe in slow, gentle tide
As shadows grow, hearts collide
Candles aglow
Dreams come fire
In mood soft flow
Lovers glide
The ocean sighs
Midnight's blue
With lullabies
Songs of you
In your eyes
Truths are true
Still unknown
We move in time, midnight's blue
With lullabies, songs of you
In your eyes, truths are true
Still unknown skies, love anew
We move in time, whisper sweet
Your hand in mine
Hearts will meet
Worlds intertwine
Rhythms greet
Bound by design
Lost heartbeat
Bare feet on sand
Soft embrace
Under this bed
Starry space
We understand
In this place, love's silent strand
Lower in base, the night grows deep
Secrets told, in dreams we keep
Memories bold, on our hearts leap
Rich in gold, forever safe
