Come dance with me
Come dance the samba
Rumba salsa marumba and cha cha
Come play with me
Come play bossa nova
Marimba, clava, timbala and candela
Come and dance, come and romance
Come and dance, come and romance
Come and dance, come and romance
You can always go there
A place you know where
Your dreams await there
You can build a treehouse in your mind
Come sing with me
Come sing a samba
Got over its sensitive and it's burning man
Come dance with me
Come dance the samba
Rumba salsa mamba and shasha
Come and dance, come and romance
Come and dance, come and romance
Come and dance, come and romance
You can always go there
A place you know where
Your dreams await there
You can build a treehouse in your mind
