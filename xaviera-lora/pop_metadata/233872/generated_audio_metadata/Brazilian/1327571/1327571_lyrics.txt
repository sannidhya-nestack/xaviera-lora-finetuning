If you question my affection, honey, don't
If you're thinking'bout leaving, honey, don't
If you're having second thoughts about me loving you
Honey don't if it's the last thing you do
you're the first thing I reach for every morning
The second I open my eyes
If you doubt the love that surrounds you
When my arms are around you
Honey, don't
If it's the last thing you do
If you're wondering if I'm straying
Honey, don't
If you believe I'd be that foolish, honey, don't
If you think I'd take a chance, that could lead to losing you, honey, don't
If it's the last thing you do
'Cause you're the first thing I reach for every morning
The second I open my eyes
If you doubt the love that's around you
When my arms are around you
Honey, don't if it's the last thing you do
If you're having second thoughts about me loving you
Honey, don't if it's the last thing you do
