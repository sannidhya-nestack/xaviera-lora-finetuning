Whistlers in the quiet room
Tender like the night's bloom
Moonlight dances on your face
Lost in the timeless chase
Hearts that beat in perfect time
Every touch a soft rhyme
Morning sun through windows glass
Love that time will never pass
Two souls in an endless flow, where the rivers calm and slow
In your eyes, eternity, love's sweet endless melody
Sparsity
