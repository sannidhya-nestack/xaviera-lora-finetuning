Let the rhythm sweep you off your feet
Whispers in the breeze carry you to me
Underneath the moonlight, golden dreams
Softly dancing shadows, this night gleams
Gentle whispers calling from the sea
This night we're floating, wild and free
Stars are gently glowing, tin and metal
Melodies are flowing through the night
With your hand in mine dear (holding tight)
Lost within this moment in the light
Stars are gently glowing (dim and bright)
Melodies are flowing (through the night)
With your hand in mine dear (holding tight)
Lost within this moment in time
I hear the waves they're singing soft and sweet
Feel the hearts they're ringing when we meet
Every step a heartbeat close in time
Lost within this moment in the light
Constant still we're drifting soft and sweet
In the notes we're lifting silent rhythm
Lost in our own rhythm
Untold dream in the night of magic, moonlit scheme
Ocean breezes whispering (tales so grand)
In this world of wonders (hand in hand)
Every song a promise (made to keep)
In the embrace of twilight (falling deeply)
