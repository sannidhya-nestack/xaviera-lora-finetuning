Underneath the moonlit sky we find a rhythm
The gentle sway of time, let's dance, feel the beat
Let's dive into the melody, so tender, sweep me away
Bossa Nova carries us like whispers, soft and sweet
Ocean whispers calling softly, dance with me
Every breeze it hums a tune, gentle sway
Night time colors paint the shoreline, twilight glow
This is where our hearts find magic, lost in time
Stars above they guide our footsteps, shining bright
Every step a gentle story told with grace
Feel the warmth of moonlit samba
Wrap me close in the night
Our love's unfolding, just you and me
Whispering wave of endless passion
Hold me tight, echoes of the night surrounding
Breathe it in
Together we are like the ocean deep and wide
Flowing through this endless summer by your side
Nights embrace a tender moment
Lingering every beat
A shared caress, soft silk
In this dance we lose our worries
Fade away, nothing else can touch
This feeling here with you
Morning comes but you'll remember
Swaying still, every step
A timeless memory, dense glow
Even though the night is ending
Stay with me, in our hearts the rhythm lingers forevermore
