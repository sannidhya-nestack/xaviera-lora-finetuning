In the gentle sway of moonlit nights
We find our hearts in the rhythm of Rion
Sunset whispers, carnival dreams
Samba beats in the night
Waves caress, sand so fine
Rios call, hear it sing
Coffee scents
Morning breeze
Golden street
Suns embrace
Laughter echoes
Children play
Lovers dance
In the shade
City lights
Sparkle bright
Stars align
Whispered of moonlit sea
Kiss the shore
Lights a song
We all know
Jazz guitars softly strum
Quiet whisper in the crowd
Hearts entwined beats as one
Rio dreams call aloud
Culture rich has unfolded
Secret past stories told
Morning light ends our night still
