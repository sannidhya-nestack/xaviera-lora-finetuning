Let the gentle rhythms sway your heart
Whispers of a breeze tell our story
A dance of love beneath the stars in the quiet night
We find our glory
Walking on the shore at midnight
Soft rhythms
Moonlight paints our shadows long
Silver light
Hand in hand we face the waves the waves song
Listening to the sea sweet song
Whispered dream
Walking on the shore at midnight
Soft rhythms
Moonlight paints our shadows long
Silver light
Hand in hand we face the waves the waves
Listening to the sea, sweet song
Whispered dreams, stars above
They seem to wink, little secret
As we dance bare feet in the sand
Every step, all laughter fills the cool night air
Joyful echo, hearts aligned they understand
Silently, oh the moon smiling down
Pure enchantment
Every moment feels so right
Timeless dance
Hold me close don't let me go
Tender whisper
In this night our hearts take flight
Boundless sky
Ebb and flow the ocean's kiss
Endless dance
Your eyes reflect the starry night
Shimmering pool
Promises in every glance
Wordless vows
In love's embrace it feels so right
Serenade
Morning comes but still we sway
Golden hue
Tall bricks with a gentle sigh
Sweet drop in the light
Our dreams will stay forevermore
Caught up in this boss I
Endless loop
And slow
