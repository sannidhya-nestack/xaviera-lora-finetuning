In the moonlit forest near the coast
We find the rhythms that we love the most
With gentle breezes whispering through
Let this music carry you
Beneath the starlit canopy (silver light)
We dance to melodies so free (hymn of life)
Soft samba in the air we breathe (gentle sway)
A serenade beneath the trees (where we play)
Footsteps on a sandy shore (broader's kiss)
Ripples reach our hearts once more (endless bliss)
Our laughter echoes through the breeze (saccharine)
In moments like these, we see (happiness)
With every beat, the world slows down (timeless song)
Our feet imprint on sacred ground (where we belong)
We paint the sky with every sound
Colors bright in this enchanted space we're found
Shards of light
Whispers of the ocean deep in night blue
Memories and dreams we keep always new
Gentle waves a lullaby
Oceans hem, lost in time as hours fly
Light goes dim, through the forest trails we roam
Roam our path, nature sings a soothing poem
Song that our hearts align with every chord
Hearts unite, this magic our spirits soar
Let's fly
Footsteps on a sandy shore (water's kiss)
Ripples reach our hearts once more (endless bliss)
Our laughter echoes through the breeze (soft caress)
In moments like these
