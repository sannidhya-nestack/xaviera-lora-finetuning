When the night falls softly on the bay
And the whispers of the waves contemplate
We find our element, the moonlight's glow
In a dance of words that we don't know
Whispered dreams beneath the starry sky
Dreams untold
Soft guitar that plays as time flies (time goes)
Every breath you take feels like a sigh (breath of fire)
In this endless night where love resides (hearts aspire)
Midnight kisses by the ocean's edge (sweet and pure)
Love unfolding like a tender pledge (calm and sure)
As the moonlight dances on the tide, silver gleam
We find solace in the night we buy, shared dream
Your eyes glisten like the stars above, shining bright
In this melody we call our love, endless life
We sway together in this gentle tune, soft caress
Underneath the watchful silver moon ignites the nest
The breeze carries whispers soft and low, secrets told
In your arms I find my sweetest glow, break the mold
This embrace that fills my soul with light, hold me near
In the quiet of this tranquil night, nothing to fear
Footsteps in the sand that mark our way (paths we choose)
Memories in the night, soft ballet (memories)
Every touch a promise we create (pure delight)
In this bossa nova love so great (endless fight)
