Under the twilight sky
Where shadows softly sway
Let's take a moment
To breathe in the music of the night
We walk along the shore (silver seashells)
Your hand pressed in mine, warm and gentle
The stars whisper above, cosmic secrets
As waves kiss the sand, eternal dance
Your laughter like a song
Easy melody
Echoes in the breeze
Soft and tender
We dance under the moon
Silently lost in the moment
Timeless affair
Feel the heartbeat of the night
Slowly pulsing
In this tranquil dream, serene haven
We float on whispers, grossly whispers
In the cool embrace, sweet surrender
Your eyes like midnight pool, deep and endless
Draw me in so close, magnetic pool
The world fades away, gentle haze
We exist in silence, shared heartbeat
The dawn begins to break, fragile promise
Sunlight on your face, molten glow
We hold on to the night, fleeting moment
The morning mist, soft caprice
