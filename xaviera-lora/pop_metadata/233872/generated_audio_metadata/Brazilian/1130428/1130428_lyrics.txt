Mama, I said, my job's killing me
I just want to be free
Is there no hope, you see
I've been working so long
Feels like I don't belong
But I make such good money
I guess I should feel lucky
She said, so lucky
She said, so lucky
She said, so lucky
She said so lucky, she said so lucky
Mama I said we just bought a chalet
Been repairing for days I can't fix my malaise
First I'm working all week then repairing I'm weak
But I own two nice places I guess I should feel lucky
She said so lucky, she said so lucky
She said, "So lucky"
She said, "So lucky"
She said, "So lucky"
How could I be so lucky? How could I be so lucky?
How could I be so lucky? How could I be so lucky?
How could I be so lucky? How could I been so lucky?
How could I been so lucky? How could I been so lucky?
Mama, I said, I've been cutting up trees
Splitting, stacking all these
I am weak in the knees
Sixty hours a week
Twenty more on the weekend
But the trees are on my land
I guess I should feel lucky
She said so lucky
She said so lucky
She said so lucky
She said so lucky
Mama I said my wife's driving me crazy
And my kid is so lazy
Now my mind's getting hazy
Seems my life is all work
And I'm feeling berserk
But I have a healthy family
I guess I should feel lucky
She said so lucky
She said so lucky, she said so lucky, she said so lucky
How could I be so lucky? How could I be so lucky?
How could I be so lucky? How could I be so lucky?
How could I be so lucky? How could I been so lucky?
How could I be so lucky? How could I've been so lucky?
So lucky
