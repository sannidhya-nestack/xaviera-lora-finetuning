Hey there, there's something in the water
The sea's getting cleaner with this marvelous sunlight
Hey there, those fishes going faster
And I am getting cleaner but the real wash is inside
Swimming under the sea
Struggle is over
Only tranquility
Beautiful moments
Hey there
Not taking any picture
But I'm sure I can fix it easily into my mind
Hey there, variety of colors
I see where mother nature beckoned her first word for life
Swimming under the sea
Struggle is over
Only tranquility
Beautiful moments
Inside my head
There are only muffled sounds
Inside my head
In my heart and all around
Swimming under the sea
Struggle is over
Only tranquility
Beautiful moments
Under the sea
Under the sea, under the sea, under the sea
