A miserable moonlight while shadows dance
A spiral story with heavy glass
A boss hungover to steal the night
New whispers found in the tender light
Walking down the beach under stars
Footsteps in the sand leaving scars (how they heal)
Listening to waves in our heart (ocean seal)
Feeling every beat as it starts (perfect steel)
Candles in the dark flicker slow (gentle breath)
Holding hands so tight we both know
Trust grows deep
Jazz notes play a soft amber glow
Timelessly
Whisper to the wind let love flow
Secrets keep
Candles in the dark flicker slow
Gentle breath
Holding hands so tight we both know
Trust grows deep
Jazz notes play a soft amber glow
Timelessly
Whisper to the wind let love flow
Secrets key in my walls
It's just you and me, endless night
Dancing to a silent melody, out of sight
Every step a timeless memory, pure delight
Underneath the sky so calmly, shining bright
City lights reflect in your eyes, I'm in bliss
Traffic hums our evening lullabies, girl and me
Whispered words become our sweet sky
Secret friend caught up in your delicate ties
Loving it
Time stops when you're near
Lost in you
Moments pulling us so dear
Feels so true
Whispers in my ears so clear
Heart to melodies that we all hear
Breaking through
Candles in the dark flicker slow (gentle breath)
Holding hands so tight we both know (trust grows deep)
Jazz notes play a soft ember glow (timelessly)
Whisper to the wind let love flow (secrets key)
Candles in the dark flicker slow (gentle breath)
Holding hands so tight we both know (trust grows deep)
Jazz notes play a soft ember glow (timelessly)
Whisper to the wind let love flow
Secrets key
Midnight wants it's just you and me (endless night)
Dancing to a silent melody (out of sight)
Every step a timeless memory (hear the light underneath the sky)
