A melody winds through the twilight
A rhythm that's soft and so right
Beneath the stars we sway and dance
In a moonlit dress
Whispers on a warm breeze (sweet serenade)
Underneath the palm trees (shade of jade)
Gentle waves that kiss the shore (less time)
Heartbeats asking for more (deep inside)
Eyes that shine like distant stars (distant stars)
Dreams as soft as sweet guitar (the key to my heart)
Lips the taste of midnight wine (so divine)
Moments frozen in time
You are mine
Footsteps that go on the sand (hand in hand)
To a drumbeat oh so grand (beats command)
Candles flicker in the dark (tiny spark)
Love igniting a spark (from the heart)
Eyes that shine like distant stars (sun and stars)
Dreams as soft as sweet guitar (jewelry far)
Lips that taste of midnight wine (so divine)
Moments frozen in time, you are mine
Footsteps echo on the sand (hand in hand)
To a drum the old soul crashed (crashed)
Candles flicker in the dark (tiny spark)
Love igniting a spark from the heart
Eyes that shine like distant stars (light as stars)
Dreams as soft as sweet guitar (geophars)
Lips that taste of midnight wine (so divine)
Moments frozen in time
You are mine
We'll dance until the dawn (daylight's young)
Lost in each other's song (where we belong)
In this rhythm we reside (our hearts collide)
Together forever entwined (love divine)
Now I will dance until the dawn (daylight's young) (daylight's young)
Lost in each other's song (where we belong)
In this rhythm, we reside (our skies)
Together forever entwined (in love with love we find)
