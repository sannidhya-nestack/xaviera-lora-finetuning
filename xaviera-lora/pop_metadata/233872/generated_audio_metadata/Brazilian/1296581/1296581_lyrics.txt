As the sun looks below the horizon, the rhythm of the night digs over
Don't fight a need to lose yourself in its whispers, let the sound of bossa nova be your guide
Moonlight dances on the way (to you, just wait)
City lights like fireflies and stars
Breathing in the midnight air, embrace
Whispers float on summer's breeze, silent tales
Fingers strumming stories told, pain goes past
Timeless secrets from the string (beating songs)
Footsteps tracing sandy shore (born that song)
Nights embrace a tender home (velvet heart)
Stars above weave lullabies (tie in tunes)
Hearts in sync with oceans hum (Living pulse)
Dreams arise from twilight's clues (Nighttime blues)
In this moment we become (Endless fry)
Whispered words under the moon (Soft confide)
Echoes linger in the dark, fading glow
Every note a fleeting kiss, sweet caress
Hold on tight to what you find, cherish now
Gentle waves carry us home, peaceful drift
Shadows dance on starlit dreams (low and slayed)
Melodies in every sight (sight of breath)
