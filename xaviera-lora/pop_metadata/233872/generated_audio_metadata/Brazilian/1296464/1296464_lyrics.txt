Beneath the scent of glow, will the ocean breeze flow?
A summer dream begins with a gentle rhythm so slow, oh
In the early morning light, the spurs of dawn
Shadows start to dance, first steps are drawn
Lovers in the sand, echoes of a song
Holding hands so tight, never alone
In the early morning lights (send on)
Shadows start to dance (this lips are drawn)
Lovers in the sand (echoes of a song)
Holding hands so tight, never wrong
Seagulls sing their tune (a call from above)
Feet sink into the dune (tides of love)
Palm trees sway and groom, a touch so soft
Always and too soon, like dreams aloft
Waves kiss the shore, endless embrace
Hearts longing for more, tides of love
Palm trees swaying, moonlight time grace
Found what we, we adore, timeless space
Moonlight paints the sky, silvery beams
Reflections in our eyes
Moving dreams
A night that slowly fly
Gentle streams
Till the sunrise cries
Morning's gleam
Whisper secrets low into the night
Feel the moments grow
Hearts take flight
Every breeze we know holding tight
As the night winds blow stars inside
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
