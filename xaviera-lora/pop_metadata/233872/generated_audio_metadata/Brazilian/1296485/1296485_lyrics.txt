Kick off your shoes and let the ribbon guide you
We'll glide through the summer with a gentle sway
Sunrise kissing the horizon
Warm breeze whispering secrets softly now
Ocean waves playing our melody, nature's tune
Palm trees dancing in unison, don't you see
Let's take a summertime stroll (feel it too)
Every step a simple bliss (step by step)
Hand in hand we'll find the way (follow me)
In this laid back, solid day (so free)
Golden sands beneath our feet (Golden touch)
Seabirds painting stories high (Fly away)
Seashells tell their ancient tales (Still)
They sing smiles shared without a word
Just a glass moonlight whisper sweet nothing
After dark stars aligning in our favor
Heaven's sign
Waves caress the shore in rhythm
Gentle touch
Hearts united in the night
Two as one
Let's take a summertime stroll
Feel it too
