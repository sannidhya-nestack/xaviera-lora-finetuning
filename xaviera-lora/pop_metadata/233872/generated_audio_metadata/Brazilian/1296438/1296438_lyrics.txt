Under the stars we sway
With the moon above us smiling
Let the rhythm take us away
In this night so giggly
In a dance of dreams we go (hearts entwined)
With every step we flow (holy grace)
Leaps in the night below (silently)
Whisper secret songs that grow (calling me)
Through the air we glide and spawn (oh no)
Feel the gentle warmth of sun (golden light)
Every move a story spun (time was tuned)
Guided by the night undone (harvest moon)
We move in shadows here (realistic trace)
In the silence feel (a light to grace)
Every beat is something new (heaven's key)
In the moment it's just you, only me
Gentle breezes tease the night (a joyful scheme)
Fills our hearts with pure delight (a perfect dream)
In the starlight's tender light (at the sky)
