Underneath the moon's soft glow, where the timeless breezes flow. In your eyes a story told, love that never will grow. By the sea where dreams unfold, holding hands as tales of gold.
Every touch a sweet caress
In your arms I find my rest
Time stands still when hearts align
In your love my soul will shine
Eternal whispers in the air
With you there's nothing to compare
Dancing shadows on the sand
In our world a love so grand
Even if the stars collide
We will face the endless tide
Gentle waves kiss every shore
Moments with you I adore
