Sail this way with the setting sun
Softly echo rhythms of long lost joy
In the corner of your mind's delight
Let the whispers in the breeze take flight
Moonlight swims across the ocean
Lonely hearts find fleeting devotion
Garden blooms in quiet motion
Dreams unfold like secret potion
Kisses fall
Like summer rain (vision too gray)
Every touch a sweet refrain (and then break)
Hands that seek in twilight's veins (intertwine)
Love's a dance that leaves no stain (design)
Twilight's glow paints shadows gold (silent heart)
Writin' stories now
Music drifts through open hands (so pure)
Whispers soft as woven hair (the love's aligning)
Scars aligning
And whispered to silently
Footsteps walked beneath the moon
Fade of breeze
Hearts aligned in night's caress
With a beat
Dance with love and nothing left
Feeling sweet
Kisses fall like summer rain
Every touch a sweet refrain (and pray)
Hands that seek in twilight's vein (intertwine)
Love's a dance that leaves no stain (by design)
