Whispering waves on midnight shore
Your hand in mine forevermore
Timeless sparkles in your eyes
Underneath the velvet skies
Gentle breath of morning breeze
With you life's sweetest melodies
In the glow of dawn we stand
Eclipsed by love so grand
Eternal flame in endless night
Two hearts aligned, a timeless flight
Through ages past and years to come
Our love will ever gently hum
Underneath the old oak tree
We carve our names in history
A hidden poem in the stars
Bound together near and far
Faded prints on the golden sand
Stories told through lovers' hands
Echoes of our silent vow
Living in the here and now
Eternal flame in endless night
Two hearts aligned
