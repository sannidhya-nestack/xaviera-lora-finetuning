In the quiet of the moonlight
Serenade of stars above
Whispers in the gentle night
We dance in timeless love
Waves that kiss the sandy shore
Echoes of our hearts that beat
In a world that craves for more
We find a love that's sweet
Timeless rhythm hold me tight
In your arms the world's so light
Every moment feels so right
With you love is pure delight
Through the seasons we will go
Hand in hand we'll always grow
In the rain or in the snow
Our love will ever flow
Years may come and years may fade
Still our hearts will never part
In this dance that we have made
We sing with one true heart
Timeless rhythm hold me tight
In your arms the world's so light
Every moment feels so right
