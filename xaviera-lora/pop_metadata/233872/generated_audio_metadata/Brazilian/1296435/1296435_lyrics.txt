In the heart of the lazy afternoon
Where melodies dance with the breeze
We find our thoughts wandering
In a space between dreams
Starlit skies, whisper tunes, soft glow
The sun dips low, too soon golden hour
The waves touch the moon (sell her kiss)
Hearts in sweet swoon (gentle sigh)
We sway in times
Embrace slow walls
Moments endless
Gracefully in dream
In your eyes I find my place
Deep blue
My soul begins to trace
Love in gaze
Palm trees hum their song
Leafy choir, sand warms where we belong
Silky touch, birds join the throngs
Seven way love keeps us strong
Timeless bond
Dreams weave through the day
Drowsing light, thoughts like clouds
Play with reprieve, hands softly stay
Touch so light in a world of shadows gray
We sway in times, embrace slow walls
For moments, endless grace, fleeting dream
In your eyes I find my place, deep blue
My soul begins to trace, loving gaze
