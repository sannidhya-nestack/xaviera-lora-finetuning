In time, melodies like salt and lime
Worth the sunshine fills the air
Lovers dance without a care
Softly treading on the sand (magical land)
Golden rays in your hand (understand)
Every whisper says your name (the midnight flame)
Hearts ignite like a spark (the dark)
Waves that kiss the moon at shore (forevermore)
Rhythms touch as we dive (and feel alive)
In this moment we thrive (alive)
In the night we hear the sea (melody)
Stars above set us free (floating free)
Echoes play through the night
Holding on to what's true (me and you)
Dancing under twilight skies (in this paradise)
Staring deep into your eyes (no disguise)
Every note of Sweden brings (a house or a place)
In this dance we are one
