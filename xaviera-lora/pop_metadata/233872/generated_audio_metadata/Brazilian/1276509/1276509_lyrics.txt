In the gentle sway of twilight
Where the sun meets the sea
Whispers of a tender night
Dance around you and me
Oh, the stars they softly shimmer
Casting dreams upon the sand
Heartbeats echo in the glimmer
As we waltz hand in hand
Feel the warm breeze on the ocean
Carrying a melody
Every note a sweet emotion playing our symphony
Oh the stars they softly shimmer casting dreams upon the sand
Heartbeats echo in the glimmer as we waltz hand in hand
In this moment time is fleeting
Yet it feels infinite
Every heartbeat gently meeting
Where are souls quiet?
