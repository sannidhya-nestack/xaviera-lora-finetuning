Lights down low and the rhythm flows
Feel the sway like the crescent glow
Every step brings us closer to
In the night under stars anew
Whispered secrets sure would be soft drops
In the air a gentle tea (warm breeze)
Hold me tight never let me go (capture time)
In this dance where the love will grow (spark, spark)
See the waves crashing on the shore (moonlight)
Every heartbeat craving more (endless night)
Eyes like oceans pull me in (deep dive)
Rhythms play on our skin (the light)
Underneath the sequined sky (deepened dive)
Turning shadows, dancing above (soft drive)
Feel the magic in the night (fell with you)
Each moment feels so right in here
Stars are winking overhead, cosmic tips
Every movement words unsaid, silent lips
Touch so tender hold so true, gentle grasp
In this moment it's me and you, hearts clasped
Mirrored souls in the silver light, king flame
Twirl me round, hold me tight (sweet game)
Lost in time, no need to part (endless ways)
Feel the rhythm of the heart (we crave)
Mirrored souls in the silver light (me)
Twirl me round, hold me tight (sweet game)
Lost in time, no need to part (endless ways)
Feel the rhythm of the heart (we crave)
