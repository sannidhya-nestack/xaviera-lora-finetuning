Feel the warm breeze on your face
Let the jitter take its place
In this song a dream will float
With each line a clever note
Walking on the golden sand (tonight and day)
Hand in hand let's understand (as a place)
The world explore the land (lands of play)
Bright horizons looking grand (freeway)
Whispers in the salted air (secrets told)
Sparkling stars they're everywhere (right and bold)
In our souls we feel the flames (heavens unfold)
Every moment we can spare (the reason why)
Underneath the frangy trees (gentle sway)
We can let our worries be (night and day)
Feel the softness of the day
The winds and clouds will never see us free (goin' astray)
Listen to the ocean's sonority
Every note just feels so strong in me
In these waves we do belong and need
Let's ride it out all night long, energy
Laughter echoes in the night, a delight
Like casting silver light, a sight
Love will make our spirits brown and tight
Everything just feels so right, this flight
Whispers in the salted air, secrets told
Twinkling stars they're everywhere, bright and bold
In our souls we feel the flare, dreams unfold
Every moment we can spare
Our ears are once in need of fun, gently tuned
Gentle sway and let our worries be
Night and day, feel the softness of the breeze
Things unclear and you'll never see us through
But it straightens into the evening
Ocean solid deep
Every note just feels so strong on me
In these waves we do belong
You and me
Let's ride it out all night long energy
Listen to the ocean solid deep
Every note just feels so strong on me
In these waves we do belong
You and me
Let's ride it out all night long energy
