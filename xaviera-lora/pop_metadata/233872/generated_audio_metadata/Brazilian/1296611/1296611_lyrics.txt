Feel the warm breeze on your skin as we wander by the shore
Let the rhythm of the waves carry us to a world where time stands still
This is our moment wrapped in the music of summer
The sun dips low in the sky (golden glow)
Dance in the sand so free (toes in the snow)
Whispers of love in your ear (cover me)
Moments that last forever (we're together)
Soft shadows kiss the palm tree (gentle squeeze)
Capturing each tender glance (once on the trance)
And laughter drifts on the night's breeze (but deep)
Holding you close in a trance (sweet dance)
Under the stars we sway (night's ballet)
Fingers entwined so tight (moonlight)
Dreaming of endless days (bright rain)
Making memories tonight (pure delight)
Every wave tells a story (your story)
Our hearts beat in time as one (never done)
Promises held in silence (soft bound)
Love song has just begun (never run)
Sparkling eyes meet mine (so divine)
Sips of sweet summer wine (so fine)
Lost in this perfect drive (no time)
Echoes of this sweet night (just right)
Sparkling eyes meet mine
