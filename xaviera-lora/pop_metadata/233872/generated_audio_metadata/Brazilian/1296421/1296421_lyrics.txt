In the sway of the night, where whispers float like dreams
Let the coins of our hearts, twine and silk in the seams
Stars whisper gentle secrets, shimmering tonight
Moonlight paints your silhouette
Silver in the light
Waves caress the sandy shores
A tender lullaby
Your smile steals my breath away
The oceans reply
Breezes weave through our laughter
Caught in the breeze
Palm trees sway with the rhythm
Dancing in the tease
Harmony of our footsteps
A symphony of two
Every moment feels timeless
Eternity's here
Love blooms under night skies
A blossom so rare
Echoes of our whispers
Floating through the air
Music of the cosmos
Twinkling in our ears
Together we are weightless
Absent of all fear, sunrise finds us dreaming
Wrapped in dawn's embrace, birdsong serenade the morn
A chorus full of grace, shadows slowly retreating
Vanishing from sight, new day gently touches us
Cloaked in morning light
In the cradle of your arms
My refuge in heaven
Magic of this night remains
Forever I'm shaken
Timeless is our melody
Etched in our souls
Our hearts beat in harmony
Making us whole
Breezes weave through our laughter
Caught in the breeze
Palm trees sway with the rhythm
Dancing in the tease
Harmony of our footsteps
A symphony of two
Every moment feels timeless
The eternity's here
Love blooms under night skies (but blossoms so rare)
Echoes of our whispers (floating through the air)
Music of the cosmos (twinkling in our ears)
Together we are weightless
Absent of all fears, sunrise finds us dreaming
Wrapped in dawn's embrace, birdsong serenade the morn
A chorus full of grace, shadows slowly retreating
Vanishing from sight, new day gently touches us
Cloaked in morning light
In the cradle of your arms, my refuge in heaven
Magic of this night remains forever unshaken
Timeless is our melody
