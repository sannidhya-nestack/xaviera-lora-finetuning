The sun dips low in the ocean's glow
The waves hum soft as the breezes flow
Mountains rise like a dream so near
Ryo's heartbeat's clear and sincere
Golden lights paint the sky tonight
City dances in the soft moonlight
Every corner sings a sweet refrain
Rio's beauty flows in everything
Cobblestones hold stories untold
Laughter lingers where the drinks are cold
Sunbow whispers through the warm night air
Rio's rhythm is beyond compare
Golden lights paint the sky tonight
City dances in the soft moonlight
Every corner sings a sweet refrain
Rio's beauty flows in every vein
The hills embrace the city's face
In every shadow there's a trace of joy and light
A fleeting song in Rio's arms where we belong
Indians aren't where we belong
