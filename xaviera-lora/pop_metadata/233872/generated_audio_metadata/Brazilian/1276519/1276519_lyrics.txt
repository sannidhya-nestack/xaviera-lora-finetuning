Underneath the gentle sway, where the ocean meets the day
Soft whispers of a breeze, dance through the sunlit trees
In the rhythm of the night, stars are singing, shining bright
Feet in sand, we find our way
Through the colors of the bay
Oh, the moonlight serenade
Plays a tune that never fades
In this moment here with you
Time is but a dream come true
Every note, a sweet caress, a melody of tenderness
Hands entwined, we walk on air, lost in magic everywhere
Feel the waves embrace so long, gentle as a soothing song
Heart to heart like endless streams
Floating softly in our dreams
Oh, the moonlight serenade
Plays a tune that never fades
In this moment here with you
Time is but a dream come true
Let the waves embrace so long
Gentle as a soothing song
Heart to heart like endless streams
Floating softly in our dreams
Oh, the moonlight serenade
Plays a tune that never fades
In this moment here with you
Time is but a dream come true
Let the night enfold us tight until we fade into the light
Whisper secrets sweet and low where the ocean breezes blow
And as the dawn begins to glow hold me close and don't let go
In the rhythm of our hearts forever never feels apart
