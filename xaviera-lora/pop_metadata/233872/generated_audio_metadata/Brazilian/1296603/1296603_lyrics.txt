Hail snow keep our in the valiant skies
Stories are whispered and dreams come alive
Strolling through the night (let the soft glow)
Hear the distant waves (let the endless glow)
Candles flicker bright (candle shadows)
Serenading light, hearts and echoes
Sipping on this wine, crimson velvet
Eyes that lock with mine, don't you et
Dance with every light, sunken sunset
Moments intertwined, as we do it
Whispers in the air, gentle breezes
Movements right with care, you can't tease it
Magic everywhere, soul in each
Laments intertwine as we do it
Whispers in the air, gentle breezes
Movements sway with care, time to tease it
Magic everywhere, soul releases
Lost inside your stare, endless pieces
Melodies so sweet like a secret
Rhythms in our feet, hearts can't be set
Life's a rhythmic beat, times are faded
In this cozy seat where we do it
Stars above so bright (rose of the night)
Holding on so tight (not a taste for it)
Dreams will soon ignite (you're the light)
Everything feels right (so bright)
Whispers in the air (Gentle three sets)
Movements sway with care (Competition)
Magic everywhere (It's over the sets)
Lost inside your stare (Fantastic set)
Melodies so sweet (Like a secret rhythm)
