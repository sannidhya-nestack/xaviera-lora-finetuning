When the world whispers, sloshes and snores, they'll dance in the light of the moon, where hearts find their chance
I hear your laughter falling (night)
Sunbeams gently falling (around)
Your eyes tell a story (of otten dreams)
In the night's embrace (with)
Your voice is the love (of distant)
And this is our return
Hearts in hearts that soar in dreams
Shadows play in the hush of night
Real voice is the rhythm of a distant shore
Promises are written in hearts that soar
Underneath the palm trees where our shadows play
In the hush of night we will find our way
When light walks in slowly I'll see a grand place
Whispers echo sweetly our tender memories
Stars will guide our dance as we float on air
In the heart of night we become the air
Every step we take to a timeless tune
Every glance we make under a silver moon
Hold me ever closer in this fleeting time
Feel our hearts in sync in a lost pure line
Let's sail on the whispers of a dream untold
Sharing secret glances in a world of ours
