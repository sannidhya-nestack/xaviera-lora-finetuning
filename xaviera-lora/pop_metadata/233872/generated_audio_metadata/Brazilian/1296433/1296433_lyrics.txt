Gentle storms under moonlight skies
The air which brews secrets in disguise
Dancing shadows weave fleeting tales
Embrace the rhythm, let it unveil
Silent waves kissing sandy shores (whispers low)
Stars above like open doors (hearts aglow)
Breezes hung in harmony (softly flow)
Every step a sweet decree (don't let garden booms)
With whispered vow (petals fall)
Fingers trace the night's soft bow (love's sweet call)
Brandles flicker in the dark (gentle flame)
Eyes that meet and sparks embark (name the game)
Let's get lost in Twilight's song (endless night)
Where we belong, silver moon
Hearts entwined with every beast playing swoon
Footprints linger down the street, midnight groom
Footsteps dance on cobblestones, timeless walls
Waves that crash, a parting tone, nature's fall
Embers glow in fireplace, warmth inside
With every smile there's a tray cannot hide
Moments blend with starry skies, distant dreams
Echoes of our laughter rise, so it seems
In the stillness hearts connect, night serene
Every glance a chance perfect, love unseen
Garden blooms with whispered vows
Petals fall, fingers trace the night's soft bows
Love's sweet call, candles flicker in the dark
Gentle flame, eyes that meet in sparks embark
Name a tune
Let's get lost with whispered vow
Petals fall
Fingers trace the night's soft bone
Love's sweet call
Candles flicker in the dark
Gentle flame
Eyes that meet and sparks embark
Name the game
Let's get lost in twilight song
Endless tune
Feel the night where we belong
Silver moon
Hearts entwined with every beat
Sway and swoon
Footprints linger down the street
