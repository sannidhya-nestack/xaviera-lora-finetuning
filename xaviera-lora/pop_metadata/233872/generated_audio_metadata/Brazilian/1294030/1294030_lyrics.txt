R-do-be-da-da-da-ba-ba-da-ba-da
R'dupi d'akta t'ipu piliha
Wifare, that's seeking in wonder
Don't awake, that deeds are bad matter
Soare, a tent that is sheer
Kikirvaryol, a town with foreign land
Don't want no skin, we sewed the middle
There's a work in it that might
We're sewing, make me feel your session
Let's not worry, kid, it's every mile
Before I erase, detail me, cause me
Tomo ue dan tozoku to
Soando ue baku to ue ue ue ue
But she is just being a fun girl moro
Inuandosuke ue soko ue ue ue
Girezu ue kei ue to dan mai
We slowly make me feel your session
That's unknown, we can't step, we might
Sorry, we didn't conceive me
Don't worry, turn away, now you don't
We'll fall away, we'll see who has your mind
Show me da da da do do do do do do do da da da da do do do do do do da da da do do do do do da
