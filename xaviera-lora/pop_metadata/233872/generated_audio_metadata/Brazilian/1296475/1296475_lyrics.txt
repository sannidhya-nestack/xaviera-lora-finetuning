Poor couple lets we can feel the day
Sweet aroma dances in dawn's play
Step by step life starts to sway
In the morning light we find our way
Coffee in the morning, wake up call
Sunrise through the window, golden fall
Stirring dreams and cream, caffeine steam
Whispering good vibes, hopes redeemed
Bittersweet sensation (white steel light)
Calm and warm embrace (day's first light)
Moments treasured tight (what means grace)
Every single drop (no haste)
Serenade of coffee (silent tune)
Brewing joy and laughter (after you)
Filling hearts with cheer (perfect start)
In this daily ritual art
Mug against my lips (gentle kiss)
Morning's gentle hug
Blissful twist
Lost in liquid warmth
Dreams revealed
Every sip, a story
Healed
Good against my lips
Gentle kiss
Morning's gentle hug
Blissful twist
Lost in liquid warmth
Dreams revealed
Every sip, a story
Healed
Bittersweet sensation, white still life
Calm and warm embrace, day's first light
Moments treasured tight, morning's grace
