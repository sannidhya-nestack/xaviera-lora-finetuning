Under the Rio sky, the breeze is warm and soft
We sway and twilight glow, lost in the night's embrace
In a world of whispered dreams, dancing by sky
Our hearts play the melody, summer's sigh
With every step we take (with a policy)
You move as one, just you and me (no perfect time)
Moonlit serenade we hum, glowing moonbeam
Wrapped in love's tender notes, soft velvet sky
As waves kiss the sandy shore, timeless in grace
Our souls sway in the night, eternal walls
Through the samba of our lives (sleep steps so high)
We find the garden of the life (roses in bloom)
Underneath the canopy (our dream place now)
We waltz in harmony (our last duet)
Moonlit serenade we hum (glowing in the evening)
Wrapped in love's tender nose
Above the velvet sky
As waves kiss the sandy shore
To timeless embrace
Our souls sway in the night (eternal waltz)
The night whispers our secrets (winds of the south)
As we drift into our dreams (eyes close tight)
In the arms of destiny (filled by faith)
We dance until the dawn breaks (day begins)
