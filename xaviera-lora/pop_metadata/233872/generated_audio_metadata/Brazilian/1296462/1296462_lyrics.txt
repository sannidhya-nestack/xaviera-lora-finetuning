Golden skies shouting over the bay
Whispers of the ocean night in the day
Footprints on the shore fading away
Dreams in the breeze dance as we sway
Waves kissing sand gentle and slow
Moonlight paints a silver glow
Stars align and bring her show
Heartbeats echo as feelings grow
Underneath the twilight, soft and warm
Silence serenades in nature's form
In the sweet moon, hearts embalmed
We'll chase the horizon, calm in the storm
Our lovers to lay soft and clear
Shazzy rhythms, we hold it
In every note, wipe away the tear
In every chord, drumming in
Palm trees sway into heartbeat
Echoes of laughter on repeat
Lost in the melody
Oh, so sweet
Where love and music always meet
Underneath the twilight, soft and warm
Silence serenades in nature's form
In this sweet moment, hearts and bones
Will chase the horizon, calm in the storm
