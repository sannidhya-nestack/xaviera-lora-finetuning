Let the waves of the movies sweep through like a summer breeze
Feel the rhythm of your feet, lose yourself in these blessed dreams
Under moonlight where shadows meet
Stars above sing a quiet beat
Winds of change brush against our skin
Dancing slow while the world spins
Shoes off running in the sand
Hand in hand like a perfect plan
Golden moments in the sun
Endless days, laughing loud like we're still young
Timeless thoughts, hold me close, let the music flow
Endless times, swaying softly as candles glow
Leave me alone, locked together heart to heart
Be this show, just sing the song of who we are
Silent soul, every touch a sweet embrace
Every smile lights up your face
Lost in rhythm, lost in time
Loss of dreams become the rhyme
As the night folds into dawn
Our steps trace a path long gone
Dreams awaken with each tune
In this moment under the moon
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
As the night folds into dawn
Our steps trace a path long gone
Dreams awaken with each tune
In this moment under the moon
No night where shadows meet
Stars above sing a quiet beat
Dreams awaken with each tune
In this moment under the moon
As the night folds into dawn
Our steps trace a path long gone
Dreams awaken with each tune
