As the sun dips low and the moon starts to glow
We let our worries go and let the rhythm flow
City lights start to gleam (there's a star)
In the twilight like a dream (socket top)
And the ocean's gentle sigh brings a tear to my eye
Underneath the seaside palms (light and shade)
We find solace and some calm (every sway)
In the breeze that gently twirls,'cross the sand it swirls
Hold me close under the stars, feel the rhythm from afar
Let the night steal our fears
We'll et the world's tears (lust and praise)
In the shadows hearts align (in the clouds)
Two souls perfectly in time (in the clouds)
With each whisper of the night (tender hug)
Every moment feels so right
As the dawn begins to stir
Golden rays we just left to gleam
Holding on to what we found
As delight
In this paradise unbound
Pure delight
