As the ship pulls out to sea
All on board and anchors free
We start our voyage cruising the world
Seeing the wonderful sights unfold
There are bars on every floor
Lots of great shops to explore
See the great theater for all the shows
Swimming pools where the
Cool water flows
I love cruising round the world
All the thrilling sights to see
You can see any great place
Lots of exciting dreams to chase
As we duck in the next bay
We all explore for the day
As the guests sightsee all the beautiful sights
Then back on board for relaxing nights
You can drink and admire the view
Where sea and sky are blue
You may see dolphins swimming past
It's paradise which will always last
I love cruising round the world
All the thrilling sights to see
You can see any great place
Lots of exciting dreams to chase
