The sun is melting on the waves
As shadows dance beneath the ponds
A gentle breeze makes hearts behave
In rhythms soft and soothing calm
Moonlit sands hold hands in dreams
Stars align in cosmic beams
Waves are humming nature's rhymes
Lost in time we chase the signs
Twilight's glow embraces night
At first paint the skies alight
Footprints vanish with the tide
Memories in shells reside
Hearts entwine where breezes play
Every note a lullaby
Palm leaves dance a secret way
In the night we'll gently sway
Underneath this endless sky
Fingers trace the stars on high
Laughter of the elusive breeze
Fills the air with timeless seeds of smiles
As dawn breaks and night retreats (Morning)
New life fills the sands we meet (Morning)
Cherish every fleeting beat (Morning)
In our souls this dance repeats (This chorus)
As dawn breaks and night retreats (morning)
New light fills the sands we meet (rolling)
Cherish every fleeting beat (our thrill)
In our souls this dance repeats (endless chories)
