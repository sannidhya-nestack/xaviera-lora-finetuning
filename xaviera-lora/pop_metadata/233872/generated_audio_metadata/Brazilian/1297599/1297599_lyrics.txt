Under mullet skies we softly tread
Whispers of love like leaves freshly shed
Time stands still as hearts quietly blend
In each other's arms until the very end
Stars we count like dreams we've spun
Together we dance'til the morning sun
Life's a melody we both compose
In your embrace
My garden grows
Timeless love in every heartbeat's call
With you it feels like we have it all
No clock can fade what's etched so deep
In your eyes the promises we keep
Eons pass by in a blink of an eye
With you beside I'm ready to fly
Seasons may change but feelings remain
Timeless love flows in every vein
When shadows fall and nights are long
We'll entwine in an ancient song
Our love's a story the winds will tell
Of two souls who knew each other well
Timeless love in every heartbeat's call
With you it feels like we have it all
No clock can fade what's etched so deep
In your eyes the promises we keep
