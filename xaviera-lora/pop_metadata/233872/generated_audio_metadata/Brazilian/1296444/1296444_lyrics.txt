In the gentle sway of moonlit nights
We find a rhythm that lives in our hearts
A dance of whispers and soft melodies
Let this be our serenade
Starlit skies above the beach, I go painting
Whispered secrets to the night, soft and fleeting
Every step in perfect time, slow and steady
Underneath the silver light, moons embrace
Jazz tunes flowing through the air (sweet melody)
Whispered secrets to the night, soft and pleading
Every step in perfect time, slow and spooky
Underneath the silver light, moons embrace
Jazz tunes flowing through the air (sweet and mellow)
Captured moments in a gaze (this sparkle)
Echoes of a yesterday (go snogging in)
In the heartbeat of the waves (on this journey)
Feel the warm embrace of night (tender soft)
Passa Nova in the breeze (gentle swift)
Every note a souvenir
Precious memory in the twilight's gentle tease, soft caress
Sparks ignite in moonlit hues, radiant glow
Laughter echoes in the dark, joyous echoes
Lingered in a sweet perfume
Whispering tossed in time without a mark, endless now
Shadows dance on sandy shores (silent walls)
Drifting on a velvet dream (soft obsession)
Melodies that drift away (fading whisper)
In a tender lover's theme (endless lover's hymn)
Feel the warm embrace of night (tender sigh)
Bossa nova in the breeze (gentle sway)
Every note a souvenir (precious memory)
In the twilight's gentle tease (saccharine)
Feel the warm embrace of night (tender sigh?)
Bossa nova in the breeze (gentle sway)
Every note a souvenir (precious memory)
In the twilight's gentle tease (saccharine)
Sparks ignite in moonlight hues, radiant glow
Laughter echoes in the dark, joyous echoes
