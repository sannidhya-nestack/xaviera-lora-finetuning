Sway with the ocean's gentle breeze
Underneath the starlit sky
Whispers of melodies sit in the trees
Like a peaceful lullaby
In this moment let the world drift by
Holding hands we start to fly
With every note we rise above
Dancing softly with our love
Moonlight paints the shore with grace
Soft shadows kiss the sand
Feel the rhythm in this place
As we move heart to hand
Time suspends in the night's embrace
Lost in the warmth we find
Step by step, a tender trace
A harmony of heart and mind
In this moment let the world drift by
Holding hands we start to fly
