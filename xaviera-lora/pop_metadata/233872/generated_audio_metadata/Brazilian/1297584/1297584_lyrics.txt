Under the starlit sky your eyes glow so bright
We sway like whispers in the quiet night
Eternity's a word we both know by heart
In your arms I found my place, my start
Together through ages we dance to the breeze
Every second with you puts my soul at ease
Time's but an illusion when I'm holding your hand
With every heartbeat you make me understand
Timeless love, this feeling won't expire
Burning deep within like an eternal fire
In your gaze, all worries fade away
Forever in your love, I long to stay
Moments etched in gold, memories unfurl
With you by my side, I conquer the world
No distance, no time can tear us apart
For your love is the song that beats in my heart
In the silence, we find stories to tell
Every glance we share casts a magic spell
As the moonlight dances upon me
