Under a twilight whispers, where time softly drifts
We find melodies in the night, dancing on gentle breezes
Join me in this serenade, where each note holds its own secret
Where each lyric is a gentle caress
Inviting us to lose ourselves in the rhythm of the stars
Starlit dreams awaken gentle sigh
Echoes of the ocean in night blue
Whispering soft secrets (silver glow)
Moonlight on the treetops (salsa flow)
Breezy palms are swaying (soft caress)
Hearts are intertwined (silent beat)
Underneath the heaven-less night dance
Symphonies of stardust, whispered heat
Catch the rhythm slowly, timeless sway
Feel the night embrace hearts delight
Every step a memory, soft elation
We're lost in the moment, endless night
Starry-eyed illusions (dreams of fire)
Footprints on the shoreline (tentile trace)
Melodies enchanting (moonlit rays)
Echoes of pure longing (skies of light)
