We sway under stuff (covered in dread)
Whispers ride the breeze (a movement dead)
Hands meet in rhythm (a fleeting trance)
Our souls take flight (a timeless romance)
Laughter echoes near
The night's embrace
Footsteps brush the sand
Our private space
Eyes meet with meaning
I see your face
Hearts beat together
A gentle trace
Underneath the glow
The world is still
Words fall soft and slow
A silent thrift
Every move we make
Time stands at will
Dancing in the dark
A night's sweet spin
Candles flicker close
In whispered line
Moments we compose
Within our sight
Linger on your lips
A tender bite
Captured in this spell
The stars delight
We et the dawn
Lost in a dream
Bare toes in the sand
A golden gleam
Ocean's lulling song
A soothing breeze
Symphony of love, our secret's key
We et the dawn
Lost in a dream, bare toes in the sand
A golden gleam, oceans love
