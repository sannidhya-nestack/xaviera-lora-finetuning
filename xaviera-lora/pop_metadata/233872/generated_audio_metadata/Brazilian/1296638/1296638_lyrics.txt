Under the glow of starlight
Where the nights are endless and bright
We sway to the rhythm of our hearts
Beneath the sun, the moon
In the quiet of the night (soft whisper)
Dreams take their flight (endless sky)
With every step we dance (lost in trends)
Hand in hand we don't ask why (timeless ties)
In the quiet of the night (soft)
Whisper, dreams take their flight
In the sky, with every step we dance
Lost in trend, hand in hand we don't ask why
Timeless tide, shadows play on the sand
Dancing light, your touch feels so grand
Electric side, moments flowing like wine
So divine, here with you I feel alright
Perfect night
Hearts beating as one, rhythmic song together holding on, ever strong
No fears can find us here, love so clear, our love drifts on and off, forever long
Sunrise hints at the end
Morning blend
Still your love I defend
Never bend
In the dawn I love the pier
Chasing fear
Fading lights of what we've been
Breezy years
So let's write our own tune
Heaven's blue
Dance until the afternoon
Lazy do
In a world just me and you
Ever true
Underneath the summer moon
Love cocoon
Saw those play on the sand (dancing light)
Your touch feels so grand (electric sign)
Moments flowing like wine (so divine)
Here with you I feel alright (perfect night)
Hearts beating as one (life makes song)
Together holding on (ever strong)
No fears can find us here (love so clear)
Our love drifts on and on (forever love)
