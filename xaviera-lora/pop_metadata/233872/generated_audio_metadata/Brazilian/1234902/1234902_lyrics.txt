You brought me light
You scared of all the shadows
No more fight or flight
We are someplace nobody knows of
I burst in flames
When your voice hits from a distance
Let's play this game
I call it disobedience
Make me do it baby
You have to find me first
Do I owe you one?
Come and take it
Make me do it baby
You have to find me first
Do I owe you one?
Come and take it
Don't overthink
You're ready
Show them all
Faster
Don't overthink
Get ready
Show them all
(Get ready)
(Shut up)
Faster
Don't overthink
Get ready
You brought me light
You scared of all the shadows
No more fight or flight
We are some place nobody knows of
I burst in flames
When your voice hits from a distance
Let's play this game
I call it disobedience
Make me do it baby, you have to find me first, do I owe you one? Come and take it
Faster
Don't overthink
Get ready
Show them all
