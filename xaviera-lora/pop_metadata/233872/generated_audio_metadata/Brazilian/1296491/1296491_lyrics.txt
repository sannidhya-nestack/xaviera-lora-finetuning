Gentle breeze is coming to us twilight paints the afternoon
Sunset colors on your face gold and glow
Whisper secrets in the lace soft and slow
Every word we can't erase time will show
Dancing shadows find their place undertow
Ocean's rhythm meets our feet, cool and calm
Heartbeats mix with every beat, a perfect song
Mystery and love complete in my palm
Moments breathless and discreet, scent of balm
In the moonlight's tender grip, silver drift
Every single touch a script, summer myth
Together we let our hearts slip
Then knock you through the night, our spirits lift, swift uplift
Stars above like gods, they gleam, glowing light
Dreams afloat, always a dream take flight
Life together like a stream, pure delight
Endless whispers, soft scream through the night
Echoes in meaning air, gentle kiss
Lovers dance without a care, timeless bliss
Fingers interlace and share nothingness
In this love we both declare, serenades twist
In the moonlight's tender grip, silver drift
Every single touch a script
Summer lift
Together we let our hearts slip
In my breath
Through the night our spirits lift
Swift uplift
In the moonlight's tender grip
Silver drift
Every single touch a script
Summer lift
Together we let our hearts slip
Gentle gift
Through the night our spirits lift
Swift uplift
Stars above like dives they gleam, glowing light
Dreams afloat on waves of dream take flight
Life together like a stream, pure delight
Endless whispers, soft scream through the night
Through the night
Through the night
Do you avoid asking that you're right?
Truth will not raise a dream to light
