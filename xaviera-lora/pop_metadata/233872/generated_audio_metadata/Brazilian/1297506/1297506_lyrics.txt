While the stars do their slow dance
In the sky they find romance
You and I like timeless waves
Wash ashore on gold
Golden days, whisper secrets soft and sweet
Where the ocean meets the street
Hands entwined like roots in earth
Blooming love for all its worth
Timeless hearts in gentle sway
Painting dreams in the light of day
Side by side we find our place
In each other, an endless embrace
Underneath the moon's soft glow
We'll let all our feelings flow
Silent moments speak so much
In a world that needs no crutch
With each breath we share a world
Where love's story is unfurled
Every glance, a brush of fate, written in stars that can't abate
As the night turns into dawn, love's sweet melody is drawn
In the echo of our sighs, time stands still and never plays
