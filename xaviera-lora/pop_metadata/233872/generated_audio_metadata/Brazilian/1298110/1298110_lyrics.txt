Under moonlight skies we dance so slow
Whispered secrets only stars will know
In your eyes I see the endless sea
Timeless love in every breath we breathe
Softly spinning tales of love and night
Silhouettes that fade with morning light
Every moment feels like whispered dreams
In your arms, eternity, it seems
Timeless love, a gentle breeze we share
Echoes of our heartbeats fill the air
Every kiss, a poem softly told
In your warmth I'll never feel the cold
Crystal waves on shores of golden sand
Hand in hand we walk this endless land
Though the years may change the world we see
Timeless love is you and you are me
Raindrops play a symphony so sweet
Pavement glistens where our hearts do meet
Through the seasons we will always grow
Timeless love in moonlit afterglow
Timeless love that you love
