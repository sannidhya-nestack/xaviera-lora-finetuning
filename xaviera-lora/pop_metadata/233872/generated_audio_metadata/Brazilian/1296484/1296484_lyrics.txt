Settling by the shore, the sun melts into gold
Waves whisper secrets as stories unfold
Stars, all a twinkle (it's canvas)
Moons, gentle wink (soft drink)
Oceans, hum soothing (serenade)
Hearts swaying slow (gentle beat)
Palm trees are dancing (winds caress)
Footsteps on sand (echoes past)
Whispers of lovers (timeless kiss)
Memories made forever last
Warm breeze is calling tender voice
Eyes meet and smile in silence
She hands intertwined moments
Lost in the now holding deep
Sunrise will paint (morning's breath)
Hues of the dawn (new story)
Seashells reveal (hidden truth)
Forever embraced (endless glow)
More breezes calling (tender voice)
Eyes meet and smile (silent shield)
Hands intertwined
Moments lost in the now holding deep
Whoa, hoping dear
Sunrise will paint morning's breath
Hues of the dawn, new stories
Seashells reveal hidden truth
Forever embrace endless glory
Morning breeze is calling, tender voice
