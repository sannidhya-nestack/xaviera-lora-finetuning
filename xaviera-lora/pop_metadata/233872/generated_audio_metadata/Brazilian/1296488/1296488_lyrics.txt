Let the rhythm guide you now
Feel the sway, let feelings grow
Stars are twinkling in the sky
Gentle whispers pass us by
Dreams are drifting to the night
Feeling waves of pure delight
Moonlight dances on the sea
Footsteps follow endlessly
Hands entwined with fingers warm
Never straight up calm and storm
Oh, the music in the air
Sings a song beyond compare
Melodies that touch the soul
Feel the change in this dance
We feel whole, rearrange
The silent messages we send
Understood every breath and
Feel so good, rhythms echoed
Rhythms echoed deep inside
Close your eyes in this moment
Whispers in the breeze tonight
Holding on with all our might
Disappear in this gentle lover's song
Find the tune we can dance the whole night long to the moon
Silent messages we sent
Understood every breath and
Every breath and every bend
Feels so good when Gantz so could
Rhythms echo deep inside
Close your eyes in this moment
Summer's whispers in the breeze tonight hold
Too near
Holding on with all our might disappear
In this gentle lover's song, find the tune
We can dance the whole night long
