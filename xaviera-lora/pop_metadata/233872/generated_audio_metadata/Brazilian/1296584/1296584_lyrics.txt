Walk out this way of dreams
Where the sun meets the streams
Let the waves wash over you
In rhythms soft and true
Sipping coffee in the morning (friends, hugs)
Gentle breeze, a perfect fall (whispers)
Dozens send their hearts reborn (tides recede)
In this place where love is sworn (arms are free)
Ocean whispers secrets deep (shells will tell)
Promises we long to hear (gray sky)
Every note so crystal clear (breeze will sing)
In a world that's drawing me (sweet dream)
Underneath the twilight sky (the stars awake)
Holding close you and I
Tangle every sigh and every cry
In perfect time we fly
Moonlit ties they kiss the shore (light embrace)
Footprints lost forevermore (passing)
Songs that drift to hearts so sure (mellow)
Mysteries we can't ignore (lines released)
