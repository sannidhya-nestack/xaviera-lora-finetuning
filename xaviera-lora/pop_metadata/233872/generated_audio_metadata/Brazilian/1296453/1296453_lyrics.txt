The soft waves whispering secrets at twilight
Sun-dipped skies paint the horizon with dreams
Let's get lost in the rhythm of the night
We'll dance on the shore bathed in moonbeams
Walking on the sand so free
Time stands still
Stars above are all we see
Night so chill
Whisper to the breeze with me
Your voice thrills
In this moment we are free
Let's just feel
Twilight kisses on your face
Are too nice
Dancing in this sacred space
Feels so right
Hands entwined in sweet embrace
Warm delight
We'll remember this pure grace
Under moonlight
Ocean songs so soft and sweet
Endless dreams
Feel the rhythm in our feet
So serene
Every heartbeat is a beat
