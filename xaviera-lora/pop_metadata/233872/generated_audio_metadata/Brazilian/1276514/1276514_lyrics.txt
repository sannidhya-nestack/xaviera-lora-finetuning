In a gentle sway of the nighttime breeze
Whispers blend with the rustling trees
Moonlight dances on the ocean's crest
As we find our way to a starry rest
Underneath the velvet sky
Moments linger softly sigh
In the rhythm of the sea
You and I so free
The footsteps trace the sandy shore
Echoes of a love that we both adore
Every wave recites a secret tale
Of distant shores where lovers sail
Underneath the velvet sky
Moments linger softly sigh
In the rhythm of the sea
You and I so free
Feel the warmth of the ocean's kiss
Here in our secluded bliss
Every heartbeat keeps the time
In this timeless summer rhyme
In the gentle sway of the night
