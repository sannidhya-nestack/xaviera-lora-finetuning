And all tea and sweet harmony
And all to grace the lamb
But I'll say "grace" until she knows
Sinners
Nice to go, I only know my love
Blue to the sea and calm, calm and sad
In the morning sun
I'll rocket the blue inside
To be in pocket of your love
Yes, you know my love
Only sweet but strange surprise
And maybe courteous kiss
Don't you know my love?
Only free and brutal way
Strangers, neighbours, life, don't you know my love?
Outside my door, you come, smile and pick a pocket
Oh my love, oh you know my love
I'll cage the blue inside
And pick a pocket of my love
I'll pick a pocket of my love
I'll pick a pocket of my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
