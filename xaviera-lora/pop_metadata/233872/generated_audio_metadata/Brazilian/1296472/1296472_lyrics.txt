Hook a gentle sway at the tide
Under the moon's soft glowing light
Let's embark on a journey tonight
Where melodies and whispers collide
Starlit skies whisper secrets softly they glow
Tunes of hearts in the night let them show
Footsteps trace a shadowy dance
Slowly they go
Dreams take flight in the breeze
Excellently flow
Whispers of ocean waves calling us near
Magic in the moonbeam (crystal clear)
Hands entwine in rhythm spell (happy to feel)
Love beneath the starlight (all is here)
Palm trees sway with the wind
Gentle they sway
Echoes of the night song lost in play
Every breath a promise made
Words we say
Moments in the bossa
We relive the day
