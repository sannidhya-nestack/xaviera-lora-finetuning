Moonlight spills on the old stone street
Whispers dance where lovers meet
The night hums with a sweet refrain
Echoes of your name in the rain
Stars twinkle like our secret sign
Your eyes shimmer in dreamy lines
A guitar strums close and slow
In rhythm with hearts that know
Nocturna, Bella, you and I
Underneath the velvet sky
Lost in moments that feel so free
Just the moon, the stars, and we
