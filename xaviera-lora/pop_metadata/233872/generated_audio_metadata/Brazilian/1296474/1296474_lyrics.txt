Let's drift away to where the sun kisses the sea
Where the rhythm of life gently sways like a breeze
Close your eyes and let the music take you there
Feel the warmth of Rio in every note
Whispered tales of love under moonlit skies
Gentle waves that soothe with a soft surprise
Footsteps on the sand
Echo hearts reply
Stars that light the way
As dreams amplify
Breezes through the palms
Sing a sweet refrain
Lovers dance to time
Never feeling pain
Colors paint the air
In a soft ballet
Moments linger long
Night turns to day
Breezes through the palms
Sing a sweet refrain
Lovers dance to time
Never feeling pain
Colors paint the air
In a soft ballet
Moments linger long
Night turns to day
Breezes through the pop
Songs that never end
Lovers dance to tang
Lover feeling pain
Moments linger long
Moments linger long
Night turns to day, songs that never end
In a tender glow
I'm sorry, soft and bland
I live the mellow flow
I'm hearts in harmony
I'm finding where to go
I'm shores of silent peace
On the ocean tides
