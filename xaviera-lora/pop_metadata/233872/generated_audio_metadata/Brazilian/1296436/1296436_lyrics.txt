When the night falls in Rio
And the stars start to glow
Whisper to the breeze
Let the rhythm take control
Moonlight on the bay (glowing in the light)
Dancing shadows play (underneath the night)
Soft whispers in the trees (calling out my name)
Echo through the sea (memories like the same)
Steps upon the sand (memories unfold)
Hand in lonely hand, stories left untold
Follow where it leads, to a hidden shore
Heart that gently pleads, always wanting more
Sweet serenade begins, melody of dreams
Gentle as the wind, flowing like the streams
Lost in your soft gaze, like a secret song
Moments that are made, where we both belong
Stars that paint the sky, dancing in the blue
Dreams that drift on by, holding on to you
Mystery of night (waiting to be found)
Love that feels so right (spinning us around)
Hold me in the dark (stay with me tonight)
Listen to the lark (until morning's light)
Let's not let it end (it's magical refrain)
Echoes in the bed (the sweet gentle pain)
