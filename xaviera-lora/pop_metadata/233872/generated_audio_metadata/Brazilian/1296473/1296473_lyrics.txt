Under the rain I'll sigh when I meet stormy stories
We sway to gentle beats and whispers
Where waves kiss the sand with rhythm unfolding
And this city's so alive and dreamy, ever enchanting
Walking down the old stone streets in sunlight
Feeling like a secret is told in whispers
Every breeze carries a melody like music
Every moment is gold and bold forever
Cafes hum with the heartbeats so lively
Guitar strings sing stories old, timeless
Laughter's like a waterfall, refreshing
And love is quietly bold, unspoken
Meet me where the palm trees dance so freely
Where the day meets night in a trance, we're rising
We'll write our names in the sand, permanently
And let the world take its chance, fearlessly
Stars begin their lazy descent
So softly
Listen to the city's scent
Sweetly
Holding hands in the twilight
Tender
Everything feels perfectly right
Tonight, meet me where the palm trees stand so free
Where the day meets night in a dress, my rising
We'll write our names in the sand, permanently
And let the world take its chance, fearlessly
