Lay back, relax and feel the breeze
Let's drift away on melodies
With every word and every note
We'll sail away like a dreaming boat
Golden sunset over oceans
Blue-winged whispers, secrets that I never knew (sad and true)
Like kisses on the shifting sand (can't talk to)
Write our story with a loving hand (much too much)
Crickets chirping in a serenading choir
The stars are glowing in a sweet parade
I am one
Swaying softly to the night's embracing light
Heartbeats echo in this timeless play
I feel so alive
Driftings chirping in a serenading choir
The stars are glowing in a sweet parade
The rain (I don't want it)
Sweating softly to the night's embrace (I'm singing a lie)
Heartbeats echo in this timeless place (I feel so rough)
Drifting slowly on a velvet sea (I'm feeling calm)
Carving moments of serenity (Sweet as Boston)
Rhythms of a bossa to my new crew
Wrapped in magic'neath a silver moon
Lazy breezes in the twilight air (whisper of love)
Lingering touches full of tender care
Salvation waves are calling us to distant shores (in their plea)
In your arms forever I'll adorn (set me free)
Drifting slowly on a velvet sea (moon and calm)
Carving moments of serenity
