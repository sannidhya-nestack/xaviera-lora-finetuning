The poor soul set sighing by a sicker martyr
Sing willow, willow, willow
And on her blossom heard a lullaby
Sing willow, willow, willow
Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee
Sing willow, willow, willow
The fresh dreams run by her and
Murmured her mourns
Sing willow, willow, willow
Her salt is filled from her winds
Of tender stones
Sing willow, willow, willow
Her salt is filled from her winds
Of tender stones
Sing willow, willow, willow
I called my love false love, but what said he then?
Sing willow, willow, willow
If I court more women, you couch with more men
Sing willow
Willow, willow
If I court more women you'll couch with more men
Sing willow, willow, willow
