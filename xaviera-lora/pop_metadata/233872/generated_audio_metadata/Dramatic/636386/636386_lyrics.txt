To me
Born each moment, new from mystery, The paradigms play with fire and ice, Inspired to deed as though by voices.
Urged to make my passions fever deep
Crave comfort from seasons plenty turned
One the brave called chaos and mistress
Born we the flesh blood of our dead kin
Renew we the soul blood of our gods
It does draft things drawn from many realms
