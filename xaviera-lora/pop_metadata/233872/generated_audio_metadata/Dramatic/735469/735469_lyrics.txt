(Ooooh)
You were the man, the man for me
Without your love I was incomplete
You moved the ground below my feet
The time with you felt warm and sweet
We had a steering life since I met you
And everything seemed simple and true
You stole my heart and broke it too
What have I done? Don't have a clue
I am living after my death, after my death
I can see you after my death, after my death
No joy, no dreams, nowhere, still there
No love, no hope, my heart
I am leaving after my death, after my death
I can see you after my death, after my death
The thunder's roar, you went away
I kept myself full of the day
Now love light shines for you and her
You little felons, you won't get away
We had a steering life since I met you
And everything seemed simple and true
You stole my heart and broke it too
What have I done? Don't have a clue
I am living after my death, after my death
I can see you after my death, after my death
No joy, no dreams, nowhere, still there
No love, no hope, my heart so cold
I am leaving
After my death, after my death
I can see you
After my death, after my death
