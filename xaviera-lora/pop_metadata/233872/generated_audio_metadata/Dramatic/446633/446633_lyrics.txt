Another winter here will I survive
Lying on my bed alone again tonight
This place it haunts me another sleepless night
Then I see a star fall through the city lights that burn so bright
Are you an angel or is this by chance I don't know
You make me see this place in a different light, different glow
This is the first time here that I don't feel alone
You make this place feel like home
Look on the bright side, a better point of view
Follow your dreams and they will come true
I've never seen so many colors shining through
Make anything into a good thing that's all you can do
Are you an angel or is this by chance I don't know
You make me see this place in a different light, a different glow
This is the first time here that I don't feel alone
You made this place feel like home
You made this place feel like home
How I found you I'll never know
You make this place feel like home
You make this place feel like home
Are you an angel or is this by chance I don't know
You make me see this place in a different light, a different glow
This is the first time here that I don't feel alone
You make this place feel like home
