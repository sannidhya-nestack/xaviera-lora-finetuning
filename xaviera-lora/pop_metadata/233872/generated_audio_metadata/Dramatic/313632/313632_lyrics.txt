I'm in sunshine
I'm in sunshine
Going to the places that I love
Under a blue, devon sky
Where dolphins come into play
You watch the clouds passing by
Going to the places that I love
Under a blue, devon sky
Where dolphins come into play
You watch the clouds passing by
Found in the sunshine
Out in sunshine, flowing to the places that I love
Under a blue, devon sky
Where dolphins come into play
You watch the clouds passing by
Going to the places that I love
Under a blue, deepened sky
Where dolphins come into play
You watch the clouds passing by
Burnin' sunshine
Burnin' sunshine
[HUMMING]
And every time I leave
A part of me stays here
Again a brighter day
And you know it feels so good
Found in the sunshine
Found in the sunshine
Found in the sunshine
Burning sunshine
Found in sunshine
