She had my heart on a lovely September day
She had my heart but we've gone our separate ways
See I know there's this feeling of emptiness inside
See I know because I've written
One hundred love lullabies, oh, oh, oh
She had my heart wrapped in her little hands
Where did she go with my heart? I don't understand
See I knew that this love was too good to be true
How could I fall in love with you?
You
How could I ever fall in love with
You
