As I lie here all by myself
Who is to blame nobody else
This is my time I wish it weren't so
I know deep down I'm not ready to go
And I'm lonely
Nobody knows me
And I ain't ever coming home
Never coming home
And I'm scared
Nobody cares
And I ain't ever coming home
Never coming home
There's so many things I should have done
I don't even have a wife, daughter or son
A girl said to me I should never have came
It's ironic now that I feel the same
I wish I was there
Where they care
And I ain't ever coming home
I'm never coming home
I won't lie
I don't wanna die
And I ain't ever coming home
Never coming home
And mother I never told you how much I love you
And father I didn't really believe I was above you
There are so many issues I will never mend
Now it hurts me so I'll never see you again
And I'm scared
I always cared
But I ain't ever coming home
I'm never coming home
So don't cry
It's goodbye
And I ain't ever coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
