Did I ever told you that your smell is in my mind
Have you ever looked into my eyes and saw the love
Have you ever looked into my eyes and saw the love
Did I ever told you that your smell is in my mind
Ooh, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ooh
Your kisses make me feel so high
Did you ever heard my heart is beating just for you
Did I ever told you that your smell is in my mind
You know that I love you, you know that I need you
You are the air that I breathe
Your kisses make me feel so high
Have you ever looked into my eyes and saw the love
Did I ever told you that your smell is in my mind?
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
You are the air that I breathe
Your kisses make me feel so high
Have you ever looked into my eyes and saw the love?
Did I ever told you that your smell is in my mind?
Have you ever looked into my eyes and saw that love
Did I ever told you that your smell is in my mind
Have you ever looked into my eyes and saw the love
Did I ever told you that your smell is in my mind
