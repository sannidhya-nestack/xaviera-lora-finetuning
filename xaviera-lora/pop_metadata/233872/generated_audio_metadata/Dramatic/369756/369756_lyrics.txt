Going to the places that I love
Under a blue devon sky
Where dolphins come to play
You watch the clouds passing by
You watch the clouds passing by
You watch the clouds passing by
And every time I leave
A part of me stays here
Again a brighter day
And you know it feels so good
Out in the sunshine
Down on the beach
Out in the sunshine
Easy living by the sea
Out in the sunshine
Down on the beach
Under a blue sky
Is it living by the sea?
Under a blue sky
I'm going to the places that I love
Under a blue sky
A game now brighter day
And all it feels so good
Out in the sunshine
Down on the beach
Out in the sunshine
Or is he living by the sea?
You watch the clouds passing by
Out in the sunshine
Down on your feet
Out in the sunshine
Is it living by the sea
Out in the sunshine
Down on the beach
Having sunshine
Is it living by the sea?
