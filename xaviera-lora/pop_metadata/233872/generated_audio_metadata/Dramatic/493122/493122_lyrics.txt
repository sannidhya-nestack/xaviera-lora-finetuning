Some place, some time
We'll place our hands and cry to find
Some blind face
In time erased from my mind
Some days, some time
We'll place our hands and cry together
Some blind face in time erased from my mind
Some blind face in time erased from my mind
Some place, some time
We'll place our hands and cry goodbye
Some blind faith in time erased from my mind
