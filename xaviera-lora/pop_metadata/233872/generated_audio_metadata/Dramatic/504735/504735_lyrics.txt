I know that you want to go
Want to find another place, another time
Where you're not mine, less and twice
Endless reside
But
If you take this next step in our fate
I won't bend, I won't break
I will wait if it takes
Seven loves from now
Seven loves to show you how
That I'm the one who holds and guards your heart
I will wait
Seven loves from now
