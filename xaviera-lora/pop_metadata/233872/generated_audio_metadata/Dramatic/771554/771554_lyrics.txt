Lights are out and there's sweat in your embrace
There's one other thing I dare
Lights are out and there's time to leave your faces
There is another dare
Mmm, and now the silence is too much
Mmm, and now the silence is too much
There's a lot that she's asking for
Who is it, who is it and why did you do it and what is there to it and
Maybe I blew it and who is it, who is it and why did you do it and
Maybe I blew it and what is there to it and
There's a love that she's asking for
Maybe I blew it and what is there to it and
Lights are out and there's sweat in your embrace
There's one other thing I dare
Lights are out and there's time to leave your faces
There is another dare
Mmm, and now the silence is too much
Who is it, who is it and why did you do it?
What is there to it and maybe I blew it?
Who is it, who is it and why did you do it?
Maybe I blew it and what is there to it?
There's a lot that she's asking for
Mmm, inner silence is too much
