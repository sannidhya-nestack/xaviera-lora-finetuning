Sunshine
Sunshine
And sunshine
A part of me stays here
And sunshine
And you know it feels so good
I've been the sunshine
Down on the beach
I've been the sunshine
And you know it feels so good
You watch the clouds passing by
I'm in the sunshine
Again now, brighter day out in the sunshine (sunshine, sunshine, sunshine)
A part of me stays here out in the sunshine
Down on the beach
Out in the sunshine
Easy living by the sea
Out in the sunshine
Out in the sunshine
Is it living by the sea?
Sunshine
(Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine, sunshine, sunshine, sunshine, sunshine)
