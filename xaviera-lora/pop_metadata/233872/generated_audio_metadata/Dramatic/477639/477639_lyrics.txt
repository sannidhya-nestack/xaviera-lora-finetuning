Or just be in the dark, lay your book up, your mask up, be in the dark
Or just be in the dark, lay your book down, your mask up, be in the dark
I love you, I love you, I love you more, I love you more, I love you more
Orgasm in the dark, they are gone
Orgasm in the dark
Orgasm in the dark, they are gone
Orgasm in the dark
All of us will walk in
Our lost and otten
All of us will walk in
Our lost and otten
It won't be long
For us to hold on
It won't be long
For us to hold on
