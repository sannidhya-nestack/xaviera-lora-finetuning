The less you are a lover
The less you are a lover
The closer you get, the less you see
The more you become, the more you become me
The less you are a lover, the less you are a lover
Keep your distance, stay near
Keep your distance, stay near
Keep your distance, stay near
The closer you get, the less you see
The more you become, the more you become me
The less you are a lover, the less you are a lover
Keep your distance, stay near
Keep your distance, stay near
Keep your distance, stay near
Keep your distance, stay near
Keep your distance, stay near
Keep your distance, stay near
