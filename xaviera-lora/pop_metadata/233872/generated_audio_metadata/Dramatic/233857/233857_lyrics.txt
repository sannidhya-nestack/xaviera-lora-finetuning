Thrown back on the ground of facts
Just before I fall asleep
Hidden riddles raise their voices
Memories ain't gonna fade
Shadowed by the thought of future
Swat of clouds hanging in the sky
Don't look back, don't turn around
The difference could end our love
End our love, end our love
Can't get out of where you hold on
Can't get out of where you hold on
Can't get out of where you hold on
Compose, we watch the candle burn
Attempt to walk away
To the aim of hopes and dreams
Only a passage of time
Shadowed by the thought of future
Swords of clouds hanging in the sky
Don't look back, don't turn around
The difference could end our love
Queasy feeling in pulse ahead
Getting rid of that spell
In the meantime, a clear thought
Only a passage of time
Shadows by the side of future
Swords of clouds hang in the sky
Don't look back, don't turn around
The difference could end our love
Don't look back, don't turn around
Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't turn around
Don't look back
Only a passage of time
