That seed has a dream
While falling down from way up high
Smack dab in the middle of the rainforest
It can't see through the clouds from the ground
But it will try and that seed has a dream
But it's just got to find a way
To beat the odds stacked against it
It will need lots of time
The long hard lonely journey starts today
I know it seems like it just can't be done
Keeping your head above the water
No matter how hard or painful it seems
You've got to keep pressing along
soon that storm will be gone
And you'll be free
That seed had a dream
While falling down from way up high
Now it stands as the tallest tree in the rainforest
It can feel the rays of the sun in the sky
It can feel the rays of the sun in the sky
It can feel the rays of the sun in the sky
