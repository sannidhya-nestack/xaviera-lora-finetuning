Home
In which you gonna say you're sorry
In which you wouldn't ever worry
In which you only know your own
That very home
It was like many many others
Like magic realistic sagas
It's standing on the stone alone
I know you're far from me
I know it was just a dream
I know that it was sort of
My heart is still there
At foreign-ary Luna Kodo
That was that word
That you didn't ever get to finish
And it was clearly now diminished
It was a simple little no
You're staying home
But I choose golden way of glory
You never really were to stay
When quite lonely telephone
I know you're far from me
I know it was just a dream
I know that it was sort of
Your heart is still there
At far and not real Unakodo
