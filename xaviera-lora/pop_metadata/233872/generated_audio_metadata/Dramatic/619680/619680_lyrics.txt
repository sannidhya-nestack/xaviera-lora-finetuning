I see sunshine between the dark clouds
I see sunshine between the dark clouds
Your light moving into the shadow
I see snowflakes
Oh, I see
Snowflakes behind fractal shades
A frozen heart willing
Sadness without all
I see moonlight beneath the waves, oh
I see moonlight beneath the waves
And my stint is a sea of serenity
I hear whispers beyond the stars
Fear passes only you remain
