I love this country and what it stands for
Liberty and freedom for everyone
I'm proud to be an American
Living in this great land
And I'm telling you right now
No matter what, no matter how
I'll be free any way that I can
And I will live free every day that I can
I will be free
All across the nation under a star-spangled sky
People bound for glory singing live free or die
They are proud to be Americans
Living in this great land
And I am telling you right now
No matter what, no matter how
Any way that I can
And I will live free
Every day that I can
I will be free
Yes, I will
I will be free any way that I can
And I will live free every day that I can
And I will be free any way that I can
And I will live free
Every day that I can, oh, I will be free
