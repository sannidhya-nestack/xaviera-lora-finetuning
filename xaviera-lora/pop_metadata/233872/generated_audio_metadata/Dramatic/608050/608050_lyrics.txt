Thank you for the gift of life you gave to me at birth
And thank you for the love you gave throughout your life on earth
And thank you for the family of which I am a part
In memory you'll always be
With me inside my heart
Oh, Mama, I'm not feeling any less sad
To know you're in the Father's hands
Even though I should be glad
I miss you, yes I do
But I have much to thank you for
This song is just for you
Yes, I have much to thank you for
This song is just for you
In memory you'll always be
With me inside my heart
Oh, Mama, I'm not feeling any less sad
To know you're in the Father's hands
Even though I should be glad
Mama, I miss you, yes I do
But I have much to thank you for
This song is just for you
Yes, I have much to thank you for
This song is just for you
I thank you
I thank you
This song is just for you
I thank you
