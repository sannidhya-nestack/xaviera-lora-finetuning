Yes, it's good to know you don't have to think twice
Those that came before made that sacrifice
You're free as the dawn breaks new
As the morning America, America
This is America, the land of the free
Yes it's good to know
This land's for you and me
Those that came before
Gave us our liberty
We're free
As the dawn breaks new
As the morning America
America
This is America
The land of the free
America
America
This is America, the land of the free
