Energy, energy is our own
Energy is out of bounds (energy is out of bounds)
Energy is out of bounds
Pull it (you pull it) you feel it (you feel it)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Now I'm free to break through
Fools, we drift right through
(Shush and sleep)
The strength will grow
The strength will grow
The strength
Will grow
Energy is all around
Energy is out of the ground (energy is out of the ground)
I'm falling (I'm falling) I'm feeling warm
Flip right through
Clouds of proof and drifted wreckage of you
Attractions
Synergy
Energy is out of bounds
The red, the red, the red, it's all around, it's all around
