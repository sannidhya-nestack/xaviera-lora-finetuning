I'm living in the moment
But I'm longing for the past
And passion that took over me
Yet somehow couldn't last
I feel your touch when I'm alone, when I'm alone
I hear you call my name, when you call my name
I long for you just one more night
No guilt, no harm, no blame
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Night
When I'm here
We've both moved on with someone else
And that's what we'll do
Thoughts of you, they haunt my mind
Locked deep inside of me
I see you when I close my eyes
My dreams you do live in
My days are spent without you
At night we meet again
I long for you just one more night
No guilt, no harm, no blame
I know the past has come and gone
For now, that's where you stay
But in my mind and in my heart
You're never far away
I'll never lose the memories from where we did begin
I'll never say goodbye to you until we meet again
I long for you just one more night
