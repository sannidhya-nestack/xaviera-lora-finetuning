And bend beside a man I hate
I reconcile my shameful fate
It's for my son this deed I do
And so this text I send to you
My one true love you'll always be
The center of my galaxy
My evil act results in gain
But cannot soothe this crushing pain
A devil's deal, I've made this pact
I'm in too deep, I can't turn back
A sacrifice, eternal bliss
Sealed with this unholy kiss
Sealed with this unholy kiss
My dear sweet lord, must I be damned
Now that you've seen just who I am
My one true love I have defiled
For funds to save my dying child
Devil's deal, I've made this pact
I'm in too deep, I can't turn back
I sacrifice eternal bliss
Sealed with this unholy kiss
Sealed with this unholy kiss
Ik smal om on om from bad comes good
So far beyond whether I should
When mercy has its way with us
We will return, we must
