Looking out the window she knows
Any minute he will be home
So she shuffles all the dreaming to the back of her mind
And gets ready for the nightmare that comes in after five
Gravel under tires she grows
The night begins and once more he shows
That her fist against her body surely keeps her in line
With a passage from the bible justifying his crime
I believe that the end will come today
I cannot be here with you, I wanna go away
I didn't see this coming or look the other way
And now I lay here waiting
For the daylight
Gravel under tires she grows
The night begins and once more he shows
That her fist against her body surely keeps her in line
With a passage from the bible justifying his crime
I believe in the end will come today
I cannot be here with you, I wanna go away
I didn't see this coming, or look the other way
And now I lay here waiting
And on another night, drinking, under the fucking brew she's thinking
Of what a stronger woman might have done
And would it be so bad to listen, to the wind that lately whispers
Time has come, your time has come
In the daylight
I believe that the end will come today
I will not fade away here and I hate to have to say
I smiled in my reflection as the barrel smoked away
You'll never see the daylight
There's the daylight
