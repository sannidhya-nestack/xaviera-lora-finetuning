Sophisticated, or so it seems
So frustrated, it appears to me
Trapped inside this bottle of ships
You better let them all escape
You're formidable
You'll take us all on for sure
You cause us to speak
You cause us to see
The animal in me
I've seen these dreams of you
I've seen these dreams of you
I've seen these scenes of you
I've taken sides
I've wondered how
You've seen the stars as they collide
Each time they do
They crumble like you
I've seen the signs
I've wondered how
They've seen the skies as they explode
Each time they do
They crumble like you
Like you, like you
Like you, like you
