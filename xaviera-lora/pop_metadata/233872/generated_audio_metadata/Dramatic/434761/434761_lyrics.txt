This is really an unbelievable story. It was a midsummer's night and I was, I was
It was a herringbone sky
It was a late summer's night
And I was, I was without you
And I was
Without you
It was a herringbone sky
It was a herringbone sky
There was water on the air
There was promise in your stare
But there I was without you
It was a herringbone sky
There were wings that night
There were diamond eyes at morning light
And I was, I was without you
It was a heavy moon sky
It was a late summer's night
And I was
I was without you
And I was, I was
