How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
Precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many days
Toils and snares I have already come
'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home
The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secure
He will
My shield and portion be
As long as life endures
Yeah, when this flesh and heart shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace
A life of joy and peace
