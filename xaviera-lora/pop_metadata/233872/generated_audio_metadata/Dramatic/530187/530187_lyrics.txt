Silence slips into my world
And it follows into my dreams
Moonbeams flicker across my room
And in the twilight your thoughts will be broken
And when the sun goes down
A shadow is cast on this town
And when the sun goes down
The night breaks free
Your dreams
Echo my mind's eye
In this daylight
Painting the sky
Sun comes
Crossing the water
Water, we're breathing sunlight (sunlight)
And resting our eyes
And when the sun goes down
A shadow is cast on this town
And when the sun goes down
The night breaks free
And when the sun goes down
A shadow is cast on this town
And when the sun goes down
The night breaks free
And when the sun
When the sun goes down
The shadows cast on this town
And when the sun goes down
The night breaks free
When the sun, the sun goes down
When the sun, the sun goes down
