I dreamt a dream, what can it mean?
I dreamt that I was a maiden queen
Guarded by her queen
An angel smiled, weakless, small, was never beguiled
And I wept, both night and day, and it wiped my tears away
And I wept, both day and night
And hid from him my heart's delight
Shush, shush, shush, shush, shush (Come on)
Shush (Oh my angel)
Shush (Oh) shush
Oh, my angel, go!
So he took his wings and fled
And then the morning blushed rosy red
I dried my tears
With ten thousand shields and spears
Soon my angel came again
I was armed, he came in vain
For the time of youth was fled
And grey hair were on my head
Shush, shush, shush, shush, shush (over here)
Shush, shush, shush, shush, shush (come)
Shush, shush, shush, shush, shush (oh my angel)
Oh, my angel over here comes
On tiptoes he woke up tonight
On tip wings landing in twilight
On tiptoes he woke up tonight
On tip wings landing in twilight
What it was, was it just a dream?
Was this white feather left by him?
What it was, was it just a dream?
Was this white feather left by him?
