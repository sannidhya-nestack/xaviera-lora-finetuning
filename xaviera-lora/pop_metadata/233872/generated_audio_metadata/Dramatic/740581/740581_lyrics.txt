In your name, your name, I can't et your memory of you and me, it's clear
It haunts me everyday that you're not here
Memory of you and me is clear
It haunts me everyday that you're not here

Your name, your name, I can't et your name
Your name, your name, I can't et your name
Your name, your name, I can't et your name
Your name, your name, I can't et your name
