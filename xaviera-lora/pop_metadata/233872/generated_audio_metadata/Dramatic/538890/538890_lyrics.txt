So hot
Moonlight sense of
Easy
Nowhere to go
The heat is on
We're burning up
The heat is on
We're going to cool down
We're going to take it easy
We're going to take it nice and slow
One hundred degrees
Ain't nowhere to go
The heat is on, we're burning up
The heat is on, we're going to go down
So off all that sense of
Feeling
Nowhere to go
Leave it on
We're burning up
The heat is on
Brothers go down
Gonna take it easy
Gonna take it nice and slow
One hundred degrees
I know where to go
But here you go
We're burning up nice and slow
The heat is on (the heat is on)
(Birds go down)
