(I'll be)
(by your side)
Born each moment, new from mystery to paradise, playing fire and ice. Inspired to be as though by wisdom.
Urged to make by passions fever deep
Crave comfort from seasons plenty turn
While the brave caught chaos with mistress
Born we the flesh blood of our dead kin
Renew we the soul blood of our gods
Meet gods draft seems drawn from many realms
