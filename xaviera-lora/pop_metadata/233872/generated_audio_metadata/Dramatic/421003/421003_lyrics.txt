I cannot see
It's happening to me
But now it is indeed
It's happening to me
And I'm lightheaded from talking to myself
And just as I dread it
Your answer is to up and run away
It's not that I don't trust you
Your faith and loyalty
Are clear and plain to see
Who I don't trust is me
Could a spoonful of honey help this bitter-tasting pill?
The penny-mince may hide its summit's clear
But the mirror never will
I cannot hear
There's pounding in my ears
And I cannot say
These words I try to say
And I cannot do
The things I said I'd do
And I cannot breathe
