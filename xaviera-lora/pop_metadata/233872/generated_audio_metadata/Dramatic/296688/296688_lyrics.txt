Well done, son, well done
I love who you've become
You're just the way
I loved the man in you, I see
Well done, my son, well done
Well done, dad, well done
You helped me to become
The best I could be, you set me free
I love the you in me, I see
Well done, dad, well done
My daughter, my love, well done
I love who you've become
You're just the way I hoped you'd be
A woman strong, courageous and free
My daughter, my love, well done
Well done, mom, well done
You've helped me to become
The best I could be, you set me free
I love the you in me, I see, well done
Mom, well done
Well done, my friends, well done
You've helped me to become
The best I could be, you've set me free
I love the you in me, I see
Well done my friends, well done
Well done my friends, well done
