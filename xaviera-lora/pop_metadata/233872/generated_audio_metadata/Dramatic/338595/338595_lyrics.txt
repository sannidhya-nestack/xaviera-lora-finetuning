I think he's funny, quoting Bugs Bunny
I never get my fill of the rabbit of Seville
He laughs at my pun, but is he the one?
I might be absolutely positively certain
This is love
How serendipitous that he digs old sci-fi
Saucers and Moon Pie
That Star Wars can't replace Plan 9 from outer space
I seem to agree with his POV
I could be absolutely positively certain
This is love
We had so much in common meeting at the drugstore sale on Echinacea
To think perchance a little cold might lead to more like having to hold
Or so I'm told that he plays his LPs never MP3s
I think vinyl is divine, is this coincidence a sign?
It's much too soon to celebrate, it's likely just another date
We'll see if this hypothesis concludes
If I'm absolutely positively certain
This is love
Disco is kitschy
Bee Gees and Richie
We hustle with the flare of Rogers and Astaire
We're dancing, how great
We both count to eight
I should be absolutely positively certain
This is love
I'll bet that he's had miso, although it wouldn't be so strange or accidental
The things he likes are what I like, I minored and he majored in psych
A lucky strike, he howls at the far side
Cow as the June bride
That Larson is a hoot
There is nothing to refute
I feel a tingle in my toes
Is this it, do you suppose
There will be that magic when we kiss
I'm absolutely positively certain
I'm in love
