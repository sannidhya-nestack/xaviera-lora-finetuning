In the wake of a common disaster
Nothing comes any faster
Than the pain from you to get through
And the pace of the time moving slower
And the day's getting duller
Got no more to lose
Wait for you
Moving on
In the face of an absolute truth
There's a place for you inside
If it's all I can do
At the end
Of this meeting by chance
There's a place for all the goodbyes
To this bleeding romance
If you've abandoned all iveness
If you're stepping off this ride
If you're standing your resistance
If you're darkening this night
There'll be a time when you'll remember
And you'll know the chances passed you by
When the silence screams and the tears they seem
You've been crying
A hundred thousand tears
A hundred thousand tears
A hundred thousand tears
There'll be a time when you'll remember
And you'll know the chances passed you by
When the silence screams and the tears they seem
You've been crying a hundred thousand tears
A hundred thousand tears
A hundred thousand years
A hundred thousand
