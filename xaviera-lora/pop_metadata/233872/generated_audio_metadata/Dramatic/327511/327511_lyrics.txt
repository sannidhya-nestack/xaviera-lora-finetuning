I know it's been a while
I know we said goodbye
But my heart still aches
The longer we're apart the more it breaks
Pictures and memories
Wish I could set them free but I can't
Oh no, I'm captured in your trance forevermore
Can we go back in time for a little while baby
I just know somehow
If we leave right now
We'll make it back in time
Our love is waiting
Cross my heart and soul
Baby can we go back in time
You were my best friend
I turned around and then you were gone
No trace, no so long
You just slipped away
Can we go back in time
For a little while baby
I just know somehow
If we leave right now
We'll make it back in time
Our love is waiting
Cross my heart and soul
Baby can we go back in time
Every day and night I think of you
Is it wrong or right? What should I do?
I'm so lost without you
Can we go back in time for a little while baby
I just know somehow
If we leave right now, we'll make it back in time
Our love is waiting, cross my heart and soul
Baby can we go?
Back in time
Back in time
