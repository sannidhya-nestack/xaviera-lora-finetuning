I have loved you in the winter And I've loved you through the spring
I will love you in the summertime
And with the mists that autumn brings
I have loved you since our first touch
On the day that we met
And I'll love you now and forever
Until time itself ets
I have loved you in the morning
And I've loved you through the day
I will love you in the eventide
Until the stars they fade away
When we feel our hearts beat
It's as if they are one
Then the moments that our lips meet
I know that heaven has come
For I have loved you in the winter
And I've loved you through the spring
I will love you in the summertime
And with the mist that autumn brings
I have loved you since our first touch
On the day that we met
And I'll love you now and forever
Until time
It's self- etting (Till time, time, time, it's self- etting)
Till time itself ets
