Another shoulder to cry
Your heart is frozen in ice
Amazing it seems to be
When she's standing with you
Wonder can she see me
As you're down on your knees
Broken heart
A distant flicker of sun is drenched over the sea
A bottle of love can be another person's disease
A seven-sevenths a sum inside a kingdom of need
Has he always been wrong or maybe this is the key
Broken hearts
Broken hearts
Maybe this is the key
Broken hearts
Maybe this is the key
Broken hearts
Maybe this is the key
Broken hearts
Maybe this is the key
