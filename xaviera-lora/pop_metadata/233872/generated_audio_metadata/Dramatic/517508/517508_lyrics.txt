My baby is so sweet, I like a cherry, I like a chocolate treat
She's finer than fine
She said she'd love me'til the end of time
My darling, she's my Valentine
I'll stop the world on a dime
Just to please my girl
Just to see her smile
I love the way she sparkles and shines
My darling, she's my Valentine
She said she'd love me'til the end of time
My darling, she's my Valentine
