Mm, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's in the stories that we say
Like someone's waiting to be told
The act encompasses the play
We watch the scenes we live and fall
Ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh o
Who's around?
Around?
It's in the stories that we say
Like someone's waiting to be told
Who's around?
