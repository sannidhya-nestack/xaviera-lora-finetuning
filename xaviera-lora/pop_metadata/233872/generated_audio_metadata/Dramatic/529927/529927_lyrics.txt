Every day, everywhere
I'm living with a little scare
Without you
Everywhere, every smile
Reminds me all it was when
Between us
All I want is to et my love
All I need is you to lift my troubles
All I want is to et my love
All I need is you to leave my trouble
Maybe I'm wrong
I should believe I should be strong
Without you
Nevermore
In my arms, right to the end I'll be left
Lack of you
All I want is to et my love
All I need is you to leave my trouble
All I want is to et my love
All I need is you to leave my trouble
No one could help me
No
Save me, I'm also in love
Falling in love, love
All I want is to et my love
All I need is you to leave my trouble
All I want is to et my love
All I need is you to leave my trouble
