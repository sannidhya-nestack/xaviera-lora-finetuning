Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Let's pretend this never happened
Let's pretend this never happened
Let's pretend this never happened
Let's pretend this never happened
Let's pretend this never happened
Let's pretend this never happened
Let's pretend this never happened
Let's pretend this never happened
Now the time has come to go
And focus on our leaving
We can't stay here as we know
No use to get your views in
Let's pretend this never happened
Let's pretend this never happened
Let's pretend this never happened
Let's pretend this never happened
Let's pretend this never happened
