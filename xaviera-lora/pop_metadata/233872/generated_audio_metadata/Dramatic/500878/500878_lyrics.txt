Don't run away, oh no, from panic
When you feel the panic mount
Take a deep breath and as you breathe out
Let go, keep trying
Stay there almost as if you were floating in space
Don't fight the feeling of panic
Accept it, you can do it
Accept it, you can do it, you can do it
You can do it
Don't run away from panic
When you feel the panic mount
Take a deep breath and as you breathe out let go
(Breathing)
Oh, don't run away from it
