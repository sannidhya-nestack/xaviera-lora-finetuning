Figures and weight
Silence occupies minds
Frozen in this time
Oh I know you don't see the tears
Running down my tree for a while
Running down for a while
Running down for a while
Oh
Running down my cheese again
Running down my cheese again
Running down my cheese again
Running down my cheese again
'Cause I don't mind if you give up too
Give up too, you give up too
'Cause I don't mind if you give up too
Give up too, give up too
