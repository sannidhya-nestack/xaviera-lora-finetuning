Sparrow, take your flight under the stars
All alone
Though it's dead of night, your vision is strong
All alone
And when the time is right
You will come back down
Find yourself a new world
If the time never comes when it's right for you
That's yours to choose
Everybody fears Sparrow will fall
So frail, so small
There's a secret strength Sparrow has learned
So can we if we let the sparrow fly?
Sparrow fly, let the sparrow
