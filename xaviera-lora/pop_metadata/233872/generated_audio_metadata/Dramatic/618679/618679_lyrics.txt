Hear my soul, it moves for you
And in my heart, you hear my voice calling
Two hearts that are broken and broken in two
Two minds that are so messed up don't know what to do
Yeah, in my soul, deep in my soul it aches for you
In my soul, in my soul it aches for you
Mm, oh yeah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
You hear me
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Ooh, hey, yeah, uh-huh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
