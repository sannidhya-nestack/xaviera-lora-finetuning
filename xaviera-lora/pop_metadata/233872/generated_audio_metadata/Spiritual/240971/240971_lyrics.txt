Your love and mercy bring me inside
Rush like a river strong and mighty white
Stretch out iveness, hold crimson tight
Release your spirit, love pours from your side and on
With all the world has shown me
You are everything I need
All that really matters
Is you would die for me
Now I want to tell you
That you, you, you are beautiful
You are beautiful
You are beautiful
And your mercy made a place for me to see
You are beautiful
Your mercy never ends
Your crown of glory you left behind
The fond you wore of sin and shame were mine
The step down from heaven, love crucified
Your death made sure the veil was torn aside and on
With all the world to show me
You are everything I need
All that really matters
Is you were dying for me
Now I want to tell you
That you, you, you are beautiful
You are beautiful
You are beautiful
And your mercy made a place for me to see
You are beautiful
Love and mercy
Love and mercy
Love and mercy like a river
Flowing through my life and I will
I will bow down, give you my heart
Loving you'cause you are beautiful
You are beautiful
You are beautiful
And your mercy made a place for me to see
You are beautiful
You are beautiful
You are beautiful
You are beautiful
