Life, the chance to live
The chance to learn, the chance to teach, a chance to give
Test
You made a choice
You took a stand, you took the oath, you found your voice
You made the sacrifice
Then you took God's advice
You heard your call to courage
The public trust
Protecting lives
Respect and pride
To serve and honor
Oh faith
Your trust in God
That special path
You must be brave
To guard our freedom
When your life's on the line
In your heart and your mind
You have a call to courage
I caught you, I caught you, too, very rich
Shield
The public trust
Protecting lives
Respect and pride
To serve and honor
Oh faith
Your trust in God
That special path
You must be brave
To guard our freedom
When your life's on the line
In your heart and your mind
You have a call to courage
When your life's on the line
In your heart and your mind
You have a call to courage
Bring your life on the line
In your heart and your mind
You have a call to courage
When you're not on the line
In your heart, in your mind, you have a call
