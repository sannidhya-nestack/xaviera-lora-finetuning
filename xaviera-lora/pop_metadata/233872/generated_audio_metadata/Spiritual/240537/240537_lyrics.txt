There was a time I thought my fighting was alone
Until I realized someone close to me was gone
See the problem was hiding right under my nose
And now was the time to take my mind off me I suppose
Never alone until you came into my heart
Never alone
Me from the dark (never alone)
Oh God, it's you I adore
Never alone
You have showed me through, obedient to you
That your word and your promise to this world is true
I would never be ashamed or turn away from you
'Cause your love has cost my broken heart to mend, oh God, you promised
You said you'd never leave me, never forsake me
Not one of the righteous have been forsaken or his seed begging bread
But Lord I know your word is true and I will forever resort to you
Never alone (oh Lord)'Til You came into my heart (oh Lord)
You brought me from a mighty long way (yes You did) Never alone (oh Lord)
Lord, I'm willing to do what you want me to do (do what you want me to do)
Say what you want me to say (say what you want me to say)
Remember you want me to do
(Yes I am)'Cause Lord I love you (Love you) I adore you (Adore you) Yes I do, yeah
Never alone, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Never alone) Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
If you tell me to jump I'll say how high
Yes I will, when you tell me to please just tell me what to say, yes I will, oh lord
