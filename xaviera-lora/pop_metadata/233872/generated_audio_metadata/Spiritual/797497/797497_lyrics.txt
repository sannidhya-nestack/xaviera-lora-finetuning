I need Jesus, my need I now confess
No friend like him in times of deep distress
I need Jesus, the need I gladly own
Though some may bear the load alone
Yet I need Jesus, I need Jesus
I need Jesus
I need Jesus every day
Need Him in the sunshine hour
Need Him when the storm clouds roar
Every day along my way
Yes, I need Jesus
I need Jesus
I need a friend like Him
A friend to guide
When paths of life are dim
I need Jesus
When foes my soul assail
Alone I know I can but fail
So I need Jesus
I need Jesus
I need Jesus
I need Jesus every day
Oh, I need him in the sunshine hour
Need him when the storm clouds roar
Every day along my way
Yes, I need Jesus
I need Jesus, I need him to the end
No one like him, he is a sinner's friend
Oh, I need Jesus
No other friend will do
So constant, kind, so strong and true
Yes, I, I need Jesus
I need Jesus
Oh, I need Jesus
Oh, I need Jesus every day
I need him in the sunshine hour
Need him when the storm clouds roar
Every day along my way
Yes, I need Jesus
Every day along my way
Yes, I need Jesus
I need, I need Jesus
