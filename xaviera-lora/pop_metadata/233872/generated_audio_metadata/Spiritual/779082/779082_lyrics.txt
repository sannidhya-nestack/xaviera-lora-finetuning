I lost my faith and fell from grace
There isn't much more I can say
If there's a reason why I'm still alive
It's as plain as the love on your face
I lost my job, they downsized today
I saw my future fade away
But I won't despair
I know you're here
It's as plain as the love on your face
There will be bright tomorrows
Fresh as an ocean spray
As long as you are mine I won't wallow
In the pain of yesterday
Yes, just as long as you light my way
I'll face my troubles, come what may
Because I know you're the pilot of my soul
It's as plain as the love on your face
There's one thing that time will not erase
It's as plain as the love on your face
It's as plain as the love on your face
