I know more now than I did then
It doesn't really matter though
It doesn't matter what I know until I know what matters
I wonder how
I wonder when
It doesn't really matter though, when I wonder what I know
Until I find what matters
Did you really think that you were all alone in this
Did you really think that you were all alone?
Come my way, walk my waves
I know more now than I did then
It doesn't really matter though
It doesn't matter what I know until I know what matters
I wonder how, I wonder when
It doesn't really matter though
When I wonder what I know
Until I find what matters
Did you really think
That you were all alone in this?
Did you really think
That you were all
Come my way, walk my waves
Come my way, walk my waves
Too often, too much to say
False prophets in our prime
Too lofty all the time
When we should give away
What we won't understand
Leave matters up to larger hands
Did you really think that you were all alone in this?
Did you really think that you were all alone?
Come my way, walk my waves
Come my way, walk my waves
Come my way
