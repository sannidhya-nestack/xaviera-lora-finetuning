I stand here a weak and weary man
I have witnessed God's very hand moving in my life
And I believe
Could I turn away and not have known
I'm speechless now because you've shown your words alive
I'm free and I believe
I believe in you, the bright and morning star
I am that I am, you are
You are man of sorrows acquainted with grief
You came to shed light on unbelief
They cursed your name, oh but I believe
They placed the crown of thorns upon your head
And you said not a word as you bled
A lamb to slaughter led
Yes, I believe
I believe in you, oh, the bright and morning star
I am that I am, you are
You are, you are coming soon
In the twinkling of an eye
And I'll be caught with you
In the twinkling of an eye
Believe, oh
Oh why I believe
I stand here a weak and weary man
Oh why I believe
