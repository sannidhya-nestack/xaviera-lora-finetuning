Gathered here to spread good news
We have come to stand up for the truth
Jesus is alive so let everyone know
We come in adoration and it isn't a show, no
We come in adoration and it isn't a show
We have come to worship God on high
Count on Jesus in the midst of strife
Where Jesus walks alone the devil has to go
We come in adoration and it isn't a show
No, we come in adoration and it isn't a show
I heard there is peace for my very soul
I found Jesus, He has made me whole
In Him I found my shelter when the strong winds blow
I come in adoration and it isn't a show
Oh, I come in adoration and it isn't a show

No, we call it aberration and it isn't a show
