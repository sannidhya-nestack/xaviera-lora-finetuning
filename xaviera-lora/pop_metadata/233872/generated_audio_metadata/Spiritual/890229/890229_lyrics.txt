Round him with many crowns
The Lamb upon His throne
Our calling heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own
Awake, my soul, and sing of Him who died for thee
And hail Him as thy matchless King through all eternity
Crown Him the Lord of life, who triumphed o'er the grave
He came to save, His glory's now we sing
Who died and rose on high?
Who died eternal life to bring?
And lives that death may die
One with the Lord of heaven, one with the Father known
One with the Spirit through Him given from yonder glorious throne
To thee
For Thou for us hast died, be Thou, O Lord, through endless days, adored and magnified
