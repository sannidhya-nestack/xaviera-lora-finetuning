When I survey
The wondrous cross
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
Save in the death of Christ my God
All the vain things that charm me most
I sacrifice
Them to his blood
See from his head, his hands, his feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown
Were the whole realm of nature mine?
That were an offering
Far too small
Love so amazing
Oh so divine
Demands my soul
My life, my all
Love so amazing, love so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my whole
Demands my soul
My life, my all, ooh
