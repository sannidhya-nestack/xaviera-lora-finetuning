Watchin' the preacher man on the television show
He said, "Send me some seed money and God will bless your soul"
Lots of folks been sending him all kinds of seeds
He's growing diamonds on his fingers and his hair is bleached
Tell me who got the, who got the, who got the, who got the truth
What is the truth of the precious truth
Thousands of people in a grand stadium
Watching the man dressed in a white suit
Cleans his heels by the weight of his hand
No one ever sees the ones in the wheelchairs on the side
The camera never shows all the tears in their eyes
Tell me who got, who got, who got, who got the crew
What is the truth
What a precious truth
Scanning the radio stations in my Chevy van
Came across the program it was the Bible and some man
Old Hank said if you can't find it in the good book
You can bet your money that it's counterfeit
Tell me who got the, who got the, who got the, who got the truth
What is the truth, oh the precious truth
Tell me who got the, who got the, who got the, who got the, who got the, who got the, who got the, who got the, who got the, who got the, who got the truth
Who got the truth
What is the truth
Of the precious truth
What is the truth
What is the truth
Oh, the pressure's true
What is the truth
What is the truth
Oh, the pressure's true
What is the truth
What is the truth
Oh, the pressure's true
What is the truth? What is the truth? What is the truth?
