Now listen to me children don't you weep and moan
What's past is past and what's gone is gone
Carry your burden and don't complain
Your work and tears won't be in vain
one of these days
One of these days
One of these days
Things will be different on the judgment day
Now the jealous man, he won't understand
The children will inherit the promised land
Beasts will come and war will end
The lion will lay down with the lamb
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
Things will be different on the judgment day
Now the deaf will hear and the dumb will talk
The blind will see and the lame will walk
The lord above will hear your cries
The wicked will fall and the meek will rise
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
Things will be different on the judgment day
Now death will come and take its toll
And the devil might try to grab your soul
Don't you worry what the future will bring
Just raise your voice and begin to sing
one of these days
One of these days
One of these days
Things will be different on the judgment day
You better build your house on the solid rock
Or Jesus gonna be your stumbling block
Grab that devil and move him out
Clap your hands and sing and shout
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
Things will be different on the judgment day
