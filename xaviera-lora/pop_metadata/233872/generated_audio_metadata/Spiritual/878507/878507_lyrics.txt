Lord, I was angry
But you touched my heart
Now, Lord, I am angry no more
Lord, I was wounded
You came and healed me
Now, Lord, I am wounded no more
And I stand you witness
To the power that lives in your name
In the light of your glory
There is mercy and grace
In the light of your glory
There is peace in this place
In the light of your glory
There is love, sweet love in this place
In the light of your glory we are one
Lord I was searching and you heard me calling
Now I am searching no more
Lord, I was lost and confused
You cleared my head
Now I see clearly again
And I stand here witness
To the power that lives in your name
In the light of your glory
There is mercy and grace
In the light of your glory
There is peace in this place
In the light of your glory
There is love, sweet love
In the light of your glory
We are one
Lord, I was empty
Lord I am empty no more
Lord I was guilty in need of iveness
Now I'm iven forevermore
And I stand here a witness
To the power that lives in your name
In the light of your glory
There is mercy and grace
In the light of your glory
Lord there is peace in this place
In the light of your glory
Lord there is love, sweet, sweet love
In the light, light of your glory
We are one
