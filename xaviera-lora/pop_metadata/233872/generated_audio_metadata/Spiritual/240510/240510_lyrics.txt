I see his light as it flutters so low
In the hearts of men it's just barely a glow
Where are his people, the chosen ones?
Who has returned of his renegade sons?
He was a man and he's been here before
He's telling you the answers at the door
He was a man and he's been here before
He's telling you the answers at the door
He's pouring out his spirit and the words start to flow
He's taking names by most people down now
Who's gonna believe, go out to proclaim
Who's gonna stand on the rooftops and shout out his name
He was a man and he's been here before
He's telling you the answers at the door
He was a man and he's been here before
He's telling you the answers at the door
The wind is blowing and the night moves along
I hear people singing a brand new song
This is close and you can hear what they say
Jesus is the truth, the life and the way
He was a man and he's been here before
He's telling you the answers at the door
He was a man and he's been here before
He's telling you the answers at the door
He was a man and he's been here before
He's telling you the answers at the door
