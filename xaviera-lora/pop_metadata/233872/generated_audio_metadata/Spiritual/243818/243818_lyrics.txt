I'll be gone someday, so far away
And you'll still be here, here without me
And you'll wonder where I am, yeah you'll wonder where I am
But I'm right here next to you
I'll be inside
I'll be inside
Deep inside your heart
Where we'll never be apart
I'll be inside
I'll be inside
And you'll never be alone
I wouldn't leave you on your own
You'll et about me, you'll move on
And there'll be times when you don't even remember that place we called home
You'll be moving on
You'll be staying strong
And I'll be right here next to you
I'll be inside
I'll be inside
Deep inside your heart
Where we'll never be apart
I'll be inside
I'll be inside
And you'll never be alone
I wouldn't leave you on your own
I'll be inside
