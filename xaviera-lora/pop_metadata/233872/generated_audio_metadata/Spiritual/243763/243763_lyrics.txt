Oh, I gotta stand on it
Stand on the Word, stand on the Word, stand on God's Word
Stand on the Word of God, stand on the Word, stand on God's Word
The strategies and fiery dots seem cruel
At your weakest point darkness appears to rule
I've learned something and I'll pass it on to you
To maintain your peace
Here is what you've got to do, Joe (Stand on the Word, stand on the Word, stand on God's Word)
Stand on the Word of God (Stand on the Word, stand on the Word, stand on God's Word)
It's a burnt foundation
He just promised that he would carry the load, yeah
Don't stop pressing or let your guard down
The purpose of this trial is your arrival on higher ground, John (say no more words, say no more words)
God's word
Let your feelings stand
Stand on the word, stand on the word, stand on God's word
Your way is already made
You're gonna make a discovery
Talk those hurtin' words with him around
And give him peace and love that you will never see
He loves you, stand on it
Oh, you can stand on it
Standing at the open door (you're standing at the open door)
More than just a conqueror in a ragged-rugged match-up door (you're more than a conqueror)
It's a defeated foe (he's defeated) stand on it (you know that)
You can stand on it
Equipped to handle anything (you can handle it) following the mighty king ('cause he's prepared, kid)
Standing around, you don't look back, you don't want to get off track
You know you don't wanna get off
Stands on the world
Greater is he that is in you
Stands on the world
Than he that is in the world
You can't stand on the world
No weapon formed against you shall break
Every tongue that rises against you will speak
You can, you can (stand on the wall)
Trust in the Lord with all thine heart
Lead not to your own understanding
You know you can
Stand on it (stand on the word)
The Lord, He loves you, He loves you
You know that you can trust Him
And that's why, that's why today we know you can (stand on it)
You can stand on the word of God
His word is true, His word is true and you know it
You can't stand on it
God is not a man that he should lie
Neither the son of man that he should repent
You can't stand on it
His word says you're more than a conqueror
So you can't stand on it
