Abide with me, fast holds the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide
When other help
Fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless
Oh abide with me
I need Thy presence
Every passing hour
What but Thy grace can
For the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself
My Guide and Sake can be?
Through cloud and sunshine
O abide with me
I fear no foe, with thee at hand to bless
Ears have no weight and tears no bitterness
Where is death's sting?
Where, great, thy victory?
I triumph still if thou abide with me
