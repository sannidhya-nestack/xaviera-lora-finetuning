A special type of presence is watching over me
I've felt this before but that can't be
My heart is beating faster there's no one to be seen
Yet I know she's here, her love is with me
So long I've spent all my lifetime searching
For the soul I once loved
My heart, her love, both bound forever
Repeating destiny
My voice whispers to her, her eyes show me on
How our love had begun before we had known
I hold you so close and she'll never let go
The picture's now clear
We've shared our love before
I've spent all my lifetime searching
For the soul I once loved
My heart and love both bound forever
Repeating destiny
Will this fate be everlasting?
Love from so long ago
Her eyes have told the perfect story
Two souls will always be
Our souls will always be
Be as one
