Come on, let's clap your hands now
Go and listen to that preacher
he has a tale to tell
the trials and tribulations
How to keep you out of hell
See it works on family values
That'll teach you in a blast
Said the only way for you to be saved
Is to get me on your cast
She never lied, she never compromised herself
She never lied
She gave her whole life of devotion
To her righteous catholic coup
And left us stranded in her twilight
Just to save a motherfuckin' tooth
She tried to print a case to the diocese
We need justice to figure the need
To find the truth that's hidden in all of this holy conspiracy
In the land of milk and honey
There are some of us who pray
A man is gonna kick back our precious money
Take a dive on judgment day
She never lied, she never compromised herself
She never lied
Gave her whole life of devotion
To the righteous Catholic coup
They left her stranded in her twilight
Just to save'em a buck or two
She tried to print a case to the diocese
We need justice bigger than me
To find the truth that's hidden in all of this holy conspiracy
One, two, three, four
She never lies, she never compromised herself
She never lies
She gave her whole life of devotion
To a righteous Catholic coup
They left her stranded in her twilight
Just to save'em a buck or two
She tried to plead her case to the Diocese
We need justice to be the mean
To find the truth that's hidden in all of this holy conspiracy
To find the truth that's hidden in all of this holy conspiracy
To find the truth that's hidden in all of this holy conspiracy
