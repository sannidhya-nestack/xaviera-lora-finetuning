Here we are, in this place
Calling from our hearts
Hear us Lord, send your grace
Let revival start
Lead us Lord, change us Lord
We are desperately in need
Fill us Lord, use us Lord
Let your presence be revealed
Give us passion for you
Let our lives burn bright
Shining only for you
Overcoming the night
Let us stand for the truth
In our fallen grace
Give us passion for you
Seeking only your face
Oh God, give us a passion for you
Here we are, in this place
Calling from our hearts
Hear us, Lord, sing your praise
Let revival start
Lead us, Lord, change us, Lord
We are desperately in need
Fill us Lord, please use us Lord
Let your presence be revealed
Give us passion for you
Let our lives burn bright
Shining only for you
Overcoming the night
Let us stand for the truth
In our Father in grace
Give us passion for you
Seeking only your face
Give us passion for you
Let our lives burn bright
Shining only for you
Overcoming the night
Let us stand for the truth
In our fallen grace
Giving us passion for you
Seeking only your face
