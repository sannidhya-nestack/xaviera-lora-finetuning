He walks through the woods over branches and limbs
Watching the clouds as they slowly roll in
He takes a deep breath as he knows his time is near
Thinking of God as the flakes melt on his chin
Reaching the end of an old familiar path
A chill runs through his spine
Like a winter tree he sways with the wind
Feeling the cold in the lines on his face
Like a winter tree, he waits for spring
Knowing it brings a new rebirth
And again today, he waits patiently
Like a winter tree
He crosses the creek and looks on the land
Watching the deer as they drink and play
His name is on a rock he carved there as a child
But today he sits on it only to pray
He's seen many years come and go
Like colors in a leaf
And rainbows like a winter tree
He sways with the wind
Feeling the cold in the lines on his face
Like a winter tree
He waits for spring
Knowing he brings a new rebirth
And again today
He waits patiently
Like a winter tree
He feels longer nights and sees shorter days
But weathers through the season anyway
Like a winter tree he sways with the wind
Feeling the cold in the lines on his face
Like a winter tree he waits for spring
Knowing it brings a new rebirth
And again today
He waits patiently
Like a winter tree
Like a winter tree
Like a winter tree
