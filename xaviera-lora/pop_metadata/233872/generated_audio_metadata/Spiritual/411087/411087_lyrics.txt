I hold the key to everything you see
And all you have to do is follow me
I hold the door to what you're looking for
Step in inside, come in to find out more
Just hold my hand and you will understand
That I am God and I can be your friend
Just hold me close
I'll be your driving force
I'm God and I love you the most
I'm in the air
In fact, I'm everywhere
For now I'm here, oh wait, well now I'm there
I'm always near, I never disappear
I speak to all but just the greatest here
My hand, you will understand
That I'm God and I can be your friend
Just hold me close, I'll be your driving force
Love you the most
All of this time that's passed is not lost
All of this time that's passed is not lost
