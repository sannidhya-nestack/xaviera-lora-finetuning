Light befalls the dark
I knew the beginning if our eyes could see the way
The gift of life hides behind the fears we hold up high
The fears that shade the light and cloud the way
Lord, I hear you say
You are the way, the truth, the life, fear not the day
You will carry me up high
Up high into the light
The coming of the dawn, the Lord's new day
When the evening comes and darkness fills my eyes
Fear will find no place in my soul
In your arms I'll be
The light upon my face
In your arms to stay forevermore
Lord, carry me
Into the light that shines from you that I may see
In your arms, safe and strong
You carry me along
Within your faithful arms I'll always be
When the evening comes and darkness fills my eyes
Fear will find no place in my soul
In your arms I'll be
The light upon my face
In your arms to stay forevermore
Lord, carry me
Into the light that shines from you that I may see
In your arms, safe and strong
You carry me along
Within your faithful arms I'll always be
