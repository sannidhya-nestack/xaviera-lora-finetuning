Jesus in an upper room turned to the twelve and said
One of you's a traitor and I will soon be dead
Each disciple heard the words and felt an awful dread
And they began to murmur
As they supped and broke the bread
One of you will betray me, who will it be?
Is it I, is it I, Lord, will it now be me?
The question of each wounded soul, a dreaded destiny
Is it I, is it I, Lord, will it now be me?
I have grown in wisdom and in grace to follow thee
But many have rejected me and said it cannot be
Who I am will never bring you honor
They will say, they will say
And having heard so many lies, I want the truth today
One of you will betray me, who will it be?
Is it I? Is it I? Lord, will it now be me?
The question of each wounded soul, a dreaded destiny
Is it I? Is it I? Lord, will it now be me?
If I have rejected you, struggling to be me
Let me know I'll find myself in you
If there's some pain I cannot release
Remind me that your heart was broken too
One of you will betray me, who will it be?
Is it I, is it I, Lord, will it now be me? (Is it I)
The question of each wounded soul, a dreaded destiny
Is it I, is it I, Lord, will it now be me?
One of you will betray me
Who will it be? Is it I? Is it I? Lord, will it now be me?
The question of each wounded soul, a dreaded destiny
Is it I? Is it I? Lord, will it now be me?
The question of each wounded soul, a dreaded destiny
Is it I? Is it I? Lord, will it now be me?
