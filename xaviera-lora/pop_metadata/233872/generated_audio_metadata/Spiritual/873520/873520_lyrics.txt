Open up your mouth and start to speak
Say it like you mean it, make the microphone believe it
Open up your eyes and start to see
Read between the lines, see through their pretty little lies
Open up your hands and let them bleed
'Cause they nailed you to the billboards where they hung you up and shut the door
They threw pennies and dimes in the back seat
Yes they threw pennies and dimes in the back seat
What I got, you gotta put it in your pocket
Way down deep, everybody talk about it
What I got, you gotta hold on tight
Make it right before the sacrifice
Everybody talkin', everybody talk about it
Everybody talkin', everybody talk about it
Everybody talkin', everybody talkin'
Everybody talkin', everybody talk about you
So open up your mouth and speak the truth (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Open up your heart and start to beat
Feel the rhythm in your veins
This hungry pulse is hard to tame
Open up your eyes and believe
Seek and ye shall find sometimes the truth is hard to hide
You've got to open up your mind and set it free
they nailed you to the pillbox where they hung you up
And shut the door what they threw pennies and nines in the backseat
Yes, it threw pennies and dimes in the backseat
I'm gonna speak no evil (Yes, Lord, yes, Lord)
I'm gonna speak up for my people
I'm gonna sing and speak no evil
I'm gonna speak no evil for my Lord
What I got, you gotta put it in your pocket
Way down deep, everybody talk about it
What I got, you gotta hold on tight
Make it right before the sacrifice
Everybody talking, everybody talk about it
Everybody talking, everybody talk about it
Everybody talking, everybody talking
Everybody talking, everybody talk about you
So open up your mouth and speak the truth
I'm gonna speak no evil
Yes Lord, yes Lord
I'm gonna speak up for my people
Yes Lord, yes Lord
I'm gonna speak no evil
Yes Lord, yes Lord
I'm gonna speak up for my people
I'm gonna speak and speak no evil
I'm gonna speak no evil for my Lord
