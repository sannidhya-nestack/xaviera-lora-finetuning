I hear folks call him the pavement parson
Cause he preaches to the sidewalk crowd
His clothes are old and ragged, reads the good book right out loud
Some will stop, most pass by
He never gets depressed
When I asked what keeps him going
He said, "Son, I'm heaven blessed"
There's a glory train waiting in the sky for me
Gonna carry me to salvation
Set my burden free
There's a glory train
That we all can get on board
And we'll ride to the promised land
To be together
Forevermore
Well I couldn't help but wonder about the story of his life
So I bought him a cup of coffee
To warm his bones and we talked awhile
He said he was married to an angel
But in her last years she took ill
Though her treatment left him destitute
Her words console him still
She said there's a glory train
Waiting in the sky for me
Gonna carry me to salvation
Set my burden free
There's a glory train
That we all can get on board
And we'll ride to the promised land
To be together
Forevermore
And I decided right then and there to be more thankful for what I have
Get my heart and mind prepared to take that journey and not look back
Do all that I can to board that glory train waiting in the sky for me
Gonna carry me to salvation
Set my burden free
There's a glory train
That we all can get on board
And we'll ride to the promised land to be together
On that glory train
Waiting in the sky for me
Gonna carry me to salvation
Set my burden free
There's a glory train
That we all can get on board
And we'll ride to the promised land to be together
Forevermore
Hear the moon (Hear the moon)
