Pastor sheltered the homeless and he clothed the poor
He fed all the hungry who came to his door
We told him, "Be careful," so he filled with care
For him being cautious meant start with a prayer
Some came longing for freedom, enticed by his joy
Some came broken with bitterness, bent to destroy
They could take what he owned, but what they did not know
They could not take his life, he gave that long ago
The blood of the martyrs, the seed of the church
What will we grow from this loss?
They answered the call with a passionate yes
And the mission they found was a cross
They followed the footsteps with nail prints clear through
Led by a shepherd who knew suffering too
When we look for heroes, it's their lives we search
The blood of the martyrs, the seed of the church
She was a rebel, a girl filled with pain
Her spirit was broken with failure and shame
Her family was sure she could not hear their pleas
But when she finally fell down, she fell down on her knees
And there she was lifted with strong gentle hand
When it came to choices she found strength to stand
Now two thousand classmates will come here to pray
Because of the price she was willing to pay
The blood of the martyrs, the seed of the church
What will we grow from this loss?
They answered the call with a passionate yes
And the mission they found was a cross
They followed the footsteps with nail prints clear through
Led by a shepherd who knew suffering too
When we look for heroes, it's their lives we search
The blood of the martyrs, the seed, the seed of the church
They followed the footsteps with nail prints clear through
Led by a shepherd who knew suffering too
When we look for heroes it's their lives we search
The blood of the martyrs, the seed of the church
