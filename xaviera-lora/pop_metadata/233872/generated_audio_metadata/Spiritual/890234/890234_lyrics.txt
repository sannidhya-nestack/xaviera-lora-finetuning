When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of Love
My riches gained, I've found but lost in poor content
Lord, that I should
Save in the day of Christ my God
All the vain things that charm me most
I sacrifice them to His blood
Sing from His hand, His hands, His feet
Sorrow and love flow in the damp
Didst such love and sorrow meet?
Or thorns composed so rich a crown?
Of nature mine
That where I love
With heart too small
Love so amazing
Is it so divine?
Demands my soul
Demands my soul
Love demands my soul
My life, my all
