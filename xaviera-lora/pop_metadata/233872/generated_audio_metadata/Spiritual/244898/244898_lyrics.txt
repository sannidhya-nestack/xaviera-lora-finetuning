Did you ever ride on a Jim Crow bus?
Did you ever ride on a Jim Crow train?
Black in the back, white in the front
You sit where you're told, not where you want
Courtesy depends upon the colour of your skin
The white man rides in comfort
But the black man don't fit in
After working all day at the factory
Rosa Parks paid a fare and took a seat
The driver turned around with his D-man
Let the white folks sit, Ms. Parks would have to stand
Rosa shook her head, the police took her off the bus
The black folks of Montgomery had finally had enough
Goodbye Jim Crow
You've been around too long
Segregated this and that
Something sure seems wrong
Rosa Parks and Martin will send you on your way
It's been a long time coming
When will we see the day
We can say goodbye Jim Crow
Martin Luther King was an Alabama preacher man
Who told the people it was time to take a stand
He anized a boycott to shut the buses down
They would walk'em till old Jim Crow left the town
Empty buses lined Montgomery streets throughout the year
The courts ruled on segregation
And the verdict was quite clear
Goodbye Jim Crow
You've been around too long
Segregated this and that
Something sure seems wrong
Rosa Parks and Martin have sent you on your way
It's been a long time coming
But we've finally seen the day
When we can say
Goodbye Jim Crow (Goodbye Jim Crow)
Goodbye Jim Crow
Goodbye Jim Crow, goodbye Jim Crow
Jim Crow bus, Jim Crow train
Sitting in the back just ain't the same
Had enough of this segregation
One equality throughout the nation
Pack your bags get out of here
Been around for too many years
Don't wanna see your face no more
Goodbye Jim Crow that's for sure
Jim Crow bus, Jim Crow train
Sitting in the back just ain't the same
