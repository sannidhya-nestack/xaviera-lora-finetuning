Open your eyes
Take a look at the world outside
Be happy just to be alive
Open your eyes
Find happiness in yourself
Enjoy your life with the ones you love
And when time passes by as silent as the night
And the life we share is a memory
Open your eyes
Don't let anything hold you down
You can do anything you want to do
Open your mind
Take a look at the world inside
Be happy just to
And when time passes by, the silent tells the night
And the life we shared is a memory
