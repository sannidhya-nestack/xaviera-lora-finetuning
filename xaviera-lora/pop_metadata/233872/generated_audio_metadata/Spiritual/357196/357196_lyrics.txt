I feel that I'm drowning
Drowning in empty seas
And walking through wastelands
On a road not meant for me
Do you see the madness?
Do you see my scarlet sin?
Let me hide no longer
Oh let this be the end if so come
Come and take my hand
Bring me oil and wine
Once again
Once again
Do you see the madness
Do you see my scarlet sin
Let me hide no longer
Oh let this be the end
So come
And take my hand
Bring me oil and wine
One second
Oh dry my eyes
Let me run no more
Just let me rest in the arms of the Lord
So come and take my hand
Bring me oil and wine once again
Dry my eyes, let me run no more
Just let me rest in the arms of so calm and take my hand
Bring me oil and wine once again
Oh dry my eyes, let me run no more
Just let me rest in the arms of the Lord
