Because You are eternally
The fullness of glory
Because You are and were and always will be
The Holy of Holies
Because forever you're the same
Yet everything you do is new
Because your name is far above any other name
But no one is closer than you
The choirs of heaven never cease
And I will sing Your praises all my days
The oceans ebb and flow at Your command
And man cannot interfere
The streams are mound to sing for all the wonders of your hand
And man cannot help but hear
The choirs of heaven never cease
Around the throne of grace
And I will sing your praises all my days
The choirs of heaven never cease
Around the throne of grace
And I will sing your praises all my days
I come, I bow
I give you my life
I come, I bow
I give you my life
I come
I bow, I give you my life
I come, I bow, I give you
I come, I bow, I give you my life
I come, I bow, I give you my life
The choirs of heaven never cease
Around the throne of grace
And I will sing your praises all my days (I will sing, I will joy with the heavens)
The choirs of heaven never cease (The choirs of heaven never cease)
The throne of grace (the throne of singing your praises)
And I will sing your praises all my days (I will sing your praises all my days)
Forever
And I will sing your praises all my days (And I will sing your praises all my days)
Sing your praise (And I will sing your praises all my days)
