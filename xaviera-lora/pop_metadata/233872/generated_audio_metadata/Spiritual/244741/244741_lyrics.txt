I was a little boy, you watched my first steps
I grew meek and so mild, you were there even as I wept
To comfort, to keep the child
Stay with me, oh stay with me
Don't you leave, oh hear me please
Stay with me, oh stay with me
Don't you leave, oh hear me please
And when I turned into a man
I drifted from the master plan
I found love in material things
And only pain is what it brings
To love you when I thought I can
You opened the door and I still ran
And I still reign
But stay with me, oh stay with me
Don't you leave, oh hear me please
Stay with me, oh stay with me
Don't you leave, oh hear me please
Now as the end comes near
I remember the child and man
Your words I hope to hear
That I'm still part of the plan
As pain continues to sear
With your love I will not fear
Stay with me, oh stay with me
Don't you leave, oh hear me please
Stay with me, oh stay with me
Don't you leave
No, stay with me, oh stay with me
Don't you leave, oh hear me please
Stay with me, oh stay with me
Don't you leave, oh don't you leave
Hear me please
