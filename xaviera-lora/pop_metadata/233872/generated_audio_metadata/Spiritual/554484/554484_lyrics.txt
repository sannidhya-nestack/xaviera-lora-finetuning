There is life at the end, eternity
There is life at the end, eternity
Lord, Lord
Jesus is my Savior
I got the victory
There is life at the end of eternity
Listen to this church
I've been up and I've been down in my life
But I'm determined to keep on standing for the right
You know why this is why
Listen to this
Jesus said I am the way, the truth and the life
There is life at the end, eternity
Let not your heart be troubled
And be not dismayed
Jesus said, for where I am
You will be there with me always
He said, I came to set you free
And to all that believe in me
There is life at the end
Eternity
Listen to this church
He healed the sick
And He raised up the dead
He fed five thousand
With two fish and a loaf of bread
He came to set you free
And to all that believe the victory
There is life at the end, eternity
I believe I say that one more time
He came to set you free
And to all that believe the victory
There is life at the end
There is life at the end
There is life at the end
Eternity, oh Lord, yes
