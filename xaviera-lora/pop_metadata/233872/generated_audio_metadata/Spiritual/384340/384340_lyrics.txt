I know it hurts, I know the storm is rough
Blowing on every side is hard to stand
It's easy to give up
But you don't have to fail
There is a way to win
In at this game
Some say
Some say don't look at the storm and it'll simply blow away
And I've been (I've been in the midst of the storm and I know the wind is real)
He heard my cry (He heard my cry)
And came walking out to me
He said those words (He said those words)
Peace be still and now I'm free
The dark clouds are still around
They follow me everywhere
The torrent is falling
And doesn't let up
But I have a shelter
His name is Jesus
And within there is no storm
That I cannot bear
Some say don't look at the storm
And it'll simply blow away
Simply blow away
I have been in the midst of a storm
And I know the wind is real
I know the wind
And came walking out to me (came walking out to me)
He said those words, "Peace, be still, now I'm free"
I'm free, free from all my suffering and shame
Now I can hold my head up high'cause I know Him
And no matter what may come my way
I know He will be there for me everyday
Some say don't look at the storm and it'll simply blow away (simply blow away)
I've been in the midst of the storm and I know the wind is (I know the wind)
Came walking out to me (came walking out to me)
He said his words, "Peace, be still" and now I'm free
I'm free
I'm free
I'm free
Are you free?
Are you free?
Are you free?
Are you
