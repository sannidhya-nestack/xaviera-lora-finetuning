When the blue thoughts leave, let the moment dies
For it's the only thing that's quite as in the endless sky
Early morning and dark surrounds me
It's the time when life feels right
Leaving my hometown and nothing is hurting yet
Moonless babe enlightens my way
Oh could I believe my eyes
I knew that life would be the perfect surprise
But what I found is that decision has all already been made
Oh, when the blue thoughts leave for little momentize
For it's the only thing that's twice as sunny as the sky
Make my way and though I'm lonely
Fever, what I do is fine
But once I stop and suddenly worry
Bring the phone at home just to know
Oh could I believe my eyes
I knew that life would be the perfect surprise
But what I've found is that decision has all already been made
Oh when the blue thoughts leave for little moment dies
For it's the only thing that surprises in the endless sky
A little moment dies, a little moment dies
That's precious in the endless skies
In that stream of left over hope
Now I see that I've got plenty of room in choosing the best path
Oh, when the blue thoughts leave, a little moment dies
For it's the only thing that finds us in the endless skies
A little moment dies
That's priceless in the endless
When the blue thoughts leave
A little moment dies
For it's the only thing
That's priceless in the endless skies
The only
Priceless in the endless skies
