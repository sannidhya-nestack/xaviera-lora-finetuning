Pour your living water out
Yours can end our spirit's drought
Like an everlasting fountain
Like an overflowing river
Like a never ending ocean
How great a flood of saving love
For every thirsty son and daughter
Spirit fall will soak us all
Come flood ourselves with living water
Call your people to the spring
Fall in power as we drink
Like an everlasting fountain
Like an overflowing river
Like an ever ending ocean
How great it feels
Flood of saving love
Forever thirsty son and daughter
Spirit fall
Oh soak us all
Come flood our souls with living water
Spirit fall
We're singing in the wilderness
Scream up, oh wow, the living wow
Until it's flowing out of us
Scream up, oh wow
I'm singing in the wilderness
Spring up, oh well, I'm living well
And tears flowing out of us
Spring up, oh well
We're singing in the wilderness
Spring up her well, the living well
Until it's flowing out of ice
Spring up her well
How great a flood of saving love
For every thirst and sun and shudder
Spirit fall and soak us all
Come flood our souls with living water
Great a flood of saving love
For every thirst and sun and shudder
Spirit fall and soak us all
Come flood our souls with living water
Flood our souls with living water
