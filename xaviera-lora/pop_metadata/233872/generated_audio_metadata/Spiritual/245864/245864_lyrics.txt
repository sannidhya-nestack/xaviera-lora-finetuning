When shadows appear
And hope is obscured by the tears in my eyes
When faith turns to fear
And dark clouds of worry arise
When I turn to run
And there is nowhere to hide
You are the one
Close to my side
You are the light in the dark
You're the cry in my heart
You are the rest in the storm
You're the way that leads home
You are the light
Just like a child
I get distracted and wander away
But your touch is kind
And back in your arms I am safe
And though I am small
You never laugh at me when I fall down
But love through it all
Counting each tear as your own
You're the light in my dark
You're the cry in my heart
You are the rest in the storm
You're the way with me so
You are the light
You're the light in my dark
You're the cry in my heart
You are the rest in the storm
You're the way that leads home
You are the light in my dark
You're the cry in my heart
You are the rest in the storm
You're the way that leads home
You are the light in my dark
You're the crying
You are the rest in the storm
You're the waving sun
You are the light tonight
