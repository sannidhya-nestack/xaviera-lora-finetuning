I just want to be found in your love
And no matter where I go
Your sweet love will never let me go
You have never left me lonely
You have been right by my side
Your love has been with me all the time
There is nothing else like your love
Nothing feels like your love, your love
There is nothing else like your love
Nothing feels like your love, your love
What the world needs is your love
So just use me as you can
Let me show true love to every man
It's so hard to show it
Like you have shown to me
That's the love I want the world to see
There is nothing else like your love
Nothing feels like your love, your love
There is nothing else like your love
Nothing feels like your love, your love
What the world needs is your love
So just use me as you can
Let me show true love to every man
It's so hard to show real love
Like you have shown to me
That's the love I want the world to see
There is nothing else like your love
Nothing feels like your love, your love
There is nothing else like your love
Nothing feels like your love, your love
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
