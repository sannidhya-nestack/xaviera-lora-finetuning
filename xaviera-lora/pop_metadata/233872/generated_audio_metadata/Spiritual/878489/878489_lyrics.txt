I will lift up your name
I will lift up your name
All creation stands to meet
The author of eternity
Who spins the universe and lights the sun
Lord my God you are the one
Your light shines inside my soul
You give me life you make me whole
Purified as water cleanse my sin
Your mighty kingdom has no end
Mountains rise and seas collide
And you hold it all together
The one who is and always was
The love that's like no other
Amazing love in the image of
The God who reigns forever
I will live to be your name
Gentle shepherd watch and eat
Shelter found beneath your wings
Love your seed, truth your weapon of choice
Nations sing together
He was born
Mountains rise and cease the light
And you hold it all together
The one who is and always was
Your love is like no other
Amazing love in the image of
A God who reigns forever
I will lift up your name
I will lift up your name (I will lift up your name)
Yahweh (I will lift up your name) Yahweh (I will lift up your name)
In the sweetest name of one love, the glory of one way
All creation stands to meet the author of eternity
All creation praise your maker's son
Lord my God, you are the one
Your way
Mountains rise and seas collide and you hold it all together
The one who is and always was
You love us like no other
Mountains rise and seas collide
And you hold it all together
The one who is and always was
You love us like no other
Mountains rise and seas collide
And you hold it all together
One who is and always was, love is like no other
Amazing love in the image of a God who reigns forever
