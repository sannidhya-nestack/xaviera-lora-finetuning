When I was young, I had a different, a different kind of faith
It was so innocent and pure
But now I've grown and found that my heart
Is not quite as it seems
The world is knocking at my door
My faith in peace is on the floor
When I look back at all the times that I should have been left for dead
Your hand was there, please tell me why (tell me why)
The sin in my heart gets me to the point I wish you'd leave me
And in those times I hear you cry
You tell me grace is not a lie
Oh, would you listen if I pray? (If I pray)
Would you heal me if I obey? (If I obey)
I sink in doubt, I live in fear
Can you reach me from here? (From here)
Can you reach me from here?
Sometimes I cannot tell the difference
Between peace and giving up
Let go of me, hold on to you
Hold on to you
Can I release the pain of my past and
Still learn from my mistakes?
I cry for dreams I thought were true
I want to live the vision through
Oh, would you listen if I prayed? (If I prayed)
Would you heal me if I obeyed? (If I obeyed)
I sink in doubt, I live in fear
Can you reach me from here? (From here)
From here (From here)
Can you reach me? (Can you reach me from here?)
Can you reach me from here? (Can you reach me?)
Can you reach me from here?
