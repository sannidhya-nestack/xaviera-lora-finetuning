That old green trunk of Mama's that we weren't allowed to touch
Daddy said it held the things that Mama loved so much
And someday we'd be old enough, my sister and myself
To have the few but very precious things that Mama loved
Mama's old green trunk didn't have that much to give
But the message Mama left inside has taught us how to live
To someone else I guess it might have looked like so much junk
But we found strength and hope and love in Mama's old green trunk
Just like kids my sis and I let curiosity
Get the upper hand we couldn't stand the mystery
Sis watched out the window from the highest corner bunk
With trembling hands I opened up our mama's old green trunk
Mama's old green trunk didn't have that much to give
But the message Mama left inside has taught us how to live
To someone else I guess it might have looked like so much junk
But we found strength and hope and love in Mama's old green trunk
I touched the colored patchwork quilt, not quite completely made
It was wrapped around a bible that has yellowed now with age
As I picked up the bible to see if there was more
A letter from our mama fell softly to the floor
My girls, my little angels, I wish I could have stayed
But I found out some time ago I'd have to go away
When life's so full of questions and problems everywhere
Read this holy bible, you'll find the answers there
Mama's old green trunk didn't have that much to give
But the message Mama left inside has taught us how to live
To someone else I guess it might have looked like so much junk
But we found strength and hope and love in Mama's old green trunk
The print is dim and faded now from years of constant use
Dog-eared pages tell the tale of what it's meant to us
We've underlined the scriptures just like our mama done
And when we need a helping hand we still know where to come
Mama's old green trunk didn't have that much to give
But the message Mama left inside has taught us how to live
To someone else, I guess it might have looked like so much junk
But we found strength and hope and love in Mama's old green trunk
Yes, we found strength and hope and love
In Mama's old green trough
