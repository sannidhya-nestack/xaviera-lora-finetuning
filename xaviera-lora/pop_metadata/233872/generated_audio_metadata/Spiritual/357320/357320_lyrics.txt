Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see so clearly
Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me
Hallelujah, all my stains are washed away
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me
Hallelujah, all my stains are washed away
We've no less days to sing your praise
Than when we first begun
Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me
Hallelujah, all my stains are washed away
Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me
Hallelujah, all my stains are washed away
Hallelujah, yeah
Hallelujah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Hallelujah, yeah
Hallelujah, yeah
