My life is so complete and my joy it never stops
He has filled my heart with love
This kind of love only comes from the Son above
Now I can go on
Since He's filled me with His Spirit
I've been singing this new song
Jesus makes me happy
He lives inside me
He leads and guides me
He don't deny me
Jesus makes me happy
He lives inside me
To lead and guide me
No he don't deny me
No more crying
And no more pains
When I get to heaven
In Jesus name
God will wipe all my tears away
Then I'll tell him thank you
For this blessed day
He'll ask what
Do you thank me for, for making me so happy
And giving me much more, I feel so good
He made me feel this way
All the days of my life I'm gonna sing
Jesus makes me happy
He lives inside me
He leads and guides me
He won't deny me
Jesus makes me happy
He lives inside me
To lead and guide me
No, He won't deny me
Jesus makes me happy
He lives inside me
He leads and guides me
He won't deny me
Jesus makes me happy
He lives inside me
To lead and guide me
No, He won't deny me
He's so wonderful
He's so wonderful (Jesus makes me happy)
Jesus makes me happy (He lives inside me)
Jesus (He leads and guides me)
Every day of my life (He lives inside me)
Jesus makes me happy (He lives inside me)
Jesus makes me, Jesus makes me, Jesus makes me so happy (He leads and guides me)
I've got to tell the world about it (He lives inside me)
That my happiness, you can't doubt it
I've been down before
But since I've met Jesus, I'm not sad anymore
I've got my head up high
Because nobody, nobody, nobody
Can do me like Jesus
He lives inside me (He's a friend)
To lead and guide me (He's so good to me)
No, He won't deny me (He's so good to me)
Jesus makes me happy
He lives inside me (He's a friend)
To lead and guide me
He won't deny me
Jesus makes me happy
He lives inside me
To lead and guide me
No, He won't deny me
