I can't make any sense out of the misery
Whatever the plan is, it's a mystery to me
I never prayed too hard to be released
I never felt such urgency to find some peace
And there are faint voices
Giving me choices
I think I know what I must do
So when I clench my fist in silent anger
Help me choose love
When I search for solutions and I get no answers
Help me choose love
When I'm beaten down by the enemy
Help me choose love
Cause I remember those things that have meaning to me
Help me choose love
Choose love
I wear my worries like a tragedy mask
Just for the simple truth is all I ask
Fate hasn't followed the road I paved
I pray that tonight that my soul can be saved
But the one thing I can change
Is the hardest to arrange
I know I must follow through
So when I clench my fist inside an anger
Help me choose love
When I search for solutions and I get no answers
Help me choose love
When I'm beating down by the enemy
Help me choose love
Cause I remember those things that have meaning to me
I remember those things that have meaning to me
So when I clench my fist in silent anger
Help me choose love
When I search for solutions and I get no answers
Help me choose love
When I'm beaten down by the enemy
Help me choose love
Cause I remember those things that had meaning to me
And now I'm faint voice and my hands wrapped fist in silent anger
Give me choices, could you help me choose the love
And the one thing I could change when I search for solutions and there's no answer
Is the hardest to break
Could you help me choose love
Never fade for a second
And I'm being taken down by the enemy
Giving me choices
Could you help me choose
And the one thing I can't change (I remember those things that are needed to me)
Is the hardest to erase (Could you help me?)
But you were the love (that I was waiting for)
And I'm beaten down by the enemy
Keepin' me choicey (could you help me)
Choose love
And the world did not come to me (I remember those things that are meanin' to me)
Who is the heart in the rain (could you help me)
Choose love
Choose love
'Cause our heart is through a rage
