Who shall come into the fullness of time
To gladden the hearts of men
Who shall bring new joy into the world
The poor and the lonely defend
Who shall come on a cold winter's night
When the world is hush and still
Only the silent stars keep watch
As the promise is fulfilled
Is fulfilled
We beheld His glory
And we have seen the light in His eyes
Now rejoice, Emmanuel has come to us
He's with us
The Word made flesh dwelt among us
Full of grace and full of truth
We beheld His wondrous glory
Of the only Son of God
His love gives freedom to captives
From His fullness we receive
Grace and grace and lasting mercy
Truth and wisdom, hope and peace
Hope and peace
We beheld His glory
And we have seen the light with us
Now rejoice, Emmanuel has come to us, is with us
Come, thou long-mistaken savior
Born to set thy people free
From our fears and sins release us
Let us find our rest in thee
We beheld His glory and we have seen the light in His eyes
Now rejoice Emmanuel has come to us
We beheld His glory and we have seen the light in His eyes
Now rejoice, Emmanuel has come to us, is with us
