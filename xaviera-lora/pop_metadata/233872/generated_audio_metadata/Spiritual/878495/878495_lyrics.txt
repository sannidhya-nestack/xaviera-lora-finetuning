You gave me strength when I hardly knew you
I never thought you'd show
You never gave up when I gave up on you
Seems I've never been alone
One tiny miracle is all I'll ever need
One tiny miracle
Made the world to me
You give me love
When I did not love you
That's the one that really gets to me
And you protected me
When I finally got down on my knees
What does this miracle mean?
One tiny miracle is all I'll ever need
One tiny miracle meant the world to me
One tiny miracle is all I'll ever need
