I took a step, I crossed the line
I gave you an hour at a time
And I trusted
Of all the promises you made
You kept your word, you gave me strength
And I trusted
I took a step, I crossed the line
It gave you an hour at a time
And I trust in you
Of all the promises you made
You kept your word, you gave me strength
And I trust in you
I took a step, I crossed the line
I gave you an hour at a time
And I trusted you
Of all the promises you made
You kept your word, you gave me strength
And I trusted you
I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I took a step, I crossed the line
I gave you an hour at a time
And I trusted you
Of all the promises you made
You kept your word, you gave me strength
And I trusted you
I took the step, I crossed the line
I gave you an hour at a time
And I trusted you
