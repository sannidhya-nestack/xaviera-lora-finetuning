I am amazed by the glory
I am in awe of your ways
You fill my soul so completely
I am secure, I am safe
Through all my life, I'm not alone
Your light will help me see
And when I can't walk on my own
Your grace will carry me
You lifted me up
I find myself right where I belong
Only you can bring me life
Like I've never known if to live
You are a fire of healing
You are a pillar of my being
Oh, I feel like singing and dancing
You are the song of my life
All the passions of my flesh
Have left me so alone
I look to you
To be my own master of my soul
You lifted me up
I find myself right where I belong
Only you can bring me life like I've never known
You lifted me up
I find myself right where I belong
Only you can bring me love like I've never known
You're lifting me up
Lifting me up
Oh, you're lifting me up
Oh, you're lifting me up
You're lifting me up
Oh, you're lifting me up
You're lifting me up
You're lifting
You're lifting me up
I find myself right where I belong
Only you can bring me life like I've never known
You lifted me up
I find myself right where I belong
Only you can bring me love like I've never known lifted me up
