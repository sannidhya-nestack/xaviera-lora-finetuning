Empty days and nights it wasn't right without you
Been again and again by the light I did not need you
You were never far away
You showed your grace
And love that day
I found you
These eyes are open
Now there's hope and a brand new day
I found you
It's getting nearer
Now that I'm nearer
It's a better way
Since I found you
Now that I know you, there's something new that's happening, oh yeah
My heart has been changed, life rearranged since I found you
To think I almost missed this love
All the joy I feel
Just because I found you
These eyes are open
Now there's hope and a brand new day
I found you
It's getting clearer
Now that I'm nearer
It's a better way
Since I found you
In good times and bad, you're always there
I have peace inside now, you're with me everywhere
I've found you, these eyes are open
Now there's hope and a brand new day
I've found you, it's getting clearer
Now that I'm nearer it's a better way
Since I've found you, these eyes are open
Now there's hope and a brand new day
I found you, it's getting clearer
Now that I'm nearer it's a better way
Since I found you (I found you)
I found you
