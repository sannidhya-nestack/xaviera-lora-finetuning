Be with me when I cannot speak your name
I'm choking in the pools of my despair
What if I cry and you're not really there
Is there a chance you'd love me just the same?
When I cannot speak your name
I keep your portrait in a gilded frame
That crucifix just mocks me from the wall
What if I'm really not your child at all
That terror has extinguished every flame
Till I cannot speak your name
What if I use my final breath to pray
And find you do not answer anyway
Will I only have myself to blame?
Or will you be there?
When I cannot speak your name
I hide my heart where none can reach
Can I not live this life I preach?
The well-worn pages burn
In the refuse of my fault
Was your book only made of paper after all?
What if my final chance already came?
What if my all is not enough?
If you should call me on this bluff
Still you'd find a way to bear my shame
That I cannot speak your name
What if I use my final breath to pray
Find you do not answer anyway
Will I only have myself to blame
Or will you be there
You're with me when I dare not
You're with me when I will not
You love me when I cannot speak
Your name
