From time to time I feel like the man upstairs doesn't care
My days are numbered by despair, if he's around then where
God has a way of always showing up
When you thought he was gone for good
God has a way of finding people
Right when they've given up finding themselves
God has his own timetable, darling
Sometimes he makes time fly
God has a way
A way that's all his own
Everyone knows that God is stranger
Than anyone can understand
God has a way of making people
Much more than they ever could be alone
God has his own timetable, darling
Sometimes he makes time fly
God has a way
As strange as it may seem
God is the end of me
We're all in a hurry
We want our prayers answered now
But sometimes the waiting
Is all that heaven will allow
Allow
There is a dream that'll never vanish
There is a dream that never dies
But I'm afraid I will never find it
Not till I learn how to see through his eyes
God has his own timetable, darling
Sometimes he makes time fly
God has a way
As strange as it may seem
God is the end of me
God has a way of finding people
God has a way, a way
