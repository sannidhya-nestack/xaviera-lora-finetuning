Something good is gonna happen
It's gonna happen
Right there in the dust
He sat by the gate
To listen to footsteps and patiently wait
The blind man just didn't dream
That this was the day
That Jesus of Nazareth would pass by his way
Something good is going to happen to you
Happened to you this very day
Something good is going to happen to you
Jesus of Nazareth is passing your way
She stood by the well, so tired and alone
Misfortune and heartache was all she'd ever known
She looked at the stranger, but who would ever think
Jesus to offer her living water to drink
Something good is going to happen to you
Happen to you this very day
Something good is going to happen to you
Jesus of Nazareth is passing your way
They were only wee children so happy at play
And told to stay quiet and out of the way
But then came the Savior with arms open wide
Their part of this kingdom made room by his side
Something good is going to happen to you
Happened to you this very day
Something good is going to happen to you
Jesus of Nazareth is passing your way
My friend if you're listening now humbly to me
And yes this is the moment that you can be free
This very same Jesus is right here today
Release your faith and touch him believe me when I say
Something good is going to happen to you (happen to you)
This very, this very day (Something good is going to happen to you)
Jesus on Nazareth is passing your way (Something good is gonna happen)
Something good is gonna happen (Something good is gonna happen)
Something good is gonna happen
