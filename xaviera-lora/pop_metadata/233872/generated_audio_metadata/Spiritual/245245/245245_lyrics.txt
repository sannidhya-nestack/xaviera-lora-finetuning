Thank God I can thank God
Either near or far from the church people or stars
I thank God I seek God I seek God
Like he's all I got all them new sneakers and cars
They gone rotten despite where I been though
He's still a friend yo holding on tight to my hand
Don't let go and I know there ain't no place don't
Show all of that everywhere our mission power he holds
Just give me your backpack and maybe twelve tracks
But first eternal life cause I know that's gone last
Then imma take them tracks and track across the map
Add it up and pass the mat to all that stand my path
Spain, Indonesia, to Africa
London, Brooklyn, Yugoslavia
Italy to Cali, Cuba, Canada
Jamaica's where it could take ya
Anywhere, thank God I can thank God
Near, far, thank God I can thank God
Anywhere, thank God I can thank God
Near, far, thank God I can thank God
Anywhere, thank God I can thank God
Near, far, thank God I can thank God
Anywhere, thank God, I can thank God
Near, far, thank God, I can thank God anywhere
I need a minute for my first amendment
I got a right to praise God
Pick him up, give him props and all that
He teaches the best classes
My study group and lab is all across the atlas
How in the world is he concerned with me?
There's over 7 billion others in the world but me
Picture this, you're here but he's everywhere
Thank God, I can thank God anywhere
Wait
