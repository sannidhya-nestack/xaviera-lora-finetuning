Under his wings, I am safely tucked inside
Nothing can get there, nothing but his grasp
Though the night deepens and tempests are wild
Still I trust him for I am his child
Under his wings
I will abide
Under his wings I find shelter, I find rest
What a refuge in my sorrows I am saved
There I'll hide until life's trials are gone
Evil cannot harm me there at all
Under his wings, I will abide
I will abide
Under his wings, what a precious joy divine
Blessed healing, blessed comfort
There I find, wrapped around in His everlasting arms
My soul in safety will avoid
And there is a wish, and there is a wish, I will obey
