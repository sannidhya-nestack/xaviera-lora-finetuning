Jehovah, Hallelujah
The Lord will provide
Jehovah, Hallelujah
The Lord will provide
Jehovah, Hallelujah
The Lord will provide
Jehovah, Hallelujah
The Lord will provide
The foxes have a hole
And the birds have a nest
The Son of Man
He doesn't know
Where to lay his weary head
Jehovah, hallelujah, the Lord will provide
Jehovah, hallelujah, the Lord will provide
The Lord will provide
