There's just no way to count the ways you loved me
How you'd soothe me every time I skinned my knee
Oh, I know now you had troubles all your own
Having you to guide me was my epiphany
Oh daddy, these memories never leave me
Oh daddy, in my soul you'll always be
On the night you died you left behind sad faces
But I gained a friend in high places
Yeah I gained a friend in high places
I remember how you tucked me in each night
And leave the door open a crack to let in some light
When I close my eyes I feel your spirit call
I guess death makes angels of us all
Oh daddy these memories never leave me
Oh daddy, in my soul you'll always be
On the night you died, you left behind sad faces
But I gained a friend in high places
In high places
Yeah, I gained a friend
High places, a friend in high
Places, ah, places, ah, places
