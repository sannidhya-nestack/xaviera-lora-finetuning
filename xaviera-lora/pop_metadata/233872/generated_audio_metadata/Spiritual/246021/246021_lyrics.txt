Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
Was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see
Through me
Many dangers, toils and snares I have already come
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home
Oh yeah
When we've been there 10 ,000 years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no
To sing God's praise than when we first begun
Than when we first begun
