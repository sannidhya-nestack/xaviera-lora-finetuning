There you stand, patiently
Asking me to open up the door to you
Spirit come
Live in me
There's nothing I want more than to be filled by you
Heaven, pour out your fire
Spirit, saturate me
I am yielding this life to your life within
Heaven, send down the rain
Let it saturate me
Jesus
Breathe in my life and breathe life again
Here am I, weak and lame
Let me taste the bread that can empower me
Spirit come
With the flame
Lord forever let your glory shower me
Heaven pour out your fire
Spirit saturate me
I am using this life
To your life within
Heaven send down the rain
Let it rain
Saturate me, Jesus, breathe in my life and breathe alive
Dry bones, dry bones, listen to the word of the Lord and come alive
Dry bones, dry bones, listen to the sound of the wind
That gives you breath again
Heaven, pour out your fire spirit, saturate me
I am yielding this life to your life within
Heaven, send down the rain, let it saturate me
Jesus, breathe in my life and breathe life (let it saturate me)
Jesus, breathe in my life and breathe life again (Breathe into me)
Breathe in me, breathe in me (Into me)
Spirit come, live in me
There's nothing I want more than to be filled by you
