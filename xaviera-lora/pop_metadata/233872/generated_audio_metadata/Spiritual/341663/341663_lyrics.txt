Ooh, yeah, yeah
Just two days ago
I hugged and kissed you
Told you that I loved you
I never knew
This would be the last time
I would ever see you
I would never see you
Again
Got a call this morning
Said you'd passed away
And as I was crying, your voice spoke to me
You said, "I'm alright, don't worry, I'm with the Lord of Lords"
"I'm with the King of Kings, all I can say, you will never ever be otten"
No, no, no, you will never ever be otten
No, no, no, you will never ever be otten
No, no, no, you will never ever be otten
You raised me up from the time I was a boy
Though I just lost my best friend
We'll meet again way up in the sky
With the Lord of Lords
With the King of Kings
All I can say
You will never ever be otten
No, no, no, you will never ever be otten
No, no, no, you will never ever be otten
No, no, no, you will never ever otten
Way up in the sky
With the Lord of Lords
With the King of Kings
All I can say
You will never ever be otten
No no no
You will never ever be otten
No no no
You will never ever be otten
No no no
You will never
Ever be otten
