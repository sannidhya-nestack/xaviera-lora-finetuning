Inside another doorway, a place to lay his head
A blanket of newspaper and a pillow of cobwebs
His pockets almost empty, business had been slow
All the open hearts and open hands
Had all gone off to Disneyland
It was time for him to go
Another town just like the last
Like sand through the hourglass
On Gypsy Road, millions journey
Some by choice, some by necessity
Jaded and confused with nothing left to lose
Making their own way down gypsy roads
For years she's been a nomad
Her days have been consumed
With searching for the band-aids
To nurse her open wounds
She scoured the self-help market
For a truth to light her way
And with every new philosophy
Came the promise of sincerity
But it always seemed to fade
Another fad but the same mistake
Euphoria that dies away
On Gypsy Road, millions journey
Some by choice, some by necessity
Jaded and confused with nothing left to lose
Making their own way down Gypsy Road
And along the way, the billboards light the sky
Their neon glow outshines the clues he's left behind
Those heavenly reminders
That we're not alone
The Lord is with us and wants to lead us home
On Gypsy Road, millions journey
Some by choice, some by necessity
But hold on to his promise that we are not alone
He's walking by our side to lead us home
