One light shines in every person One light shines in you and me
One light shines from inside everyone I see
It's the light that shines inside of me
One light binds us all together
One light shines from sea to sea One light shines in all those longing to be free It's the light that shines for unity
Joining hearts and hands
The light still shines in all around the world
Shining bright for all to see
It's shining bright in me, in me
One light brings us all together
One light inside you and me
One light shines in every person that I see
It's the light that shines inside of me
Years pass and friends will come and go
But in my heart love burns bright
One light keeps shining deep inside
And in this heart of mine
My love will shine
It's shining from one light
Shining from one light
