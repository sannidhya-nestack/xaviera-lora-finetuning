Yeah, do-do-do-do-do-do, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
You're rattling off of that Mr Stone Toe
He drives you crazy'cause he's ignorant and doesn't know
Did you ever stop to think that maybe you're the one
Who doesn't see the big picture?
You're pointing fingers now believers everywhere you turn
Throw your hands up and you wonder when they gonna learn
Did you ever stop to think that maybe you can start
With your own heart?
We can make this world a better place
But you gotta start with your own heart
Come on before it's too late (You gotta feel it)
If you really wanna see that kind of world (Every boy and every girl)
You gotta feel it (Bum and be that way)
You gotta feel it if you really wanna feel that kind
You gotta start with yourself and no one else
You gotta be that, be that way, yeah, ooh, ooh
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Mrs. Jones looks all alone in her living room
Ain't it a shame no one claims her and pretty soon
She'll be otten and no one in the family
Has any time to miss her
And then there's my girl who sits in her room all day
Her mama called her down for dinner but she ran away
Nobody knew her name at school
Won't anybody even miss her
We can make this world a better place
But you gotta start with your own heart
Come on before it's too late (You gotta be that)
If you really wanna see that
Kind of world (If you're born with it)
Every girl (You gotta be that)
Come on and be that way (You gotta be that)
If you really wanna feel that
Start with yourself and don't want to feel the beat of the beat of the beat of the beat of the beat of the beat of the beat of the beat of the beat of the beat of the beat of the beat of the beat of the beat of the beat of the beat of the beat of the beat of the Beat of the Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat Of The Beat
If you really wanna be that way (If you really wanna be that way)
If you really wanna see that kind of world (Every boy and every girl, you gotta be that way)
You gotta be that
If you really wanna feel that kind of love
Start with yourself and no one else
You gotta be that
Be that way
If you really wanna see that
If you really wanna feel it
Yeah, I know you wanna be that
Be that way
If you really wanna feel that
And no one else, you better be that, be that way, yeah
