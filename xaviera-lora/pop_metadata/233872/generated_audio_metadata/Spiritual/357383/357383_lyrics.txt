I suppose I don't know what you're going through
And I guess I can't know'til you tell me
Seems like the moon has it out for you
And the radio sounds like freedom
So sing, sing, sing, sing all your songs of pain
And make the most, survive all the hunger and shame
Today, beyond all the hurt and the pain
Is the one love that will stay and never fade
The pain is all the world will show
This is a song of hope
All of your life seems to never fly
Above what it is that you see
Wrap yourself warm, tomorrow's storm
Where can you find what you need?
And today, be gone all the hurt and the pain
Is the one love that will stay?
If pain is all the world will show
This is a song of hope
And it's far too far to go
For just one life
And it's far too far to walk
But if you could see inside the lies
And remove all the fear that now will blind your eyes
And today, beyond all the hurt and the pain
Is the one love that will stay and never fade
If pain is all the world will show today
Above all the hurt and the pain
Is the one love that will stay
Never fade
If pain is all the world will show
This is my song of hope
