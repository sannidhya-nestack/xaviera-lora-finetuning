I heard the voice of Jesus say
Come unto me and rest
Lay down, O weary one, lay down your head upon my breast
I came to Jesus as I was weary, worn, and sad
I found in Him a resting place
And He has made me glad
I heard the voice of Jesus say, "Behold, I freely give"
The living water, thirsty one
Bow down and drink and lift
I came to Jesus and I drank
Of that life-giving stream
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived
And now I live in him
I heard the voice of Jesus say
I am this dark world's guide
Look unto me, your morn shall rise
And all your days be bright
I look to Jesus and I found in him my star, my sun
And in that light of light I'll walk till traveling days are done
