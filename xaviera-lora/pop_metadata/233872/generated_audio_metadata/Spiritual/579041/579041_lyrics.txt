Here I am, this is me
What you get is what you see
Nothing extra, no frills
I work hard, I pay the bills
Don't got a fortune, don't need the fame
Inconspicuous, I could remain
All my faith in one man
I'm stress free, he handles everything
Sometimes I can't wait to get away from you
This whole crazy world I wanna run away
Just wanna run away (I wanna run away)
Just wanna run away
Sometimes I just feel like everything is chasing after me
So I just run away
I just run away yeah
I just run away
Run away yeah
So confused only sometimes
Supposed to be a simple life
Complications, tribulations
Got good intentions but it's revelations
The good book says it's the end of times
No other choice but to handle mine
Stay on my knees, no begging please
Just waiting for
When it comes for me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Sometimes I can't wait to get up (yeah)
Wait for the show (yeah)
Crazy (yeah) but I wanna (yeah)
I just wanna run away (I wanna run away)
I just wanna run away
Sometimes I just feel like everything is chasing after me
So I just run away (I just run away, yeah)
I just run away
Run away, yeah
Sometimes I can't wait to get away from this old crazy world
I wanna run away
Sometimes I just wanna run away (I wanna run away)
Sometimes I just wanna run away
Sometimes I just feel like everything
Is chasing at the beat so I just run away
I just run away yeah
I just run away
I just run away yeah yeah
