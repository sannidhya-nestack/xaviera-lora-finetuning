You are wonderful to me
You are wonderful to me
You are everything I need
You are beautiful to me
You are beautiful to me
You are everything I need
I will sing a beggar's song
Of all you've done
I will sing a sinner's song
Of your great love
I love to hear the words
That you're stronger than my sin
Though I don't deserve a promised land
You swear you'll let me in
I love to shout your grace
Like a prisoner set free
Though I ran so far away from you
Your grace has come to me
You are merciful to me
You are merciful to me
You are everything I need
How you persevere with me
How you persevere with me
You are everything I need
I will sing a beggar's song
Of all you've done
I will sing a sinner's song
Of your great love
And I love to hear the words
That you're stronger than my sin
Though I don't deserve the promised land
You swear you'll let me in
And I love to shout your grace
Like a prisoner set free
And though I ran so far away from you
Your grace has come to me
When I look for you (When I look for you)
You're everywhere I go (You're everywhere I go)
When I've lost my way (When I've lost my way)
You welcome me back home (You welcome me back home)
When I look for you (When I look for you)
You're everywhere I go (You're everywhere I go)
When I've lost my way (When I've lost my way)
You welcome me back home
And I love to hear the words that you're stronger than my sin
No, I don't deserve the promised land you swear you let me in
And I love to shout your praise
Like a prisoner set free
And though I ran so far away from you
Your grace has come to me
Your grace has come to me
