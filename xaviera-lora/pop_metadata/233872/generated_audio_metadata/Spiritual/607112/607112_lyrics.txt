Dear Lord, come into my life
I'm not living right
Come into my life
Only outside the world is cold as snow
Only inside is the me they'll never know
The wrong I've done, the sinner I am, Lord
Cleanse me like I know you can
My heart knows you, but the vanity in me ignores you
My heart yearns to live right, but there are times when I feel tempted
I say not tonight, dear Lord
See there's a sinner in me
I smile but there's no laughter
I don't wanna live my life in no disaster
I wanna be a light unto this world
See there's a sinner in me and I am so ashamed
I don't even deserve to call your name
Yet your love for me has never changed
Dear love, stop me in my tracks
Help me to not look back
God, no
On my path
Save me before it's too late
So that I may walk through Heaven's gate
My heart yearns to love you more
And the servant in me adores you
You've been so kind to me
I'll never turn my back on thee
I can't live without your aim
So let your righteousness proclaim
Dear Lord
See there's a sinner in me
I smile but there's no laughter
I don't wanna live my life in no disaster
I wanna be a light unto this world
See there's a sinner in me and I am so ashamed
I don't even deserve to call your name
Yet your love for me has never changed
It's never changed, oh no, no
Gotta let'em know, gotta let it show
Oh, I gotta let'em know, gotta let it show
Gotta let'em know, gotta let it show
I got to have you in my life, dear love
Gotta let'em know, gotta let it show
Everything I can't go on
Livin' this way, dear, oh
