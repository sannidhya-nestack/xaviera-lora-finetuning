There's a feeling that I can't control
And it comes from somewhere in my soul
That's where I go when this world is too much for me
And it's you I go to see
I don't care what trials I've been through
I'm no stranger to misery
And though I don't deserve your sympathy
Stay forever for me, oh Lord please
I'm not one to ask for favor
I'm not one to beg and plead
But I'll gladly get down on my knees
Stay forever for me, oh Lord please
Stay forever for me
Stay forever
For me
Lying out underneath the moonlight
Dreaming in the cool air of the night
Watching the stars shoot across the western sky
I have to catch my breath and sigh
At the wonder you've created
Your eternal majesty
When this world finally sets me free
Stay forever for me, oh Lord please
I'll spend my life just trying to serve you
I'll spend my time however you please
Cause only you know what it is I need
Stay forever for me, oh Lord please
Stay forever for me
Stay forever for me, please
Stay forever for me, stay forever
