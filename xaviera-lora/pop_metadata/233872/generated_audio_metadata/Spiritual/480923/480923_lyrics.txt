Every time I think I have my life all figured out
It takes me to a place I've never been
And when I finally think I know what life's about
It changes once again
But oh, this old road seems so familiar
Maybe what I'm looking for is up ahead
And then a voice
Echoes from the silence in my heart
And it tells me not to worry
That there's only one thing that I need to know
Deep in my soul
Every time I hear the voice
God is in control
Sometimes I barely hear the voice
And sometimes it is loud
But I always know He's there
Whether I'm alone or in the middle of a crowd
No further than a prayer
And so when my life looks like a circle
And I can't tell the beginning from the end
There comes a voice
It echoes from the silence of my heart
And it tells me not to worry
That there's only one thing I'll ever need to know
Deep in my soul
Every time you hear the voice
God is in control
How I need to hear his voice
Every moment of each day
I know I'll be okay, yeah, oh
'Cause every time you hear the voice
God is in control, oh
