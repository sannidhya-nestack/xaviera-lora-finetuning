Barely holding on tonight
And I need to lay it down before I drown
It's too much for me someway
Outside myself, well I know there's a light
Wings now upon my back, elevate my eyes
This love for all my life
For all my life
And I need
So lay it down before I drown
It's too much for me somewhere outside myself
I know there's light
And I need to lay it down before I drown
It's too much for me somewhere outside myself
I know that I need
To lay it down for I drown is too much for me
Somewhere inside your love I know that there's light
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
