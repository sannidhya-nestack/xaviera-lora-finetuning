Stretch out your hand and draw me closer to you
Your faithfulness is the bread that my soul feeds upon
Your spirit set me free from all the junk my heart believed
I love you Lord, you're beautiful, I love you Lord
You're wonderful, so beautiful, I can't comprehend your goodness
I love you Lord, you're beautiful, I treasure every veil that you remove
You show me, you guide me, how I love you
Your arms are wide open
Even when I don't deserve it
You always find a way to me
Even in my darkest hour
Show me more of your glory
I want to see more of who you really are, yeah
I love you Lord, you're beautiful, I love you Lord
So wonderful, so beautiful, I can't comprehend your goodness
I love you Lord, you're beautiful, I treasure every veil that you remove
You show me, you guide me, how I love you
I love you Lord, you're beautiful, I love you Lord
So wonderful, so beautiful, I can't comprehend your goodness
I love you Lord, so beautiful, I treasure every fail that you remove
You show me, you guide me yeah
I love you Lord, you're beautiful, I love you Lord
So wonderful, so beautiful, I love you Lord
I love you Lord, you're beautiful, I love you Lord
You're all I want to see
Through your eyes
Share your way with me
(You open my eyes)
(My eyes by revealing your love)
