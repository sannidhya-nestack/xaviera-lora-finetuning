The sound of laughter is only mocking
And eyes to stain your form
My sin like poison
Your willing drink
Remembering you broken
In body, in sorrow
Remembering your blood overflowing
I fall down unworthy of offerings so hallowed
But only for mercy, your mercy
I worship, I worship, I worship you Jesus
Incognite with mercy I worship
So brush with hyssop on my heart's doorway
The blood that ransoms souls
My cup of grace for your cup of shame
Remembering you broken in body, in sorrow
Remembering your blood overflowing
I fall down unworthy of offerings so hallowed
But only for mercy, your mercy
I worship, I worship, I worship you
Jesus in covenant with mercy
I worship, I worship, I worship
Jesus in covenant with mercy I worship
I fall down, unworthy
Of offerings so hallowed
But only for mercy
Your mercy
I worship
I worship You, Jesus, in covenant with mercy
I worship
I worship, I worship, I worship You, Jesus, in covenant with mercy
I worship, I worship, I worship you Jesus
In covenant with mercy I worship
