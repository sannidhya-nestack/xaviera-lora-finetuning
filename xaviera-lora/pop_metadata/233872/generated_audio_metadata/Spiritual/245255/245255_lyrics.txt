I am standing on the edge of the water
And I am watching the wild birds fill the sky
And I am longing to be lifted up
Among them
I am not dying
I'm getting ready
To fly
I am an old man and these old hands tell my story
Fifty years on the Boston Piers took their toll
Faded faces smile from those places I cannot return to
Till my days are done and they take me home
And I am standing on the edge of the water
And I am watching the wild birds fill the sky
And I am longing to be lifted up among them
I am not dying, I'm getting ready to fly
I was a young wife with my whole life still before me
It was the last year of the last great war
My darling Edward never returned from Normandy
But soon I will see my Edward once more
And I am standing on the edge of the water
And I am watching the wild birds fill the sky
And I am longing to be lifted up among them
I am not dying, I'm getting ready to fly
My memory is fading like an ember
But I remember a promise I once made
I said, "Dear Father, I'll be faithful forever"
And as he draws near me, he can hear me pray
I am standing on the edge of the water
And I am watching the wild birds fill the sky
And I am longing to be lifted up among men
I am not dying, I'm getting ready to fly
I am not dying, I'm getting ready to fly
