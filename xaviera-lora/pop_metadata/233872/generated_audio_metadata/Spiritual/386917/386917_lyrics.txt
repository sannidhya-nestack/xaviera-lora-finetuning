Frankly, dear Lord, I'm not ready to go
Don't wanna leave all the loved ones I know
Like a stream to the river, getting ready to row
Frankly, dear Lord, I'm not ready to go
Frankly dear Lord need a little more time
So many questions run around in my mind
There's so many valleys there's mountains to climb
Frankly dear Lord need a little more time
My dear Lord there's still so much to see
Dear Lord, my sweet Lord, there's so much to be
Frankly, dear Lord, I'm not ready to leave
All I'm asking is for one reprieve
Just to feel the sun and a gentle breeze
Frankly, dear Lord, I'm not ready to leave
My dear Lord, there's still so much to see
Dear Lord, my sweet Lord
There's so much to be
Dear Lord keep me on the tracks
Whatever you give I'll give you back
This train's still rollin' there's work to do
Before you take me back home
My dear Lord, there's still so much to see
Dear Lord, my sweet Lord, there's so much to be
There's so much to be, still so much to be
