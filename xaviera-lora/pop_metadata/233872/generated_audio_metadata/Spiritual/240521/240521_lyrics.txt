Is there still a little innocence
In this world or should we build a fence
Separating all the good from bad
It's one dream that all of us have had
Send me one ounce of energy
Shine through me like electricity
Be with me in synchronicity
Shock my jaded sensibilities
I don't know
Miners
No responsibility
Would you help a person in despair
Or ignore her like she wasn't there
Smiling faces bear the truth inside
Each one wonders what the other hides
Let's get back, get beasts and gems
Stabilize the planet in advance
Break down walls that stand between us now
Wipe away the fear and make a vow
I don't know why there's no responsibility, let me know
Am I right or wrong or in between
You know it's not too late to save the human race
But putting off today was no
Will surely kill tomorrow
I don't know why there's no responsibility
Let me know, am I right or wrong or in between?
You know it's not too late
To save the human race
But putting off today was no
Will surely kill tomorrow
No responsibility
Is there still a little innocence? (No, it's not just therapy)
Is there still a little innocence? (No, it's not just therapy)
Is there still a little innocence? (No, it's not just therapy)
Is there still a little innocence? (No, it's not just therapy)
Is there still a little innocence?
Is there still a little innocence?
