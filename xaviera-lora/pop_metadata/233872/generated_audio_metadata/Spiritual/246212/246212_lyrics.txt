You alone are the Lord our God
You have called our names and we are yours
You alone will deliver us
Righteousness reveals forevermore
Sing Hosanna to the King
Let the stones crash, the Savior comes
The answer to our plea
Sing Hosanna to the King
Freedom's light will shine for you and me
You alone are the Lord our God
You have called our names and we are yours
Oh, you alone will deliver us
Righteousness revealed forevermore
Sing Hosanna to the King, ah-ah-ah-ah
Let the stones cry out, the Savior comes
The earth stands to our plea, ah-ah-ah-ah
Sing Hosanna to the King
Freedom's light will shine for you and me
You alone, you are God (You are God)
You have called our names (You have called our names)
Sing Hosanna to the King
Let the stars cry out
The Saviour comes
The answer to our pleas, oh yeah
Sing Hosanna to the King (we will sing, we will sing)
Freedom's light will shine for you and me (for you and me)
Freedom's light will shine for you and me
