Great is your name and worthy to be praised
Great is your name and worthy to be praised
But all of our voices sing for you alone
Great is your name and worthy to be praised
Everyone will break into chorus
And every soul will bow down before you
You are king and you are God most high
God most high
Great are you God that you would save our lives
Trample our sins and open up our eyes
We breathe the life your grace has breathed in us
Great is your name and worthy to be praised
Everyone will break into chorus
And every soul will bow down before you
You are king, you are God most high
So fill this place with holy splendor
Fill our hearts so we always remember
You are king, you are God most high
God most high
All of our voices sing for you alone
Great is your name and worthy to be praised
Everyone will break into chorus
And every soul will bow down before you
You are king, you are God most high
So fill this place with holy splendor and fill our hearts so we always remember
You are king, you are God most high
Thank God most high
