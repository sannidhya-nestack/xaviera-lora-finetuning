Dad, I wonder what things are like in heaven
Did you walk through pearly gates on streets of gold
Did Jesus smile and welcome you to heaven?
Did He reach out His hand for you to hold?
Are you dancing round the throne with your loved ones gone before?
Are you helping Jesus build your mansion home?
Are you singing hallelujahs with the angels evermore?
Have you greeted all the friends you've ever known?
There is peace in heaven
Where Jesus reigns in majesty
We will live with Him in heaven
We will know His matchless love eternally
We will know His love eternally
Dad, I know that one day I'll be there in heaven
And we'll hold each other close just like before
Then you'll introduce me to the Lord of Heaven
And will worship at His feet forevermore
I am looking so forward to that day when I will see
The beauty of my Savior's face
I want to touch the scars that were born on Calvary
I want to feel His warm embrace
There is peace in heaven
Where Jesus reigns in majesty
We will live with Him in heaven
We will know His matchless love eternally
We will know His love eternally
But until my time
Or should Jesus come again to take us home? I will live in the power of Jesus Christ And I'll die for His glory
Alone there is peace in heaven
Where Jesus reigns in majesty
Live with Him in heaven
We will know His matchless love eternally
There is peace, there's peace in heaven
Where Jesus reigns in majesty
We will live
We'll live in heaven
We will know His matchless love eternally
We will know His love eternally
Dad, I wonder what things are like in heaven
