The mystery seems to be
How to change the way I see
How to finally let you in and keep my heart open
I try to live the best I can
But I've become a slave to man
And your otten son needs to be iven
Show me Jesus if you would
Our power's so misunderstood
And hold me high up to the sky
And help me believe again
When I was young my father held me high up to the sky
And it felt like I could fly
And I still believe
It made believe
Now I'm burdened by my heaven's moral weight
Enslaved by all my shiny earthly in-betweens
Imprisoned by my selfishness
How can I possibly be blessed?
Show me Lord what love and you mean
Show me Jesus if you would
A power so misunderstood
Hold me higher to the sky
Help me believe again
Help me believe again
Help me believe again
I tried to talk to you today
I wasn't quite sure how to pray or what to say
And so I sat there broken
Listening to you speak to me so unexpectedly
Then you came into my life
And turned the dark into light
Now I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe (And I believe) I believe, I believe (Yes, I believe) I believe, I believe, I believe (I believe) I believe, I believe
Show me Jesus if you would (I believe, I believe)
A power so misunderstood (I believe, I believe)
And hold me high up to the sky (I believe, I believe)
I believe again
I believe again
I believe again
Cause I believe again
Show me love, show me love, show me love
To what I need, what I love, what I've always dreamed of
Now with our new life just begun
And together we are one
