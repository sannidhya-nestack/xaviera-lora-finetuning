Jesus
Your blood was shed for me
How can I thank you
You came to set us free
Jesus
You were wounded for our transgressions
You were bruised
For our guilt and iniquity
Your body was broken
Your blood was shed for me
You've given us mercy
It's your blood that sets us free
Jesus
You said that kept us free
You are felt every pain
Every weakness you have carried to Jesus
The chastisement for our peace
With the stripes that wounded you
We are healed and made whole
Your body was broken
Your blood was shed for me
You bind up the broken
And your love makes us complete
Your body was broken
Your blood was shed for me
You were rejected and despised
You laid down your life for me
Jesus
You gently lead me beside still and restful waters
Jesus, your blood cleanses me from all unrighteousness
Jesus, you've paid the price for my salvation
And the iveness of sin
Your body was broken
Your blood was shed for me
Your body was broken
Your blood was shed for me
Your body was broken
Your blood was shed for me
Your body was broken
And your blood was shed for me
Thank you for your blood
That flowed upon the cross for me
Your love shows deep within you
Your sacrifice
Mmm
All the blood, all the blood, all the blood, all the blood
Shed for me
Mmm
Shed for me
Shed for me
Your blood is flowed for me
Thank you Jesus
Thank you Jesus
