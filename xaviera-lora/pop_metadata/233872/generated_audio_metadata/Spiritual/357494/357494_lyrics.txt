When my whole world feels like it's crashing down
And my belief in you is somehow buried in the ground
When I look in the mirror, I don't like who I see
I'm just a broken image of who I used to be
But then I see your love looking back at me
So I thank you for joy in the middle of a hurricane
You gave me a peace when I felt like I would go insane
If I didn't have you to turn to, where would I be?
And if I didn't know your name, who would save me?
I would be blown away, stuck in the middle of a hurricane
I don't wanna be lost inside
The night may howl, the wind may chill my soul
Oh, but this I know
Your love is my shelter from the cold
So I place my affection on all that is true
On my doubt and my worry
I just give to you
You hold my heart, my hand
In the palm of your hand
So I thank you for joy in the middle of a hurricane
You gave me a peace when I felt like I would go insane
If I didn't have you to turn to where would I be?
And if I didn't know your name who would save me?
I would be blown away
And no matter what, I'll be content
When I fall down, I get right back up again
It's time to get back to who I used to be
Before the fear began
Before the hurricane
If I didn't have you to turn to, where would I be?
And if I didn't know your name, who would save me?
I would be blown away
I would be blown away, I would be blown away
Stuck in the middle of a hurricane, stuck in the middle, yeah
Stuck in the middle, yeah, stuck in the middle
Of a hurricane stuck in the middle
I was stuck in the middle
So lost stuck in the middle
In a hurricane stuck in the middle
In a hurricane stuck in the middle
In a hurricane stuck in the middle
(Stuck in the middle) Oh yeah yeah
Come on! Ah!
Zup zup zup zup zup zup
Zup zup zup zup zup zup zup zup
Zup zup zup zup zup zup zup zup
Ooh yeah yeah yeah
Zup zup zup zup zup zup zup zup
Zup zup zup zup zup zup zup zup
Zup zup zup zup zup zup zup zup
Oh oh oh
In a hurricane
(Stuck in the middle) In a hurricane
I didn't know where I was going, no, no, oh yeah, yeah (Stuck in the middle, stuck in the middle, stuck in the middle)
In a hurricane
