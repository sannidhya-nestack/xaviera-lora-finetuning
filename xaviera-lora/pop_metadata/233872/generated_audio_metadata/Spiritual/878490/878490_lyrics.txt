Out of my bondage, sorrow and night
Jesus I come, Jesus I come
Into Thy freedom, into Thy light
Jesus I come to Thee
Out of my sickness into Thy help
Out of my wanting and into Thy will
Out of my sin and into Thyself
Jesus I come to Thee
Jesus I come, Jesus I come
Need a iveness, yeah
I come to thee in memory
The blood, the cross, the pain, the cost of grace
Out of my sinful failure and loss
Jesus I come, Jesus I come
Into the glorious gain of thy cross
Jesus I come to thee
Out of her sorrows into thy balm
Out of life's storms into thy calm
Out of distress into jubilant song
Jesus I come to thee
Jesus I come, Jesus I come
In need of iveness
I come to Thee, remembering
Jesus I come, Jesus I come
In need of Your mercy
I come to Thee, remembering
The blood, the cross, the pain, the cost of the rain
Out of my room, sin crucified
Into thy blessed will to abide
Remember forever the reason you died
Jesus, I come to thee
Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come
Need of iveness
I come to Thee
Remembering
Jesus I come
Jesus I come
Need of your sweet, sweet mercy
I come to Thee
Memory
Jesus I come
Jesus I come
Jesus I come
Jesus I come
The blood, the cross, the pain, the cost of grace
