He started his life in a stable with a cattle and sheep
Born to a humble family with not much to eat
His father on earth was Joseph, a carpenter by trade
God told Mary and Job and my son, and keep him safe
The son of a carpenter sent to save the world
And like an angel with a broken wing I follow his word
The son of a carpenter walked along this earth
And he gave us all he was worth
The son of a carpenter
He built me a road to heaven with his suffering and pain
His precious blood cleaned my soul till I was born again
He'll save every one of us if we just take his hand
And follow his shining light
To the promised land
The son of a carpenter
Sent to save the world
And like an angel with a broken wing I'll follow his word
The son of a carpenter walked along this earth
And he gave us all he was worth
The son of a carpenter
He spent his whole life doing good
Oh, but he wound up nailed to a cross of wood
The son of a carpenter sent to save the world
And like an angel with a broken wing
I follow his word
Mmm, the son of a carpenter
Walked along this earth
And he gave us all he was worth
The son of a carpenter
And I'm telling you for what it's worth
The son of a carpenter
