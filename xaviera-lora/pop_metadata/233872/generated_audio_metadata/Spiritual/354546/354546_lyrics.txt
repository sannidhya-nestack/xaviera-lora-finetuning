Take me home, Lord, I am ready
I lay down my earthly things
Though none go with me, I will follow
You have versed me
I'm a sinner, I am broken
Let my body turn to dust
Hear me cry, Lord, I'm not worthy
In your word I put my trust
Take me home
Take me home, take me home, take me home
Life is hard here, I'm not able to control my morals
With your blood you gave us hope Lord
With your life our hope was born
Take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home
