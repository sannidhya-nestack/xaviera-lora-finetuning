The sun, where did it go?
I'd like to know, is it hiding from me?
The stars are not in their place
And dimly they breathe
But when you hold my hand
I know that I can become all I am
And you remind me of how it should be
You've redefined me, yeah
I can't explain why
The harder I try
It comes back to you
So
I'm letting go
I want you to know
I'm starting new
When you hold my hand
I know that I can become all I am
And you remind me of how it should be
You've redefined me, yeah
You make me believe
In what I can't see
Some things so true
When my world falls apart
I'll trust in your heart
It's all I can do
When you
I know that I can become all I am
And you remind me of how it should be
You've reached me
Find me, yeah
