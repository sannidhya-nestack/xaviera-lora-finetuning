You love me despite me I keep pushing you away
So far away that I can hardly hear you
And happiness, oh they say
Is just another prayer away
Help me find the words to speak
To you, the only one I'll ever need
And I'm longing for home
Is there a mansion there for me?
And I'm longing for home
I'll take a shack
I wanna get back where I belong
Back in my savior's arms
And all I wanna do is get back to when I first believed
The story has no end
I'm back within my savior's arms again
Your spirit remains with me everywhere I go
I feel it every time you tug my heart strings
Through confusion's misty haze
Your light is hard to see these days
To know what love is
Will you show me the way love's supposed to be
And I'm longing for home
Is there a mansion there for me
And I'm longing for home
I'll take a shack
I wanna get back where I belong
Back in my savior's arms (in my savior's arms)
And all I wanna do is get back to when I first believed (I wanna get back)
The story has no end
I'm back within my savior's arms again (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I wanna get back, I wanna get back to you, back to you
Back within my savior's arms, the only place that I belong
Surrounded in your love, and in your light I find my home
And I'm longing for home
I wanna get back where I belong
Back in my savior's arms
All I wanna do is get back to when I first believed
And all I wanna do is get back to when I first believed
All I wanna do is get back to when I first believed
Yeah the story has no end
Still I'm back within my savior's arms again
