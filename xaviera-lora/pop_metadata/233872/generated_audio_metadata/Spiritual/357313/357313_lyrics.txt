As we gather now we remind ourselves of what we do
That these songs are not just songs but signs of love for you
As we gather now we remind ourselves of what we do
That these songs are not just songs but signs of love for you
This is a holy moment now
Something of heaven touches earth
The voices of angels all resound
And we join their song
Come, come, come
Let us worship God with our hands
Hands held high and our hearts bowed down
We will run, run, run through your gates, oh God
With a shout of love, with a shout of love
Lord with confidence as we come before your throne of grace
Not that we deserve to come but you have paid the way
And this is a holy moment now
Something of heaven touches earth
The voices of angels all resound and we join their song
Come, come, come, let us worship God
With our hands held high and our hearts bowed down
We will run, run, run through your gates, oh God
With a shout of love, with a shout of love
Come, come, come, let us worship God
With our hands held high and our hearts bowed down
We will run, run, run through your gates, oh God
With a shout of love, with a shout of love
