Come ye sinners, poor and needy
Weak and wounded, sick and sore
Jesus ready stands to save you
Full of pity, love and power
Come ye thirsty, come and welcome
God's free bounty, glorify
True belief and true repentance
Every grace that brings you nigh
I will rise and go to Jesus
He will take me in his arms
In the arms of my dear Savior
Oh there are ten thousand charms
Let not conscience make you linger, nor fitness
By my dream, all the fitness he required
Is to know your need of him
Come ye weary, heavy laden
Lost and ruined by the fall
If you tarry to your bedder
You will never come at all
I will rise and go to Jesus
He will take me in his arms
In the arms of my dear Savior
Oh, there are ten thousand charms
