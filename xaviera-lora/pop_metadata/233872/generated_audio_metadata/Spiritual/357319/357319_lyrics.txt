You are God in heaven
And here am I on earth
So I'll let my words be few
Jesus, I am so in love with you
And I'll stand in awe of you
And I'll let my words be few
Jesus, I am so in love with you
The simplest of all love songs
I want to bring to you
So I'll let my words be few
Jesus, I am so in love with you
And I'll stand in awe of you
And I'll stand in awe
Yes, I'll stand in awe of You, Jesus
Yes, I'll stand in awe of You
And I'll let my words be few
Jesus, I am so in love
Jesus, I am so in love
Jesus, I am so in love with you
