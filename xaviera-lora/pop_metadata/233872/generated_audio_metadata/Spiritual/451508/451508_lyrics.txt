Everything is going wrong
And you feel like you can't go on
Look to your left and your right
But there's not a single friend in sight
Your whole world is tumbling down
And there's no love to be found
That's just the kind of situation
That my God understands
Because He's got enough love
He went and died for us all
He's got enough love
You know
He picks us up when we fall
He's got enough love
He's got enough love to make everything okay
That's why I'm counting on him every day
Pour yourself another drink
Solve your problem or so you think
When daylight comes around
The same problem will still be found
And every little step you take
Is your least and more heartache
That's just the kind of situation
That my God understands
Because He's got enough love
He's got another love
He went and died for us all
He's got another love
And you know
He'll pick us up when we fall down
He's got another love
More than enough love
To make everything okay
That's why I'm counting on him every day
Just think, someone who died for you, what else won't they do?
Because he's got enough, he's got enough
He wouldn't die for us all, he's got enough
And you know, he'll bring us up when we fall down (He's got enough love)
More than enough love to make everything okay
That's why I'm counting on him, counting on him each and every day, yeah
(He's got enough love) oh, he's got enough
He'll be winning down for us all (He's got enough love)
And you know, your fingers up when we fall (He's got the way down)
He's got enough, to make anything okay
That's why I'm counting on him everyday
Darling say, he's got enough love, he's got enough
He wouldn't die for us all, he's got enough love
And you know, he'd fix us up and move on
He's got enough love, much more than enough
To make everything okay
