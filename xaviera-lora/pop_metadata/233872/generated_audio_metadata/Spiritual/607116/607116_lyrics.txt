I've got a home in glory land
That outshines the sun
I've got a home in glory land
That outshines the sun
I've got a home in glory land
That outshines the sun
Way beyond the blue
Do Lord, oh do Lord
Do Lord remember me
Do Lord, do Lord, do Lord remember me
Do Lord, oh do Lord, oh do Lord remember me
Way beyond the blue
I took Jesus as my savior, you take him too
Well, I took Jesus as my savior, you take him too
I took Jesus as my savior, you take him too
Way beyond the view
Oh, do Lord, oh, do Lord
Do Lord remember me?
Well, do Lord, oh, do Lord
Do Lord remember me?
Yes
Do Lord, do Lord, do Lord remember me, oh
Way beyond the blue
Way beyond, way beyond the blue
