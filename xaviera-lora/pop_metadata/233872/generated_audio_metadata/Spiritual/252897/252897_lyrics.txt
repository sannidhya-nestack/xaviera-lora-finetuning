Vegging out to the daytime dish
Early to bed and late to rise
You play your part in the movie of the week
So you don't have to play your own
You sink deeper, falling faster
Call out before you drown
Do you dare, dare to feel, face what is real, open wide, open up, to the one who heals
So many times you failed the test
Lost all the will to try again
So you sell your soul to the latest talk show queen
So you don't
Have to think at all
You sink deeper
Falling faster
Reach out before you drown
Do you dare, dare to feel
Face what is real
Open wide, open up
To the one who heals
Bottled up
Fighting through the fog
To interrupt
This mangled dialogue
Scratch and claw
Your way up to the surface
Pass the pain and anger
To a purpose
Do you dare, dare to feel
Face what is real
Open wide, open up
To the one who heals
Do you dare, dare to feel
Face what is real
Open wide, open up
To the one who heals
To the one who heals
He is the one who heals
