All day long I put my hope in you
All day long I put my hope in you
You're the one who puts me on the path I need to be
All day long I put my hope in you
All day long I place my faith in you
All day long I place my faith in you
You're the one who's working on a special place for me
So all day long I place my faith in you
Show me the road I need to follow
Point out the path that I should walk
Lead me by your truth and teach me
For you are the God who saves and loves me
All day long I put my trust in you
All day long I put my trust in you
You're the one who blows my boat across raging sea
So all day long I put my trust in you
Show me the road I need to follow
Point out the path that I should walk
Lead me by your truth and teach me it
For you are the God who saves and loves me
All day long I give my love to you
All day long I give my love to you
You're the one who takes my love and gives more back to me
So all day long I give my love to you
All day long I give my love to you
All day long I give my love to you
