Take a little love and pass it on
Take a little trust and pass it on
You can't sell it, you can't buy it
But it's free if you wanna try it
Come on and take a little love
And pass it on (pass it on)
When someone does you a kindness
Don't stop to ask him why
Just say thanks my friend and then pass it on
Things you do to help your brother
He might do unto another
So take a little love and pass it on (pass it on)
Pass it on (pass it on)
Start a season of rebirth
Don't let prejudice and hatred
Interfere with peace on earth
Show your fellow man you care
Kneel and join him in a prayer
Love was meant for us to share
So pass it on
Take a little love and pass it on
Yes, take a little trust and pass it on
We may have different colored skins
But you could color us as friends
If we'd just take a little love
And pass it on (pass it on)
When someone gives you the credit
For all the good things you have done
Chances are you had some help from one or two
Very few things are accomplished if you have to work alone
Take your credit where it's due and pass it on
Pass it on
Pass it on and hear my story
I don't care who gets the credit
Long as the good Lord gets the glory
There's so much good we can do
If it didn't matter who got that credit
So take yours and pass it on
Take a little love and pass it on
