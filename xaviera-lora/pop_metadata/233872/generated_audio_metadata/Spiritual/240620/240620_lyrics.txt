Don't you know that you must look within
To see the truth
As a child we learned to accept most people just the way they are
And as we grow older we begin to learn that they're not who they seem
And you should never take for granted what you have cause you may be
Surprised to find out the only thing you have is on your feet
Reality
Reality
Reality
Oh, oh, oh
Have you ever seen the sunset stretch across an open shore?
The oceans and the birds that fly across a sky full of love and war
And peace is the only thing we had to fight for to the very end
And for the love of God we should always ask for
iveness of our sins
Reality
Reality
Reality
Reality
Reality
Reality
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
