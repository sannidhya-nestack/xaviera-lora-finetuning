Looking to the west
Clouds build over red sunset
I can smell the rain (I can smell the rain)
Hear the cry of a far away train
Now I know
People find it hard to believe
But I know there's a plan for all that I see
Life's a long, long highway
Sometimes a rocky road
Even when it's raining
Oh no, I'll never be alone
It isn't hard to find
This love I know that gives me peace of mind
No matter where I roam (no matter where I roam)
It would stray away, I can always come home
Now I know why an eagle has fire in his eye (fire in his eye)
And I know there's a reason why life lives and dies
'Cause life's a long, long highway
Sometimes a rocky road
Even when it's raining
Oh no, I'll never be alone
I'll never be alone
God will always be there for you
If you ever need a friend
Don't let one day pass by
He'll never be here again
Now I know sometimes it's gonna be hard to find the way
But I know
All I gotta do is pray
Oh God I pray
There's lots of long long highway
Sometimes a rocky road
Even when it's raining
Oh no I'll never be alone
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Ooh, I'll never be alone
You know I'll never be alone
Never, never, never be alone
Oh, never be alone
Never, never, never be alone
God is always here for you
Never be alone, never, never, never be alone, never be alone, never, never, never be alone
