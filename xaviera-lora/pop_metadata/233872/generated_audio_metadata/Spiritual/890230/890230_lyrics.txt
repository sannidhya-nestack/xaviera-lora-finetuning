Here is love that stays the ocean
Love in kindness has the flood
When the prince of life our ransom
Shed for us his precious blood
Who his love will not remember
Who can cease to sing His praise?
He can never be otten
Throughout hell's eternal days
On the mountain
Fountains open, deep and wide
Through the floodgates of God's mercy
Flow the vast and deep
Grace and love like mighty rivers poured incessant from above
And heaven's peace and perfect justice kissed the guilty world in blood
Let me all thy love accepting
Love thee ever all my days
Let me see
Thy kingdom only and my life be to Thy praise
Thou alone shall be my glory nothing in the world I see
Sent to fight me
Thou thyself has set me free
Thou alone shall be my glory
Nothing in
The world I see
Thou hast cleansed and sanctified me
Thou thyself has set me free
