Praise to the maker of rivers and streams
Praise to the master and maker of dreams
Praise to the builder of mountains so tall
Praise to the master and maker of all
Praise to his singing, the mockingbird fair
Praise to his dancing, the bronze back in air
Praise to his creatures, the great and the small
Praise to the master
And maker of all
Praise to the Master
And maker of all
Praise to His satin
And lake when it's still
Praise to His blanket
Of snow on the hill
Praise to the antelope, the swiftest of swift
Praise to the wildcat, alone and adrift
Praise to the hood out that echoes his call
Praise to the master and maker of all
Praise to the master and maker of all
Praise to the master and maker of all
