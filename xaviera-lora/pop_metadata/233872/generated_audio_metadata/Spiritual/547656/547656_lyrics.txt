I am a fool, I am a child
I keep going back to you in spite of all the pain
I said goodbye, I walked away
So why am I still locked within these chains
Meeting you, dreaming you, wanting you more
To feel so frail, it's humankind
To search for what you know you cannot find
It's not about what's good and bad
But all about the choice I thought I had
And needing you
Dreaming you
Wanting you more
Ironic but the more I try to take my mind away
The more I realize
Nothing can take your place
Needing you
Dreaming you
And wanting you more
Needing you more
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
