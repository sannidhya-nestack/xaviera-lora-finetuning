Created in your image, from heaven's point of view
You made us all so different, and yet we're just like you
You know us best, yet love us most
Imperfect works of art
Others see the outer shell
But you know us by heart
You called us good
You called us good
You felt our every pain, so we know you understood
You filled our world with signs of you, gave us the strength to make it through
Brought peace into our lives no other could
You looked on all you made
And called us good (you called us good)
(You called us good, you called us good)
When anger and rejection come at us undeserved
And life's unfairness whispers that justice can't be served
When might makes right and we are feeling cold and battle-scarred
Remind us through the conflict we've otten who we are
You called us good (You called us good)
You called us good
You felt our every pain so we'd know you understood
Then filled our world with signs of you
Gave us the strength to make it through
Brought peace into our lives, no other could
You looked on all you made and called us good (you called us good)
You taught us by example what it means to be a friend
So when we look through your eyes we start to comprehend (you called us good)
You called us good
You felt our every pain, so we know you understood
Then filled our world with signs of you
Gave us the strength to make it through
Brought peace into our lives, no other could
You looked on all you made and called us good (you called us good)
You looked at all of us and called us good
