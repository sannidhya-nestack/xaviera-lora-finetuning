We have separated our hearts from you
Who will show your mercy and speak your truth?
Capture us again
Our shattered lives to mend
Oh how we need you
Oh how we need you
May your spirit
Fall upon us, teach us
That we may be made holy
And love like you have loved
Let your presence
Dwell among us, clean us
And make us into people
Who live to bring you praise
Restore us to your wisdom and make us new
Teach us to love mercy and speak in truth
Capture us again
Our shattered lives to mend
Oh how we need you
Oh how we need you
May your spirit
Fall upon us
Teach us
That we may be made holy
And love like you have
Let your presence dwell among us, clean us and make us into people who live to bring you praise
May your spirit fall upon us
Teach us that we may be made holy
And love like you have loved
Let your presence dwell among us
Clean us and make us into people
Who live to bring you praise
