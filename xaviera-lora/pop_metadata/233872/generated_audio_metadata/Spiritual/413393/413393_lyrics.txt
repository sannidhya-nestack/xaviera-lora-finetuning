Sing over me, your serenade of faithfulness
Sing over me, your song of joy, your words that bless
Cause it's like you Lord to give me hope
And it's like you Lord to bless my life
And it's like you Lord to fill me with your song
Sing over me the sweetest song my ears have heard
Sing over me and cleanse my soul with every word
Cause it's like you Lord to give me hope
And it's like you Lord to bless my life
And it's like you Lord to fill me with your song
Now I hear the sound of your melody
I can feel your love consuming me
It's better than it's ever been before
You have saved my life
You have changed my name
You have poured your goodness out like rain
And now your song is all I'm listening for
Sing over me your serenade of faithfulness
Sing over me
Your song of joy
Your words that bless
Cause it's like you Lord to give me hope
And it's like you Lord to bless my life
And it's like you Lord to fill me with your song
Now I hear the sound of your melody
I can feel your love consuming me
It's better than it's ever been before
You have saved my life
You have changed my name
You have poured your goodness out like rain
And now your song is all I'm listening for
Now I hear the sound of your melody
I can feel your love consuming me
It's better than it's ever been before
You have saved my life
You have changed my name
You have poured your goodness out like rain
And now your song is all I'm listening for
So sing over me
Sing over me
Sing over and over, sing over me
Sing over and over, sing over me
Sing over and over, sing over me
And over, and over
Sing over me
Sing over me
Sing over me
Sing over me
