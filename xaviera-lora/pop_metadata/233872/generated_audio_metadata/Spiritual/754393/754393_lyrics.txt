All the souls in rhythm who are dancing to the beat
You feel the rhythm in the streets and all around
Now you know that my mind is rest assured
I believe in so much more I finally found the light
Love will end it show me the way
And now I am here today
I'm here today to say
All the souls in rhythm who are dancing to the beat
Feel the rhythm in the streets
And all the rest
All the souls in rhythm who have finally found the light
To uphold all that's right for humankind
Go ahead and tell your way
You are entitled to what you say
But I do not have to believe
I have heard all of this before
And now I've come to ignore
Anything but truth and light and peace
All the souls in rhythm
Who are dancing to the beat
They feel the rhythm in the streets
And all the rest
All the souls in rhythm who have finally found the light
To uphold all that's right for humankind
Ever after, ever after
Ever after, ever after, ever after
Ever a star, ever a star
