And I don't need to see you up on top of water
And I don't need to hear you call Lazarus, "Rise"
And I don't need to touch the hem of your garment
Oh, I believe
I believe
I believe you were crucified and on the third day rose again
I believe you were sacrificed for blood spilled for my sins
I believe
Jesus, I believe (I believe)
I don't need to see you turn water into wine
And I don't need to see it in a crowd healing the lame and the blind
And I don't need to see the light shine through the holes in your hands
I believe
I believe
I believe you were crucified and on the third day rose again
I believe you were sacrificed and blood spilled for my sins
I believe (I believe) Jesus
I believe (I believe) I believe (I believe) I believe
I believe (I believe) I believe (I believe)
I believe you were crucified on the third day rose again
I believe you were sacrificed with blood spilled for my sins
I believe (I believe) Jesus
I believe (I believe)
Jesus, I believe (I believe)
I believe you were crucified and on the third day rose again
I believe you will sacrifice your blood spilled for my sin
I believe, Jesus, I believe, Jesus, I believe, Jesus,
I believe, Jesus, I believe
I believe, I believe
