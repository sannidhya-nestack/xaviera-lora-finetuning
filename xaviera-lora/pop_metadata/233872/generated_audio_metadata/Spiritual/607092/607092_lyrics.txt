These four walls, they look familiar
This room hasn't changed, it still looks the same
It seemed like only yesterday when I cried out to you, Lord
Now I'm back on my knees in the same old place
Asking for your love and grace
Seems like I've been here before
These floors feel familiar, I'm on my knees again
Calling out your name, feeling like a doctor in pain
And only you lord can prescribe the medicine
To cleanse my soul within
Only you have the cure
At times life hasn't always been easy
But Lord with all my heart I want to please Thee
Sometimes life can be like a whirlwind
As it takes you on a spin
But lord I wanna live right
So here am I back on my knees tonight
Seems like I've been here before
These floors feel familiar
I'm on my knees again
Calling out your name, feeling like a doctor in pain
And only you, Lord, can prescribe the medicine
To cleanse my soul within, only you have the cure
Yeah, oh
Mmm, I've been here before
These floors feel familiar
Said I'm on my knees in the same old place
Calling out your name
Feeling like a doctor in pain
And only you Lord, and only you Lord can prescribe the cure
I've been here before
Said I've been here before
Sit on my knees in front of my bed
Said I've been here before
Calling out your name
I'm feeling like a doctor in pain
And only you lord have the cure
Oh lord, I've been here before
