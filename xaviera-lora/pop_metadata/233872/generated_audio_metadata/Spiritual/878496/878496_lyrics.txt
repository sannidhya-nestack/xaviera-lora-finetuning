All creatures of our God and King
Lift up your voice and with us sing
All praise Him, Hallelujah
Thou burning sun with golden beams
Thou silver moon with softer gleams
Oh, praise Him, oh, praise Him
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Thou rushing wind that art so strong
And ye clouds a sail in ever long hope raising
Thou rising moon in praise rejoice
Near lights of evening find a voice
Oh praise Him, oh praise Him
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
All praises to our God in King
Let all things their Creator bless
And worship Him in humbleness
All praise His Hallelujah
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son
And praise the Spirit
Oh, praise Him, praise Him
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Love me now
All praises to our God in King
