Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
This great, that brought me safe
Whose far and grace will lead
The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures
As long as life endures
Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fade
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess within the vein
A life of joy and peace
When we'll be there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun
