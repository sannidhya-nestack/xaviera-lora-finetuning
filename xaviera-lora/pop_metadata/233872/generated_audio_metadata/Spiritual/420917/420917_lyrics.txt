Ride that train, train to glory
Ride that train, glory train
In a short little season I'll be gone from here
Catching the train that leads me to where
There will be no more sorrow, no more trouble there
Let the Lord set the course, destination clear
Gonna ride, salvation train
Gonna ride, salvation train
Gonna ride with my savior through the morning sky
Gonna ride, ride, ride, Salvation Dre
I was thrown in the middle of a tempest storm
Left there for dead, lost and forlorn
Then my sweet Jesus saved me and I was reborn
And now just a little while
Until I hear the whistle, hear the whistle sound
Salvation train gonna ride
Salvation train
Gonna ride with my savior through the morning sky
Gonna ride, ride, ride
Salvation train
Glory train is coming soon
You will not be left alone (you will not be left alone)
He's sent love one glorious journey
He's come to take his children home (take them home)
When the train leaves the station, will you take that ride?
You gotta believe in the Lord with all of your might
There's no charge for the ticket, Christ has paid the price
So get up and on and ride by the Master's side
Gonna ride, ride, ride, salvation train
Gonna ride, ride, ride, salvation train
Gonna ride, ride, ride, salvation train
Gonna ride, ride, ride, salvation train
