The earth was formless
Darkness and emptiness prevail
That was the way it was
Before you spoke words of life
Yes, you were Lord alone
For you have created heavens and all their hosts
The earth and all that is in it
The sea and all that lives in it
So I'll stand up and bless the Lord, my God, my King
From runnin' last into everlastin'
Let Your glory be all over the earth
For Your steadfast love is higher than the heavens and
Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds
Blessed be your name
Lord, most high, I worship you
Lord, most high, I honor you
My heart was formless
Darkness and emptiness prevail
That was the way it was
Before you spoke words of life
Yes, you will, Lord, Lord
For you have iven my many sins
And as far as the East is from the West
You've tossed them in the sea of etfulness
So I stand up and bless the Lord my God my King
From everlasting to everlasting
Let Your glory be all over the earth
For you're stiff as love is higher than the heavens and
Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds
Blessed be your name
Oh much high I worship you
Learned much that I ignore you
Awake my soul, awake my soul, unseen
Awake my soul, awake my soul, unseen, yeah yeah
La-i-la-i-ra, la-i-ra
So I'll stand up and bless Thee, Lord my God, my King
From everlasting to everlasting
Let Your glory be all over the earth
For You stand first, love is higher than the heavens and
Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds
O Most High, I worship You
Lord Most High, I honor You
Lord most high I worship you
Lord most high I honor you
