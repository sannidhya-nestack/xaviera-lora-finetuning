We sing of your mercy and your unending love
We sing of your faithfulness and your grace to us
We sing as loud as we can, louder than the world
We sing of your beauty, of this unfailing peace
We sing of your righteousness and the strength to see
We sing as loud as we can, louder than the world
And your glory fills this place today
With the sound of all your people's praise
Our voices gladly sing along
Join in heaven's song that you are the living king of days
We sing of your favor, of this abundant life
We sing of your patience, Lord, with voices lifted high
We sing as loud as we can, louder than the world
And your glory fills this place today
With the sound of all your people's praise
Our voices gladly sing along
Join in heaven's song that you are the living king
We sing of our hunger and our poverty
We sing of our broken chains, how you set us free
We sing of your whisper of love, how it's louder than the world
We sing of your whisper of love
And how it's louder than the world
Louder than the world
And your glory fills this place today
With the sound of all your people's praise
Our voices gladly sing along
Joyed in heaven's song that you are the living king of days
And your glory fills this place today
With the sound of all your people's praise
We sing of your mercy and your unending love
We sing of your faithfulness and your grace to us
And we sing as loud as we can, louder than the world
If we sing as loud as we can, louder than the world
