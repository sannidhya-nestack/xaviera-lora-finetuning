They ask me if I continue to trust him
Although I don't know how he will take care
Well I said yes, still I'm sure he's doing it his own way
I will listen and I will obey
I will listen and I will obey
I will listen and I will obey
I will keep on, I live by faith not by sight
Even if some goals might be unreachable
So lay your burden down, enjoy the life load
Keep the faith and say, I will keep on
My foundation is Christ, the Savior is risen
He's on His way to all the saints on earth
He won't return to pick up the pieces
No, He will endure, He'll return to take us home
He will return to take us home
One day he's coming back and I will keep on
I live by faith not by sight
One day the Lord is coming back, that's what the Bible says
So lay your burden down (right now) and join the light, oh
Keep the faith (it's gonna pick up the believers)
I will keep on, I will keep on
I live by faith not by sight
One day the Lord is coming back, that's what the Bible says
So lay your burden down, enjoy the light's glow
Keep the faith, it's gonna pick up the believers
I will keep on, I live by faith not by sight
So lay your burden down
Enjoy the life, oh
Keep the faith
Sing it one more time, hey, hey, hey, hey
We're living by bread not by time (I live by faith not by sound)
So lay your burden down (So lay your burdens down)
There's light on the minds today (Enjoy the light though)
Keep the faith (Listen, hmm)
I will keep on
