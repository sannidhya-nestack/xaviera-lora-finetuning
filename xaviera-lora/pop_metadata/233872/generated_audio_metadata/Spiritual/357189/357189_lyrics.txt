Oh Lord my God, in you I put my trust
Oh Lord my God in you I put my hope
Oh Lord my God in you I put my trust
Oh Lord my God in you I put my hope
In you
In you I find my peace
In you I find my strength
In you I live and move and breathe
Let everything I say and do be founded by my faith in you
I lift up holy hands and sing, let the praises ring
Oh Lord my God, to you I give my hands
Oh Lord my God, to you I give my feet
Oh Lord my God, to you I give my everything
Oh Lord my God, to you I give my life
Can you
In you, in you I find my peace
In you, in you I find my strength
In you, I live and move and breathe
Let everything I say and do
Be founded by my faith in you
I lift up holy hands and sing
Let the praises ring
Oh Lord
Let the praises ring
Oh Lord
Mmm yeah
Let the praises ring
Let the praises ring
In you, in you, I find my peace
In you, in you, I find my strength
In you, I live and move and breathe
Let everything I say and do be founded by my faith in you
Let everything I say and do be founded by my faith in you
Let everything I say and do be founded by my faith in you
I lift up holy hands and sing
Let the praises ring
Let the praises ring
Let the praises ring
Let love praise
As me
