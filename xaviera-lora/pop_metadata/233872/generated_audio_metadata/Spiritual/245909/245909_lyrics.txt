Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Tender intimate praise
Nothing more I want to say to you
Just show your face eventually
And tell you how much you mean to me
You are more than light to me
You have suddenly set me free
Light of the world
Shine your light on me
Oh my light, lighthouse
She and you last
Every day I need your grace
We need your love to fill up this place
My world has transformed
And it's through your blood that I have been reborn
No one knows the day you're out to be
But I know you're coming back for me
Oh yes, my love, you are, you are my lighthouse
Hey, yes, I need your love
She and your light
Created me a clean hand
And renewed the rest within me
Ooh, yeah, oh, yeah (Love the way that I am)
(Shine your light on me)
I'm a bad, bad, bad man, hey (I'm a bad, bad, bad man)
I am (Shine your light)
You are my lifetime's assurance (Shine your light on me)
You are the lamp unto my feet and you are
You are the light unto my path (Shine your light on me)
Come from me Lord, you are my everlasting love
You are the one, I'm always thinking of (You're the only light for me)
I need your love, I need your love
