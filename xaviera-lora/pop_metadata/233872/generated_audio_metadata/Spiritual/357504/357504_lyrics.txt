I find it hard enough to wait
When my heart is far away and it's calling out, longing for home
You have no ties by majesty
Like a fire in front of me when you're calling me, calling me home
The sky will crack in two
And all I'll see is you
The brightest stars will fade someday, someday
All the dark will disappear
Hope will dawn from nights of fear
And you're calling me, calling me home
No more death, broken chains
When my soul emancipates
Come and call for me, you are my home
The sky will cry in two
And all I'll see is you
The brightest stars will fade
Someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday, someday, someday, someday, someday
We're shooting through the clouds
My heart was screaming shout
And riding on the air
My love you're there
Sky will cry in two
And all I'll see is you
Brighter stars will fade
Someday, someday
Someday, someday
