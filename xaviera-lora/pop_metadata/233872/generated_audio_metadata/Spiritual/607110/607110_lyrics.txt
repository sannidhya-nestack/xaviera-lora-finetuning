As I sit contemplating that glorious morning
The sun poured through the clouds and I imagined the day my name would call aloud
Oh what a day it would be finally
His face I see, yeah, shining like the stars
Brighter than the moon, he said he'll be back in his set soon
Yeah, real soon
But I don't wanna go alone, no
I want my mama standing next to me
Dad and the rest of my family, yeah
Suddenly it occurred to me
This is the place I wanna spend eternity, yeah
Oh, I can see it now
in a little while we'll be going
Home, that place we've prepared for, for so long
We'll join hands and embrace and rejoice in that glorious place
In a little while his face I'll see
The one who I've waited so patiently
He'll smile and take my hand
And say welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome home my child
Oh, but I don't wanna go alone, no, oh
I want my mama standing next to me
Dad and the rest of my family, yeah
Suddenly it occurred to me
This is the place I wanna spend eternity, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the eyes of suffering there's endless pain and despair
But you don't have to be alone because there's someone who truly cares
Oh, I can say I've been blessed'cause I've experienced His goodness
And when I'm feeling down, tired of the trials, I know that it's gonna be for sure
'Cause one day it'll soon be over and my work on earth will be done
And I can go and meet with him one on one, yeah
Finally it occurred to me this is the place I wanna spend eternity
I can see it now
I finally made it beyond the clouds
'Cause in a little while, we'll be going home
That place we prepared for, for so long
We'll join hands and embrace and rejoice in that glorious place
In a little while, his face I'll see
The one who I've waited so patiently
He'll smile and take my hand and say, "Welcome, welcome, welcome"
Welcome home my child
But I don't wanna go alone
No no no no no
I want my mama standing next to me
Dad and the rest of my family yeah
Finally it occurred to me
This is the place I wanna spend eternity
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus
I see you there my brother
I'll see you there my sister
I'll see you there, I'll meet you there
I wanna be there
Don't you wanna go, yeah yeah
Don't you wanna go, yeah yeah
