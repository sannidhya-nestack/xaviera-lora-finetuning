Friends, this is my way of communicating
To tell you what the Lord can do (the Lord can do)
Oh, He can save your soul, He can make you whole
That ain't all he can do for you
Oh when the doctor has given up on you
And it seems like there's nothing you can do
You can't do, oh you can't call on God, call on God
He's the one who made you, He's the one who made you
He'll bring peace to you, oh say it again, oh call on God, call on God
He's the one who made you, He's the one who made you
He'll bring peace to you, oh come on now
Now after you have been delivered
There is something else that you should know (you should know)
Oh, God is always there with you
And it doesn't matter where you go
Oh, when it seems like your foes and enemies are pressing you more and more and more
You can't call on God, call on God, He's the one who can
He's the one who made you, he'll bring peace to you (oh, say it again)
Call on God, call on God, he's the one who made you, he'll bring peace to you
