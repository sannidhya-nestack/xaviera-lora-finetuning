Come Thou Fountain, every blessing
To my heart You sing Thy praise
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise
Teach me some melody of song and
Some by flaming tongues of butter
Praise his name I'm fixed upon it
Name of God's redeeming love
Redeeming love, His love, redeeming love
Here I raise my Ebenezer
In the Bible help I come
And I hope I find good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
Interposed his precious blood
Precious love, His love
His precious love, His love
Redeeming love, His love
Redeeming love
O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to thee
Let thy goodness like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to thee
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Please my heart, Lord, take and seal it
Seated for Thy courts above
Courts above, above, Thy courts above
His blood, His precious blood
His blood, His precious blood
His love, redeeming love
His love, redeeming love
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it
Seal it for thy courts above
