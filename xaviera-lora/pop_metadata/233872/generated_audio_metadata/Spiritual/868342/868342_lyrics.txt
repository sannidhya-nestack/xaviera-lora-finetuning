Mirror, mirror, what's it gonna be?
Fortune teller, she been telling on me
A crystal ball says hallelujah, see
But the clock keeps on ticking to my destiny
Saying I can see the future in the palm of your hand
Saying I can see the promise in the promise
We got miles ahead, we got miles to go
And I'm closer to heaven, closer to home
Miles ahead we are miles to go and out closer to heaven closer to home
Who put the hours in the hourglass
Tell me why those sixty minutes
They move so fast
Who left the footprints in the sand
He was a tall, dark and handsome man
He said, I can see the future in the palm of your hand
He said, I can see the promise in the promised land
We got miles ahead, we got miles to go
And I'm closer to heaven
Closer to home (closer to home)
Closer to home (this is the way I find)
I'm a pilot (oh)
Miles ahead we got miles to go and
Closer to heaven
Closer to home, you gotta leave a little whiskey in the bottle
You gotta savour every sip before you swallow
You can't lead the hands of time, so why don't you follow?
They'll lead the way and back
(Closer to heaven, closer to heaven)
Miles ahead, we have none to go without
Closer to heaven (closer) closer to home
