It's the same battlefield
It's the same, it's the same battlefield
God gave us a job to do
Don't let it get between me and you
It's the same battlefield
It's the same battlefield
I want you to know it's the same
It's the same battlefield
Now God gave us a job to do
Don't let it get between me and you
It's the same battlefield
Now listen
If we would meet each other walking down the street
Don't cross to the other side
Because you don't wanna speak
Now God gave us a job to do
Don't let it get between me and you
This is the same battlefield
It's the same battlefield
I want you to know, y'all
It's the same battlefield
Now God gave us a job to do
Don't let it get between me and you
It's the same battlefield
I got something to say now
We all get together every now and then
Singin' some praise to God
Fellowship between friends
Now God gave us a job to do
Don't let it get between me and you
It's the same battle, same field
It's the same battlefield
We are all on the same
We're on the same battlefield
God gave us a job to do
Don't let it get between me and you
It's the same battlefield
Got one more thing to say
Treat your neighbor
From the goodness of your heart, with respect
God will see you through, so let him take care of that
God gave us a job to do, so don't let it get between me and you
It's the same, fight or fear
Don't put me down because of God let me steal
Stop throwing stones, you know that's not my God's will
God gave us a job to do
Don't let it get between me and you
