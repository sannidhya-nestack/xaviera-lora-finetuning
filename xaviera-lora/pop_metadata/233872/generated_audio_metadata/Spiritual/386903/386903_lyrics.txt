I stood by the shore waiting for your voice
And when I heard your word my heart was filled with joy
But sometimes I feel alone and I fall
While walking through this fallen world
Do you know I am with you?
I'll keep you safe under my wings
I'll never lose or ever leave
Don't be afraid, help me not to fear
I pray for my child out there all alone
Hoping in my heart that he will make it home
Please help him today, for today is so hard
While walking through this fallen world
And he says, do you know who I am?
I'll keep you safe under my wings
I'll never leave, please watch over him
Don't be afraid, I am a thankful lord
I am with you
Now you've made my heart your permanent home
And filled me with wisdom that only you've known
I know who you are now
You're the lord of all things
That's why I'm no longer feeling
Now you know I am with you
I know I'm safe with you
I am grateful, Lord, I am not afraid
You always
