He leadeth me with blessed thought
O words with heavenly comfort fraught
Whatever I do, wherever I be
Still'tis God's hand that leadeth me
He leadeth me, he leadeth me
By his own hand he leadeth me
His faithful follower I would be
For by his hand he leads
Sometimes, mid scenes of deepest gloom, Sometimes, where e'er times' bowers bloom,
By waters calm, or troubled seas still tease His hand that leadeth me.
He leadeth me, he leadeth me
By his own hand he leadeth me
His faithful follower I would be
For by his hand he
Day three
