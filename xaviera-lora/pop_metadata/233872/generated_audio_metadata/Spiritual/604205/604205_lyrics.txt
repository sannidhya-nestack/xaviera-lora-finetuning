One thing I have desired from the Lord That I may dwell in the house of my God
All the days of my life to the end of my days
Lord, I give you praise
Lord, I give you praise
There's one thing
One thing I have desired from the Lord
That I may dwell in the house of my God
All the days of my life
Till the end of my days
Lord, I give you praise
Lord, I give you praise
I'll give you everything (I'll give you everything I've got)
Examine my heart and see me through (Oh, oh, oh)
Oh Jesus, have your way in me (That I may dwell)
That I may dwell (Oh Lord)
The Lord is my protection
I'm chasing after God's direction
And if you're wondering about
What I'm gonna do right now
I give God my praise
I give God my praise
One thing I have desired from the Lord
That I may dwell in the house of my God
All the days of my life to the end of my days
Lord, I give you praise (Lord, I give you praise)
Lord, I give you praise (Lord, I give you praise)
I'll give you everything I've got
I've got, examine my heart and see me through
Jesus have your way in me (Jesus have your way in me)
That I may dwell (That I may dwell)
Everything I've got is yours (I'll give you everything I've got)
Examine my heart (Come and see me through)
Oh, oh, oh (Oh Jesus, have your way in me)
Have your way in me, Jesus (Let all my faith be yours)
Have your way in me, Lord Jesus (Be yours)
Let I may dwell in your house
