Your mercy, O all-eternal One
By no heart made you yet
In joy or grief or shade or sun
I never will et
I give the whole and not the part of all you gave to me
My goods, my life, my soul, my heart I yield them all as free
And when in silent awe we wait
And word and sign forbear
The hinges of the golden gate move
Soundless at our prayer
Your mercy, oh, all-eternal One
By no heart measured yet
Enjoy your grief or shade or sun
I never will et
In joy or grief or shade or sun I never will et
