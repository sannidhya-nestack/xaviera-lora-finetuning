There is a name I love to hear
I love to sing its worth
It sounds like music in my ear
The sweetest name on earth
Oh how I love Jesus Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus Because He first loved me
It tells me of a Savior's love
Who died to set me free
It tells me of His precious blood
A sinner's perfect plea
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
It tells me of a father's smile
Beaming upon his child
It cheers me through this little while
Through desert, waste and wild
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me
It makes my trembling heart rejoice
It dries each rising tear
It tells me in a still small voice
To trust and never fear
Jesus, the name I love so well
The name I love to hear
No saint on earth its worth can tell
No heart can see how dear
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me
Because He first loved me
Oh how I love Jesus
