In your name the slave is free
Darkness fails and demons flee
In your name the curse of sin is broken
Sorrow yields to joy for praises as your name is spoken
This is the name we praise
This is the power that frees us
No other name can save
We speak the name of Jesus
There is hope and perfect peace
Speak your name and tempests cease
The lame are healed and wounded hearts are mended
The graves defeated and the sting of death's forever ended
This is the name we praise
This is the power that frees us
No other name can say
Lord we speak your name
We speak the name of Jesus
Jesus, the lamb and the lion
Jesus, Jesus, creation's crying
Jesus, Jesus
This is the name we praise
This is the power that frees us
No other name can save
We speak the name of Jesus (This is the name we praise) (This is the name we praise) (This is the only power, the only power that can free us) (This is the power that free us) (Jesus, Jesus) (Oh, the name, the name we can say) (Lord, we speak your name)
We speak the name of Jesus (we speak the name of Jesus)
We speak the name of Jesus (we speak the name of Jesus)
We speak the name of Jesus (we speak the name of Jesus)
