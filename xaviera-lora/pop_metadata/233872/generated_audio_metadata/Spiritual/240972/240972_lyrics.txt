Here I stand before you, humbled as I pray
Bringing you the dreams I've held that somehow slipped away
Giving you these moments, my future in your hands
Knowing I am trusting in your love that never ends
You are my one desire
You are my faithful friend
You are the one that turns you and my heart is home again
Here my heart is satisfied
Though the world won't understand
Still my heart is satisfied
With your love
Even in the desert
But still you brought the rain
And every road I walked on led me
Back to you again
Now I'm coming closer
Than I've ever been before
Feeling how you love me makes me
Only love you more
You are my one
You are my faithful friend
You are the one that's into you
And my heart is home again
Here my heart is satisfied
Though the world won't understand
Still my heart is satisfied
I will not et
That you were there for me
I will not et
The love that makes me see
You are my one desire
You are my faithful friend
You are the one
You are the one that turns you and my heart is home again
You are my one desire
You are my faithful friend
You are the one that turns you and my heart is home again
Here my heart is satisfied
Though the world won't understand
Still my heart is satisfied
With your love
