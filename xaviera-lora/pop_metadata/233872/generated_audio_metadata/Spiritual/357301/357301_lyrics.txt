(baby crying)
Well I hear they're singing in the streets that Jesus is alive
And all creation shouts aloud that Jesus is alive
Now surely we can all be changed cause Jesus is alive
And everybody here can know that Jesus is alive
And I will live for all my days
To raise the banner of truth and light
I'm gonna sing about my Savior's love, yeah
And the best thing that happened
Was the day I met you
I found Jesus
I found Jesus
I found Jesus
I found Jesus
I feel like dancing in the streets,'cause Jesus is alive
To join with all who celebrate that Jesus is alive
The joy of God is in this town,'cause Jesus is alive
And everybody's seen the truth that Jesus is alive
And I will live for all my days
To raise the banner of truth and light
And I'm gonna sing about my Savior's love (sing it out)
And the best thing that happened was the day I met you (I found Jesus)
