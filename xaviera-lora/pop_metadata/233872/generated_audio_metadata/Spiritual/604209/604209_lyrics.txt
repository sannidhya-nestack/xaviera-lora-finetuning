Before you bowed your head and died
I heard you calling my name but why
Why do you sacrifice your life for me
God I lift mine eyes up high
But I can see you through the cloudy sky
However, I see your work surrounds me
Tell me who can light the sun
And who can let the layman run
You are love
God is love, God is love, even if, even if dark days have arrived
Hold your peace and joy
For our God's our strength and shield
God is love and He'll never change
God is love, I won't et this truth in my mind
When darkness falls I run to you
You see to me at once without a cue
As if for a moment I'm your only one
Gotta contemplate your name
Ask you to remove all my sin and shame
I love you, my God and my Redeemer
Show me how you touch my heart
Hope your kingdom make me a part
God is love (God is love)
God is love, He loves darkness never ends, never ends, never ends
Hold your peace (hold your peace)
There's a joy for our God's love (and don't you show it)
And she (and she)
Whatever happens don't et that He's love (God is love)
And He'll never change (and He'll never change)
How can He do it?
God is love
I won't et this truth in my mind
In my mind, don't lose your joy (in my mind) in my mind (in my mind) in my mind (don't lose your peace of joy)
