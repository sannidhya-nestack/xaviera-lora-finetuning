Into your courts I come
I'm looking for the one
Who stole my heart away
And gave a heart of flesh
A robe of righteousness
In your courts I want to stay
Your glory's filling this place
We live to see your face
Your love endures through all time
Your praise on my lips you'll find
Lord I long to worship you
Lord I long to worship you
Lord, I long to worship you, my Lord
I've come to dance and shout
To move and twirl about
I've come to sing and play for you
You are my source of peace
Your river runs through me
In your spirit I am free
Your glory's filling this place
We live to seek your face
Your love endures through all time
Your praise on my lips you'll find
Lord, I long to worship You (I long to worship You)
Lord, I long to worship You (I long to worship You)
Lord, I long to worship You, my Lord (my Lord)
Lord, I long to worship You (I long to worship You)
Lord, I long to worship You (I long to worship You)
Lord, I long to worship You, my Lord
My Lord, my Lord, my Lord
Into your courts I come
