I've got the long end of the stick
I've got the lion's shell
Bread on my table, you know
I didn't even put it down
He gives us night and the day
A little work, a little play
But to love our neighbors
Would we even doubt
When they don't ask for much
He don't ask for much, no he don't ask for much
Just that we give each other love, yeah
Now I've been so blessed
You know I need to try my best, yeah
he don't, he don't
He don't ask for much
He keep me safe from all harm
He saved me from my sins
In love it could be the norm
But we would just let him in
The way it's already made
The price has long been paid
Just when do I start to tell
About how good he's been
When he don't ask so much
He don't ask for much
No, he don't ask for much
Except we give each other some love, yeah
Now I've been so blessed
You know I'm gonna try my best, yeah, yeah
he don't, he don't
He don't ask for much
He don't ask for much
No, he don't ask for much
No, he don't ask for much
Just that we give each other some love
Now I've been so blessed
You know I'm gonna try my best
'Cause he don't, he don't
He don't ask for much, he don't ask for much
He don't ask for much, no, he don't ask for much
Just that we give each other some love, yeah
Now I've been so blessed
You know I'm gonna try my best, yeah
'Cause he don't, he don't, he don't ask for much
He don't ask for much
Give somebody some love
