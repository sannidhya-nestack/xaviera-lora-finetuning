Tear down, tear down these walls
That separates me from your holiness
I want to see your face and know the goodness there
And in your presence die that I might live again
Purified, untried by your love divine
Consuming glints and fire burning my soul
Tear down, tear down this wall
That separates me from your holiness
I want to see your face
And know that goodness there
And in your presence die
That I'll live again
Tear down, tear down these walls
Separate me from your holiness
I want to see your face
And all the goodness there
And in your presence die
That I might live again
Purified and dry
By your love divine
Consumed, glancing fire
Burning my soul
So tear down, tear down this wall
That separates me from your holiness
I want to see your face and all the goodness there
And in your presence die that I may live again
Separates me from your holiness
I want to see your face and all the goodness there
And in your presence, I, that I believe again
