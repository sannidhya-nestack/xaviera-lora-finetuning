Down by the water
Down by the ocean where the spirit runs free
There's a sign something's coming
A new sensation taking over me
Oh, I hear a new day calling
Yes, I know the time is coming
Up on the mountain
Over the hillside and two worlds away
There's a whisper sent from the heavens
A new beginning, it is on the way
Oh, I hear a new day calling
I know the time is coming
Yes, I hear a new day calling
Yes, I do, oh
Now the time is coming, it's coming right through
Down by the ocean
Down by the water
Where the spirit runs free
There's a spot on the horizon
Something special, something to believe, oh, I hear a new day calling
Oh, I know the time is coming
Yes, I hear a new day calling
Yes, it's calling, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now the time is coming, here it comes
