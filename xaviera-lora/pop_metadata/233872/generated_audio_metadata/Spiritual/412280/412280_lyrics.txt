Lord, I know how much you love all of your children the same
Yet each time I hear your voice quietly call my name
You make me feel
Like the apple of your eye
You make me feel
Like I'm your only child
You shower me with love
Like I'm your only child
And all you're thinking of
Lord your love is big enough
For every daughter and son
Yet you hide me in your wings
Like I'm the only one
You make me feel like the apple
You make me feel like I'm your only child
You shower me with love like I'm your only child
And all you're thinking of
I love you because you adopted me
I love you because you first loved me
You make me feel like I'm your only child
You shower me with love
Like I'm your only child
And all you're thinking of
Like I'm your only child
You're showering me with love
Like I'm your only child
And all you're thinking of
