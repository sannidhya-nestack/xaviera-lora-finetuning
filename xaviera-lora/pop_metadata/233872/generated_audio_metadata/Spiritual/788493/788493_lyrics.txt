I have lived long enough to know
There is something wrong with the world
But I guess I haven't lived long enough
To think it can't be cured
What if peace could rule the planet
And what if hate could take a holiday
What if joy and love could reign instead of guns
What if peace was king for just a day
What if everybody on this earth had enough to eat
What if all the drugs that make men kill
Were taken off the street
What if peace could rule the planet
And what if hate could take a holiday
What if joy and love could reign instead of guns
What if peace was king for just a day
Now I know you think it's impossible
To do what I describe
But if we can't put a man on the moon
Then how come we can't try
What if peace could rule the planet
And what if hate could take a holiday
What if joy and love could reign instead of guns?
What if peace was king for just a day?
What if peace could rule for just one day?
What if?
Worry, oh worry
Worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
What is?
