I dream at night of food on the table and the kids getting ready to eat
But the sun comes up and there I am back in reality
Lookin' in their eyes of hunger
Lord, how they haunt my dreams
The eyes of hunger never seem to sleep
If there's money enough to put a man on the moon
And enough to buy all of the guns
Then there's got to be enough to buy food for everyone
If you looked into their eyes of hunger
They'd burn a hole in your soul
The eyes of hunger would never let you go
If love can make the world go round
Then love can make us stop and think
Of the millions who go to sleep each night
Wondering when they'll eat
If we look into their eyes with hunger
Maybe
The eyes of hunger look to you and me
If we look into their eyes of hunger maybe then we'll see
The eyes of hunger look to you and me
Ooh
