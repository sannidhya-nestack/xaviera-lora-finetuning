Somewhere in life's shadows you're gonna find Jesus
You're gonna be there all alone
Gonna look at you and say
Somewhere have you been
When what's taken you so long, yeah
What took you so long
The road of life is so rocky and rough
There's gonna come a time when you say that enough is enough
Oh, when it seems like you just can't go the distance
Well, he'll be there to pick you up (yeah, mama)
He's gonna be there to pick you up
When the road you're on has so much resistance
It gets so tight that you can't go the distance
When this old world has dragged you down in the rug
He'll be there to pick you up
He's always there to pick you up
The road of life is so rocky and rough
There's gonna come a time when you say that enough is enough
Oh, and it seems like you just can't go the distance
But he'll be there to pick you up, yeah
He's gonna be there to pick you up
The road of life is so rocky and rough
There's gonna come a time when you say that enough is enough
Oh, and it seems like you just can't go the distance
But here'll be there to pick you up, yeah
There's gonna be there to pick you up
Somewhere in life's shadows
You're gonna find Jesus
And you're gonna be there all alone
He's gonna look at you and say
Somewhere have you been
Oh and what has taken you so long, yeah
Oh what took you so long
The road of life is so rocky and rough
There's gonna come a time when you say that enough is enough
Oh, and it seems like you just can't go the distance
Well, he'll be there to pick you up
He's gonna be there to pick you up
He'll be there to pick you up
He's gonna be there to pick you up, yeah
And always there to pick you up
And He'll be there to pick you up
To pick you up
He's gonna be there to pick you up
And Jesus will be there to pick you up
