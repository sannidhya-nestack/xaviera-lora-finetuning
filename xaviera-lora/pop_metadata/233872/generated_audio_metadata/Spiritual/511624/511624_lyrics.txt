Everything is nothing without your love
Everything is nothing without you
There is only one word that describes your love
True, true
Through my darkest moments you have lived my pain
I'm forever grateful and aware
I owe so much to you I just cannot repay
You are the truth, the strength, my prayer
Everything is nothing without your love
Everything is nothing without you
There is only one word that describes my love
True, true
Every single second of each single day
There is nowhere else I'd rather be
Than in your life and in your heart and by your side
There is no face I'd rather see
There is only one word that describes my love
True, true, true
