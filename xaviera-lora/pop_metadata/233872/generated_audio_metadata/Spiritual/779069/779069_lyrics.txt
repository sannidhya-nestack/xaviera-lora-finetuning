Never saw the beauty of the stars
Till they lit your face
Never knew my soul is where you are
'Til I fell from grace, never knew magic could get crazy as this
I fell under your spell
Never knew how holy was the night
I saw the dawn, I was always hiding from your light
Wishing you were gone, never dreamed that I could be as happy as this
I surrendered to you, I never knew
But I know even if I live a century
I still will find it hard to understand
Why all the memories that mean the most to me
Are the ones I didn't plan
Never heard the reason I should live
Till I was nearly deaf
Never knew how much I had to give
Till I had nothing left
I was suffocating in an ocean of noise
Till your voice came through clear and true
I never knew
Never knew, never knew
