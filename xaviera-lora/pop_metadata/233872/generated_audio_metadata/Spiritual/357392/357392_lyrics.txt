Enough of this mess, had enough of ourselves
And we lost so much of identity, we're left with a shell
I want a piece of the truth, I want a portion of peace
But I purchased what I've told myself and I should believe it
And I've got a face, got a name, got a
You got the time and mama can you spare me some change
it's half past nine
Hate to break up your reverie
But I'm here you see
And I'm no better man for
The time after time you lie
I can't give in to my selfish will this time
And you are fearfully and wonderfully made
You are everything God wants you to be
A little step inside and you just might find
Everything you've tried to hide
Just deny all the lies this time
In the core of your mind
Well, it's been ten thousand years since you caught that disease
And ten thousand times have you just tried to breathe
And you can pull yourself down and choke till you drown
But you're beautiful, you're so beautiful, oh oh
Time after time you lie
I can't give in to my selfish will this time
You are, beautifully and wonderfully made
You are everything God wants you to be
A little step inside and you just might find
Everything you've tried to hide
Just ignite all the lights this time, yeah
And you are, fearfully, yeah
And you are, oh
And you are, fearfully, yeah yeah
You are, oh
A little step inside
And you just might find everything you've tried to hide
Just deny all the lies this time in the courtroom of your mind
In the courtroom of your mind, yeah
In the courtroom of your mind
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Tryin' to be at home to find it yourself
But you wanna be the kind of love that's in the courtroom
That's in the courtroom of your mind
In your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind
Of your
I'm hurt
