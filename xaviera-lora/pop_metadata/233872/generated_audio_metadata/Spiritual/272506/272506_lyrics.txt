Before all time
You said, "Let there be"
And created the world
Overwhelming to see
Once a formless earth
Deep and dark as night
At Your command
Filled with your light that shines
The highest heights, the deepest depths
Every living thing born from your breath
God Almighty
We will lift you high
You shaped the earth and created the sky and we will
Ever come to understand
The marvellous works of your mighty hand
From dawn till dusk
The sun bears down the light of day
From then till now the endless realms
Of stars still burning bright surround the moonlight sky
Lights of the night
Above the earth, below the seas
Creation speaks your mystery
God Almighty
We will lift you high
You shaped the earth and created the sky
And we will never come to understand
The marvellous works of your mighty hand
Such a perfect world (such a perfect world)
Such a perfect love (what a perfect love)
Such a perfect gift (what a perfect gift)
From the King above
God Almighty
We will lift you high, you shaped the earth and created the sky
And we will never come to understand
The marvellous works of your mighty hand
God Almighty
We will lift you high
You shaped the earth and created the sky
And we will never come to understand
The marvellous works of your mighty hand
