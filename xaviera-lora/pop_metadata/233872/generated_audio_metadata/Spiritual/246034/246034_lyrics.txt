Seems every day
Far too many voices
Offer different choices
And what they say
Is not always what they mean
There's truth and lies and everything in between
But in the stillness
I hear you call my name
And you speak to me
Your voice in love so quietly
Whispering like a gentle breeze
You speak to me
The worlds and seas that come our sea
It's such a beautiful mystery
The way you speak to me (speak to me)
And everywhere
I take this comfort with me
The assurance that you give me
You're always there
To lend your hand of grace
And lead me through all the storms I face
You still the water
Your word is my safe harbor
And you speak to me
Your voice of love so quietly
Whispering like a gentle breeze
You speak to me
The words of peace that call us in
It's such a beautiful thing
The way you speak to me
The way you speak to me
And in the stillness
I hear you call my name
And you speak to me
Your voice of love so quietly
Whispering like a gentle breeze
You speak to me
The words are seeds that come from the sea
Such a beautiful thing
Mystery, the way you speak to me (speak to me)
The way you speak to me
