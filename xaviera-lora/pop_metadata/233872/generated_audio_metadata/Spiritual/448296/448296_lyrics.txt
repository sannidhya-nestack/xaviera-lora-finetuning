Lord, I want to be a vessel undone just for you
A candle brightly burning for a darkened world of you
When I think of how you died to save me from my sin and shame
I sing glory hallelujah and offer praises to your name
And I glorify you, it's all my heart can do
Lifting holy hands to heaven, to whom all praises due
I glorify you, who is faithful and true
Abiding in your presence, Lord, I'm glorifying you
You're the Alpha and Omega
The beginning and the end
You're the way, the truth, the life
To all who will freely enter in
And to the beauty of your majesty
I can hear the angels sing
Crying holy, holy, holy
Lord of Lords and King of Kings
And I glorify You, it's all my heart can do
Lifting holy hands to Heaven, to whom all praises due
I glorify You who is faithful and true
Abiding in Your presence, Lord, I'm glorifying You
Let the words that I speak and the things that I do
And the thoughts that I think only glorify you
And I glorify you, it's all my heart can do
Lifting holy hands to heaven
To whom all praises due
I glorify you
Who is faithful and true
Abiding in your presence, Lord
I'm glorifying
Yes, I'm glorifying
And I'm glorifying you
