I am a poor, wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world of woe
Yet there's no sickness or danger
And that bright world to which I go
I'm going there to see my mother
I'm going there no more to roam
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home
I know dark clouds will hang around me
I know my way is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me
Where gods redeem their vigils keep
I'm going there to see my father
I'm going there no more to roam
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home
I am a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world of woe
And there's no sickness, toil, or danger
In that bright world which I go
I'm going there
To see my savior
I'm going there, no more to roam
I am just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home
