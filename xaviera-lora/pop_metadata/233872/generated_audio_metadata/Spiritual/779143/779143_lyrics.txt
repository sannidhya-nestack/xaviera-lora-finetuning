The greatest story ever told
Of kings and wars and rich man's gold
The evil of the devil
And his fight to get your soul
A story full of miracles
Tales of lust and greed
Temptation, truth and promises
And love's eternal seed
Eternal sea
Spoke as I was leaving, I'm a God created man
I face life and its burdens with the Bible in my hand
When I work for God I'm special, hope fills my heart again
Save your soul and believe the greatest story told to man
The greatest story ever told
Of kings and wars and rich man's gold
The evil of the devil
And his fight to get your soul
A story full of miracles
Tales of lust and greed
Temptation, truth and promises
And love's eternal seed
He handed me his barrel, then turned and walked away
That was my epiphany, I changed my life that day
Now I know all the power that's hidden in his word
The greatest story ever told, God's the life I live on earth
The greatest story ever told
Of kings and wars and rich man's gold
The evil of the devil
And his fight to get your soul
A story full of miracles
Tales of lust and greed
Temptation, truth and promises
And love's eternal seed
Each other, we'll see
