Father, we need you, show us your face
Father, oh Father, your saving grace
Jesus, you gave your life, you died on that tree
You gave up the spirit
You gave everything to me
Yahweh, Yahweh Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
It is done
Father, oh Father, soon the day will come
When all will bow down and pray to the Holy One, sing
Yahweh, Yahweh, Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, it is done, it is done
I'll keep my eyes on you
Holy fire melt the chains
That hold me back from you
In my life only one God, one God
One God reigns, oh, one God reigns
Yahweh, Yahweh, Yahweh, Yahweh, Yahweh, Yahweh, Yahweh, Yahweh, Jesus, Jesus, Yahweh, Yahweh, Yahweh, Prince of Peace
Jesus it is done Yahweh Yahweh Jesus Holy Jesus Yahweh it is done Oh it is done it is done
It is done.
