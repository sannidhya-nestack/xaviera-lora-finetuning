It's so easy to become discouraged
Do what's right but bad things come to you
Live in hope and you kneel and pray
All you want is a better day
And suddenly from the heavens above
Hear God's voice and you feel his love
Don't give up, don't give up
Quitting's not a choice
Don't give up, don't give up
Listen to God's voice
Don't give up, don't give up
Ignore the enemy's noise
Don't give up
Walk in faith (walk in faith)
Step towards the light
Sing God's praise (sing God's praise)
He will help you fight
Take God's grace (take God's grace)
He will shine a light to his place
When times get rough
You need to take God's courage
His armor he has laid out there for you
Pick it up and wear it well
Ling the arrows back to hell
Stand your ground and hold God's truth
He'll be there fighting with you
Don't give up, don't give up
Quitting's not a choice, don't give up, don't give up
Listen to God's voice, don't give up, don't give up
Ignore the enemy's noise, don't give up
Walk in faith, walk in faith
Step towards the light
Sing God's praise, sing God's praise
He will help you fight, take God's grace, take God's grace
He will shine a light to his place
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
Walk in faith, walk in faith
Walk in faith, walk in faith
Walk in faith, walk in faith
Don't give up, don't give up
Greeting's not a choice
Don't give up, don't give up
Listen to God's voice
Don't give up, don't give up
Ignore the enemy's noise
Don't give up
Walk in faith, walk in faith
Step towards the light, take God's grace, take God's grace
He will help you fight, take God's grace, take God's grace
He will shine a light to his place
Don't give up
