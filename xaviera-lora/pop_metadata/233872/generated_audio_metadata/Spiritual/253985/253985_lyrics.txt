When my hope has lost its way
In my sin and my shame
I can call on your name
And you'll answer me when I pray
Running, running, running
Always running uphill
Funny how it often seems I'm standing still
And I'm wondering if it's perception or reality
With such a huge selection
Somehow it's always me
Adversity builds character, at least that's what I've been told
But sometimes all this baggage makes me feel one hundred years old
Then I remember what you told me
For everything I have, you paid the greatest price
So how can I feel sorry for myself?
You've given me the greatest gift of all
You've given me my life
Running, running, running
Feels like running in place
Came up from behind
Now I'm just struggling
To keep the pace
And I guess I should be thankful
That these trials are nothing new
Experience has granted me
The strength to
Although the road is winding and the signs aren't always clear
I know if you walk next to me that I
I will persevere
I remember
What you told me
For everything I have
You paid the greatest price
So high
How can I feel sorry for myself?
You've given me the greatest gift of all
You've given me my life
