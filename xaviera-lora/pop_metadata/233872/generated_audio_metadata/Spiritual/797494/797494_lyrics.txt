I wait upon the Lord
I wait upon the Lord
I wait upon the Lord my God
Who takes away the sin of the world
If you want to find Jesus
Go in the wilderness
Go in the wilderness
Go in the wilderness
Morning brother
Go in the wilderness
Wait upon the Lord
I wait upon the Lord
I wait upon the Lord, I wait upon the Lord my God, Who takes away the sin of the world
If you want to be a Christian
Go in the wilderness
Go in the wilderness
Go in the wilderness
Morning sister
Go in the wilderness
Wait upon the Lord
I wait upon the Lord, I wait upon the Lord, I wait upon the Lord my God, Who takes away the sin of the world
Jesus is awaiting to meet you in the wilderness (meet you in the wilderness)
Meet you in the wilderness (meet you in the wilderness)
Jesus is awaiting to meet you in the wilderness (meet you in the wilderness)
So wait upon the Lord, say it again
Jesus is awaiting to meet you in the wilderness, meet you in the wilderness, meet you in the wilderness
Jesus is awaiting to meet you in the wilderness, I wait upon the Lord
I wait upon the Lord
