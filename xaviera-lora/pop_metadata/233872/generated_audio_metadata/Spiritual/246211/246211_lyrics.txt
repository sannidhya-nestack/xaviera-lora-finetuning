Listen, the morals and the values of America that we once knew
Has been reduced to a issue, thank you, what you wanted to do
The true meaning of a family is now under attack
We need to come to our senses and bring morality back
You know we need to stand for holiness
Stand for righteousness
No more loneliness
Enough is enough
Stand with one voice
Stand and make the right choice
God's kingdom's tough as violence
But the violent take it by force
Silent no more, silent no more, silent no more, we will, we will be silent no more, for the sake of our nation, for the sake of our families, for the sake of God's kingdom, we will be silent no more, silent no more
Break the silence, break the silence, come on
Break the silence, come on
Hey, yeah, it's
I'm tired of all religious and traditional Sunday morning dream
We're never lost in domination of people that doesn't know that hell is real
Hell while we're busy and our church is fighting over sitting on the front pew
Oh oh oh oh
When need to get outside the church walls and go tell them the truth
Tell them to stand for holiness
Stand for holiness
Stand for righteousness
No more lawlessness
Enough is enough is enough
Stand with one voice
Stand and make the right choice
Your kingdom suffers violence
But the violence take it by force
Silent no more
Silent no more
We won't be silent no more
No more, no more
We will be silent no more
For the sake of our nation
For the sake of our family
