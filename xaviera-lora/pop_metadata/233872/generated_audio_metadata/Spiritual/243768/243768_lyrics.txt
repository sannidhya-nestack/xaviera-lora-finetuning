You sit there all alone, wondering where you've been
You used to want to learn to love, but now you can't begin
You lived so long without that love, and now you want it back
Call Jesus' name, He'll run to you
He'll give you faith to finally act
The waiting's over (the waiting's over)
God's been there all along
And wants you to decide
The waiting's over (the waiting's over)
Jesus calls to your heart
Will you ask Him to come inside?
Your world rejected you and you don't understand
You think all your loneliness is in the maker's plan
You feel the time is almost up to find the love that's true
But little did you know right now
Your waiting's almost through
The waiting's over
God's been there all along
And wants you to decide
The waiting's over
Jesus calls to your heart
Will you ask him to come inside?
Don't you miss the peace you knew before your wounded heart withdrew?
The waiting's over (the waiting's over)
God's been there all along and wants you to decide
The waiting's over (the waiting's over)
Jesus calls to your heart if you ask him to come inside
The waiting's over
It's over
