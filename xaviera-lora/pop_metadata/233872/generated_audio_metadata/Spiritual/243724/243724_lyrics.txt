I have heard of angels and how they arm their wings
Swinging on the clouds, playing harps and things
Of how they watch us through the day and hold us in the night
Find homes for homeless children and in the dark bring light
On TV they hold trembling hands and dry a falling tear
It seems whoever needs one will always find the mirror
But what of days, days that end with no angel we can see
What if that hungry heart out there is waiting just for me
I can hold that hurting soul
I can lie a tear, I can be there in the night
To pray away a fear, should I wait for an angel
To hear that stranger's plea
What if the miracle that's needed is Christ in me
I look all around me and see so much despair
A world of dying people, does anybody care?
I know there are wonders, the parting of the sea
A vision of the Virgin, a holy tapestry
And oh, it's hard to hear good news with children to be fed
When half the world goes hungry with no place to lay their head
And what of days, days that end with no miracle to see?
What if that hungry child out there is waiting just for me
I can hold that hurting soul
I can cry a tear, I can be there in the night
To pray away a fear, should I wait for an angel
To hear that stranger's plea
What if the miracle that's needed is Christ in me?
Should I wait for an angel to hear that stranger's plea?
What if the miracle that's needed is Christ in me?
The only miracle that's needed is Christ in me
