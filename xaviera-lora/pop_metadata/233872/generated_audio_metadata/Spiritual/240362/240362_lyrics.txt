I don't know if I can face another day
The sandy place I've built is starting to decay
The sun has dried up all the water from the sand
I watch the grain slip through my hands
Let your tidal wave crash over me
I'm caught in the flow and I get carried away
Let your tidal wave crash over me
Your love is an ocean, you're far over me
I can't say which way the wind will blow today
I'm not afraid of any storms that come my way
I can walk on water and even if I drown
Your love brings me back around
I'll let your tidal wave crash over me
I'm caught in the flow and I get carried away
I'll let your tidal wave crash over me
Your love is an ocean yet more over me
I'll let your tidal wave crash over me
I'm caught in the flow and I get carried away
Let your dead weight catch over me
Your love is an ocean, you're far over me
And I can't swipe the wave
Swipe the wave, swipe the swipe the wave, swipe the wave
Swipe the wave, swipe the swipe the wave, swipe the wave
Let your tidal wave crash over me
I'm caught in the flow and I get carried away
Let your tidal wave crash over me
Your love is an ocean, you're poor over me
Let your tidal wave crash over me
I'm caught in the flow and I get carried away
Let your tidal wave crash over me
Your love is an ocean, you're poor over me
I'm caught in the flow and I get carried away (I'm caught in the flow and I get carried away) (Yeah, knock it slack, do it right) let your tide wave crash over me (I'm caught in the flow and I get carried away) (I'm caught in the flow and I get carried away) (Yeah, knock it slack, do it right) let your tide wave crash over me (I'm caught in the flow and I get carried away) (Yeah, knock it slack, do it right) let your tide wave crash over me (I'm caught in the flow and I get carried away) (Yeah, knock it slack, do it right) let your tide wave crash over me (I'm caught in the flow and I get carried away) (Yeah, knock it slack, do it right) let your tide wave crash over me (I'm caught in the flow and I get carried away) (Yeah, knock it slack, do it right) let your tide wave crash over me
