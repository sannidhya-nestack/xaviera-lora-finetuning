One heart, one kiss, the everlasting love
Why does it always go this way?
Whether we're right or we're wrong
Matters less than the future allows
Can we give up the past for today?
We give it all we've got but the past remembers
Only pain and strife and sadness and sorrow (tears, nothing)
Till the future returns to me
All we have planted, all we have sown
I will remember the love that we've known
On a ship everlastingly lost in the night on the sea of our love
Tomorrow waits for the future, we're here today
We must live each and every minute, love gives the way
One kiss can heal every heartache
One love will do
One heart and mind for each other
One love will do
I believe there's a God up above
Who can see through the darkness
And guide us all back home
Through the rivers of night, through the deserts by day
I'm just living the short
