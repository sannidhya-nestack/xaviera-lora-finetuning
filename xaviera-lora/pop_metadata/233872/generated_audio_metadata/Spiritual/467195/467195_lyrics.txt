When I'm lost and wondering
Can't see which way to go
When the signs are hidden
And the path is overgrown
When my course is doubtful
When I feel all alone
Worried and frustrated
Caused by every wind that blows
I long for someone to take my hand and understand
Guide, direct, and help when I can't help myself
He cares, even in my darkest times He's there, He sees my needs
Even when I don't have a prayer He sets me free
From the world that are surrounding me and I'm not alone
I know he's watching over me
I know he's watching over me
He's watching over me
When my guilt consumes me
Drives me up to the highest ledge
When life seems so hopeless
Under a hundred clouds of dread
He won't let me tumble
He pulls me back from the very edge
To him I surrender, I'm built into his arms instead
I know he's the one to take my hand and understand
God direct and help when I can't help myself
He cares, even in my darkest time, he's there, he sees my needs
Even when I don't have a prayer, he sets me free
From the walls that are surrounding me and I'm not alone (I'm not alone)
I know He's watching over me (He's watching over me, yeah, He's watching over me)
When I'm lost and wondering
Can you see which way to go at all
He's right there beside me
He will never let me fall
Empty, yeah
Even in the darkest time, He's there, He sees my need
Even when I don't have a prayer, He sets me free
From the walls that are surrounding me and I'm not alone
I know he's watching over me, I know he's watching over me, ooh, he's watching over me, yeah, he's watching over me
