Look to Calvary, look to Calvary if you're looking for a cure
Look to Calvary, look to Calvory if you want medicine for your soul
Look to Calvary, look to Calvary
Praise the Father each day for Calvary
Thank our Lord Jesus for His sacrifice of love
For you and me, look to Calvary
Oh, look to Calvary
Understand that Jesus has all the powers of heaven
And He could have said we were not worthy
All of His pain
Jesus is the one, the one and only one
Who stands in the gap, protecting you and me
He gives us every moment in life, every breath we take
And He holds us in the palm of His hand
When you trust in Jesus, help is always on the way
Whatever you ask
He is always there to help you every day
If you want silver and gold
Just look to Calvary
Look to Calvary
Just look to Calvary
Look to Calvary
Get on your knees and praise the Father
Every day for Calvary
Get on your knees and thank our Lord Jesus each day
For his great sacrifice of love for you and me
Look to Calvary, just look up to Calvary
And you must understand, Jesus has all the powers of heaven
And he could have said that we were not worth all of his suffering and all of his pain
If you want riches, be on this earth
If you want to sit next to God's heavenly throne
If you want to see all the wonders of God's great universe
Just look up and you will see Jesus face to face
He will dry away all your tears and you will know where you belong
He will call you brother or sister in your heavenly home
Look to Jesus and look up to Him
Look up to Calvary
Look to Calvary, oh look to Calvary
Praise the Father each day for Calvary
Thank our Lord Jesus for His great sacrifice
Of love for you and me
Look to Calvary, look to Calvary
Understand that Jesus has all the powers of heaven
And he could have said that we were not worth all of his pain
Look to Calvary, look to Calvary
