We want to be broken
Cleansed by your grace
Our hearts are now open
So meet us in His place
Here is my life
Like clay to the potter
Here is my
Make me to be what you want me to be in your hands
We long for your presence
Washed by your peace
Bring us to your mercy
Take this suffering
Here is my life
Like clay to the potter
Here is my life
Maybe to be what you want me to be in your hands
In your hands
Here is my life
Here is my life
Like clay to the powder
Here is my
Make me to be what you want me to be
Just make me to be what you want me to be
In your hands, in your hands
In your hands, in your hands
