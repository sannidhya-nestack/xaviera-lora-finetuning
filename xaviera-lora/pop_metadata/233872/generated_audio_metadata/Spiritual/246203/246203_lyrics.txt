God got a hold of my heart
God got a hold of my heart
He took me, shook me, pulled me out of the dark
God got a hold of my heart
Oh, God took a hold of my heart
I had a fire that was burning deep in my soul
And it was totally out of control
I hated the whole world and everything in it
There was nothing that I didn't know
Satan had a death grip on me
He had me down as far as low could go
Oh then Jesus Christ stepped into my life
Touched me and made me whole
God got a hold of my heart
God got a hold of my heart
When he took me he shook me pulled me out of the dark
God got a hold of my heart
Oh God took a hold of my heart
God got a hold of my heart
God got a hold of my heart
And he took me, shook me, put me out of the dark
God got a hold of my heart
Oh, God took a hold of my heart
God got a hold of my heart
God got a hold of my heart
And he took me, shook me, put me out of the dark
God got a hold of my heart
Oh, God took a hold of my heart
Oh, God got a hold of my heart
Oh, God got a hold of my heart
