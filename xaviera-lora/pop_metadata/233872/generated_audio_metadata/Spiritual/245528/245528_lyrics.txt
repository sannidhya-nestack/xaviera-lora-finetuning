The world that we live in can be so cold and grey
People are just crumbled up
And thrown away
I've decided that's not gonna happen
Anywhere my light can reach
I'm gonna open up my heart
To the people close to me
And let it pour my love out over each
I'm gonna shine
Each and every moment, feelin' like I own it
At the start of every day, I'm gonna shine
Cover all the rough parts, comfort all the broke hearts
Show them what it's like to just shine
A beacon in a harbor, a single ray of light
Heart full of hopeful, waiting in the night
A face held up to heaven, right where there's a wrong
I've decided that I'm going to have to be that strong
To make this world a place where I belong
Yeah, I'm gonna shine
Each and every moment
Feeling like I own it
At the start of every day
I'm gonna shine
Cover all the rough parts
Comfort all the broke hearts
Show them what it's like
To just shine
Faithfulness and duty, ignorance and beauty
All of these opportunities to hold my head up high, shine
Each and every moment, feeling like I own it
At the start of every day, I'm gonna shine
Cover all the rough parts, comfort all the broke hearts
Show them what it's like to just shine
Lord, I'm going to try to just shine
