Thinking of you gives me rest

Oh, I never shall et
You were my righteousness
Oh, Jesus

Oh, you picked me up out of the mud
Put me in the holy ghost tub

Nothing can separate me from your love

You healed my wound and hurts
That's why I put you first
You redeemed me from the curse
Nothing can separate me from your love

With my heart, my soul, my strength, I love you
