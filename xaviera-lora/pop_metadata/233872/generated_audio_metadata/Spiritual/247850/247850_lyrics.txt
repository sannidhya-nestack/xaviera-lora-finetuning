Did you hear what they did to him?
Did you hear what they did to him?
Nailed him to a cross and left him alone to die
Oh they put him on a cross
And his people felt the loss
They asked why would they do this to him
His chances are looking pretty dim (pretty dim)
But the believers won't give up (won't give up)
They dance all around so he can clearly see
All of them doing the Jesus boogie (Jesus boogie)
All of them doing the Jesus boogie (Jesus Boogie)
All of them doing the Jesus boogie
Oh they stayed through the dark
Cleaned the wounds where nails left their mark
And they asked the Lord, "Will you be back?"
And they danced till the morning light
Gave them water till the Lord had no more fight
But then they heard the good Lord begin to speak
Go forth and spread the word to the weak
Use this dance to show them I'll be back
He said one more time,'cause I want to see
All of them, do the Jesus book here
All of them do the Jesus Book (Jesus Book)
All of them do the Jesus Book (Jesus Book, yeah)
All of them do the Jesus Book (Jesus Book yeah)
All of them do the Jesus Book (Jesus Book), yeah
All of them do the Jesus Book (Jesus Book,) yeah
All of them do the Jesus Book (Jesus Book, yeah)
All of them doing the Jesus Book here
All of them doing the Jesus Book here
