Yeah, yeah, yeah
So far this time
Things are just the same
And he don't look back
When he can turn away
He can lie and say he's stronger
He can lie
Just outside of Boston and north of Tennessee
In a place that I've never been
This is a man, a tired man
With a boy that I've never met
Stare down at your fingers and down to your toes
And grab your aching ears
And wonder where you came from and where you're going
And how you ended here
So he lies and says he's stronger after all this time
He can lie and say he's better
So he makes up his mind, lied to waste all his time
Trying to find the answers to this pain, yeah
But to fall one more time is to lose one more life
And he can't afford that now, not today
And his dismal complexion spoke of the decades of rejection and all that he'd gone through
And he says, "I've lost all sense of meaning in the permanent retreating of a woman that I thought I knew"
He can lie and say he's stronger after all this time
He can lie and say he's better, he's so much better
The days last so long
In the air
So he makes up his mind not to waste all his time
Trying to find the answers to this pain
But to fall one more time is to lose one more life
And he can't afford that now, not today, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah
And he can love
And he can love, he can see
This is not too late
And he can find all the love he needs
He says restore my soul and heal my mind
Replace all the anger inside, inside
He says restore my soul and heal my mind (replace all the anger inside)
He says restore my soul and heal my mind
Replace all the anger inside, inside
He says restore my soul and heal my mind
Replace all the anger inside, inside
