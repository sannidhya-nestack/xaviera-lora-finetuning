If I had the chance to change the past
Shoot around the sun, unbreak the glass
Straight escape the world at the speed of light
This would be a very different night
If I had it, I would make it right (I would make it right)
I'd flip all of this darkness into light (oh, hey, oh)
If God granted me one single wish (one wish)
One with love I ask and simply just for this
If I had the power in my hands
If I held the key, the universe in my command
The existential void would move my way
And this would be a very different day (If I had it, I would make it)
If I had it, I would make it (Flip all of this darkness into light)
Darkness into light
If God granted me one single wish, the one wish, the one wish
Love I ask Him simply just for this, just this, just this
If I had the chance I'd make it right, yeah
I'd flip all of this darkness into light
If God granted me one single wish (one wish, just one wish, man)
Love I'd ask Him simply just for this (all I ever need is this, the one wish)
If I had it I wouldn't give it (if I, if I, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (if I had it I wouldn't give it)
If I (the fall of this darkness into the light) (if I-if I-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no)
Now if God can't give me one single wish
Just the one wish
Love I'd ask him simply just for this
Just this one wish
If I had it I would make it right
The one wish
One wish, I'd flip all of this darkness into light (yeah, oh, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no, no, no (mmm)
If God granted me one single wish (just one wish, baby, all I ever need is this love)
