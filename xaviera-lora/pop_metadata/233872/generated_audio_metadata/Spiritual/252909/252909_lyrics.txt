I've never been too good at facing my fears
Not one step'til all the avenues are clear
I've been living my life behind a screen
Nothing out and nothing in, no damage I can see
But I've heard it said
Safe is just the same as dead
I know it in my head
And my heart will learn in time
I will risk it all
You drove all my doubts away
And I will risk it all
Just to hear you say
That you will love me in spite of all my fears
And I will risk it all knowing you'll be here
You've always been so good
At sharing openly
I know it's hard for you to understand me
That night you came to me still feels like a dream
I think that was the bravest thing that I've ever seen
And I remember you said
Safe is just the same as dead
I know it in my head
And with your love I'll learn in time
I will risk it all
You drove all my doubts away
And I will risk it all
Just to hear you say
That you will love me in spite of all my fears
And I will risk it all knowing you'll be here
Change has never come easily
But now I'm ready to believe in you and me
I will risk it all
You drove all my doubts away
And I will risk it all
Just to hear you say
That you will love me in spite of all my fears
And I will risk it all knowing you'll be here
I will risk it all knowing you'll be here
