Well, well, well, I got someone to talk about, yeah
And I love him, I love him, I love him
Oh yeah, he's alright
Say if you're looking for the love I've found
Let me tell you right now he's not just anyone
He's someone amazing, I've got to praise him
Tell you what he's done for me, it makes me wee
Sometimes I even cry
When I think of his love and sacrifice
He gave his life for all of us
Boy that's tough if you think it's not enough
You'll never know his love'cause
His love is all I need
His love means more to me than anything
I love him, I love him
He means the world to me (He means the world to me)
His love brings me so much joy (so much joy)
His love, boy oh boy (boy oh boy)
I thank you Lord (I wanna thank you) for loving me
He's been my love and my best friend
He's someone who'll be there'til the very end
There's nothing that he can't do
All my life he's seen me through
He's been the center of my life
But it makes me
Sometimes I want to cry
When I think of his love and sacrifice
He gave his life for all of us
Boy that's tough
If you think it's not enough
He'll never know
his love is all I need (all I need)
His love means more to me than anything
I love him (I love you)
He means the world to me (He means the world to me, yeah, yeah, yeah)
His love brings me so much joy (oh, so much joy, joy, joy, joy)
His love, boy oh boy (boy oh boy, yeah)
I thank you Lord (oh, I thank you Lord) for loving me (loving me, loving me)
I can go on and on about what He's done for me
But you gotta have a relationship
Experience and see that he's more than just a fantasy
More than just hype to me
It's about the blood on Calvary
It gives me so much joy
And boy oh boy, if you only knew what I'd do
You'd feel the same way too
Yes, I know you would
About his love curve
His love is all I need (His love)
His love means more to me than anything
I love him (I love you Lord)
