You are the one
You deserve all my praises
You are the one
You are God and I was made to praise
Praise you, praise you, praise you
With thankfulness for your goodness
With anthems loud and joyful tones
I'll bring you praise and sing till I
Surround my life with silent stones
You are the one (You are the one)
I will praise you Messiah
You are the one (You are the one)
If I would rain, the rocks would cry out
Praise you, praise you, praise you, praise you
With thankfulness for your goodness
With anthems loud and joyful tones
I'll bring you praise and sing till I
Surround my life with silent stones
With thankfulness for your goodness
With anthems loud in joyful tones
I'll bring you praise and sing till I
Surround my life with silent stones
And I was made to praise you, praise you, praise you, praise you
With thankfulness for your goodness
With anthems loud and joyful tones
I'll bring you praise and sing to life
Surround my life with silent stones
With thankfulness for your goodness
All the love and mercy you have shown
I'll bring you praise and sing to life
Surround with silent stones
Surround, surround my life with silent stones (silent stones)
