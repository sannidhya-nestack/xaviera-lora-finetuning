I bumped into an old friend of mine
I hadn't seen him in a long, long time
He'd become quite the business man
He drove a Rolls and a Chevy Sedan, yeah
He told me everything he'd been up to
And then he smiled and said, "How about you?"
I told him I'm working on a reservation
A reservation to heaven
I don't know the side of my destination
I'm working on a reservation to heaven
Ooh yeah
You told me everything I said rang true
You said I wish I was more like you
I told him there's really nothing to it
Every day you just go out and do it
And when you feel like you're going wrong
You pray to God for the strength to keep on, oh yeah
Keep working on a reservation
A reservation to heaven
Don't lose sight of your destination
Keep working on a reservation to heaven
I don't have much in the way of money
But there's no money in heaven honey
Oh yeah, hey
When temptation makes you go astray
Let the Lord help you find your way
Oh yeah, you gotta
Keep working on the reservation
Reservation, hey
Don't decide of your destination
Keep working on a reservation to heaven
Keep working on a reservation, reservation to heaven
Don't decide of your destination
Keep working on a reservation to heaven
Keep workin'
Around the face of heaven
Oh, heaven, heaven
Ooh, keep workin'
Heaven
