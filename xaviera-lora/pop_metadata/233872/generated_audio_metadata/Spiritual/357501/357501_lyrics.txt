We fall and kneel before your throne
We bow to you and you alone
And your ways are much higher than the skies
Your love has saved our lives
Adoration, we lift adoration, and all we want is you
Open all our eyes to your glory
Adoration, we lift adoration, and all we need is you
Come before you God with one voice
And these songs were only melody before
You taught us how to sing
And your blood has purified each line
And your love
Has saved our lives and that's why we cry in adoration
We live in adoration
All we want is you
Open all our eyes to your glory
Adoration, we lift adoration
And all we need is you
To come before your God with one voice
And in the morning
We will sing your praise
In the shadows
We will cry your name
Holy Father
Holy King of all, so worthy of praise
Adoration, we lift adoration
All we want is you
Open all our eyes to your glory
Adoration, we lift adoration
And all we need is you, to come before your God
All we need is you, to come before your God with one voice
