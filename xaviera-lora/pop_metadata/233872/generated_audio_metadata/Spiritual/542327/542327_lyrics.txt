As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the starry crown
Good Lord show me the way
Oh sisters, let's go down, let's go down, come on down
Oh sisters, let's go down, down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the starry crown
Good Lord show me the way
Oh brothers let's go down
Let's go down come on down
Oh brothers let's go down
Down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the starry crown
Good lord show me the way
Oh fathers, let's go down, let's go down, come on down
Oh fathers, let's go down, down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the starry crown
Good Lord show me the way
Oh mothers let's go down
Let's go down
Come on down
Oh mothers let's go down
Down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the starry crown
Good Lord show me the way
Oh sinners let's go down
Let's go down come on down
Oh sinners let's go down
Down in the river to pray
