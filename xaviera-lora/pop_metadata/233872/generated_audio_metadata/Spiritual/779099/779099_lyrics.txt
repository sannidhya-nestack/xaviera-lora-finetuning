Would you know him if he looked like one more lonely, tattered man
Would you listen if he stopped to try to tell you of his plan
Would you know him if you saw him lying on a steaming grate
I hope it's not too late for you to know him
Can you find him even in the eyes of your worst enemy
Just remember the last word in enemy is me
Would you know him?
Would he know you?
Would you know him?
If you saw him walking through a desert land
If he told his secrets would you understand?
Can you find him even in the eyes of your worst enemy?
Just remember the last word in it on me is me
Would you know him if he looked a little like you and me
Would you know him
If he left his crown of thorns at Calvary
If he left his crown of thorns at Calvary
Would you know him?
