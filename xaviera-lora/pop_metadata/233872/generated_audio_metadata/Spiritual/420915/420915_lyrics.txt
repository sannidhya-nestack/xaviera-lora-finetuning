He just said to Jesus, leave me Lord, I'm a sinful man
He just said to Jesus, leave me Lord, oh I'm a sinful man
Lord said to Peter, feed my precious lambs
They're seeing a valley about to throw the very first stone
A Pharisee refining
About to throw the very first stone
The Lord said to the sinner
Oh, won't you go and sin no more?
I cried out to God, please take this thorn out of my flesh
I cried out to God, please take this thorn out of my flesh
Lord said my grace is sufficient
But take no provision for the flesh
No provision for the flesh
Just gotta put your trust in Jesus
Precious Lord, take my hand
