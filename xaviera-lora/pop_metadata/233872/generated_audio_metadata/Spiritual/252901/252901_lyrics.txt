Why can't I get out of bed this morning?
These flimsy sheets seem to weigh a ton
I try to move but I'm paralyzed by something
Something buried deep in my own deceit
About the person I've become
I cry out loud for the strength to face my demons
Oh Lord my God you know what's ailing me
I try to hide, but inside my soul is screaming
Lord deliver me, baptize me, set me free
And wash away all the layers of dust that have settled over me
Wash away all the secret thoughts I don't want you to see
Wash away
The complacency until I'm overcome
By the healing waters of your grace
Your wave of truth, let it knock me over backwards
Till I'm immersed and careening toward the falls
Lord, rescue me, I'm ready to surrender
Hold me in your arms, my loving savior, now and forever
And wash away all the layers of dust that have settled over me
Wash away all the secret thoughts I don't want you to see
Wash away
The complacency until I'm overcome
By the healing waters of your grace
For so many years I've coveted
The path of least resistance
Couldn't see the plans you had for me
Till my heart was opened wide
I've walked the walk and talked the talk
But I've never gone the distance
But now I'm finally ready to
Begin a brand new life
And wash away all the layers of dust that have settled over me
Wash away all the secret thoughts I don't want you to see
Wash away the complacency until I'm overcome by the healing waters of my heart
Healing waters of your grace
Healing waters of your grace
Healing waters of your grace
Healing waters
