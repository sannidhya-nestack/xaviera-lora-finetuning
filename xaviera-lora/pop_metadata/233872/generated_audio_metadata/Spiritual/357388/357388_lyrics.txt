She strolled along a bustling avenue
To a shanty bar at the edge of town
She did not know
Just a nothing girl from a nothing home
Living in a nothing world
Stepping off a bus bound for Chicago
At the time I had time, time enough to spend
Well excuse me ma'am but may I ask your name?
She had a past that was clearly shown on her face
And a voice that screamed the years
The endless years of shame
And what could she think when all that she was
Was in the lightning of another drink
And I wanted her to follow the rules
And I wanted her to love my Jesus
The way I've come to
Oh, it's just another misfit
And another crazy sinner
Who's lost the idea of a family life
But if only you could see the dance of pain in her eyes
Or hear the screams for mercy
She's trying so hard to hide
I'm getting so tired of the same old scene
Of another lost child and one wicked dream
If I'd only remembered one screaming thing
There once was a lost soul who looked a lot, a lot like me
under it all we're all just the same
And we've all played our parts and carried our blame
We're all great big liars and prostitute slaves
Until one great big God paid for all of our chains, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Ha-a-a-a-a-a-a
