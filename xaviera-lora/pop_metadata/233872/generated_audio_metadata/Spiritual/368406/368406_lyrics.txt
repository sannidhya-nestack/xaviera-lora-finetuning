The doors are open, come on in and sit down
I got something to tell ya, listen good
Concentrate on what I gotta say
There's been some confusion by the preachers on TV
Urge folks to send money for a message that is free
There's no secret number for Jesus, fly with the lion
Talk to him directly by praying anytime, yeah, I said come on
Ain't no restaurant, there ain't no restaurant
Jesus never wore Rolex, no silk designer suits
He was into Roman sandals, not alligator boots
Never showed him a limo for a red carpet affair
JC rides in light-gold Jones, I was jackass too, fair fair,'cause heaven
Ain't no restin' around the same feet, no A to D, don't worry, you're gonna get in for free
You don't need a shirt or shoes, no bouncers out front door
no one is refused (no one is refused)
No one
The samples were his party
He didn't speak and rap
He's arrested by the authorities
With nothing like two packs
About to bake in Vegas
He only played outdoor events
He didn't need no sound man stage
Or any kind of tent
Cause hell yeah
Ain't no rest in the lot, safety don't lay the deed
Don't worry you're gonna get it free
You don't need shirts or shoes, bouncers at the front door
no one, no one, no one, no one is refused
Not here, we don't refuse anybody
You don't have to send nobody, you're not refused
Everybody
Got a call the other week and it was from JC
He said I got my dad up here I'll tell you what he's peed
All these folks are running around taking things from me
Asking all these humble folks to pay for what I scream
I'm telling you I don't like it
They better stop playing fair
Cause I'm coming down I'm telling you
It's no solo movie
Heaven ain't no restaurant, safety no vanity
Don't worry you're gonna get in for free
You'll need no shirt, no shoes, no bouncers at the front door
no one, no one, no one is a real cat ghost
Alright just throw yourself down on your knees
Put your hands together and pray
You don't need to send no money
You don't need to send no TV, fiction, no money
Just go down on your knees and put your hands together and pray hard
I want to say something else but I won't say it, alright?
I was going to say pray like hell, alright?
But if you don't want to pray like hell, I'm the man down below
