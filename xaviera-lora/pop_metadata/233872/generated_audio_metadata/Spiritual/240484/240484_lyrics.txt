When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain I count but loss
And poor contempt on all my pride
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
Save in the death of Christ my God
All the vain things that charm me most
I sacrifice them to His blood
See from his head, his hands, his feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did a such love and sorrow meet
And forms compose so rich a crown
Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were a gift by far too small
Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, I liked my all
