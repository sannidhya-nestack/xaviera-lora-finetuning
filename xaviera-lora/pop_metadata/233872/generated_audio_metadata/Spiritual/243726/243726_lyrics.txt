Wash over me, cover me
I beg you to take me
And mold me into a form of you
Wash over me, cover me, I beg you to take me
Come again to me and bind me to you
To keep the vow I made one precious summer night so long ago
On a mountain so far away
So long otten and so twisted
By the time that I must say
I can't recall which I had said I'd do
Live for me or die for you
Wash over me, cover me, I beg you to take me
And hold me into a form of you
Wash over me, cover me, I beg you to take me
Come again to me and bind me to you
I've spent so long in looking back
I've missed what's here before me now
Break the bondage of yesterday
(There's a day) I'm full of pain, I can't release
You are my only hope today
So now I make a promise that is new (that is new)
Die to me and live for you
And still I know it's not a choice that I can make alone
It has to be your spirit's work and not my own
Wash over me, cover me, I beg you to take me
And mold me into a form of you (into a form of you)
Wash over me
Cover me, I beg you to take me
Come again to me and bind me to you (to you)
Come again to me and bind me to you
