When the sun this morning arose
My afflicted heart gave you praise
For He who writes upon the highest heavens
Sings me songs in the night
Whom have I in heaven but Thee
And besides Thee there is none
My flesh and my heart may fail but my God
Is the strength of my heart
I'll be strong in the night
For thus when the stars are the brightest in the sky
I'll be strong by His might
I know that He holds me so tight in His arms
As He sings over me by night a lullaby
All, all are thine
Lord, by day
His loving kindness
Will be mine
He will be mine
As for me, the nearness of God is all the good I desire
You are my refuge, my portion forever in thee
I'll rest awhile, I'll be strong in the night
For thus when the stars are the brightest in the sky
I'll be strong by his might
I know that He holds me so tight in His arms
As He sings over me by night a lullaby
And all the bad
On my death
These loving kinds
Will be mine
You will be mine
