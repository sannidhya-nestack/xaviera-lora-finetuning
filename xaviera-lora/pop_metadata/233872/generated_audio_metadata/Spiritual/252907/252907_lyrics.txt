To the golden cross
That hangs beside the doorbell
Then with conviction
And hope in his eyes
He rang and silence fell
Oh, I'm peerin' through the keel
I'm nervous and uneasy, oh
Has my welcome mat lost its meaning?
My front door is asking God to bless this house
But I lock that door, don't wanna let those blessings out
I am the judge and jury
And I'm in no hurry to explore
The other side of my front door
She cleared her throat
And wheeled herself around
And parked beside the doorbell
Pamphlets on her lap and clipboard in her hand
Is it God or magazine she's gonna sell?
Ooh, I'm peering through the keyhole
Ooh, I'm nervous and uneasy
Ooh, I'm nervous and uneasy
Has my welcome mat lost its meaning?
My front door is asking God to bless this house
But I lock that door, don't wanna let those blessings out
I am the judge and jury and I'm in no hurry to explore
The other side of my front door is asking God to bless this house
I lock that door but I gotta let those blessings out
I've been judge and jury
And I've been in no hurry to explore
The other side of my front door
