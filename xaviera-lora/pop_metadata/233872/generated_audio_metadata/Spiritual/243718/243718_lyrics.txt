You never pass a lonely soul you fail to greet
The gardener pulling weeds, the beggar on the street
The ones who seem invisible, the addicts gone astray
I never really noticed them until you stopped to pray
And when I asked you why you seem to always care
You could only answer
I've been there, I've been there
I begged to die in pain no one could share
I felt the wounds, I kept the scars
I can meet them where they are
I can feel their pain
I've been there
So many times I see the tears fill wounded eyes
A church has thrown them out
Are filled their mind with lies
They feel they are invisible
Their hearts have grown so hard
Abandoned by their families
Because of who they are
Jesus, how can you reach through such despair?
Then I hear you answer
I've been there, I've been there
I begged to die in pain no one could share
I felt the wounds, I took the scars
I can meet you where you are
I can feel your pain'cause I've been there
It took the cross (it took the cross)
It took the shame (all shame)
It took my blood so you would know that I felt your pain
I've been there, I've been there
I begged to die in pain no one could share
I felt the wounds, I kept the scars
I can meet you where you are
I can heal your pain'cause I've been there
Christ says don't leave before you say a simple prayer
You can come from death to life'cause I've been there
Ooh, I've been there
