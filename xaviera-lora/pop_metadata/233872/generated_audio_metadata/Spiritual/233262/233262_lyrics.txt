There comes a time when a man must take his place in the sun
In the sun
Marked is the day
That is set along the way
For each sun
In the sun
There is a path that you must choose
Choose between the two
Take the one in the sun
You will receive
If only you believe
In the one
He's the sun
Stand up, receive the power
In your hearts, stand up, rejoice
Now your time has come
There is a light
Shining in the light is for you
Sister true
Reach with your heart
And make a brand new start
He's the one
He's the sun
Stand up
Receive His power in your hearts
Receive the power for the time has come
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
Praise Him
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor.
He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind,
to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.
Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.
What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer
