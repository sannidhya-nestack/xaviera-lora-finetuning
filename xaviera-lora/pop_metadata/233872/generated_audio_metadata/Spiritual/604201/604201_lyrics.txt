Jesus, Jesus, majesty, take this song up high
May this melody bring you joy, may this song reach to the sky
All the wonder's words declare that you are the king
How you can restore a life, you are our everything, ooh
I was about to run far away, but you were following me
You were passionate all the way
And you got me on my knees
Jesus, Jesus, majesty
Take this song up high
May this melody
May this melody bring you joy
May this song reach to the sky
All the wonder's words declare that you are the key
How you can restore a life, you are our everything
I was about to leave this world
For no solution comes my way, he said
Hold on my daughter, he called out my name
And told me to obey
Jesus, Jesus, majesty
Take this song up high
May this melody bring you joy
May this song reach to the sky
All the wonder's words declare that you are the king
How you can restore a life
You are our everything

You are our everything
You are our everything
