Abide with me, fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, oh abide with me
Night surely comes to end this passing day
Earth's joys grow dim
Its glories pass away
Change and decay
In all around I see
O Lord, who does not change
Abide with me
I need your presence every passing hour
What else but grace can foil temptation's path?
Who else like you will guide and stay with me?
Through cloud and sunshine, oh, abide with me
I have no fear with you close by each day
Trouble and sorrow
Swiftly pass away
And at my end
Death will not conquer me
For I shall live if you abide with me
Your holy cross, your resurrection
Come shining through the gloom
With hope, salvation
Heaven's morning breaks
And earth's vain shadows flee
In death, O Lord, abide with me
