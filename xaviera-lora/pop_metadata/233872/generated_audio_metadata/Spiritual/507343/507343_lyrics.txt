He's thinking'bout his memories
His every thought, his every dream
And the guilt that lies in between
He's trying to figure out why it scares him to think about himself
The light in his eyes is gone
But the night lives on, on
You so called hero
A reflection of the one I used to know
Mister, mister everything
Wouldn't stop at anything
All you have is emptiness
But I guess it's never that simple
When the devil calls your name
You so called hero
Descending into madness when darkness blows you that first kiss
And it leaves nothing left, nothing left to reminisce
'Cause the light in his eyes is gone
But the night lives on in you, so-called hero
A reflection of the one I used to know
Mister, mister everything
Who wouldn't stop at anything
All you have is emptiness
But I guess it's never that simple
You're so cold, hero
You're so cold, hero
Mister Wonderful
Mister Everything
It didn't have to be this way
You could've been my hero
You so called, you so called hero
Mister, mister everything
Wouldn't stop at anything
All you have is emptiness
But I guess it's never that simple
