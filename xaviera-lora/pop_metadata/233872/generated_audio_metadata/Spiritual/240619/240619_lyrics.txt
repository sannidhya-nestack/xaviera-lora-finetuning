Remove the mask from which you hide
Show me what you feel inside
Help the ones that you have hurt
Show us all what you have learned
It's all about loyalty, it's all about dignity
It's all about sovereignty when we realize
It's all about loyalty, it's all about dignity
It's all about sovereignty when we realize
Resurrection can't deny
Blood that flows for you and I
Raise the one that tells the truth
Hear the words that call for you
It's all about loyalty, it's all about dignity
It's all about sovereignty when we realize
It's all about loyalty, it's all about dignity
It's all about sovereignty when we realize
You cannot see it, you can only feel it
Only you can create it
Otherwellers will hate it
You must never deny it
You must sacrifice for it
If it is eternal
Then you are eternal
Now that you have seen the light
You know that you have to fight
Fight for freedom and the truth
Fight for what belongs to you
It's all about sanctity, it's all about destiny
Of the one that was spread to me when we realized
It's all about sanctity, it's all about destiny
Of the one that was spread to me when we realized
You cannot see it, you can only feel it
Only you can create it, all the others will hate it
You must never deny it, you must sacrifice for it
If it is eternal, then you are eternal
