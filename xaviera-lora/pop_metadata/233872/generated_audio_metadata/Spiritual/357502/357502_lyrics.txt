Why are you so cold? Why are you so cold?
Why are you so cold? Why are you so cold?
Come on all you people sing a song
Of what our God has done
Of what our God has done for us
Come on all you sinners sing along
We'll find that we belong
Because of what he's done for us
He has saved us by his sacrifice
And these dead bones are bursting into life
So God over all the elements
Greater than we could comprehend
We lift you up
We lift you up
Father to all the fatherless
Perfect unending holiness
We lift you up
We lift you up
Father, we stare and wonder at your son
And all that he has done
All that he has done for us
Jesus, for the sinners you have won
And a new song can be sung
Because of what you've done for us
You have saved us by your sacrifice
And these dead bones are bursting into life
Soul God over all the elements
Greater than we could comprehend
We lift you up
Oh we lift you up
Father to all the fatherless
In perfect unending holiness
We lift you up
Oh we lift you up
Hear the sound
Of the saints offering to you, offering to you, oh yeah
Sound of the saints singing out to you, singing out to you
So God over all the elements
Greater than we could comprehend
We lift you up
Oh we lift you up
Father to all the fatherless
Perfect unending holiness
We lift you up
Oh we lift you up
God over all the elements
Greater than we could comprehend
Lord, we lift you up
Father to all the fatherless
In perfect unending holiness
We lift you up, oh, we lift you up
