You
Ooh, it's like love
Ooh, you're my heaven and
Hey
When the good times seem to end
And you feel like in a foreign land
I tell you sister and brother to keep the faith
Heaven and earth will pass away
But my words will never pass away
That's what my Jesus said
When the good times seem to end
And you feel like you're in a foreign land
Heaven and earth would pass away
But my words would never pass away
That's what my Jesus said
Rise to fool your mind
Stay on course and don't be blind
Who is like the Lord God?
Majesty
Who is like the Lord God
Bless his name
No one is like you, God
Free me from
Free me from
The trap that's set for me
Into your hands
You commit my spirit hopefully
Redeem me
Oh Lord, the God of truth
Heaven and earth will pass away
But my words will never pass away
That's what my Jesus said
When evil tries
When evil tries
Sister and brother, brother stay on course (Stay on course and don't be blind)
Open your eyes (Who is like the Lord God)
Sing about majesty and God (Majesty and God)
Who is like the Lord? (Who is like the Lord?)
Majesty of God (Majesty of God)
Majesty of God (Who is like)
Majesty, majesty, oh God
I just wanna sing it one more time
I wanna worship your Lord, oh God
Sing it one more time, majesty, oh God
Majesty, majesty, oh God
