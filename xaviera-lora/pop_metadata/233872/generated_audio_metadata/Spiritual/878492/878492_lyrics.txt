Aren't you the same guy that I knew when I was young
Taught me how to love and to ive
I still imagine you, wise old man in a shiny robe
Telling us how we should live
And aren't you the same guy that I used to pray to every night
And wonder why I never heard from you
Things are getting just a little crazy now
I wonder why you do the things you do
But every night I still pray
Hoping one day that I'll hear you say
Heaven is waiting my son I've not otten you
I will be with you my son all the trials you go through
I will be with you
How can you justify disease and destruction?
Tearing innocent families apart
And how can you justify a baby born addicted
Never had a chance from the start
You shake the earth, the waters overflow
You make the wind blow so hard that it shatters every dream
You stop the rain, you make the drought
Leaving all without
Can't you hear the hungry babies scream
But every night I still pray
Hoping one day that I'll hear you say
Heaven is waiting my son I've not otten you
I will be with you my son all the trials you go through
I will be with you
Aren't you the guy that let my best friend kill herself?
Seems that she had more than she could take
Why couldn't you help her?
And aren't you the same guy that let my poor daddy suffer?
For years, you didn't have the strength to speak
I miss you dad
But every night I still pray
Hoping one day I'll hear you say
Heaven is waiting my son
I've not otten you
I will be with you my son all the trials you go through
Heaven is waiting, my son, I've not otten you
I will be with you
I will be with you
I will be with you
I will be with you, my son
Heaven is waiting my son
