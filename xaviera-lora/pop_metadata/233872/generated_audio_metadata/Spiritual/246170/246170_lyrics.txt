On the distant shores of Sharon
Waits the song I long to hear
the labor's song of freedom
Softly whispering in my ear
My heart yearns to feel the joy
When I hear the Savior's voice
Gently calling, "Faithful servant, come on home"
Weary soldiers
Love the Savior, rest your souls at Jesus' feet
Where we'll hear the songs of freedom
Sung by angels, soft and sweet
With our brothers gone before
We will sing forevermore
Songs of freedom
Sing forever when we're home
On the distant shores of Sharon
Waits the song I long to hear
the victor's
Song of freedom gently dancing in my ears when this life can
Sing no more, I will stand upon that shore
Where my Savior's voice will lead me
Take me home, Lord, take me home
