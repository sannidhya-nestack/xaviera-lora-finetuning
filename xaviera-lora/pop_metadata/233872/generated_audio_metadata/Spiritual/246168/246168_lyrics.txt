We wallow in the lives of men
To seek the face of those within
The wisdom of our eyes
But man cannot salvation win
by the grace of God we're in
Our true salvation lies, Alleluia
Hallelujah to Christ the King
Sacrificed everything
Conquered death and now we bring
Sacrifices to the King
Hallelujah
Anointed of the Father's hand
Within the grave the Christ did stand
The souls of men to free
Through darkest night Messiah trod
To reign beside the living God
The God of fathers three, Alleluia
Hallelujah to Christ the King
Sacrificed everything
Conquered death and now we bring
Sacrifices to the King
Hallelujah to Christ the King
Sacrificed everything
Conquered death and now we bring
Sacrifices to the King, Hallelujah
