-Bye. -Bye, bye, appreciate it.
No matter what time it is
No matter if day or night
No matter
No matter if it's dead or glad
It's time to rest in the light
Sing it one more time
No matter what time it is
No matter if day or night
No matter
No matter if it's dead or glad
It's time to rest in the light
No matter what you think
No matter what you think
No matter what you feel
No matter what you feel
The more you fear not worth it
The more his grace can heal
He's a healer, he's a healer, he's a healer
Come on, come on, go ahead
Let the praise begin in the midst of your soul
Come on let the praise begin
Let praise begin and let Jesus take control
Let the praise begin in the midst of your soul
Let the praise begin
No matter (no matter what time it is)
No matter if day or night
Eh, no matter (no matter if you're sad or glad)
It's time to rest in the light
No matter what you think (no matter what you think)
No matter what you feel (no matter what you feel)
The more you fear not worth it
The more His grace can give
my God is a healer
Come on and let the praise begin
In the midst of your soul
Let the praise begin
And let Jesus take us in His Kingdom
One more time
Let the praise begin in the midst of your soul
Let the praise begin in the midst of the night (peaceworthy)
Let the praise begin in the midst of the night
Let the praise, let the praise begin
Give Him glory, give Him glory
Give Him, give Him, give Him, give Him glory
In the midst of your soul, in the midst of your soul
Let the praise begin
Here we go again (Let the praise begin) (In the midst of your soul)
Let the praise begin (Let the praise begin) on your Monday (Let the praise begin) on your Tuesday (Let the praise begin) all the days of the week (Let the praise begin)
Let the praise begin in the midst, in the midst (In the midst of your soul) oh (Let the praise begin) let the praise begin (Let the praise begin)
