There are times in your life when it seems not worth the fight you wanna give in
You don't care if you win but something deep down inside
Keeps pushing you higher
And you make up your mind
To give it just one more time
You've come too far to turn back
Don't let your passion relapse
Let it grow so the world will know
Reach in your heart and find it
Reclaim your gift, fight for it
It's your time to claim your prize
You've already won a true champion
You're a winner, a strong survivor
Keep going on
You've already won, Olympia
Never stop striving, always keep trying until it's done
You've already won
sometimes you're tight
And you wanna throw in the towel
But your heart says not now
Life happens, distractions come along the way
But you pick yourself up and you go on anyway
You've come too far to turn back
Don't let your passion relax
Let it grow so the world will know
Oh, reach in your heart and find it
Reclaim your gift, fight for it
It's your time to claim your prize
You've already won a true champion
You're a winner, a strong survivor
Keep going on
You've already won, Olympian
Never stop striving, always keep trying until it's done
You've already won, you've already won
You've already won
You've already won
Don't stop until it's done
You've already won
