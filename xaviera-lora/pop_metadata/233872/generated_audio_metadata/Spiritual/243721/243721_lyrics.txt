I came to know you early, I was young and full of care
Dying to be saved from my despair
My life hung in the balance, I cried out to you in prayer
I needed to be saved and you were there
And I cried Savior, I cried save me
My life an open door, my heart an open door
I found salvation, I found safe harbor
When I was young I learned to call you Savior
Then I perceived your power, learned your mercy and your grace
I came to know your miracles in us
You called life into being
Your word will calm the storm
The sovereign over all, my Lord Jesus
And I sing
I sing praise you (praise you)
My life an open book
My heart an open door
Evil is vanquished
Your love is outpoured
As I grew I learned to say Savior and Lord
The years have passed between us
I have learned to know your voice
When I'm afraid I don't need to pretend
My heart is yours, I've found love others cannot comprehend
Today I call you Savior, Lord and friend
I call you Jesus
Jesus, stay beside me (stay beside me)
A brother's loving hand
To hold mine to the end
You call me loving
You hold me in your arms and call me friend (call me friend) you hold me in your arms and call me friend
