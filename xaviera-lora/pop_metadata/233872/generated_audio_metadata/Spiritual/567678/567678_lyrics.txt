Folks call him the pavement parson
Cause he preaches to the sidewalk crowd
His clothes are old and ragged, reads the good book right out loud
Some drop coins, most pass by, he never gets depressed
When I asked what keeps him going
He said, "Son, I'm heaven blessed"
There's a glory train waiting for you and me
Gonna carry us to salvation
Set our burden free
There's a glory train
That we all can get on board
And we'll ride to the promised land
To be together forevermore
Well I couldn't help but wonder
About the story of his life
So I bought him a cup of coffee to warm his bones
And we talked awhile
He said he was married to an angel
But in her last years she took ill
Though her treatment left him destitute
Her words console him still
There's a glory train waiting for you and me
Gonna carry us to salvation, set our burden free
There's a glory train that we all can get on board
And we'll ride to the promised land to be together
Forevermore
I decided right then and there
To be more thankful for what I have
Get my heart and mouth prepared
To take that journey and I look back
Do all that I can to hold that glory train
Waiting for you and me
Gonna carry us to salvation
Said I'm burning free
There's a glory train
That we all can get on board
And we'll ride to the promised land to be
On that glory train, waiting for you and me
Gonna carry us to salvation, set our burden free
There's a glory train, that we all can get on board
And we'll ride to the promised land to be together
Forevermore, evermore
