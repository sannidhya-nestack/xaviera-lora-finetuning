When I read about the miracles of old
All the wondrous deeds you've done
And all the marvels I've been told
I wonder could you please help me today
My life has been pulled on hold
My dreams they seem so far away
Part the waters one more time for me
I have no boat to sail across
Please guide me through because I'm lost
Part the waters one more time for me
A miracle to rescue me
My dreams lie on the other side of the sea
As you led your people through the wilderness
You were ever by their side
Your presence there to help and guide
I only hope that you're right here with me
I'm asking you please one more time
Take me to the other side
Heart the waters one more time for me
I have no boat to sail across
Please guide me through, because I'm lost
Artful waters, one more time for me
A miracle to rescue me
My dreams lie on the other side of the sea
When I walk upon the solid ground
I'll begin the new life I have found
Part the waters one more time
Part the waters one more time
Part the waters one more time
Part the waters one more time
Part the waters one more time for me
A miracle to rescue me
My dreams fly on the other side of the sea
