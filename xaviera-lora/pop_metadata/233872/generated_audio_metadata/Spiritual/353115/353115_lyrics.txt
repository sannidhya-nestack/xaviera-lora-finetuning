Well, my brothers and my sisters too, let's come together
To spread the news, sweet Jesus
Some they say you're not real, but I know you in my heart
You know how I feel, I said Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, amen, amen, amen
Won't you put your hands together
Well, my brothers and my sisters too
Don't be discouraged
Because Jesus loves you
He'll be your best friend
Best friend you'll ever find
When trouble comes your way
He will not run and hide
I said Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, amen, amen, amen
Won't you put your hands together, sing it!
Everybody sing it now, sing it to the Lord and get ready
Raise your hands in the air and get ready to clap
Sing it, sing it louder children
Stomp your feet to the floor
You got to make the decision
Put your hands together
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Won't you put your hands together
Well my brothers and my sisters too
Let's just believe
That there's a blessed way for you
Remove those mountains
That are standing in your way
Just raise your hands up to the sky
Say in Jesus name
I said Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen, amen, amen, amen
Won't you put your hands together?
Get it! Woo! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen
And some would say, "Amen"
