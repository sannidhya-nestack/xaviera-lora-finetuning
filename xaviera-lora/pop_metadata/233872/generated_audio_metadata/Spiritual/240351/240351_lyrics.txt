Now my soul is troubled
What shall I say
Father save me from this hour
For this cause I came
Father glorify thy name
Glorify thy name
For this cause I came
For this hour
Glorify thy name
I wrestled with my flesh
And I have overcome
I ask you take this cup from me
And now my will be yours be done
Father, glorify thy name
Glorify thy name
It was for this cause I came to this hour
Called by thy name
Well, he came to pay my debt
It was a price I could not afford
He bled and he died and he rose again
And now he is my lord, yeah
And now we've been sent out
To preach the message that he gave
If you believe on him and confess his name
You will be saved
Father, clerk by thy name
Clerk by thy name
It's for this cause I came to this hour
Lord, by thy name
Father, Lord, by thy name
Lord, by thy name
It's for this cause I came to this hour
Lord, by thy name
