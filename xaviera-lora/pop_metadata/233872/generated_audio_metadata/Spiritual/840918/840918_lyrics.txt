Hail Mary, full of grace
The Lord is with you, and blessed
Are you among women?
And blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus
Holy Mary, Mother of God
Pray for us, sin is enough
And dad I find love
Intercede for us, who truly are in need
Pray for us, sin is enough
And at our final hour
We beg of you to kindly help me
Pray for us sinners now
And dad our final hour
Intercede for us who truly are in need
Pray for us sinners now
And dad our final hour
We beg of you to kindly help me
Amen
