Located in your house, one solitary room
It's important, so significant, yet relatively small in size
A place where you can't be alone
In talking to the Lord
Tucked away, a quiet place
Where all your prayers are stored
You and God alone
Can share this treasured space
God, and only God alone
Will wipe the tears from your face
He's always waiting there
Never further than a prayer
Drift inside and share your closet prayer
You and God alone can share this treasured space
And only God alone will wipe the tears from your face
He's always waiting there, never further than a prayer
Drift inside and share
Your closet prayer
Just drift inside
You can share
Your closet prayer
