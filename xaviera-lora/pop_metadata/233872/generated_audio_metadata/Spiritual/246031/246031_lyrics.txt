No wind at the window
No knock on the door
No light from the lampstand
No foot on the floor
No dream born of tiredness
No ghost raised by fear
Just an angel and a woman
And a voice in her ear
Oh Mary, oh Mary, don't hide from my face
Be glad that you're favored and filled with God's grace
The time for me
The world has begun and you are requested to mother go song
This child must be born, for that kingdom shall come
Salvation for many, destruction for some
Both end and begin
Beginning both message and sign
Both victor and victim
Both yours and divine
No payment was promised
No promises made
No wedding was dated
No blueprint displayed
Yet Mary consenting to what none could guess
Replied with conviction, "Tell God I say"
Peace
