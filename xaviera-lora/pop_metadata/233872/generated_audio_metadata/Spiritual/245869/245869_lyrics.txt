Well, the Bible say that Moses was a mighty, mighty man
And he split that ocean with the wave of his hand
Led his people to the promised land
And he did it all at God's command
Move over, move over, move over
Hey, move over to the righteous side
If you want to go to heaven on the day you die
Move over to the righteous side
Now Jonah got swallowed in the belly of the whale
He spent three days in that smelly old jail
the Lord took mercy, throwed his bail
Said Jonah go preach over hill and dale
Move over, move over, move over
I said move over to the righteous side
If you wanna go to heaven on the day you die
Move over to the righteous side
Well, now Daniel got throwed in the lion's den
the king done listened to some wicked men
They said, "I guess that's the end of him"
But Daniel stepped out and said, "Guess again"
Move over, I said move over
Hey, move over
Move over to the righteous side
If you wanna go to heaven on the day you die
Move over to the righteous side
Move over
Move over
Hey move over
Move over to the righteous side
If you wanna go to heaven on the day you die
Even you wanna go to heaven
Don't get in a fight just move over to the righteous
Don't block that light just move over to the righteous
If you're running in the night and you're wasting all your mind on things that ain't right
You better take a hit from the Israelite and move over to the righteous side
Move over to the righteous side
