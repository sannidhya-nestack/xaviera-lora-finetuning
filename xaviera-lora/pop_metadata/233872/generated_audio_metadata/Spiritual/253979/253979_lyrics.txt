Maybe I don't have to worry
And maybe that's just not the best policy
Maybe if I'm not in such a hurry
Open myself up, start listening
Wishing I could block them out
If then who, what, where, when, how
Futuristic questions plague my mind
To be missus or stay miss
Will I have a house, two kids
My preoccupation's well supplied
But now fatigue is setting in
This guessing game I'll never win
But I can't rest'til everything's defined
Maybe it's consuming me
And maybe it's surrounding me
And maybe it's controlling me
But maybe I don't have to worry
Maybe that's just not the best policy
Maybe if I'm not in such a hurry
Open myself up start listening
Fortune telling's not my trade
I know predictions can't be made
So why has this obsession taken hold?
All this time that I've been given
Surely better spent on living
Just sit back and let it all unfold
May bees consume me
And may bees surround me
And may bees consume me
Please control me
But maybe I don't have to worry
Maybe that's just not the best policy
Maybe if I'm not in such a hurry
Open myself up, start listening to you every day
Let you fashion the clay
Maybe I don't have to worry
Maybe that's just not the best policy
Maybe if I'm not in such a hurry
You will show me what I'm missing
