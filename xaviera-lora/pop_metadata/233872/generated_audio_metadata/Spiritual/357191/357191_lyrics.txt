What can we say to describe a glimpse of your glory
How can our words portray but a threat of your majesty
But still we praise our savior in spirit and in truth
But we cannot say enough about you
What can we say to describe a glimpse of your glory
How can our words portray but a threat of your majesty
But still we praise our Savior in spirit and in truth
But we cannot say enough about him
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Oh Lord, oh Lord
But still we praise our Savior
In spirit and in truth
We cannot say enough about Him
Can I say now about you?
Can I say now?
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
