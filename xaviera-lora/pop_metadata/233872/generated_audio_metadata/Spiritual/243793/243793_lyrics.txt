Drop me in the water, Lord, I'm whispering a prayer
Take away my gravity, I'm trusting you for air
Silence has enveloped me, I only hear my breath
Drifting as the current pulls me between life and death
Here in the reef, Lord, show me beauty (show me)
Here beneath the waves, please show me love
Just the point I'm doubting you when I see her swim away
Floating off she hovers like a dove
In her ageless eyes I see
The mysteries of time
Where at least she watches me
We leave the shore behind
We release that world to you
Its busyness and care
Join the creatures of the deep
The stillness is our prayer
Here in the reef, Lord, show me beauty
Here beneath the waves, please show me love
Just the point I'm doubting you I see her swim away
Floating off she hovers like a duck
When I'm drowning in despair
Everyday life my fear
Remind me of the trust you taught me here
Here in the reef, Lord, show me beauty
Here beneath the waves, please show me love
Just the point I'm doubting you when I see her swim away
Floating off she hovers like a dove
Here in the reef please show me love
