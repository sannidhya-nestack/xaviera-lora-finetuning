(Humming)
We sing praise to you, Lord
You're our strength and our song
Hail to God, our Deliverer
You have claimed victory
Your unfailing love will us lead
May your strength and power be our guide
To the holy place by your side
Mighty wonders you show
From your hand, Lord of Lords
Great your power, awesome glory yours
Nations see and bow down
Your unfailing love will last, lead
We the people you have redeemed
May your strength and power be our guide
To the holy place by your side
We sing praise to you, Lord
You're our strength and our song
Hail to God, our deliverer
You
Who have claimed victory
