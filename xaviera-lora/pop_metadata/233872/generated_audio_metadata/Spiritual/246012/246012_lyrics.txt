If I could keep only one, it would be you
I know you miss the promise that I was
It doesn't mean that what is dead is gone
If I had a best friend
If I could keep only one
It would be you
If I could keep only one
If I could keep only one
It would be you
It would be you
There's a part of me that wants to hurt you
Turn you into something new
Where did my friend go?
Where did my friend go?
If I had a best friend
If I could keep only one
It would be you
If I could keep only one
If I could keep only one
It would be you
It would be you
It would be you
