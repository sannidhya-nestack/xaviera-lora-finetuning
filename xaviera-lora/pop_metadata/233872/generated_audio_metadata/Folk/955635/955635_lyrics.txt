Oh, here we come
I wanted you, you wanted me, it was a perfect fit
I called you up, you called me out, we got right down to it
Feels so good to have a lover that amazes me
You put me in a trance
Now you're all I see
The way I, way I want you is the way I, way I need you
Our love is something, something unbelievable
The way I, way I want you is the way I, way I need you
Our love is something, something unbelievable
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You look so good I got it bad
My royal princess
You're what I thought I'd never had
Nothing comes between us
And I'll be damned if I end up on the other side
And I'll be damned if I don't have you in my life
The way I, way I want you is the way I, way I need you
Our love is something, something unbelievable
The way I, way I want you is the way I, way I need you
Our love is something, something unbelievable
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
No one can do what you do
I want to lose all control lost
In the here and the now
Don't wake me
The way, the way I want you is the way, the way I need you, our love
Is something, something unbelievable
The way, the way I want you is the way, the way I need you, our love
Is something, something unbelievable
It's the way, the way I want you
It's the way, the way I want
