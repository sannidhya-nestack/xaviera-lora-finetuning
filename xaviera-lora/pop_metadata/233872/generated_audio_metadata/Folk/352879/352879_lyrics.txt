There's the shoes of a fisherman at his door
Working morning to night'til he can't take no more
He's born to fish just like every man in St. Anne
A father, a husband, and worker, all in this free man
So watch for the man of the sea as he heads in shore
Home for a bit and gone again just like the day before
So watch for the shoes of this man at his door
Or the work shoes of a man at his door
In the early morning
Look off to the east
Where the sun touches the sea
And you can only smell salt in the air
You'll see them boats bobbing in the water
A harsh life cold wet more than their share
They bring home the fish this is the bacon
There's the shoes of a fisherman at his door
Working morning to night'til he can't take no more
He's born to fish just like every man in St. Anne
A father, a husband, and worker, all in this free man
So watch for the man of the sea as he heads in shore
Home for a bit and gone again just like the day before
So watch for the shoes of this man at his door
Or the work shoes of a man at his door
And around Middlehead where the Celtic lodge rises
You'll see him in his boat
Riding joy calling pie duck
Just another weathered man
And husband doing his work
All I knew that to me he was my mother's father
Cutting her finger to the bone just another perk
I'll defeat his very large family day after day
There's the shoes of a fisherman at his door
Workin' morning to night'til he can't take no more
He's born a fish just like every man in St. Ann
A father, a husband, and worker, all in this free man
So watch for the man of the sea as he heads in shore
Home for a bit and gone again just like the day before
So watch for the shoes of this man at his door
Or the work shoes of a man at his door
There was no gold or money in the fish
Just an end to a means to feed a hungry mouse
No pension, no gold watch, no retiring from this boat
He carried on from his father, who carried on from his
The job is yours always
And your sons take the nets
And traps and traditions
There's the shoes of a fisherman at his door
Working morning to night'til he can't take no more
He's born to fish just like every man in St. Anne
A father, a husband, and worker all in this free man
So watch for the man of the sea as he heads in shore
Home for a bit and gone again just like the day before
So watch for the shoes of this man at his door
Or the work shoes of a man at his door
Often I go back now that I'm a man
And I close my eyes the fishermen are all gone
Not much gold in fish but in the still of the early day
If you listen you can hear them still fighting
The nets and the great sea
Talking in a dialect only native to Cape Breton
Including the man who is my mother's father
There's the shoes of a fisherman at his door
Working morning to night'til he can't take no more
He's born to fish just like every man
Every man an insane man
