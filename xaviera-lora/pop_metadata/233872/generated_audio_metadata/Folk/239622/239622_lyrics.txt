When we were young to run and laugh
Would have been child's play
When I was little I just ran to hide
To survive another day
Do you know why?
We'll always be brothers in arms
A special bond like no one else
ed in both love and harm
We're just brothers in arms
We're just brothers in arms
I didn't mean to leave you behind
It was a complex time for me
I had to break free of my demons
To live a life without fear
And I knew in time
That you'd know why
We'll always be brothers in arms
A special bond like no one else
ing both love and harm
We're just brothers in arms
And now you are a man
And I see you have done well
A husband and a person of principle
Even better,'cause you lived through hell
Our words never said, our thoughts the same
And we will both always know why, why
We'll always be brothers in arms
A special bond like no one else
ed in both love and harm
We're just brothers in arms
We're just brothers in arms
Just want you to know that I'm okay
I still tend to survive
Sometimes looking over a shoulder
But the child in me is still alive
Playing with my little boy
Having a late childhood
And no one can deny
Of all people you'd know why
Of all people you'd know why
We'll always be brothers in arms
Special bond like no one else
Fortune, both love and harm
We're just brothers in arms
We'll always be brothers in arms
Special bond like no one else
Fortune, both love and harm
We're just brothers in arms
We're just brothers in arms
We're just brothers in arms
