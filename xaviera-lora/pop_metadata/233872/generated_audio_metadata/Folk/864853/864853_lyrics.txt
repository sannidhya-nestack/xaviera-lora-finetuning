Sunday morning, sitting and believing in the church
Disappearing with echoes of the sun
No one sees you leaving the shadows of your hurt
Confessions of stick martyr on your palms
And in the airy shelter at the bottom of the garden
You keep your summer smile'til winter's done
And if what's gone before comes unthinkably around once more
Prepare a beacon for the dreamers and the drunks
When the darkness comes
When the darkness comes
When the darkness comes
Seeing your reflection hold out handfuls of yourself
Each single piece and broken never whole
Teased apart by ghosts laying in wait behind pretence
White wraiths preying in the cold
And in the air a shelter at the bottom of the garden
You keep your summer smile till winter's done
And if what's gone before comes unthinkably around once more
Prepare a beacon for the dreamers and the drunks
When the darkness comes
When the darkness comes
When the darkness comes
But here, now, stare out into the light and see the shadows
Only sunlight's daughters waiting for the clouds to break
And here, now, become a part with eyes ablaze when darkness comes again
When darkness comes again
Reach across the chasm without fear that you'll collapse
Feel the cruel time falling past
Let the abyss become a crack in turn
A fracture that is healing
Break convent silence with a laugh
And in the air raid shelter at the bottom of the garden
You keep your summer smile till winter's done
And if what's gone before comes unthinkably around once more
Prepare a beacon for the dreamers and the drunks
When the darkness comes
When the darkness comes
When the darkness comes
When the darkness comes
