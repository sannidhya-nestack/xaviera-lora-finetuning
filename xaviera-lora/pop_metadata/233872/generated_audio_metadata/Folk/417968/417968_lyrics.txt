I'm a river flowing beside you
I'm a voice in your dreams
Water like honey shimmering golden
Much more than I've seen
I am an ember
Vaguely burning
A fragment of love long ago
If you kindle my spirit
Then I will warm you
You can feel your heart start to glow
But you worry about the demon of darkness
The starling beast in the night
But with my release you will find peace
Healing your wounds and mine
And I am a painter with prism and palette
Sleeping inside your soul
Honor the purpose, cherish the wisdom
And I will make you whole
And I am a meadow, a blazing crimson
Come, come and rest with me here
Bathe in the beauty
Breathe in the fragrance
And you will conquer your fear
I'm a river flowing beside you
