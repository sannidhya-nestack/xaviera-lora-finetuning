Oh Cape Cod girls don't use no combs
Eave away, haul away (hey, yo)
Combs their hair with the codfish bones
And we're bound away for Australia
And it's eaver up me bully bully boys
Eave away
Haul away
Eave her up and don't you make a noise
And we're bound away for Australia
Them Cape Cod ships ain't got no sails
Eave away
All the way!
We're blown off in the northeast gales
And we're bound away for Australia
And it's give'er up, me bully bully boys
Give away
All away!
Oh, heave her up and don't you make a noise
And we're bound away for Australia
Those Cape Cod kids ain't got no sleds
Ah, heave away!
All away!
They slide on down in codfish heads!
I found the way for Australia
And it's give'er up me bully bully boys
Give away!
All the way
Oh, heave her up and don't you make a noise
And we're bound away for Australia
Them Cape Cod shoes ain't got no soles
Heave away, all the way
It all burnt off from walking on coals
And we're bound away for Australia
And it's heave-a-rump me bully bully boys
Heave away, haul away
Oh, heave-a-rump and don't you make a noise
And we're bound away for Australia
Those Cape Cod cats ain't got no tails
Heave away

And we're bound away for Australia
And it's give her up me bully bully boys
Give away
Halloway
Oh, heave her up and don't you make a noise
And we're bound away for Australia

Heave away, Halloway
We're caught bound just as straight as she goes
And we're bound away for Australia
And it's heave her up me bully bully boys
Heave away all away
Oh heave her up and don't you make a noise
And we're bound away for Australia
