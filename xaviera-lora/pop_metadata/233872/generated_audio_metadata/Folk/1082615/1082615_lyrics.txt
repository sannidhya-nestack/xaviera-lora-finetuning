We was touring Ireland, got lost in the fog
It was me and Belle Johnson, we three-legged dog
Round the fens and the dales till we finally came to
The blessed roadside saying "Gingy Chaloo"
Down the cobblestone lane we ran thirsty as ghosts
Happened on wee pub name a Courses and Toasts
The red barman he called out, "Lads, what'll it be?"
Well, then Guinness for Bill and Glenly bit for me
And the folk at the back table all sang
Hey, hey, hey, doo-doo-dee-dee-dah-dee-dee-ah-ay
Be a stranger and a man
Hold up a day, have a cup with your new pals
But know if you do
You'll not out drink the women of Jinji Jadoo
Bill and me sat a corner till the care left our brow
Tell Moira good lass said, "Come sing with us now"
Then they found my sad baritone fit tried and true
While my three-legged bill gave out
And the folks at the back table all sang
Hey, hey, hey, doo-doo-dee-dee-dah-dee-dee-yah, yeah
Be a stranger and hold up a day
Have a cup with your new pals, but know if you do
You'll not out-drink the women of Jinji Charu
After three lively routs, me and Bill got so bold
As to throw down the gauntlet, then my tale I told
I was known back in Boston as Hollow Leg Paul
And I miss you, wink challenge, come one and come all
And they answered, the challenge came one and came all
There was Ravenhaired and Maggie, and Steely-Eyed Sean
The tall twins from Ulster, Sinead and Siobhan
Said Moira, "Dear Angel, I'm thinking it's no"
But the Yank wants the contest, so let it be so
So they set out the glasses and the red barman poured
And the last thing I saw for my chin hit the floor
Was me three-legged Bill cryin' (woo-woo-woo)
And the sweet-smilin' women of Gingy Drew
And the folk at the back table all singin' on and on
Hey, do-do-dee-dee-da-dee-dee-ah, yeah
Be a stranger and a neighbor
Hold up a day
Have a cup with your new highs
But know if you do
You'll not outrank the women of Jinji Jialu
You'll not outrank the women of Jinji Jialu
No you will never
Out-treat those women
Of gingeroo
They're a strong breed of women
Of Gingy Drew
