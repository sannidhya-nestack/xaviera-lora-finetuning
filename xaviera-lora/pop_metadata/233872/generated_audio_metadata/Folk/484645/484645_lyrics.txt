I've been in this place before
An island on a distant shore
The sea looks pretty in a brilliant green
Something's turning inside me
When you found me here I was so afraid
To unlock the gate and let you in
And I will be afraid no more
But if I open up this door
You're gonna have to let me know
Say that you're not gonna run away
There's nothing in this life that we can't face
I can't go on feeling this way
If you leave me hanging on too long
Looking for a signal, praying for a sign
You'd still be here in the morning light
Came to me as a vision pure
Like water rising up from the desert floor
So if I open up this door
You're gonna have to let me know
Say that you're not gonna run away
There's nothing in this life that we can't face
I can't go on feeling this way
If you leave me hanging on too long
I've been all alone for too long
All I have left in me is this song
Sing
That you're not gonna run away
There's nothing in this life that we can't face
I can't go on feeling this way
If you leave me hanging on to the law
Say that you're not gonna run away
There's nothing in this life that we can't face
Let me carry you away
To our island on the distant shore
Stay, stay, stay
