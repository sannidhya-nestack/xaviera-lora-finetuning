Your voice is on the line
It sends a shiver down my spine
Hearts on my sleeve
Find I can't speak
Your voice is on the side
I've seen the light
How would I decide
If you could be mine
What I've done is wrong
So you tell me when I've lost my mind
Heart's on my sleeve
When you're near me find I can't speak
Running out of time, running out of time
Running out of time to love me
Running out of time, running out of time to get me
Running out of time, running out of time to love me
Running out of time, running out of time to have me
Heart is on the line, can you hear?
Your heart is on the line
Can you hear hearts on my sleeve
When you're near me find I can't speak
When you're here with me
