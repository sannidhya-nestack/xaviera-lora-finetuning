I went to the mountains looking for a home
Running from a lady and feeling all alone
I set up by the campfire and I watched them evening stars
And couldn't shake this feeling that I wouldn't get too far
And I never knew what tomorrow would bring
I never brought myself to say
That I never knew if I would see her face again
Alive or dead, not knowing either way
So I went to the city running from myself
And running from the fire within that'll burn a man to death
I holed up in a bar there and I drowned myself in rum
And waited for my passing day but the day ot to come
And I never knew what tomorrow would bring
I never brought myself to say
That I never knew if I would see her face again
Alive or dead not knowing either way
I went to the islands and I sailed into the sun
I tried to wash those tears away with island girls and fun
But all those nights of dancing only seemed to hurt my feet
And bruised me somewhere deep inside until my heart was beat
And I never knew what tomorrow would bring
I never brought myself to sin
That I never knew if I would see her face again
Alive or dead, now I know it ain't either way
Well, I guess I'll head for home today
I've got nothing left to lose
I ran off all of my island girls
And drank up all of my booze
Perhaps I'll see the mountain reflected in her eyes
And on that day, well, I'll find my peace
And I'll lay me down to die
I'll lay me down to die
I'll lay me down to die
