Smile sweet child, everything is what you believe
Play sweet child, don't worry about what you see
To be true
Trust the light in you
As it shines to pull you through
Love sweet child
For love is the grandest way to give sweet child
And what you desire will come your way
Oh, this is true, call on the light in you
You were born to be just like you are
'Cause it's a beautiful world
And it's a beautiful day
You are a beautiful soul
And this feeling never goes away
Grow sweet child
Your life is a journey of joy
Blossom sweet child
And remember who you are
You are truth
Follow the light in you
And it will always guide you
Back home to you
'Cause it's a beautiful world
And it's a beautiful day
You are a beautiful soul
And this feeling never goes away
Cause it's a beautiful world and it's a beautiful day
You are a beautiful soul and this feeling never goes away
Don't let anyone tell you any different
