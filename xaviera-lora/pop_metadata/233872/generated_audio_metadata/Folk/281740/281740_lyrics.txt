Daddy was a runner in a souped-up Edsel Ford
With a trunk full of white lightning and loaded forty-four
He always started late, left the police at the gate
When he delivered moonshine door-to-door
I learned the trade just like my daddy did
On the back roads of the county when I was a kid
No time for biscuits, beans and country ham
We ate Vienna sausage from a can
Door to door, door to door
The welcome mat was always out
From the good folks on our route
When we delivered moonshine door to door
He would always tell me don't buy whiskey at the store
It's only half as good and it costs a whole lot more
Our still house got the axe
Cause we didn't pay no tax
Best to get your moonshine door to door
Daddy didn't worry about the law
The sheriff was his brother and the mayor was his pa
They always took good care of dad and me
Especially when they got their liquor free
Door to door, door to door
The welcome that was always out
From the good folks on our route
When we delivered moonshine door to door
Now when I'm watching NASCAR and they're flying around the track
Think about my daddy, oh how it takes me back
He said stay low in the turns
That's the way the rubber burns
It's just like calling moonshine door to door
Door to door, door to door
The welcome mat was always out
From the good folks on our route
When we delivered moonshine door to door
Door to door, door to door
The welcome mat was always out
From the good folks on our route
We delivered moonshine door to door
