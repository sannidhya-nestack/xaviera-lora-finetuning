Under nature's glow
Men trek through the endless snow
Possessed by the ecstasy of gold
Hundreds of miles from home
Into the deep unknown
Troubled by the ecstasy of gold
Shifting sands, shifting paths
Precious metal in a cold, cold hand
Alaska, it was a rush
Shifting sands, shifting paths
Precious metal in a rich man's hands
Alaska, it was a rush
Was there always so much?
The dreams and the tales told
Your mysteries now unfold
Haunting the ecstasy of gold
Brave men they come and they go
Uptown and Everest oh
Raptured by the ecstasy of gold
Futes in sand, sipped on pine
Pitches metal in a cold, cold hand
Alaska, it was a rush
Shifting sand, shifting paths
Precious metal in a rich man's hands
Alaska, was it worth so much
Child dying in a dirty bed
Suicide in a mother's head
Repulsed by the ecstasy of gold
While rich men are overfed
Never stopping to count the dead
Fueled by the ecstasy of gold
Shifting sand, shifting paths
Purchased metal in a cold, cold hand
Alaska, it was a rush
Shifting sand, shifting paths
Purchased metal in a rich man's hand
Alaska, was there worth so much?
'Cause all that glitters is not gold
all that glitters is not gold
all that glitters is not gold
all that glitters is not gold
