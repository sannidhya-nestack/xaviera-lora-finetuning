It's just my lucky day
As we go hand in hand
Just like Valentine's Day
Running on the hot beach of sand
Flowers, promises and chocolate
And cards too, to say I love you
And all the years since we met
Your roses have been red and the violets blue
every day our love is new
And every day that love has stayed true
And it's just my lucky day
As we go hand in hand
Just like Valentine's Day
Runnin' on the hot beach sand
Same Valentine's should be every day
To respect and love in every way
And love is a gift when it is true
So at the end of the day
I'm glad it's just me and you
And I know you're happy too
It's just my lucky day
So we go hand in hand
It's just like Valentine's Day
Running on the hot beach sand
Oh, real love is the one that's been challenged
By what life can't hand out
It won't break
But it's designed to bend
Two lives as one
Without a doubt
Destined to love'til the last days
And right to when the heart beats and
It's just my lucky day
As we go hand in hand
Just like Valentine's Day
Runnin' on the hot beach sand
It's just my lucky day
As we go hand in hand
Just like Valentine's Day
Runnin' on the hot beach sand
It's just my lucky day
Just like Valentine's Day
I guess it's my lucky day
Just like Valentine's Day
