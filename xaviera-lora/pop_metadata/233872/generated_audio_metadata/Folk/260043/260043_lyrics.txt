Kind friends and companions, come join me in rhyme
Come lift up your voices in chorus with mine
Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain
For we may and might never
I'll meet here again
Here's a health to the company
And one to my last
Let us drink and be merry
All out of one glass
Let us drink and be merry
All grief to refrain
For we may and might never
All meet here again
Here's a health to the sweet lass that I love so well
Her style and her beauty sure none can excel
There's a smile upon her countenance as she sits on my knee
Sure there's no one in this wide world as happy as we
Here's a health to the company and one to my loss
Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass
Let us drink and be merry all grief to refrain
For we may and might never all meet here again
Our ship lines at harbor, she's ready to dock
I hope she's safe landed without any shock
If there we should meet again by land or by sea
I will always remember your kindness to me
Here's a health to the company and one to my lass
Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass
Let us drink and be merry all grief to refrain
For we may and might never all meet here again
Here's a health to the company and one to my lass
Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass
Let us drink and be merry all brief to refrain
For we may and might never all meet here again
