Well I've been wondering where I might be a few years from now
And I've been thinking about the mountains and the sea
I've been hoping that you'll be around
And I've been thinking I finally had my fill of these seven day weeks
And I got plans for a long string of Saturdays down at the beach
And oh I can see it
Baby our future looks bright
And every morning that summer bears a shine
And each night can be a Saturday night
Each night can be a Saturday night
And I've been wondering where we might go if we just cut and ran
See I've been thinking about leaving it all is that something that you'd understand
And I've been thinking I'm tired of living my life by some other man's watch
When there's a better life there for the taking
Like a boat waiting down at the docks, yeah
Oh, I can see it
Baby, our future looks bright
Every morning that sun of air's shining
Each night can be a Saturday night
Each night can be a Saturday night
And I've been wondering what you might say
If I should ask you to dance
To the edges of this earth with me
Is that something that you'd understand?
And if I should whisper my secret designs
In your ear while you are sleeping tonight
I don't know if you'll still be here in the morning
But I'm hoping you'll mask
'Cause oh I can see it
And there our future looks bright
Never a morning that sun bears shining
Each night can be a Saturday night
Each night can be a Saturday night
Oh, I can see it
There our future looks bright
Never a morning that's sunless shining
Each night can be a Saturday night
Each night can be a Saturday night
Saturday night
