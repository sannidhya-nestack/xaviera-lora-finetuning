Singin' a bell-bottom trousers, coats of navy blue
Let him climb the Reagan like his daddy used to do
Now once there was a waitress in the Prince G e Hotel
Her mistress was a lady and her master was a swell
And he knew she was a simple girl and a lady from the farm
And so they watched her carefully to keep her from all harm
We're singing up hell bottom trousers, coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging like his daddy used to do
Well, the 42nd Fusiliers came marching into town
And with them came a complement of rapists of renown
Well, they busted every virgin's head that came within their spell
But they never made the waitress from the Prince G e Hotel
We're singing a bell-bottomed trousers, coats in navy blue
Let it climb the Reagan like his daddy used to do
Next came a company, the Prince of Wales, who soars
They crammed into the whorehouses and packed along the bars
Now many a maiden mistress and wife before them fell
But they never made the waitress from the Prince G e Hotel
We're singing a bell bottom trousers, coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging like his daddy used to do
One day came a sailor lad, an ordinary bloke
A-bulging at the trousers with the heart of solid oak
At sea without a woman for seven years or more
There wasn't any need to ask what he was looking for
We're singing a bell-bottom trousers, coats of navy blue
Let him climb the reggae like his daddy used to do
Well, he asked her for a candlestick to light his way to bed
He asked her for a pillow to rest his weary head
Then speaking very gently as if he meant no harm
He asked her if she'd come to bed just so to keep him warm
Well, she lifted up the blanket and a moment there did lie
He was on her, he was in her, in the twinkling of an eye
He was out again and in again and plowing up a storm
The only word she said to him
Keepin' warm, we're singin' a bell-bottom trousers
Coat's a navy blue, let him climb the ringin' like his daddy used to do
Early in the morning that sailor lad arose
Said here's a two pound note my dear for damage I have caused
Now if you have a daughter you bounce her on your knee
And if you have a son you send that bastard out to sea
We're singing about bottom trousers, coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rig and like his daddy used to do
Now she sits upon the dock, a baby on her knee
She's waiting for those sailing ships a coming home from sea
She's waiting for those Jolly Tars in Navy uniforms
And all she wants to do, my boys, is keep the Navy warm
We're singing a bell-bottom trowel, there's coats of Navy blue
Let him climb the rig and like his daddy used to do
We're singing a bell-bottom trowel
Trousers, coats and navy blue
Let him climb the rig like his daddy used to do
