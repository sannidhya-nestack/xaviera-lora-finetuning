Look ahead, look astern, check the weather and the lead
Little high, little low, and so still a wee
I see a wreck to windward and a lofty ship to lee
The sailing down along the coast of high Barbary
Now over the waves a frigate's mast was spied
Blow high, blow low, and so sail are we
And though we were outgunned, you know these pirates never hide
We're sailing down along the coast of High Bond
Now, are you a pirate or a man of war, they cried?
Blow high, blow low, and so sail are we
We are not a pirate, but a man of war, replied
Sailing down along the coast of high Barbary
Well then square up your mainsail and heave your vessel too
Blow high, blow low
And so sail away
For we have got some letters
To be carried home by ye
A sailor now along the coast
To high Bondary
Well we'll heave up our taut sail
And bring our wrestle too
Low high blow low
And so sail away
But only in some harbour and along the side of ye
We're sailing down along the coast of High Barbary
Well, for broadside, for broadside we fought along the main
The high below, and so sail are we
Until the pirate shot the last frigate's mast away
He's sailing out along the coast of High Barbarie
Well for quarters, for quarters, the frigate's master cried
Blow high, blow low, and so sail are we
Well the only quarters given was to leave them in the tide
He's sailing out along the coast of High Barbarie
With cutlass and gun, no we fought for our street
Low high, low low, and so sailed we
The ship it was their coffin, and the grave it was the sea
But sailing down along the coast of high Bollary
Now it was a grim sight, and it grieved us awful sore
Go high, go low, and so sail are we
To see the sailors drowning as they try to swim for shore
The sailing down along the coast of high Monterey
A look ahead, look astern, check the weather and the leaf
Low high, low low, and so the sailor we
I see a wreck to windward and a lofty ship to lee
Sailing down along the coast of High Bowery
