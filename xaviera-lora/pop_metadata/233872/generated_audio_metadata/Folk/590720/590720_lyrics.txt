I let my heart when I reached the crossroads
And I took the other way
I wasn't so sure and deep down I was afraid
But I've come to learn there's more than just one way
And all the other roads I didn't take
Like dreams of a long sleep but I'm awake
And all the other promises I didn't make
I walked away, some say I escaped
What if, what if
What if the road is all we'll ever have
What if, what if
If we arrive, then what is left for us
We'll never know
I saw the map, I did the math, I planned my course
For each and every step
No matter what I did I always came across a choice
This set of doors
And all the other places I didn't see
Had over planned that we remained to see
And all the other people I didn't meet
Will they realize, be what they want to be?
What if, what if
What if the road is all we'll ever have?
What if, what if
If we arrive then what is left for us
We'll never know
What if, what if, what if the road is all we'll ever have
What if, what if, if we arrive then what is left for us
We'll never know
