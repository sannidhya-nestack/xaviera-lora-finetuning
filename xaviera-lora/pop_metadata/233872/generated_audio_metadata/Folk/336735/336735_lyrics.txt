We started out drinking round the old kitchen table
We're maritime boys, we're strong and we're able
We're cases twenty-four and a quart is a blessing
early hours of the morning, the songs we'll be singing
Don't park the car far from the bar, she said
Don't park the car far from the bar
Don't park the car far from the bar, she said
Don't park the car far from the bar
As an Adam was full, Troy was pissed as a newt
Uncle Mark staggered in, still missing a boot
Me brother John sat down before he fell over
And we sang to the bar mate, sent another round over
Don't park the car far from the bar, she said
Don't park the car far from the bar
Don't park the car far from the bar, she said
Don't park the car far from the bar
Where's Nellie Malone out drinking alone
She's singing along to a maritime song
I'd bought her a drink and she said me awake
If she plays her cards right I just might take her home
Don't park the car far from the bar she said
Don't park the car far from the bar
Don't park the car far from the bar she said
Don't park the car far from the bar
We ended up drinking round the old kitchen table
We're maritime boys, we're strong and we're able
We're cases twenty-four and a quart is a blessing
three hours of the morning, the songs we'll be singing
Don't park the car far from the bar, she said
Don't park the car far from the bar
But don't park the car far from the bar, she said
Don't park the car far from the bar
But don't park the car far from the bar she said
Don't park the car far from the bar
But don't park the car far from the bar she said
Don't park the car far from the bar
