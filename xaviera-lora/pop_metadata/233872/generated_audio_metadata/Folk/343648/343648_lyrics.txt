Love still carries on
Farther from today
Takes his place inside
Where we want to stay
All she knows
Is all she'll be
What she'll do
It grows so free
Makes its way on down
Far into the sea
Back to where we go
Where we want to be
Fall to flow
And feel the flow
Caring Christ
Create
Pearl
Her way still carries on closer to the day
Makes this home inside where we want to stay
All she knows is all she'll be
What she'll do
It grows so free
Takes its name alone
What it wants to do
Free forevermore
Green into the blue fall
To flow and feel the full
Hearing cries create a rule
