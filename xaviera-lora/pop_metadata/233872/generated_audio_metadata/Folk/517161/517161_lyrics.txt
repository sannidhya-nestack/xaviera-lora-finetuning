I went to see her on a rainy day
The kind of rain that's hard and long
With some skepticism and a vague hope
To unlock sweet mysteries unknown
Up the steps into her office
Use the toilet then we started
Down the swirling inner stairway
Pick one door and here we go
What do you see here? Are you young or old?
Can you paint a picture of this room?
Is there anybody else around you?
Is there someone here?
You might know
There's a child in patent leather
Is she lonely? Where's her mother?
Is she scared? She looks unhappy
I'm not ready but here we go
I can see a hillside with a rocky landscape
There's a house on a prairie where I raised a family
On a boat, ocean breezes as they wash over me
I can see a lady on her deathbed
Now it's over, I feel unmoved
An impartial witness, uninvolved
But I was really too afraid to feel at all
So no answers, no crystal ball
Then she asked me who my guide is
Oh my God, it's Ed Asner
And he tells me take it easy
And I'm laughing, mmm yeah
And we're looking on the inside
Is there someone who could be me?
It's a goddess wearing blue jeans
She'll protect me
She'll be kind to me
Always love me
And she'll always be there, oh, oh
Always be there
Always be there
Always be there
Always be there
Always be there
Always be there
