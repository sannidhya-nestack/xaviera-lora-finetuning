What is not what it seems
What were we led to believe or see
Bones through boxes and lies on the side
Look away now while the pockets are lined
So you preach democracy
But you practice hypocrisy in the light
In place of faith, is this your crusade?
So who are you to decide what's right?
And who gave you the permission to fight?
Lay down your, lay down your guns
Lay down your, lay down your guns
Silence is in the air
Fallen souls are everywhere I can breathe
Stench of war is choking me
Lay down your, lay down your guns
Lay down your, lay down your gun
Can you see the children die
Hearts bleed but our hands are tired of seeing
Bones to boxes and lives on the side
Go away now while the clock is aligned and move
Who are you to decide what's right?
Lay down your, lay down your guns
Lay down your, lay down your guns
Lay down your, lay down your guns
Lay down your, lay down your guns
Religion, religion drive us down
So let's
Your guns, your guns
