My baby love that floor play
That what she always say
My baby love that floor play
That what she always say
We play it on my big brass bed
Floor play until we're breathless and red
We play our floor, play off the floor
It keeps us coming back for more
We play our floor, play off the floor
It keeps us coming back for more
When there ain't no big brass bed
I use my head, do something else instead
Floor play only with someone you love
One can be below and the other above
Floor play only with someone you love
One can be below and the other
The other, the other one above
What that floor play you may ask
It's better than any household task
What that floor play you still may ask
Oh better than any wine filled flask
Bounce your baby on your knee
Then give her a little tickle for me
Bounce your baby off your knee
Then give her a little kiss for me
Squeeze your baby on your lap
Then give her a good old love tap
Squeeze your baby on your lap
Now give her a good little lovin'
Little lovin' little lovin' slap
Mama loved floor play, yes she do
Mama loved it more than her chickens do
Papa loved floor play, yes he do
Papa loved it more than his bubbly brew
Everybody loved that floor play
That's how we got here today
Everybody loved that floor play
That's how we got to be here
Be here, be here, be here
Be here today
My dog love floor play, my cat do too
But not with each other, this ain't no zoo
Is it more fun with a wig or mask?
If you're wondering, huh, then you're too young to ask
I'm her sugar daddy and she's my sugar baby
Maybe, just maybe they beef floor play
Beef floor play, beef floor play today
If there ain't no big grass bed
Then never you mind use a cot instead
If there ain't no cot at all
Then never you mind you can use the hall
If the hall's behind locked doors
Then never you mind there's always
Always, always, always, always the floors
When we're old and lying in our beds
We can still floor play in our heads
If we're sick or alone instead
We can still floor play in our head
We all need floor play instead of meds
So keep on, keep on
Floor playing, floor playing
Floor playing, floor playing
Till we're dead
