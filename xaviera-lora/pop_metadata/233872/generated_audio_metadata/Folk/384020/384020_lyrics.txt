O'er the airy, half-a-wallow tree
A soldier boy and his terror leave
Though long ago and so far away
The willow keeps a-weeping for their love today
Don't grieve terribly, terribly
I'll return to you someday
Wait for me by the willow tree
Cried her love as he rode away
For it is said, once the willow tree
Grew so tall and as proud as can be
Sorrowing for a man
The willow lovely willow bent down to weep
Don't grieve, dearly, dearly
I'll return to you someday
Wait for me by the willow tree
Cried her love as he rode away
Now in that field so long ago
Where he fell off his mortal blow
On where his wounds made crimson the snow
Grew a willow, tiny willow
"Don't grieve, terribly, terribly, I'll return to you someday"
"Wait for me by the willow tree," cried a lover as he rode away
