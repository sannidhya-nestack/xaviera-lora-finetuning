It's Sunday evening, the day has been fun
The food has been eaten, the dishes are done
The night is beginning and a new year's begun
And this is a silly song
So pick up a cat and put on a hat
Don't flower and bloom on the wall
Throw out the turkey and we'll chew the fat
And sing this silly song
It's fun to be silly if silly's the game
et who you are, et your own name
Let's laugh a hyena and monkey proclaim
And sing this silly song
So pick up a cat and put on a hat
Don't flower and bloom on the wall
Throw out the turkey and we'll chew the fat
And sing this silly song
Let's go to the city, now don't be afraid
Let's play all day long on the farm
Let's laugh and dance in the passing parade
You know cows don't have any arms
We'll walk in the sky and fly in a boat
We'll drive to the moon in a car
We'll sail a bicycle without any coat
But we better not go very far
So pick up a cat and put on a hat
Don't flower and bloom on the wall
Throw out the turkey and we'll chew the fat and sing this silly song
Yes throw out the turkey and we'll chew the fat and sing this silly song
