So all my friends decide to leave
No one else can seem to say
Exactly what I feel
So past the signs I lead away
From eyes I never meant to stray
It's not the same
You're better off leaving (I'm gonna let it all out)
You're better off dreaming (I'm gonna let it all out)
Gonna stop believing (I'm gonna let it all out)
Now you ask to share my space
I never felt so second place
Before you
And cast away my fears of you
All I ever said was true
If only for a while
You're better off leaving (I'm gonna let it all out)
You're better off dreaming (I'm gonna let it all out)
You wanna stop believing (I'm gonna let it all out)
