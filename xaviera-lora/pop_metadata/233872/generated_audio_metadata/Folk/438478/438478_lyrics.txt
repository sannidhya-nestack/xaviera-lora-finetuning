When I'm with you
There's no need to be blue
You lift me up when I am down
There's no grace other than rain
No sorrow or pain
No more running around
When I'm with you I feel strong
Nothing else can go wrong you'll see
It's you and me
So let's spend the day
Like two kids at play
And we'll pretend that we just met
So I can again
Make you love me my friend
I don't want you to et
When I'm with you I feel strong
Nothing else can go wrong you'll see
It's you and me
La la la, la la, la la la
La la la, la la, la la la
La la la, la la, la la la
La la la, la la la
When I'm with you I feel strong
Nothing else can go wrong, you'll see
It's you and me
La la la la la la
La la la
La la la la la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la, la
