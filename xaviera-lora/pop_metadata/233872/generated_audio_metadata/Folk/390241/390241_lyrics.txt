And I won
Let the wind carry me
Let the wind carry me
Let the wind carry me
Cool on the sea
Not weak and alone
None will take me home
When the shadow breaks and when the sun descends
Just carry my blues away
Carry me
When I'm through, take me down
Lost, make me found
Let me fall and arise
In the sea, heal my eyes
When I've lost the wind
Is when the sun decides
To carry my errors away
Let the wind carry me home
I'm weak and alone
None will take me home
Carry my errors away
Carry me, carry me, carry me
Let the wind carry me
Let the wind carry me
Let the wind carry me
