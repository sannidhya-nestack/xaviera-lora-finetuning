I have a friend with a big beard and Jesus hair
The best thing he ever told me was
Please be willing to be unsure and die
I tried, I tried but it's hard
A long time ago he asked me a question
Have you ever been to Crane?
I've been there once since then
She cried, she cried'cause it hurts
We ate lunch in a dark and drafty café
Trivial pursuit cards on the tables
I settled with the cards
Wishing more sunlight came through the windows
Pretending she was not dying
Okay, I admit it
I'm not sure of anything
I'm still fumbling
Still chasing something
I don't know exists
And there's still a corner on the highway called Crane
I've been there once too often
And I, I tried, I tried, but it's hard
And she, she cried, she cried,'cause it hurts
