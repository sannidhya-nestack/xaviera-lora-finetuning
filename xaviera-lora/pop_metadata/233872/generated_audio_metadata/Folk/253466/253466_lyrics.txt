The thick fog rolls
Through Point Pleasant Park
The bleak grey color
Pastel against the darkness
But years ago I remember many sunny moments
Where love swirled through the summer leaves
But the fog sweeps those memories back out to sea
And hides the secrets and buries them in the dark
And here I am, still looking for the good old days
Got to wonder if good things will ever come my way
And when I close my eyes, you're still there by my side
No wonder why I'm still looking for those kinda days
Oh, still looking for some good old days
Yeah, looking, looking for the good old days
As I button up my coat
For the dreariness of the day
I feel the lines of a light
That crease my face
I've got more yesterdays in me than tomorrows
But I can still see her in that dress of pretty lace
But like my future the memory quickly fades
To go back and stay I beg steal or borrow
Poor Burrow
But sadly here I am
Still looking for the good old days
I remember back then
When secrets were easy to hide
And when I close my eyes, you're still there by my side
No wonder why I'm still looking for those kinda days
Oh, still looking for some good old days
Yeah, yeah, looking, looking for the good old days
And here I am still looking for the good old days
Got to wonder if good things will ever come my way
When I close my eyes you're still there by my side
No wonder why I'm still looking for those kind of days
Ooh, still looking, looking for some good old days
Yeah, looking, looking, looking for the good old days
Oh, looking, looking, looking for the good old days
Yeah, yeah, looking for the good old days
