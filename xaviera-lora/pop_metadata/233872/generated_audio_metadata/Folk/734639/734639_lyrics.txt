Purple clouds, daffodils in the field where we lay
Purple hues in the hills with the wind we could fly away
And all the silver lining that's stretched across the sea
The blue and silver colors combined with the beauty of
Bubble clouds, daffodils in the field where we lay
Bubble hues in the hills with the wind we could fly away
Swells of laughter bound across the valley
With a smile I know so well
White plum blossoms swept up by the breeze
That carries its sweet smell
Turn your face to the sunset and your hands to the sky
Celebrate this day of one with the fireflies dancing into the night
Bubble clouds, daffodils in the field where we lay
Bubble hues in the hills with the wind
We could fly away
Heaven's colors pour out
And it's all meant for you
Turning grey into oil
You're the essence of fiery red
Meaning beloved blue
Purple clouds, star-fed hills in the field where we lay
Purple hues in the hills with the wind we could fly away
Purple clouds, daffodils in the field where we lay
