Restless, restless feeling
Been pushing me around
Got my hands ripped and bound
And if I leave
Then it won't be long
Till the silence
Tears in my heart
I am not that strong
Hold you, hold you dear
It's all I ever want to do
Our bodies split one and two
And it only, only goes to show that what hurts you
Bruises my soul, it cuts deep and slow
And it seems so long and dreary
And the time just moves so slow
No here is not where you want to be
It's getting old
You're numb to the cold
You can't shake the cold
Can't shake the cold
Lady, oh lovely lady
This is only temporary
I know the present looks so scary
And hanging on to each other is what we got
And what we have is beautiful for each other we cover
It is what we got and what we have is beautiful
For each other we cover
It is what we got and what we have is beautiful
For each other we cover
