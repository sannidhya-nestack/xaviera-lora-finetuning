As you greet this day
Thinking life is so unkind
How can you find your way
If you always look behind
You even know the questions
To the answers that you seek
When to run, when to fight
When to turn the other cheek
Oh Romeo, oh Juliet
Don't lose yourself in a lifetime of regret
So speak your truth, sing your song
'Cause you're a long time gone
This thing isn't over yet
we all have a choice
Have you spoken of your love?
Let them hear your voice
We all have chains behind us
But we can find the keys
So leave that love behind us
And get up off your knees
Romeo or Juliet
Don't lose yourself in a lifetime of regret
So speak your truth, sing your song
you're a long time gone
And never judge another
Till you've been walking in his shoes
Make an enemy of your brother
And in the end you lose
Oh Romeo, oh Juliet
Don't lose yourself in a lifetime of regrets
So speak your truth, sing your song
you're a long time gone
A long time gone
A long time gone
