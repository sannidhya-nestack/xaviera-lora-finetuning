I've been taking my sweet time, been dragging my feet too much on my mind
When I get to thinking it out, gonna feel like a brand new day
Totally listless, got no aim for mark shooting
Stray bullets at the words that hide in the dark
When I get to figuring them out
It's gonna feel like a brand new day
Until that moment of enlightenment
Just don't have much to say
Get up every morning, get my foot to work
Useless information got me clogged up and worse when
I get to clearing it out, gonna feel like a brand new day
Tired of weeping, got no tears left on my face
I'm tired of moaning, I'll take happy in its place
It doesn't matter anyway,'cause it's a brand new day
Here comes that moment of enlightenment
Guess I'm gonna pick up my guitar and play
