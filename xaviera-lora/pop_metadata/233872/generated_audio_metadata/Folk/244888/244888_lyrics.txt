Kings Island, Kings Island, Kings Island, Kings Island
We left England far behind
With a charter from King James in hand
Crossed the Atlantic and set foot upon
A wild and uncharted land
The ships that we sailed and all our supplies
Came from the London Company
With Christopher Newport
At the helm we started the Jamestown Colony (Jamestown, Jamestown, Jamestown, Jamestown)
Some said that the odds were against us
It had never been done before
Would Jamestown succeed
Or was it doomed to fail
Would we perish or would we endure
The gentlemen and the commoners
Numbered one hundred and five
After seven months in the wilderness
Only thirty-two settlers survived
Jamestown, Jamestown
For the new world we were bound
Jamestown, Jamestown
It was there that we put our roots down
We overcame sickness and fought off disease
For those who died, we did more
In 1608 we all would have died
Had it not been for Indian corn
Just as the year was ending
A fire spread through the town
Flames engulfed our houses
Jamestown nearly burned to the ground
Jamestown, Jamestown
For the new world we were bound
Jamestown, Jamestown
Is there that we put our roots down
Jamestown, Jamestown
Jamestown, Jamestown
Relief and supplies finally arrived in the spring of 1610
Jamestown began to prosper and it all started when
We harvested fields of tobacco to send back to the motherland
After five years we were in the clear
Jamestown was able to stand
Jamestown, Jamestown
For the new world we were bound
Jamestown, Jamestown
Was there that we put our roots
Jamestown, Jamestown, Jamestown
