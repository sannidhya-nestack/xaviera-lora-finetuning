Every time she feels the sky
She tries to see if she can fly
Far into the azure dreams
Rising above
And if she ever has a care
She'll bring it back to anywhere
That makes it ever pure
And breathes contentment within
Every time she makes her play
She never wonders what to say
About the things she's longing for
Brilliantly known
And if she ever has a doubt
She never ever lets it out
For something sure as peaceful grace
Makes her face shine
All the while in her smile
Peaceful realms of heavenly bliss
All the day poignant grace
Safely rests back into this
Every time she feels the sky
She tries to see if she can fly
Far into the ash of dreams rising above
And if she ever has a doubt
She never ever lets it out
For something true as peaceful grace
Makes her face shine
