So, pass the mug around me boys, pass around again
Don't be stingy, don't be shy, we're drinking to a friend (drink)
Pass the mug around me boys, shout and raise'em high
It's always greater to have said better him than I
Now Johnny was a fine young lad, we loved him like our own
Said, "Be careful, son, where you go, how far away you roam"
The ladies, they will treat you, boy, with pretty words they lie
He strayed one night, never seen again
Better him than I, so pass the mug around me, boys, pass around again
Don't be stingy, don't be shy, we're drinkin' to a friend (drink!)
Pass the mug around, leave boys a shout and raise'em high
It's always greater to upset better him than I
Now Davey was a strapping lad, brave and strong of will
Said, "Be watchful, boy, who you know the nicest ones can kill"
The crimps are all so crafty, so mind your mug of rye
He didn't heed and was shipped away (shipped away?)
Better him than I
So pass the mug around me boys
Pass it'round again
Don't be stingy, don't be shy
We're drinking to a friend (drink)
Pass the mug around me boys
Shout and raise'em high
It's always greater to ascend
Better him than I
Oh, now indeed he was a sailor true and a smile for all his mates
Said, "Be steady, man, where you sail, he always tempted the baits"
He took a dare to face the gale, he stopped with a laugh and a sigh
Surrendered over to Davy Jones
Davy Jones!
That's bad
Oh, I'm nuts
Better him than I, so
Pass the mug around me boys, pass it round again
Don't be stingy, don't be shy, we're drinking to a friend (drink)
Pass the mug around me boys, shout and raise'em high
It's always greater to ascend, better him than I
Gina's plans, they had all worked out
Maggie's schemes were played
And Kristy's traps had all been sprung
They hadn't been afraid
The boys were gone, the girls were free to slip out on the slide
With map and ship they sailed away
Laughing better him than I
So pass the mug around me boys
Pass around again
Don't be stingy, don't be shy
We're drinking to a friend, great!
Pass the mug around me boys
Shout and raise'em high
It's always greater to have said
Better him than I
So pass the mug around me boys
Pass around again
Don't be stingy, don't be shy
We're drinkin' to a friend
Drink
Pass the mug around me boys
Shout and raise'em high
It's always greater to have said
Better him, better him, better him than I
