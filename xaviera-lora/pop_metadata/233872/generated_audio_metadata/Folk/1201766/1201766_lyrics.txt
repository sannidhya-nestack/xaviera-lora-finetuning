I pulled down the trap door in the hallway
I climbed the stairs to my childhood secret hiding place
I finally opened that big old trunk, it was always in my way
I'd been putting it off, but I knew this was the day
Right there on top was my daddy's American flag
Folded as they always do on the day past
It came home in a coffin draped with the flag
How he died no one ever asked
There's my daddy's baseball glove and his old 45
Black and white in his plane in some far off war
And mom and pop at the beach, love of a magic kind
And photos of grandmas and grandpas I've never known
Those old photographs bring tears to my eyes
And this tattoo on my arm
I'll wear it with pride
It's our family tree
No skeletons to hide
It's our family history
That's been bona fide
Underneath my daddy's flag
Was a Civil War uniform
Blood stained, tattered and torn
It was great, great grandpa's a dear John letter
Oh I can feel the pain
And a broken purple heart, we know whose it was
Now sit back, let yourself drift back
Dig deep in that trunk
Let yourself go back in time
And maybe you could see
Daddy in his plane
And grandpa in that uniform with the blood stains
Those old photographs
Bring tears to my eyes
And this tattoo on my arm
I wear it with pride
It's our family tree
No skeletons to hide
It's our family history
That's been bonafide
It was Grandpa
That got the Dear John letter
Like that broken purple heart
He was no better
No no no
