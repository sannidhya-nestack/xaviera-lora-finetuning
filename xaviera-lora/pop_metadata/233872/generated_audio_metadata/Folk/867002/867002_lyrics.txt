We watch the full moon rising on a midsummer night
The warmth of sunlight fading on a midsummer night
When the air is still now, hear the seabirds cry in flight
Hand in hand by the bracelet we stand, charmed with delight
Saw the moon in balance and tune on a midsummer night
Skylarks are boldly singing on a midsummer night
And the tea is ours to chase them into fields of emerald light
Hand in hand we walk the land
In the midst of moonlight
Charms set in circle complete on a midsummer night
Blue magic still and deep on a midsummer night
There's a full moon rising and the sun sets out of sight
Let Venus rise, shine in our eyes
In the midsummer moonlight
On a midsummer night
