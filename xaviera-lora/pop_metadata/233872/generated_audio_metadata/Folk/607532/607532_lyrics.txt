You took me to a bench in Central Park
And sat me down while you twiddled your thumbs and looked around
Started to stutter and say, "You've got something to tell"
You don't even have to open your mouth'cause
I think I get it, get it
The way you've been acting funny these days
And I think I know it, know it
So on the tip of your tongue you're gonna say
You love me
And that's alright, I love you too
As we walk under the stars tonight
I think I feel a flutter in my chest to end
All of a sudden, all of a sudden
Words are hard to say
But I don't even have to try to explain
I think you know it, know it
The way I've been acting funny these days
And I think you know it, know it
So on the tip of my tongue I'm gonna say
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
