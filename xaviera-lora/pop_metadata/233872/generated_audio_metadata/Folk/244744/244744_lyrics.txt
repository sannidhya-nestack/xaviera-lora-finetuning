I am yours in the night
My heart is in your hand
With you there I have no fright
And with your love I know I came today
Because you are the one, my only hope
You are the sun that helps me cope
You bring the love like a dart from way above
To touch my heart from way above
To touch my heart
In the past I have strayed
As a child you weren't there
I do regret games I played
But now I see you've been fair today because
You are the one, my only hope
You are the sun that helps me cope
Bring the love like a dart from way above to touch my heart
From way above to touch my heart
I am yours in the night, my heart is in your hand
With you there I have no fright, with your love I know I can today
Because you are the one, my only hope
You are the sun that helps me cope
Bring the love like a dart from way above
To touch my heart from way above
To touch my heart, to touch my heart
You are the one, you are the one
You are the one
