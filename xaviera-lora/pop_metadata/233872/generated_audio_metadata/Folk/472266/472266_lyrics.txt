I can be your spaceman
Or I can be your Peter Pan
I can be your hero
Or I can be your zero
I can be whatever you want me to be
I can sit at home and watch TV
I can ride, I can fly, I can fill the throne
I can be your touchstone, yeah
I can be your touchstone
I can be your carpet
And I can get your car fixed
I can be your rented mule
Cyron or diesel fuel
I can be your cowboy
But I don't really want to
I can be an artist
And I can write you love songs
I can be whatever you want me to be
I can sit alone and watch TV
I can ride, I can fly, I can fill the throne
I can be your touchstone, yeah
I can be your touchstone
I can be a devil in the bed no doubt
Rate my performance from the inside out
No one can tell me that I won't be there
I can be your touchstone
I can be your touchstone
I can be your touchstone
I can be your touchstone
I can be your touchstone
I can be your lean on
And I can be the reason
I can be your target
You just need to want it
I can be the sequel
But you can play my equal
I can write you poetry
You just need to want me
I can be whatever you want me to be
I can sit at home and watch TV
I can ride, I can fly, I can fill the throne
I can be your touchstone, yeah
I can be your touchstone
I can be your touchstone
I can be your touchstone
