Lord, I miss your sunshine
I'm so tired of all this rain
The clouds returning to darken my skies
Blocking out all my happiness inside
Nowhere to shelter with my sorrows burning deep
I'm losing my balance yet how do I stay on my feet?
Lord I need
Your sunshine
To wipe out this depression
That I've set into my mind
Lord, I need your sunshine
Like a flower needs the rain
Lord, I need
Your sunshine, I'm so folded up with pain
Lord, I need your sunshine
Like a flower needs the rain
Lord, I need your sunshine
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired
In the end of all this rain
Lord, the path I have followed
Has left me nowhere to turn
Lord you promised if I follow thee
My suffering will surely end
Take my life and make it brand new
Turn my dark skies from grey to blue
My heart is filled with so much emptiness
Lord warm up my days and dry up my loneliness
Lord I need your sunshine like a flower needs the rain
Lord I need your sunshine
I'm so folded up with pain Lord I need your sunshine
Like a flower needs the rain
Your sunshine
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, oh
Lord, I need you in my life, yeah
I wanna shine, I wanna be your light, yeah
I don't want all this pain in my life
Take away these dark clouds from
Covering me, blocking me, oh lord
Take it away, away, away
Oh, my sky's all so gray
I need you in my life, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm calling on you Lord, you know my heart is my soul
Right here right now, cause I'm so tired of all this rain
