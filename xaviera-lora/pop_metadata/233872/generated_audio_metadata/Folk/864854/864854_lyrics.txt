Sitting in a horse trough with half a bottle of wine
It's okay, it was read Spanish, remember?
Same as the last time, all the things we've done
Balancing up feather teaspoons hanging from our faces
Swallowing laughter'til exploding
Scattering outrages, oh
The things we've done
And we are doing alright
Making each other smile at
We are doing alright
Sharing the best of our lives
The best time of our lives
Drinking scrumpy for the first time
Smiles fly to and fro like swifts
To consummate our freedom
And then share it as a gift, oh
The things we've done
Lampooning Yorkshire cereal crop
Navigating baby bells
To the rocket man's refrain
Again, again abandoning ourselves
Oh, the things we've done
And we are doing alright
Making each other smile and
We are doing alright
Sharing the best of our lives
The best time of our lives
Tinned apricots from cupboards rediscovered in the fridge
While proposing drunken baking with gin crumbling our wits
Oh, the things we've done
Counting clothes pegs, hiding in a tangle on the chin
As laser driven kittens weave in and out of everything, oh
The things we've done
And we are doing alright
Making each other smile
We are doing alright
Sharing the best of our lives and
We are doing alright
Making each other smile and
We are doing alright
Sharing the best of our lives
The best time of our lives (best time of our lives)
Having the time of our lives (having the time of our lives)
And we're doing alright
We're doing alright
