Every long journey is made of small steps
Is made of the courage, the feeling you get
When you know it is waiting, been waiting for you
The journey's the only thing you want to do
We cannot know what you go through or see through your eyes
But we will surround you, the pride undisguised
In any direction, whatever you view
You're taking our love there with you
In every long journey, what drives you to go
It's half what you know and half what you don't
The secret's been waiting, your heart's got the key
The secret's the only thing you want to see
And we cannot know what you go through or see through your eyes
But we will surround you, the pride undisguised
In any direction, whatever you view
You're taking our love there with you
And every long journey begins with a dream
A spirit with courage to make it all real
The dream has been calling, been calling to you
The dream is the only thing you want to do
And we cannot know what you go through or see through your eyes
But we will surround you, the pride undisguised
In any direction, whatever you view
You're taking our love there with you
And we cannot know what you'll go through or see through your eyes
But we will surround you, the pride undisguised
In any direction, whatever you view
You're taking our love, taking our love
Taking our love there with you
