We went one day to see the sea
We walked along the water's edge to be
Alone together hand in hand
With the sand under our feet
So sweet
Today you said you would be my love
For me you would rise above the rest
And you picked a rock from off the shore
A keepsake to remember what we came for
But that was many years ago
In a different life
Now I never know
Now you act as though I am not here
As you down another glass of beer
There's a space beside me in our bed
There's a space inside me in my head
But you'll be different one day
I'll get my own way one day
Maybe I'll be famous one day when I'm dead
We went one day to see the priest
On knees we knelt, a sigh to feast
But all of those who stood and watched
As your hand outstretched, you said, "I do, do you?"
Thought that was many years ago
In another life
Now I never know
Now you act as though I am not here
As you down another glass of beer
There's a space beside me and out there
There's a space inside me in my head
But you'll be different one day
I'll get my own way one day
Maybe I'll be famous one day when I'm dead
When I'm dead
One day when I'm dead
And all the time I kept on wishing, wishing
And all the time that we were missing
All alone, all alone
Thought that was many years ago
In a different life
Now I never know
Now you act as though I am not here
As you down another glass of beer
There's a space beside me in our bed
There's a space inside me in my head
But you'll be different one day
I know I'll get my own way one day
Maybe I'll be famous one day when I'm dead
One day when I'm dead
One day when I'm dead
