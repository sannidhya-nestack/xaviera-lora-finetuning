Shoulder up your gun, whistle up your dog
Shoulder up your gun, whistle up your dog
Off to the woods fold to catch a groundhog
Oh groundhog
Run here Sally with a ten foot pole
Run here Sally with a ten foot pole
Twist that whistle pig out of his hole
Oh groundhog
Here comes Sal with a snicker and a grin
Here comes Sal with a snicker and a grin
Groundhog gravy all over her chin
Oh groundhog
I dug down but I didn't dig deep
I dug down but I didn't dig deep
There lay the whistle pig fast asleep
Oh groundhog
Now the meat's in the cupboard and butter's in the churn
Meat's in the cupboard and butter's in the churn
If that ain't groundhog I'll be darned
Oh groundhog
Well, you eat the meat, save the hide
You eat the meat, save the hide
Make the best shoestring ever was tied
Oh, groundhog, look at them fellas, they're about to fall
Look at them fellas, they're about to fall
They eat'til the britches won't button at all
Oh, groundhog
A little piece of cornbread layin' on a shelf
A little piece of cornbread layin' on shelf
If you want anymore you can sing it yourself
Oh groundhog, oh groundhog, oh groundhog
