There's a bear in the bed, he's not hunting
Bear, were you sad, you'll leave something
So you can come back and stay for a little while
Longer maybe next we can hold on to one stop time
You can't come back if you don't leave you say
That part of you stays with me every day
You can't come back if you don't leave, you see
Yet you touch my life in every way
You touch my life in every way
Using magical hands
Hold moments still
Twixed burning delirium
And abandons brink
Where doubts sting like paper cuts
And brighter lights may dim
We'll uncomplicate the memory
Recall a future that we glimpsed
You can't come back if you don't leave, you say
That part of you stays with me every day
You can't come back if you don't leave you say
Yet you touch my life in every way
You touch my life in every way
There is a bear in the bed
He's not sleeping
There where you said
It's for keeping
There is a bear in the bed
The bear in the bed, he is not hunting
