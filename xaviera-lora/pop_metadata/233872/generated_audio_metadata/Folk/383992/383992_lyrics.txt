There I go, looking for the rainbow
There I go, reaching for the stars
There I go, hoping for your love dear
For tomorrow will be a brand new day
I've been told, dreaming is for fools dear
I've been told, dreaming is for kids
But I keep hoping for your love, dear
For tomorrow will be a bright new day
But a realist wouldn't look for the rainbow
Or the golden promise it holds
He would feel that the stars were far from reach
And hoping just in vain
But I know loving brings the rainbow and the stars shining in the sky
So I'll keep hoping for your love, dear, for tomorrow will be a bright new day
Now a realist wouldn't look for the rainbow or the golden promise it holds
He would feel that the stars were far from reach and hoping just in vain
But I know
And brings the rainbow and the stars shining in the sky
So I'll keep hoping for your love, dear
For tomorrow will be a bright new day
For tomorrow will be a bright new day
