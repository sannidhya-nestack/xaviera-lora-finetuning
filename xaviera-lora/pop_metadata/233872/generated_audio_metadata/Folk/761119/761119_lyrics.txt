You hold the key
To the secrets holding me
I'm lost in the sound
Of silence twisting round and round me
I'm falling down in your broken world
An empty place, always smeared and blurred
Climbing up but never reaching up
I'm falling down, falling down
You're still in my mind
Tugging at my life
These dreams are dusty paths
And nothing's gonna last for long
I'm falling down in your broken world
An empty place always feared and blurred
Climbing up but never reaching up
I'm falling down
I'm falling down
I'm falling down in your broken world
An empty place always smeared and blurred
Climbing up but never reaching up
I'm falling down
I'm falling down
I'm falling down
I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling
