Drinkin' down at Harold's house, just another case of beer
Another bottle of whiskey on, but never have fear
You always have more beer
Singin' ay diddle ay day, ay diddle ay do
Ay diddle diddle ay day, ay diddle diddle ay do
Ay diddle diddle ay do
Blastin' from the truck stereo, Steve-O-Roll's Exit-O
Hammer down for the mill speed mile, it's time to let'er go
It's time to let'er go
Singin' ay-deedle-aye-day, ay-deedle-aye-doe
Ay-deedle-aye-day, ay-deedle-deedle-aye-doe
Ay-deedle-deedle-aye-doe
Susan was the queen of hearts on the dairy farm
She drove the tractor she hauled for hay straight into the barn
Straight into the barn
Singing ay diddle diddle diddle diddle ay
Ay diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle
Ay diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle
Ay diddle diddle diddle diddle diddled
Ay diddle diddle diddle diddled
We're drinking down at Danny's place
Just a little farther down the road
Don't know how we made it there
Someone must drove
Someone must drove
Singing hi diddle diddle I do
Hi diddle diddle I do
Hi diddle diddle I do
Hi diddle diddle I do
Hi diddle diddle I do
Drinkin' back at Harold's house
Just another case of beer
Another bottle of whiskey on
But never have a beer
We always have more beer
Singin'
Ay-dee-da-lay-day
Ay-dee-dee-da-lay-do
Ay-dee-dee-da-lay-day
Ay-dee-dee-dee-da-lay-do
Ay diddle diddle I do
Singing ay diddle I day
Ay diddle I do
Ay diddle I day
Ay diddle diddle I do
Ay diddle diddle I do
