We're scraped to off the floor
Not wanted anymore
Nothing's gone to plan
We're all etful
She's lazy with her look
Her otten books
She's riddled with mistakes
She can't et
I'm hiding
Not fighting
Pale rider, no chasing, racing, facing
I'm hiding, not fighting
Pale rider, no chasing, no embracing
Disappearing girl, interfering world
The demons have gone home
They won't remember a sun that doesn't shine
Cheap cigarettes and wine, her paint is all but gone
Who's standing there?
I'm hurting, not fighting
El Rider, no chasing, race or facing
I'm hiding, not fighting
El Rider, no chasing, no embracing
Never again, nothing remains
No turning back, no time to explain
That's why I say no never again
And that's why I say no never again
And that's why I say, why I say, why I say, why I say
No never again
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm hiding
Not fighting
Hell rider
No chasing, racing, facing
I'm hiding
Not fighting
Hell rider
No chasing, no embracing
There's no embracing, no
She can't et, she can't et, no
They won't remember, but I know
Who's standing there, who's standing there
Scraped her off the floor, not wanted anymore
