You get up to start your day
You come of age an enlightened way
You get around, do it casually
Don't make a sound, summons the cavalry
When you lay down to rest your head
You wander far from where you ain't been
Miss it at its only make believe
Fall to your knees for relief
Climb free from the center of your mind
There lies a revelation
Don't make sense of our tangled past
It's revolving, stars and cast
It all happens at the same time
This life, that life, yours and mine
Turn inside, the work is never done
Open outside, the fun has just begun
Miss it at its only make believe
Fall to your knees, fall relieved
Release your mind, give rise to your soul
It's a revelation
It's a revelation
It's a revelation, release your mind
Give rise to your soul
It's a revelation, release your mind
Give rise to your soul
It's a revelation, release your mind
Give rise to your soul
It's a revelation, release your mind
Give rise to your soul
