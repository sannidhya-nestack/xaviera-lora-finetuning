I wanna climb that mountain
See the river below
Climb that mountain
Hike as high as I can go
Summit fever in my blood
A madman in my shoes
Trudging through the brison mud
To panoramic views
I wanna climb that mountain, see the river below
Climb that mountain, hike as high as I can go
Hand me down my hiking pole, we'll watch the stars tonight
Heal the heart and feed the soul, away from city light
I wanna climb that mountain, see the river below
Climb that mountain, hike as high as I can go
Bathing in a spirit beam, turning round and round
Living John Muir's noble dream to walk on holy ground
I wanna climb that mountain
See the river below
Climb that mountain
High, kiss high as I can go
Wanna climb that mountain
See the river below
Climb that mountain
High, kiss high as I can go
