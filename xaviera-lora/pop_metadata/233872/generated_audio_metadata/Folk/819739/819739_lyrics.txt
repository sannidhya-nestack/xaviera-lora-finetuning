I know you'll try another way to fly
That's mine, that's mine
And then you'll see the real me
That's fine, that's fine
I just want to sculpture you
Mold you to windstone
I just want to sculpture you
Look at you when I'm alone
I know you'll see
Another way to be
That's true, that's true
Could I say
I found the way
For you, for you
I just want to sculpture you
Mold you in stone
I just want to sculpture you
Look at you when I'm alone
I know you'll try
Another way to fly
That's mine, that's mine
And then you'll see
The real me, that's fine, that's fine
I just want to sculpture you
Mold you with stone
I just want to sculpture you
Look at you when I'm alone
And I just want to sculpture you
Mold you to windstone
And I just want to sculpture you
Look at you when I'm alone
