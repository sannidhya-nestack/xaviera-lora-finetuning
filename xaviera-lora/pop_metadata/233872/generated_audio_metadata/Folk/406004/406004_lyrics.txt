Behind the shadows
Behind our walls
Nestled inside
Our frantic world
A still small voice of wisdom calls
Reaching out his hand
Sharing comfort as a teardrop falls
Our light in the dark when storm clouds fall
A still small voice of wisdom calls
Reaching out his hand
When heaven whispers
It's worth to me
It's my saving line that sounds so sweet
When heaven tells me
The way that I should go
I know I'm heading
The safest way home
My strength when I'm lonely and feeling small
Renewing hope with each day that dawns
A still small voice of wisdom
Reaching out his hand
When heaven whispers its words to me
It's my saving rhyme that sounds so sweet
When heaven tells me the way that I should go
I know I'm heading the safest way home
When heaven tells me the way that I should go
I know I'm heading the safest way home
I'm going home, hey yeah
I'm going home
