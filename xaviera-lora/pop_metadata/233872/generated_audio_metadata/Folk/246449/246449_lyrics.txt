Summer comes and summer goes away
People say time flies
Well don't they have a lot to say
I don't care, I don't care, honest
I've done my best, I've done my best
Let it go, let it go they'll say
People want no wrong and don't it scare me so
I don't know, I don't know
Harmless
At a glance
At a glance
I hear you say
Just take a chance
Just take a breath
Well okay
Where every smile, where every smile just disappears
If you're an angel by my side
It's time to take me out of here
Take me home, take me home
Oh, promise
Nothing less, nothing less
