I am a tree of the tallest you can see for miles
And the town's been good to me
Every year the robins come to lay their eggs
Knowing I'll be here
To keep them safe, so pretty the way they sing for me
Oh, and I say that life's been good to me
Oh, life's been good to me so far
So far, so far, oh
I'm aesthetically pleasing to look upon
And I give a good shelter from the sun
Straight and solid, no I do not need
Home to many a creature I cradle in my lease
Oh I do feel, yeah I do see
That life's been good to me
Oh life's been good to me
So far, so far
Oh, you're so far
Oh, builders and miners, don't cut me down
Business and croppers, don't cut me down
Two hundred years I've been growing, don't cut me now
Refuse a dollar, keep me around, don't cut me down
Keep me around, don't cut me down, no
Keep me around, don't cut me down, don't cut me down
I am a tree, oh the tallest you can see
For miles, and the town's been good to me
