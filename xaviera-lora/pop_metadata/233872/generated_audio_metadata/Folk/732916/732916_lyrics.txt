Waiting for the end of days or the turning of times
At this point it's safe to say either way you would be fine
Desperation made to last not meant for this design
Don't think it's too much to ask I want only what was mine
What was mine?
Too early to fall apart
Too late to hold it together
Keep hearing hang in there
But I can't hold on forever
My mind keeps me running
But I'm cold to the touch
Battle keeps on raging
Feels like I've lost so much
So much time
All my time
My time
All my time
Slipping through my fingers
Want to go back to the way things were my time
Oh my time
All within my agony
I begin to fear the end of me
Holding tight to each breath I breathe
Stuck waiting for the cure I seek
Hard things they come to pass
You never get more than you can take
Try to find a way to outlast
The cruel games of the face
Oh my time, my time, oh my time
Slipping through my fingers
Want to go back to the way things were my time
Oh my time
Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My time
Oh my time, my time
All my time
Slipping through my fingers
Want to go back to the way things were
Slipping through my fingers
Want to go back to the way things were
My time
All my time
My time, oh my time
Slipping through my fingers
Want to go back to the way things were
Slipping through my fingers
Want to go back to the way things were my time
Oh my time
Losing all my time
