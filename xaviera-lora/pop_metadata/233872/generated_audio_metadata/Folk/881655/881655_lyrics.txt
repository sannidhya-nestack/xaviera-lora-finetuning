Feel the autumn memory fade
A dress abandoned where it lay
The golden reds and copper shades
Become a carpet thread they're made
Build the fire up, close the door shuts, old man winter comes
Build the fire up, close the door shuts, old man winter comes
The road's suspended, holding breath
Dormant trees sleep nonetheless
Their intricate stark silhouettes
Cause shadows with a dark harass
Build the fog
Close the door shut, old man winter comes
Build the fire up, close the door shut, old man winter comes
The hare who wears a winter coat
In motion celebrates the snow
Sitting tight to box its bow
In stillness of nocturnal cold
Build the fire up, close the door shut
Old man winter comes
Build the fire up, close the door shut
Old man winter comes
Now winter's at the window
See Jack's fingers scratch
As still wind brings the first snow
Laying light on Thailand thatch
Though the brooks and rivers freeze, water still flows underneath
Tears of heavy skies that bleed from hilltop springs to cisterns deep
The pulse of life for beast and men
Holding fast till winter ends
To nurture and prepare for when
Old Man Winter comes again
Build the fire up, close the door shuts, old man winter comes
Build the fire up, close the door shut
Old man winter comes (old man winter comes)
Build the fire up, close the door shut
Old man winter comes
