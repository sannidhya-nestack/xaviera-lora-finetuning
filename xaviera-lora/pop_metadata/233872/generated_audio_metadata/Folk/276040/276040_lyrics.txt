My mind's been racing, the slime's been chasing
That good old tequila again
My head's nearly bursting with all those words that were said
I don't even know when
The campfire's fading, the night with a Satan that's gonna quit coming around
this gypsy in me is settling down
The wind's been changing my days, rearranging its time, I headed for home
I'm strong and determined'cause I've been learning just how to live on my own
There's a hawk been gliding and I've been fighting to follow its path through the sky
And now this gypsy maid is saying goodbye
'Cause I've been running so long
The highway has been singing
And I can't say I've been wrong
My soul has found its wings
I've been out to the desert where the sunset splices the mountains
To the sky
Watchin' sand dunes shiftin' and my life driftin'
I thought I knew how to fly
I thought of your eyes when we both gave up tryin'
I had to get outta that town
And now this gypsy in me is settlin' down
'Cause I've been running so long
The highway has been singing
And I can't say I've been wrong, my soul
Has found its wings
I've been out to the desert where the sunset splices the mountains to the sky
Watching sand dunes shifting and my life drifting'cause I thought I knew I could fly
Thought of your eyes when we both gave up trying
I had to get out of that town
And now this gypsy in me is settling down
This gypsy in me is finally settling down
