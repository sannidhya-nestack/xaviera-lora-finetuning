There'll be no splitting hairs when evening comes
Only you and me there while the neon hums
Outside down upon the constant parade
Of those countless souls flickered lights on our shade
Who will never know
The kind of love that we share when the evening comes
And I just wonder and stare as my heartbeat drums
Like a mountain top on a whim
The wind dims round the rim of the sky
As I try to comply, I can't contain my sigh
Why let it feed at a pace all its own
As the sun sets low and you're home
I hear the keys in the door when evening comes
It's more than worth waiting for
You're returning from all those hours apart
And the harshness of day, well it blinds my sight
I'll stumble around, feel my way unto the night
Twilight fades at a pace all its own
As the sun sets low and you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You add together two hearts when evening comes
And when you total the parts it becomes the sum
That we call our love
See the constant parade of those countless souls
Shadowed shapes on our shade who will never
Twilight it fades out of place all its own
As the sun sails through and you're home
Oh, oh, oh, oh
