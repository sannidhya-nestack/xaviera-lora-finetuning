Suffer with your broken wings
Time to say goodbye again
I guess I always kind of knew
That through the shadows and the rain
Everything remained the same
We said but didn't really do
We said but didn't really do
I backed myself into a corner
Where I can't see to find my way
It seems that everything in my life
It takes forever and a day
It takes forever and a day
Just to sit here quietly
And share the silence with my love
Is all I ever wanted
But I refuse to see the signs
I guess they say that love is blind
that was never really you
No that was never really you
And I back myself into a corner
Where I can't seem to find my way
And it seems that everything in my life
It takes forever and a day
Mmm, it takes forever and a day
It takes forever and a day
Mmm, forever and a day
Takes forever and a day
Forever and a day
