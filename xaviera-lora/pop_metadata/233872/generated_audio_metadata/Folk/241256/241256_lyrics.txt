They waited for a new start in their harsh lives
So they were herded on boat, boat after boat
They thought of when their fear, their fear would end
The old and the new, the men
And their wives
A few thought this was a land of hope
But most knew there was just no choice
The first was fifteen, an Irish girl named Annie Moore
Fiery redhead wondered what was in store
And when Ellis Island is mostly alone in the night
And if you close your eyes as the fog rolls in
You'll hear all about the ghosts and whispers
Of all that passed through
Murmuring, "Oh, mercy me"
"Oh, mercy us"
"Oh, mercy me"
The ships came from all over the world
Even the poor who'd have to make their case
You can see them as they wipe the sweat from their face
As the seasick legs wobbled on to virgin land
And as emotions went from joy to fear
They knew why it's called the Island of Tears
And how they must have a wonder about a deeper grace
As they murmured and talked to themselves
And when hell is silent
It's mostly alone in the night
And if you close your eyes as the fog rolls in
You'll hear all about the ghosts and whispers
Of all that passed through
Murmuring, "Oh, mercy me"
"Oh, mercy us"
"Oh, mercy me"
For the poor it was a different once on land
Into the separate lines they were herded
For no one knows any of life's reasons
Must be the work of an invisible hand
And through the generations of
All they'd soiled
Sweating in factories and work in the soil
Started with no more than a dry piece of paper
All they got from Ellis Island
Oh, and when L .A.'s silent
It's mostly alone in the night
And if you close your eyes
And the fog rolls in
You'll hear all about the ghostly whispers
Of all that passed through
Murmuring, "Oh, mercy me"
Or "mercy us"
Oh, mercy me
Mercy us
Oh, mercy me
