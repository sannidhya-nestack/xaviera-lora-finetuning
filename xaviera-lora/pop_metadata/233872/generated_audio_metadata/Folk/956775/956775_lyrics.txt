So you're back to square one
Going around the bend
Pull down a peg or two
In need of a friend
What tomorrow will bring
It's unknown that's for sure
It could bring you more trouble
It could bring you the cure
But most of all
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Though you've gone to the dogs
Set off on the wrong foot
And pulled out all the stops
And stumbled out of luck
You gotta put it all behind you
You gotta lay it down to rest
Don't let sorrow bind you
Don't try to second guess
But most of all
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
But most of all, don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down, down, down, down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
