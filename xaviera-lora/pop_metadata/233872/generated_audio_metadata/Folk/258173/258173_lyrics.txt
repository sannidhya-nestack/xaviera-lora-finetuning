I'd, I'd like to try, I'd like to try again
Remember when we were one before we did become
Who we've become
Let's renew a different hue
Change the blue to rose and gentle plum
Oh the pain, I've felt the pain
Raw and deep and bittersweet
To call your name, to call your name
I felt the pain
But I've hurt you too
And I may not understand
That you're isolated and without a friend
But that's not true
I'm here for you
Oh let me be here for you
The past behind us now
Let's act like we've just begun
I'm not asking for too much baby
Just your arms embracing love
And we'll fly away
I'd like to try
I'd like to try again
Remember when
We were one before we did become
Who we've become
Let's renew a different hue
Change the blue to rose and gentle plum
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'd like to try again
Oh, it's not the end
Rose and jade upon
Or we can become one again
Oh, I'll try and try
We can try again
Oh, la-la-la-la
Oh, let's try again, again
