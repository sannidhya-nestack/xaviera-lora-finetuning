Why weep ye by the tide, lady
Why weep ye by the tide
I'll wed you to my youngest son
And ye shall be his bride
And you shall be his bride lady
So calmly to be seen
But I shall let the tears downfall
For Jocko Hazelden
Now let this willful grief be done
And dry those cheeks so pale
Young Frankie's chief of Erthington
And Lord O'Langleydale
His step is first in peaceful
His sword and battle key
But I shall let the tears downfall
On Jocko Hazeldeen
A coat of gold ye shall not lack
Nor kind bind your hair
Nor metal town, nor man-aged hark
Nor pelfry fresh and fair
And you the foremost of them all
She'll ride off for his queen
But I should let the tears downfall
For a drop of hazel tea
The Kirk was decked at morning tide
The tapers glimmered fair
The priest and bridegroom wake the bride
And day and night were there
They searched for her in Bowerland
The lady was not seen
She's over the border and away
With Jack O'Hazel Dean
She's over the border and far away
With Jack O'Hazel Dean
