I left your memories in a bundle by the door
I have the strength now I don't need them anymore
I've cried all my tears now they no longer flow
And that's the way it goes
The sun finally shed light down upon my day, oh-oh
I thought my night was never ever gonna go away, oh-oh
The gentle breeze blew out the cobwebs with one blow
And that's the way it goes, yeah
And that's the way it goes when my world's just fine
And the way it goes when you're off my mind and
Well you know it's about time that I
Take this road that lies here I
Move ahead with no fear
Finally the future seems clear
And I'm not gonna let you take it back
Not gonna give you half a chance
And that's the way it goes
Sometimes I hear you whisper lies into my ear
That doesn't mean I listen just because I hear
The path you recommend
Well it's not the one I chose
And that's the way it goes
Yeah yeah yeah
Now listen dear, save your breath and store up all of your desperate pleas
Oh, and I wouldn't bother getting down upon your knees
No, no, no, your acting is as good as ever
But I'm a little tired of the show
And that's the way it goes
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
And that's the way it goes when my world's just fine
And the way it goes when you're off my mind and
Well you know it's about time that I
Take this road that lies here I
Move ahead with no fear
Finally the future seems clear
And I'm not gonna let you take it back
Not gonna give you half a chance
And that's the way it goes when my world's just fine and the way it goes when you're off my mind and
Well you know it's about time that I take this road that lies here I
Move ahead with no fear
Finally the future seems clear
And I'm not gonna let you take it back
Not gonna give you half a chance
And that's the way it goes
The way it goes
And that's the way it goes
Oh, that's the way it goes
And that's the way it goes
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
