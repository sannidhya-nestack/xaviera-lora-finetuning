South of 7th and east of Maine
It's where they go to ease the pain
It may seem harsher than your high four kicks
Their magic ain't the potion, no it's the fix
North of 7th and west of Maine
It hardly ever seems to rain
Jane is troubled that she can't decide
To wear the leather flats or the heel of cowhide
And the world still spins on its side
It don't make sense (well it don't make sense)
And it is not fair (and it is not fair)
Opportunity knocks but it don't knock
Well everywhere, yeah yeah
And it seems so cruel (and it seems so cruel)
Yeah it's like a game (it's like a game)
Yet for everyone the rules are not the same, yeah
South of 7th and east of Maine
Young boy wonders what his life will bring
Will he get out and have a chance to be
Something more than this mediocrity
North of 7th and west of Maine
Everything runs smoothly and just the same
But emptiness is growing through cookie cutter lives
Subconsciously they think they deserve the prize
And the world still spins to its demise
It don't make sense (but it don't make sense)
And it is not fair (and it is not fair)
Opportunity knocks but it don't knock
Well everywhere, yeah yeah
And it seems so cool (it seems so cool)
Yeah it's like a game (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Yet for everyone the rules are not the same
So I'll take a stance I never took before
I'll pay it forward for a few years (yeah well and)
Maybe several more'cause it
Don't make sense (well it don't make sense)
And it is not fair (and it is not fair)
Opportunity knocks but it don't knock
Well everywhere (yeah yeah)
It seems so cruel (it seems so cruel)
Yeah it's like a game (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Yet for everyone the rules are not the same (they're not the same)
South of seven
And east of may-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
North of seven
And west of may-ay-ay-ay-ay
