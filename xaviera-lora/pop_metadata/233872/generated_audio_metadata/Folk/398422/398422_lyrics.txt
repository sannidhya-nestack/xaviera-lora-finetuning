You've been lost in the darkness
A dozen rivers you've cried
Fighting hard to make progress
As your tears have dried
It's been a while since you've had a reason
To wear a smile brightly on your face
The pain has faded over many seasons
And now you're ready to embrace
That you feel fine, fine, fine, fine
You feel fine, you rise shine
You feel fine, fine, fine, fine
You feel fine, a new life line
Has led the love back in your life
When you were a girl tomorrow, the first day left your eye
You said that he was leaving after six years goodbye
It's been a while since you've had a reason
To wear a smile brightly on your face
Your pain has faded over many seasons
And now you're ready to embrace
That you feel fine, fine, fine, fine
You feel fine, your eyes shine
You feel fine, fine, fine, fine
You feel fine, a new life line
Has left the love back in your life
Reading the letter that he left you
Now means almost nothing at all
A year ago those words they floored you
But time has been your friend through the squall
And now you'll hear your call
But you feel fine, fine, fine, fine
You feel fine, you're all shine
You feel fine, fine, fine, fine
You feel fine and you're offline
You feel fine, fine, fine, fine
You feel fine, you're right shine
You feel fine, fine, fine, fine
You feel fine and you love to let her hang
And let the love back in your life
