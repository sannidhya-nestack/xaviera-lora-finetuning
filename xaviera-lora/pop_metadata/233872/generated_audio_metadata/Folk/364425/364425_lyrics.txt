It started out so innocently
An injury at work
The doctor gave him medicine
To ease his pain and hurt
Now he's addicted to drugs
Addicted to drugs
Well, he used to be a nice guy
But now his temper's short
Slapped his wife around the other day
Now he's off to court
And he's addicted to drugs
Addicted to drugs
So his wife and kids just left him
They packed and moved away
You know, he didn't mean to scare them
But now he'll pay
And he wonders how he got here
The days are such a blur
He lives from fix to fix with a stagger and a slur
Now he heads out to the drug store
He knows it's way too soon
But he needs those drugs to dull the pain
So he can make it through
Just one more day
Addicted to drugs
Addicted to drugs
He'd like to get his life back
Yes, he'd really like to quit
Maybe he'll try later
After just one more hit
