Feet on the ground
Forcing the sounds of our proximity to flight
Old enough to fear it
Young enough to try
Lost by design
Ignoring the signs of our deliberate demise
Close enough to taste it
Far enough to hide
And fall asleep
Dream of the light
this is where I belong
Right between the cracks
This is where I belong
Not the future nor the past
This is where I belong
Hard as it may be
Somewhere I can breathe
Caught in disguise
Falling over branches we have climbed
High enough to reach it
Low enough to find
And fall asleep
Dream of the life
Cause this is where I belong
Right between the cracks
This is where I belong
Not the future nor the past
This is where I belong
Hard as it may be
Somewhere I can breathe
Open the doors and run to the hillside
Follow the lights and throw yourself into the light
Open the doors and run to the hillside
Follow the lights and throw yourself into the light
Open the doors and (open the doors)
Run to the hillside
Follow the lights and
Throw yourself into
Hide open the doors and
Run to the hillside
Follow the lights and
Throw yourself into
Why?
Cause this is where I belong
Right between the cracks, this is where I belong
Not the future, nor the past, this is where I belong
Hard as it may be
Somewhere right, this is where I belong
Right between the cracks
This is where I belong
Not the future nor the past
This is where I belong
Hard as it may be
Somewhere I can breathe
