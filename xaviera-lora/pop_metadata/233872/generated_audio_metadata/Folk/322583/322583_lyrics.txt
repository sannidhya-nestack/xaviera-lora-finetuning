It's been a year since that winter day
I held her hand and kissed her face
She was so peaceful when we both whispered goodbye
And no one ever saw that big white dog she claimed to see
But I believe it was right there at her feet
She was kind
Warm and tender
Honest, faithful, true
She loved Jesus and children
Camping by the lake
Her hair was white, she had eyes of blue
Her home was her castle and grandpa was her king
She was happiest with family by her side
She was strong, my mother's mom, my grandma
And that cherry tree is blooming in her backyard now
The irises will soon emerge from the frozen ground
Smoke billows from that old wood stove
Rising to the sky
She was kind, warm and tender
Honest, faithful, true
She loved Jesus and children
And camping by the lake
Her hair was white, she had eyes of blue
Her home was her castle and grandpa was her king
And she was happiest with family by her side
She was strong, my mother's mom, my grandma
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
God I miss that woman
My grandma
