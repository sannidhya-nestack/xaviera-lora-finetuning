Ba-da-dum-dum, da-dum, da-dum, dum, da-da-dum-dum, ba-da-dum-dum
Little Miss Sunshine, you and your bright eyes
Your precious smile, dear, turns the grey
Of this dark night straight into sunlight
As you dance in the rain
Oh I, I'll stand by
I'll fight to defend you from this world's pain
I'll fight to defend you but I can't pretend to be all that you crave
And you
You take this heart and turn it into something new
And you
You take this man and turn him into something good
Ba da dum dum
Ba da dum dum
Da-da-da-dum-dum
Da-da-dum-dum
Why is it that I always want what I can't have
And I find me asking you to stay
Oh I must confuse you
But I don't wanna lose you
Don't take my sunshine away
Oh no
And you
And you, you take this heart and turn it into something new
And you, you take this man and turn him into something
You take this man and turn him into something, oh no
You take this man and turn him into something good
