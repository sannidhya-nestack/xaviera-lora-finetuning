Everyone sat on the big blue planet
Nothing turned out the way they planned
Millions of people look out of place
Alone on this rock, spinning in space
Lovers, they quarrel the whole world over
From the blue Nile to the cliffs of Dover
Doesn't really matter where the river bends
Story twists and the story ends
So sadly blue
The sky and all the oceans
Me and you
Everyone sat on the big blue planet
Nothing turned out the way they planned
Look at all the people trying to chase their dreams
They saw on the cover of a magazine
I could see a star burning out and falling
Underneath the moon when the day was dawning
Maybe it was better with our hand to hold
But all the glitters is not gold
So sadly blue
The sky and all the oceans
Me and you
So sadly blue
So sadly blue
