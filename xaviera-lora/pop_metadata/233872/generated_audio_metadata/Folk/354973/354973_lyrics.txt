Well Billy bit the salt from his lip as he crawled out from the sea
All that he left was his own poison breath with no reason to breathe
Till he met a girl who was not of this world as dark as all of his dreams
And the deeds in their name brought them much fame
But no one could have foreseen
Well Lily's mother had left with another
Left her father with no wife
So he took to the wine and he spent his time
Beating Lily to the edge of her life
When she finally got free and bled all she could bleed
She turned to Billy to say
They've taken this child and they've turned her wild
For that they all will pay
Well he cut his throat and the buttons from his coat
The corporal fell to his knees
And he arrived in the mud or it could have been blood
He suffered so beautifully
When the silence he fell at the mouth of hell
They realized what they had done
But they couldn't stop now, they didn't know how
suffering had only begun
As the night drew out, the lily lost count
There's one that came free
And all that Beckham, she only could reckon
Was the noose of the hangman's tree
So when she finally got tired
Billy wrapped her in wire
And laid her in the deep
And the oceans sung
And the screams of the gall
Rocked her gently to sleep
And I'm home
And I'm home
And I'm home
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
