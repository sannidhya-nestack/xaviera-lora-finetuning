Livin' in the time
Stayin' in my lane
Tryin' to make a dime
God, it's just insane
Livin' in the time
Holdin' back the tears
Dreadin' all the fears
I'm just livin' in the time
Tired of all the lost and lonely weeks
Fed up with the tax I pay
Spinning my head over the techno geeks
My poor red eyes it makes you just wanna pray
I'm tired I've had it, I wanna have my say
Living in the time, staying in my lane
I'm trying to make a dime
God, it's just insane
I'm just living in the time
Holding back the tears
I'm dreading all the fears
I'm just living in the time
Trying to stay on the information highway
I'm dancing all the time
Gotta be wide, let me off at the nearest blue ocean bay
Computers and life, I'm just a little tired
And I've had it, I'm mad
And I feel it in my yard, I'm living in the time
I'm staying in my lane
Oh, I'm trying to make a dime
God, it's just insane
I'm living in the time
Holding back the tears
Dreading all the fears
I'm just living in the time
Living in the time
Living in the time
I'm living in the time
I'm living in the time
I'm just living in the time
Staying in my lane
Trying to make a dime, oh God it's just insane
I'm just living in the time, yeah living in the time
