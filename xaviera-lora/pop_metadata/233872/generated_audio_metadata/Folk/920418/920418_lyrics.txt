Falling faster tears from your eyes
I don't know what to do
Circle twilight deep in the sky
My hands are tied for you
And I will wait for you tonight
Hide myself in pale moonlight
Patiently until you arrive
Leave this town
Leave this town
Snare is broken, we shall escape
Two by two we fly
I promise, baby, you are the one
To fill me with your eyes
I will wait for you tonight
Hide myself
In pale moonlight
Patiently until you arrive
Leave this town
Leave this town
Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
For you tonight
Hide myself in pale moonlight
Patiently until you arrive
Leave
Leave this town
Leave this town
We'll leave this town
