If I can't get over you, I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll take a walk on the beach
And walk'til there's no one around
And I'll lay myself down where the land meets the sea
I'll let myself dream of your hand touching mine
As the water seeps into my clothes
Smile as I'm carried away on the waves to a paradise we'll never know
And I
And you
And I will end you
If I can't get over you I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll take the car for a drive
Drive way out into the desert and roll down the windows
And turn off the lights
Let myself dream your hair on my cheek
As I cut through the night and the cold
Smile as I'm carried away on the wind to a paradise we'll never know
And I'll roll into you
And I'll roll into you
And I'll roll into you
And we'll be together and I'll have forever with you
It's a dream that I have every night
Watching you walk away and disappear in the night
If I can't get over you, I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll sit and play my guitar
I'll play'til my fingers burn
my whole body yearns just to be where you are
I'll let myself dream your voice in my ear
Like a wave crashing over the shore
Smile as I'm carried away on a dream to a paradise we'll never know
And I'll roll into you
And I'll roll into you
And I'll roll into you
And you will be together and I'll have forever with you
Yeah, we'll be together if only forever is true
