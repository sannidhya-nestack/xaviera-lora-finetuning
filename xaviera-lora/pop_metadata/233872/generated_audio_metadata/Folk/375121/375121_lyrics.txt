Oh Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
Oh Mary, don't you weep, don’t you mourn
Pharaoh’s army got drowned, did
Oh Mary, don’t you weep
If I could, I surely would
Stand on the rock where Moses stood
Pharaoh's army got drownded, oh Mary don't you weep
The Lord told Moses what to do
To lead those Hebrew children through
Pharaoh's army got drownded, oh Mary don't you weep
Oh Mary don't you weep, don't you mourn
Oh Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
Pharaoh's army got drownded
Oh Mary, don't you weep
One of these mornings it won't be long
The Lord's gonna call and I'll be gone
Pharaoh's army got drownded
Oh Mary, don't you weep
When I get to heaven gonna sing and shout
Nobody up there gonna put me out
Pharaoh's army got drowned in it
Oh Mary don't you weep
Oh Mary don't you weep don't you mourn
Oh Mary don't you weep don't you mourn
Pharaoh's army got grounded
Oh Mary don't you weep
Oh Mary don't you weep don't you mourn
Oh Mary don't you weep don't you mourn
Pharaoh's army got grounded
Oh Mary don't you weep
Oh Mary don't you weep don't you mourn
Old Mary don't you weep don't you mourn
Pharaoh's army got drowned in it
Old Mary don't you weep don't you mourn
