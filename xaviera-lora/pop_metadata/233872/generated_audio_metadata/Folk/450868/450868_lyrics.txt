I am fighting rush hour traffic from the airport in this compact rental car
And I am driving to the outskirts where the quiet woods and neighborhoods are
As I glide'neath leafy canopies something dappled happens to my mind
Trembling sense of hoping for the letting go I'm coming home to find
Coming home
And I am sold on the virtues and vices of my solo city life
And I am driven by an appetite for complications of my own device
But these tall trees and still rooms speak in tongues that I still understand
My heart edges worn down, my coarse wood rubbed by loving hands
Coming home
Coming home
Home is the place at the very center of your heart
Where you are perfectly content with nothing more than knowing you belong
A sigh of satisfaction on a balmy summer night
A deep reassurance that everything is gonna be alright
Coming home
Coming home
Coming home
I am fighting rush hour traffic from the airport in this compact rental car
And I am driving to the outskirts where the quiet woods and neighborhoods are
