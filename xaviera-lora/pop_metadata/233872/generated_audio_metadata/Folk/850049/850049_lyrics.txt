Got yourself in too deep
You've been running
Things you can't keep
There are words you can't say
But it's understood
Say them if you could
You keep going on your own
Thousand miles to go
You walk all alone
I don't love you like I should
Give it all to you if I could
There's a way to go, it's easy
There's a reason, and that's no good
You always smile when you're down
Wanna be like that, I can't help but frown
You keep going on your own
Thousand miles to go
You walk all alone
