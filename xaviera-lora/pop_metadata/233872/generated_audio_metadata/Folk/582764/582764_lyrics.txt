I put the key into the lock and open up the door
To the place where I ot what
Laid there before with every step that I take
I remember each ache
I recall what you said
It's still all in my head
Your voice ringing loud
Your heart standing proud
You don't seem to care
Still hangs in the air
Why did it have to end like this
In my sweet solitude
Whose arms around me do I miss
In my sweet solitude
If I could have just one more wish
In my sweet solitude
It's not to see, not to feel, not to need, not to be in my
Solitude
Solitude
See your shoes still on the floor
Like it was yesterday
But you won't wear them anymore now
You've gone away with every breath that I take
I remember each ache
I can smell your cologne even though I'm alone
Your voice ringing loud
Your heart standing proud
You don't seem to hear us to ring
In my ears
Why did it have to end like this
In my sweet solitude
Whose arms around me do I miss
In my sweet solitude
If I could have just one more wish
In my sweet solitude
It's not to see, not to thrill, not to need, not to be in my
Solitude, solitude, solitude
You said baby, baby, baby
I'm gonna leave you
You said baby, baby, baby
I think I'm gonna leave you
With every breath that I take I think I'm gonna leave you
You said baby, baby, baby I'm gonna leave
Why did it have to end like this
In my sweet solitude
Whose arms around me do I miss
In my sweet solitude
If I could have just one more wish
In my sweet solitude
It's not to see, not to feel, not to need, not to be in my
It's not to see, not to feel, not to need, not to be in my solitude
