Sitting in the sunshine under a tree
Waiting for my friends to come and find me
Oh yeah, I'm just taking my time
Laughing and dancing, spinning around
You're the best friend now that I've ever found
Oh yeah, I'm just taking my time
Life could be so easy, doing as we please
These days just last so long
Hoping and a dreaming
Just the greatest feeling with you
There seems no wrong
Sitting on a rainbow, feeling so fine
Hope to catch a fish on the end of my line, oh yeah
I'm just taking my time
Laying in the meadow, feeling the breeze
I don't remember days as simple as these, oh yeah
I'm just taking my time
Life could be so easy, doing as you please, these days just last so long
Hoping and a dreaming, just the greatest feeling with you, there seems no wrong
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la
Sitting in the sunshine under a tree
Waiting for my friends to come and find me, oh yeah
I'm just taking my time
Laughing and a dancing, spinning around
You're the best friend now that I've ever found, oh yeah
I'm just taking my time
Life could be so easy, doing as we please
These days just last so long
Hoping and a dreaming
Just the greatest feeling with you
There seems no wrong
I'm just taking my time
I'm just taking my time
I'm just taking my time
I'm just taking my time
