As I close my eyes
A fountain falls
A phoenix flies
To where strangers call
So put me in a suitcase
Stick a stamp on
Push me through the letterbox
Send me away
Send me away
I was running for the train
Riding on the wall
Calling on the megaphone
Tapping on your shoulder
So put me in a suitcase
Stick a stamp on
Push me through the letterbox
Send me away
We grow, we grow
No, you say it's before the sun
No, you say it's before the sun
We grow
I was walking through a rainbow
Standing on the water
Try
She run me out and sell me out
Wash me down the well
Send me away
Away
Away
Away
Away
Away
I was running for the train
Riding on the wall
Calling on the microphone
Was tapping on your shoulder, tapping on your shoulder
Was tapping on your shoulder, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tapping on your shoulder
To put me in a suitcase
Stick a stamp on
Push me through the letterbox
Send me away
So put me in a suitcase
Stick a stamp on
Push me through the letterbox
Send me away
Push me through the letterbox
Push me through the letterbox
Push me through the letterbox
Send me away
