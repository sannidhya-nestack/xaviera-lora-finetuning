Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
There are some who claim they can see
What the truth will hold through the eyes of believers
Well I say I can see it in your eyes
I would be a fool baby just to believe ya
So I try baby I try
To take what's wrong and make it right
And I pray every night
I pray you'll come and hold me tight
Because making love
Is the only thing that I cannot do without you
But naked love still makes me wanna sing
Because you make me feel the way that I do
So I try, baby I try
Well, I could say that I'm a superhero
Then all the powers in the world I would use
Yeah, I would leap tall buildings in a single bound
There is just one thing, baby, I couldn't shake you
So I try, baby, I try
But I just can't get you out of my mind
And I pray every day
But you'll come around and see it my way
Because making love is the only thing
That I cannot do without you
But making love still makes me wanna sing
Because you make me feel the way that I do
So I try
Do do do do do do do
I'm gonna give it a try
Well if you see, you see me passing by
Baby don't et to remember me
And just because the past isn't the past
You know that doesn't mean that you can't set me free
So I'll try, baby I'll try
To take what's wrong and make it right
And I'll pray every night
I'll pray you'll come and hold me
Pray you'll come and hold me
I'll pray you'll come and hold me tight
Making love is the only thing that I cannot do without you
