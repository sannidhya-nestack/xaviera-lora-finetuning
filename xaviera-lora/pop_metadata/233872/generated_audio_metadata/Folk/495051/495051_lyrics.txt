We'll see what the morning brings
If it brings anything at all
It's all about those little things
That some would say mean nothing at all
And I say, don't you cry, I'll see you again and
We'll be friends to the end and
It's been a ride, my darling, it'll munch again and
Till we meet again, my friend
Here's to you, my sweetest friend
Most days my only friend at all
Always there by my side
Always there when I fall
And say, don't you cry, I'll see you again
And we'll be friends to the end
And it's been a ride, my darling little munchkin
And'til we meet again, my friend
Not a care in the world
Your smile says it all
Those honest eyes never judging
You never ask for anything at all
And I say, don't you cry, I'll see you again
And we'll be friends to the end
And it's been a ride, my darling, it'll much again
And until we meet again, my friend
Till we meet again my friend
Till we meet again my friend
