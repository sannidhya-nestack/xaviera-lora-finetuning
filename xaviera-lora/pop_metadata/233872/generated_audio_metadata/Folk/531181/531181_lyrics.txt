I'm fighting for a noble cause
I'll take the beating, have no choice
But I'll do it all over again
et about the ones I love
I don't see no God above
I came alone, alone I will depart
Fear has got a pest on me
Uncertain of my destiny
All around my eyes was too afraid to say
So tired of this masquerade
A sinner rather burn than fade
Claims to innocence on love and me
Society don't easily accept my lack of empathy
I can't see why, I guess that's irony
True freedom is a fantasy
Entrapped in my own mystery
Just a part of the machinery
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
