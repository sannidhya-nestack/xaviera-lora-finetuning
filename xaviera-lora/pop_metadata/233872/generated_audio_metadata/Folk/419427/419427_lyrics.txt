Oh, the summer time is coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows round the blooming heather
Will you go, lassie, go
And we'll all go together
To pluck wild mountains high
All around the blooming heather
Will you go, lassie, go
I will build my love a tower
Beyond your crystal fountain
And on it I will pile
All the flowers of the mountain
Where you go, I see you
And we'll all go together
Two block wild mountains high
All around the blooming weather
Where you go, I see you go
If my true love here were gone
I would surely find another
To pluck wild mountains high
All around the blooming heather
Where you go, I see go
And we'll all go together
To pluck wild mountains high
All around the blooming river
Where you go, I see you go
Where you go, I see you go
