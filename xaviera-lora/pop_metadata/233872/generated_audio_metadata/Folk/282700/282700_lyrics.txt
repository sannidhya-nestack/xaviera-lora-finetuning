[Screaming]
Move your body to and fro
Languid in the undertow
Going where the currents go
On the road to ruin
Shoot the lights out of the way
Watch the black and white turn grey
Signpost showing us the way
On the road to ruin
Blame the young, blame the old
Blame it on the lies we're told
Burning pictures and burning books
Some gods they have all the luck
Looking from the outside in
Turns me inside out
Holy rhymes and pledges grave
That one kills and this one saves
You'll have lots of flags to wave
On the road to ruin
We've got karma by the yard
Guess who left his calling card
Stay the course and you'll go far
On the road to ruin
Blame the old, blame the young
Playing it on the songs we sung
Burning bridges and burning flags
Ashes or a body bag
Looking from the outside in
Turns me inside out
Looking from the outside in
Turns me inside out
(Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
