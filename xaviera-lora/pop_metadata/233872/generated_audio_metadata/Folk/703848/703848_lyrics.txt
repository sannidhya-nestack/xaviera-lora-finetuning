I don't know how you got here
All I know is you're here with me
I can't think of a place where I would rather be
We can stay, we can go together
We can roam just as long as I'm with you
I know I'm at home
Let this love surround us
As it pulls us in
Carry us forever
As we drift in the wind
Maybe we could find an island
We can see by the sea
Maybe we can climb a mountain
See as far as we can see
We can take
To the desert we can lay on the sand
We can catch the next breeze when we're tired of the land
Let this love surround us as it pulls us in
Carry us forever
As we drift in the wind
If we feel like climbing higher
We can make a home on Mars
Whatever we do, wherever we go
We can call it anywhere we end up ours
Let this love surround us
As it pulls us in
Carry us forever
As we drift in the wind
Let this love surround us
As it pulls us in
Carry us forever
As we drift in the wind
