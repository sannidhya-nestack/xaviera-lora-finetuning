Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind, but now I see
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far, And grace will lead me home.
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days
To sing God's praise than when we'd first begun
Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
