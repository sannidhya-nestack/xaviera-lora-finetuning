Throw the car keys on the table
Grab yourself a glass of wine
It's that seventies dream
That risque swapping scene
It'll seem so divine
Take your time and get to know us
You should find we've lots to share
Take a look around
It's a treasure trove you've found
Like ducks to water eagles there
Step inside with us
Come alive with us
Spend some time with us
And you will find that little spice
Of your life
Lose your inhibitions in the party seems alright
Then we'll sing, oh yeah we'll sing
Swinging for England and for you
Get the spark back in your marriage
Blow the cobwebs out the door
Take the Bluetooth for a talk or your dog out for a walk
Always looking out for something more
Make a splash in the Jacuzzi
Or in the dungeon with the toys
A little suburban slap
Or tickle hard to cap
A summer that's full of the joys
Step inside with us
Come alive with us
Spend some time with us
And you will find that will spice up your life
Lose your inhibitions in the party seems so right
And we'll sing, oh yeah we'll sing
Swinging for England and for you
While we'll swing, oh yeah we'll swing
The whole night through
You can find us in a magazine and swing out in London tonight
You can find us on the internet and swing around the world, that's right
Did you ever think that life had passed you by?
Others had the fun but you never got to try
Be a player on the scene and kiss that life bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, oh bye
Step inside with us, come alive with us
Spend some time with us and you will find
That we'll sing, oh yeah we'll sing
With you and me and them and us
And everyone here can sing along
For England, swinging for England
And for the Queen herself
There can't be wrong, oh no
Swinging for England
Oh yeah we'll sing, oh we'll sing, swinging for England and for you
Oh we'll swing, oh we'll swing the whole night through
