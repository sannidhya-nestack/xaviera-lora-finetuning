Snowfall, downtown
So quiet, there's no sound
It's Christmas, Christmas
On Christopher Street
My hand in your hand
Pulling me along
It's like Christmas, Christmas
On Christopher's tree
Your eyes so bright
Like lights up on that tree
This love spark so real
It's all just magic to me
It's like Christmas, Christmas
On Christopher's tree
Just like Christmas, Christmas
On Christopher's tree
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
