Blow the wind southerly, southerly, southerly
Blow the wind south o'er the bonnie blue sea
Blow the wind southerly, southerly southerly
Blow bonnie breeze, my lover, to me
They told me last night there were ships in the harbor
So I hurried down to the deep roaring sea
But my eye could not see it, wherever might be it
The bark that is bearing my lover to me
Blow the wind southerly, southerly, southerly
Blow the wind south o'er the bonnie blue sea
Blow the wind southerly, southerly, southerly
Blow, bonnie breeze, my lover, to me
The ships there were many a-blowing and bowing
And bending right o'er in the icy sea foam
Till my eye could behold it as many had told it
The great bonnie boat of my lover come home
Blow the wind southerly, southerly, southerly
Blow the wind south o'er the bonnie blue sea
Blow the wind southerly, southerly, southerly
Blow bonnie breeze, my lover, to me
My sweetheart had fared through the winter unfriendly
His ship came along in the early spring tide
Now my heartache is ended, all rifts now are mended
My lover will soon be right here by my side
Blow the wind southerly, southerly, southerly
Blow the wind south o'er the bonnie blue sea
Blow the wind southerly, southerly, southerly
Blow, bunny breeze, my lover to me
Blow, bunny breeze, my lover to me
