Mr. Kravitzky, is the cargo all stored?
Aye, Captain!
Starboard watch aloft, prepare to set sail!
Aye, Captain!
Chantey man!
Aye, sir!
Raise the anchor!
Smartly now!
All right, boyos, round the capstan!
Heave her away!
Now we are ready to head for the horn

Our boots and our clothes, boys, are all in the pawn
To me, rollicking, randy-dandy-o
Heave a pull, oh, heave away

The anchor's on board and the cable's all stored
To me, rollicking, randy-dandy-o
Ah, ah, ah

To me, roll like in Randy Dandy O!
Heave a paw, I'll heave away
Way-ay-ay, roll and hoe!
The anchor's on board and the cable's all stored up
To me, rollicking, randy-dandy-oh

To me, relic in randy dandy, oh
Heave a pull, oh, heave away

Heave a pull, oh, heave away

The anchor's on board and the cable's all stored
To me, relic in randy dandy, oh
He lay it! (Oh, no)
