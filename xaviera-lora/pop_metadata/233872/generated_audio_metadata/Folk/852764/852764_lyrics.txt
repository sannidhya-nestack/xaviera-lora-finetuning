You, you're in my daydreams
No sign of rain
Nothing but you and me
There you are, with me in your arms
Ready to take me in
And you know, you can rest your head on my heart
Ooh, you're a place for me to lay down my head
Ooh, and you're a place for me to settle down
Ooh, we were meant to be
Ooh, we were meant, oh you
Ooh, I'll be your shelter and I'll be your shore
You, you're all around me
No sign of darkness
Nothing but you and me
Days go by with you in my eyes
A thousand flowers unfold
Safe together, always forever
Watching each other grow old
Ooh, you're a place for me to lay down my head
Ooh, you're a place for me to settle down
Ooh, we were meant to be
Ooh we were meant, oh you and me
Ooh I'll be your shelter and I'll be your shore
Ooh, you're a place for me to lay down my head
Ooh, you're a place for me to settle down
Ooh, we were meant to be
Ooh, we were meant, oh you
Ooh, I'll be your shelter and I'll be your shore
Ooh, I'll be your shelter and I'll your shore
I'll be your shelter and I'll be your shore
