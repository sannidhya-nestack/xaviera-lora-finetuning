Glowing bubbles, filled with colors, they burst in the bright blue sky
I'll be dreaming of you for a lifetime or two
You'll always find a way to make me smile
While everybody else is busy buttoning up
We'll be pulling out the rug from the world
We live, we laugh, we love in color
Live, we laugh, we love in color, color
You taste so candy, so sugar sweet
I drink you in to wash it down
You're flooding my heart and I'm splashing around and down and then I never wanna get out
While everybody else is busy tidying up
We'll be shooting fireworks over the sun
We live, we laugh, we love, in color
Live, we laugh, we love, in color, color
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We live, we laugh, we love, in color
We live, we laugh, we love, in color
We live, we laugh, we love, in color
In color, in color
In Calais
