I once was the captain of a beautiful ship
With tall leather white sails
She could charge through the calm deep white ocean
And dance through the strongest gale
From the horizon you could hear her scream
From behind the long sun veil
But she could sing so sweet
As sweet as the sisters who were lashed with mutiny's tale
Yo-o-o-o-o-o
The body ships she floats
Did it, yes she goes
I once was a captain of a mighty ship
With a crew so daring and brave
They would die for the taste of salt on their lips
To be buried in an iron weight
They struck fear through the coldest and hardest of hearts
Spared no beast till it was tame
And we entered each battle in glorious hell
Left with only our souls to save
Yo-o-o-o-o-o-o
The bunny ships she floats
Yo-o-o-o-o-o-o
Steady as she goes
You're the body ships she floats
You're steady as she goes
I once was the captain of a terrible ship
We done many terrible things
We took a young girl, yes a beautiful child
As fresh as the spring
And we tied her to the mast and we raped
And we cheated her of all the beauty nature could bring
Now she lives with her sisters, oh sweet little sisters without even a note to sing
Yo ho ho, the bonnie ship she floats
Yo ho ho, steady
Boy, as you go
