With the leaves all alight on the pavement
And the colors sucked out of the sky
This autumn is falling down all round our shoulders
And you look like you wanna lay down and cry
But my dear, it'll soon be the new year
And we'll both have a chance to pick up this romance
To wipe its face dry of the tears
And to dance as if it were the first dance
To go walk in the park, make love in the dark
For the future to outshine the past
Well it's all in the way that you say things
Like those leaves blowing out in the street
They're yellow and older there
Fire and gold and a cold wind
Just might blow us back on our feet
my dear, it'll soon be the new year
And we'll both have a chance to recapture romance
To make love with no wine or beer
And to dance as if it were the last dance
For you to smile and to kiss me
To say, "Yeah, you've missed me"
For the future to outshine the past
And all the winter is dark but it's fleeting
And hell it's over before it begins
The flowers lie waiting to burst through the soil
And reach for the sun and the sky once again
And my dear, it'll soon be the new year
And we'll each have a chance to pick up this romance
And wipe our eyes dry of the tears
And to dance as if it were a new chance
To be just like before, only better and more
For the future to outshine the past
