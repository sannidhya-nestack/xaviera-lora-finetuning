Once a jolly swagman, camped by a billabong, Under the shade of a koolabah tree
He sang as he watched, and waited till his billy boiled
You come a-waltzing Matilda with me
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me
He sang as he watched
And waited till his billy boiled
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me
Down came a jumbuck to drink at the pillabong up
Jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee
He sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tuckabag
You come a-waltzing Matilda with me
Waltz and Matilda, Waltz and Matilda
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me
He sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me
Up rolled the squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred up
Rolled the troopers, one, two, three
With that jolly jumper that you've got in your tucker bag
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me
With that jolly jumbuck that you've got in your tucker bag
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me
Well up jumped the swagman and sprang into the billabong
You'll never take me alive said he
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me
Waltz in Matilda, Waltz in Matilda
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me
