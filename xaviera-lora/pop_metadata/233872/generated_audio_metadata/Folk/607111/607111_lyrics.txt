I'm feeling emotional
Can't seem to control my emotions
I'm walking but I don't feel my feet
Somehow I don't feel complete
Lately much has been running through my mind
I don't feel like I'm a part of any space or time
I'm waiting for things to get better, what's better?
I don't know anymore
Looks like I'm always running for the front door
Looking for an escape, looking for a better place
Where should I look, where will I find
Where will I find some peace of mind
And suddenly a voice called out to me
Soft, sweet, ever so gently saying
Come my child, lay on my breast
I'll surely take care of the rest
I smile for my rescue is come
I no longer feel like I'm the only one
Crying all night and day
Now all I do is constantly pray
I'm learning he loves me unconditionally
He loves me unconditionally
That's what he said
He said come my child lay your burdens on me
And I'll help you get back on your feet
Hey I don't worry no more like I did before
Because I know what he has in store
He said come my child lay upon my breast
Worry no more, I'll take care of the rest
Call my child, cast your burdens on me
Come and learn and live in love eternally
Come on, child
