Fair enough, then you say farewell
Guess I'll drown me in a wishing well
I'll wish for hellos and hi's
Good for nothing is the word goodbye
Now the lights are dim and that's a fact
I'm an old magician, you're a vanishing act
With my top hat and your rabbit eyes
Good for nothing is the word goodbye
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
