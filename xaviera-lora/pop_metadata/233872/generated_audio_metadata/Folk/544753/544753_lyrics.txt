Here I am, back to see you again
those were the days we lived back then
Walking with you along the starry sand
Oh I wish I had stayed with you and never gone
The world was ours so young and so free
Living on nothing but sun and air you and me
And dreams of success
That's what I wanna be
And time was ours walking round Paris
So I've come back to see you, but everything seems to be gone
I walk around thinking that maybe you were the one
Here no dreams, no means of survival, just get the work done
Hear no time to sit there and take in the morning sun
So I've come back to see you and I'm coming back again
those were the days we lived back then
Walking with you along the starry sand
Oh, I wish I had stayed with you and never gone
Never gone
Oh, I wish I had stayed with you and never gone
