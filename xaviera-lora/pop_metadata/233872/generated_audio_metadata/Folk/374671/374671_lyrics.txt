Won't you come home, Jill Daly, won't you come home
He moans the whole day long
I'll do the cookin', darling, I'll pay the rent
Oh yes, I will, I know I've done you wrong
Remember that rainy evening that I drove you out
With nothing but a fine tooth comb
I know I'm to blame, ain't that a shame
Jill Daly won't you please come home
Won't you come home, Jill Daly? Won't you come home?
He moans the whole day long
I'll do the cookin' darlin', I'll pay the rent
I know I've done you wrong
Remember that rainy evening that I drove you out
With nothing but a fine tooth comb
I know I'm to blame
Now ain't that a shame
Jill Daly won't you please come
Jill Daly won't you please come
Jill Daly won't you please come home
