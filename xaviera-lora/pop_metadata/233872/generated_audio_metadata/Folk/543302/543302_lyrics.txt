I've been looking around so long
Trying to work my way back home
I ain't gonna slow down'til I get there
Sitting watching the rain falling
I can hear my dreams calling
Even when the wheels are turning round and round
Kinda makes you believe when you need it to sun and rain
And I've got no way of knowing this time if it's coming back again
I can't shake this load but I need to go away from here
And your bird might sing it don't mean a thing without you
Kinda funny how time moves on
Turn around and it might be gone
But I really don't mind
It goes
So I'll keep looking around so long
Try to work my way back home
And I ain't gonna slow down'til I get there
Kinda makes you believe when you needed the sun it rained
And I've got no way of knowing this time
If it's coming back again
I can shake this snow
But I need to go away from here
And your bird might sing
It don't mean a thing without
It's better you leave now
It's better you go away
I don't wanna mess around
