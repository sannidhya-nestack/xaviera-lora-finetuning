If I had a brother, he would have the talent
And I would have the love and all the shame
If I had a brother he would sing the songs
While I stood waiting unheard in the rain
Keeping company with ponies and the lonely girl's dreams
And if I had a brother though I may not be the better man
It wouldn't change those things you see in me
That wouldn't change those things you see in me
If I had a brother he would speak with silver tongue
Easily beguiling me and everyone he met
If I had a brother, he'd be graceful as he danced
While I'd be grateful for the laughter of a friend
Keeping company with ponies and a lonely girl's dreams
And if I had a brother, though I may not be the better man
It wouldn't change those things you see in me
That wouldn't change those things you see in me
If I had a brother
He'd know just who and where he was
While I would be adrift still reaching for the shore
Drowning in his shadow cast just there across the floor
If I had a brother I'd still be
I'd still be
Keeping company with ponies and a lonely girl's dreams
And if I had a brother, though I may not be the better man
It wouldn't change those things you see in me
That wouldn't change those things you see in me
It wouldn't change those things you see in me
That wouldn't change those things you say in me
