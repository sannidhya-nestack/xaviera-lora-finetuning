It was June twenty-third, eighteen-eighty-one
In the skies of Malkaios, a storm had begun
The Morelos Line rail and a twin-headed train
Started off that dark night through Samarian rain
With an engine in front and one pushed behind
There were ten cars in all on the narrow gauge line
Eighty barrels of brandy and two hundred plus men
They loaded all that they had on Moreno's train ten
Oh the lightning it clapped and the thunder it rolled
The unforeseen flood that night took its toll
She washed out the farms and the missions of old
But the train and the men labored on with their load
It's parting down and around in vain
Pounding on all the deluvian rain down, round down
Half blind from the deluge, the breakman did not know
As he neared the Baranka with the river below
The great storm and her hunger had devoured the bridge
And the train never slowed as they plunged from the ridge
It's tumbling, stumbling, rumbling on
The dissonant screams of all hope is gone down, down, down
The Brillo's lay mangled, wedged hard in the mud
The brandy spilled out to blend with the blood
And when the engines caught fire their fumes fueled the flame
Taking all that was left of the Morelos Line train
On June 23, 1881
