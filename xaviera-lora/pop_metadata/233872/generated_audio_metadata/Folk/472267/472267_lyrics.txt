And here she comes again
Riding on the wind
Taking her time
Slowly winding in
And why is it so damn hard
To look into her eyes
She takes it as it comes
She tries to throw the line
She tries to throw the line
And here she comes again
Riding the whiskey wind
The sun rushing through her hair
Cold chill take me there
Riding the whiskey wind
She rides through the fields
On her golden mare
Taking her time
Slowly getting there
Winding her way through
The puzzles of my life
She takes it so hard
She tries to throw the line
She tries to throw the line
And here she comes again
Right in the whiskey wind
The sun rushing through her hair
Cold chill take me there
Right in the whiskey wind
Here she comes again
Riding the whiskey winds
The sun rushing through her hair
Cold chill take me there
Riding whiskey wind
