It's time to party, time to prance
Work week's over, let's go dance
It's time to party, time to prance
Work week's over, let's go dance
Is it L .A., is it France, is it New York
Just to dance, just to dance
Oh, is it LA, is it France, is it New York?
Just to dance
Just to dance
Dance with me
The lights go out, the night gets long
But we're still about to still go dance
The lights go out, the night gets long
But we're still about to still go dance
Or is it LA, is it France, is it New York
Just to dance, just to dance
Or is it L .A., is it France, is it New York?
Just to dance
Just to dance, oh
Is it L .A., is it France, is it New York?
Just to dance, just to dance
Or is it L .A., is it France, is it New York?
Just to dance, just to dance
Just to dance, just to dance
