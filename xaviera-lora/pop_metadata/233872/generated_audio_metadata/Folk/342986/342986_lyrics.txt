A fire in her eyes sending chills through his spine
She loves to tease and play games with his mind
The want in his soul is eternally fed
A passion that hungers is easily led
Dance in time with me moving a rhyme
Dance in time with the rhythm sublime
Frozen in time
The hunter has wounded and now she must kill
This is the part that provides her thrill
The pain in his heart will evermore stay
When she casts him aside for a new game to play
Dad's in time with me moving, oh right
Dad's in time with the rhythm sublime
Frozen in time
His hand it trembles with anticipation
She beckons him near
They dance in time as they move in a rhyme
The rhythm is ever so clear
The fire in his eyes sending chills through her spine
He loves to tease and play games with her mind
The want in her soul is eternally fed
A passion that hungers is easily led
Dance in time with me moving a rhyme
Dance in time with the rhythm sublime
Frozen in time
