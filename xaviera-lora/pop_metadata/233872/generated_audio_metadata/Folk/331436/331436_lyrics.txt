Come on to Sloop John B
My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinkin' all night
Got into a fight, yeah yeah
Well I feel so break up
I wanna go home
So hoist up the John B. sails
See how the mainsail sets
Send for the captain ashore
Let me go home
I wanna go home
Please let me go home
Yeah yeah
Yeah I feel so break up
I wanna go home
Where the first mate he got drunk
Broke up somebody's trunk
Constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff Johnstone, please leave me alone
Yeah yeah, well I fear this'll break up
I wanna go home
So hoist up the John B. sails
See how the mainsail sets
Send for the captain ashore
Let me go home
I wanna go home
Please let me go home
Yeah yeah
Well I feel so break up
I wanna go home
Poor Cook he got the fits
He ate up all of my grits
Then he went and he ate up all of my corn
Oh let me go home
Why don't you let me go home
Yeah yeah
This is the worst trip I've ever been on
So hoist up the John B. sails
See how the mainsail sets
Send for the captain ashore
Let me go home
I wanna go home
Please let me go home
Yeah yeah
I feel so break up
I want to go home
So hoist up the John B. sails
See how the mainsail sets
Send for the captain ashore
Let me go home
I wanna go home
Please let me go home, yeah yeah
I feel so break up
I wanna go home
This is the worst trip I've ever been on
