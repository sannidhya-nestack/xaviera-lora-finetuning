I made my mind up and it became clear
I put the walls up so no one comes near
I rode my bike straight off the rails
Into the drink there's nowhere to fail
But I must admit I'm happy that you missed me
I can't remember what I ot
I begged the piper and asked him to stop
I want my baby lemonade back
Be like a terrapin in a wolf pack
But I must admit I'm happy that you kiss me
Hiding in the garden, spying on me
They call it love, it's more like a crime scene
otten the words, they've changed all the tunes
I always look on the bright side of the moon
I want my baby lemonade back
I feel like a terrapin in a walk back
But I must admit I'm happy when you kiss me, yeah
Diddly diddly diddly diddly diddly diddly diddly diddly diddly
