The capital ship for an ocean trip was the walloping window blind
No wind that blew dismayed her crew or troubled the captain's mind
The man at the wheel was made to feel contempt for the wildest blow
But it often appeared when the gale had cleared he'd been in his bunk below
So blow your winds high ho, I'll robe and I will go
I'll stay in your own infatuation, so let the music play
I'm off on the morning train, I'll cross the bounding main
I'm off to my love with a boxing glove, ten thousand miles away
The bosun's maid was very sedate, yet fond of amusement too
He played on Scotch and the starboard watch while the captain tickled the crew
The gunner we had was apparently mad'cause she sat on the after rail
And Byron salutes in the captain's boots and the teeth of a blooming gale
So throw your wins high-ho, I'm roaming, I will go
I'll stay no longer, so let the music play
I'm off on the morning train across the bounding main
I'm off to my love with a boxing glove ten thousand miles away
The captain sat on a commodore's hat and dined in a royal way
Off roasted pigs and pickles and figs and gummery bread each day
Our cookie was Dutch and behaved as such for the diet he fed the crew
Was a couple of tons of hot cross buns served up with sugar and glue
So blow your winds high, ho, I'll robe and I will go
I'll stay to know'em more, so let the music play
I'm off on the morning train, across the bounding main
I'm off to my love of the boxing club, ten thousand miles away
And we all fell ill as mariners will on a diet that's cheap and rude
And we shivered and shook as we dipped the cook in a tub of his gruesome food
The nautical pride we laid aside as we cast the vessel ashore
On the gullaby isles where the poo-poo smiles and the anagazanders roar
So go ye winds high-ho, I'm rovin' I will go
I'll stay no more, so let the music play
I'm off on the morning train, across the bounding main
I'm off to my love with a boxing glove, ten thousand miles away
I'm off to my love with a boxing glove ten thousand miles away
I'm off to my love with a boxing glove ten thousand miles away
