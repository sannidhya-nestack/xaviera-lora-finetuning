As I was a-fishin' up in the Gulf
Out on the open sea
I think of those pretty girls back on shore
And wish that they were out here with me
So step on board (step on board) the ocean liner
Step on board without delay, me lads
Step on board, there's nothin' finer
And together we'll sail away
Well, I made up me mind to follow the waves
Hearing of good returns
And the very next morning I found myself
Prawning and me stomach it began to churn
So step on board (step on board) the ocean liner
Step on board without delay, me lads
Step on board, there's nothing finer
And together we'll sail away
Working twenty bloody four hours a day
With me eyes hanging out of me head
Twenty four hours barely making a wage
And wish that I was bloody well dead
So step on board the ocean liner
Step on board without delay, relax
Step on board there's nothing finer
And together we'll sail away
Well, I'm a long way from mother up here in the Gulf
A long way from family
And I'm a bloody long way from being a
Ball player
A microscopist
A dentist
A cattle rustler
A rabbi
A boy that me mother also wanted me to be
So step on board, step on board the ocean liner
Step on board without delaying me lads
Step on board there's nothing finer
And together we'll sail away
Well, the captain's a big man, he stands so high
His head's nearly touching the ringin'
And the crew, they're all druggles and they're so high
I think they've left the land of the living
So step on board, step on board the ocean liner
Step on board without delaying, me lads
Step on board, there's nothing finer
And together we'll sail away
Well, we're catching and shelling and sorting prawns
they bloody well come out of our ears
And the cook gives me chills in more ways than one
And I think I'm on my very last run
So step on board, step on board the ocean liner (step on board)
Step on board without delaying me lads
Step on board, there's nothing finer
And together we'll sail away
Step on board, step on board the ocean liner
Step on board without delay me lads
Step on board there's nothing finer
And together we'll sail away
And together we will sail away
