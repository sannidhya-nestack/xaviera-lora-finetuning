Don't say you love me
Then leave the country
Don't say I'm yours
Then walk right out the door
Don't leave your jacket
On my front seat
Because your absence
It leaves me thirsty
Yeah, I've been waiting for you
And you've been waiting too
And God knows I want you back
But I'm also happy you left
So now my shadows (now my shadows)
Walk all alone
Under the sunlight
Hey when you're coming home
You took my picture
To remember
The face that you loved
But all you left me was an empty home
And I've been waiting for you
And you've been waiting too
And God knows I want you back
But I'm also happy you left
Yeah, I've been waiting for you
And you've been waiting too
And God knows I want you back
But I'm also happy you left
now there's no doubt in my mind
I've loved you from the ancient times
In this silly, silly way
That makes me want you, miss you, love you, need you, I miss you, love you, need you, want you, need you, want you, I need you, I want you
That you would follow love, love, love
Left to follow love, love, love
Yeah it's love, love, love, love
True love is love, love, love
