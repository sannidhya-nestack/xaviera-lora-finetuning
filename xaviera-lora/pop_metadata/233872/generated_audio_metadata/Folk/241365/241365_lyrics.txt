Lay down, my dear brother, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head down upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
I'm bitchy goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I'm bitchy goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Lay down, my dear sister
Lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head down
Upon your savior's breast
Well, I love you
Oh, but Jesus loves you the best
I bet you goodnight
Good night, good night
Well I love you oh but Jesus loves you the best
I bid you good night, good night, good night
And I bid you good night, good night, good night
And I bid you good night
Good night, good night
And I'm bitchy good night
Good night, good night
