Someday the sun will shine
And let your dream come true
No need to worry now
It lights a path for you
Someday your time will come
You'll learn to fly
You'll soar above the skylark
And the song it sings
Our times come to pass into the night
Sunrise and morning dew shed a new light
Sometimes your wishes don't always come true
But with belief someday they're sure to do
Someday, always, live for someday
Live out your dreams and then
Believe and in someday
We'll become one day
A dream come true for you
Sometimes the stars will shine in your eyes at night
While dreaming thoughts of passing years to find a path of light
Wishing worlds will all be yours and you'll see too
Believe in dreams always, always come true
Think not of things to come out of the blue
There's going to be always a few
Sometimes your wishes don't always come true
With self belief someday they're sure to do
Someday, always live for someday
Live out your dreams and then
Believe in it someday
We'll become one day
A dream come true for you
Believe and in some day
We'll become one day
A dream come true for you
