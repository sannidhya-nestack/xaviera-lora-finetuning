Will you settle down
I wish you would
Hear my side of it
I was so far gone
I never should
Brought you close to me
And I know you're not the kind of girl
To hang around and put up with this
And you know I'm not the kind of boy
To fool around to get over you
Will you come back home
I wish you would
Cause I'm over it
And I'll treat you like a doll
I'll hold you close
And won't let go of you
And I know you're not the kinda girl
To hang around and put up with this
And you know I'm not the kinda boy
To fool around and get over you
Oh, oh, oh
