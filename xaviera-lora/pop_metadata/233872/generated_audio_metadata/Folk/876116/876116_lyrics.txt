They tell the tale at harvest time of a man they call John Barleycorn
A young man cut down in his prime so that his soul might be reborn
His seed is put into the ground and as the season turns around
He rises up to meet the sky only to be cut down by the harvest
When the seasons come and go
High and mighty are laid low
Hand the reaper what you sow
For you will climb
But then it's time to be ready for the harvest
John Barleycorn will pay the price, our daily bread and grain to yield
Cut down as a sacrifice like youth upon the battlefield
What a gift he has to give, that he should die that we might live
Then can know no greater love and we enjoy the blessings of the harvest
Round the seasons come and go
High and mighty are laid low
And the reaper watch you so
For you will climb
But then it's time to be ready for the harvest
And in the gather do you feel
One more turning of the wheel?
Remember when you sow the seed, the neck that feels the reaper's blade
So your life becomes indeed, the corners turned and choices made
Remember when you seek the light, to every morning comes the night
And when you feast and have your fill, don't et it's only till the harvest
Round the seasons come and go
High and mighty or laid low
Hand the reap of what you sow
For you will climb
But then it's time to be ready for the harvest
Round the seasons come and go (round the seasons come and go)
High and mighty are they low (high and mighty are they low)
And the reaper won't you stop (the reaper comes and he will climb)
If then it's time to be ready for (if then it's time to be ready for)
The harvest
Lost
