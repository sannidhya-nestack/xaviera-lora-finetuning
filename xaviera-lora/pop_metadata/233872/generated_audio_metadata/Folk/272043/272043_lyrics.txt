Oh angel, I see you walk through my dreams
Late at night when the drink wears off
Oh angel, I follow where you lead
To the steep wall of sorrow
And I looked down and I got crazy
At the sight of the depth of my own sadness
And I reach out to touch you baby
But you're not there, you never were
Not like I needed
It's just a dream
Oh angel, I see you stand
On the edge of a road that leads to nowhere
Oh angel, I stop my car to let you in
baby, I'm hitting that wind
I look out and I go crazy
To the beat of the wipers on our windshield
And I reach out to touch you baby
But it's only the dial of my radio I feel
It's just a dream
Hello.
Angel, I hear your voice in the sound of my lone guitar playing
And oh, angel, I stay by your hand
But it's only the cold winds a-blowing
And I look out through my window
To the black of the night that surrounds me
I can't go on without you baby
I know it's just as well if I can't tell what's to live for
But a dream
