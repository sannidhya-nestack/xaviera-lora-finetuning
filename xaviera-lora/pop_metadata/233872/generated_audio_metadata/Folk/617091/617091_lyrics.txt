I've followed my heart, made many mistakes, thus the long delay
Felt the heat of goddesses and the tongues of snakes, you have found your way
Got fixed and then broke
Caged and set free
Don't look back too long
Sometimes it's unreal to think it was me
You must carry on
Light, right, right from the heart
My son, he's a dreamer, ironclad in a badly managed world
I hope he will learn not to be mad, keep your flags unfurled
The long way around's the harder deal, such is our destiny
But in the end, you know what is real
Rivers to the sea
Light, right, right from the heart
Choose not the superficial, speak with care
Singing right from the heart
It's hard to be simple, but you'll get there
The end's a very good start
My lady she's a joy, the best that can be
Hold her not too tight
I thank her every day for comforting me
And help her through the night
Light, right, right from the heart
Life, rise, right from the heart
