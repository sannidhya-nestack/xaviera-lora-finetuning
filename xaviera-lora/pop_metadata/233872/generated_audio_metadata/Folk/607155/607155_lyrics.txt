Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
I looked over Jordan and what did I see?
Coming for to carry me home
A band of angels coming after me
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
If you get there
Before I do
Coming for to carry me home
Just tell all my friends
I'm coming too
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low
Sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
