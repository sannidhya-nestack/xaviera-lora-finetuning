Walking by the water, pushing one another, I've always liked this game
Your hand seems so much stronger
Your stride a little longer
You're slow to match my pace
It's been a good day
No stress, no pain
I wish it was always this way
So I'll soak up every kiss
Let the sun warm my skin
And just enjoy the day
I take in all the sights
While we're walking side by side
Oh, untouchable by time
Like being wrapped in vivid light
Oh, I'm feeling good, oh, I'm feeling fine
All is well in this world of mine
New things to do and time to buy
Breathing out worries and breathing in light
I don't like it when it rains
You kinda scrunch up your face
I smile and toss some boots your way
In the calm after the storm
It becomes nature's dance floor
Let's bottlejump from place to place
I take in all the sights
While we're walking side by side
Oh, untouchable by time
Like being wrapped in vivid light
Oh, I'm feeling good, oh, I'm feeling fine
All is well in this world of mine
You're least to turn, oh, in time to buy
Breathing out worries and breathing in
I'm feeling good, oh, I'm feeling fine
All is well in this world of mine
You're least to turn, oh, in time to buy
Breathing out worries and breathing in
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling fine
All is well in this world of mine
New leaves to turn and time to bite
Breathing out worries and breathing in
I'm feeling good, oh, I'm feeling fine
All is well in this world of mine
New leaves to turn, oh, and time to buy
Breathing out worries and breathing in
La la la la la, la la la la la la, la la la la la la, la la
La la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la, la la la la la
