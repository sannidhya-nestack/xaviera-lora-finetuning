It was Friday morning when we set sail and we were far from land
When I did spy a mermaid so fair with the comb and the glass in her hand
And the ocean waves did roll
And the stormy winds did blow
And we brave sailor lads were skipping at their top
While those land lovers lied down below, below, below
While those land lovers lied down below
Then up spoke the captain of our gallant ship
And a good old man was he
This fishy mermaid has warned us of our doom
And will sink to the bottom of the sea
For the ocean waves did roll
And the stormy winds did blow
And we brave zealads were skipping at the top
While those Latin lovers lied down below
Below below
While those Latin lovers lied down below
Then up spoke the mate of our gallant ship
And a brave good man was he
He said, "I have a wife in Edinburgh town
And tomorrow a widow she will be"
For the ocean waves did roll, and the stormy winds did blow
And we brave sailors as we're skipping at the top
While those land lovers lie down below, below, below
While those land lovers lie down below
Then up spoke the cabin boy of our gallant ship
And a brave young man was he
He said I have a sweetheart in Port Royal
And tomorrow she'll be crying for me
For the ocean waves did roll, and the stormy winds did blow
And we brave sailors as we're skipping at the top
While those Latin lovers lie down below, below, below
While those Latin lovers lie down below
Then up spoke the cook of our gallant ship
And a greasy old butcher was he
He said I care more for me pots and pans
Than I do for the bottom of the sea
Well, the ocean waves did roll
And the stormy winds did blow
And we brave sailor lads were skipping at the top
While those landlubbers lied down below, below, below
While those landlubbers lied down below
Then three times round spun our gallant ship
And three times round spun she
While three times round spun our gallant ship
And she sank to the bottom of the sea
While the ocean waves did roll
And the stormy winds did blow
And we brave sailors as we're skipping at the top
While those land lovers lie down below, below, below
While those land lovers lie down below
