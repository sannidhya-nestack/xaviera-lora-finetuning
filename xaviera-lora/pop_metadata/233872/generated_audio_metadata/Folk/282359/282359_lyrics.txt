We don't know where we're rowin'
Don't know which way we're blowin'
We don't know where we're goin'
As we toss and roll
Well, David is the worst kinda ragtag sailor
Stench like a score of scurvy-struck whalers
His clothes are supplied by flying drunk tailors
As we toss and roll
Don't, don't know where we're rowin'
Don't, don't know which way we're blowin'
We don't, don't know where we're goin'
As we toss and roll
Now Dino's got the stuff of a good million
Force wind, it barely tips in
But after a couple of pints he's whistin'
As we toss and roll
Don't, don't know where we're goin'
Don't, don't know which way we're blowin'
We don't, don't know where we're goin'
As we toss and roll
Gina sails with a barrel of ginger Without it the slightest swells unhinged
She and her sister like cringe and cringer As we toss and roll
Don't know where we're going Don't know which way we're blowing
Don't know where we're going As we toss and roll
Christy sails a lot like her sister Gina
Gets just as sick but a little bit meaner
Staggers the decks like a drunken ballerina
As we toss and roll
Don't know where we're going
Don't know which way we're blowing
Don't know where we're going
As we toss and roll
Maggie is our sure and steadfast gunner
Always on the lookout for loot and plunder
Sweet and delicate, voice like thunder
As we toss and roll
Don't know where we're going
Don't know which way we're blowing
Don't know where we're going
As we toss and roll
John has the focus of a drunken monkey
Can't hide the fact he's a juggling junkie
Never in his life settled on just one key
As we toss and roll
Don't know where we're going
Don't know which way we're going
We don't know where we're going
As we toss and roll
We don't know where we're going
Don't know which way we're blowin'
We don't know where we're goin'
As we toss and roll
