All the things we might have had are
Mounted'round my shoulders
And some are good and some are bad but
I still want you
Not an empty word was spoken
No secret bullet waiting
No subterfuge or counter strokes
Just open invitations
But I am such a lucky woman
To taste my heart's desire
And now it's gone I understand
What ashes are
To fire
In hidden places of my soul your tender kiss has wandered
And all the emptiness and cold was filled with fire undaunted
But I am such a lucky woman
To taste my heart's desire
And now it's gone I understand what ashes are
To fire
Now I understand
And our two bodies made a pact
And our two minds were kindred
And our two spirits walk the track
All through the burning tinder
All the things we should have hid
But I still want you
But I am such a lucky woman
To taste my heart's desire
And now it's gone I understand
What ashes are
Too far
Now I understand
Now I understand
But ashes are to fire
