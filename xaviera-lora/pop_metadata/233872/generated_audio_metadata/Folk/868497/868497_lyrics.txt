Honey that bomb you dropped on me has rearranged the scenery
And it's so very hard to see beauty in all this debris
Baby that bomb you dropped on me
Sure did blow my love world apart
Like twenty tons of TNT
Exploded just below my heart
Oh girl that bomb you dropped on me
Was my courtesy wake up call
I was asleep but now I see
The absurdity of it all
Honey that bomb you dropped on me
Has rearranged the scenery
And it's so very hard to see
Beauty in all this debris
Now I'm no victim of circumstance
You popped my bubble by pure chance
Step by step I'm learning to dance
In the rubble of our romance
Honey that bomb you dropped on me
Has rearranged the scenery
Made it easier to see
Beauty in all this debris
