All the way back to you
All the way straight to you
All the way home to you
I'm all the way into you
What a love so unique
To pay the bills
I drive the road
So early on
I'm meant to be
And I touched you
I broke your code
And I touched you
I broke the code
All the way back to you
All the way straight to you
All the way home to you
All the way into you
Two of us, I clearly see
In my mirror
As I look behind
You are my love
And my biggest key
A greater love
I will not find a greater love, I could not find
All the way back to you
All the way straight to you
All the way home to you
I'm all the way into you
All the way back to you
All the way straight to you
All the way home to you
I'm all the way into you
I'm all the way into you
The two of us I clearly see
In my mirror
As I look behind
You are my love
And my biggest key, a greater love
I could not find a greater love
I will not find
All the way back to you
All the way straight to you
All the way home to you
All the way into you
