Well I think about it all day long and I dream of it at night
The only thing you'll ever touch it'll make you feel alright
Some people call it bread and others call it dough
But every penny I ever earn I already owe
Because coin is god, cash is king
If you ain't got no money you ain't got anything
I said coin is god, cash is king
If you ain't got no money you ain't got anything oh no
Well every day I go to work to earn my daily bread
But every day some other jerk gets hold of it instead
So I curse the wealthy bankers and the bills I have to pay
I'm always in my overdraft so what else can I say except
Coin is God
Cash is king
If you ain't got no money you ain't got anything I said
Coin is God
Cash is king
If you ain't got no money you ain't got anything oh no
Now my checks all bounce like rubber
Standing orders never stand
My bills exceed my income by well over a grand
There's gotta be a smarter way to bring some money in
at the end of every day I'm in the red again
I said, coin is God, cash is king
If you ain't got no money you ain't got anything
I said, coin is God, cash is king
If you ain't got no money you ain't got anything, oh no
Now I only earn a little, but the taxman wants the lot
He takes forfeits of what I earn and half of what I got
He spends it all on wars, I don't believe in any way
Then he charges me for letters when I can't afford to pay
Well the bank said let us help you here's some money you can borrow
But every penny that we lend you'll pay us twice tomorrow
I work a little harder try and put in longer days
Just so I can give my friend the tax man a raise
I said coin is god cash is king
If you ain't got no money you ain't got anything
I said coin is god cash is king
If you ain't got no money you ain't got anything oh no
uno, due, tre, quattro, cinque, sei,
Coin is God, cash is king
If you ain't got no money, you ain't got anything
I said
Coin is God, cash is king
If you ain't got no money
You ain't got anything
