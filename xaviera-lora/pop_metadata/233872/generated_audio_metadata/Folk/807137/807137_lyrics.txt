Looming mountain silhouettes
Dense clouds must go back to that
Smells moist and humid
Fresh and free
Yet you stop and think of me
And you taste
The time to say
This place is different
In every kind of way
And I wish you were here today
Today
Thirteen story high rise block
Green leaves cut against the grey blue
Illuminated
Fresh and new
Yet I'm stopping in between
Things that I
Have not yet seen
This place is different
In every kind of way
And I wish you
Were here today
Today
In the end
The start begins again
Circumnavigate your feelings
Cyclically you make amends
Your bonds are breaking
Dissipating
Life takes on a new perspective
And I hear you say every day
And I hear you every day
And I hear you
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know
