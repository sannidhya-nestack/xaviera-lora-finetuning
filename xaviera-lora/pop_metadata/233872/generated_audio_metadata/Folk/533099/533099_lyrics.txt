You are my morning
You are my evening
You are my daytime too
I ain't never leaving
You are my sun in the sky
You are my star
You are my everything, just the way you are
You are my night times, you are my dreams
You are my good times too
You are my queen
You are my everything
You are my home
And I know you're with me
Where'er I roam
You are my morning
You are my eve
You are my daytime too
And I'll never leave
You are my victory
You are my whole
You are my everything
You are my all
You are my everything
You are my whole
And I know you're with me
Where'er I roam
You are my everything
You are my home
And I know you're with me
Where'er I roam
Yeah I know you're with me
Way rare I know
