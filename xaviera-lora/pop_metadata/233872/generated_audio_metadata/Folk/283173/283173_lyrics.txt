Do you remember those warm nights in June
When we both were still just farmer's kids
And we walked out beneath that summertime moon
And it gave its permission for the things we did
And the crickets played rhythm to the beat of my heart
While I tasted life's many delights
In the shadow of the new moon
Behind the old barn
On those magic firefly nights
Those magic firefly nights
And we danced in the circle of the firefly light
In the sweet green fields of summer hay
And I called you my lover for the very first time
I remember it like it was yesterday
And the crickets played rhythm to the beat of my heart
While I tasted life's many delights
In the shadow of the new moon behind the old barn
On those magic firefly nights
Those magic firefly nights
And the crickets played rhythm to the beat of my heart
While I tasted life's many delights
In the shadow of the new moon
Behind the old barn
On those magic firefly nights
Those magic firefly eyes
