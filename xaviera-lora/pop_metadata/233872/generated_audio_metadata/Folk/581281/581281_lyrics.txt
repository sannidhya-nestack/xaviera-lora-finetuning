One hand covering your eye, you're looking far away
Dawn's light filters through the leaves, shadows dance across your face
Words carried by the wind, tell you everything I feel
Oh won't you come along with me
Dreaming and breathing in the shade
Dreaming and breathing in the shade
Birds serenade the breeze as the summer sings along
For now there's nothing to be done
So I hum my favorite song
Little creatures stir about
Causing one of us to shout
Don't reveal their identity
Dreaming and breathing in the shade
We're dreaming and breathing in the shade
Here I want for nothing at all
Now there's a door where there once was a wall
Portraits painted on the clouds can be anything we want
On this world that rests against the sky
Chasing stars across the Milky Way
Here I want for nothing at all
Now there's a door where there once was a wall
Ba da ba da ba da da da da da
We're dreaming in the shade
We're dreaming in the shade
Dreaming in the shade
