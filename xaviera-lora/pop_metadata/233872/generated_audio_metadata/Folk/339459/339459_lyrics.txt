My cast of characters
You're with me every place I go
Like the cover of Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
You're the stars in my personal show
And I wanna thank you so
My cast of characters
So colorful in every way
Like a lizard on a windowpane
You make me see things in a different way
I just wanna say
You're my prescription lenses
You're my secret weapon
You're my stairway to heaven
Friends, you're on my mind
And there's so many words to say for what I feel inside
But I can't find any that sound new
So I hope you don't mind if I borrow a few
My cast of characters
You hold the net out for me when I fall
Even when I come up with that goal over my face
You still embrace me egg and all
And I wanna thank you all
You're my rescue mission, you're my drug of choice
You give me back my vision, help me find my voice
You turn my solo song into a symphony
You keep me going strong, please don't give up on me
Friends, you're on my mind
And there's so many words to say for what I feel inside
But I can't find any that sound new
So I hope you don't mind if I borrow a few
Friends, you're on my mind
And there's so many words to say for what I feel inside
But I can't find any that sound new
So I hope you don't mind if I borrow a few
And I get by with a little help from you
And I get high with a little help from you
And I only hope that you
Will count me in your cast of characters too
