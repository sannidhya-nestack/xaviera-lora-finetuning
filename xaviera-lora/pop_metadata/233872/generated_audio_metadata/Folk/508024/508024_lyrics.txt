Drop the big one
Go ahead and make my day
There's nothing much I really liked about this planet anyway
Just make sure I'm the first one you drop it on
Drop the big one
Go ahead and drop the bomb
The politicians lie to make sure no one misbehaves
They're mouthing words like freedom
Wearing clothing made by slaves
And so before this whole thing comes unglued
Let's all admit we're screwed
There's just one thing I ask of you
And you and you and you and you drop
The big one, go ahead and end it all
Blast those tailgating cell phone screamers
Speeding to the mall
Attention Kmart shoppers
Kindly remain calm
Drop the big one
Go ahead and drop the bomb
I long ago stopped hoping some superhero would save the day
I never did like living at ground zero anyway
Now there's a flash appearing in my dreams
Accompanied by seven billion screams
I think we all know what that means
It means drop the big one
Oh the humanity
And then we'll be one big happy nuclear family
Don't need to save nobody
Well maybe just my mom
Drop the big one
Go ahead and drop the bomb
Drop the big one
Drop the big one
Drop the big one
