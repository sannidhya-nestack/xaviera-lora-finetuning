I once shared a dream with a man of a curse
You could tell from his voice there was never a choice
There was only one path and they stood in our way
And now I'm sentenced to die for these glorious days
I fought for survival, for freedom of rights
And God was on my side
I did what I had to, I did what I could
For this brotherhood
For our brotherhood
I'm the scapegoat because I would never deny
Committed no crimes I fought on the right side
I will always see faces of men that I've killed
'Cause my soul is tainted with the blood that I've spilled
Won't go down on my knees, I won't beg, I won't plead
you still will kill me
Then you'll be the killer and I'll be the ghost
That'll haunt you the most
I'll be that ghost
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
