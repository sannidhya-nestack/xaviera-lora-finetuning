You're the Russian with the green eyes
You're the lady with the dirty blonde hair
I wanna kiss you, I don't wanna try
I wanna hold you and I'm gonna let you get away
You're the figure standing in my dreams
I hang with lots of people in my dreams
But you're the only one that really appears
And I'll have to ask somebody what that means, yeah
You know I ain't afraid anymore
I'm not afraid to try so I
Ain't afraid of you anymore
I light a candle in your night
I tattooed Saturn on my wrist
Cause you're the woman that stands so tall
And you're the only one that reappears in my dreams
You know I ain't afraid anymore
I'm not afraid to try
So I ain't afraid of you anymore
You know I ain't afraid anymore
I'm not afraid to try
So I'm gonna pick up the phone
I'm gonna give you a call just to see
Just to see what's going on
