Well, it seems like it's only been a fistful of days
Since you scourged my back and sent me on my way
But the voice in my tomb tells me otherwise
With its paraffin breath and its stolen eyes
Oh why did you send him away?
Was it too much to say, no to say?
When there's winter in your blood
And there's hell in your lungs
I danced in a otten tear
It's all gone now
But it used to be here
Now there's 10 ,000 soldiers camped out on the ridge
As the general looks down at a boy on the bridge
And a flash of light from the patriot's gun
Starts 10 ,000 cries, the battle's begun
Why did you send him away?
Was it too much to feign or to say?
When there's winter in your blood
And there's hell in your lungs
A dance and a fog I'd tear
And it's all gone now
But it used to be here
Well I thank you, I thank you for the gifts that you bring
Your empty chest and your bird with one wing
And it flatters me well that pain in your smile
And your shallow attempt to comfort the child
Oh why did you send him away?
Or was it too much to feign or to say
When there's winter in your blood
And there's hell in your lungs
A dance and a otten tear
It's all gone now but it used to be here
