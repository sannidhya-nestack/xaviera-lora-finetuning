My brother's blood flows through my veins
As does mine through his
We think thoughts with the very same brain
We share the same what is
He knows what thoughts run through my mind
He knows what I'll do next
I know the clothes that are in his closet
For work, for Sunday best
Brothers most special people
Right down to the DNA we're equal
When he gets hurt it hurts me too
Nervous system somehow connected
Even our intuitive hunches
Are from the same place directed
You can talk to a person's father
You can talk to their mother
But to know that person inside out
Spend time with their brother
Brothers most special people
Right down to the DNA we're equal
I know it's not the end
I know it's not the end
My brother's blood flows through my veins
As does mine through his
We think thoughts with the very same brain
We share the same what is
You can talk to a person's father
You can talk to their mother
But to know a person inside out
Spend time with their brother
He's my brother
Knows me better than any other
