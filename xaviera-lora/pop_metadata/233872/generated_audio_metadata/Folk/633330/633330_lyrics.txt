I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
Sitting off my red sofa
Thinking thousands of how thoughts
As I try to recall
I realize I ot it all
Manor dress in blue
Has a funny smile
The left-handed girl
She screams against the hour
You recorded my voice, keep memories safe
You recorded my voice, keep memories safe
I've never been so old, I've never been so lost
Never been so safe, never been so still
Never been so old, never been so wise
Never been so safe, never been so still
