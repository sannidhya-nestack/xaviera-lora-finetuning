There's Johnny when he was two
And look, there's little Sue
Grandpa picture of you
Uh oh, one with no glue
Turn the page, I want to see
The old photo of you
Look at Joe in that big tree
And there I've skinned my knee
Oh Gramps I love these photos so
But you should not give them away
I must, my dear, I have no room
There is no other way
Accumulation of things for years cannot
Fit in one small room
But these things are not so dear
As calls from you
As when you're near
The photos I will miss, that's true
But not as much as I'd miss you
These things must go
You have no room
There is no other way
Accumulation of things for years
Cannot fit in one small room
But these things are not so dear
As calls from you, as when you're near
The photos I will miss, that's true
But not as much as I'd miss you
I love you, Grandpa
