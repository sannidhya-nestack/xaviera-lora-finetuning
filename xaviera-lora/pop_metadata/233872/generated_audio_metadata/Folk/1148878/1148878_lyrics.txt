We rage, we churn, we never learn
We run deep, we run deep
The beds we make
The valves we break
Spinning deep, spinning deep
Onto the teeth
With nothing much underneath
Pride for the kill from afar
Revolve your tongue
You cheer the damage done
This is who we are
We're hooked, we're led
We're gold spoon fed
Diggin' deep
Diggin' deep
The prayers we howl
Will fail us now
In deep (live the lie, live the lie, vice the lie then label)
With in deep (live the lie, live the lie, vice the lie then label)
Armed with fear
Your favorite sloganeer
Sneers at your life
From afar
And with vulgar tongue
She is the damaged tongue
This is who we are
Who we are
Who we are
This is who we are
This is
Oh, we are
Build the line and lift the line and smash the line and the days go
Lift the line and lift the line and smash the line and the days go
Old Hill King Lyre and his post truth choir with a hijack flags and a book some fire
The light, the light, the light, the light, the light
