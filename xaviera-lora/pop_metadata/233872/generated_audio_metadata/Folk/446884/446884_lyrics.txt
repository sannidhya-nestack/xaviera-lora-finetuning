You wore pink and I wore blue
Some days I spoke just for you
Chaucer had his way with you each and every night
Music was my temptress then, brighter grew the light
Let's spend our lives in awesome state
Let's tell no lies, let's take the bait
Live as if we ended never at this school of forever
Up is down, down is up
We barely sip a brimming cup
Through the history of sound, music led my way
Gladly lost yourself inside metaphor wordplay
Let's spend our lives in awesome state
Let's tell no lies, let's take the bait
Live as if we ended never at this school of forever
We were so young and so carefree
We wished our lives would always be
Wrapped up in this magic graceful place
Free of all responsibility
Let's spend our lives in awesome state
Let's tell no lies, let's take the bait
Live as if we ended never at this school of forever
At this school of forever
