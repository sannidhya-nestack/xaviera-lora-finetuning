When your world is dark, a light not so bright
There is something I will do to make it alright
I'll be there to help you see the light, don't give up the fight
Call my name and I'll be by your side, take the pain away
Your eyes that shone, now the shine has gone
Hurts me so to see you in such pain
Count on me, don't be scared
Of things that worry you when you are sad
I will make you glad
Make you glad I'm yours and you are mine
Now and all the time
Please believe me when I say I will never go away
Wasn't it you that said you'd fight the demons in your head
Make you glad I'm yours and you are mine
Now and all the time
Please believe me when I say I would never go away
Wasn't it you that said you'd fight the demons in your head so
When your day is dark, the light not so bright
There is something you can do to make it alright
Call my name and I'll be by your side
To help you through the deepest darkest night
Tell you it's alright
Call my name and I'll be by your side
Call my name and I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side
