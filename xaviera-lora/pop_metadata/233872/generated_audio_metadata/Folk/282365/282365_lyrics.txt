Farewell to Tarwathi, a due Mormon hill
And the dear land of Crimmend, I'll bid you farewell
I'm bound out for Greenland and ready to sail
In hopes to find riches in hunting
Adieu to my comrades, for a while we must part
And likewise, the dear lass, that fair one, my heart
The cold ice of Greenland, my love will not chill
And the longer my absence, more loving she'll feel
Our ship is a-ringing, she's ready to sail
Our crew they are anxious to follow the whale
Where the icebergs do float and the stormy winds blow
Where the land and the ocean is covered
When we're standing in the light of the world, we're standing in the light of the world, oh, we're standing in the light of the world
The cold coast of Greenland is barren and bare
No sea time, no harvest is ever known, ever known
And the birds are singing sweetly on Mountain and Dale
But there is no bird to sing to the wave
There is no habitation for a man to live there
And the king of that country is the fierce green land bear
And there will be no temptation to tarry long there
Ship bumper full
We will hold, we will hold, we will hold, we'll hold, we'll hold, we'll hold, and prepare their mouth to jawadi, of you or none of you.
And the dear land of Krimind, I'll bid you the farewell. I'm bound out for Greenland and ready to sail.
It hopes to find riches in hunting the whale
Farewell, Tarwali, farewell
