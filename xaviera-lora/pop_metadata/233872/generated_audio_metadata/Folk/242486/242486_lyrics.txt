People who hurt people is all around
Always has been
Authorities who wage war with the stroke of a pen
And those who change history'cause they're evil driven men
And I'm racing back through time, I hope it's not too late
Gotta correct the mistakes of yesteryears
I have to change some fate
I wanna stop the sorrow
If I can just race back through time
If I can just race back in time
I'm racing through time
I'm racing through time
When our visionaries fall
Because of invisible guns
Once a vision of hope
Means more broken dreams
If we could go back
We could get back the sun
And I'm racing back through time
I hope it's not too late
Gotta correct the mistakes of yesteryears
I have to change some fate
I wanna stop the sorrow
If I can just race back through time
If I can just race back in time
I'm racing back through time
I'm racing back through time
The ink wasn't dry on the parchment
When my son went to war
And died for someone's cause
My dreams and heart were torn
If I could go back I'd run
To stop the moment
Get back to my son
And I'm racing back through time
I hope it's not too late
Gotta correct the mistakes of yesteryears
I have to change some fate
I wanna stop the sorrow
If I can just race back through time
If I can just race back in time
I'm racing back through time
I'm racing back through time
I'm racing back through time
I'm racing back through time
