Here we go again, tolerate and send, stress to impress
Morals are a mess, humour the thoughts
Counter-sentence of the hundred dollar bills, she's an easy kill
Ego's on the rise, a narcissistic life
Sweet talking guys with sweet honest eyes
The work I made tonight, killer alibis
Superficial wives live in the light
Now I can dive, now I can dive, what a feeling
Now I can die what a feeling
Now I can die what a feeling
Now I can die
This impure life is poison inside
Gotta keep it real and enjoy the ride
It's time to leave this place, say no goodbyes
The world awaits, leave it all behind
Now I can die
Now I can die what a feeling
Now I can die what a feeling
Now I can die what a feeling
Now I can die
Now I can die
Now I can die
Now I can die
Now I can die, now I can die
Now I can die, now I can die
Now I can die, what a feeling
Now I can die, what a feeling
Now I can die, what a feeling
Now I can die
