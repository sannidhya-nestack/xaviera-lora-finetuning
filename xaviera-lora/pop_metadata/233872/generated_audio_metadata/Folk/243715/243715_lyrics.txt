Our greatest battles we fight alone
With heart and soul our fields unknown
Like an enemy by night our troubles seek us out
When we're weak and full of doubt
I believe from dark comes the dawn
I believe you will shine on when all is lost
Tomorrow remains you will rise again
In just one blink
Of God's eyes
We laugh and love
We live and die
But we're just fallen angels stranded on this rock we roam
Trying to find our way back home
I believe from dark comes the dawn
I believe you will shine on when all is lost
Tomorrow remains, you will rise again
When all is black
You can't look back
Our greatest glory's not on how we've never fallen down
But how we get up off the ground
I believe from dark comes the dawn
I believe you will shine on when all is lost
Tomorrow remains, you will rise again
I believe from dark comes the dawn
I believe you will shine on
There's a light timeless and true
And it burns in you
That's what I believe
That's what I believe
I believe from dark comes the dawn
I believe you will shine on with all is lost
Tomorrow remains you will rise again
I believe from dawn comes the dawn
I believe you will shine on
There's a light timeless and true
And it burns in
