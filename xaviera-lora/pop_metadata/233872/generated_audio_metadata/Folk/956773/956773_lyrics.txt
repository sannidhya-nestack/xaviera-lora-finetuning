Purple skies roll over, golden yellow field, golden energy
Red flowers they bleed
To green pasture
Calling in a phase
Who knows how many days
We have left here
Before they turn the page
And midnight draws near
Midnight grows near
The sun is a dancing flame
Sinking into the blackest night
The moon is tin foil falling from its great height
Who knows how many days we have left here
Before they turn the page
And midnight draws near
When midnight draws near
Who knows how many days
We have left here
Before they turn the page
And midnight draws near
And midnight draws near
And midnight
Drove near
At midnight
Drove near
