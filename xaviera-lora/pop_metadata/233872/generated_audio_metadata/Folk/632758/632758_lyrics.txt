Grapes are ripe, colours are bright
I feel my senses are starting to fight
Let me, let me
When we met again, I knew, we're not new
I trust that you and you kiss me
Touched by the light
Coming from your side
Touched by the light
Coming from your side
Jumping in bed
I don't feel safe
When I wake up my days feel dull
Touched by the light coming from your side
Touched by the light coming from your side
Touched by the light
Touched by the light coming from your side
Touched by the light coming from your side
Let me love me, let me love me, let me love me, let, me, let, me
Let me love me, let me love me, let me love me, let, me
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me, love, me, love, me, love, me
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love, me
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love, me, love, me
Let me, let me, let me, let me, let me let me, let me
