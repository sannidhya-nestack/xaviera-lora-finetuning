Here comes the night
There he is misted down
Shadows creeping fast over trees and grass as the light goes out
Moon calling clouds
Great dome over me
Good evening, Mrs. Bloom, would you like to share my room? I need some company
Nerves have broken down
Patients I can't get back
Tell me where this old world's bound
It's off track with darkness coming round
Here comes the night
And I know I won't sleep
Thoughts keeping me awake
Is there nothing I can take to shake this feeling?
My troubled mind
All of this misery
I know there's light somewhere
And someday I'll get there
That I can guarantee
My soul, pull and cramp
Nothing's right, can't relax
Time takes so much time to pass
Nightmare waits just beyond my grasp
Nerves have broken down
Patients I can't get back
Tell me where this old world's bound
It's off track
With darkness coming'round
Here comes the night (here comes the night)
Here comes the night
Here comes the night (here comes the night)
Baby, I know (I know)
Mm-hmm, yeah (mm-mm)
Here comes the night
