Warning lights flashed all around me
Face hard pressed against distant memory windows
We're on this dirt road
What has been missed
Her eyes and ears and mouth I kissed
But if you ask me why I'll never
Leave these rising tides
It's mostly for the way she holds her eyes
Woe has brought me to his place
But who has granted me such grace, iveness
We're on these planes of endless war
To send my legions back for more, ooh
But if you ask me why I'll never
Leave these rising tides
It's mostly for the wish you hold to rise
Mask is this that keeps me hid
What openness would you forbid
Running around a colored sun
Looking for the treasured one, no
In the age of wisdom, with the kingdom come
How could this story come undone so quickly
Will she know me, what will she see that
All my words are meant to be so loving
But if you ask me why I'll never leave these rising tides
It's mostly for the way she holds her eyes
It's mostly in her eyes
