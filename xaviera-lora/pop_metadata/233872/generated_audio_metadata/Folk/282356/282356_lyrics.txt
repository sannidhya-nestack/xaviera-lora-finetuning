Some friends and I in a public house
Was playing dominoes one night
When into the pub a fireman ran his face all chalky white
"What's up?" says Brown, "Have you seen a ghost?"
Or, "Have you seen your Aunt Mariah?"
"Me Aunt Mariah be buggered," says he
The bleeding pub's on fire
And there was Brown upside down
Mopping up with whiskey on the floor
"Booze! Booze !" the fireman cried
As they came a-knocking on the door
Oh, don't let'em in'til it's all drunk up
Somebody shouted, "Mackintry !" (Mackintry!) (Mackintry!) (Mackintry!) (Mackintry!) (Mackintry!) (Mackintry!) (Mackintry!) (Mackintry!) (Mackintry!) (Mackintry!) (Mackintry!) (Mackintry!)
And we all got blue blood, apparently drunk when the old gun cow caught fire
Oh, well says Brown, what a bit of luck, everybody follow me
There's booze in the cellar and the fire's not there, so we'll have a grand old spree
So we all went down after good old Brown, the booze we could not miss
And we hadn't been there ten minutes or more
we were quite like this
(Is it hot in here or is it just me?)
Yes
And there was a loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud
There was a loud, loud, loud, loud, loud
Rockin' a whiskey on the floor
Booze! Booze!
The firemen cried as they came a-knockin' on the door
Oh don't blame me'til it's all drunk up
Somebody's shoutin' "Mackintire"
(Mackintire!)
And we all got blue blind hair, living drunk when the old iron cow caught fire
Then Dean walked over to the pork wine tub and gave it just a few hard knocks
Started taking off his pantaloons like Wises shoes and socks
Oh no, says Brown, that ain't allowed, you can't do that in here
Don't go washing your trousers in the pork wine tub
That's why they make light beer
And there was Brown, upside down, knocking at the whisk in the floor
Booze, booze, the firemen cried as they came a-knocking on the door
Oh, don't let'em in'til it's all drunk up
Somebody shouted, "Mackintyre, Mackintyre !"
And we all got blue-blind, paralytic, drunk
When the old-time cop caught fire
And there was ground upside down
With a bucket of whiskey on the floor
Booze, booze, the firemen cried
As they came a-knocking in the door
Oh, don't let'em in'til it's all drunk up
Somebody shouted, "Mackintyre, Mackintyre !"
And we all got blue-blind, paralytic drunk
When they all come out on fire
