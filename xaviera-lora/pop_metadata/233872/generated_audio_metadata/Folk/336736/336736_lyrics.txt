Sit right here beside me dear
But I'll warn you I've been drinking
I like my water spiked with rye
So I know what you are thinking
When it hits my tongue my day is done
That old familiar feeling
I'll sing my song till the words are wrong
And soon I'll be dreaming
So hold yourself away
Hold yourself away, young girl, hold yourself away
I don't want you feeling like you are stealing
All of my good times away
If you don't mind the drink or the songs
Well, I'm not that bad a company
I've got stories galore and a few moves in store
That might keep you smiling
I've got a twinkle in my eye and a wit sharp and dry
And some might call me handsome
But if songs never end and booze in a fence
You best keep on moving
So haul yourself away
Oh, oh, oh, yourself away, young girl
Oh, oh, oh, yourself away
I don't want you feeling
Like you are stealing
All of my good times away
King Henry had his crown but no son could be found
The land was filled with scandal
And return to the drinking I dare you to thank
To escape all his troubles
And when the time comes and my drinking days are done
You might find me pleasing
But in the meantime I'll sit and drink and rhyme
Like good old Henry
So haul yourself away
Haul yourself away, young girl, haul yourself away
I don't want you feeling like you are stealing
All of my good times away
