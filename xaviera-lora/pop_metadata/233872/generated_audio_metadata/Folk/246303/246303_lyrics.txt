It's a cold and crazy winter
It was a cold and crazy night
And when the wind swept down the mountain
That's when I held you tight
And when I said I love you
That's what I meant to say
But now the ship I came here on is sailing away
Well I wish I had a duffle
To take my love along
So we could share our passion
To some Richard Thompson song
But I will call you every evening
While I'm lying in my birth
And you will hear me on the wavelength
When my cell phone works
There's danger in the ocean
The rocks and ice and sea
But someone's gotta land the crab for the aristocracy
So when sunlight touches down
I will have to say goodbye
And I know you're gonna crumble
Yes, I know you're gonna cry
But when days turn into weeks
Won't you bake some berry scones
For I will need more sweetness
When I come home
