I was born in the sixties with beetles and hippies and Elvis
Saw the great baby boom, put a man on the moon and got jealous
And like a shot from a gun, my third rock from the sun had arrived
Now my bubble lies broken
Since hobble poked open the skies
I'd be the first to admit it
You'd be the first to agree
This life never changes, no it just rearranges
And life goes on and on and over again
Sisters to mothers, brothers to men
Life goes on and on and over and over again
I remember the days when we'd sing purple haze and we'd make love
When AIDS was unheard of and peace was the word of the day
I brought you flowers and we talked for hours before
I baked and I plated, but I guess God needed you more
And I'd be the first to admit it, and you'd be the first to agree
This life never changes, no it just rearranges
And life goes on and on and over again
The sisters to mothers, brothers to men
Life goes on and on and over and over again
Just when you think you've got everything
But you've got the tag out behind the tail
The other, the other shoe may drop
But you can never stop'cause life goes on and on and on
But I don't miss the chance this might be our last dance together
So I'll be the first to admit it
And you'll be the first to agree
This life never changes, no, it just rearranges (it just rearranges)
And life goes on and on and over again
Sisters to brothers, brothers to men
Life goes on and on and over and over again
It over again
The sisters to brothers
Brothers to men life goes on and on
It over and over again
It over again
The sisters to brothers
