Farewell to you, my own true love
For I'm sailing far away
I am bound for Valparaiso
But I know that I'll be back someday
So fare thee well, my own true love
For when I return, united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me
But my darling when I think of thee
I am bound for Valparaiso by way of Old Cape Horn
And I fear that I will rule the day and the hour that I was born
So fare thee well my own true love
For when I return united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me
But my darling when I think of thee
I am bound upon a Yankee sailing ship
Davy Crockett is her name
And Burgess is a captain of her
And I hear that she's a floating chain
So fare thee well, my own true love
For when I return, united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me
But my darling, when I think of thee
'Tis me second passage with old Burgess, and I think I know him well
If a man's a sailor he can get along, if not he's sure in hell
So fare thee well, my own true love
For when I return, united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me
But my darling, when I think of thee
Oh, the sun is on the highward love
And I wish I could remain
For I know it will be a long, long time
Before I see you again
So fare thee well my own true love
For when I return united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me
But my darling when I think of thee
So fare thee well my own true love
For when I return, united we will be (we'll be)
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me
But my darling, when I think of thee
