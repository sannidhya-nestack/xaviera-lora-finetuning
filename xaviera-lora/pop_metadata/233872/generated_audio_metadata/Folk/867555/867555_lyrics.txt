I left my home to take the coin
King Henry's army for to join
A knightly fee I seek to hold
A belt to wear and spurs of gold
Two accolades had King Henry
Just one would be enough for me
So off we marched from keep and town
To win my king a second crown
For God, St. G e and King Henry I brought my men across the sea
Honor and right we're fighting for I'll win my spurs at Agincourt
I brought in train nine armored men And bowmen steady ten by ten
We've taken ship and come to land On Normandy's green earth we stand
A hundred years of war we've known
Our king denied his second throne
We'll beard the lion in his den
And show the worth of Englishmen
For God's sake G e and King Henry
I brought my men across the sea
Honor and right we're fighting for
I'll win my spurs at Agincourt
To Harfleur town we laid the siege
And little could I serve my liege
My men are sick, the rivers swell
How long must we bide here in hell?
Then Holland's men essay the gate
Defend it bravely but too late
Our guns are brought to breach the walls
And by surrender Harfleur falls
For God, Saint G e and King Henry
I brought my men across the sea
Honor and right we're fighting for
I'll win my spurs at Agincourt
King Henry stands in armor clad
And though we fear our hearts are glad
He calls us brothers happy few
I may die my liege but I'll not shame you
At last the French are camped in sight
With battle planned for morning's light
The minstrels sing with all their breath
The priests prepare our souls for death
But defeat I cannot reckon by
A prisoner I'm, I'm meant to die
I've asked iveness from the Lord
So take my soul and bring my sword
For God, Saint G e, and King Henry
I brought my men across the sea
Honor and right we're fighting for
I'll win my spurs at Agincourt
The Duke of York my men will guard
My bowmen in the archer's yard
No man may make it back alive
For each we have, the French have five
The battle's joined, the arrows fly
The French on horse attack hard by
A mighty press, the Duke is down
What price to pay for Henry's crown?
What miracle my eyes have spied
Our valiant archers turned the tide
Before them each a sharpened stave
From charging horse their life to save
The charge falls back on their own ranks
With arrows in their horses' flanks
The wounded mounts run mad with pain
The French line breaks their plans in vain
By English might the French are pressed
King Henry fights like one possessed
The Duke will never rise again
It falls to me to lead our men
With rallied cry our van attacks
The archers join with sword and axe
With banners high we meet the fray
Against all odds we win the day
For God, Saint G e and King Henry
I brought my men across the sea
Honor and right we're fighting for
I'll win my spurs at Agincourt
To London town and songs of praise
In victory we proudly raise
The banner of St. G e's cross
To cries of Deo gratias
But now I ride for my own lands
To serve the King as He commands
To keep the faith He placed in me
With grace and might of chivalry
For God, Saint G e and King Henry
We gained a mighty victory
And I return a squire no more
I won my spurs at Agincourt
