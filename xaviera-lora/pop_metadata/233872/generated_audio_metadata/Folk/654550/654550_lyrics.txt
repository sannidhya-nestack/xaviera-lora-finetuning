Politician, coalition, foreign and malnutrition
Over a three course brunch
Automation, superstition, supersedes the larger vision
Denizens drink, I punch
Uncle Tom, don't Uncle Sam, that ain't your mama
Was the man that only the Quakers know
You can read between the lines, and all that you will ever find
Is don't eat the yellow snow
I like spaghetti
But I don't wanna talk about religion
I like spaghetti
But please don't tell me how to vote, no
I like spaghetti
But I don't wanna hear about your hatred
I like spaghetti
But I don't know, I don't wanna, I don't wanna hear ya
First you brown the meat, then you drain the grease
Mix it with some marinara sauce
Eat some garlic bread, you'll be overfed
Serve it with some greens and vinaigrette
Standing in the welfare line for lectures that you're wasting time
But they told you to be here
Breathing in the rubber tires made to fuel mobile desires
As American as cold beer
Every word it has a place I just don't want them in my face
Your lies will go up in smoke
I pay you to pay a man to pay our special interest plans
I think everything's broke
But I like spaghetti
But I don't wanna talk about religion
I like spaghetti
Please don't tell me how to vote, no
I like spaghetti
But I don't wanna hear about your hatred
I like spaghetti
But I don't know, I don't wanna, I don't wanna hear ya
First you brown the meat, then you drain the grease
Mix it with some marinara sauce
Eat some garlic bread, you'll be overfed
Serve it with some greens and vinaigrette
I like spaghetti
I like spaghetti
