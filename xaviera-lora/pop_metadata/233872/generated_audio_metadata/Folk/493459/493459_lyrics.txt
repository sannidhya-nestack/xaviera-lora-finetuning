Two little girls from the county of Kent
Freed from the shadows of war
Out of the darkness into the sunshine
Free to be children once more
They grow up together, lives together bound
Hands across the garden, streets and towns
We'll kiss and tell, pigtails and inkwells, daisy stems in jam jars
Turned to dates upon roller skates and Friday nights at the Star
Mary met an American, stole her heart away
Jean she fell for a northern boy down from Lincolnshire Way
Old country, new love, lives entwined
Godparents, bridesmaids, best man smiles
Everyone hold on tight they said
Soldiers to brand new brights
Everyone hold on tight they said
We're in for the ride of our lives
Before too long those kids came along and we two would all become friends
We played in the haze of long summer days, we thought that they never would end
Off to the Isle of Sheppey in a singer gazelle
A cold dip and a warm pup on the pebbles and shells
Fun fair reunions, arcade smiles
Hands across the water, oceans wide
Everyone hold on tight, we say
Top of the cart inside
Everyone hold on tight, we say
We're in for the ride of our lives
Will we grow up fast? Memories pass, it's safe on a picture book page
See how they've grown, these kids of our own
Now it's their turn up on the stage
The sadness full of beauty takes my breath away
Wish they knew each other like we did back in the day
Sisters and brothers, hopes and fears
Fathers and mothers, dry the tears
Everyone hold on tight, we say
As they prepare to fly
Everyone hold on tight, we say
Yearning for the ride of your life
I'm not trying to be a hypocrite, I'm just trying to help you out, I'm just trying to help you out, okay?
