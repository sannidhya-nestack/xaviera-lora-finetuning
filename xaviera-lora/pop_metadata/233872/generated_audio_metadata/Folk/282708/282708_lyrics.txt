One night together we brought the house down
One night she said I love you
One night I told her that she had my heart
I do believe it's still true
She laid me down and she kissed me so sweet
The grass was so damp and so cold
When I am with her I feel like a child
When I'm without her I'm old
And I'm in trouble again, my friends
I'm in trouble again
Oh, the trouble with me is I just can't let go
The trouble with her is she can
And I'm in trouble again, my friends
I'm in trouble again
Oh, the trouble with me
The trouble with her is she can
She looked at me and I felt my knees go
I laid my head on her breast
She made me laugh and then she made me cry
I don't know which I liked the best
But I'm in trouble again my friends
I'm in trouble again
Oh, the trouble with me is I just can't let go
The trouble with her is she can
Oh, the trouble with me is I just can't let go
The trouble with her is she can
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
