He sees you when you're sleeping He knows when you're awake
He knows just what you love the most
And that's what he's gonna take
he's the repo man, he's the repo man
You can't run as fast as you can
You can't outrun the repo man
You can't outrun the repo man
You can try to shrink, you can try to be small
The repo man will still come take it all
You can try to be good, do everything just right
The repo man will still come get you in the night
'Cause He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows just what you love the most
And that's what He's gonna take
Don't dare to dance, don't dare to sing
Don't dare to write, don't dare to dream
Don't dare to laugh, don't dare to even breathe
The repo man will never set you free
He feeds on your fear
He thrives on your doubt
If you want any joy in your life
There's only one way out
It's called courage, it's just courage
Take a deep breath
It's called courage, only courage
Take your next step
And when he sees you when you're sleeping
And when he knows when you're awake
And when he knows just what you love the most
That's when you'll have faith
And the repo man, the repo man
He can run as fast as he can
You have dissolved the repo man
You have dissolved the repo man
