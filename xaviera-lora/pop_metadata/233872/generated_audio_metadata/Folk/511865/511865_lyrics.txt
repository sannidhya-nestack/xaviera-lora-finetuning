I'll be your wild maiden if you come out to play
Be your wild maiden today
The morning smells so sweet and good
The dancing dragon flies
A shady tree out in the woods
A perfect place to hide in each other's eyes
And I'll be your wild maiden if you come out to play
Be your wild maiden today
The sunlight flickers through the leaves upon a bed of grass
We can do what no one sees
Time gives up its hold to a moment's chance at last
I'll be your wild maiden if you come out to play
And today, what do you say?
We'll end to the fire (end to the fire)
Path into the air (into the air)
Moving like the water (moving)
For where we dare
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll be your violinator if you come out to play
Be your wild maiden today
The whispers of the forest sky won't tell and will not ask
A dandelion fleeing by is ruled by nature's hand and its written path
I'll be your wild maiden if you come out to play
Be your wild maiden today
Ah
Ooh
Ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
