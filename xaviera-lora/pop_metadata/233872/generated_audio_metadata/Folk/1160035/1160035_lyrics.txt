Shape of the leaves, they're far from the trees
They do what they please, turning golden in time
But we tire needlessly
We're all running on empty
We're sailors of seas
That have frozen in time, in time
Frozen in time
In the sea
Deep in the sea
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sink in the storm
Feels like I'm falling in love
It can't seem to change
All people are strange
But they're playing a game
Where the rules have expired
I'm thinking of someone
Who knows how it's done
But they do it for fun
Making water with fire
With fire
Water with fire
In the sea
Deep in the sea, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I sink in the storm
Feels like I'm falling in love
Sink in the stone, run in the wind
A dick in the dirt, oh
Feels like I'm falling in love
Sink in the storm, whoa
Run in the wind, oh
You're digging that dive, oh
It feels like I'm falling in love
Feels like falling in love
Feels like I'm falling in love for you, you
You, you, you, for you
