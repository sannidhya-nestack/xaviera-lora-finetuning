And sweating it out
And sweating it out for years
Never got easier and it
Hardly seems a shame
Never does grow dark but damned
The lights start to dim
Can you understand?
And there's always time to begin
So we talk, talk, talk
Just to remember the names
And I hold in my heart
The jewels of the being
The inner light will guide you
On through the mainland, only your head ain't low
Pick it up and go, get on your way and try
Not too big gone again, already been gone and now
Oh now it's time to go home
Kick back, toss up your feet, live your life
Kick back, toss up your feet, just the way you like it
So we talk, talk, talk, just to remember the names
That you hold in your heart, the jewels of the being
