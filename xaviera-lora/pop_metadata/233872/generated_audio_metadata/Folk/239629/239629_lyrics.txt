And I don't know where we've been
I don't know where we've been
And I don't know where we've been
But it's been too long
And I don't know what went wrong
Once the cute happy pair
They only sing about in love songs
Maybe just life's
Maybe just life's wear and tear
And I don't know where I've been
Oh, I don't know where I've been
I don't know where I've been
But it's been too long
It's been too long
And I don't know what's up with you, in your mind, you've checked out
Now there's one where there used to be two
More interested to be out and about
And I don't know where you've been
I don't know where you've been
No I don't know where you've been
But it's been too long
It's been too long
So many questions
Along with the pain
Of where we went wrong
When all the days just feel like rain
Can we work it out
Has it been too long
And I don't know where we've been
I don't know where we've been
I don't know where we've been
Cause it's been too long
Yeah, I don't know where we've been
I don't know where we've been
I don't know where we've been
It's been too long
It's been too long
It's been too long
It's been too long
