Sitting in dew drop sunshine
A place to you and frame in my mind
And you are the woman in my dreams
Let's clear less style through darkness
Embrace the beauty that marks us
And you are the woman in my dreams
I love to hear the brightest of blue words
And take a step to what I am looking towards
You are the woman in my dreams
Any other day could have been the day
But my time ends all that I
I never know what to say anyway
They never seen art in motion
And you and I were painting a notion
Lord to be with a woman of my dreams
In my dream, yeah, it's all a dream
You were only a dream
