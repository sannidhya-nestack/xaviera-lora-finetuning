Oh Sally, my love, do I be kissing?
Oh Sally, my dear, do I be cursing?
She smiled and replied
You don't know what you're missing
Oh Sally, my love
I wish I could with you
Oh Sally, my dear
I wish I could let you
She smiled and replied
Sir, I misled you
And if all you young men wear hairs on the mountain
If all you young men wear hairs on the mountain
The day of young girls take guns and go out there
And if all you young men wear black birds and brushes
If all you young men wear black birds and brushes
The damn young girls go beating the bushes
And if all you young men were fish in the water
If all you young men were fish in the water
Would all the young girls on present die that day
For the young men they're given
To frisking and fooling
It's only young men
That frisking and fooling
So leave them alone
And attend to my schooling
