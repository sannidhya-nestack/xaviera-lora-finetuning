I recall a day when we crossed each others way just by design
I had holes in my shoes and in my shirt but you didn't seem to mind
It was so right for us
We couldn't help but make a fuss
And I knew we'd be fine because
I'd hold you like you held me
Right there on the street
You stood your ground and I stood mine
We couldn't stop the words from coming out and taking up all our time
It was so right for us
We couldn't help but make a fuss
And I knew we'd be fine because it hold you like you held me
It was so right for us
We couldn't help but make a fuss
And I knew we'd be fine because
It holds you like you held me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It was so right for us
We couldn't help but make a fuss
And I knew we'd be fine because
It holds you like you held me
It was so right for us, we couldn't help but make a fuss
And I knew we'd be fine because it holds you like you held me
Oh, this is so right for us
We can't ever make a fuss
And I know we'll be fine because
I'm still holding you like you hold me
