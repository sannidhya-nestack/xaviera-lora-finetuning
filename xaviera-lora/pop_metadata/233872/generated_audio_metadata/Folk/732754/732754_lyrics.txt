Black clouds flashing lights
I stare out my window and it's midnight, midnight
Black clouds flashing lights
I stare out my window and it's midnight, midnight
And the clouds they break, they break apart like we did, like we did
Like we did, like we did
And the light it strikes, it strikes a chord deep within where you've been
Where've you been, or where've you been, and I, I will never be the same, be the same, be the same
Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls
Your waves break over me, over me, over me
Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls
Your waves break over me, over me, over me
Rushing winds
They sweep me up, they whisper in my ear
My love, my love, rushing winds, they sweep me up
They whisper in my ear
My love, my love
And the wings they tore, they tore it down
What we build, what we build
What we build, what we build
And the whispers we fade quietly into night
Oh the sound of your voice
I feel I'd et and I
I will never be the same, be the same
Deep call city, in the roar of your waterfalls
Your waves break over me, over me, over me
Deep call city, in the roar of your waterfalls
Your waves break over me, over me
Breathless and paralyzed is how I'm left here
Can't feel the wind without you in it
The storm keeps moving in and I, I look for you again
Can't catch my breath'til you see me
I will never be the same
Be the same
Deep calls to deep
In the roar of your waterfalls
Few waves break over me
Over me, over me
Deep calls to deep
In the roar of your waterfalls
Your waves break over me, over me
I will never be the same
Deep calls to deep
I will never be the same
In the roar of your waterfalls
I will never be the same, deep coast to deep
