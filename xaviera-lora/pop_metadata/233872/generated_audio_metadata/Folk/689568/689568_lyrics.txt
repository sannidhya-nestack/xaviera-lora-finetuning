How can it be that your mind is leaving me?
It's a stranger that I kissed when I came through the door
Why did you leave? Do you even know you're gone?
While the leaves pile on your lawn and they're blowing away
A spark of life resides inside
While you're gone, while you're gone, while you're gone, you're gone
A spark of light resides inside
A spark of life resides inside
While you're gone, while you're gone, while you're gone, you're gone
A spark of light resides inside
Is there a place where the lost sheep go to stay
And the wolves are kept at bay till the shepherds return
Is there a place where the darkness won't creep in
Where the silence breaks the pen and the straw in your bag
A spark of life resides inside
you're home,'til you're home
A spark of light resides inside
A spark of life resides inside
While you're gone,'til you're home
A spark of light resides inside
While you're away
I can sweep your floor each day
I can rake your leaves up high
Should you drop out of the sky
While you're away
I could sort your mail in piles
And I promise not to peek
Through the files you never keep
And I promise not to tell
But there's nothing left to tell
