Grandpa can't go home today, though he's done nothing wrong
Live to love so lyrical that it's ending like a song
Grandma passed away today, and he just can't go home
he can't face the morning there alone
So he walks and smokes and circles outside in the drive
I guess he must be wishing that somehow she was still alive
He mumbles little words and phrases that I can't seem to hear
Intended for other ears
No, he just wants to wake up in the morning
And tell her how he's feeling, feeling in the end
He just longs to hold her, if only just to say goodbye again
Every year since mom was born at night he's held her hand
Now they're saying she's gone, you just can't quite understand
You can't find the strength to just give up and let her go
But then again how does any man just let love go?
The steady light's another cigarette, and he looks up at the stars
And tilts his head as if to say, "I wonder where you are"
And I think he must be crying
By the way he rubs his eyes
And dries his hands on his thighs
No, he just wants to wake up in the morning
Tell her how he's feeling, feeling in the end
He just longs to hold her, if only just to say goodbye again
Grandpa can't go home today, though he's done nothing wrong
Probably stand there smoking in the driveway until the dawn
Grandma passed away today and he can't let it end
None of us can blame him
If he just wants to wake up in the morning
And tell her how he's feeling, feeling in the end
If he just longs to hold her
If only just to say goodbye again
If he just longs to hold her
If only just to say goodbye again
