It's the wedding of the year and the champagne's all but clear
And toasts are ringing out across the hall
And the father of the bride takes his son-in-law aside
Says welcome to the family from us all
Then the bride she kissed the groom and her shudder shook the room
Most men they've been seeing are on the sly
And a man comes in too late says this wedding's gotta wait
I married this same woman in July
A-yippie-aye-oh, a-yippie-aye-ah
They never should have married this morning
A-yippie-aye-oh, A-yippie-aye-ah
They never should have married today
Well you know a fist comes flashing out as the disco lights go out
Chairs and tables flying in a rage
And the air is turning blue made of honour stuck like glue
To the best man in a headlock on stage
And the leader of the band like Titanic but on land
Tries to save the day with a rousing melody
But he gets his words mixed up and you know he's out of luck
He's singing D-I-V-O-R-C-E
Oh yippee aye oh, oh yippee aye
They never should have married this morning
Oh yippee aye oh, oh yippee aye
They never should have married today
No they never should have married
Never should have married
Never should have married today, no way
They never should have married
They never should have married
They never should have married today
I-Y-P-I-E-O (Y-P-I-E-O)
I-Y-P-A (Y-P-A)
I-Y-P-I-E-A (Y-P-I-E-A)
I-Y-P-A (Y-Y-P-A)
I-Y-P-I-E-U (Y-Y)
I-Y-P-I-E-L (Y-Y)
I-Y-P-I-E-O (Y-P-I-E)
I-Y-P-A
Well, the constables in blue shout, "Don't anybody move"
It's time, this fighting's gotta cease
But the bride is taking aim at her husband
What a shame, gets arrested for breaching of the peace
I-M-P-I-O (I-M-P-I-O) I-M-P-A (I-M-P-A) I-M-P-I-O (I-M-P-I-O) I'm I-M-P-A (I'm I-M-P-A)
No, they never should have married
Never should have married
Never should have married today
Well, the groom says to the father of the bride
This has been the very worst day of my life
And I never should have married
Never should have married
Never should have married today, no way
I never should have married
Never should have married
Never should have married today
