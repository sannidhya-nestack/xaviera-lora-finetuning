I'm gonna tell you about John Henry
He was a steel-driving man
Well, he said to his mama on the day that he was born
I'm gonna hammer all over this land, oh yeah
Gonna be a steel driving man
Just a pouring down rain on a Saturday morning sun refused to shine
John Henry was born in a railway shanty way down track from the mine oh lord
Down on the Tennessee line
When he weren't no bigger than a little bitty baby he said to the hiring man
Well I'm a getting too old for a cradle and a rattle and I gotta have a hammer in my hand oh lord
I'm gonna be a hammering man
He said give me a chance and let me work in your mine and I'll show you what I can do
This ain't no mine it's a big big tunnel we're cutting it clean on throat
And thanks to my brand new steam drill here I don't need no help from you
Well he picked up a hammer and he reached for another and he took on one in each hand
With both running left he was swinging and a singing ain't nothing but a natural man oh lord
A natural hammering man
So tell me John Henry what can you do that this steam drill can
Well, I can drive your steel in the blisterin' sun and make every stroke just right
And when you're talkin' guttin', I've just begun and I'll finish it just for spite
I can raise me a ruckus when the work's all done, take my kids out on a Saturday night
"Well you look here boy, if you wanna work for me, you gotta beat my steam drill
We gonna have us a little contest"
So John Henry shouldered up his hammer and the captain fired up the steam drill
And there they met, muscle and metal against the mountain
Try that spike John Henry
Well they worked all day in the big big tunnel and when the work was all done
That drill was down only sixteen feet John Henry had twenty one oh lord
And he said I've just begun
John Henry, you beat my steam drill right enough
But you want wages and it don't
Why you ain't nothing but a machine yourself boy
What you got that it ain't?
Well I got good times and I got my share of troubles everyday
And I got me a wife and kids who care when things don't go my way
And I got me someone way up there who hears me when I pray
And just then the Lord says, "John Henry, I'm gonna call you home
I made you the finest steel drive in all the land
And I see down there, I see you're just wasting your time
And he called John Henry home"
Well they buried him there in the big bend tunnel and the trains go rolling by
You can almost hear his hammer ringing, you can hear the whistle cry, ooh
You can hear the whistle cry
John Henry, John Henry, John Henry
