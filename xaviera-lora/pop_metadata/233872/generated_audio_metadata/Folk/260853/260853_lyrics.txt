And it's all for me grub, hey!
Me jolly, jolly grub, hey, hey!
All gone for beer and tobacco
Well, I spent all me tin near the lassie's drinkin' gin
Far across the western ocean I must wander
Where are me boots? Me noggy, noggy boots?
All gone for beer and tobacco
Well the heels they are worn out and the toes are knocked about
And the soles they're looking out for better weather
And it's all for me grub, hey, me jolly, jolly grub, hey, hey
All gone for beer and tobacco
Well I spent all me tin with the lassies drinking gin
Far across the western ocean I must wander
Oh where is me shirt, me boggy, boggy shirt
All gone for beer and tobacco
Well, the cholera it is wore
And the sneeze they are all tore
And the tails are looking out for better weather
And it's all for me, Grom, hey!
Me jolly, jolly Grom, hey, hey!
All gone for beer and tobacco
Well, I spent all me tin with a lassie's drinking bin
Far across the western ocean I must wander
Where is our ship? Our noggy noggy ship?
All grown from beer and tobacco
Well the masks are all torn down

And I think we're gonna have to steal another
And it's all for me, Grodd (Hey!)
You're jolly, jolly Grodd (Hey, hey!)
All grown from beer and tobacco
Well I spent all me tin with a lassie's drinkin' gin
Far across the western ocean I must wander

And it's all for me grunt, me dolly dolly grunt
All gone for beer and tobacco
Well, I spent all me loot in a house with ill repute
And I think I'll have to go back there tomorrow
But where is me verse, me noggy noggy verse?
All gone for beer and tobacco
Well, the nouns, they're all gone
And the adjectives, so long
And the verbs are looking out for better weather
And it's all for me God, hey
Me dolly, yolly God, hey hey
All gone for beer and tobacco
Well, I spent all me loot in a house of ill repute
And I think I'll have to go back there tomorrow
Well, I'm sick in the head and I haven't been to bed
Since we came ashore with our plunder
I've seen cats and smelly rakes and they're giving me headaches
And I think I'll have to go away off yonder
And it's all for me grunt (hey)
Me jolly, jolly grunt (hey, hey)
All gone for beer and tobacco
Well, I spent all me loot in a house of ill-repute
And I think I'll have to go back there tomorrow
Yes, I think I'll have to go back there tomorrow
Amen
