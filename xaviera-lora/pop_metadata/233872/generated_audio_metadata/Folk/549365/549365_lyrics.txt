Praise the Lord, we call Almighty
Praise to Him for every soul
Praise the Lord for every child born
Through every bell we toll
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord for every mountain
Every valley, every field
For giving us this world to strive in
And for all our wounds He sealed
Praise the Lord
Praise Him, praise Him
Praise the Lord
For every sunrise
And for every sunset too
Praise to Him for the gift of life
And for loving me and you
Praise the Lord
For more than any other thing
We thank with one accord
His iving of things we haven't done
Like helping
Those ignorant
Praise the Lord
Praise Him, Praise Him
Praise the Lord
For every sunrise
And for every sunset, too
Praise to Him for the gift of life
And for loving me and you
Praise the Lord
Praise to Him for the gift of life
And for loving me and you
Praise the Lord
