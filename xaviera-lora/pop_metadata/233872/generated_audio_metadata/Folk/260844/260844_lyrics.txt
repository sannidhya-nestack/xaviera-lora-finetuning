Sailin' down the Baltic where the Rack Mark boys all peel
Cruisin' down the Channel where the steamers never yield
Beatin' down the Biscay where the crew they get no meals
She's the mighty sailing ship, the hers against the seal
Hers against the seal, hers against the seal
She's the mighty sailing ship, the hers against the seal
Rolling in the doldrums where the slightest breeze she'll feel
Tacking in the Tasman where the wind's up on her still
Roaring down the forties, her braces sing like steel
There goes the mighty sailing ship, the hers against the seal
Hers against the seal, hers against the seal
She's the mighty sailing ship, the hers against the seal
Coming down from Labrador with a load of fine and deal
Off to Antelpego where the albatrosses wheel
Running eastward for the Horn, oh hear her ringing squeal
She's the mighty sailing ship, the hers against Cécile
Hers against Cécile, hers against Cécile
She's the mighty sailing ship, the hers against the seal
Cruising Caribbean, comes with a flying fish appeal
Now she's found out, bound for waters her past just times revealed
A ship loads draining in her hold, the bull against she'll feel
She's the mighty sailing ship, the hers against the seal
Hers against the seal, hers against the seal
She's the mighty sailing ship, the hers against the seal
She's run upon the bobtail in the midst a test of steel
She's hard her ground and sawmilk of the rocks have broken her keel
The deck planks of the Duchess, your feet will nevermore feel
She was the mighty sailing ship, the herds against the seal, herds against the seal, herds against the seal
She was the mighty sailing ship, the herds against the seal, herds against the seal, herds against the seal
She was the mighty sailing ship, the herds against the seal
