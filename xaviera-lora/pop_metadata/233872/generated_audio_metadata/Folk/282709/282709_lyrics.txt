Please miss me, I'll be excused
My ego has been bruised
And now it's all deflated
I've been sitting at the back
And I've had three heart attacks
In the time that I've been waiting
And I can't stand this
And I can't take this
Yes, miss, I'd like to contribute
I'm tired of being mute and feeling underrated
I know I've got lots to learn
iveness must be earned instead of just debated
But I don't
And I don't need this
And you don't see me
Heaven, hell, high
And you won't pick me
Don't know why
Pointed hat and painted frown
Or bow down to the nucleus clown
So please miss, don't mean to be rude
I need to be excused and possibly sedated
Seems that I got stuck on you
And then I came unglued
And now we're separated
And I can't stand this
And I can't take this
'Cause you don't see me and held high
And you don't pick me, don't know why
I am smiling upside down
Or bow down to the new class clown
See it's just that I'm not
But I have got this obsession
To learn my lesson and do
Object on you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, no, no
Please miss
Please, I can't stand this
Please miss, I can't take this
Please miss, I don't want this
Please miss, please miss
Ooh yes miss, yes miss, three bags full miss
