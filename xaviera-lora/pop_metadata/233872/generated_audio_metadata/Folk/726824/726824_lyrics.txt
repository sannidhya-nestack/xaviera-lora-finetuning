If you stood beside me would you notice me and smile
Or put your arms around me would you hold me for a while
There are many things a man can do many many things
And if we walked home the same way
Would you be kind to me and spend the time of day
And if our fingers intertwined the way some peoples do
Would you look in my eyes and say you love me true
There are many things a man can do
There are many many things I could do
Especially for you (make me not allow love to die for you)
Especially for you (stop the rain from falling if you ask me to)
Especially for you (I'd do anything you wanted to)
Especially for you
If you remember me I hope it's with a smile
Tugging at my heart strings and laughing for a while
So if you stood beside me it would make me smile
So put your arms around me now and hold me for a while
