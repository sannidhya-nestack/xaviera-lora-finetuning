I was a woman having a little fun
And walked a man with a great big gun
I had to step it up and go
Yes sir, I had to go
I couldn't stay there, I swear I had to step it up and go
So I jumped in the river, tried to get across
Stepped on an alligator, thought it was a horse
Had to step it up and go
Uh huh, I had to go
I couldn't stay there, I swear I had step it up and go
Nickel is nickel, dime is dime
You shake yours, honey, and I shake mine
I gotta step it up and go, uh-huh, I had to go
Well, I couldn't stay there, I swear I had to step it up and go
I'm so glad the world's round like a ball
There's enough pretty women here for us all
I gotta step it up and go, uh huh, I gotta go
But I can't stay here, I fear, I gotta step it up and go
I'm gonna step it up now
