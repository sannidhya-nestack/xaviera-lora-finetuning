Sunday night, try to scrub things bright
Saving the water for the next in line
Radio's throwing up something simple's up
If this is growing up, I'd rather die
Monday morning, the kids are yawning
Dressed in fawn and blue striped ties
Shelter from the storm, safety in a uniform
Double quick into single file
Nice little badges, nice little ties
Nice little blazers too
Nice little half-truths, nice little lies
These are the best days of your life
One day you'll look back and you'll see
We were looking out for you
You'll be telling your kids just like we did
You'll look fine dressed to the nines
In nice little badges, nice little ties
Nice little blazers too
Nice little half-truths, nice little lies
These are the best days of your life
Friday night, try to scrub things bright
Different teams but the same old game
Living for the weekend, going off the deep end
We're all grown still we wear the same
Nice little badges, nice little ties
Nice little blazers too
Nice little half-truths, nice little lies
These are the best days of your life
Nice little badges, nice little ties
Nice little blazers too
Nice little half-truths, nice little lies
These are the best days of your life
These are the best days of your life
These are the best days of your life
Ah, you don't know your bloody bone, you lot!
