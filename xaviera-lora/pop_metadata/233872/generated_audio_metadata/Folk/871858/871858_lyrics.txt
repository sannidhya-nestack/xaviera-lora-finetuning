Blue, why you make me blue?
And what's the matter with you?
Oh, you make me blue
It's true, I still care about you
And after all we've been through
Oh, you make me blue
We keep on lovin'til the love goes wrong
We keep on fightin'til we can't fight on
We keep on talkin', talkin'til we're blue
Ooh, you tore my heart in two
And I don't know what to do
Oh, you make me blue
And I, I don't wanna be without you
For all the things you do
Oh, they make me blue
We keep on loving'til the love goes wrong
We keep on fighting'til it can't fight on
We keep on talking, talking'til we're broke
You think that I'm a rose amongst some thorns
That protect me from pain and hurt and falls
You call us, you're wrong
You, you give me something new
You give me something to lose
And I'm losing you
We keep on loving'til the love goes wrong
We keep on fighting'til I can't fight on
We keep on talking, talking'til we're blown
Yeah, yeah
We keep on loving'til the love goes wrong (I still care about you)
We keep on fighting'til I can't fight on (You've been the one we've been to)
We keep on talking, talking'til we're blown
We keep on loving'til the love goes wrong (You give me something new)
We keep on fighting'til it come out (You give us something to lose)
We keep on talking'til the power goes out (You give me something new)
