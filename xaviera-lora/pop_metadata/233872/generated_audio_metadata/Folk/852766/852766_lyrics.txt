Celebrations a million places a world through happy eyes
Growing faces slightly faded slowly worn with time
Every year time slips on by
So do the pages of our lives
By their
In my picture frame
The story of our lives remains
It's captured in timelessness
Always together and the same
In my picture frame
In my picture frame
Memories on the mantapiece
Tell a story through the years
Of the love we've lost, the love we've found
Pain, laughter and tears
Every face and every place
Brings back otten days
But there
In my picture frame
The story of our lives remains
It's captured in timelessness
Always together and the same
In my picture frame
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-do
Here's to good times together
Always forever
And many more years of the same
And there in my picture frame
The story of our lives remains
It's captured in timelessness
Always together and the same
In my picture frame (in my picture frame)
The story of our love has remained
It's captured in timelessness
Always together and the same
In my picture frame (in my picture frame)
They're my picture frame (in my picture frame)
In my picture frame (in my picture frame)
Always together and the same
In my picture frame
