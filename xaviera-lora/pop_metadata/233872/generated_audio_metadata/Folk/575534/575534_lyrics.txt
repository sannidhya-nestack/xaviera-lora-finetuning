Baby, give me a piece of love, a piece of love, a piece of love
Baby, give me a piece of love to brighten up my day
Baby, give me a great big hug, a great big hug, a great big hug
Baby, give me a great big hug
To brighten up my day
I don't want no bad progression here
Just wanna love you all the year
And there's no use in carrying on
If we're not gonna have fun
So love me now
Baby, please
Baby, give me a great big hug, a great big hug, a great big hug
Baby, give me a great big hug to brighten up my day
Baby, give me a piece of love
A piece of love, a piece of love
Baby give me a piece of love
To brighten up my day
I don't want no bad preparation here
Just wanna love you all the year
And there's no use in carrying on
If we're not gonna have more fun
So love me now
Baby please, baby please, baby, baby, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, baby, baby, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
