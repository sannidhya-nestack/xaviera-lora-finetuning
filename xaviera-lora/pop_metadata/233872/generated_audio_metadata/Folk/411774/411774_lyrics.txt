I don't mind sitting down being all alone
And I don't mind standing up while I turn to stone
And I don't mind wasting time turning into air
And I don't mind'cause in my mind there is no despair
And I don't mind walking next to you
And I don't mind what you're gonna do
And I don't mind being in the room
As long as I got me arms
On your mind
I got me on your mind
I don't mind watching you being torn apart
And I don't mind seeing you with a broken heart
And I don't mind being there
When you go to war
And I don't mind what the hell you are fighting for
And I don't mind walking next to you
And I don't mind what you're gonna do
And I don't mind being in the room
As long as I got me on
On your mind
I got me on your mind
I got me on your mind
