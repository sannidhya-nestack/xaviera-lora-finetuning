Well, I met a woman with scripts upon her knees
She said, "Son, I've been praying and begging, darling, please"
You're down and loud and you make that claim that you're dying, dying
I'm down and loud and I feel the same and I'm trying, trying to find a way
Trying, trying, trying to find a way
Look under your bed
There are no monsters, yeah, anywhere
Oh, look under your bed
There are no monsters anywhere
Well, I met a man with a bullet wrapped up in his hand
He said, "I've gotta make it, do anything I can"
You're down and out and you make that claim that you're dying, dying
I'm down and out and I feel the same and I'm trying, I'm trying to find a way
Trying, trying, trying to find a way
Mmm, look under your bed
There are no monsters, oh, anywhere
Oh, look under your bed
There are no monsters, oh, anywhere
Zombies, they are staring
Leeches, proud of their cringe
Vampires with a lead match
Doused in kerosene
I peel back the pain
Claws start to flash
The drug that it becomes
This road won't bring me down
No, no
This road won't bring me down
No, no, no, no
This road won't bring me down
No, no, no, no
This road won't bring me down
No, no, no, no
This road won't bring me down
