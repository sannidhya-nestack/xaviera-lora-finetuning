Moon child, moon child staring at the sky
Heaven only knows what you're dreaming of tonight
In the skyline, skyline is a fading light
But it seems like the stars they never shine so bright
Moon child, moon child, staring at the sky
Heaven only knows what you're seeing in your mind
In the skyline, skyline, there's a fading light
But it seems like the stars, they never look so right
But it seems like the stars they never shine so bright
