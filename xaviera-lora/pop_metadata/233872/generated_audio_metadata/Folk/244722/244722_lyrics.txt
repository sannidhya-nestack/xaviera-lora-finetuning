Seen a lot of worlds, watched a lot of eyes
Trying to find out what's buried deep inside
Looking for an answer that I already know
But you've always been the one, the one that I love so
The one that I love so
Don't you know, don't you know
I've walked for a million years
Struggled through a million tears
Just to be here with you
Seems everyone else always knew
So why don't you know too, know too?
And when I see your eyes, my world is only you
But you never really see me, no matter what I do
I'm looking for your answer, for something you just don't see
You could be the one, or do you really love me?
Do you really love me?
Don't you know, don't you know
I've walked for a million years
Struggled through a million tears
Just to be here with you
Seems everyone else always knew
So why don't you know too, know too, oh, don't, don't you know
