Here's the tale of a packet, a packet of fame
She sails from New York and the dreadnought's her name
the wild western ocean she's bound for to go
She's the Liverpool packet, oh lord, let her go dairy down
Down, down, down Derry down
Oh, the dreadnought is lying in the River Merseys
Waiting the independents to tow her to sea
Around the rock light where the salt tides do flow
Ground her way in the dreadnought to the westward we'll go
Down, down, down Derry down
Now the dreadnoughts are howling down the wild Irish sea
Her passengers merry and the drink is so free
The sailors like lions walk the decks to and fro (decks to and fro)
Found her way in the dreadnought to the westward we'll go, Derry down (down, down, down, down, down, down)
The dreadnought's a-sailing the Atlantic so wide
Where the high warren seas roll along her black sides
The sail's tautly set for the Red Cross to show
She's the Liverpool packet, oh Lord, let her go
Down, down, down Derry down
Now the dreadnought is sailing by the banks of Newfoundland
Where the water is green and the bottom is sand
The fishes all sing as they swim to and fro
Swim to and fro, swim to and fro
Saying God bless the dreadnought wherever she may go
Down, down, down Derry down
Here's a health to the dreadnought and all her brave crew
To old Captain Samuel and his officers true
You can talk of flash packets, swallowtail and black bars
But the dreadnought's the ship that can out-sail'em all
Derry down, down, down, Derry down
Derry down, down, down, Derry down
