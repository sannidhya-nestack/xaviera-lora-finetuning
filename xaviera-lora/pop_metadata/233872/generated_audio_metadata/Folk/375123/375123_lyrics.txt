I've been working over thirty years and almost drowned in the sweat and tears
When I win that lotto it'll be on the news
And I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'll take my clothes off and put my feet back on
Get the guitar out and sing this song
It'll feel right and it won't be wrong
And I won't go to work no more
I bought some magazines that I don't read
Now I think Publishers Clearing House is looking for me
When they show up it'll be on the news
And I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'll take my clothes off and put my feet back on
Get the guitar out
Sing this song, it'll feel right and it won't be wrong
And I won't go to work no more
The stock market's down and business is slow
The bailouts and Bernie made off with our dough
If I get the pink slip it'll be on the news
And I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'll take my clothes off and put my feet back on
Get the guitar out and sing this song
It'll feel right and it won't be wrong
And I won't go to work no more
Let's take our clothes off and put our feet back on
Get the guitars out and sing this song
It'll feel right and it won't be wrong
And we won't go to work no more
