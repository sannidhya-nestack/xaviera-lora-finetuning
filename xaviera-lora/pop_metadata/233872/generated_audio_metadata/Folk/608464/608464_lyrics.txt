You're my little baby, sitting there so soft and sweet
You're my little darling
Kinda knocked me off my feet
Nothing could ever take the place of you
You bring this crowded mind into view
You're my little love dance
Sway across the balmy moon
You're the walking last chance
Don't you move I'll be home soon
Be home soon
Nothing could ever take the place of you
You take and bring this crowded mind into view
You're my sweetest Mayfair
Brightest sun I've ever seen
You're my kindest memories
And your eyes just take me in, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're my little baby
Reaching out to touch my face
You're my little darling
Won't you dance all over the place
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah
Watch us dance all night long
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
