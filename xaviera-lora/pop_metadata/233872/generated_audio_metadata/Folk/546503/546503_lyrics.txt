They didn't want me listening to rock and roll
They'd sooner have me praying to save my soul
So I went out and bought a dozen records from a friend
A GBH to damned, drove my parents round the bend
Oh they didn't want me hanging round the streets at night
They feared I'd get in trouble
Or end up in a fight
So I went out in the evening
I came back home at ten
They'd be watching television
Or saying their rosary again
Though they didn't want me listening to rock and roll
They'd sooner have me praying to save my soul
My father threatened to throw me out
He didn't have to, I ran
I was fifteen, I promised that I'd never come home again
My rebellion didn't last too long
I got kinda cold outside
After that we didn't talk
And then my father died
Oh, he didn't want me listening to rock and roll
Hey, soon I'll have'em a-prayin' to save my soul
Save my soul
Save my soul
I went off to America
When I was twenty-one
I played the guitar in a country band
About every night it's fun
I haven't been home in a while
One day I'd like to try
To make it home to mother
If only to say "Hi"
Oh, she didn't want me listening to rock and roll
She'd sooner have me prayin' to save my soul
No they didn't want me listenin' to rock and roll
They'd sooner have me prayin' to save my soul
Save my soul
Save my soul
Save my soul
