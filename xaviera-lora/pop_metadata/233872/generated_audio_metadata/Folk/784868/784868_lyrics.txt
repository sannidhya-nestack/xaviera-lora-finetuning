My sun went down when you walked away
Darkness fell on that very day
No morning sight
Just cold dark nights
I messed you up
And broke your soul
You locked your heart
And rightly so
I feel black karma
Raining down on me
Raining down on me
In an overflow
Black rain's coming all over me
Black rain's coming on down
Black rain's coming all over me
Black rain coming on down
Now I'm staring down this lonely road
All I see is a heavy load
Of black karma raining down on me
Raining down on me in an overflow
Black rain's coming all over me
Black rain's coming on down
Black range
Coming all over me
Black range
She's coming on down
Black rain's coming all over me
Black rain's coming on down
Black rain
Coming all over me
Black rain
She's coming on down
Down
She's coming on down
Down, down, down, down
She's coming on down
