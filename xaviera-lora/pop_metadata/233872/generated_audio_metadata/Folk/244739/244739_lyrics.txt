In my life I knew the loneliness
A heart damaged, a soul empty
Holding my emotions so closely
Just trying to pass life's test
Then I saw you
And something inside of me from a place I do not know
It tumbles my heart around and covers me with a special glow
It's just something inside of me
It's just something inside of me
Those big beautiful eyes
You see through my disguise
My knees weaken, the pulse quickens
And I've never been this far, this far before
And I feel my spirit finally soar
And there's something inside me
Fills the soul once empty
I'm making my life complete
Lifting my heart to a different beat
Because of something inside of me
It's just something inside of me
And all through the years, with much joy and even tears
Our heart is repaired, our soul fulfilled
Our little ones to keep us thrilled
And all because you soothed my fears
And there's something inside of me that's stirring so rapidly
And feelings I've never felt is there for all to see
That something inside of me
That something inside of me is you
That something inside of me
That something inside of me is you
Oh it's you, it's you, don't you know it's you?
Mmm, it's you
That something inside me is you
That something inside me is you
