What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear
What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer
Oh what peace we often forfeit
Oh what needless pain we bear
No, because we do not carry everything to God in prayer
Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrow share?
Jesus knows our every weakness
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Are we weak and heavy laden?
Cumbered with the load of care
Precious Savior still our refuge
Take it to the Lord in prayer
I do thy friends, oh
Do thy friends despise forsake thee
Take it to the Lord in prayer
In his arms you'll take and she'll be
Thou wilt find a solace there
What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear
What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer
