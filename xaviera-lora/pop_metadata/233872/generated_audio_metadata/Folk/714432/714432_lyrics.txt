Hey-ho, don't you know we're all Irish in the end?
And if you think that it ain't so, then drink some more, my friend
This guy from Tokyo said there's no Irish from Japan
Just like you were an island but that's where the sameness ends
He told me about the samurai their bloodline so pristine
There's Irish in you all I said
The tea you drink is green
Hey ho don't you know we're all Irish in the end
And if you think that it ain't so then drink some more my friend
My Arizona in-laws say they have no Irish bent
But they've traced direct descendancy to the 16th president
And Lincoln never claimed to be from Ireland or its spawn
But with a beard like he was wearing
He must have been a leprechaun
Hey ho, don't you know we're all Irish in the end
And if you think that it ain't so, then drink some more my friend
A man in line for the lottery stopped me and made his case
He's got no Irish blood he said his DNA was traced
Back to deepest Africa his people lived on twigs
Just then he scratched and won the pool and did an Irish jig
Hey ho, don't you know we're all Irish in the end
And if you think that it ain't so, then drink some more my friend
Hey ho, don't you know we're all Irish in the end
And if you think that it ain't so, then drink some more my friend
Yeah, if you think that it ain't so, then drink some more my friend
