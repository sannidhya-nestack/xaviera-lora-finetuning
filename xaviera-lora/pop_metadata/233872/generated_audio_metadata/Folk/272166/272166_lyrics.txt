Long before I chose a path for me
So many doors I would look and explore
I lived in my dreams and now a glass full of scent
That's when I had God's gift in my hand
Suddenly a southern breeze
Tries to wake me from this dream
For regrets been my companion on this road I chose alone, far beyond
My childhood ways reach for stars
They disappear by day
Had what it takes
But didn't like what I made when I had
God's gift in my hand, I pushed and pulled
Tried to fix mistakes, my soul is old
And I've lost my way, I've packed up my pride
But still I don't understand, what did I do?
With the gift that I had
A southern breeze tries to wake me
From this deep constant pain
Full regret's been my companion
On this road I chose to go
I sit here in silence
Memories still haunting me
My peaceful heart has been violent
Won't you set me free, set me free
A southern breeze finally wakes me
I can find my way back home
I can drink my pain and swallow
With new hope I have inside
Letting go is my redemption
I know I'm not alone
I'm not alone
