In the year of our Lord, fifteen hundred and six
We set sail from the coal-bale cork
We were sailing away with our cargo of bricks
For that grand city hall down in York
An elegant crown she was rigged for and at
And how the trade winds drove her
She had twenty-three masks and she stood several blasts
And they called her the Irish Grover
So fare thee well my pretty little girl
For we are bound away
Fare thee well, my pretty little girl, for we are bound away
There was Bonnie McGee from the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was Donnie McGurk who was scared stiff of work
And the chap from Wesley, named Malone
There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
And Fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
And a man, Mick McCann, from the banks of the Van
Was the skipper of the Irish Rover
So fare thee well my pretty little girl
For we are bound away
Fare thee well my pretty little girl
For we are bound away
We had one million bags of the best LIGO rags
We had two million barrels of bone (human femurs)
We had three million bales of old mani-goat's tails
We had four million barrels of stone
We had five million hogs, six million dogs
Seven million barrels of porter
We had eight million signs of old blind horses hides
In the hole of the Irish Rover
So fare thee well my pretty little girl
For we are bound away
Fare thee well, my pretty little girl, for we are bound away
We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And the ship lost its way in a fog
And the whole of the crew was reduced down to two
myself and the captain's all gone (Save the dog!)
Then the ship struck a rock
Lord what a shock, we nearly tumbled over
We spun nine times around
And that poor old dog was drowned
I'm the last of the Irish Rover
So fare thee well my pretty little girl
For we are bound away
Fare thee well my pretty little girl
For we are bounding men
