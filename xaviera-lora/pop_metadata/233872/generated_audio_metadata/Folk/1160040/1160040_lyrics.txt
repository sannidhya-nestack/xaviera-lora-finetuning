TV, turn it off, taxi
Turn it up
Boxy, powder puff
Back straight
This tips and up
Now they're opening the door (now they're opening the door)
Though there's nothing here to see
I feel
Every eye on me
I stop running when I walk
I stop speaking when I talk
I feel
I hear them listening
I see them vanishing
You're not a falling star
You've fallen much too far
Crawling up the stairs
You've fallen down
You're just a neon star
Flashlights

Fictional affairs
Crimson cheeks ablaze
I've been here before, trapped all
Are you falling down the stairs?
Are you crawling on your knees?
Let's see
With some hide and seek
If they like it when you lie (If they like it when you cry)
Will they notice when you die?
We'll see
I hear them listening
I see them vanishing
It's not who, but what you know
The wind might change, the wind might blow the world from afar
You're just a neon star
Flashlight freeze (I'm fallin' low)
Fallin' down the stairs
Flashlight freeze (I'm fallin' low), you're fallin' down the stairs
You're fallin' down the stairs (I'm fallin' low)
You're fallin' down the stairs (I'm fallin' low)
And I'm falling down, falling down, falling down, falling down, I'm falling
Oh, and I'm falling
Yeah, this is me, I'm falling
Yeah, I guess I never thought it
Yeah, I guess I never thought it
Yeah, I guess I never thought it
