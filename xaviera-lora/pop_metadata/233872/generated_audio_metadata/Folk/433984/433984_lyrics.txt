We're going home
On the Hammersmith and City line
We're going home
On the Hammersmith and City line, we're going home
On the Hammersmith and City line, well it's taken so long
I know we're gonna get home
I don't wanna ride the Central or ride the Jubilee
Hammersmith and the City Line
That's the one for me
I may jump on the District
And change at all days
I think I might sit tight tonight
While I've still got this seat
We're going home
On the Hammersmith and City Line
We're going home
On the Hammersmith and City Line
We're going home
On the Hammersmith and City line
Well it's taken so long (so long)
I know we're gonna get home
(I'm not going anywhere)
I came down on the main line, changed at Paddington
Got drunk in the station bar, now I'm at Farringdon
I passed by King's Cross station, so I know I'm traveling east
Clock ain't gonna be the last stop
So I better not fall asleep
We're going home
On the Hammersmith and City Line
We're going home
On the Hammersmith and City Line
We're going home
On the Hammersmith and City Line
Well it's taken so long (so long)
I know we're gonna get home
Taken so long (so long)
I know we're gonna get home
