Do your relatives call you frequently?
Would you like me to keep you company?
Mrs. Nielsen, I don't like to see you alone
Would you like some coffee with your cream?
Was your husband nice or was he mean?
Did he buy you fancy diamond rings?
Hi, ya ya, ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
La la la la la la la la
Mrs. Neilson
La da ya da da da
La da da da ya da
How do you wish to dwell on days of old?
Tell me lovely stories, history sold
In the day when the boys respected girls
And while you're looking back into your past
I can see there's something you regret
It wasn't him you loved
But was he all you thought you'd get?

Did you go to Sunday school?
Lived by all the golden rules
Too bad there couldn't be more people like you
And while you're laughing I will cry
Seeking things on high
I wish that I could make life simple like you do
