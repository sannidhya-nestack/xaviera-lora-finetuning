All I needed was a moment in time
I could see there was love in your eyes
Showing me the way to your heart
A hidden love in such a perfect disguise
I've been searching for you all my life
You were there
All the time
I don't know why
It took so long
For me to realize
I don't know why
I've been so blind
To the truth
I never believed love would ever find me
Till I found you
Girl you turned my world upside down
With a word you turned me inside out
I somehow knew that you would
I found love with my best friend
Getting to know you over again never knew
It could be this good
I don't know why it took so long for me to realize
I don't know why I've been so blind to the truth
I never believed
Love would ever find me
Till I found you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Till I found you
Till I found you, oh, yeah
Can you believe after all these years
It was you, it was always you
Can you believe after all these years
You got me and I got you
I don't know why it took so long for me to realize
I don't know why I've been so blind to the truth
