All the right moves and necessary poses
Praying to the stars, looking down their noses
They're as right as rain, sunshine, drenchy pain
Here it comes again like the last time
All the right words and correct opinions
Pennies on the plates turning into millions
They're as right as rain
Sunshine, drenching pain
See them born again like the last time
So high and dry
The rain falls down upon our heads
We're all wet
We haven't been saved yet
A skin full of bitter and a sweet dream
Lapdogs howling in your slipstream
Boring God
All the right things in you to make you feel whole
Bring it to your knees, peeping through the keyhole
There is right as rain (when the sun shines)
Sunshine, drenching pain (when the sun shines)
See us born again like the last time
So high and dry, the rain falls down upon our heads
We're all wet, we haven't been saved yet
The skin full of bitter and a sweet dream
Lapdogs howling in this slipstream
Pouring God, pouring God
We're pouring God
All the right moves
Necessary poses
Spraying to the stars
Looking down their noses
They're as right as rain
