I like to swim in summer
And I like to eat ice cream
I like to ride my bike
Down by that winding stream
And when the fun is over
And when the playing is through
I'd like to be your friend
I'd like to be with you
I like to fly a kite
And I like to climb on rocks
I like to wear no shoes
And I like to wear no socks
And when it's stormy and raining
And I can't go outside
I like to read a book, then I feel satisfied
I like to ride a horse
And I like to ride in boats
I like to climb in trees
And watch all the clouds just float
And when the day is over
And darkness falls through the trees
I like to go to sleep
I like to be with me
