In Dublin's fair city
Where the girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
She wheels a wheelbarrow
Through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and muscles
Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh, crying cockles and mussels
Alive, alive, oh
She was a fishmonger but short was no wonder
For so were her father and mother before
And they both wheeled their barrel through streets
Broad and narrow, crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o
Alive, alive-o, alive, alive-o
Crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-O
She died of a fever, no one could save her
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
But her ghost wheels her barrel through streets
Broad and narrow, crying cockles and mussels
Alive, alive, oh, alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh, crying cockles and mussels
Alive, alive, oh, alive, alive oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying cockles and mussels
Alive, alive
