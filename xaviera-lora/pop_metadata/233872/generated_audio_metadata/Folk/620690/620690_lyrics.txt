People look for phrases to live their life on by
People look for traces of reasons to try
People don't you see?
So conveniently
Soaked inside this state of mind
We dream our life away
We do it every day
And from time to time
We close our eyes
We're so oblivious
People feel protected
With passwords and keys they leave behind
People are isolated
While we lose our soul in a digital mine
People don't you see, so conveniently
We're soaked inside the state of mind
We dream our life away
We do it every day
And from time to time
We close our eyes
We're so oblivious
People
Never listen
They wait and wait and wait
To say a word
People always say things
That the consequences of which
They can't afford
People, don't you see, so conveniently
We're soaked inside the state of mind
We dream our life away
And we do it every day
And from time to time
We close our eyes
We're so oblivion
