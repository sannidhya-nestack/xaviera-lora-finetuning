Loving you ain't hard
Loving you ain't hard
Loving you, oh, loving you ain't hard
I bring home the bacon
You spend it like it's all yours
And when it's supper time, you're just awakened
I can't take it, I'm on all fours
Oh, loving you ain't hard
Loving you ain't hard
Loving you, oh, loving you ain't hard
You got the money for your high maintenance
But I'm tired of all these creaky doors
I gotta use duct tape just to hold up our fence
The ship's going down, I'm looking for the oars
Oh, but loving you ain't hard
Loving you ain't hard
Loving you, oh, loving you ain't hard
Sweetheart, you're driving me crazy
I work so hard, my back's always achin'
Dishes and laundry, can you be any more lazy?
Gosh girl, there's no more for the taking
Come on now
Lovin' you ain't hard
Lovin' you ain't hard
Lovin' you, oh, lovin' you
Lovin' you ain't hard
Lovin' you ain't hard
Lovin' you, oh, lovin' you ain't hard
