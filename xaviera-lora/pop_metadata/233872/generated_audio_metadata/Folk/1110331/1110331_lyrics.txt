Woman, you are like a hurricane
Ripping up my heart and tossing it
Tossing it all about like a hurricane
Spinning all around again and again
Until I just check out
you're a hurricane
Mm-mm-mm
you're a hurricane
You were strong-willed from the start
Hell hath no fury compared to you
Breezing into a room full of flare
Didn't really care'til I saw that stare
Until I saw that stare
Woman, you are like a hurricane
Ripping up my heart and tossing it
Tossing it all about like a hurricane
Spinning all around again and again
Until I just check out
you're a hurricane
Mm-mm-mm
you're a hurricane
Been quite the journey with you
I'm hanging on for dear life
Seem to miss all of love's little cues
Your temperature cuts like a knife
Cuts me like a knife
Woman, you are like a hurricane
Ripping up my heart and tossing it
Tossing it all about like a hurricane
Spinning all around again and again
Until I just check out
Cause you're a hurricane
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Cause you're a hurricane
Can't see this love going many years
Can't pretend hard to see through my tears
I wanna be here but you keep blowing me away
Your force is too strong I can't stay
Your force is too strong I can't stay
Woman, you are like a hurricane
Ripping up my heart and tossing it
Tossing it all about like a hurricane
Spinning all around again and again
Until I just check out cause you're a hurricane
Woman you are like a hurricane
Ripping up my heart and tossing it
Tossing it all about like a hurricane
Spinning all around again and again
Until I just check out'cause you're a hurricane
Girl, you're like a hurricane, oh yeah
Like a hurricane
