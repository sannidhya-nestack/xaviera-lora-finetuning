I was born in'44
I don't wanna see no more
Screw that man and that Third Reich
No more deals for war tonight
I was born in'63
Oh, what has become of me
Big fat house and gasless car
I'll be at the local bar
I was born in'92
What the hell is wrong with you
Fifteen minutes ain't enough
Can we ever get enough
I just died the day before
I don't wanna see no more
Biochem's across the shore
Brings me back to 44
Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace.
