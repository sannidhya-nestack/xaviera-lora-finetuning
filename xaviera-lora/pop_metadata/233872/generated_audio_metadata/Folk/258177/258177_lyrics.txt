Love, oh my love, good to see you again
I was wondering when you would come stop in
I've waited for what seems like months upon end
And you come with a grey face and tears again
It's okay to cry, there's a season and time
But winter is over and spring is alive
My love I won't fault you if you smile today
I'll be smiling too love it's okay
It's okay to laugh and to skip and to dance
And it's alright to exchange a flirtatious glance
Feel free to fall in love it's okay to do
Just remember I will always
Me with you
Thanks for the talk
Thanks for loving me still
Don't worry, I know that you always will
Your skin looks so soft
And your cheeks slightly flush
Oh, you're leaving so soon
Why such a rush?
Rush off with tear drops, kissing the ground
Deep is your crying, it carries the sound
Of a heart that is mourning the loss of one dear
Don't stop your life just because I'm not here
I held your heart in the palm of my hand
I never thought I would let go
But sometimes things happen that no one can change
It's the sad solemn song of the stone
The song of the stone
The song of the stone
You can leave me roses and poems and tears
Place them by the stone and waste all your years
This lesson my precious I want you to know
It's time to move on
It hurts but please go
Please go
It's okay to laugh and to skip and to dance
And it's alright to exchange a flirtatious glance
Feel free to fall in love, it's okay to do
Just remember I will always be with you
It's okay to laugh and to skip and to dance
It's alright to exchange a flirtatious glance
Feel free to fall in love, it's okay to do
Just remember I will always be with you
Skip and dance, dance, dance, dance my love, dance
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
Oh beauty dance, dance, dance
Dance beauty dance
Oh la la la la la la la la la la
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
