Come and ride with me on the mountain train
Watch the world go by from our window pane
Rolling nice and easy in the misty rain
Come and ride with me on the mountain train
I've missed you more than you'll ever know
Your gentle words and your hair like snow
Shuffling cards and dealing aces
Paid in scenes of pretty places
Come and ride with me on the mountain train
Watch the world go by from our window pane
Rolling nice and easy in the misty rain
Come and ride with me on the mountain train
Pull a penny out of my ear
Mr. Magic Man, make it disappear
A knee-high grape and some butter, rum, and a pack of juicy fruit, chew and gum
Come and ride with me on the mountain train
Watch the world go by from our window pane
Rollin' nice and easy in the misty rain
Come and ride with me on the mountain train
Pumpernickel and pimento cheese
An open window and a country breeze
Smoke as sweet as a cherry peel
Climbing up to Asheville on stairs of steel
Come and ride with me on the mountain train
Watch the world go by from my window pane
Rolling nice and easy in the misty rain
Come and ride with me on the mountain train
Heroes from our childhood days
From Dizzy Dean to Willie Mays
Rounding third and heading home
With some real cream and a pocket comb
Come and ride with me on the mountain train
Watch the world go by from our window pane
Rollin' nice and easy in the misty rain
Come and ride with me on the mountain train
