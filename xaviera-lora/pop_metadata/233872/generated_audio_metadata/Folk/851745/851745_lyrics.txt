Hush now, lonely angel
Look up at the starlight in the skies
Hush now
Lonely angel
Never wipe the stardust from your eyes
Lonesome bluebird
Never leave my side
Don't know how I would collect
The nectar of your love
Lovely bluebird, never leave me behind
I cannot walk this path alone
Speak now, little rosebud
Let the forest hear your deepest thoughts
Speak now, little rosebud
Let the oceans carry all your words
Lonesome raven, globe me in another
I dare not walk this path all alone, some raven
Gift me with your sight
So the darkness lifts us all
And when they say it's far too cold to go away
To lands otten in the snow
You'll wrap up nice and warm
And cozy for the journey of your life
You'll never turn around in dreamland
Lonesome Raven, cloak me in the night
I dare not walk this path all alone
Lonesome Raven, gift me with your sight
So the darkness leaves us all
