You've taken hold, you've taken me
You take enough to put the flame out inside me
You take it all
You've taken me
You take enough to put the flame out inside me
You take it all
You've taken off to put the flame out inside me
You've taken off, you've taken me
You've taken off to put the flame out inside me
