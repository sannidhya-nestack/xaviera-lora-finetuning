Oh, too long
Could it quite have been this way?
Oh, how I hate my fate
Could it quite have been this way?
Could it quite have been this way?
Oh, I'm here, I'm here
Oh, don't leave my feet
Could they quite have been this way?
I shall miss you, love
Oh, don't leave my feet
Oh, don't go
Oh, don't go, don't go, don't go
Oh, don't go, don't go, oh, don't go
Oh, don't go, don't go, don't go
Oh, don't go
( ive me)
(I shall be so alone)
( ive me)
