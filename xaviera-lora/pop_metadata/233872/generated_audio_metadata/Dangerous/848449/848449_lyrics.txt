Roger.
34-1, this is 34, come in.
For you and Roger, the battery's subject 318 East 3rd Street.
Over to you.
Slots to the party attendance of the people of the white van unknown license of the female hispanic.
Diamonds on my neck, gold in my grill and I'm ridin' with the tech
Holla at the plug cause it gotta be finesse
Ain't nothin' left for less so I gotta be the best
It's a violent life, you can live to a hundred, you could die tonight
Probably gettin' out of night, yeah, look what I let my man drive tonight
Better than any man trying to say something
Better be safe, better not say nothing
Now I'm stuntin' like a big time mother
Boys startin' from the bottom like Drake, I'm a big flyer
(Married Queen, 27-11, Married Queen, 27, come here)
(What?)
(27, our battery's suspect is at 318 East 3rd Street)
(Is that related to your call or is it one different petroleum?)
I am a killer, I am a beast, murder the track, cannot compete
