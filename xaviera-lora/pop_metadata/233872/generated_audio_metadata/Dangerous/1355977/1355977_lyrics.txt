Oh, oh, oh
Marble halls in the dying light
Echo the hymns of the final night
The golden dome bleeds crimson tears
As empire falls through a thousand spears
Cross and crescent, flame and steel
The fate of kings, the stars
Under the shadow of Constantine's sun
Walls may crumble but the spirit won't run
Through ash and ruin Byzantium
Mement's thunder shakes the ground
The city screams, no angels found
Icons burn yet prayers remain
Etched in the smoke, eternal flame
From Heia's dome to the blood stained sea
The ghosts still sing in mourn
Under the shadow of Constantine's sun
Walls may crumble but the spirit won't run
Through ash and ruin, Byzantium
Navaroma fades from time
Faith and fury intertwine
Empires die but their songs remain
In the wind that whispers every name
Veil of Byzantium, crown of fire, kingdom undone
Rise through the ages, never gone
Eternal veil, Byzantium
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
La-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da-da-da
