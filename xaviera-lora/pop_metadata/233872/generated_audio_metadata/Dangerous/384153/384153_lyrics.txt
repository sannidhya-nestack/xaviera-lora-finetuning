I am
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I am love
I am love burning
I am love burning
In your heart
Burning in your heart
I am love
Burning in your heart
In your heart
You are the spark before the flame
You are the thought before the name
You are the love that makes me whole
You are the home of every soul
You are the one
Light, burn brighter
Flames rise higher
Consume in your holy light
Your sacred fire
I am the home of the living
So, I am the one
