A stray in this world, it's nice to not belong
American dream was a nightmare all along
Everything I don't end up owning, me I know
Nine to five, I'd rather die than be a drone
One way out today
Angels lead the stray
Please God, blood that fades
Lost boys found a way
Can't live the attic life, live to crave
Nothing left to focus on but substance and pain
Get a stable job and pay to be a slave
I'll take my chances, escape my own way
One way out today
Angels lead the stray
Please God, blind the face
Lost boys found a way
Love's a curse, it's the weakness in my soul
Insecurities, infidelities control
Nothing lasts, only broken bones
Now anywhere I go, I go alone
One way out today
Angels lead the stray
Please God, blind the faith
Lost boys found a way
Lost boys found a way
Lost boys found a way
Lost boys found a way
