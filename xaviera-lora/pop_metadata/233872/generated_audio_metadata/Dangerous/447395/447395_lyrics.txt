The world is a rest function, it also becomes a world of peace and rest function.
(Rest in peace, take heart)
(Be good, be kind, be kind to me)
(Be good, be kind, be kind to me)
It comes with a pull of desperation
And they've been called out to the ground below
To the ground to meet him
To the ground to meet him
