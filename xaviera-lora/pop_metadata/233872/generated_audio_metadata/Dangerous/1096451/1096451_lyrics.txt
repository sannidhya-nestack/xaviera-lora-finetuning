How big is your body?
Evil baby, I'm gonna fuck these soul bags in the super
Your soul is mine
Stupidity forever
It's gonna be forever
It's time to party
Shield, blood and hand
I'm stuck in here forever
Your soul is mine
It's time to party
Make sure to tip your bartender
Make sure to tip your waitress
And tip your fucking DJ
Unstoppable force, self-enrichment, self-enlightenment
