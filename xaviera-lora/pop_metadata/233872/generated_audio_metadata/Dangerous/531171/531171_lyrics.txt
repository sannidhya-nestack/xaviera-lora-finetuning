Last call, one last chance
For the wicked and bold
Will never grow old
Last dance
One last romance to hell with
Demands to hell with them all
Night, send us away on our last flight
Carry us home, oh light
Show us the way on this last night
Carry us home
Time changes and rearranges the features of faces
We've all lost our graces, we dwell in our past
'Cause memories last
We live and we dream
We float with the stream
Oh night
Send us away on our last flight
Carry us home
Oh light
Show us the way on this last night
Carry us home
Oh night, send us away on our last flight
Carry us home
Oh light, show us the way on this last night
Carry us home
