Let it out, let it out
Let it out, let it out
Let it out, let it out
Let it out, get it out
Let it out, let it out, let it out, let it out
Let it out, let it out
Let it out, let it out
I've got a feeling it's burning inside of me
It's like a drug, a social anxiety
I've got no life, what lies in front of me?
I pull the trigger and something inside of me
