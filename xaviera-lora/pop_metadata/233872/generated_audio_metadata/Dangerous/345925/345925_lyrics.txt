Is this the dagger which I see before me?
The handle toward my hand?
Come, let me clutch thee.
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not fatal vision, sensible to feeling as to sight?
Or art thou but a dagger of the mind?
A false creation proceeding from the heat-oppress'd brain.
I see thee yet, in form as palpable as this which now I draw.
Thou marshall'st me in a way that I was doling, and such an instrument I was to yours.
Mine eyes have made the fools of the other senses, or elseworth all the rest.
I see thee still, and on thy blade and dungeon,
Counts of blood which was not so before.
There's no such thing.
It is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes.
Now, o'er the one half world, nature seems dead.
And wicked dreams abuse the curtain's sleep
Witchcraft celebrates pale Hecate's offerings
And withered murder, alarmed by his sentinel, the wolf
Whose howls his want, thus with his stealthy pace
With Tarquin's ravishing strides
Towards his design moves like a ghost
Thou sure and firm said earth, hear not my steps
Which way they walk for fear thy very stones break in my whereabout
And take the present horror from the time which now soothes with it
Whilst I shred he lives, words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives
The bell invites me, hear it not Duncan, For it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Questa è la profezia, sarai re
Ma senza dinastia scaccia via
Quell'antica amicizia che incatena la tua anima
Al vecchio re di Scozia
That which hath made them drunk and made me bold
What of the quaintest of men that yielded me fire?
Hark! peace!'twas the owl that shrieked
The fatal down-run which gives the sterns good-night
Peace about it, the doors are open
And the serendipit grooms mock their charge with snores
To contend upon them when they little die?
Alack, I'm afraid they have awaked and'tis not done.
It tempteth not the deed that founds us. Hark!
I laid their daggers ready for bloodless.
Had he not resembled my father as he slept, I have done it.
My husband!
I have done the deed to trouble you no more.
Has I just said it? (I have)
Who lies in the second chamber? (Don't be a fool)
Series version
Come un fuoco l'ambizione nasce in te
L'inebriante sensazione è la voglia di potere che
Ti porterà ad inaridi dell'arte dell'umana bontà
Dimmi, vecchio re, se già conosci il tuo destino
È per questo che io sono sempre a te vicino
Guarda lei è qui, l'ha accompagnata fino a notte
Non mi ha della dama nel che ti porta via con sé
This is a sorry sight (a foolish thought to say a sorry sight)
There's one to laugh and sleep, and one to cry (murder)
That they didn't wake each other, I stood and heard them
But they didn't say their names
And the rest of'em get to sleep (they're too large together)
One cried, "God bless us" and "Amen" in the other
As they perceived me with these hangman's hands
Listening their fear, I could not say "Amen"
When they did say, "God bless us" (seemingly not to sleep)
Then wherefore could I not pronounce "Amen"?
I had most need of blessing, and "Amen" stuck in my throat
Già sei lei (magari le sue mani sono spargheri)
Però è così diverso essere un re (c'è chi ti pulirà in massacche)
Che nel suo animo è già pazzo, è stato inutile (chi m'arriverrà mai a tardi per capire)
Raggiungere una falsa luce, se alla fine la tua anima (mi sembra mangiare dal tuo stesso vento)
Non avrà più pace
These deeds must not be thought after these ways, so it will make us mad
Sleep, but no more, my death does murder sleep
The innocent sleep, sleep that nips up the rattlesleep of care
The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath
Balm of hurt minds, great riches second cause
Chief nourishment and life's peace (what do you mean?)
Still it cried sleep, no more to all arms
Gods have murdered sleep
And therefore, Cawdor shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more.
Why let them hide? Why, worthy fellow, if you are bent on over-strengthening things so brain-sickly of things, then go, get some water and wash this filthy witness from your hand.
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
They must lie there, go in your carriage, and smear the filthy grooms with blood.
I couldn't no more. I'm afraid to think what I've done. Look what I've done. I did not...
Then infer my purpose.
Give me the dagger.
Sleeping in the dead of us as pictures, in the eye of childhood that fears a painted devil?
If you do bleed, I'll gild the faces of the grooms with oil.
Dimmi vecchio re, qual è l'essenza di questo figlio?
Spiegami perché io non l'ho mai mai conosciuta
Guarda dentro me, capisco, so tanto ora
Sarai sempre qui con me, l'ombra della dama nera
When's that mocking? I'll listen with me whenever it noise appalls me. It's the port-of-hands of the year. I pluck out my nose.
I will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood keen from my hand
Now this my hand will rather the multitude of the seas incarnate I
Make him green or red
My hands are of your color, but I shame to wear a heart so white.
May our Nogid and some of their greed retire we to our chamber.
A little water clears us of this deed, how good it is then.
Your constancy has left you unattended.
Oh Nogid, get on your tight-calf, this occasion call us and show us to be watchers.
Be not lost so poorly in your thoughts.
To know my deed, to a peasant know myself.
Wake Duncan with thy knocking, I will thou court.
I'm the son of a gun, this is the best place I can leave you.
I'm the son of a gun, this is the best place I can leave you.
Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who is there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there! Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Who is there?
All are going to hear, that is our voice, in the east, the south, and the central.
Our voice will be real, we will hear it again, and again soon.
We will kick off the fog lamp.
