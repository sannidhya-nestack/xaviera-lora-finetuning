Are we alone in the universe or are we not?
In either case the idea is quite staggering
(You're a ghost)
Are we alone in the universe or are we not?
In either case the idea is quite staggering
I'll be there.
(I need a girl, I need a girl, I need a girl, I need a girl)
(I need a girl, I need a girl, I need a girl, I need a girl)
The soul
The soul
I don't need it, I don't need it, I don't need it
Are we alone in the universe or are we not?
In either case the idea is quite staggering
