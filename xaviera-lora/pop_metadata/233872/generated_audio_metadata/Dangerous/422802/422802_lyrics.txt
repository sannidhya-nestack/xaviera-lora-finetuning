When I wake up coughing confused
And I reach for a beer, for a pill, for a smoke
When the sun is a viper and the curtains are shone
Baby, I gotta leave you
Before I end up losing my mind
Well it's just me
It's not you
Johnny, Johnny is a tranny
He lives out on the south side, the south side of town
Well everything he does is heaven
Come on and dance like the devil is the leader of a country that is ruled by the wealth of few
And the armies of the angels got the rifles pointed at you and they're coming down to show you the truth
I'm leaving the Motel Chablis
I gotta leave the past behind
To see in front of me
I'm leaving the Motel Chablis
Well I opened up my eyes
The future's all I see
But I'm leaving the woods as I leave
