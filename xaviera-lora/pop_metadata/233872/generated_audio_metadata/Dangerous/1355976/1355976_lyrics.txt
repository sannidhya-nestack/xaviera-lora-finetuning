From the cradle of dawn he came
A shadow bound to flame
The crown of suns upon his brow
No man could halt him now
Across the desert's burning breath
He carved his path through death
Empires melt, the heavens turn
The stars themselves had burned
Through storm and stone his name was cast
A dream too bright to last
For every throne he claimed in fire
He fed his soul to one desire
Sands of the conqueror
Where kingdoms fall and fade
The echoes of eternity
Remember what he made
Through blood and fire, through steel and bone
He built a world to call his own
But even kings must kneel at last
Before the sands of time they've passed
Beyond the river's distant gleam
He chased the edge of dream
The oracle spoke in riddled tone
Oh, God should walk alone
He heard the call, defied the sign
And crossed the mortal line
The earth grew still beneath his stride
The sky itself had cried
Through storm and stone his name was cast
A dream too bright to last
For every crown the lightning bore
The silence wanted more
Sands of the conquered o'er, where kingdoms fall and fade
The echoes of eternity remember what he made
Through blood and fire, through steel and bone
He built a world to call his own
But even gods must bow at last
Before the sands that claim the past
In distant lands his legend sleeps
Where iron fades and marble weeps
No sword, no stone, no golden home
Can hold the names that dare to call
The winds still whisper soft unseen
The world was once a dream
Fans of the conqueror
The throne of dust remains
The echoes of eternity
Still sing his ancient reign
He walked the fire, he touched the divine
He paid the price for crossing the line
Now in the desert's endless burst
He lives as legend, bound to the past
The sand remembers, the sky ives But man ets who truly lives
