Right now, I got no fears, all tough
This is the dream I'm invited to have
I hope it will end all those nightmares
This is the scream I'm invited to have
I hope it's the end of all those nightmares
Right now I got no fears out of my peace matrix
And all those lights in my eyes suddenly disappeared
This is what we've been waiting to have
And all those lights in my eyes suddenly disappeared
I hope it's the end of all those nightmares
