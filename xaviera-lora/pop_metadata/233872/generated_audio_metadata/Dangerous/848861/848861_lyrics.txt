Watch.
Did she leave again like a fair weather friend in your time of need
Tell me are you waiting
Guessing while she's contemplating
Did she bless your stare in a dark nightmare as you wither slowly
Writhing as she made you holy
She'll make you feel like perfect sorrow
Bleed you and then leave tomorrow
Clutching'til your soul will strive
Another flawless alibi
Creeping, grieving
Deceiving (watch out)
Not leaving
Did she finalize on a short goodbye as you staggered, weak and breaking (watch out)
Making every word forsaken
Did she laugh and grin as the knife went in with the moment, dainty?
I'm very sorry that you met me
She'll make you feel like perfect sorrow
Bleed you and then leave tomorrow
Clutching'til your soul will strive
Another flawless alibi
Creeping (watch out)
Grieving
Deceiving
Not leaving
