I start to get proud of me
I've got the eyes to see you
Firelight in my heart
Is the right way to go

Dancing to the rhythm
Dancing to the rhythm
Dancing to the rhythm
Dancing to the rhythm of love

I'm sitting on a piece of wood
Somewhere in the jungle
I'm alone - only me
Somewhere in the jungle
And I'm wishing you were next to me
Somewhere in the jungle
Then everything will changing me

Dancing to the rhythm
Dancing to the rhythm
Dancing to the rhythm
Dancing to the rhythm of love
