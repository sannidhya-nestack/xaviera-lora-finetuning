I hold your body next to mine.
The feel of your heartbeat sending a chill running up my spine.
Wakin' up to a Sunday morning, a kiss from you to show me the way.
Won't you wrap your arms around me?  Hold me like I want you to.
I want to grow another day younger with you.

Gentle breezes brush your hair.
The sun beams in your eyes and pardon me if I stare!
It's never been like this before, I wish that I could stay.
Won't you wrap your arms around me?  Hold me like I want you to.
I want to grow another day younger with you.

I've spent so many nights alone.
It's nice to know you're there in my dreams when I get home.
But wakin' up to a Sunday morning, I wish that you were here....
So you could wrap your arms around me.  Hold me like I want you to.
I want to grow another day younger with you.
Another day younger with you.
