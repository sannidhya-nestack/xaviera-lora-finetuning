I was scared that night in the bitter cold
Walking on the street, out there searching high and low

Nothing to lose, kept running to the light
I was hungry and lost
That night

I learned to make it through all the silent days
Tired and bored of those men and their foolish ways

I dreamed of your touch that reached into my soul
I was locked in a world alone

But when you took my hand on that screaming night
You came and rescued me
And I felt alive
Brought me back to life
That night

I was down and out but you took me back home
I recognised that place, It’s a place I’ve been before

Now you’ve found the key that stops this crazy mind
You gave me hope
That night 

That night
That night
