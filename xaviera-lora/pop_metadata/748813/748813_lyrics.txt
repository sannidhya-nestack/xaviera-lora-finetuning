Time to go
It's time to go
Whatever this means
He's happy it seems

After night
In boundless light
He calls my name
I do the same

So i'll be a fleeting sound, 
a light way out on the water
and i know his secret name and 
tell him about the nighttime

After this
A simple kiss
return my eyes
a true disguise
The gentle accent moves me forward
With secrets that I know are true

So i'll be a fleeting sound, 
a light way out on the water
and i know his secret name and 
tell him about the nighttime
