Mixed metaphors

I'm trying to write this song
got the metre and the rhyme wrong 
the road was crowded with strangers faces
while you jostled right into my heart

Mixed metaphors are all I have
to describe what I feel for you
mixed metaphors are all i Have
to describe what I feel for you

I'm trying to find the words
turning away from your candle lit smile
the taxi was right at the corner but I walked 
a million heart stopping miles

Mixed metaphors are all I have
to describe what I feel for you
mixed metaphors are all i Have
to describe what you do to me

words are all gone haywire
the grammar seems all messy 
the sentences don't flow
now i'm left with odd syllables
