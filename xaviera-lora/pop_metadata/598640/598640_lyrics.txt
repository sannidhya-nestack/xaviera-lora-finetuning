Deeply

(Verse 1)
I give in
You slipped through my barricade
I’ve hidden
Feelings that I’m scared to face
Behind camouflage I fear this fate

(chorus)
I’m deeply in love with you
To please each sweet part of you
Completely, is everything I need
Because my soft skin, it longs for you
Each breath in, belongs to you
You’re deep in, so deeply in my heart

(verse) 
I love you
That is all I know
You seep through
Flesh into my soul
I’m helplessly bound in rapture with you

(chorus 2)
I’m deeply in love with you
To please each sweet part of you
Completely, is why I’m in this world
Because my soft skin, it longs for you
Each breath in, belongs to you
You’re deep in, so deeply in my heart
