Verse 1
now she combs her hair
got her homework
painting up her nails just right
pink with the red
and she's on her phone
with her boyfriend
says he'll always love her and
they're forever
thirteen
seemed like such a
good dream
time must fly
can't even count the days
times change
people go their own ways
life moves on
no matter what they say

Chorus
may be you'll see me
may be i'll walk by
and may be you'll meet me
party all night
won’t that be nice
may be you'll love me
may be I'll hold you tight
but may be you'll hate me
Looking to fight
so wrong but I could be right

Verse 2
now he's in his car
got the roof down
and it's off to college now
California
and he's on his phone
with his girlfriend
and she says she'll wait for him
know what I mean
eighteen
that will be the
best teen
just can't wait
my minutes seem like days
times change
people go their own ways
life moves on
no matter what they say
