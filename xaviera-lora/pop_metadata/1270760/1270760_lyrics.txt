[Verse]
Smiley face can't show my heart
Thumbs up doesn't play the part
Winking eye but you're still far
Beyond emojis here we start

[Verse 2]
Crying face won't help me now
Broken heart and shattered vow
ROFL but I can't bow
Words mean more but I don't know how

[Chorus]
Beyond emojis I can't feel
Speak the truth let's keep it real
No LOL will seal the deal
Emoticons can't help me heal

[Verse 3]
Heart eyes but my soul is blue
100 signs still missing you
Fire flames but there's no view
Spark of love in all we do

[Chorus]
Beyond emojis I can't feel
Speak the truth let's keep it real
No LOL will seal the deal
Emoticons can't help me heal

[Bridge]
Ghosting love in pixel art
Find the way back to my heart
Hugging faces drift apart
Digital love ain't so smart
