the sun is hot and blazin'
there's no cloud in sight
'guess a monday can feel right

it makes us look amazing
but we're the cautious kind
it gets us through the night

we could be dancin' in the shadow
and still be blinding so bright
the eye in the sky

cuz we are surrounded by a halo
that will keep us mystified
accept no compromise

like Mona Lisa owns her smile
we're painted in love
painted in love

like Rembrandt owns the night
we're painted in love
painted in love

oho oho oh oh ooo
we're painted in love
painted in love

oho oho oh oh ooo
we're painted in love
painted in love

we got what we were cravin' for
didn't seek to find
what makes us feel allright

now all we do is gazin'
in each others eyes
till our bodies slow collide

we could be livin' loud in limbo
don't care 'bout day and night
we'll shine our own light

we're getting wiser 'bout what we don't know
we're just out  of our minds
doin' doin' it right


like Mona Lisa owns her smile
we're painted in love
painted in love

like Rembrandt owns the night
we're painted in love
painted in love

oho oho oh oh ooo
we're painted in love
painted in love

oho oho oh oh ooo
we're painted in love
painted in love
