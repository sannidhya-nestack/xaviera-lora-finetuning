Just be

there are days i just want to breathe
is that too much to ask for some relief
take a rest relieve the stress clear my mind
this world is getting so heavy on my shoulders
heated arguments are leaving me colder
can't you see all i really need is just to be

Chorus
take a walk in the park let the dog bark
watch an old movie on tv
chill out in a warm blanket
with a bowl of chocolate chip ice cream
nothing to do just be

my guitar has rusty strings
once upon a time i'd play and sing
now it's a chore wish i had more time to kill
this world is getting so heavy on my shoulders
heated arguments are leaving me colder
can't you see all i really need is just to be

Repeat chorus

the sands of time are flowing down
one day i won't be around
days go by and i loose track
wish that i could get them back

Chorus
