[Verse]
Tangled up in blankets
In our candlelit abode
You and me together
Hearts no longer on the road
No fancy nights or flashing lights
Just you and I alone
In our little haven
Where we've made our love a home

[Verse 2]
No crowded places
No more wandering around
Finding joy in silence
In the comfort we have found
Everyday's a blessing
As we dance to our own tune
In our humble castle
Love shining like the moon

[Chorus]
Cozy love
Cozy love
Forever side by side
Wrapped in laughter and warmth
No need to hide
Our little sanctuary
A haven from the world
Cozy love
Cozy love
Where happiness unfurls
