25 To Life

to have
is not to hold
so baby please don't go
cuz your Heart would just grow cold
if would you go
you're always on my mind
25 to life

i'm gonna make you feel alright
hold you close
till your all tongue tied

i'll be the first one in your sight
and the last one
before ya say goodnight

i’ll taste your dinner and your wine
cut the sugar
but i’ll raise the spice

i'm gonna make your world so bright
so i will find you
even in the blind

you you you
to keep you happy and
for good good good
so don't be a fool
and obey my rules

and your muse

so baby please don't go
cuz your heart will grow so cold
if you go alone
so i'll just rewrite your life
till you're mister right
in my own paradise
cuz you're always on my mind
25 to life


i'm the one you will desire
so surrender
i don't compromise

gonna burn you eyes with fire
if you take a peek
at someone else's stride

no i don't like your little lies
so kiss my feet
and apologize

i'll be your shadow till you die
even haunt you
in the afterlive

you know i'll do this all for
love love love
and i need a little
more more more
when it comes to love
i'm a bit hardcore

your mom
and your whore

so baby please don't go
cuz your heart will feel so cold
if you go alone
so i'll just rewrite your life
till you're mister right
in my own paradise

25 to life

all these things i demand
are meant to make you mine
till the end of time
tonight
so i'll just rewrite your life
till you're mister right
in my own paradise
you're always on my mind
25 to life

to have is not to hold
so baby please don't go
cuz your heart will feel so cold
if you go alone
so i'll just rewrite your life
till you're mister right
in my own paradise
you're always on my mind
25 to life
