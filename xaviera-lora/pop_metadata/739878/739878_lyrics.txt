verse 1
Come together, when the working day is done
Come together people celebrate     
Bring together to connect is what we want  
Come together and elevate

verse 2
Come together, like a family here to stay
Come together, people let's create
Bring together not tomorow but today
Come together it just feels great

Chorus
Reach out, to anyone
of all the walks of life
Feel good, the limit is the sky

Reach out, to anyone
of all the sorts and size
Enjoy, it makes you feel alive

verse 3
Come together, people dare to join the ride
Come together on this brand new day
Bring together, everyone's a superstar
Come together just to celebrate

Make me feel like singing 8x

Guitarsolo

Chorus
Reach out, to anyone
of all the walks of life
Feel good, the limit is the sky

Reach out, to anyone
of all the sorts and size
Enjoy, it makes you feel alive

Make me feel like singing 8x

Uh, yeah..
