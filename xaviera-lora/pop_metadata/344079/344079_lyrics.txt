The finer things in life  just suddenly appear
So subtle yet so clear
The past can disappear over time
Let it go and hold the finer things in life
Shown simply in a smile seen only by the heart
In every ocean breeze and 100 year old trees
So if you look it where youll find the finer things in life

To look within‘s to leave the illusions and the fears
In the stillness comes the meaning
One heart felt moment it was clear
The finer things in life  have always been right here
