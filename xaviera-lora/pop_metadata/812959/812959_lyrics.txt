I wanna buy you diamonds, I wanna buy you pearls 
Fly you to every corner of the world 
If I only had the means I’d give you everything 
But 'til then have some faith in our little dream

You gotta be 
All in on love 
All in on love 
All in on love 
You gotta be you gotta be 
You gotta be 
All in on love 
All in on love 
All in on love 
You gotta be you gotta be

I’m gonna work my tail off, and make a happy home 
I'll fix your car, I'll even fix your telephone 
I am gonna cherish you like you have never been 
Love will light our fortune baby if you’ll join in 

Chorus

You gotta be you gotta be 
All in on love 
You gotta be you gotta be 
All in on love 
You gotta be you gotta be all in on love 


Don't play with those bad boys, they'll mess you up inside 
They don't give a damn, they're gonna take you for a ride 
Give you lots of empty words, but nothing from the heart 
Our love is special so come on and take part

You gotta be 
All in on love 
All in on love 
All in on love 
You gotta be you gotta be 
You gotta be 
All in on love 
All in on love 
All in on love 
You gotta be you gotta be
