Verse 1:
Oh my god she's so damn pretty
Looking at me mouthing every word of the songs that I sing
Smiles at me as she catches me staring
Looking New York pretty, she could
Change everything

All my walls are breaking
Involuntarily
As I sing, for her in
New York City

Chorus:
Wo oh oh,
Every move, every breath every word that you say
Wo oh oh, I'm coming  home
Wo oh ho
I want you in the front row of my life now baby
wo oho oh oh, I say wo oho oh oh
New York

Verse 2:
Singing every word I've ever written
Everyone and everything in this room just fades away
And every kiss from you I imagine
Will be more than enough girl to make me stay

All my walls are breaking
As she sings with me
From the front row, of my gig
In New York City

Chorus:
Wo oh oh,
Every move, every breath every word that you say
Wo oh oh, I'm coming  home
Wo oh ho
I want you in the front row of my life now baby
wo oho oh oh, I say wo oho oh oh
New York
