Something just has got to give
Cause I can’t leave and you won’t bend
The little things they just don’t get bigger
It’s never enough then it doesn’t get better

Life comes in small, medium and large
Sometimes it’s good 
Sometimes it’s hard
Life comes in small, medium and large
Sometimes it’s good

Someone takes Someone gives
You do what you do 
It’s just what it is
And when it’s sweet It’s not for long
It’s not where you stay it’s how you move on

Life comes in small, medium and large
Sometimes it’s good 
Sometimes it’s hard
Life comes in small, medium and large
Sometimes it’s good

So I will love you tonight
You know it’s never just right
Days they come then they’re gone
Life goes on
You Just got to go on

Something’s just has got to give
Cause you can’t leave and I won’t bend
