If you called me yesterday
Things would’ve been the same
But you called me today
Now everything has changed

I am living in paranoia
I am tired of not breathing
I feel like jumping from the sky
and not be scared at all to die

How much I don't know
Like broken bones being
tied up, dangling in the wind
Then it came to me what it 
is that makes me happy

I am living in paranoia
I am tired of not breathing
I feel like jumping from the sky
and not be scared at all to die

I am sick of it

I'm running thru a storm
Spirit changing form
I'm running thru a storm
Spirit changing form
