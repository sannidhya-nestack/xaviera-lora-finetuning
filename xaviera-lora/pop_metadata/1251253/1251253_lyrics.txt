[Verse]
Sun is shining through the sky
We got no plans just you and I
Laughter echoes in the breeze
Living like we're wild and free

[Verse 2]
Morning swims and sandy toes
All the joys that summer shows
Ice cream melting in our hands
Watching waves crash on the sands

[Chorus]
Summer days with you so fine
Every moment feels divine
Chasing sunsets painting skies
With you by my side it flies

[Verse]
Road trips down those winding lanes
Wind in hair with no restraints
Picnic spread beneath the trees
Sharing dreams just you and me

[Bridge]
Starry nights and campfire songs
In your arms is where I belong
Memories in every hue
Summer days so sweet with you

[Chorus]
Summer days with you so fine
Every moment feels divine
Chasing sunsets painting skies
With you by my side it flies
