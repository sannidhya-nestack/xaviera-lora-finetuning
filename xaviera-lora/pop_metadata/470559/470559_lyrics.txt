Silence sleeps into my world
And it follows into my dreams

Moonbeams flicker across my room
And in a twilight
You thought to be broken

And when the sun goes down
A shadow is cast on this stand
And when the sun goes down
Then I breath free

Your dreams echo my minds high
And this stay light
painting the sky

Sun comes crossing the wall 
We breathing sunrise
and resting arise

And when the sun goes down
A shadow is cast on this stand
And when the sun goes down
Then I breath free
