I was 17 and he was too,
the best of friends we made it through together,
whatever came our way.
He saw me cry but he made me laugh.
Probably did things we shouldn't have,
but I'd never take them back.
Sitting here missin' him, wondering how he's been
since then
Sometimes he'll cross my mind, takes me back to that time
And I wonder if,
What if we kept our promises?
What if we never did forget?
What if we meant all the beautiful things we said?
What if he made me, made me stay?
And he was still mine today
What if we could, forgive and rebegin
and be 17 again
ohh
We'd sit by the fire and kiss too long,
then he'd play guitar and I'd sing along.
I swear the sound was magic to me
And I didn't care if we were all we had
Say "I love you" with the squeeze of my hand
Back before, growing up began
And now I sit here missing him, wondering how he's been
since then
Sometimes he'll cross my mind, takes me back to that time
And I wonder if,
What if we kept our promises?
What if we never did forget?
What if we meant all the beautiful things we said?
What if he made me, made me stay?
And he was still mine today
What if we could, forgive and rebegin
and be 17 again
woah,
I've never hurt and I've never loved again like that
If the first real love you have, is actually the last
then I can't talk about us
What if we kept our promises?
What if we never did forget?
What if we meant all the beautiful things we said?
What if he made me, made me stay?
And he was still mine today
What if we could, forgive and rebegin
and be 17 again
oh, ooh
