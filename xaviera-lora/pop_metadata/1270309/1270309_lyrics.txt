Walking down the empty street
Stars alight they softly greet
Dreams that fade but still so sweet
Just like you and I could meet

[Verse 2]
Whispers in the midnight air
Echoes of a love so rare
Underneath the skies we stare
Wonder if you still care

[Chorus]
Once in a blue moon
I think of you
Once in a blue moon
Dreams come true

[Verse 3]
City lights are fading slow
Memories they start to glow
Through the darkness we both know
Stories of our hearts they show

[Bridge]
Time can't change what we feel
Every moment feels so real
Hand in hand the world we steal
Love that never needs to heal

[Chorus]
Once in a blue moon
I think of you
Once in a blue moon
Dreams come true
