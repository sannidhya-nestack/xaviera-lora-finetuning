I forget everything
Try again and again
Just to say how it is
But it's hard to begin

Am I fooling myself?
There's just nobody else
Maybe love is a wish
That will need a little help

Do you see me at all?
Do you need me at all?
Is it unrequited?
Tell me before

I am loosing my mind
Cos you're one of a kind
In your world
I am falling a little behind

So when I 
Wake up alone and I’m still here on my own
Without you
Time will remind me, the hours will go slow, oh
I surrender myself, I'm embracing the unknown
I want you
But still I am waiting for something you don't show

If you don't have a heart
If it's cold or maybe locked
Just let me convince you
I'm all that you want 

Can't you pick up the phone?
Call, you know that I'm home
Again they're
Playing our love song on the radio

So when I
Wake up alone and I’m still here on my own
Without you
Time will remind me, the hours will go slow, oh
I surrender myself, I'm embracing the unknown
I want you
But still I am waiting for something you don't show, you don’t show

When you don’t reply
I am paralyzed
Can a broken heart mend itself?

And I can’t deny
I am terrified
Cos I’m not ready to say farewell

I wake up alone and I’m still here on my own
Without you
Time will remind me, the hours will go slow, oh
I surrender myself, I'm embracing the unknown
I want you
But still I am waiting for something you don't show

So when I
Wake up alone and I’m still here on my own
Without you
Time will remind me, the hours will go slow, oh
I surrender myself, I'm embracing the unknown
I want you
But still I am waiting for something you don't show
