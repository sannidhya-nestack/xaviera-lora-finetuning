Who can I adore?
I'm not really sure
How to find that perfect girl
I've never met before

If you wake up one day
Walk right by my place
Will I look out the window
In time to see your face?

Is it magic?
Or am I tragic?
How am I supposed to see
if you're meant for me?
Am I lonely?
Are you my only?
When I find you, I'll believe
There's some magic left for me

This lady on my mind
Sweet as she is fine
Caught up in the mystery
Of my future valentine

If you'll come from the stars
And show me who you are
We'll match the puzzle pieces
And we'll solve it with our hearts

Tired of tossing
Turning out the lights
Alone at night
But that's all right
Yeah, that's all right
