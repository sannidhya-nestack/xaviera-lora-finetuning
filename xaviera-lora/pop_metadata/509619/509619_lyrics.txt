Spinning

Whatever I had is gone
Whatever I thought was wrong
And I just keep stumbling on
The same old stones

I know when to hit the ground
When everything’s falling down
But I just keep waiting round
And nothing is changing it’s always the same thing

Chorus:
I just keep getting into situations
I just keep on retracing my steps
And my intuition keeps on telling me run but I keep on standing still
I’m spinning

You’re just a fool like me
We play this game endlessly 
But you know it’s hard to free
A dog from it’s chain when it just wants to stay oh

Chorus (we)

PIRATE BRIDGE

Load your gun it’s off to war we go
The time has come 
This is something that we both know
This is the part where we make the story end
We’ve got to fight until somebody wins

Chorus (can’t)
