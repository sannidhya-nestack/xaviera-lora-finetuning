Right Now


you're fooling 'round with your friends
right on the dance floor
you dress so fine fine 
living in a perfect world

but what's supposed to happen 
when it's all the same
i don't wanna another fancy face yeah 

suddenly i just realize
we are moving to a different phase
day by day i know what happens now
i won't make it through another day

Right now, i don't wanna think
our love just fade away

it will take a while for me to heal this 
you're not the one for me i feel
and if i feel i gotta say now
we crossed the same street the other day

suddenly i just realize
we are moving to a different phase
day by day i know what happens now
i won't make it through another day

Right now, i don't wanna think
our love just fade away

Right now, i don't wanna think
