I need to let go of some things
I need to forget everything
I need to let go and let some light in
Some things ill try to ignore
Some days ill fall to the floor
But ill get by and ill fight through it all

You pick me up when I’m in pieces on the ground
You lift me up give me a reason to be found

CHORUS
I don’t know who I am how to be anymore
I don’t know how to feel how to breathe like before
I need to
I need to let go

I need to learn to trust again
I need to let you be my friend
Forget the past and find myself and then
You will give me strength I know
Make you proud now even though
It may take some time but I won’t be thrown

Now that you see me for who I really am
You can release me and let me start again

CHORUS
I don’t know who I am how to be anymore
I don’t know how to feel how to breathe like before
I need to
I need to let go


BRIDGE
I keep wanting to feel alive
Keep wondering what its like
To live to be and to breathe
 Your with me
Your with me

CHORUS
I don’t know who I am how to be anymore
I don’t know how to feel how to breathe like befor
I need to
I need to let go
