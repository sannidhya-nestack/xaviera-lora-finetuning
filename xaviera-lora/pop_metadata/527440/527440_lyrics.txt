You’re chasing moonbeams
So You’ll stay unique
between these post modern geeks
makes sense to me

you swear to gluten free
Just lemme try that
Yeah, i live at the beach
at my moms retreat

You said you liked my new beard
And you digged my scene
You just Wanna Hang with some beers

You’re as cool as neon jeans
Crazy as Charly Sheen
Tasty like the vegan cuisine

Don’t call it love
We like uncharted
and we don’t care ‘bout the complicated stuff

we’ll have some fun
with something casual
doin’ things that makes our hearts buzz

We'll be trippin' like the young turks
We'll be trippin' like the young turks


so you lost your job,
Yeah all those coperate thieves
they won’t treat you discreet
i’ll see what you mean

no i’m no snob
i like indie
'cuz only vinyl smells real
hate mp3

there’s no head over heels
cuz we don’t like extremes
we just wanna hang with some beers

so lets drive in low gear
we know how we feel
today we’re just exploring frontiers

Don’t call it love
Cuz we like uncharted
and we don’t care ‘bout the complicated stuff

we’ll have some fun
with something casual
doin’ things that makes our hearts buzz

We'll be trippin' like the young turks
We'll be trippin' like the young turks
We'll be trippin' like the young turks
We'll be trippin' like the young turks


Don’t call it love
Cuz we like uncharted
and we don’t care ‘bout the complicated stuff

we’ll have some fun

We'll be trippin' like the young turks
and we don’t care ‘bout the complicated stuff

We'll be trippin' like the young turks
doin’ things that makes our hearts buzz

We'll be trippin' like the young turks
We'll be trippin' like the young turks
We'll be trippin' like the young turks
We'll be trippin' like the young turks
