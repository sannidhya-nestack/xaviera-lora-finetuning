VERSE
When I think of you my heart breaks 
Its been so long since I have seen your face
I have never felt so alone
how am I supposed to carry on

CHORUS 2
cause I just wanna be with you
I can't breathe without you
I can't believe you're gone  
 everything is wrong
and I can't breathe without you

VERSE
hold me one more time...... in  my dreams
I still hear your voice inside  my head
I can see you smiling at me
I just need to have you here again

CHORUS
cause I just wanna be with you
I can't breathe without you
I can't believe you're gone
 everything is wrong
and I can't breathe without you

BRIDGE
Nothing means anything anymore
I'd give everything to see you walk through that door

CHORUS
I just wanna be with you
I can't breathe without you
I can't believe you're gone
 everything is wrong
and I can't breathe without you
