Prechorus:

You wanna use your way to the top,
because a pretty face is what you got,
you wanna drive all the fast cars,
hang out with the all-stars,
but baby tell me when will it stop?

Verse 1:

She's right in front of you but you can't see,
she gonna use you like she did to me.
So let me give ya' couple words of advice,
just run run run run,
'cuz she ain't nice!

Prechorus:

You wanna use your way to the top, (Here she come...)
because a pretty face is what you got, (There she go...)
you wanna drive all the fast cars,
hang out with the all-stars, (Shiftin' gears)
but baby tell me when will it stop? (Oh no!)

Chorus:

Oh yeah she wants you, but just how long is that gon' last?
She wants to spend dimes with you, but you ain't got that cash?
She gone, she gone, she gone now...
She gone, she gone, she gone now...

Verse 2:

When will you wake up and get a clue,
she gonna leave ya' feelin' down and blue!
And when your credit and your cash is gone,
she got another man that she'll put on!

Prechorus:

You wanna use your way to the top, (Here she come...)
because a pretty face is what you got, (There she go...)
you wanna drive all the fast cars,
hang out with the all-stars, (Shiftin' gears)
but baby tell me when will it stop? (Oh no!)

Chorus:

Oh yeah she wants you, but just how long is that gon' last?
She wants to spend dimes with you, but you ain't got that cash?
She gone, she gone, she gone now...
She gone, she gone, she gone now...

Bridge:

Oh oh oh oh oh oh...
Oh oh oh oh oh oh...
Oh oh oh oh oh oh...
Oh oh oh oh oh oh...
She gone!

Chorus:

Oh yeah she wants you, but just how long is that gon' last?
She wants to spend dimes with you, but you ain't got that cash?
She gone, she gone, she gone now...
She gone, she gone, she gone now...

Ending:

You wanna use your way... (She gone)
to the top!
...Use your way (She gone)
top!

You wanna use your way... (She gone)
to the top!
...Use your way (She gone)
top!
