I’m the one


I see you’re face now everyday and it’s funny how I don’t know what to say.
You’re always living it up with some helpless Romeo.
But something tells me they’re not what you’re looking for.

I know.  Do you know this is killing me?
You don’t need those boys around you anymore ‘cause I’m the one.

I know you’re wondering when I’ll meet with you.
And how impressed you’re going to be.
If you only knew the half of what I’d offer you.
You might be sitting here with me.

Somehow things don’t turn the way you think they should.
I know you feel something deep inside of you ‘cause I’m the one.
