All the good love
All the good good loving has gone

You know you didn't even have to say
I had a feeling when you stayed away 
too long

It's no good acting out this fantasy
when everybody in the world can see 
It's wrong

It's just a fantasy
and all the world can see
all the loving has gone


Chorus:-
All the good love
All the good good loving has gone


Now I'm just gazing at the sky above
it seems a long time since we had a love
so strong

You know just lately you've been acting strange
I got a feeling that you're gonna change 
your song

Yes you've been acting strange
I know you're gonna change
all the loving has gone
