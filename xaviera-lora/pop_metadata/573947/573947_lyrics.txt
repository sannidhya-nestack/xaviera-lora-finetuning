Wonderful
© Eric Schweitzer, Melissa Lee

You’re lovely
Completely
So different from my yesterdays
I don’t question, how deeply
I know your love is for always

Stories in your eyes
There for all to see
The rhythm of your heart
Beating next to me tell me

You're wonderful
You make me feel alive
Got me smiling inside
You're wonderful
The sun up in my sky
You don’t even try
You’re wonderful

No picture
Can capture
The magic of someone so beautiful
The sparkle of your laughter
As I whisper soft and low

The stories in your eyes
They’re for all to see
The rhythm of your heart
Beating next to me tell me

You're wonderful
You make me feel alive
Got me smiling inside
You're wonderful
The sun up in my sky
You don’t even try
You’re wonderful

You’re the silver in my cloud
I must have dreamed you
I wonder if you even know
Do you even know?

You're wonderful
You make me feel alive
Got me smiling inside
You're wonderful
The sun up in my sky
You don’t even try
You’re wonderful

You're wonderful
You make me feel alive
Got me smiling inside
You're wonderful
The sun up in my sky
You don’t even try
You’re wonderful
