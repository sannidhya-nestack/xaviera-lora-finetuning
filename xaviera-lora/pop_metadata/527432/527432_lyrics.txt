You looked at me like a natural born James Dean
Running your fingers through my hair
Our lips came near

It was the harvest moon that would start our lover’s year
Tangled in trust, we shared our bed
Our souls were sealed

Bye bye bitterness, making my walls fall down
Crazy promisses, turning my world around

But you had to go
You had to leave me high and dry
How could I have known
That our hearts were not aligned
You just walked out on me
And Like a cold winter breeze
You froze the love that left me blind
Now I am wandering alone
Piecing the puzzle of your mind
I loved a devil with angelic eyes

I don’t need to know you’ve now found your mate
Don’t wanna rain on your parade
As your taillights fade

I don’t care you’ve found the love you’ve lost for years
I’m done with wasting tears
Done but not yet healed

No more bitterness, making my walls fall down
Crazy promisses, turning my world around

Cause you had to go
You had to leave me high and dry
How could I have known
That our hearts were not aligned
You just walked out on me
And Like a cold winter breeze
You froze the love that left me blind
Now I am wandering alone
Piecing the puzzle of your mind
I loved a devil with angelic eyes

And I have cried so many nights,
Feeling numb throughout the days
Wandering how wrong could feel so right
How you left like a thief in the night
Now I don’t mind anymore

Cause I’m blessed with you gone
Although you left me high and dry
I couldn’t have known
That our hearts were not aligned
You just walked out on me
Like a cold winter breeze
Freezing the love that made me blind
Now I’m wandering no more
solving the puzzle of your mind
Cause’ I loved a devil with angelic eyes
