I Believe In Us
Honesty in my heart of hearts
is all I want It's all I need
honesty oh

tenderness in the eyes of love
will bridge the faults
and sow its seed
tenderness oh

let's start again without worry
give our differences to something bigger
if we can do that it's another life another life for us

load up the car dogs included 
there's a lot of road we've got to cover
with every mile there's another chance another chance for us, oh

all of this comes down to trust
all the way I believe in us
all the way I believe in us
all the way
