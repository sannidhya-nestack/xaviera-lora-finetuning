Deaf, dumb and blind
it's how i hide 
my darker side 
from you
guess i tried
to make you love the lie
of my tainted pride
to proof
to me
that if hearts collide 
it'll mystify
two fools
you don't fight
my circle of silence 
i'll cast aside
for you

let me Breath in fearless
breath out sheer kisses
i'll let you steal pieces
of my heart
don't let me bleeding needless
feelin' meaningless
just shelter my release 
in your arms

lost my rhyme
can't scream, can't cry
cause you're inside
my core
i'll testify
my guilt, my crime
i can't deny
you no more
i'm done
flying blind
being unaligned
with you
i'll sacrifice
my circle of silence
and bide my time
for you

let me Breath in fearless
breath out sheer kisses
while i'll let you steal pieces
of my heart
don't let me bleeding needless
feelin' meaningless
please shelter my release 
in your arms
 
Deaf, dumb and blind
i no longer hide 
my darker side 
from you
 
Breath in fearless
breath out helpless
i'm bleeding tearless
in this circle of silence 

let me Breath in fearless
breath out tearless 
while you keep stealing pieces
of my heart
don't let me bleeding needless
feelin' helpless
let me feel release 
in your arms
