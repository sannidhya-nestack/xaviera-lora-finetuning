You say
There’s nothing like living in the summer sun
There’s nothing like leaving when the winter comes
Nothing like feeling the rays, ok

You feel
There’s nothing like a little bit of sex appeal 
Just the look in their eyes and it feels so real 
There’s nothing in the sky but blue, all day

Now the world’s always spinning and the seasons keep winning
And the time how it is stealing, yeah, it’s so revealing
Contemplating on a moment that makes you want to float away
Although your life’s a bit a flutter step away from all the clutter
Walking out into the future like a passenger/commuter 
Talking/taking yourself into, another day, this way

You see
You hide away, hey, you conceal
And reality, it seems so unreal
To ever show its play, on today

You know
There’s nothing like being the star of the show
And nothing like having the right to grow
There’s nothing like driving away, ok

So the world is turning and time keeps a burning
And your train keeps a running as your friends go and coming
Custom making yourself, so, underplayed
Lemonade, now you’re cooler, tailor made to be the ruler
Pucker up you’re still a looker, activate the pressure cooker 
Captivating yourself, another stay 
And the world’s always spinning and the seasons keep winning
And the time how it is stealing, yeah, it’s so revealing
Contemplating on a moment that makes you want to float away
Although your life’s a bit a flutter step away from all the clutter
Walking out into the future like a passenger/commuter 
Talking/taking yourself into, another day, this way, 
ok
