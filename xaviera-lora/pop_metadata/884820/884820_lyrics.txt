An addictive existence never ending
 will come and go
Can you tell me the price for independence
Come on, come on, mon amour

Tell me what you think about the trading
Of milk for love
La vie n’est pas du bouffon cinéma, mais
En générale, je n'ai pas de réponses

-Bridge-
 If one day the Sun is down and out
And the mountains crumble
When one day the Sun is down and out
And we will, and we will

-Choir-
And then we will arise
And then we will surprize
Flying about high and low
Une existence frivole

It’s not a cup of tea
It’s our reality
Some dance to stay, some dance to go
La liberté est le droit

NASA on the hunt for exoplanets
we hunt for news
We are stars (an') we are slowly dying
in the centre of the Milky Way

breathing stardust on the way to freedom
come back alive
The addictive existence is a bubble,
c'est une bulle qui danse dans les rayons
