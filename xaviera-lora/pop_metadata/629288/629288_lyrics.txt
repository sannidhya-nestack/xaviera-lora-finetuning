ONE EYE TWO EYES A MOUTH

One eye two eyes a mouth
Touch my skin
One eye two eyes a mouth
Hold me
One eye two eyes a mouth
Sit so close
One eye two eyes a mouth
Please me

Keep me close
More than you've ever done before
Don't sit
Don't bend your knees in front of me
Just rise up and be as you please
Just rise up and be as you please
Take me to theplace we don't know
There's a picture on the wall
With some islands and a shore
Would you know?
Would you know where to go?
Would you know where to go?
