You make me rush 
And then your late. 
You say you'll call
And then I wait. 
Behind your kiss 
I feel a joke. 
By night your rich 
By day your broke

I can't keep thinking that I made a mistake 
I can't keep guessing is it real 
Or is it fake 

I can't spend one minute more 
if I got to take….

9 Miles of Bullshit 
Everywhere I go with you 
9 Miles of Bullshit 
Time to take a shovel to 
9 Miles of Bullshit 
Dug your grave & now you're screwed 
9 Miles of Bullshit 
Every night I'm listening to 
9 Miles of Bullshit 


You used to be 
my favorite toy 
Now when you smile 
I get annoyed
I've given in 
I've given up 
seen you where you've been 
And called your bluff  

Now I know whats in that look on your face 
I can't keep covering for you 
all over the place 

9 Miles of Bullshit 
Everywhere I go with you 
9 Miles of Bullshit 
Time to take a shovel to 
9 Miles of Bullshit 
Dug your grave & now you're screwed 
9 Miles of Bullshit 
Every night I'm listening to 
9 Miles of Bullshit 

Get your suitcase 
Put it in the car 
Take your sad face 
you know what you are 
Save your crap 
for your buddies at the bar 
 I'm done done done 

with 

9 Miles of Bullshit 
Everywhere I go with you 
9 Miles of Bullshit 
Time to take a shovel to 
9 Miles of Bullshit 
Dug your grave & now you're screwed 
9 Miles of Bullshit 
Every night I'm listening to 
9 Miles of Bullshit
