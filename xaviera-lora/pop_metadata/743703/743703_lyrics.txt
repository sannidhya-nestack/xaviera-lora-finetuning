Live For Love

Live life with no regrets
Be happy, live paradise
Live and laugh, you won't forget
Live your dream

Be the one that makes it right
Don't give up it's worth every fight
Show your soul and stay true
Don't back down

We fall, we get back up
We all, we live for love

Be yourself and realize
That you're a star in all our eyes
The beauty within, it keeps you real 
Let's change the world 

Be the one that makes it right
Don't give up it's worth every fight
Show your soul and stay true
Don't back down

We fall, we get back up
We all, we live for love (x3)

Forget the hate
Change it for the one you love
Don't be afraid 
Be everything you can (x2)

We fall, we get back up 
We all, we live for love (x2)
