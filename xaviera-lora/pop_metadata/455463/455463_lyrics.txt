So Beautiful

I’ll be your holy cow
I’ll be your fattened sow
I’ll be your long lost brother
I’ll be your sacred vow
I’ll be your dutiful wife
I’ll be your lust for life
I’ll be your road to Mecca
I’ll be your sharpened knife

such a beautiful thing
You're beautiful so beautiful
such a beautiful thing
You're beautiful so beautiful
such a beautiful thing
You're beautiful so beautiful
such a beautiful thing
You're beautiful you make my bell ring
Ding ding ding ding

I’ll be your wayward child 
I’ll be your twisted smile 
I’ll be your one salvation
I’ll be your dog gone wild
I’ll be your private vice
I’ll be your grain of rice 
I’ll be your full attention
I’ll be your twice as nice 

Should I offer you my congratulations 
Do you fill all of my expectations
Will you save  me if I dine at your table
Can you see me looking through your window

You're beautiful

such a beautiful thing
You're beautiful so beautiful
such a beautiful thing
You're beautiful so beautiful
such a beautiful thing
You're beautiful so beautiful
such a beautiful thing
You're beautiful you make my bell ring
Ding ding ding ding
