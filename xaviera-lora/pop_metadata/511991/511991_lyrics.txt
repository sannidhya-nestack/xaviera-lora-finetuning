VERSE: 
I remember the day we met 
A million years, and I won’t forget
I didn’t know your name yet 
but when I looked into your eyes

All at once my heart had wings
I never thought in my wildest dreams
That I would ever / one day find these things
But now what we had has died

Here we are 
Doesn’t matter who’s to blame


CHORUS:
This is the last goodbye
We did the best we could
God knows we tried
If I could change things baby I would 
So dry your eyes
Cause we both know
This is the last goodbye


VERSE:
Another place in another time
The music plays and the words all rhyme
And everything works out just fine
And we’re back in love again

But all too quickly those dreams they fade
and its too much now the price we’ve paid
The time has come to turn the page 
and let the story end

Here we are
And no one is to blame


CHORUS:
This is the last goodbye
We did the best we could
God knows we tried – the fire has died / my hands are tied
If I could change things baby I would 
So dry your eyes
Cause we both know...


BRIDGE:
Goodbye to all the things we tried so hard to hold close
They slip away, and disappear like ghosts...


FINAL CHORUS:
This is the last goodbye
And I'm dying inside
God knows we tried
But baby we know... 
This is our last goodbye

Goodbye...
