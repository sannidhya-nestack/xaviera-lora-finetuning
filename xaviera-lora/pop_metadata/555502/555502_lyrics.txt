I'm fallin' inbetween
a sea of stars
feelin’ convicted by invisible chains

your shallow shades of grey
painted my heart
they left me blinded and in disarray

cuz you reigned over me
stalling love or war
and watered down my silent hurting and pain

now love's in reverse
the whole damn nine yards
the love you took didn't equal the love you made

and it doesn't seem change your ways
my love's in reverse
i'm taking back my days
don't seem to care that i've been lovin' in vain
the salt left on my skin
is gonna fade

I’ll wage a civil war
and be the bird of prey
who’ll chase ya away
a phoenix born from flames
i'll be makin'
makin' your day
You said that i was worth the wait
Guess i fell out of grace
and i've been trapped in your minefield of pain
no more ego arms race
cuz i'm walkin'
walkin' away
love in reverse is just here to stay
it's here to stay

you had to win my soul
took it with both hands
i surrendered everything that i use to own

but you needed more control
my heart was banned
now i’m done being your steppin’ stone

and it doesn't seem change your ways
that my love's in reverse
i'm taking back my days
you don't seem to care that i've been lovin' in vain
the salt left on my skin
is gonna fade

I’ll wage a civil war
and be the bird of prey
who’ll chase ya away
a phoenix born from flames
i'll be makin'
makin' your day
You said that i was worth the wait
Guess i fell out of grace
and i've been trapped in your minefield of pain
no more ego arms race
cuz i'm walkin'
walkin' away
love in reverse is just here to stay
it's here to stay

it was as good as love can get
but you had to waste it
waste it away
with my eyes on fire i fear no regret
cause i won't be missin'your plea to stay

free fallin' inbetween
a sea of stars
no more conviction by invisible chains

now love's in reverse
the whole damn nine yards
the love you took didn't equal the love you made

I’ll wage a civil war
and be the bird of prey
who’ll chase ya away
a phoenix born from flames
i'll be makin'
makin' your day
You said that i was worth the wait
Guess i fell out of grace
and i've been trapped in your minefield of pain
no more ego arms race
cuz i'm walkin'
walkin' away
love in reverse is just here to stay
it's here to stay
