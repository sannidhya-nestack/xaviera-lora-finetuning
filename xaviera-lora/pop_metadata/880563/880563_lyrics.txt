Sittin’ on the edge of the moon fishin’ for stars      
Danglin’ our feet in the clouds skippin’ stones from here to Mars   
Moving at the speed of love, space cadets marooned 
Fishin’ for stars on the edge of the moon    

Skinny dippin’ in the Milky Way, gravity done left town   
Bill Haley and the Comets, best damn band in Neptune town 
When we kiss up here forever lasts all afternoon 
Fishin’ for stars on the edge of the moon    

(Bridge)
I’d traverse the universe to blast off with you     
You’re my Intergalactical hottie 
Can’t take my hands off your celestial body 

Aurora Borealis dancin’ in you eyes    
I’m gonna bet you all the rings around Saturn that the planets are gonna align tonight    
Here in Cincinnati in this seedy motel room 
Fishin’ for stars on the edge of the moon
