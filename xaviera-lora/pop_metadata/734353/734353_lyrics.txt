"You (White House)" by Isadora 

I didn't know that I would stumble upon you * Was it fate or was it purely luck? * Yes, it must have been luck * Lucky to meet, lucky as one can be * He loves me fully truly * Is this real or is it all just a dream? * (Chorus) It's a white house and picket fences and green grass * You're one in a million * And baby no one fits the puzzle piece so perfectly like you do * You * I'll be any fantasy oh * Treat you as sweet as cotton candy oh * Tears of joy will only shed my love * And here stands a man who won't only take my hand * But understands like no one can and takes me just the way that I am * (Chorus) It's a white beach with a pretty sunset * A white light its picture perfect * I can't think of a single one that's gonna love the way that you do * You * Do you know you've got me wrapped around your finger? * And if you asked me if I wanted to stay later, I'd say neither * I wanna stay forever * (Chorus)
