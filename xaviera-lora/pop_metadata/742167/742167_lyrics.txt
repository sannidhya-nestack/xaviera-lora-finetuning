Work the week
Roll one tight and blow
Ease the tension 
Got to let it go

Clever how we play this game
Go hard got no shame
All that life can give 
But we needed more

Two shots take the dive
Three shots feel alive
Save a kiss for me
Living right, see?

Living right
Fresh like Michael Knight
Feeling so good
Yeah we're living right
Now we up all night
Pass the crown
Sip it up
Live it up
I suppose

Got your five pounds of fame
Now you’re into it knee deep
Back onto the stage
Cuz you needed more
Got your five pounds of fame
Break the cycle of repeat
Back onto the stage, yeah

Clutch the pipe
Vape the night away
A stoner is a loner either way
Dance on your church front porch
Making stains in your daddy’s Porsche
All that life can give 
But you needed more
Taste so good
Getting nice on a Maybach hood
Save a shot for me
Living right see?

Living right
Fresh like Michael Knight
Feeling so good
Yeah we're living right
Now we up all night
Pass the crown
Sip it up
Live it up
I suppose
Got your five pounds of fame
Now you’re into it knee deep
Back onto the stage
Cuz you needed more
Got your five pounds of fame
Break the cycle of repeat
Back onto the stage 
I suppose I suppose

Pass the crown
Sip it up
Live it up
I suppose
