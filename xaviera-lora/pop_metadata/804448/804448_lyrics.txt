You want it all 
Straight to the party 
Been here before 
So don't be tardy 
My talk means gold (ain't cheap) 
Don't take it lightly. 
Just write this down 
Take it Politely 

Right now baby baby 
You can make it happen 
Right now baby baby 
Make your mama proud 

I want a car in the Driveway 
Got it 
Check 
I want my music on replay 
Got it 
Check 
I want some flowers on the night stand 
Got it 
Check 
Cash money in the right hands 
Got it 
Check 

Before we get to doing this 
I think its clear to see  
I won't be going through with this 
to end up losing me

I want a car in the driveway 
Got it 
Check 
I want a car in the driveway 
Got it 
Check 

You want my time 
I want your hours. 
You give it all 
You'll get the power. 
My heart is gold
Won't let you break it 
Show some Respect
And we can make it 

Right now baby baby 
You can make it happen 
Right now baby baby 
Make your mama proud
