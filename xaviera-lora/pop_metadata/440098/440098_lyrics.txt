i'd like to know, just what you use,
a strange kind of love mixed with the blues, 
i'd like to know what creeped in my heart 
came in the night broke my heart
and gave me the blues 

i dream a dream 
its about you 
of the sweet tenderness 
sweet but so blue 

i know you're gone but you seem so near 
just across town about a million miles from here
i know your close and your hearts so near 
but your eyes always say your not here 
it breaks my my heart heart and my soul 
because its time to say goodbye 
and i just can't let go 

I'm not afraid to go this way 
heaven sent me a dream and 
and then took it away 
its time to go away from here 
as far as i can 
just about a million miles from here
