MAYBE THIS TIME


VERSE 1
There's a light outside my window
As the thoughts go through my mind
Well there's only one thing missing
To be with you one more time

So I've got something new to say to you
In my life I have been alone
How long just how long
Can I endure this heartache tune?
It seems to disappear when you're here

VERSE 2
Soon I think I'll get the answer
To the question of my heart
Well I'm ready to go forward
If we just give it a start

So I've got something new to say to you
In my life I have been alone
How long just how long
Can I endure this heartache tune?
It seems to disappear when you're here (and)

CHORUS
Maybe this time this could be love
Maybe this time she will stay here
With me tonight
REPEAT

SOLO

So I've got something new to say to you
In my life I have been alone
How long just how long
Can I endure this heartache tune?
It seems to disappear when you're here (and)

CHORUS
Maybe this time this could be love
Maybe this time she will stay here
With me tonight
REPEAT

Maybe this time
Maybe this time
Could it be love
Could it be love
(REPEAT AND FADE)
