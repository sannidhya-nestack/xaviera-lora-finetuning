BITTER MOON (TWILIGHT MIX)

He threw my love away                                              
And now I’m broken in two                                       
What can I do
He played a wicked game
That left me empty inside                                         
The tears that I’ve cried                                              

Baby you have shamed me
You took my heart, betrayed me
This fever burning so hot
Now I can’t stop
Sitting under the bitter moon

He led me down the path
Was that just part of a plan
Of a cold hearted man
They say forget the past
I wanna spend every day                                        
Making him pay                                         

Baby you have shamed me
You took my heart, betrayed me
This fever burning so hot
Now I can’t stop
Sitting under the bitter moon

And one day you will see
No one makes a fool of me
And even though I try, all this anger I can’t hide
The message I will send
Gonna get my sweet revenge
Soaking up the mood of the bitter moon
I’ll come for you soon                                            

You better believe it, it’s gonna be soon, you better believe it

Baby you have shamed me
You took my heart, betrayed me
This fever burning so hot
Now I can’t stop
Going under

Baby you have shamed me
You took my heart and played me
This fever burning so hot
Now I can’t stop
Sitting under the bitter moon
