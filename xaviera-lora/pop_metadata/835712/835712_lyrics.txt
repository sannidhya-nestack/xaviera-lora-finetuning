Extra Day 

(Verse)
I want to make a new day 
Between Tuesday and Wednesday
And bounce right out of the week
The clock would strike twelve, at last, 
And we’d steal away so fast
A day for just you and me
Just like our own private island
‘Cause I need hours with you to extend

(Chorus)
I want an extra day for you
I’d love to side step time, just us
We could slip off nice and smooth 
24 hours with my sweet crush
A new day for you

(Verse 2)
Feeling bright as a daisy
We’d show up on Wednesday
Without missing a beat
My heart would be fully fed
My thirst for you newly quenched
Our sweet secret to keep
I want to take you and withdraw
I want to pause the whole world because…

(bridge)
Our time is never enough
Let’s cross the date line and just run off
I need more you, but life just takes more me
Let’s jump into this opening 

(repeat chorus)
