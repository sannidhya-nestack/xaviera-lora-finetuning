[Verse]
In the sky so high above
Dreams and clouds all full of love
Violet flowers in the breeze
Whisper secrets
Through the trees

[Verse 2]
Twilight comes with purple hue
Stars come out
The night feels new
Mystery in every shade
Magic moments gently made

[Chorus]
What is violet
I wanna know
Colors dancing
Lights that glow
What is violet
Show me now
In the night
I'll take a bow

[Verse 3]
Candy skies at end of day
Sunset paints the world that way
Lavender and lilac too
Every hue is something new

[Verse 4]
In a dream where colors swirl
Violet takes me for a twirl
Fantasy in every tone
Violet moments all my own

[Bridge]
Can you see it
Feel the vibe
In the air
A quiet tribe
Shades of violet
Calm and true
All this magic
Just for you
