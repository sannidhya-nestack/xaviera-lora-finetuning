Love You No More

Woke up this morning to a bright new day
Feeling better since you went away
Can do what I want say what I wanted to say

You always had a different plan 
Always made me feel less of a man
You always did things I couldn’t understand

(Chorus)
That's why I'm not going to love you no more
And I'm not going to need you anymore

I could right see right thru your lies
I could tell by that look in your eyes
It got to the point nothing you said could surprise me

You always had a different plan 
Always made me feel less of a man
You always did things I couldn’t understand

What you did you did to hurt me
I was blind then and could not see
But now I am happy being who I want to be

You always had a different plan 
Always made me feel less of a man
You always did things I couldn’t understand
