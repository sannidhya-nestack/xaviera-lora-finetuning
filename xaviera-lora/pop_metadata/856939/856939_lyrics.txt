Tell Me Now
Why'd you leave me I got to know so tell me then just go
Don't look back won't see me no more
This last time just tell me don't say no
I will walk you to the door I will even drive you home
I need to know why you walked out of my life before
I gave you all that I had you left me so empty all alone
This last one time be nice make peace not like a war zone
Tell me now
Why'd you hurt me just please don't lie
Just tell me tell me why
Tell the truth look me in the eyes 
This last time just tell me I won't cry
I will walk you to the door I will even drive you home
I need to know why you walked out of my life before
I gave you all that I had you left me so empty all alone
This last one time be nice make peace not like a war zone
Tell me now
I will walk you to the door I will even drive you home
I need to know why you walked out of my life before
