Too many miles to your home
How can I make it on my own
Why does the road seem so long
How can I ever go on
So won't you stay here
Forever in my life
Another day here
Alone and I will cry

(chorus)
Cause I don't want to lose the one
Who's holding me tight in the night
I need you back into my life
If you stay maybe time
Can bring us back again
So you will be mine

This town ain't big enough for you
I know now but what can I do
You in that big city light
How can I live by your side
But I will be strong
And try to work it out
And though that he's wrong
I never had a doubt

(chorus)
Cause I don't want to lose the one
Who's holding me tight in the night
I need you back into my life
If I stay maybe time
Can bring us back again
So you will be mine

-instrumental-

If I can't stay there
I know that we will find
Another place where
We'll leave it all behind

(chorus)
Cause I don't want to lose the one
Who's holding me tight in the night
I need you back into my life
If we stay maybe time
Can bring us back again

Cause I don't want to lose the one
Oh if I stay maybe time
Can bring us back again

Cause I don't want to lose the one
Oh if I stay maybe time
Can bring us back again
And you will be mine
