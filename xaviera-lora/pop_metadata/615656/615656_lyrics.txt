The summer settles in
We’re driving around, windows are down, singing loud like theyre listening
How could you not want to stay?
When there’s nothing but love all around and the night’s as clear as day
The way you hold me up, the way you calm me down
The beating of your heart blends in with the sound of the ocean speaking words
You may call me crazy, but I believe what I heard

This is what it’s all about
So they say
And I’m finding out today
2X

The crisp air swings the sea
It swings the salt, it swings the sweet, it swings you into me
While we stay like this, it’s hard to believe anything else exists
They dance around us now, we’re in a different world, but we’ll get back somehow
I am here with you. as far as were concerned, this is what we’re meant to do

This is what it’s all about
So they say
And I’m finding out today
