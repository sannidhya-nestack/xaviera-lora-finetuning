She's the one and the only with you,
She's the cold in the night of the evergreen,
She'll never leave,
She's the shield that you carry to war,
She's the blade as it slices your enemies,
She's serenity,

Watch her dance with the moon and the stars,
Watch the fire burn from deep inside,
You know when she's on your side oh,

She's the breath on the crook of your neck,
She's the lover who enters your fantasies,
She's not a dream,
She's the mother you wanted to know,
She's the child that you watch, find her destiny,
Just make believe.
