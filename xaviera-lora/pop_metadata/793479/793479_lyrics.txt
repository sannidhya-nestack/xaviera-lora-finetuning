Trouble Everywhere

Heed the warnings, see the signs
Someone's sneaking up behind
Spreading rumors telling lies everywhere you go tonight

So don't waste your time
Best to get on with your life
Because there's someone spreading rumors everywhere you go tonight
Oh yeah there's someone telling rumors everywhere you go tonight

There's trouble everywhere
There's trouble everywhere
There's trouble everywhere
There's trouble everywhere
Trouble everywhere, trouble everywhere

You try do what  is right
open doors, act polite
where does it get you if no one sees the light?
They're always trying to fight you
trying to slight you
put you on defense when it makes no sense

You've gotta smile and look them in the eye
Don't let 'em get to you, don't let them make you cry
You know what you know
Walk away and say goodbye

There's trouble everywhere  (when you try to do what's right)
There's trouble everywhere (when you try to be polite)
There's trouble everywhere (they try to get you in the night)
There's trouble everywhere (nobody sees the light)
Trouble everywhere, trouble everywhere

There's trouble everywhere  (when you try to do what's right)
There's trouble everywhere (when you try to be polite)
There's trouble everywhere (they try to get you in the night)
There's trouble everywhere (nobody sees the light)

You try to do what's right...

You try to do what's right...

When you try to do what's right...
