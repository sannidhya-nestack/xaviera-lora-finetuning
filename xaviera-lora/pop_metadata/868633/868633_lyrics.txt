Right off my feet- Suchitra Lata

I like the way you talk to me with your eyes 
I like the way you sing to me with your smile 
You fit right into the spaces of my thoughts 
You fit right into the beats of my heart 

You walk me on your ground  now since you swept me right off my feet
You carry me on your soul now since you swept m    e right off my feet
You sway me around your life, since you swept me right off my feet
You dance me to the beats of your tune since you swept me right off my feet


I like the way you know what's going on with me
I like the way you hold my face when I'm so not me
You fit right into the spaces of my thoughts
You fit right into the beats of my heart now


You walk me on your ground now since you swept me right off my feet
You carry me on your soul now since you swept me right off my feet
You sway me around your life, since you swept me right off my feet
You dance me to the beats of your tune since you swept me right off my feet
