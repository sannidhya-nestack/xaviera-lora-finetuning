VERSE: 
I’m on the edge of a great, grand canyon
With my arms wide open, I’m ready to fly	
I’m gonna sail over that canyon
I am finally ready to say goodbye


CHORUS: 
Between the great, wide open
And the great unknown
There’s a bridge called ‘faith in me’
That will carry me home


VERSE:
I turn to you to wish you well
You’re no longer standing by my side
You’re walking backward from my arms wide open
And I watch you wipe away a tear from your eye


CHORUS: 
Between the great, wide open
And the great unknown
There’s a bridge called ‘faith in me’
That’s gonna carry me


VERSE:
As I fly over that canyon
I have no regrets and I will no longer cry
Because the distance that I will travel
Is already there between you and I 

CHORUS:
Between the great, wide open
And the great unknown
There’s a bridge called ‘faith in me’
That’ll carry me home
