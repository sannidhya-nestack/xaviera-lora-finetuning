Geary and vine

Geary and Vine
There's a lady there
She looks so fine
Every morning there
She passes by, I see her
Do anything to be there
As she makes her way
She makes my day

She looks so sweet
Like the sun she lights that city street
I approach her and I strike a conversation
But it's just my imagination
I'm tongue-tied at Geary and Vine

What could someone like her
Every see in a fool like me.....a delivery man
Driving the streets
Lugging the goods from my van

Geary and Vine
As close as her world ever gets to mine
I'm just dreamin 'cause I know that I'm not her type
She needs a man in pinstripes
Fancy shoes
Handsome and smooth

But I'll be OK
I can live for just that moment each day
When I see her there
A vision in the sunlight
I'm living for that one light
That I see down on Geary and Vine

Geary and Vine
I see my angel there at
Geary and Vine
