You said you loved me 
But I wasn't good enough 
You said you'd hold me 
But I just knew you'd run 
So many days without you 
So many tears I shed 
I'm stuck with a thought about you 
Remember what you said 

I try to find a reason, to move on with my life 
They tell me keep believing, but nothing seemed so right 
I can't believe a word you say 
Cause you ran and played your stupid games 

And now I face this world without you 
Remembering everything about you 

You said you loved me 
But I wasn't good enough 
You said you'd hold me 
But I just knew you'd run 
So many days without you 
So many tears I shed 
I'm stuck with a thought about you 
Remember what you said 

I try to find the meaning, of the things you said that night 
My heart keeps on bleeding, for such a pointless fight 
This is not how it's meant to be 
Cause you are the only one for me 

And now I face this world without you 
Remembering everything about you 

You said you loved me 
But I wasn't good enough 
You said you'd hold me 
But I just knew you'd run 
So many days without you 
So many tears I shed 
I'm stuck with a thought about you 
Remember what you said 

You said you would be there when I called 
You said you'll never go 
You said you would be there through it all 
You said you'll never go 

You said you loved me 
But I wasn't good enough 
You said you'd hold me 
But I just knew you'd run 
So many days without you 
So many tears I shed 
I'm stuck with a thought about you 
Remember what you said 

You said you loved me 
But I wasn't good enough 
You said you'd hold me 
But I just knew you'd run 
So many days without you 
So many tears I shed 
I'm stuck with a thought about you 
Remember what you said
