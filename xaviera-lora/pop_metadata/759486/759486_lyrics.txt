It

In a dark room 
I hear voices
They deceive me
And discourage me
It is here
I can feel it 
No one believes
That it exists

A stolen glance 
I’ll find you soon
And we’ll dance 
Till morning comes

My other part 
Is flying away
It’s a little bit hard 
But I’ll be ok
It’s not an airplane 
It’s something inside
I’d rather lead 
A lonely life

A stolen glance 
I’ll find u soon
And we’ll dance 
Till morning comes
