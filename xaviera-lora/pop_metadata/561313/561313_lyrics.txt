I couldn't help but notice that you were still alive on this earth
I couldn't help but notice that you were still amazing,
for what it's worth
I couldn't help but think that you had other plans
Than the ones that fell through
I couldn't help but wonder if you were wondering the same thing too

      If that was our rough draft, the one you always throw away
      If that was our last mistake, that we ever have to make
      Though we may crash and burn and be left alone
      And lonelier than before
      But just the chance to crash, and just the chance to burn
      Makes it all worthwhile

I couldn't help but think that you might love me after all these years
But I don't wanna know if you despise me for all these tears
And if I left no mystery unanswered then I apologize
But I can't help but think about all the history in our eyes

      If that was our rough draft, the one you always throw away
      If that was our last mistake, that we ever have to make
      Though we may crash and burn and be left alone
      And lonelier than before
      But just the chance to crash, and just the chance to burn
      Makes it all worthwhile

We never had a time that we could call ours
We never looked beyond the moon and the stars
We could never get it right, we never had the chance

      If that was our rough draft, the one you always throw away
      If that was our last mistake, that we ever have to make
      Though we may crash and burn and be left alone
      And lonelier than before
      But just the chance to crash, and just the chance to burn
      Makes it all worthwhile
