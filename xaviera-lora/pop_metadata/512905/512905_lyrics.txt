ALL MY LOVE TO YOU 

        Her name whispered soft in your sleep
        Says two now are three
        In your heart there’s a love burning deep
        But not for me

Chorus: All my love to you (I’m giving it every day)
        All my love to you (I’m throwing it all away)
        All my love to you (You-oo, giving it every day)
        Giving all my love to you (All my love)

        Your passion you try to disguise
        “Come closer,” you say
        But that far-away look in your eyes
        Gives you away

(Repeat Chorus)

        Why (Why….)
        Can’t you understand?
        My (My….)
        Heart is in your hands, oh no

        Tomorrow will never undo
        This pain in my heart
        Guess I’ll always be a fool for you
        I’ve been from the start

(Repeat Chorus)

        All my love to you (All my love)
        Oh…
        All my love (Giving all my love to you)
        All my love (Giving all my love to you)
        All my love (Giving all my love to you)
        All my love to you
