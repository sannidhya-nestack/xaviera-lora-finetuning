Dancing in a room on fire
Seems your eyes are blinding
You’re like a missile, so guided

Your skin is drenched with desire
A discount dopamine supplier
And I’m hooked, I’m your regular buyer

But at the first rays of sunlight
You’re gone like a thief in the night
And leave me broken on the floor, beggin’ for more and more and more

But you left a scar on my heart
Scar on my heart
And baby, I’m bleeding
When you’re leavin’
These exit wounds tear me apart

Scar on my heart
Scar on my heart
Tells me baby, I need ya
To heal me
To close the vein, you cut so hard
Scar on my heart
Hard,hard, hard. so hard, hard
You left a scar on my heart


I’m on top of your hit list
And I feel like a dazzled kid
Cause I’m fighting an urge I can’t resist

I know you’re not a liar
to tell the truth doesn’t get you higher
I’m caught between the fence and the wire

Cause at the first rays of sunlight
You’ll be gone like a thief in the night
And leave me broken on the floor, beggin for more and more and more

But you left a scar on my heart
Scar on my heart
And baby, I’m bleeding
When you’re leavin’
These exit wounds tear me apart

Scar on my heart
Scar on my heart
Tells me baby, I need ya
To heal me
To close the vein, you cut so hard
Scar on my heart
Hard,hard, hard. so hard, hard
You left a scar on my heart

Torn between pain and pleasure
Between feeling numb and a treasure
All I really need now
Is to know when we’re together

as addictive as your love is
It hurts so bad when we do split
SoI just cherish this dilemma
and hold on to this

scar on my heart
Scar on my heart
But you left a scar on my heart
Scar on my heart
And baby, I’m bleeding
When you’re leavin’
These exit wounds tear me apart

Scar on my heart
Scar on my heart
Tells me baby, I need ya
To heal me
To close the vein, you cut so hard
Scar on my heart
Hard,hard, hard. so hard, hard
You left a scar on my heart
