A moment’s glance
A silver scene
Hazy daydreams
Of where I want to be
A whispered secret
A soft refrain
A kiss as tender
As warm sweet summer rain

Sitting here
All fingers and thumbs
Waiting for my muse to come
Tip toe with me to the highest hill
The air is cool and so very still
I want to sleep in Italy
In Tuscan fields of gold and green
A gentle grace in the late day sun
To taste the vine
And know the day is done

Big sky country
The tallest trees
An empty canvas
For all my blues and greens
A new direction
Is what I need
A desert landscape
A different air to breathe.

Sitting here
All fingers and thumbs
Waiting for my inspiration
Walk with me to the highest hill
The air is cool and so very still
I want to sleep in Italy
In golden fields of Tuscany
A gentle grace in the late day sun
To taste the vine
And know the day is done

You lasted hard
Your plain routine
Such starvation cannot be seen
It’s not mean, I won’t hush
I’ll take it on to feel the rush

Sitting here
All fingers and thumbs
Waiting for my inspiration
Tip toe with me to the highest hill
The air is cool and so very still
I want to sleep in Italy
In golden fields of Tuscany
A gentle grace in the late day sun
To taste the vine
And know the day is done

Big sky country
The tallest trees

A moment’s glance
A silver scene
Hazy daydreams
Of where I want to be
Where I want to … be.
