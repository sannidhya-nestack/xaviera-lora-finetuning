I lay beneath the rubble of my life, 
     Yet I believe, I believe
That even though I used to take what’s mine and run,
    Love sets me free
God can help me,
But each day’s up to me

(Chorus)
And I’ll never be the person that I was again
And I’ll never live so blindly
Here’s where I begin, not where I end
And now I, declare myself redeemed

(verse 2)
I fell face down into this desperate time
     Yet still I breathe, still I breathe
And although I can barely face the way I lived,
    I look at me
And I see someone
Kinder I can be

(repeat chorus)
(bridge)

Grudges thrown out the window
I’ll clear some room to grow         
(repeat chorus, last 2 lines for tag)
