SOME DAYS EVERYTHING’S A MESS, 
THERE’S SO MUCH CLUTTER IN MY HEAD
SOME DAYS I CAN’T STAND THE RACE, 
I GET SO TIRED OF FEELIN’ THIS WAY
SOMETIMES I WANNA STAY IN BED, 
OR JUST GET AWAY INSTEAD
THERE’S NOTHIN’ IN THE WORLD THAT I WOULDN’T GIVE, 
TO BE FREE OF THAT LIFE, AND JUST LIVE.

FOR A BEAUTIFUL SUNRISE THAT DRIES MY TEARS 
AND THE SMELL OF COFFEE IN THE AIR.
I START SINGIN A TUNE AND I DON’T CARE WHO HEARS.
LIKE A DAY AT THE BEACH SPLASHING IN THE WAVES 
THE I WAY I FEEL WHEN I SEE YOUR FACE!  
IT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT GET ME THROUGH SOMEDAYS… SOME DAYS

SOME DAYS I JUST SCREAM, 
WATCH LIFE SLIP BY AIMLESSLY
SOME DAYS ARE CLOUDED BY THE RAIN, 
AND I WISH FOR A SUNNY DAY
SOMETIMES I SMILE INSTEAD OF FROWN, 
TRY NOT TO LET IT BRING ME DOWN
  
THERE’S NOTHIN’ IN THE WORLD THAT I WOULDN’T GIVE…
TO LET IT ALL-GO SO I CAN LIVE!
 
WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN’T GO ON, 
SING ALONG TO YOUR FAVORITE SONG
LIVE EVERY DAY LIKE IT’S YOUR LAST 
WE’RE ALL GOIN WAY TO FAST
BE IN THE MOMENT AND LIVE FOR TODAY, 
EACH MINUTE HAS SOMETHING TO SAY….
SO DANCE TO MUSIC WHEN YOU’RE ALONE,
LAUGH AT ALL THE SILLY JOKES  
SPEND TIME WITH FRIENDS WHO HELP YOU FIND YOUR WAY.   
IT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT GETCHA THROUGH THOSE DAYS…

LIKE THE BEAUTIFUL SUNRISE THAT DRIES MY TEARS, 
THE SMELL OF COFFEE IN THE AIR.   
I START SINGIN A TUNE AND I DON’T CARE WHO HEARS. 
LIKE A DAY AT THE BEACH WHEN THERE’S NO RAIN, 
THE WAY I FEEL WHEN I HEAR YOUR NAME!
 CUZ IT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT GET ME THROUGH SOME DAYS 

IT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT GETCHA THROUGH SOME DAYS, SOME DAYS
