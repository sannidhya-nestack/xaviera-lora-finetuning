you're only a dream away
by troy kline and stephen rice

troubles, they may come and go
they don't bother me, i know
you're only a dream away

and though we may be miles apart
when i sleep you're here, sweetheart
you're only a dream away

you're only a dream away
i can't wait to go to sleep today
and when i do, i'll be with you
and hope i wake to find my dream come true

one day you'll be coming back
until then i think i'll hit the sack
you're only a dream away
