Don't talk, just listen
Feel the bounce and roll
Don't frown, just bring it 
Don't ya know, don't ya know, don't ya know

Till the dawn, it's the shizzle
It's loud, no stroll
Get down, gotta give it
All ya own, all ya own, all ya own

When the 808's sound, make ya momma proud
It's the boom bam babel buzz
Livin' out loud, we're gonna break out
The boom bam babel buzz

I don't get a thang' bout what your sayin'
It's a boom bam babel buzz
Totally dig the way you're swayin'
To the boom bam babel buzz 
Till we're down for the count
And we're lost and found 
We're in this boom bam babel buzz
Around and around
Till we're upside down
In this boom bam babel buzz


Till the sun turns Crimson
Y'all lose all control
Hips go ballistic
don't ya know, don't ya know, don't ya know 

No words, just wisdom
No right, no wrong
Gotta Grind your ambition
All ya own, all ya own, all ya own

When the 808's sound, make ya momma proud
It's the boom bam babel buzz

I don't get a thang' bout what your sayin'
It's a boom bam babel buzz
Totally dig how you're swayin'
To the boom bam babel buzz 
Till we're down for the count
And we're lost and found 
We're in this boom bam babel buzz
Around and around
Till we're upside down
In this boom bam babel buzz

oh oh ho it's babel
boom Bah bam babel buzz 
oh oh ho it's babel
boom bam babel buzz

Till we're down for the count
And we're lost and found 
We're in this boom bam babel buzz
Around and around
Till we're upside down
In this boom bam babel buzz

No words, just wisdom
No right, no wrong
Gotta Grind your ambition
All ya own, all ya own, all ya own


I don't get a thang' bout what your sayin'
It's a boom bam babel buzz
Totally dig how you're swayin'
To the boom bam babel buzz 
Till we're down for the count
And we're lost and found 
We're in this boom bam babel buzz
Around and around
Till we're upside down
In this boom bam babel buzz

oh oh ho it's babel
boom Bah bam babel buzz 
oh oh ho it's babel
boom bam babel buzz

Till we're down for the count
And we're lost and found 
We're in this boom bam babel buzz
Around and around
Till we're upside down
In this boom bam babel buzz
