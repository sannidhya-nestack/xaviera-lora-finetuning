Verse 1:

She say love don't hurt
Don't you know I think about you every day? (everyday)
When you wake up i'm on your mind
please don't leave me behind
send me a pic...said "I miss you" (send me a pic..say i miss you)
I ain't got nobody else baby this you you (I ain't got nobody else baby this you, you)
If I was right there I would kiss you
Cause it's you and me when they gone away

Chorus:
I care less what they think
They don't know what we been through
They say what they wanna say
but it's you and me when they gone away
It's you and me when they gone away
Oh,

Verse 2:
Why you got the window down
and it's cold outside?
You won't speak...
and I don't know why...

Chorus:
I care less what they think
They don't know what we been through
They say what they wanna say
but it's you and me when they gone away
It's you and me when they gone away

Bridge:
Why you got the window down
and it's cold outside?
You won't speak...
and I don't know why...

Hey,Hey
