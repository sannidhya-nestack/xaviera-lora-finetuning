Oh, siren, how your voice is sweet!
What are you singing in the rocks?
Oh, siren, how your voice is sweet?
Who are you calling from the docks?


Through seas, the storms and winds above
That vanish your sadness down
Oh, siren, you're the bride of love,
Of demon who is always frown...


Oh, siren, song of you is sweet
In cloudless night of empty rock...
Oh, siren, demon you're, indeed,
You are my loving pleasure's stroke!
