She's always been True
But sometimes from a different angle
Keeping track of her instincts
Even on a road less traveled
A misfit any place or time
An outcast trying to tow the line
But she was True

Like believing in Jesus
Through the darkest hour
Stripped of all her possessions
Losing touch with that sacred power
Like Job when it could get no worse
Even when he thought he was cursed
He stayed True

Beauty breaks through the storm
Like a rose through decaying road
And everything she's ever known
Is worth nothing
Nothing
Without hope

Always fighting temptation
To settle for some heaven
A little piece of easy
A taste of that easy living
Pulls her, yet she turns away
She's gotta pay
To stay True
