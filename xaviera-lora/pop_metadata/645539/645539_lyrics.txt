a ton of roses by my door
you really think that i want more
i had my decent share of broken promises
i lay myself down on the floor

i feel the world is turning round
and i don't really need to push
was nice to see you now go home

i seal with a kiss
the perfect goodbye
moments like this
are hard to come by

don't tell me your name
i don't want to know
don't want you to stay
just kiss me and go

you hit me up when i am down
i turn my back to you and frown
i had my sorry share of patting on my head
i'm only up to go to bed

i feel the world is turning round
and i don't really need to push
was nice to see you now go home
