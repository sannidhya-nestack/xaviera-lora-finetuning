1st Verse: holding on to what you can, but don’t too tight you might end up, cutting off your loose ends, now don’t pretend you’re someone else, I know you’re thinking of yourself, it’s not if you can play it safe, you’re still gonna throw it all away

Chorus: if I walk and you run, you’re nothing but a runaway, I want you to stay, Why is it that, if I walk and you run, this just turns into a race, I want you stay here with me

2nd Verse: every dog can have its day, every man can have his ball and chain, to me it’s all the same, everything’s not a win or lose, why can’t we make our own rules, it’s not how well you play the game, it’s what you do along the way 

Bridge: can you make a change, not play it safe, can you struggle through this for my sake, or is the pain too much to take, can you make a change, not play it safe, can you say this to me face to face, I can’t wait for the day
