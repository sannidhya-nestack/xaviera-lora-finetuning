So Easy

(Verse 1)
It's so easy
It's so easy to love you
That's why I'll say it again
It's so easy
You're so simply delightful
Just irresistible, and
Each day is covered in rainbows of surprise
You woo me with the way you always satisfy

(Chorus)
Let's keep it rollin' 
Let's keep it goin' now
Let's keep it rollin'
Keep the love flowin' out
We couldn't be fresher
Together we win hands down

(instrumental chorus)
