End Of The Wire (David Harper & Ulla Lindstroem ©2012)

One step at a time
I’m walking the tightrope 
And I’m not gonna look down
Eyes straight ahead
The future’s before me
Just waiting to be found
I’m not sure what’s before me
But I must go

Moving backward, standing still
Is the fastest way to falling
And the sweat and blood and effort it’s gonna’ take
It will all pay off
It will be worth it
At the End of the wire

One dream  at a time
Exploring the unknown
Will take me to where I belong
Things as they are
May be working today
But tomorrow it may be wrong
Life’s too short to be settling
Take my hand
 
CHORUS

I strongly believe that anything is possible
And what I can dream I can do
This is my journey and what I will make of it
Depends on the things I let through

CHORUS
