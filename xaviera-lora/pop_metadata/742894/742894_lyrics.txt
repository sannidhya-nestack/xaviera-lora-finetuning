Verse 1

Whisper in silence
Secrets no one discovers
Relinquish your sorrow
Abandon all your mistakes

Pre Chorus

Runaway child 
Leave it all behind now
I can see your halo
In the night
Follow fate now
We will never break down
Walking on our own ground
In this life

Chorus

Runaway, now (x4)

Verse 2

Walking through shadows
Break down all of these walls
Conquer your battles
Exhale the poison inside

Pre Chorus

Runaway child 
Leave it all behind now
I can see your halo
In the night
Follow fate now
We will never break down
Walking on our own ground
In this life

Chorus

Runaway, now (x4)

Bridge

Find your own heartbeat
Wash away the pain
Find your own heartbeat
Take it all away
