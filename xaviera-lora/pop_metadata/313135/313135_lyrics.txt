Moo, Moo
Moo, Moo

Funky, funky, Funky Cow
Everybody wants to know how
Up in the air, down the stair
Everybody knows it’s a Funky Cow, Funky Cow, Funky Cow!
Welcome to Funky Town!

Where the cows make coca-cola (ah!)
And everybody isn’t sober (alright)
It’s a cow town, I said a cow town
No chickens allowed!

Moo, Moo
Moo, Moo

Funky, Funky, Funky Cow!
Funky, Funky, Funky Cow!

Where the cows make coca-cola (ah!)
And everybody isn’t sober (alright)

Moo, Moo (Ah!)

Up in the air, down the stair
Everybody knows it’s a Funky Cow, Funky Cow, Funky Cow!
Welcome to Funky Town!

Funky, Funky, Funky Cow!
Funky, Funky, Funky Cow!
