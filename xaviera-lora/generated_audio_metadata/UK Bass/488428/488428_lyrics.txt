I gotta go, you said I gotta go
There's nothing here to make me wanna stay
I need to know, you know I need to know
You wanna come with me and run away
If you wanna see another side of me
Then you better download the alchemy
If you wanna see another side of me
Then you better download the alchemy
I gotta go, you said I gotta go
There's nothing here to make me wanna stay
I need to know, you know I need to know
You wanna come with me and run away
If you wanna see another side of me
Then you better download the alchemy
If you wanna see another side of me
Then you better download the alternate
Me, what you want is in your hands and I don't know
Take it or leave it, just tell me, I need to know
I'm not forsaken, it's my turn and you should go
I want what you've got but you know I need to know
