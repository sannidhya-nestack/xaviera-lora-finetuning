But I got, but I got, but I got, but I got
The love of my life, and tonight
But I got, but I got, but I got
The love of my life, and tonight
Book a gut, book a gut, book a gut, book a gut
I have a, a, a, a, a, a, tonight
Book a gut, book a gut, book a gut, book a gut
I have a, a, a, a, a, a, tonight
I'm tonight
I'm tonight
I'm, I'm, I'm
(Wuh-Wuh-Wuh-Guh-Guh-Wuh-Guh-Guh)
