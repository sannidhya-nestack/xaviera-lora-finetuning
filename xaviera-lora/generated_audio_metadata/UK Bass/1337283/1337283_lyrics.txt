I know I'm not the only one
A crowd of hearts you've left behind
Do you smile when I fall for you?
Is it fun to watch from up above?
Tell me now, what's your game?
Why do you play with hearts that care?
I watched from afar, I looked up to you
But it feels like I don't even break through
Is it real or just a game you play?
Do you notice me or push me away?
I see the way you shine so bright
That doesn't mean what I think tonight
Do you laugh when I look your way
Or am I just another display
Tell me now what's your game
Why do you play with hearts that care
I watch from afar
I looked up to you
But it feels like I don't even break through
Is it real or just a game you play
Do you notice me or push me away
I thought you saw me, thought you cared
But now I'm wondering if you're aware
You've got me wrapped in your hands
Just tell me will you understand
I watched from afar, I looked up to you
But it feels like I don't even break through
Is it real or just a game you play?
Do you notice me or push me away?
