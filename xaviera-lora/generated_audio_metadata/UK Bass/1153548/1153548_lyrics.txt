'Cause nobody wants to be, I don't, I don't
nobody wants to be, I don't I don't
nobody wants to be, I don't
I don't
Cause nobody wants to be alone, alone
Cause nobody wants to be alone, alone
'Cause nobody wants to be, uh-oh, uh-oh
nobody wants to be, uh-oh, uh-oh
'Cause nobody wants to be at home, at home
nobody wants to be at home, at home
nobody wants to be at home, at home
I'm so blind but you're blind, I am, I am
