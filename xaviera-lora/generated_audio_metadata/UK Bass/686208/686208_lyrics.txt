Can't take my mind off of you
You're the lucky one
Don't leave me all alone
Don't leave me
Yeah
Yeah
(Dop, dop, dop, dop)
Can't take my mind off of you
You're the lucky one
Don't leave me all alone
Don't leave me
Can't, can't, can't, can't, can't (can't, can't, can't, can't)
Can't, can't, can't, can'nt, can't, can't (can't, can't, can't, can't)
Can't
Can't
Can't take my mind off of you
You're the lucky one
Don't leave me all alone
Don't leave me
