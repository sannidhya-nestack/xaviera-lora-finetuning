You always wonder what makes them tick
The size and the feet that you lick
But never for the people around you
Taking the pain as it comes through
So I stand here, song and lyric
Torn from the bones that I picked
And I'll watch you turn all your love
To the people you wish you could've done
Breaking backs for a living
Drinking two quarts of citine
Surprised I'm still standing
'Cause honestly my love you ain't of what's worth giving
it's saintly to your dainty eyes
Whining daily that you're not in their lives
Can you make me, make me, make me saintly too
A little torture to keep me sick
Part of your magic trick
And I gave up my half-hearted pretence
I know that you won't let my suffering end
And all I have is your voice
The promises, love for your bones
All I know is I'm saintly and deary
But only if the money starts to roll
Talking smack like you're Sinead
Never had a day's worth of willing
But the stories keep coming
As long as it's for your fault
you're silly to your dainty eyes
Whining daily that you're not in their lives
Silly when all they want is white lines
Don't bad mouth her because she's mean
she's mean but she's still my baby
It seems like little she does for me
She's mean but she's still my baby
Don't bad mouth her if she gets mean
Cause she's mean but she's still my baby
Don't say she want too much from me
Cause she's sweet and she's still my baby
Cause it's deadly in your daydream life
Kinda deadly cause you're not in their lives
They're not deadly
Open your eyes
all they want is my name
I say to me
To your dainty eyes
One and daily
That you're not in their lives
And you make me
Make me
Make me
Say to me too
