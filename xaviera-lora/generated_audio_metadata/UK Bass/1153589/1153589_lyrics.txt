Away in the sunshine, away in the seas
Away in the darkness where it's just you and me
Away in the sunshine, away in the seas
Away in the paradise where it's just you and me
With the sunshine or with the sea
I still get sand between my toes
Why can't we just go back to yesterday?
Were you the sunshine or were you the seas?
Were you the sun or were you the seas?
Away in the sunshine, away in the seas
Away in the sunshine, away in the sea
Away in a paradise where it's just you and me
