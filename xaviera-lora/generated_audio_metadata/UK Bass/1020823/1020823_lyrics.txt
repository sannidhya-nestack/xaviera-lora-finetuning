Love pain, love pain

Love pain love pain love pain love pain
Love pain love pain love pain love pain

Behind me
Sometimes I'm in the mood, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All the times feel a little different
Love pain, love pain
Love pain, love pain
Love pain, love pain
I'm down with sexist pain
Love pain, love pain
Love, love, love pain
Love pain, love pain
Love pain love pain love pain love pain love pain love love love pain
Big bad bad
It's such a waste
Ooh, what I have done
Love pain, love pain
Love pain, love pain
Love pain, love pain (I'm trying to stay sane)
Love pain, love pain (I'm trying to)
Love, love, love pain
Love pain, love pain (I'm trying to say)
Love pain, love pain (It's a game)
Love pain, love pain
Love pain love pain love love love pain
One mistake ruined my life and now I'm gonna have to find
A way that I can clear my mind ive myself move on and shine
Stop going over what I've done apologise and then move on
I'll accept your decision I'm sure you'll find I wasn't the one
I suppose I understand why you don't wanna be my man
But cheating wasn't in my plan it was just a stupid one night stand
Together we'd get through
But it's up to you boy
I said I'm sorry again and again and again
Love pain love pain
Love pain love pain
Love pain love pain
Love pain love pain
Love love love pain
Love pain love pain
Love pain love pain
Love pain, love pain
Love pain, love pain, love, love, love pain
Love pain, love pain, love, love, love pain
