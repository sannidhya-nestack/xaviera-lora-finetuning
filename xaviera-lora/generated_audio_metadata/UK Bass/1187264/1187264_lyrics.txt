Wake me, wake me up
Make it, make it stop
Feel it like a crime, say words were denied tonight
If would be never hurt, would be never killed at
To be with empty, I'd be quiet and free
I just want to feel something again, something again
Wake me, wake me up
Make it, make it stop
Feel it like a crime, say words will deny tonight
If we'd be never-hers
You would be never-gives
Feel inside
Turn around and leave
I'll be quiet and brave
I just want to feel
Something again
Something again
I don't know what it's like, but I don't know how to show it to you
