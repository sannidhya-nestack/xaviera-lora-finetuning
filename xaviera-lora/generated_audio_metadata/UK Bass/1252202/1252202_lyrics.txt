Dust in the air, noon break heat
Running wild on this concrete street
Eyes wide open, heart on fire
We find peace in the signal wire
Neon lights and hidden miles
Lost in dreams, shadows and smiles
Whispers loud in the urban night
Searching for a glimpse of life
Neon lights and hidden miles
Lost in dreams, shadows and smiles
Whispers loud in the urban night
Searching for a glimpse of light
Filter shelves are all on tight
In the chaos find what's right
In the pixel shades of grace
A new world for us to embrace
Cracks in the screen, voices call
Dancing shadows on the wall
We navigate through the digital flow
In this filter we grow
In love, reliefs, hearts on a ride
Through the signal, feel the guide
Hold my hand, don't lose the start
In this shelter, find our mark
Built a shelter, hold on tight
In the chaos, find what's right
In the pixel shades of grace
A new world for us to embrace
Electric beats, hearts on a ride
Through the signal, feel the guide
Hold my hand, don't lose the spark
In this shelter, find our mark
Filtered shelter, hold on tight
In the chaos, find what's right
In the pixel shades of grace
A new world for us to embrace
