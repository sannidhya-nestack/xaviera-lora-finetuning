I don't feel it
I don't feel it
I don't feel it
I don't feel it
I don't know, I don't know if I can be with my love (I don't know, I don't know if I can be with my love)
I don't know, (I don't know) I don't know if (I don't know if) (I don't know if) (I don't know if) (I can be with my love)
I don't know, (I don't know if) (I don't know if) (I can be with my love) (I don't know if) (I can be with my love) (I don't know if) (I can be with my love)
And beat it, my love
I don't get it
I don't get it
I don't get it
I don't get it
I know I can be with my doll (I know I can be with my doll)
I know I can be with my doll (I know I can be with my doll)
I know I can be with my doll (I know I can be with my doll)
I know I can be with my doll (I know I can be with my doll)
I know I can be with my doll (I know I can be with my doll)
I know I can be with my doll (I know I can be with my doll)
I know I can be with my doll (I know I can be with my doll)
Can't beat it, my love
Can't beat it, my love
