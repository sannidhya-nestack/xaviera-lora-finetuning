Can't you see
The look in me
The look of love in you
Can't you feel
It's not easy
Letting go
But you will never see me clearly
I will never hear you trying
I can't
You see the key
Look up love the moon
Can't get free
It's not easy
Let it go
You don't ever see me
See me
And I'll never hear you trying
Love, if I need it's meant to be
