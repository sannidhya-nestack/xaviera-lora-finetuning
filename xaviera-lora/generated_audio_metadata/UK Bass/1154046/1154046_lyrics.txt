We're losing our minds, blood and soul
Die, everything is riding when we go out every night
We're losing our minds, blood and soul
Everything is riding when we go out every night
We're losing our minds, blood and soul
Chasing after boys and then we fight
Drink until we die, yeah we might
Yeah we might die
Yeah we might, yeah we might die
Yeah we might, die
Yeah we might die
