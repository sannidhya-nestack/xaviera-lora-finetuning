He loved her shamelessly
She loved him equally
He loved her fearlessly
She joined him willingly
And so it began, a love that was banned, our lives to be damned, together they ran as one
They took every blow, each stone that was thrown, and faced the unknown, together exposed as one
And so it began, a love that was banned, our lives to be damned, together they ran as one
There's a country road, it's on Emma's throne
We'll face the unknown, together expose that one
Let's go
And so it began, a love that was banned
Their lives to be damned, together they ran and won
They took every blow, each stone that was thrown
And faced the unknown, together exposed and won
He loved her shamelessly
She loved him equally
He led her fearlessly
She joined him willingly
And so it began, a love that was banned
Their lives to be damned, together they ran as one
They took every blow, each stone that was thrown
And faced the unknown, together exposed as one
And so it began, a love that was banned, their lives to be damned, together they ran as one
Fates that could re-blow each stone that was thrown and face the unknown, together exposed as one
Let's go
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Let's go
He loved her shamelessly
She loved him equally
He
Led her fearlessly
She joined him willingly
He loved her shamelessly
She loved him equally
He
Let her fearlessly she joined him
