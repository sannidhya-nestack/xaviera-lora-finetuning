The night sleeps on the moon
The city wakes in the night
The road is lit with stars
The dark hides the sky
Let's catch up fall
Before the rise of the sun
Let's explore the meaning
Before the turning
Hit the highway
Hit the runway
Hit the dreamway
Let's just do away
Hit the highway
Hit the runway
Hit the dreamway
Let's just do away
The lights turned down
The music's turned up
The floor is lit up
Let's drop some bass down
Let's catch some fun
Before the rise of the sun
Let's explore the meaning
Before the turning
Hit the highway
Hit the runway
Hit the dreamway
Let's just do away
Hit the highway, hit the runway
Hit the greenway, let's just do away
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
