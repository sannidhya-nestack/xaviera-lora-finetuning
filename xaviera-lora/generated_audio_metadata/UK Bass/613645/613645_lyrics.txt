He died upon the tree but Babylon doesn't see her
He bore righteous souls and he died for the family her
They tried to think a book about the fear for your maker
He napped in another shell when they come to find a faker
Oh what's Judah hide when they come from the sky?
Then Babylon ran into the Lucifer the Bride
Salah said I know Yeshua ain't control
Israel come cause we want to go
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Dedicate with all the earth
They breed upon this earth
Elohim guiding trust
Spirits of the sun
The wisdom of Solomon
Gotta guide them with the gantamon
They like me weed
But Joshua come to free
Many youths beat the sea
our world and how we feel
Raps by Branson come
Vocal Tripoli
I and I play most ideas
And they fall on fire roots
Nothing come
Not I them me not gone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
King of kings, Lord of Lords
Come to dwell upon this world
In the Holy Word from God
These kids don't know run and fall
Aliens are falling one
Hypotheses at Babylon
And like the time in the world war
So shall there be in them all
Ancient things are turning true
We'll let the temple they prove
In the yard, out of yard
By blessing come in the jar
Prophecy complete the scroll
Reaping now nowhere to go
Time is now a revelation
Abomination of desolation
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
