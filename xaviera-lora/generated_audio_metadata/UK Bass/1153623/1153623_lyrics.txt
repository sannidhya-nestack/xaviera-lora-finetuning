Tonight's the night, I've been waiting all week for this (Are you ready?)
Do you like my shoes? Do you like my reference? (Do you like my shoes? Do you like my reference?)
Do you like my figure of this? (I've been waiting for all week for this)
Okay, let's do this (Are you ready?)
Do you like my shoes? Do you like my reference? (I've been waiting for all week for this)
I'm so pumped for it (Okay, let's do this)
But first of all, hang on, let me update my date, okay?
I'm so pumped for it
Tonight's the night and I've been waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Oh my god have you seen the price of my tweets?
Some hot guy named David just messaged me to want to come out
What should I say? What should I reply?
I don't want to sound too desperate but he is fit
Uh I'm here with my girls and we are ready to get going
Out tonight
We're going out tonight
We're going out tonight (tonight, tonight)
We're going out tonight (tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
Feels so right, we feel so right
Looking high tonight, we feel so right, feel so right
