Ooh, you, you stuck me, put me through
Don't you even realize I'm hung up on you
Made it cool, now I'm feeling like a fool
Should've swallowed my pride and drank up my wine and
Left you alone that night
I drank up my wine and left you alone that night
Left you alone that night
Left you alone that, left you alone that
You, the stuff you put me through
How'd you even realize I'm hung up on you?
Played it cool, now I'm feeling like a fool
I should've swallowed my pride, drank up my wine
Left you alone that night
You, the stuff you put me through
Don't you even realize I'm hung up on you
Made a fool, now I'm feeling like a fool
And I could swallow my pride, drank up my wine
Left you alone that night
Ooh, you, the stuff you put me through
Don't you even realize I'm hung up on you
Made it cool, now I'm feeling like a fool
Should've swallowed my pride and drank up my wine
And left you alone that night
I drank up my wine and left you alone that night
Left you alone that night
Left you alone that left you alone that
You used to put me through
How'd you even realize I'm hung up on you?
Played it cool, now I'm feeling like a fool
Should've swallowed my pride, drank up my wine and
Left you alone that night
Ooh, you, stuck me, put me through
Don't you even realize I'm hung up on you
Made it through, now I'm feeling like a fool
Should've swallowed my pride, drank up my wine
Left you alone that night
You, stuck me, put me through
How'd you even realize, I'm, I'm, I'm on you
Played it fool, now I'm feeling like a fool
Just swallowed my pride, drank up my wine
Left you alone that night
