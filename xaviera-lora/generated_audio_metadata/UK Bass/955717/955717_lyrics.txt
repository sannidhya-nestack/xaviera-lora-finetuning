Here I stand, feelings are strong
And silence is nowhere
Here I am surrounded in one
On fire like the sun
Sometimes we all fall down
Sometimes we all fall down
Sometimes we all fall down
Sometimes we all fall down (yeah, yeah)
Sometimes we all fall down
Here I stand, feelings are strong
And silence is nowhere
Sometimes we all fall down
Sometimes we all fall down
Sometimes we all fall down
Sometimes we all fall down
Sometimes we all fall down
