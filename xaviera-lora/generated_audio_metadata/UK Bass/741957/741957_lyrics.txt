Lost to the silence another of your doubts
Now I'm caught in blossom sound
Unfolding ground now
Looking at this town now
Unfolding ground now
Looking at this town now
I see you captured my heart
Traipsed and dispatched on my ache
Make my heart race at fast pace
Sit for a breeze
When I'm falling down
We're not falling down, we're not falling down,'cause we're made in Japan
Well you made a, better made in Japan
Well you made a, better made in Japan
I see you captured my heart shapes and it's fractured on my ache
Make my heart race at fast pace
Shift for a break
We're not falling down
We're not falling down
We're not falling down
we're made in Japan
When you say you don't stand a waiting good man
When you say you don't stand a waiting good man
Not a man to go
When you say don't
Then I'll say it ain't just that
On your fatal, on your fatal, on your fatal, on your fatal
On your fatal, fatal, fatal, fatal, fatal, fatal
