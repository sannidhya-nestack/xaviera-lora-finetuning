Set me free
I'm on this love
When the sun goes down tonight
Tell me one thing on my mind
One thing on my mind
One to discover
Set me free
I'm on mission
Led by only intuition
When the sun goes down tonight
There'll be one thing on my mind
One thing on my mind
Na na
I'm on mission
And when I come around, I'm only down lowly
It is the way things have gone manifest
Life where we live is like a game of chess
Make the wrong move and you end up in a mess
Life then would be worthless, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Be as, be as, be as, be as, be as
Be as, be as, be as, be as, be as
Be as, be as, be as, be, be as
Be there
Want me on my mind
Set me free, I'm on this night alone
When the sun goes down tonight
There'll be one thing on my mind
One thing on my mind
Set me free, I'm on a mission
Led by only intuition
When the sun goes down tonight
There's one thing on my mind
One thing on my mind
Wicked and way things a gone manifest
Life where we live is like a game of chess
Make the wrong move and yet end up in a mess
Life then would be worthless, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes
Be there!
