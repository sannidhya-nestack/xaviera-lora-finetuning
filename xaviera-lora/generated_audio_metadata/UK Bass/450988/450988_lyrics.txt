Garage waves that flop across the screen
Ten thousand strong hit the dance floor
Once more we swept the dance floor
Water poured through open doors
Nomadic beats are flooded
Memories came caught in
Experience stronger than they seem at the time
But it bothers the lip slip
Flip lids like jewels in mountains
Morning missed the system
Hard to give itself over
To what we need to proceed
To what we need, to probe, to see
To what we need, to probe, to see
To what we need, to probe, to see
Over itself gives just mind for instance
Miss morning mountains of a jewel like the lids
Flip slip lip like
That butters it for time at the seam they land stronger experience
Camp called memories applauded beats nomadic to doors open through the pause water dance
The sweat we more once and floor dance they hit the strong thousands hand streamed across
Flip waves garage top let the unwrap as I as I unwrap the laptop carriage flows
Once more we sweep the dance floor and pause through the open doors
Two nomadic beats are plotted memories can't quarter the experience
Stronger than they seem at the time but it butters the lip
Flip slip lids like mountain jewels morning
Mr. Sister mind to give itself over
To what we need to proceed
To what we need to proceed
To what we need to proceed
To what we need
To proceed (I can feel it) (Can you feel it?) (I can feel it) (Can you feel it?)
Oh can't you feel it, can't you feel it, come on
Oh can't you feel it, can't you feel it, come on
Oh can't you feel it, can't you feel it, come on
Oh can't you feel it, can't you feel, can't you feel, it's wet drip
Everybody on the back, yes, do that flip
Oh keep it a cup in the back, from the front to the back, non-stop
Let me see you bouncing to your booty once I drop
Come on and bring it, can't you, can't you feel it, can't you feel it, come on
Oh can't you feel it, can't you feel it, can't you feel it, come on
Oh can't you feel it, can't you feel it, can't you feel it, come on
Can't you feel it, can't you feel it
Can't you feel it, can't you feel it, can't you feel it
Black and white can you hear it?
The king and the king can you hear it?
Black and white can you hear it?
The king and the king can you hear it?
Black and white can you hear it?
I can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it, can you feel it?
I can feel it, can you feel it?
I can feel it, can you feel it?
