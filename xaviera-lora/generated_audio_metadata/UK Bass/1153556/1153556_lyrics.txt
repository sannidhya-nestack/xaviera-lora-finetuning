The best I'll do is promise you we'll have some fun before we grow
The best I'll do is promise you I'll have some fun before we grow
And as time spreads open
I love you.
The best I'll do is promise you I'll have some fun before we throw
The best I'll do is promise you I'll have some fun before we throw

It's still fun to be, it's still fun to be, it's still fun to be, it's still fun to be, it's still fun to be, it's still fun to be, it's still fun to be, it's still fun to be, it's still fun to be, it's still fun to be, it's still fun to be, it's still fun to be
