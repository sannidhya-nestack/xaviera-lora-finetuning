To never let you be alone
But you can do it to the gutter, the gutter
The constellation's pretty nice
But I can't get the help it's gotta, it's gotta, yeah
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, yeah
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, yeah
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, yeah
Daddy can never let you be alone
Daddy, daddy, you
Daddy, daddy, daddy
Daddy, daddy, daddy, you
You
You
You
You
You
You
Get, get, get, get it, get it, get it
You never want to be alone
But you can do it together, together
The constellations paradise
And I can get the harvest coming, it's coming
You, got it, got, got, got it, got it
You, got it, got, got, got it, got it
You, got it, got, got, got, got it
Got it, you, got it
You're never gonna leave me alone
Got it, got it, you
Got, got, got it
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
