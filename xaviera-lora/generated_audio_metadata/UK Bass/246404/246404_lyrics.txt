And hey ya, and hey ya, and hey ya
Da dum day, dum da dum day
And hey ya, and hey ya, and heyya
Da dum day, dum da dum day
And hey ya
Get in touch with happiness
You'll see the light in your eyes
It's hard enough to understand (understand)
For your love wrote my hand
Now the well has turned into a spore
Feeling alone
I feel the love
And when you're alone, get somebody
Somebody who cares, you feel the beat, get in motion
And when you're lonesome, get yourself
You take care, you feel the beat, get in motion
Wondering what we have done
Till dawn has come
Time has disappeared in your smile
Hold on for a while
Now the wind has turned into snow
I'm still feeling alone
Feeling alone
And when you look at somebody
Somebody cares
You feel the beacon in motion
And when you're lonesome, get yourself
You take care, you feel the beacon in motion
And when you long at somebody
Somebody who cares
You feel the beat get emotional
And when you're lonesome get yourself
You take care you feel the beat get emotional
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Get in touch with happiness (get in touch with happiness)
You'll see the light in your eyes
It's hard enough to understand
Feel love hold my hand
Wondering what we have done
Till dawn has come
Time has disappeared in your smile
Hold on for a while
Now the wind has turned into storm
Feeling alone
I feel alone
And when you look at somebody
Somebody who cares
You feel the beat get in motion
And when you're lonesome like yourself
You take it
You feel the beat get in motion
And when you're lonely got somebody
Somebody who cares
You feel the beat get emotional
And when you're lonesome got yourself
You take care
You feel the beat get emotional
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya
