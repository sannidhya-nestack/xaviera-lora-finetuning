Represent, represent
Everybody scream
Represent, represent
I check one two one two uh

To any vibes through the microphone boom boom
I do what I want to
What the hell you gonna do?
Everybody scream
My check one two one two uh

To anybody I'm straight a microphone boom boom
I do what I want to what the hell you gon' do?
Everybody scream
I represent this is what I do to anybody through the microphone boom boom boom
I do what I want to what the hell you gon' do
Everybody scream
City slick I know the streets know the rules flip the game
Nightmare pimpin' lane spittin' flames switchin' lane
Knock'em out the box knock'em right out the picture man
Dialogue went drop so hard it might split your brain
My check one two one two uh

To anybimes through the microphone boom boom

Everybody scream
City slick I know the streets

Switchin' lanes knock him out the box
Knock him right out the picture man
Dialogue won't drop so hard it might split your pain
