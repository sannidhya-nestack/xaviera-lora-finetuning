It's just a way of making money
There's no need to stick around
When you're feeling down
You can tell me that you love me
There's no need to stick around
I don't like
I'm only here for a moment I would normally pass around
When I'm feeling down
I will tell you that I love you just before I put you down
Don't let life pass by
Don't let
Lie
Pass by
Don't let
Life has fun when I'm feeling down
I will tell you that I love you just before I put you down
