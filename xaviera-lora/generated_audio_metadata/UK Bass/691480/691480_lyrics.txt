You were the one for me I lost you
You said goodbye and walked away
I gave you everything you wanted
You know I'm pleading you to stay
But somehow I
Don't feel like crying
Don't feel like crying
Although you left me there alone
I'm better off without you darling
And now I can handle on my own
I'm better than yesterday
I'm better than yesterday
But somehow I
Don't feel like crying
Don't feel like crying
Although you left me there alone
I'm better off without you darling
Than I can handle on my own
I'm better than yesterday
I'm better than yesterday
