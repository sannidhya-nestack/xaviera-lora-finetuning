Let's go!
Here we go!
Everybody wait a minute
Let's go!
Here we go
Everybody wait a minute
Now where you from, where you at, what you wanna do
The good times, the fast life, what you goin' through
What's your name, where you from, bottom of the map
Man here on your test, can't go through you like a CAT scan
I owe you, nah you owe me
Everything you learned, you got from the OG
Everything I've gave you, mostly for free
And now you wanna act like you don't know me
Don't you know it's so cold in the T
Lost your fake friends, now you're so lonely
Tellin' on your crew, snitchin' on your homie
A girl spread out all my metal like she a trophy
Thought you got away, thought you were home free
But I'm back, now your eyes close so slowly
I move quickly, you so sickly
Bubblegum rapper, you so wiggly
Now where you from, where you at, what you wanna do
The good times are fast like what you goin' through
What's your name, where you from, buy a mother map
Man here on your test can't go through you like a CAT scan
I owe you, nah you owe me
Everything you learned you got from the OG
Everything I gave you mostly for free
And now you wanna act like you don't know me
Don't you know it's so cold in the T
Lost your fake friends now you're so lonely
Tellin' on your crew's nation I'm your homie
A girl spread out on my mantle like she a trophy
Thought you got away, thought you were home free
But I'm back, now your eyes closed on slowly
I move quickly, you so sickly
Bubblegum rapper you so riddle
Let's go
Everybody wait a minute
Everybody wait a minute
Bricks on spinning this wheel
Rubber gold squeal when the Michelin's peel
Too many fake cats looking for a deal
When will they learn that they don't appeal?
Everybody wait a minute
Everybody wait a minute
