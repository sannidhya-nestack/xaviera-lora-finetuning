Won't you fill my heart with joy
Can you feel my love for you
Won't you fill my heart with joy
Can you feel my love for you
Won't you fill my heart with joy?
Can you feel my love for you?
Won't you fill my heart with joy
Can you feel my love for you
Get the fuck out of my house, get the fuck out of my house
Get the fuck out of my house, get the fuck out of my house
Get the fuck out of my house, get the fuck out of my house
Get the fuck out of my house, get the fuck out of my house
Won't you fill my heart with joy? Can you feel my love for you?
Won't you fill my heart with joy? Can you feel my love for you?
Won't you fill my heart with joy
Can you feel my love for you
Won't you fill my heart with joy
Can you feel my love for you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
It's all my fault, it's all my fault
It's all my fault, it's all my fault
It's all my fault, it's all my fault
