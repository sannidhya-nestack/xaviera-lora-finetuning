All around us we can see the joy of love too
And I know that you are so happy with me
But all I want to say
And all I want to feel is my love, is my love, is my love for you
All around us we can see the joy of love too
And I know that you're so happy with me
And all I want to say
And all I want to feel is my love, is my love, is my love for you
All around us we can see the joy of love too
And I know that you're so happily with me
And all I want to feel is my love, is my love, my love for you
Oh,'cause we can't see the truth
And I know that you
