Ooh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gold walls that I built for you
Just to dig me out with silver spoons
No, I didn't see it coming, oh
Cold walls and I'm stuck inside
I guess beauty sees what I can't find
I didn't, no I didn't see it coming
Well I got your call and I got your message
I want you to know that you are the love of my life
The love of my life
You never leave when the song is over
You ride or die'til the end
You're the love of my life
You're the love of my life
My life, alright
Alright
My life, alright
Oh, my life, oh
Gold walls that I built for you
Just to dig me out with silver spoons
No I didn't see it coming, oh
Cold walls and I'm stuck inside
I guess beauty sees what I can't find
I didn't, no I didn't see it coming
Well I got your call then I got your message
I want you to know that you are the love of my life
The love of my life
You never leave when the song is over
You ride or die'til the end
You're the love of my life
You're the love of my life
My life, alright
Alright
My life, alright
Alright, my life, alright
