Feel your lungs and you close your eyes
Ask the moon to return the tide
Liquid blue meets the endless sky
In between the place for you and I
Feel your lungs and you close your eyes
Ask the moon to return the tide
Liquid blue meets the endless sky
In between the place for you and I
Watch us warm, running down your skin
Where yours ends and where mine begins
Where we are, the way it's always been
Paradigm, I see it in your frame
