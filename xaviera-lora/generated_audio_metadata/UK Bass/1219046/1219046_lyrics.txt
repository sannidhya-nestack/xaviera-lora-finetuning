Don't you feel your hand in the blue flame
I think you like it like it like it when your skin breaks
Do you feel the weight of a bullet chain
Dragging behind you
Don't you feel your hand in the blue flame
I think you like it like it like it when your skin breaks
Do you feel the weight of a bullet chain
Dragging behind you
Don't you feel your hand in my blue vein
I think you like it like it like it when your skin breaks
Do you feel the weight of the bullet chain
Dragging behind you
Don't you feel your hand in my blue vein
I think you like it like it like it when your skin breaks
Do you feel the weight of the bullet chain
Dragging behind you
Don't you feel your hand in my blue flame
I think you like it like it like it when your skin breaks
Do you feel the weight of your bullet chain
Dragging behind you
Don't you feel your hand in my blue flame
I think you like it like it like it when your skin breaks
Do you feel the weight of your bullet chain
Dragging behind you
Don't you feel your hand in the blue flame
I think you like it like it like it when your skin breaks
Do you feel the weight of a bullet chain
Dragging behind you
Don't you feel your hand in the blue flame
I think you like it like it like it when your skin breaks
Do you feel the weight of a bullet chain
Dragging behind you
Don't you feel your hand in the blue flame
I think you like it like it like it when your skin breaks
Do you feel the weight of the bullet chain
Dragging behind you
Don't you feel your hand in the blue flame
I think you like it like it like it when your skin breaks
Do you feel the weight of the bullet chain
Dragging behind you
Don't you feel your hand in my blue flame
I think you like it like it like it when your skin breaks
Do you feel the weight of a bullet chain
Dragging behind you
Don't you feel your hand in my blue flame
I think you like it like it like it when your skin breaks
Do you feel the weight of a bullet chain
Dragging behind you
