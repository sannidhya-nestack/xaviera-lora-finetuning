Listen my boy, we've got the style and fashion in the place
Wrecking it down to the hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, same

Pray

Trenton is the new style
So I'm going to leave you now, I'm going to leave you now
Listen my boy, we've got the style and fashion in the place
Raking it down to the hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, scene
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Fame
Transcendence the new style

Transcend is the new style
