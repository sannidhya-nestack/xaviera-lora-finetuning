Standing in the rain, by the dawn, in my brain
Always doing silly things, just to make you look at me
Thought I might make it, but I might try again
If I let myself live, it's a possibility
How did I ever see you again? Or is this the end? I don't know
Standing in the rain, by the dawn, in my brain
Always doing silly things, just to make you look, at me
In the clear red and blue, yeah I tell the truth, there is nothing to lose, well
Already gone and it's like so, it's best that I be home, you told me where to go
In the clear red and blue, yeah I tell the truth, there is nothing to lose, well
Already gone and it's like so, it's best that I be home, I'll leave you to it now
Jungle in the rain, feel the dawn, April rain
How much time I'll still have days just to make you look at me
I don't want to get out but I might try again
If I let my life slip away, it's a possibility
I don't know if I'll see it again, or if it's just the end, I don't know
Standing in the rain, feeling down in my brain
I was doing silly things just to make you laugh now
In between red and blue, yeah, I tell the truth
Those in the darkness were already gone
It's like salt, but still I'll be home, you taught me a lot, girl
In between red and blue, yeah, I tell the truth
Those in the darkness were already gone
It's like salt, but still I'll be home, I'll never tell you now
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
You look at me, I'm so lonely
Accept the reality
Accept the reality
Accept the reality
