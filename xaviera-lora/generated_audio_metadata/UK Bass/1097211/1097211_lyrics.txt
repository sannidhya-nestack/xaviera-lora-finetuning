Water crashing in the night
Water run from my eyes
Don't follow me into the dark
You'll faint, our heart will break
Water washing me dry
That's why I need you, I need you
Tonight, that's why I need you
I need you
Tonight, that's why I need you
I need you tonight
That's why I need you
I need you tonight
Would I just leave me high?
I ride on the changing tides
Would I drown tonight?
This might be our last goodbye
So I need you
Oh God, I need you, I need you tonight
Save your life and stay with me (Save your life, I'm ready)
Watch the tears
So I just need you, I need you tonight
That's why I need you, I need you tonight
That's why I need you
That's why I need you, I need you tonight, you tonight
