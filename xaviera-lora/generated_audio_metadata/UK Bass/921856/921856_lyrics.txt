Love
Sometimes I see you watching over me
Sometimes
Sometimes
I always think of you in the bright lights
I always love you when the moon shines
Always
Sometimes I et to tell you you're the only one (always)
I always know there is no one else, no one
I don't know how to tell you what I wanna tell you now
But it's amazing to feel your loving all around
Sometimes I see you watching over me
It makes me wanna shout, let it out
Tell the world what it's all about
Couldn't tell myself inside out
Love so deep wanna bring it out
I feel so good there ain't no doubt
This kind of love I can't live without
You keep it on and on it never stops
I'll always talk of your love
Till the very day I drop
Sometimes I feel you all around me
When I'm alone
I think of you when I'm happy
So come rain or shine
Don't make me feel so blind
I know you're watching me
I always feel your love sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
I always think of you with the bright lights
I always love you when the moon shines
Always
Sometimes I see you watching over me
Sometimes I et to tell you you're the only one
Always
I always know there is no one else
Your one
Always
Took took took took took took
I'm really not sure
Don't even feel so blind
I know you're watching me
I always feel your love sometimes
