I said this world is something to find
If only I could see with these two eyes
I said this world is something to find
If only I could see with these two eyes
When he came and told me that he loved this world
Same colors that he sees in his dreams
I said this world is something to live to find
If only I could see with these two eyes
Same colors that he sees in his dreams
Same colors that he sees in his dreams
If only I could see with these two eyes
Same colors that he sees in his dreams
But for me I could see with these two eyes
I said this world is something meant to find
But for me I could see with these two eyes
I said this world is something meant to find
I said this world is something meant to find
If only I could see with these two eyes
I said this world is something to find
If only I could see with these two eyes
I said this world is something to live about
If only I could see with these two eyes
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like, I like, I like, I like, like, I like, I like, I like
