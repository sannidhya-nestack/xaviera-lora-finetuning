Set me free from all this solitude that I've taken
Me apart
Me apart
Set me free from all this uptune
Set me free from all this uptune
Be in the past
Be in the past
Set me free from all this solitude
That tears me apart
Can you imagine if I were a star?
Fly away if I were a star
Set me free from all this solitude
