Who are you talking to
When you're calling out my name
Who are you thinking of
When you're laying next to me
Who are you feeling on
When your hand's upon my chest
And who are you loving
When you're looking to your left
Who are you waiting for
When you're sitting by yourself
And who are you tasting
When my lips are by themselves
Who are you looking at
When you look into my eyes
What are you thinking
Do you think it's just a lie
I don't want to be left behind
Thinking to myself I'm not the one
I can start to see that there's a sign
Who will you be with when I'm not around
What are you thinking?
What are you feeling?
Who are you touching?
Who are you loving?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
I don't wanna be left behind
Thinking to myself I'm not the one
I can start to see that there are signs
Who will you be?
When I'm not around
