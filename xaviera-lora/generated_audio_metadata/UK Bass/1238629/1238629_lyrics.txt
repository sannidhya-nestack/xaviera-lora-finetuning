Yo, let's walk about love, let's talk about peace
In a world full of hate, we need a release
From the streets to the streets, it's all the same
We're all searching for love, playing life's game
We need brothers and sisters standing side by side
Know the vision, let's push aside the pride
It's not just about gender, it's about unity
Together we're stronger, that's the community
It's stronger, that's the community
Yo, big brothers and sisters, stand side by side
The world division, let's push aside with pride
It's not just about gender, it's about unity
Together we're stronger, that's the community
Yo, listen up, let me speak my mind
Loving is about what you leave behind
It's about what you give, how you lend a hand
Supporting each other is the master plan
From the block to the boardroom we gotta spread love
Not just for ladies, but for all of us brats
It's not weak to show care, it's a sign of strength
We gotta lift each other up to any length
Where is the love?
It's right here in our hearts
Let's tear down the walls, let's break apart
The barriers that divide, let's build a bridge
Between every gender, every colour and every creed
