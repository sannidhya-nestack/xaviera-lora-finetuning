I wish that I was there
I will fight on
I'm breaking out of this negative energy
Hey, I'm moving on
I've had enough
To move myself from this negative energy
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'm a she, I'm a she, I'm a she
I'm moving on, I'm heading, I'm heading
Removing myself from this negative energy
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Say goodbye, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
