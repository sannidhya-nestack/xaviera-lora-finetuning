(I can't believe I fell in love)
Everywhere that I go, everything that I do
I will always be, always be around
Everywhere that I go
Everywhere that I go, everything that I do
I will always be, always be around
Everywhere that I go, everything that I do
I will always be, always be around
You know, you know
You know, you know
Everywhere that I go
Everywhere that I go
Everything that I do
I will always be
Always be around
