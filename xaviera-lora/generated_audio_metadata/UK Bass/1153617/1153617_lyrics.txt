I never meant for you to leave this way
Still I et to say
We never meant to be, we never meant to be
Still not the same, still not the same, still not the same, still not the same, still not the same, still not the same, still not the same, still not the same, still not the same, still not the same, still not the same, still not the same, still not the same, still not the same, still not the same, still not the same, still not the same, still not the same, still not the same I never meant for you I never meant for you I never meant for you I never meant for you I never meant for you
I never meant for you to leave this way
Still I et to say no
