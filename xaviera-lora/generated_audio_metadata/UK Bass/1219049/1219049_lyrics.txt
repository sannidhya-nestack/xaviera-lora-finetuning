Love you when you look to me
I love you when you touch me
Ooh baby
Ooh baby
Love you when you look to me
I love you when you touching up on my body
All over my body
Love you when you look to me
I love you when you touch me
Ooh baby
Ooh, ooh, baby
I love it when you look to me
I, I love it when you're touchin' up on my body
But over my body
Love it when you look to me
I love it when you're touching me
Ooh baby
Ooh baby
I love it when you look to me
I love it when you're touching up on my body
All over my body
Love it when you look to me
I love it when you're touching me
Ooh baby
Ooh, ooh, baby
I love you when you're listening to me
I love you when you're touching up on my body
But over my body
So, I'm going to go ahead and do that.
