Lion from the tribe of Judah
Uno ready for the boys and girls in the smoke
Ever living ever faithful ever sure every time
So this is piracy don't go lion session
Big on piracy uno rock it round the world
From coast to coast
And across the pond (Hailing out the kings who we are)
Giving thanks and praises (Come on, come on, we're not ready)
Sample the rhythm and now sit down, panic
the lyrics sound so nice so you must come write it
And if you're here, well, you surely can't miss
The time is now for youth promotion
You're not ready for no separation
Living in a ghetto so you must have a plan
Jah Jah come soon, VidCon, take his children
Level up the vibes and I'll solve your problem (Light it up)
Light it up!
Sample the rhythm and I sit down,
Panic'cause the lyrics are so nice,
So you must come write it
And if you're here, well, you surely can't miss
The time is now for youth promotion,
You're not ready for no separation
Living in the ghetto, so you must have a plan
Jah Jah come soon, fi come take his children
Level up the vibes and I'll solve your problem
Light it up!
No! No!
