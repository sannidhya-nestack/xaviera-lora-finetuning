Never thought I'd feel like this so close
So near, never thought I'd fly so high
Above the sky
Fly so high
Above the sky
Fly (I feel the beat come down on me, yeah)
(I feel the vibe surrounding me, yeah)
(I feel the beat come down on me, yeah)
Never thought I'd feel, feel like you, feel, feel like you
Vision
(Feel the vibe surroundin' me, feel the beat come down on me, yeah)
(Feel the vibe surroundin' me, feel the beat come down on me, yeah)
I never thought I'd feel, feel like this, feel, feel like this
Beauty
Ugh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Love
Love
