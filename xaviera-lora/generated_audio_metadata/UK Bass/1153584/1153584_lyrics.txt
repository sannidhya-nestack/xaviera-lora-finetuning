So many years have passed now
And my heart still beats for you
You can only say now
What it is I leave to you
And the heartbeat kicks in
The times I've been around
And I can only see, only see the love that you have
So many days have passed now
And my heart still beats for you
You can only say now
What it is I mean to you
And the heartbeat kicks in
Drums are real loud
And I can only see you, only see you
So maybe there's another true love
