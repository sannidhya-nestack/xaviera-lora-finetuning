I'm you, I'm you, I'm you, I'm all of you
I'm you, I'm, I'm you, I'm, I'm you
I loved you
I'm you, I'm, I'm you I, I'm you
I loved you
From the very first heartbeat
And so we started
When our eyes were open
I thought I knew love
my heart was broken
I'm giving in, I'm giving out
Gonna live my life without you
I'm giving in, I'm giving out
Not gonna say it's all about you
And so we started when our eyes were open
I thought I knew love'til my heart was broken
I'm giving it, I'm giving it
Gonna live my life without you
I'm giving it, I'm giving it
Not gotta say it's all about you
I'm giving in
I'm giving out
Gonna live my life without you
I'm giving in
I'm giving out
Not gotta say it's all about you
