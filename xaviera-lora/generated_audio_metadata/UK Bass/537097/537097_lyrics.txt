Daylight
Better bad boy, better fancy
All the master of them deadly
If you my friend or enemy
All the master of the place come find me
Now listen to the music, minding the flow
What we gonna do right about now is make the people rock roll rock roll
Night night, night night, daylight
The light starts in the night
The light
Better buy boy, better fancy
All the bars so rough and deadly
If you're my friend or enemy
All the mascot in the place come in front of me
Now listen to the music, minding the flow
What we're gonna do right about now is make you people rap-roll, rap-roll
Lai Lai Lai Lai Lai Lai Lai
Night, night, daylight
Delight, delight
Delight, delight
Delight, delight
Delight, delight
Delight, delight
Delight, delight
Delight, delight
Delight, delight
They lie
They lie, they lie
They lie, they lie
They lie
