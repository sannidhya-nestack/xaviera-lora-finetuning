I need you
I need you
I feel the groove
Come on
Ain't no wrong
Let your hair down
Go on, make me feel it baby
They ain't goin' around
Go on, go on
They ain't goin' around
They ain't goin' around
Be, be, be, be
Come on
Let it go
Let it go
Head down
Things don't work around me
Things don't work around me
I need you
I need you
I
