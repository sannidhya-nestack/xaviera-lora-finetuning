I'm gonna do whatever I want
And even sky is no limit for me
I'm gonna do whatever I want
And even sky is no limit for me
I'm gonna do whatever I want
And even sky is no limit for me
I'm gonna do whatever I want
And even sky is no limit for me
I'm gonna do whatever I want, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm gonna do whatever I want, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm gonna do whatever I want
And if the sky's the limit for me
I'm gonna do whatever I want
And if the sky's the limit for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm gonna do whatever I want
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm gonna do whatever I want
Ooh, ooh, ooh
