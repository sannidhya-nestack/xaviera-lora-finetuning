You've got a way of making me feel small
But I won't let your words reach me anymore
Thought you knew all that there was to know
Thought you'd landed the final blow
Rise up now
Rise up now
Rise up now, rise up now, rise up now
You've got a way of making me feel small
But I won't let your words reach me anymore
Thought you knew all that there was to know
Thought you'd landed the final blow
Rise up now
Rise up now
Rise up now
Rise up now
Rise up now
Rise up now
