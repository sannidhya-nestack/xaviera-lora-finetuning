All around the street, can you see me?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I want you all to know
All around us we can see the joy of laughter
And I know that you're all happy with me
But I want to say
And all I want you to feel is my love, is my love, is my love for you
All around us we can see the joy of love too
And I know that you're so happy with me
And all I want to say
And all I want to feel is my love, is my love, is my love for you
All around us we can see the joy of love too
And I know that you are now happily with me
And all I want to see
All I want to feel is my love, is my love, my love for you
All of us, we can't see the joy left to
End our image
