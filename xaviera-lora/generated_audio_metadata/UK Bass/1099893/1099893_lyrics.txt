Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hear me calling, my love crawling
I can keep you safe (I can keep you safe)
Take my power, borrow fire
I can keep the chase, I can go wild
Keep running, running, running to where you are (to where you are)
Oh I'll keep running, running, running near or far (running)
And if you wander like me, on another galaxy
Then I'll keep running (I'll keep running)
Oh I'll keep running (I'll keep running) into the stars (running, running, running)
Into the stars (running, running, running)
Running, running, running, running, running, running, running
I'll lay down all my cards for your heart
Don't let this be the end before the start
Hear me calling, my love crawling
I can keep you safe (I can keep you safe)
Take my power, borrow fire
I can keep the chase, I can go wild
Keep on running, running, running
To where you are, to where you are
I'll keep running, running, running near or far
And if you wander like me
Home in another galaxy then I'll keep running (I'll keep running)
I'll keep running (into the stars)
Running, running, running
Running, running, yeah
