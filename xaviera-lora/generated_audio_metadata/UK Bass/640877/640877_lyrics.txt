I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting for much longer
They're waiting to end the song
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I sit around, I bored as hell
It's not my turn, oh well, oh well
I didn't want to come in here
Another end, seems nowhere near
My nerves are wrecked, my back is cracked
I need to move, I cannot sit
I wanna go, I need to quit
I'm resting here, I'm tired of shit
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
Come on don't hesitate
Don't drag this thing out more
In it now, stop it here and now (stop it now)
Gotta end it now, ooh-wee, ooh-wee
Gotta end it now
I sit around, I'm bored as hell
It's not my turn, oh well, oh well
I didn't want to come in here
And now the end seems nowhere near
My nerves are wrecked, my back is cracked
I need to move, I cannot sit
I wanna go, I need to quit
I'm resting here, I'm tired of shit
I've been waiting
I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting
I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
I sit around, I'm bored as hell
It's not my turn, oh well, oh well
I didn't want to come in here
And now the end seems nowhere near
My nerves are wrecked, my back is cracked
I need to move, I cannot sit
I wanna go, I need to quit
I'm resting here, I'm tired as shit
I've been waiting
I've been waiting for much too long
There a way to end this all
I've been waiting for much too long
There a way to end this all
I've been waiting for so long (I've been waiting)
Is there a way to end this suffering?
Is there a way to stop this endless wait?
Is there a way before it will be too late?
Before it will be too late
Come on don't hesitate
End it now, stop it
End it now, stop it
You've gotta end it now
You've gotta end it now
You've gotta end it now
Come on stop it (oh yeah)
End it now, come on stop it (uh huh)
You've got to end it
Now
