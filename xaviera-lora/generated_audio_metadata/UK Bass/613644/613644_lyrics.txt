He died upon the tree but Babylon doesn't fear
Me poor righteous souls need to follow family
He tried to change the book but the fear of fire made God
In no canine and I like to come they gonna find no faker
Rough Judah high not come from the sky
Heavy Babylon running sending Lucifer goodbye
Salafi I know Yeshua in control
Israel come cause we are to go home
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Meditate with holy herbs, they read about his word
Elohim, G-d, they trust me, they saw this heard
The wisdom of Solomon, God of God, the God of man
They love me, we, but Yeshua got to be
And the youth we defeat'cause of what I now we see
Rast, my praise to God, book of Jubilee
I and I, praise Mosiah, set my soul on fire
Fruit that is gone, he that hide it, me that run
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
King of kings, lord of lords
Come to dwell upon this world
It's a holy world for God
He keeps on the run and far
Aliens are all at once
Lost to sea and Babylon
Back to time I know a war
So shall it be anymore
Ancient dead turn to truth
We'll end this devil and fool
It's a yard, not a job
My brothers should come in the jar
Run for sea, read the rules
We've been out of where to go
I'm a slave
Revelation, ominous, the desolation, oh
Move! Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Move! Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Move! Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
