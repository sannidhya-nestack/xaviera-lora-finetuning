Tossed to your intricate web of lies
Your words amaze, a clever disguise
Once a fool for you, blinded by your art
But now I see the truth, mending this broken heart
All time trapped in your game
Deceived by love, it's never the same
Your manipulative always a dangerous flame
Leaving scars of betrayal, I won't be the same
Whispers of promises shattered like glass
I danced in your shadows now I'll surpass
Your spell broke illusions fade away
No longer a puppet I'll find my own way
All time chump but a role I outgrew
Emerging stronger begging farewell to you
No longer entangled in your deceiving loop
I break free ready to regroup
Echoes of memories fading in the night
I rise above, ready to take flight
No longer confined but by your toxic hold
Embracing my world, shining dawn
All time shown, a chapter closed
From the ashes, history imposed
Who on earth said that the earth can be strong?
I think we're claiming our song
Echoes of memories fading in the night
I rise above, ready to take flight
No longer confined by your toxic hold
Embracing my world, shining gold
Hold on, jump a chapter close
From the ashes, a new story imposed
No longer tethered to your jumpy stroll
I break free, claiming mine my soul
