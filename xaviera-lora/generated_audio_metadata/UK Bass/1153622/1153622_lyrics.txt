Every day, every time, every place, every night, every day, every hour
Every day, every time, every place, every night
Every day, every hour, blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away
Now that you're gone, I won't say it aloud
I cannot breathe when you're not around
I still want you, I know you
Who can you see standing here blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away
