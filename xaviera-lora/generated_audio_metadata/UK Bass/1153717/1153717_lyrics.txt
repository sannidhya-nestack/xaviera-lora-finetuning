I saw you in a dream again
You look at me and smile
I'm happy like a child
You're building my mind again
Time to stop
Oh, I don't want her to wake up
Getting closer, closer to me
Tell me if you're blowing roses
Roses in my chest
My lips
Only one kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss
Only one kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss
Are you miss miss miss miss miss miss miss miss me
Only one kiss
Only one kiss
I need
Only one kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Only one kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Are you miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, missing me?
Only one kiss, only one kiss
Only
