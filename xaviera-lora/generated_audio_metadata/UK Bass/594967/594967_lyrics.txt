Looking on my better side
Over my shoulder
Don't look over your shoulder
It's creeping up behind
You're reaping the world
You're reaping the reward
What you have been told, girl
Looking at me high
Shake it
Indication left side
You're creeping and reaping the signs that you wanna be born
You got the flow shit
The crypto system at the mouth
Check it out
Jack, Jack, Big B
Yeah
