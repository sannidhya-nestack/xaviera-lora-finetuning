Would you know when I'm done
Autumn is coming, please tell me, but it's too late
Oh, it's too late
Would you know when I'm coming back
Can I wake you up then
Just to hear you
Just to hear you
She would have told you how I love her
She would have told you what I need tonight
Would you know when I'm down
Oh Tommy's here, this done me mad it's too late
Oh it's too late
I dream of you again last night
Oh I know you'd have found the word just for me now
Just for me now
She would have told you how I love her
She would have told you what I need tonight
She would have told you how she loved me
She would have told you what I need tonight
What I need tonight
She would have told you how she loved me
She would have told you what I need tonight
She would have told you how she loved me
She would have told you what I need tonight
What I need tonight
