With cornice on hillside steeper where anxious storms near
Urging waves kiss rocky shores as time slowly creeps
Into the glass-folding wall, on zookey strings they sing
Of love's lost and found again in the endless creation's dream
Oh my Aegean home
Where the gloom meets the storm
In your arms I will always roam
Never to feel alone
Fishing boats at dawn set sail
While waters coming deep
While in the village square above the eldest sinner's king
Young lama steel and low-melt spats beneath the lemon trees
As the scent of wild iron breath drifts upon the waves
Oh my Aegean home where the blue meets the snow
In your arms I'll always roam, never to feel alone
From Olympus to the sea, this land of gods and men
As weathered times relentless march, to rise and shine again
When the sun sinks in the west and stars begin to glow
The sounds of sweet bouzouki fill the air down below
So raise your glass of ozone to this land of myth and might
For in the heart of Greece, my friends, will glance away the night
Oh, my Egeo
Where the moon meets the snow
In your arms I will always roam
Never to feel alone
