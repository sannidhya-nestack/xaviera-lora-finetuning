Roads, roads, roads
Of the dead marches come alone
Roads, roads, roads
Roads on the shore of the fate
Life, oh life
All the streets are full of life
Life, oh life
Of depression drugs through the night
But if you say it's alright
Tomorrow is gonna die
And if you say it's okay
Our blue sky will turn to grey
But if you stand behind
All the stars will fall to one
And then you'll see, my friend
That things won't change again
Street, cold street, where every different dies
Behind us, sealed, kill us an afterlife
Eyes, many eyes, with tears like a river of fire
Pull us high to an endless and glorious sky
But if you say it's alright
Tomorrow is gonna die
And if you say it's okay
Our blue sky will turn to grey
But if you stand
Behind all the stars will fall to one
And then you'll see, my friend
The things won't change again
But if you say it's alright
Tomorrow is gonna die
And if you say it's okay
Our blue sky will turn to grey
But if you stand behind
All the stars will fall to one
And then you see, my friend
The things won't change again
