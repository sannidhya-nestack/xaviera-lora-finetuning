Jerusalem is calling, my heart and all my soul
The city of my yearning, the place I call my home
Jerusalem, my treasure, a heritage so old
A brisk and thriving culture that's bright and warm and bold
From the dome and the old city to the mount and to the wall
The spirit flows inside me like rain that needs to fall
From the market to the gardens and the streets that welcome all
Jerusalem is calling Jerusalem stand tall
Jerusalem, my homeland
Speak soft, but loud and strong
Where people come together
The place where I belong
A place for all religions
To pray in solemn tones
For all the many peoples
To gather not alone
With a voice as bright as sunshine
With a sound so fresh and clear
Jerusalem is calling to all from far and near
With a voice as bright as sunshine, with a sound so fresh and clear
Jerusalem is calling to all from far and near
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
With a voice as bright as sunshine
With a sound so fresh and clear
Jerusalem is calling
To oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
From far and near
Jerusalem
