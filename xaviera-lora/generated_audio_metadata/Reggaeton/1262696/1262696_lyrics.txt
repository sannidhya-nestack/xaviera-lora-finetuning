A tropical rhythm in the midnight air
Feel the beat, let it take you there
A fiery dance, an enchanting dance
Step in closer, you have the chance
Dance with me under the neon lights
Move to the rhythm throughout the night
With every beat, passions on the rise
Two bodies in rhythm, no time for goodbyes
The salty whispers and the tropical breeze
Feels so right, makes me feel at ease
I move synchronized to the rhythm of love
Underneath the starlit heavens above
Move with me through the rhythm and the heat
Nothing can contest our synchronous beat
Feel the surge, the melody of the night
Savour the moment in the soft moonlight
Our hearts beat in unison just as they're meant
To the rhythm, pulse, love sentiment
Hold me close in your strong embrace
Lost in the rhythm, lovely chase
Dance my love to the break of dawn
A rhythm so sweet, a bond so strong
Under the tropical moon feeling so right
Be my love under the neon lights
Just fade slowly with the break of day
