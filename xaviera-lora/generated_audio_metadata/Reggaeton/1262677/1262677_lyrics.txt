Oh, oh, oh
Heat touchdown on a golden sand
Underneath the sky so green
We'll see a breeze whispering tales on this tropical night
Love prevails, get the rhythm in our souls
In our hearts music unfolds
Passion's flame burning bright
In your eyes I find the light
Dance with me another moonlight
Body to body feeling so right
In the rhythm we sway we play
In this tropical paradise we stay
Taste the salt in the air with each whisper pull me near
Underneath countless stars your love heals all my scars
Got the rhythm in our souls in our hearts music unfolds
Your laughter is my song with you I feel so strong
Dance with me under the moonlight body to body feeling so right
In the rhythm we sway we play in this tropical paradise we stay
Feel the music, feel the beat
