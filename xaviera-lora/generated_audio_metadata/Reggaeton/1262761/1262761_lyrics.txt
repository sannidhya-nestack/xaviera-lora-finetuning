Midnight city, shining bright
Gotta be a music and flight
Her eyes sparkle in neon light
Just like a star
In the lonely night, glow in the dance
Caught in the moment, in the trance
In this game of romance
Give me a chance, enhance this circumstance
Leave it all behind, come sway with me
Dancing under the starlight, as free as we could be
In this city of dreams, this city by the sea
We're creating memories, just you and me
Crazy rhythm, feel the heat
With the pulse of the city, to this beat
The night's young and sweet
Underneath the stars where our gaze meets
Leave it all behind, come sway with me
Dancing under the starlight, as free as we could be
In this city of dreams, this city by the sea
We're creating memories, just you and me
As the city sleeps and the moons in flight
With the rhythm of our hearts we ignite
City of dreams holding us tight
In this dance of love we reunite
