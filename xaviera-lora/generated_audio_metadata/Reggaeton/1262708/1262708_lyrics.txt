On the street, it's a fire with the rising sun
Your dance, your rhythm, got my heart on the run
Eyes of desire, skin glowing bronze
Under the city lights, plays our little dance
In the night, we move to the beat, so sweet
The pulsating rhythm where two bodies meet
Under the moonlit ocean within a crowded night
Lost in the music under the neon lights
With your whispers of love intoxicating stare
A moment suspended in the tropical air
Your life's drowning in, in the dancing breeze
In the rhythm of the night, we dance with ease
And we sway, to the rhythm, under the starlit sky
In the heart of the city, where the echoes lie
Our bodies moving, in perfect harmony
Beneath the sparkle skyline, by the sapphire sea
The music is our language, the dance for our world
In the rhythm of the night, love is unfurled
Between the beats and the silence, in the pulsating heat
We find our rhythm, we're too hard speed
So we dance under the stars in the balmy breeze
In the rhythm of love we move with ease
In this other paradise on this tropical night
In the heart of the city under the neon lights
