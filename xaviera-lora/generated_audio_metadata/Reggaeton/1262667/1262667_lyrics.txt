Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
You're like the rhythm that does the beat against the clay
Underneath the starlight where we danced the night away
Tropical whispers flooding in the warm sea breeze
Underneath the moonlight you were dancing close to me
Our hearts beat faster in the heat of passions glow
In the rhythm of the night we're never letting go
Sipping on tequila with the taste of salt and lime
This ain't just a feeling it's the rhythm of the time
Just you and me in this tropical paradise
Unleashing the rhythm under the velvet skies
Through the solitary nights where the music never sleeps
This is our melody where palm meets record beats
Your seductive smile burning brighter than the sun
Your hips don't lie, they speak the languages of fun (languages of fun)
Body in motion, lost in your hypnotic eyes (eyes)
It's our own ocean, under those sparkling skies (sparkling skies)
Just you and me, in this dance floor paradise (paradise)
Unleashing the rhythm, where passion never dies (never dies)
Through the sultry nights where the music's bittersweet
This is our song where pop meets reggae beats
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Starry night, our bodies intertwined
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
This is our story written in every line
Just you and me under the moon's dreamy light
In our tropical paradise as we dance through the night
Where the nightlife thrives and the music's on repeat
This is where we live where pop meets reggae beats
As we sway with the rhythm under the moon's embrace
