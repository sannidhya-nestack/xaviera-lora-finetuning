Feeling the rhythm, feeling the vibe
And I know don't language mistake or write
We've got the music, we've got the night
With the power to stir up the light
We're dancing in the moonlight
Turning our head around
Our bodies swaying with the beat
Moving without a sound
Come close, it's moving time
et your troubles, mind this is the night
You'll make it right, in the rhythm we're gonna drown
Out here in the street lights
Under the starlight gleam
Our love is like a fever, hotter than it's ever been
No matter the distance, no matter the tide
In the rhythm of the night, love won't hide
So let's dance under the twinkle
With a sparkle in our eyes
No conversation needed, our heartbeats suffice
Together in the rhythm
Lost in the night's design, this is the night
We'll get it right with every beat we intertwine
Oh, under the night sky
As the city goes to rest
Our dance is still ongoing
Beating with our chests with every move, every sway
Leaving all behind
In the rhythm of the night, our soul is refried
So let's dance, don't let this moment slide
In the rhythm of the night there's nothing we need to hide
There's magic in the air as we dance through the divine
Tonight's the night, we'll make it right
In the rhythm we will shine
So let's say goodbyes, turning our heads around
Our bodies sway with the beat moving without a sound
Come close, let's move inside
et your troubles, mind this is the night
We'll make it right, in the rhythm we're gonna jump
