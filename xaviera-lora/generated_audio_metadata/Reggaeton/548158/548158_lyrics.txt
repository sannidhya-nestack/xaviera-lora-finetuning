'Cause this ain't no love song (ain't no love song)
this ain't no celebration, no, no, no
this ain't no love song (aint no love song)
if there ain't no tribulation, just
But take what you see (take what you see)
And all that you feel (and all that you feel)
And eventually it's real
this ain't no love song (ain't no love song)
'Cause this ain't no celebration, no, no, no
this ain't no love song, ain't no love song
if there ain't no tribulation, just
Take what you see, take what you see
And I'll let you feel, and I'll let you feel
And eventually it's real
I've taken it down
Followed it through
I passed the ground
To love you
Well this ain't no love song (ain't no love song)
This ain't no celebration, no, no, no
'Cause this ain't no love song (ain't no love song)
if there ain't no tribulation, just
Take what you see (take what you see)
And I'll let you feel (I'll let you feel)
And eventually it's real
Well this ain't no love song
Well this ain't no celebration
