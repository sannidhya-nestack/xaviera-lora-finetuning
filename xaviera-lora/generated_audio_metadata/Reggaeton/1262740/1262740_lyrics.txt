Underneath the neon lights where the rhythm takes the night
Moving close, body swaying and love's the only sign
With every beat, oh how sweet tangled up in heat
Spinning around on the reggaeton streets
Burning like a summer sun, a story's just begun
In the light of the reggaeton, your love's never done
With every pulse, every tone beneath the silver moon
Just you and me, a wild symphony
In the heart of our dancing room
Wrapped in the tropic breeze, dancing by the Caribbean seas
Whispered words of a sweet decree, dancing to our own decree
Every beat, every strum, rhythm calling us to come
In the island heat, we move our feet to the reggaeton drum
Caught in the afterglow where the nighttime shadows flow
We'll keep dancing till the morning sun where time moves slow
Pulses racing skin on skin
One intoxicating spin
You and me in pop melody
Swept in the reggae dumps in
So here we sway
Lost in the rhythm spray
Loving through the night and day
In the world of the pop reggaeton play
So here we sway, lost in the rhythm spray
Loving through the night and day
In the world of the pop reggaeton play
Burning like the summer sun, our story's just begun
In the light of the reggaeton, we're loves never done
With every pulse, every tone
