In between the big and large we found paradise
Underneath the neon skies got lost in your eyes
Got a taste of the night lips touch feeling right
Bring the rhythm of the tide under that moonlight
Dancing in the rhythm ocean as I fall
We move like the waves always wanting more
We're caught in a dance
Feeling so profound
With a reggaeton beat
We're losing ground
Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
That electric vibe
Is sparking you and me
Feel the heat, the heartbeat
Music in the air
We're one with the rhythm
Without a care
Chancing in the rhythm, ocean as our floor
We move like the waves always wanting more
We're caught in a dance, feeling so profound
With the reggaeton beat, we're losing ground
Bodies intertwine, pulsating to the groove
With a pop of rhythm, we smoothly move
To the rhythm of love, to the beat of the drums
In this melody of night, our story begun
We're dancing'til the sun rise,'til the night becomes the day
