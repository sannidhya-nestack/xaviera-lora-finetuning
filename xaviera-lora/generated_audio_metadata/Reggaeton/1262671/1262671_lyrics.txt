Shimmering lights, balmy nights
You and me, taking flight
Swaying palms, whispering breeze
Caught up in the summer tease
You walk in, got that swagger
Heart beats fast, starts to stagger
Tanned skin, captivating eyes
Got me hooked, no compromise
We're dancing, we're dancing under the neon glow
Rhythm takes us, shaking up to the tempo
Songs repeat, your touch so sweet
In this moment, our hearts meet
Shining stars, in genuine light
Lost in you, such a beautiful sight
You're more than my vivacious smile
Swept away, let's lose track of time
Rough punch, taste of the sea
Stealing glances, it's plain to see
You grew my fair blood in the soul tree air
No words spoken, don't need no solitaire
We're dancing, we're dancing under the neon glow
Rhythm takes us, shaking up to the tempo
Soul tree beats, your touch so sweet
In this moment, our hearts meet
When the night reigns and the music fades
Your choice remains and my heart it beats
This balmy dance under the night sky
In your arms I found my hide
Where does the wisdom that's so tricky
Dance in the way our eyelids retreat?
Oh-oh-oh, we're dancing, dancing under the neon glow (neon glow)
Rhythm takes us, shaking up to the tempo (to the tempo)
Soft repeats, your touch so sweet (so sweet)
In this moment, our hearts meet
