Under the heat of a midnight sauna
With you with'em I'm never done
Your eyes they go like city lights
And your arms I found my nightlife
Gotta keep on dancing
No time for romancing
This beat's entrancing
It's how we keep surviving
The world is swaying in rhythm with the tide
In the echo of the night
We got nowhere to hide
Whisper words mean nothing, let the beat confide
In this dance with you, I'll forever apply
Just keep on moving
Under the moon's glazing
The melody's so soothing
It keeps our hearts racing
Underneath the stars we find our midnight sun
No water just beats this dance has only just begun
Keep this rhythm flowing let the music keep growing
In this dance of life it's the only truth we're knowing
Our bodies swaying in a rhythm with falter
With every beat our bond only grows stronger
This is our song, the melody's so tender
In the dance of nights, it's a moment to remember
Two bodies swaying in rhythm with the tide
In the echo of the night we got nowhere to hide
Whispered words mean nothing, let the beat confide
In this dance with you, I'll forever abide
Just keep on moving, under the moon's blazing
The melody's so soothing, it keeps our hearts blazing
Underneath the stars we find our midnight sun
No words just beats, the dance has only just begun
Long beneath the swans we find our midnight sun
No words just beats this dance has only just begun
Keep this rhythm flowing let the music keep growing
In this dance of life it's the only truth we're knowing
As dawn breaks our steps never falter
With every beat our bond only grows fonder
This is our song, our melody's so tender
In the dance of nights, it's a moment to remember
