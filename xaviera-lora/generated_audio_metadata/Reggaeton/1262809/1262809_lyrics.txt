Hey, my darling, I'm this a-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo
Dancing to a rhythm, as sweet as a fine tune
Your silhouette sways in the faint glow
I get lost in the rhythm of your soul's echo
Body's moving in the snow tree
Your every move knocks me off my feet
In the tropical beat, we lose control
Our bodies talking in ways words cannot console
Gazing into your eyes, sparkling bright
In this melody, I find my light
This rhythm speaks a language of its own
In this warm embrace, our love has grown
With the tropical beat, we dance the night away
Every moment a poetic ballet
In the midst of the pulse and the drum's toll
Finding each other is our only goal
With the tropical beat of the night
Your smile is my guiding light
With rhythmic pulses making the time stall
In this dance my darling we have it all
We sway to the rhythm under the lunar bell (lunar bell)
Our silhouettes casting shadows, oh
In the rhythm and the heat of the night
Lost in each other it feels so right
As the melody fades with the dawn's embrace
See the world in your softened gaze
This rhythm, my love, is our song
It's neat, we find where we truly belong
Gazing into your eyes, sparkling bright
In this melody, I find my light
This rhythm speaks a language of its own
And it's worn embrace, our love has grown
With a tropical beat, we dance the night away
Every movement a poetic ballet
In the midst of a ghost in the drum store
Finding each other is our only goal
With a tropical beat, we dance the night away
Every movement a poetic ballet
And this rhythm speaks a language of its own
And it's beat defined where we truly belong
