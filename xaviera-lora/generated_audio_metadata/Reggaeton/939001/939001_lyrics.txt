Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Box it out of mine
I know a little place where we can do some drinkin'
Ah, tambe, tequila, and boda
I know a little place where we can do some partyin'
Ah, just take me south of the border
Border, border, border, border, border, border, border
Border, border, border, border, border, border, border
Every morning, every evening
Every day just a normal routine and
Paradiso, but I don't need it
Little south of the border kinda healing
Little chica in tequila
Teeny bikinis looking movi benita
Dame un beso, mas la vita
Si pala un poco, si mamacita (oh yeah)
Su boca en la mia
Ya no puedo mas
Oh we oh here we go
Oh we oh down below
We got all night
We can take it fast or slow
Puedo pasar la noche contigo
Just watch the 405
Turn into freeway in 5
Top down I come out alive
Venga
I know a little place where we can do some drinkin' (ah)
Dame tequila y boda
I know a little place where we can do some partyin' (ah)
Just take me south of the border (border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border)
We can heat up San Diego
Cross the border drink some beer
Pasarás la noche conmigo
Down here there's beauty I see
Every day a sunny paradise
And every night we party to the light
And every day a sunny paradise (Give me that sticky love)
And every night we party to the light
Watch the 405 turn into freeway 5
Top down I come alive, venga
All week we been locked down
Grinding for the crown
Go spread our wings right now, venga
I know a little place where we can do some drinkin' (ah)
Dame tequila y boda (ah)
I know a little place where we can do some partying (ah)
Just take me south of the border (border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border, border)
Just take me south of the border (border, border, border, border, border, border)
Just take me south of the border
I know a little place where we can do some drinking
Just take me south of the border
