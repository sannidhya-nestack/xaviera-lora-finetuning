Karenda metamata to the shining sun
Feet in the sand where the light has begun
Your eyes meet mine
Reflect in the eous rain
In this vibrant night while the dance fades away
Headlights on, driving down the coastal line
Feeling the pulse, you and me in time
With the drops of tequila and hence the lime
We lose ourselves in a dance so fine
You and I, dancing through the night
Underneath the stars, oh what a sight
Caught in a beat, our hearts start to race
In the dance of passion we find our place
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Your body to the rhythm
So beautiful, so fine
Our dreams wash up with the incoming tide
For the lights are low, but the sparks fly high
Under the moonlight, with love that's amplified
You and I, driving down the coastal line
Feeling the pulse, you and me in time
With the drops of tequila and hints of wine
We lose ourselves in a dance so fine
You and I, dancing through the night
Underneath the stars, oh what a sight
Caught in the beat, our hearts start to race
In the dance of passion we find our place
You and I, dancing through the night
Underneath the stars, oh what a sight
Caught in the beat of the heart'til the melodies trace
This dance is ours setting a new pace
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
You and I, the place
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Your body to the rhythm, so beautiful, so fine (so fine)
Our dreams wash up with the incoming tide
I wanna start to wave the lights so low
But to start to race in the dance of passion we find our place
Our place
You and I, dancing through the night
Underneath the stars, oh what a sight
Caught in the beat, our hearts start to race
In the dance of passion, we find our place
You body to the rhythm, so beautiful, so fine
Oh beautiful, so fine
Our dreams wash up with the incoming tide
With the incoming tide
The lights are low, but the sparks fly high
In the dance of passion we find our place, our place
To the rhythm of the love we sway
Till the break of a brand new day
With every note we start to say
This is where we want to stay
You and I, dancing through the moonlight
Underneath the stars, oh what a sight (oh what a sight)
I'm ready, our hearts start to race
In the dance of passion we find our place
Your body to the rhythm, so beautiful, so fine (oh beautiful, so fine)
Our dreams wash up with the incoming tide (with the incoming tide)
Ooh, this one dark place
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Human life
