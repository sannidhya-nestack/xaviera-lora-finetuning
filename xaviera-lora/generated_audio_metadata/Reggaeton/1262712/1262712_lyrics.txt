She walks on the dance floor lighting up the night
Her rhythm it speaks to me, feels so right
In her eyes I see the sun, in her smile the moon
We're lost in the rhythm, hope the morning comes soon
Five beats of silence then the bass drops in
Her body moves lost in the Latin spin
This ain't no ordinary scene it's a paradise found
Her feet don't even seem to touch the ground
Underneath the palm trees our world comes alive
In this rhythm paradise, we jive
In the heartbeat of the night, in the lantern glow
We dance, we live, let the music flow
His whispers in Spanish, they're a sweet refrain
A promise of love in a tropical rain
Their story unfolds in a language they know
An endless song in a soft low glow
The night whispers secrets in the starlit dance
Time may pass but they're locked in a trance
This ain't no scripted scene, it's their paradise found
Their hearts beating to their own sacred ground
Underneath the palm trees their world takes flight
