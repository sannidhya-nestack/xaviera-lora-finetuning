Why are you leaving?
You don't even say bye hey hey hey hey
Wait wait wait wait
I'm just feelin'
Breaking my heart, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Running, running, running to pick up the pieces
Of my heart'cause you were so bad
Oh my God, what you did me dead? Oh my God
Running, running, running to pick up the pieces
Of my heart'cause you were so bad
Oh my God, what you did me dead? Oh my God
Please don't say goodbye, say hello
I'm missing you all night long
Please don't say goodbye, say hello, say hello
Please don't say goodbye, say hello
I'm missing you all night long
Please don't say goodbye, say hello, say hello
