I love the moonlight so bright
There's a rhythm and a soul taking flight
Your eyes are like a potion way deep in light
In this dance of love there's no place like home
First playing and moving with every beat
The rhythm of the night has never felt so sweet
In the warm tropical air with your hand in mine
Tonight we're more than fine
The whispers of the poems, the twinkling stars above
All the way your body moves, this must be love
With the sound of the ocean playing our song
In this moment with you, this is where I belong
We're swayin' and movin' (movin')
Under the Caribbean moon
The reggae rhythm playin', everything's in tune
Feelin' the love as the music flows
Tonight's the night, anything goes
Swayin' and movin' with every beat
The rhythm of the night has never felt so sweet
In the warm tropical air with your hand in mine
Tonight, we're more than fine
We're swaying and moving with every beat
The rhythm of the night has never felt so sweet
In the warm tropical air with your hand in mine
Tonight we're more than fine
The whispers of the palms are trying to break the line
Tonight we're more than fine
The wish you and me in this paradise
Our reggae pop dream it feels so nice
But we're so nice
It feels so nice
We're swaying and moving, move
Under the Caribbean moon
The regular rhythm playing everything's in tune
Feeling the love as the music flows
Tonight's the night anything goes
We're whispers of the palms between green stars above
Oh the way your body moves
This must be love
With the sound of the ocean playing our song
In this moment with you is where I belong
Dancing close to the palms of twin constellations above
Oh the way your body moves there's must be love
With the sound of the ocean playing our song
In this moment with you is where I belong
Oh more than fine
It feels so nice
It feels so nice
I'm better than moonlight, so bright
If you're with a man, so take it light
Your eyes are like the ocean, wave me too high
In this dance of love, there's no place to hide
