Sun, get down now, you'll get a new
Dawn, started getting so late in the hour to go up
Dawn, sweaty bodies moving with the tropical rhythm
Come a little closer, no need for the prism
Feel the waves crashing, the heat is flashing
In your eyes I see the passion
We're on this beach now, under the moonlight
Go, let's feel the rhythm, the night is inside
Go, dance with me darling all through the night
Move on the rhythm feels oh so right
It's our love story in this island paradise
With every beat we roll the dice
Dance with me darling all through the night
Move on the rhythm feels oh so right
It's our love story in this island paradise
With every beat we roll the dice
Fresh salty air is mixing with your perfume
In the sea of bodies you're the one I consume
Feeling your skin hot under my touch
In this game of attraction you're my royal flush
Whisper dreams in the tropical breeze
Your words float around pulling my heart at ease
A night filled with magic under the twinkling starlight
In your arms everything feels so right
Dance with me darling
Under the palm trees in the light of moon
We sway with the keys it's all a love melody
In this tropical paradise
With every strum we pay the price
Dance with me darling all through the night
Move on, the rhythm feels oh so right
It's all our story
In this island paradise
With every beat we roll the dice
As the night fades, we leave the sins
With memories of love in these foreign lands
Till the sun rises and the new days spawn
We'll keep dancing to the break of dawn
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
