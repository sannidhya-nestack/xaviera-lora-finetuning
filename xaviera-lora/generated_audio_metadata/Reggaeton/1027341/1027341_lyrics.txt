It's so easy to et
All the patterns that we share
I want to remember
The team, the team
All the moments were so great
I just couldn't laugh all day
And we drank, we cried away
So real
So real
Todos ya se fueron pero quedo yo
Y me quedé sola, ya me quedé sola
Quiero recordarlos como lo mejor
Mm-hmm, ay-ay
Something inside my body is missing you
Something inside my body is missing you
Oh, something inside my body is missing you
Something inside my body is missing you, oh
Something inside my body is missing you
Something inside my body is missing you, oh
Something inside my body is missing you
Something inside my body is missing you, oh
The moments were so great
I just could not laugh the day
And we dream we cried away
Surreal, surreal
Todos ya se fueron pero quedo yo
I just could not laugh the day
And we dream we cried away
Surreal
So real
Todos ya se fueron pero quedo yo
Y me quedé sola, ya me quedé sola
Quiero recordarlos como lo mejor
Mm-mm, ay-ay
Something inside my body is missing you
Something inside my body is missing you, oh
Something inside my body is missing you
Something inside my body is missing you, oh
Something inside my body is missing you
Something inside my body is missing you, oh
Something inside my body is missing you
Something inside my body is missing you, oh
Something inside my body is missing you
Something inside my body is missing you, oh
Something inside my body is missing you
Something inside my body is missing you, oh
Something inside my body is missing you
Something inside my body is missing you, oh
