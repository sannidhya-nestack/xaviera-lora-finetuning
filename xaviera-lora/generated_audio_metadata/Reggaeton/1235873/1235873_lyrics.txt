Oh na na, oh na na, oh na na
Oh na na na na na na na
I feel you, I see you, I need you
Nobody else knows me this way
I love you, I hate you, it's so true
Fall for every silly word you say
Every twisted secret makes me hotter
Pull away from you, why bother?
Lost in your eyes, I can't escape
Wrapped in your arms, I've sealed my fate
Baby baby baby baby why you gotta lie to me
Baby baby baby baby why you gotta make me cry
Baby baby baby baby this happens every time
Baby baby baby baby gotta say goodbye
Gotta leave you don't want to yeah it's true
Living this way is just no good
Addicted to your lust can't get enough
How can I be so misunderstood
Your kiss is like a drug I can't get over
Every taste of you leaves me wanting more
Leaves me wanting more
I'm sure you've heard this a thousand times
But you truly are the one I adore
The one I adore
Baby baby baby baby why you gotta lie to me
Baby baby baby baby why you gotta make me cry
Baby baby baby baby this happens every time
Baby baby baby baby gotta say goodbye
Baby baby baby baby gotta say goodbye
Oh na na oh na na oh na na
Oh na na na na na na na
Baby baby baby baby why you gotta lie to me
Baby baby baby baby why you gotta make me cry
Baby baby baby baby this happens every time
Baby baby baby baby gotta say goodbye
