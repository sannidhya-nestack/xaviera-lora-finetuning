Come closer diamond, look and feel this tropical heat
Your eyes unite like, oh what a treat
The rhythm captures us in a dance so wild
In your arms, I'm lost just like a child
In the moonlight, under the palm tree sway
Our bodies intertwine as the music starts to play
Your voice is on my rhythm, you lost my serenade
In this dance of passion our memories will never fade
Skin on skin, under the starry dome
In the expanse of the beach, we find our home
Your kisses taste like summer, but sensations are divine
In this rhythm, in this moment, forever you are mine
As the waves hit the shore, we're lost in our dance
In the rhythm of the night, caught in a trance
This melody runs through us some mystical feet
As we dance to the rhythm our hearts simply beat
In the moonlight, the middle of the palm trees sway
Our bodies intertwine as the music starts to play
Your whisper's on my rhythm, you lost my serenade
In this dance of passion our memories will never fade
As the waves hit the shore, we're lost in our dance
In the rhythm of the night, caught in a trance
This melody runs through us, some mystical feat
As we dance to the rhythm, our hearts skip a beat
As night turns to dawn, as stars begin to fade
Your love is my melody, our music has been made
This dance may end, but our melody lingers on
Tonight, in your arms, a new love song is born
