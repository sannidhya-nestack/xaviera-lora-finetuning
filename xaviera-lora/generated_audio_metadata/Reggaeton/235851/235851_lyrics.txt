Candela, the voice of Latin America
A new dance for the whole wide world
Darnatus
Paper Chasers, right
Hula hoop now, hula hoop now, hula hoop now
Everybody dance, hula hoop now, hula hoop now, hula hoop now
A new dancing, out to the left then round and round
Out to the right go round and round
Up down like a merry go round
Now round and round but don't let it fall down
Sadden me can't stop me leg from moving
Me can't stop me body from shaking
Tell me what are you thinking
Come the love, a new dance I bring now
Hula hoop now, hula hoop now
Hula hoop now, everybody dance
Hula hoop now, hula hoop now, hula hoop now
A new dancing
Hula hoop now, hula hoop now, hula hoop now
Everybody dance
Hula hoop now, hula hoop now, Hula hoop now
A new dancing
Round round like a merry go round
Round round like a merry go round
Round round like a merry go round
Say round and round but don't let it fall down
Konbanwa konichiwa
Quien soy yo candela
Un baile nuevo que hula hula
Una vuelta que no se caiga
A la derecha una vuelta
A la izquierda otra vuelta
Vuelta, vuelta que no se caiga
Un baile nuevo caigo candela
Hula hoop now

Round round
Like a merry go round round
Like a baby go round, round, round
Like a baby go round, say round and round
But don't let it fall down
But don't let it fall down
But don't let it fall down
Say it'cause they're loud!
Hula hoop now, hula hoop now, hula hoop now, everybody dance!
Hula hoop now, hula hoop now, hula hoop now, a new dancing!
Hula hoop now, hula hoop now, Hula hoop now, everybody dance!
Hula hoop now, hula hoop now, Hula hoop now, a new dancing!
