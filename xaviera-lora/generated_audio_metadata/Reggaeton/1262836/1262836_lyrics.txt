Come on baby, feel the heat underneath the palm trees
Feel the beat, your lips are sweet
Our bodies meet on this silent street
Can't skip this beat
We're dancing tonight under the neon lights
In the summer air where the moon shines bright
Swing to the melody, join the harmony tonight
Tonight, you're all I see
Your hips sway, takes my breath away
In the golden rays as the music plays
Want you closer, can't get over
This tropical fever, baby pull me closer
We're dancing tonight, lost in paradise
In the rhythm of waves under sparkling skies
Feel the energy, it's our destiny
Tonight, tonight, we're wild and free
Under this tropical moon where stars align
Your hands in mine, we lose track of time
Your laughter is my song, in this dance we belong
In this tropical night nothing can go wrong
Your love remains
We're dancing tonight feeling the vibe
Every beat's a thrill it gives us life this melody
