Boom down the beach as the sun goes down
Under the stars, you wear that crown
Music plays and we start to sway
Lost in the rhythm and the light of the day
Heart to heart, body to body
Moving as one at this beach party
In the moonlight, you and I
Under the summer tropic sky
Feeling the heat as the beat gets faster
et our worries, ignore the disaster
Let the rhythm take control
Feel the music in your soul
Let's groove all night'til the break of dawn
In this dance a new love is born
Heartbeat in sync with the melody
This is our night full of ecstasy
The sky brightens we end this play
A memory made almost perfectly
Dance to the rhythm under the moon
A summer night ended too soon
Heart to heart, body to body
Moving as one at this beach party
In the moonlight, you and I
Under the summer tropics sky
Feeling the heat as the beat gets faster
et our worries, know that it's faster
The rendezvous hit'em dull
Feel the music in your soul
Let's groove all night'til the break of dawn
In this dance a new love is born
Heart beat in sync with the melody
This is a night full of ecstasy
As the sky brightens we end this play
A memory made on this perfect day
Dance to the rhythm under the moon
A summer night ended too soon
