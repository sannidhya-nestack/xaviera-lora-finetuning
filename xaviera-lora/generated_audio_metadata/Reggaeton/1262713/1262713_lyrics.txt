Feet on the sand, we're dancing free
With melody, just you and me
Moon shining bright, a sight to see
This tropical night where we're meant to be
Shimmery stars glittering so high
Playing our song in the soothing sky
Bodies swaying just in time
To the rhythm of the ocean's rhyme
Can you map the old Caribbean heat?
Eyes locked together in every meet
Underneath the palm trees feeling so fine
To the rhythm of love your heart with mine
It's us and the streets'til the break of dawn
Feeling so sweet yet so forlorn
Sipping mojitos lost in your eyes
In the old city streets under colorful skies
The night is young let's dance away
Under the lanterns in the alleyway
To the rhythm of the drums that play so loud
In this city of stars lost in the crowd
Give me that E-O-C-A-R-I-N-D-I-A-N heat
Eyes locked together in every meet
Underneath the palm trees feeling so fine
To the rhythm of the drums that play so loud
