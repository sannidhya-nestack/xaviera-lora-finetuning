Baby another moonlight in this tropical heat
Your silhouette dances and it's moving to the beat
Your hips swing to rhythms that they alone can feel
And I'm lost in the passion that your eyes reveal
Come on now shake it up let's ignite the night
Swing with me under the stars so bright
With every beat you take my breath away
In this rhythm of love, come on let's sway
Feel the music darling, moving through your veins
When you dance like that et about the chains
Skin glowing under the neon lights
Your body's telling stories of those tropical nights
Set it up, heat it up, let's light up the skies
You and I in the rhythm that never lies
Singing love songs with the music we play
In the rhythm of the night, come on sway
Cross any beaches and upon trees
