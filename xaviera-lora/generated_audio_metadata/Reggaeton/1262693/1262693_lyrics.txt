You put a heart in the dish, yeah, but I'll sign you up with your rhythm and I'm looking for fun with the hips swinging like the waves on the sea
I feel the beat with you in this melodic spree
Our hearts are pulsating under the dance when we glide
Cutting the Latin beat with emotions we can't hide
Your silhouette against the moon at sight, I can't deny
In your arms under the stars, let the sky testify
We are dancing, we are swaying under the neon light
In this rhythm of the night, you and I burning bright
Dancing to the rhythm, like a sweet but bleeding fruit
Our bodies are talking, though our lips remain mute
In your eyes, I can see the mountains and the shore
Through dance we explore, it's you who I adore
Your whispers in the wind, promises of the dawn
In this moment, our hearts singing a perfect song
Dance seats swaying under the spotlight's glare
In the rhythm of love, entangled in your stare
Feeling the rhythm, our melody's alright
With you in this dance into the endless night
Under the palm trees as the sun begins to rise
I see the rhythm of love reflected in your eyes
With every beat, every move, every dance, every song
In this rhythm of life it's with you I belong
Underneath the blazing sun we begin to sway
Your rhythm ignites me, keeps my breath away
Your body language speaks loud and clear
This rhythm will ride into music in my ears
Move with me, dance with me under this tropical sky
No need for words, our bodies never lie
To feel the heat, feel the heat
In this tropical night
(Light up the night)
With you, I am the moonlight
Your whispers are triggering
The millions
New whispers I carry with the ocean breeze
We dance to this beat with such an effortless ease
Moonlight shadows cast patterns on the sand
With each sway and swirl I'm closer to wonderland
Dance with me, sway with me all through the night
I'm all by the symphony under the starlight
Feel the rhythm, feel the connection
The hold so divine in the rhythm of this dance
Your heart it just winds in line
As the night's magic envelops the bay
We dance to a rhythm that seems to say
Forever and always in every way
With each beat of the music with you I'll stay
As the sun begins to rise in the morning sky
We linger in this dance as the time goes by
In the rhythm of this love we have found our song
With you in this dance is where I belong
