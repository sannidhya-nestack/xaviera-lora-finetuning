Fill up your heart, it's getting so high
Under the moon, spicy night
I'ma sway you with the rhythm of the night
Hold on to the floor, let's set it right
Chillin' by the beach, the soft sand beneath
Close your eyes, let your worries release
Pour another drink, feelin' the heat
Living for this moment, hearts skipping a beat
Turn the beat up, let it resonate
Let the rhythm flow, no time to hesitate
Dancing through to dawn, there's no room for debate
This is our vibe, our perfect state
Whispering the wind, under the sky so clear
Living loud and free, with you so near
Drop a sweat, whisper in my ear
Taking all the chances, having no fear
Whisper in the wind, under the sky so clear
Living wild and free with you so near
Drop a sweat, whisper in my ear
Taking all the chances, having no fear
Hearing the drum, feeling the bass
Lost in the crowd yet found in the space
This ain't a race, no need to chase
Just close your eyes, get lost in our own place
As the sun sets in the red orange glow
With the beats echoing, feeling the flow
Hands in the sky, heart's beating slow
This is our rhythm, our reggae show
Whisper in the wind, I resonate
Let the rhythm flow, no time to hesitate
Dancing through'til dawn, there's no room for debate
This is our vibe, our perfect state
Whisper in the wind, under the sky so clear
Living wild and free with you, so me
Drop a sweat'til dawn, there's no room for debate
This is our vibe, our perfect state
Whispering the wind under the sky so clear
Living wild and free with you so near
Drop a sweat whisper in my ear
Taking all the chances having no fear
Whispering the wind under the sky so clear
Living wild and free with you so near
Drop a sweat whisper in my ear
Taking all the chances having no fear
