In the heart of the city, under the neon light
Exotic rhythms moving, taking over the night
Palm trees, crystal clear seas, oh it's a lovely sight
Lost in the dance baby, everything feels so right
Shaking hips, pallid lips, driving me insane
Girl you're like a tropical storm running through my veins
In this iridescent night we leave the world behind
Under the soft moonlight we find a world that's kind
Under the soft moonlight we find a world that's kind
Under the soft moonlight we find a world that's
Passing through the rhythm, moving to the beat
Caught in the moment, feeling the heat
Our bodies swaying under the midnight sun
In the silent paradise our love has just begun
City skips fade as we hit the salsa floor
Her eyes are saying baby let's dance some more
Barefoot in the sand under the star flame
Paradise is right here and it's calling our names
Feeling the rhythm pulsing through the night
In the silent fever everything feels right
Our hearts are beat under the moonlit sun
In this reggae love song
Our lives have just begun
