Feel the heat, feel the rhythm right under the sun
Dancing on the beach, the fiesta just begun
Palm trees swaying, as we're moving with the beat
This kind of freedom can't be beat
With the waves we dance, no second chance
In the twilight under the moon's expanse
With the rhythm of love and the stars above
This is our dance, this is our love
Like the breeze, move with ease under the neon lights
In this city of dreams with all these beautiful sights
Savor the night with all its tropical delight
It's our song and it feels so right
With the stars we move, feel the groove
In this island paradise we have nothing to prove
With the rhythm of the night, holding each other tight
This is our song, this is our fight
Feel the rhythm, feel the vibe in this paradise
Underneath the tropical skies where love never dies
Let the rhythm, let the beat guide our dancing feet
