In this intoxicating dance we lose track of time
Body to body moving just like rhyme
Can you feel the rhythm?
Mine in your heart
Swaying under the moonlight it's only the start
In this vibrant city we dance without a care
Let the night become our canvas
Pinging memories in the air, in the air
Your laugh's contagious under the starry sky
Captivating me with every look in your eye
In the rhythm of the night, we're spinning around
Can't help but dance to this infectious sound
Your touch turns me around, oh it's hard to resist
Your sweet whispers in the wind, sealed with a kiss
In this intoxicating dance, we lose track of time
Body to body moving just like rhyme
Can you feel the rhythm, mine in your heart
Spraying under the moonlight, it's only the start
In this vibrant city, we dance without a care
Let the night become our canvas, painting memories in the air
In the air, your laugh's contagious under the starry sky
Captivating me with every look in your eye
In the rhythm of the night, we're spinning around
Can't help but dance to this infectious sound
Can you feel the rhythm?
A mind in your heart
Swaying under the moonlight
It's only the start
In this vibrant city
We dance without a care
Let the night become our canvas
Painting memories in the air
