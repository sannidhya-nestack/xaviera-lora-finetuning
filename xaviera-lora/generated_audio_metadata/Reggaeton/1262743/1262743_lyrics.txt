Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Landed in the city under the summer heat
Moving with the rhythm feeling the upbeat
Neon lights are burning as the day turns to night
Feeling the energy everything feels just right
We move yeah we groove under the city lights
Feeling the rhythm those summer nights
Caught in a dance, lost in the reverie
Caught in these pools, our urban symphony
Walking through the streets with the moon hanging high
Music's getting louder as the stars light the sky
Your hands in the air, my heartbeat elevates
In this urban jungle we dance, let's celebrate
We move, yeah we groove under the city lights
Feeling the rhythm those summer nights
Caught in a dance lost in the reverie
