On the sandy beach under the lights
Your body swings such a sight
With every beat our bodies rhyme
In this tropical paradise we're lost in time
Oh shake it move it in the setting sun's glow
Feel the beat just let go in this rhythm we grow
In this dance love will show
The echo of the sea
Your laughter pure
In your eyes I find cure
Heat of the moment under the moon
To this rhythmic delight our hearts attune
Oh shake it move it under these tropical skies
Dance with the band and look in my eyes
With the rhythm our love multiplies
In this dance our spirits rise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Swaying palms whispering our names
In this dance we play no games
Get lost in the rhythm
Feel the beat in our hearts on the streets
In this island under starlight
We dance, bathing soft moonlight
In this rhythm we're full of life
Under the stars, free from strife
