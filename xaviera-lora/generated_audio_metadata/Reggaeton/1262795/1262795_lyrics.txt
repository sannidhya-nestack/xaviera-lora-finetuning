Yeah, under the moonlight, straight to the beat
You got me hypnotized with your tropical heat
Your eyes they're like the ocean pulling me into the deep
Your kisses are the sweetest thing they make my heart skip a beat
Baby when we dance it feels like we're in a trance
Making it sound inside in some romance
Where the stars align in this paradise
Turn the volume up let's dance through the night
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Country silhouette against the setting sun
So none of darling feels like we've just begun
Your touch like a sea breeze drives me wild and free
Our hearts beat in rhythm in this perfect harmony
Time slows down when you're in my arms
Moonlit night and the rhythm charms
This moment's better than my sweetest dreams
Let's dance to the music, let's chase the breeze
Here in the heat, where the night never ends
We dance, we laugh, the rules we bend
Life's a party, we're feeling so high
Underneath the velvet, starlit sky
You, me and the magic beat
