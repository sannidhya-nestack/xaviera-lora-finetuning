By the pen of misery I'm feeling so right
Your lips whispering my name
Everything else is a game
In this dance
There's no room for shame
Dancing to the beat of the strawberry heat
Underneath the stars where our souls meet
Hold on tight
Don't let go, infinite flow
In the city's heartbeat
Let's lose control
Dancing to the beat
In this choppy heat
Underneath the stars where our souls meet
Hold on tight don't let go
In this rhythmic flow
In the city's heartbeat
Let's lose control
The moon shines illuminating your eyes
This music speaks to us through no lies
With every beat and drum
Onto the midnight strum
In your arms I become undone
Swinging to the rhythm
Losing all the heat
Captured in this moment
Our hearts meet
In this timeless dance that makes the city glow
As the beat goes on our love will grow
The night whispers our stolen story
A dance between two in all its glory
As the sun paints a new day born
Remember this night in the heart of the dawn
I'm dancing to the beat in this tropic heat
Underneath the stars where our souls meet
Hold on tight don't let go in this rhythm that's made slow
In the city's heartbeat let's lose control
The night whispers our stolen story
A dance between two in all its glory
As the sun peaks, a new day born
Remember this night, in the heart of the dawn
