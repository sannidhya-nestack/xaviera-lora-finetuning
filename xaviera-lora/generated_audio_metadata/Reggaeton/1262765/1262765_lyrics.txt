Baby, you got me glowing in your love like a melody
Glowing like an ember in the heart of a cold sea
I feel with the rhythm you rise a mystery
Underneath the moonlight, it's where we gotta be
With the rhythm of the night, we got the vibe so right
You whisper in the breeze, got me weak in the knees
We're dancing to the beat in this tropical heat
Feeling so alive during this summer night
Underneath the palm trees lost in the island breeze
Baby it's just you and me this is awesome for me
And your body's like an ocean flow along the tide
In this element of passion there's no way we can hide
In swimming in your love, drowning in your sight
Our hearts beating together on this sweet summer night
With the rhythm of the night we got the mood so right
Your whisper in the wind, got me waking in the night
We're dancing to the rhythm
Passion's not your victim
Feeling the summer groove
With every move we prove, oh
Under the starry skies
Caught in your loving eyes
Baby, it's just you and me
In the sweet ecstasy
In the rhythm of the night
We got the vibe so right
You're my summer in the breeze
Got me weak in the knees
We're dancing to the beat
In this tropical heat
Feeling so alive during this summer night
During this summer night
Lost in an island breeze
Baby it's just you and me
This is all so brand new
In the heart of the city
Where the lights are so pretty
I found a girl she's spinning my world around
Her laughs like a song makes me feel so strong
With her everything seems so profound
Dance we sway chasing the night away
Lost in the rhythm where we belong
Her eyes my sight under the neon light
Feels like a melody of a love song
She moves like a flame whispering my name
In the rhythm she's glowing so bright
Her touch my skin it's more than a fling
This feeling just feels so right
We're caught in the groove with every rhythm
We move like a wave with her I collide
This dance, our song, with her I belong
In this rhythm we confide
We dance, we strike
Chasing the night away
Lost in the rhythm where we belong
Her eyes, my sight
Under the neon light
Feels like the melody of a love song
She moves like a flame
Whispering my name
And the rhythm she's growing so bright
Her touch, my skin
Is more than a flame
This feeling just feels so right
We're caught in the groove with every rhythm we move
Like a wave with her I collide
This dance our song with her I belong
In this rhythm we confide
The dance we sway chasing the night away
Lost in the rhythm where we belong
Her eyes my sight under the neon lights
