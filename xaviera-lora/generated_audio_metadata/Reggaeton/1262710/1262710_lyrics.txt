Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Thought of sunbeach, music turned up loud
Cocktails at dusk, melts in the crowd
Just wait'til the music is hypnotized in sight
East sun just flows and then I fade in light
So let the rhythm take control
Shake your body, lose your soul
Beneath the shimmering stars until the moon will glow
Just let the night unfold
Dance floor, under open skies
Heat of the moment, mirror in your eyes
Passion, the rhythm mixed in sweat
A dance tonight, we'll never et
So let the rhythm take control
Let the beat, let the rock, let it roll
Underneath these neon lights and tropical flow
Just let the night unfold
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
A symphony of summer under a silver moon
Got that feeling in our hearts the beat pairs with the tune
Just let the rhythm take control
We feel the beat, let it rock, let it roll
You know right where we go, the music in our soul
We'll always let the night unfold
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
What the oceans whisper and the rhythms tie
Promise to dance when we side by side
As the night reveals its tropical glow
Together we just let the night unfold
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
But this is plus for matter where no oceans whisper and the rhythms tied
Promise to dance with me side by side as the night reveals its tropical glow
Together we just let the night flow
