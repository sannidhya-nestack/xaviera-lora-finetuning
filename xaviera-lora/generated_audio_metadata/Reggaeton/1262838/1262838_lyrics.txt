Found the rhythm so sweet it took my heartbeat slow
Down the narrow alleys where secrets came to play
Fell in love with the night and the reggaeton way
Our bodies intertwined yeah we're dancing so close
To the rhythm of the nights that we're moving in slow-mo
Gimme that rhythm, gimme that beat
Let's turn this city into our dancing street
With every strum, every note in tune
We are alive under the Caribbean moon
From old San Juan to the coast of Miami
The speed is catching fire like a fevered symphony
Through whispered poems and the crashing of the waves
Our heartbeats, our heartbeats blending in
Got us feeling so big
As the night falls onto the coast of Miami
The speed is catching fire like a fevered symphony
Blue whispering palms and the crashing of the waves
The heartbeats blending in, got us feeling so amazed
As the night falls down and the stars shine brighter
The rhythm gets louder, it's a party igniter
Give me that rhythm, give me that beat
Let's set the world, dance into our street
With every clock, every tuner we croon
We are alive under the Caribbean moon
From Old San Juan to the coast of Miami
The speed is catching fire like a fevered symphony
Rules burn palms and they're crashing other waves
Our heartbeats, our heartbeats blending in
From where we move
We dance with a nice old drum in the rhythm of passion
Our song be a song beneath the stars under the royal blue night
Lost in the rhythm feeling so right
