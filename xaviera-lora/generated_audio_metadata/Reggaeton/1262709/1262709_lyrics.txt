Hear you, stepping in the room
Got the heat turning up, no need for the moon
You sway, like the rhythm of a tide
Caught in your current, there's nowhere to hide
Feeling the rhythm beneath the hot sun
You move, you groove, you're the only one
Bodies collide on the beat we trust
In this dance of love, it's just us
Use me fills my ears like a sweet song in your arms is where I belong
A story written in the sand with the rhythm of the waves hand in hand
Under the stars we find our tune in the dance of love beneath the moon
You touch your kiss lights the night in the symphony everything feels right
As the sun comes up, we'll keep it beating this dance of love
Feel the heat, our story painted in the sunrise hue
This is our song, just me and you
