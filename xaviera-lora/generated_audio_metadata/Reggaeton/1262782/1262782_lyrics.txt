Caught in the rhythm, lost in the beat
Under this tropical night where the stars meet
Eyes like fire, burning so bright
Drawn to the music and the hazy moonlight
Move your body, feel the heat
Dancing together where the waves meet
Under the palm trees beneath the stars
Heartbeats sink into the sound of guitars
Silver moon high, sand beneath our feet
Lost in a melody our souls meet
Island whispers entice in allure
Into the rhythm we surrender pure
Swing with me under the starlit sky
Caught in the music as time slips by
Island whispers enticing a roar
Into the rhythm of surrender pure
Swing with me under the starlit sky
Caught in the music as time slips by
Sway to the rhythm ride the tide
In this moment let our hearts collide
The music spoken, the love untold
In the rhythm, let our story unfold
Turn it up, let the music play
In the silence, let our bodies sway
Underneath the stars, let the rhythm roam
In the music, we found a home
As dawn breaks on a distant horizon
In the rhythm, a new day's rising
Silver moon high, sand beneath our feet
Lost in a melody, our souls meet
Silver moon high, sand beneath our feet
Lost in a melody, our souls meet
I'll slip by
Soar in the rhythm
Part of the rhythm
Part of the rhythm
Part of the rhythm
Soar in the rhythm
Part of the rhythm
Part of the rhythm
Part of the rhythm
Soar moon high
Set beneath our feet
Lost in the melody
Our souls meet
Island whispers entice and allure
Into the rhythm we'll surrender pure
Swing with me
Under the starlit sky
Couldn't use me as time slips by
I hear the whispers enticing me more
Into the rhythm it's a random lure
New music spoken, a love untold
In the rhythm, let our story unfold
