We're moving'neath the neon lights
Feel the rhythm baby hold me tight
Tropical heat in the heart of the city
Our love story bright and gritty
Come and dance with me in the moonlight
Hot summer nights feeling so right
Underneath the stars lost in paradise
Riding on the beat of love's our only vice
Taste the sea salt on your lips
Moving closer with your swaying hips
Waves crashing in as the music plays
In this rhythm love always stays
Come and dance with me in the moonlight
Hot summer nights feeling so right
Underneath the stars lost in paradise
Riding on the beat of love's our only vice
Grab my hand and let's take flight
Through the rhythm of the moonlit night
In this island city, it's a lover's spree
In this dance, love's the only decree
Come and dance with me in the moonlight
Hot summer nights, feeling so right
Underneath the stars, lost in paradise
Riding on the beat, love's our only fight
