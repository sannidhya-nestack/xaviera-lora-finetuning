The air is getting a little colder now
I still drive by your house sometimes
Time is gone but my mind's still there somehow
Lost thinking'bout all the days of you and I
Every night we stay up late
Talking'bout our past mistakes
Every night I hear you say
The things that made me follow you
Every night we stay up late
Making all the same mistakes
And before long I had to run away
You taught me some things never change
Some things never change
You told me some things never change
Some things never change
You told me some things never change
Days are short but they feel longer now
The man I used to love doesn't feel like mine
There's nothing left for me in this little town
Lost thinking'bout all the days of you and I
Every night we stay up late
Talking'bout our past mistakes
Every night I'd hear you say
The things that made me fall again
Every night we stay up late
Making all the same mistakes
And before long I had to run away
You told me some things never change
Some things never change
You told me some things never change
Some things never change
You told me some things never change
Every night we stay up late
Talking'bout our past mistakes
Every night I hear you say the things that make me fall again
Every night we stay up late making all the same mistakes
And before long I had to run away
You taught me some things never change
Some things never change
You taught me some things never change (some things never change)
Some things never change (you taught me some things never change)
