Underneath the turpentine sky
Dancing on the sands of time
Your heartbeat syncs with mine
Rhythm and rhyme we intertwine
I'm falling under your tropical spell
Those emerald eyes, oh they tell
The story of us, we're love and lust
In the silent breeze, unite and trust
Move with me in this wild, wild night
Feel the rhythm, oh baby hold me tight
In every whisper of the sea
There's a song of you and me
Feel the music in the air
As the sun sets love in flare
With the beat of the drums
To the rhythm of our hearts love comes
Painted with shades of a golden hue
In this paradise I found you
The ocean mirrors our serenade
In this rhythm our love portrays
Swim with me in this moonlit sight
Dance to the rhythm under the starlight
Every rustle of the palm tree
There's a melody of you and me
As the moon takes the throne
In this rhythm love is home
Dance with me in a love-esque tree
In the rhythm of love two hearts meet
With every beat and every tone
In this rhythm our love has grown
Underneath the Caribbean sky we found love
In rhythm we lie
Move with me in this wild, wild night
Feel the rhythm, oh baby, hold me tight
In every whisper of the sea
There's a song of you and me
Feel the music in me every air
As the sun sets, love and flare
With the beat of the drum
The air as the sun sets
Love and flare with me
Through the mutes it's thrown in this sight
Lead us to the rhythm fair
Weep the beat of the drums
To the rhythm of our hearts of crumbs
Painted with shades of a golden hue
In this paradise I found you
The ocean mirrors our serenade
