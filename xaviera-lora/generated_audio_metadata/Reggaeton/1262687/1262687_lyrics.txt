The girl I had a better time with
Ponies in the breeze we play
Bright lights up at night we embrace
Dance with me in this tropical space
Tonight you and me under the stars so bright
In the moonlight feeling just right, right
Oh it's the rhythm, the heat, the passion
In our city of dreams we're the main attraction
This melody, intoxicating and wild
In your gaze, reflected, I'm beguiled
The music and laughter, the echoing delight
Dance with me, love it throughout the night
Together you and me, under the velvet skies
In the moonlight, losing each other's eyes
It's the rhythm, the beat, correlation
In our city of dreams, we'll remain attraction
Together you and me, under the velvet skies
In the moonlight, lost in each other's eyes
It's the rhythm, the beat, correlation
In our city of dreams, we're the main attraction
It's the whispers of the warm sea breeze
The rhythm of our hearts' sanity
Just us two, the night is young
With every beat, our song is sung
Tonight, you and me, under the glowing moon
In moonlight, we'll be sweeping off our feet soon
It's the rhythm, the passion and the action
And I see your dreams, you're the main attraction
Slow through the night, we continue to sway
Until the first light of the day
And I see your dreams, let the music play
Dance with me, my love, let's stay
In my bed all night
Orange juice in my free-on-the-fly
Late nights with an alien grace
Dance with me in the tropical space
In my bed all night
Orange juice in my free-on-the-fly
Late nights with an alien grace
Dance with me in the tropical space
