In the heart of the city, under the moonlight, dancing to the beat
Holding you tight through the rhythm of the night
We take flight, chasing the melody feels just right
Persuading, we're moving, in sync with the vibe that's grooving
Lost in the music, bodies are tuning
Under the stars and the hearts that we're losing
Your laughter is my favorite sound
In this rhythm our hearts are bound
Under the same sky on the same ground
With you my love I've truly found
Swaying we're moving
In sync with the vibe that's grooving
Lost in the music bodies are tuning
Under the stars as our hearts say we're losing
