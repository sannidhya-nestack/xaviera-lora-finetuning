Lost in the city, look at the neon sky
Focus rhythm in our hearts, and a glimmer in our eyes
Dancing in the moonlight, can you feel the beat?
Eyes locked, hearts drop, swept off your feet
Tonight we dance, let the rhythm free
In this moment it's just you and me
Close to the rhythm, under the city lights
Let the music play, till we hit the heights
Hop rhythm in the strumming bass
Your body moves with such a grace
Silhouettes swaying in the city's glow
Two hearts beating in tempo slow
Tonight we dance till we touch the stars
Caught in the rhythm etting our scars
Feeling the beat as our bodies sway
In unison we move as the music plays
Tonight we dance
Tonight we dance, we dance, we dance all night
On this rhythm, we hit your heart
Move into the music, nothing else matters
As the night grows deep and the chatter scatters
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight we dance, let the cities thrive
In this rhythm we feel alive
This is our moment under the city's glow
Two hearts united in the dance floor's flow
Tonight we dance, we dance, we dance all night
On this rhythm, etting our school how
Pop rhythm and a strong and bass
Your body moves with such a grace
Ooh, I can still feel the lights swaying
In the city's glow
Two hearts beating, it's a music play
night we dance,'til we touch the stars
Caught in the rhythm, etting our scars
Feeling the beat as our bodies sway
In unison we move as the music plays
Dance for the street
Tonight we dance (tonight we dance) in the dance floor of ice
Just you and me in the dance floor of ice
On this rhythm we hit your rhythm
On this rhythm we hit your eye
Tonight we dance in the dance floor of ice
On this rhythm we hit your eye
In the dance floor of ice
