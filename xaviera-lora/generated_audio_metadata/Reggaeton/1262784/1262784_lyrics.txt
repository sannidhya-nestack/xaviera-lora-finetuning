When the intersetter blow out the water home
Oh no, whispers of the night coming soon
In the rhythm, lost we continue to move
Oh, the city sleeps but we're in the groove
This intoxicating rhythm, this infectious beat
Under the stars where our hearts meet in trumpet breeze
Mixed with neon lights, feels just right in these endless nights
Streets turn into a secret dance floor
Music laughter and so much more
Caught in the rhythm, lost in the sound
In a private paradise we finally found
Electric lights sparkling in your eyes
To the rhythm our bodies synchronize
In the tropical heat, wrapped up in daylight
Love comes alive in the soft moonlight
Hand in hand as the beat slows down
Two silhouettes against a sleeping town
Bathing under the stars in a dream and move profound
In the rhythm of the night to each other we're bound
As the night turns to dawn, music ends
In the silence, the memory of tonight extends
And as the first rays of sun begin to ascend
It's our farewell, it's just until we dance again
Electric lights sparkling in your eyes
To the rhythm our bodies synchronize
In a tropical heat wrapped up in daylight
Love comes alive in the soft moonlight
Heat the silver glow of the moon
Udo, whispers of the night coming soon
In the rhythm, lost we continue to move
Oh, the city sleeps but we're in the groove
