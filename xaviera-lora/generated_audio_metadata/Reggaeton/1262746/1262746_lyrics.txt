Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby you got me flying
Your love's like a melody
Blowing like an ember
In the heart of a cold sea
Your hips move with the rhythm
Your eyes are mystery
Underneath the moonlight
It's where we gotta be
With the rhythm of the night
We got the vibe so right
Your whisper in the breeze
Got me weak in the knees
We're dancing to the beat
In this tropical heat
Feeling so alive
During this summer night
Underneath the palm trees
Lost in the island breeze
Baby it's just you and me
This is our symphony
Your body's like an ocean
Flowing along the tide
In this element of passion
There's no way we can hide
Swimming in your love
Drowning in your sigh
Our hearts beat together
On this sweet summer night
With the rhythm of the night
We got the mood so right
Your laughter in the wind
The story without an end
We're dancing to the rhythm
Passion's not a victim
Feeling the summer groove
With every move we prove
Under the starry skies
Caught in your loving eyes
Baby it's just you and me
In this sweet ecstasy
In this rhythm of desire
We're setting the night on fire
Under the veil of night
Baby we're burning bright
This is more than a song
It's where we truly belong
Tonight it's you and me
