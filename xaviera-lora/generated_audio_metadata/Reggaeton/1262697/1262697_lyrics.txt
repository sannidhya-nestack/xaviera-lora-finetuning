Slipping up in the search of night
Caught up in the pale moonlight
Tropical waves crash and sink
With this vibe we don't need to think
Got me spinning, spinning around
Lost in the rhythm, in the sound
Through the bleak you hold me near
Under the stars you pull me clear
He wrapped around us a fiery glow
Whispers of love, soft and low, yellow
Your eyes are like the deepest sea
Reflections of mystery, standing free
Lift me up, let's touch the sky
In this rhythm, we live and die
In the sound, in the beat
The rhythm of our hearts meet
In this moment, breaking dawn
To the rhythm of our song
All our secrets laid bare
Lost in the rhythm without a care
As the night fades gives way to the sun
To the rhythm, wave of anyone
In this dance under the trumpet band
Silver rhythm, heart in hand
