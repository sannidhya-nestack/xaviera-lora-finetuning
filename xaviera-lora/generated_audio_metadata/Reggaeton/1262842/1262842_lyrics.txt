Move into the city night
Under the neon lights
No room for worries
Just feeling alright
Heartbeat acting like a drum
Till the rhythm wants to come
Feeling the music
It makes us become
One with the rhythm in the midnight glow
Footsteps whispering secrets only we know
In the traffic breeze where worries can't hold
We'll dance'til dawn feeling brave and bold
Beat of the city plays our song
In this moment nothing can go wrong
Fire in our eyes, passion untamed
In the rhythm of the night
We're captivated and claimed
Word of the city plays our song
In this moment nothing can go wrong
In our eyes, passion untamed
In the rhythm of the night
We're captivated and claimed
One with the rhythm in the midnight sea
Where the moonlight kisses secrets set free
In the dance of shadows in the soft moonlight
We'll surrender to the rhythm into the night
One with the rhythm in the midnight sea
Where the moonlight kisses secrets set free
In the dance of shadows in the soft moonlight
We'll surrender to the rhythm into the night
As the sun slowly rises, we're feeling the heat
This night will be a memory, bittersweet
In the rhythm of the night, under the starlight
Remember this moment, this perfect delight
