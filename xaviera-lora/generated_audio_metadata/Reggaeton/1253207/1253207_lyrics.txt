Promise baby I will never get tired, oh get tired
I'm always thinking'bout you, my line, oh my line
In the morning rain with you I saw all the strange
So cool baby, finally, finally straight to your lips
If you don't really want this, baby, take it
You don't need to sit and wait
If you don't really want this, baby, take it
You don't need to sit and wait
I don't wanna break hearts for you if I break it again
If you don't really want this, baby, take it
You don't need to sit and wait
Tell me, baby, I won't even get tired
I won't get tired
I'm always thinking that I'm alive
Thought it might be a one-night-only time
I won't get tired
I'm always thinking'bout you no matter what
Hold on tight
And I'll pull in
From the waist up to your eyes
If you're all I want is to be the ticket to the middle seat
For those of you who need any type of guitar
That's all I'm asking for your no lie, oh no lie
In the pouring rain we feel our souls dry
So call back that family
From yesterday to now
If you want this, baby, take it
You don't need to say no way
If you want this, baby, take it
You don't need to say no way
I'm on my way
After you leave, I'll be okay
If you want this, baby, take it
You don't need to say no way
'Cause baby I'm gonna get tired, oh get tired
But it's always looking better when I'm high
