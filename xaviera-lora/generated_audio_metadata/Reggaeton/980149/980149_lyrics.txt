Smile for a while
Never wear no frown
Keep on smiling
Keep on smiling
I woke up a winner this morning
Don't you know that you a winner
You're one in a million a winner
A brand new day I'm still breathing
Everyday you're breathing
That's another reason to be believing
Push up your hand if you're winning
Push up your hand if you a winner yo
Act like you a winner yo
You're loving the life that you're living
Life is for the living
Get to loving and living come on
I ain't worry bout nothing
Got my game face on
Call me spice I got the sauce
Flavor like Saison

Take away
You're breathing, that's the reason that people leave in the weave in the living gotta live, get to living, get your soul out of prison, there's a whole lot for giving, still left in you, use it while you still got some breath in you, the best in you is worth more than any man revenue, I woke up a winner this morning

I don't wallow in pity, I pause, stop and pray up
To the God Elijah, Hora however you say it
Bring it, you a winner, my brother natural vibes
