Turn up the volume, let the speakers relax
I wanna feel the reverb, let the movement last
Feeling the vibe under the neon lights
This pulsing beat has got me up all night
Oh when the bass drops and the rhythm is hot
We're dancing in the night giving all we got
Don't need no resting or slowing down
This rhythm of the tropics has us spinning'round
The music's sweet as the summer air
We're swaying to the groove without a care
Move your body, don't you be shy
this beat will lift us up to the sky
When the night falls, and the rhythm calls
We're dancing barefoot on the once and for all
The stars above us, the ocean around
Lost in the melodies, the sweetest sound
Under the moonlight, we meet the palms
This rhythm takes over like a soothing balm
Coaster, we dance, whispers in the breeze
Magic in the night, we're floating with ease
As the sun rises and the party slows
We're left with the memories of the cool wind blows
Caught in the rhythm, lost in the groove
This moment's perfect, we got nothing to prove
So let the music play, let this night stay
In the rhythm of this play, we'll dance the night away
The music's sweet as the summer air
We're swaying to the groove without a care
Move your body, don't you be shy
this beat will lift us up to the sky
When the night falls and the rhythm calls
We're dancing barefoot on the warm stands
For all the stars above us, the ocean around
Lost in the melodies, the sweetest sound
Under the moonlight beneath the palms
This rhythm takes over like a soothing balm
Closer we dance, whispers in the breeze
Magic in the night, we're floating with ease
As the sun rises and the party slows
We're left with the memories of the cool wind
We're all caught in the rhythm, lost in the groove
This moment's perfect, we got nothing to prove
So let the music play, let this night stay
In the rhythm of this play, we'll dance the night away
