I'm reminded of the summer when I dated Sarah Plummer
In that Indiana town where we both lived
She was a tenth and down from heaven
On a good day I was a seventh
But that didn't seem to bother her a bit
When she took me by the hand
It made me feel like a grown man
I deserve for a high seat such as me
I guess she taught me how to love
And when push comes down to shove
Ain't that how it's all supposed to be
I guess most of us will have a Sarah Plummer
Who comes along and helps us to discover
All the things that people write about in songs
The kind of things that we knew all along
I ran into her today
And felt the air just melt away
Time hasn't done a thing to dull her shine
I felt the passion start to rise
When I looked into her eyes
But I knew it was too late to make her mine
I guess most of us will have a sorrow plumber
Who comes along and helps us to discover
All the things that people write about in songs
The kinds of things that we knew all along
Our paths diverged so long ago
And we went down our separate roads
But we kept little memories for the trip
She preferred the family life, I took a different script
With her two precious little kids
And her hand now holding his
It did me good just to see her smile
We talked a while and shared some laughs
I reminisced about the past
Now I'll hold on to this memory for a while
I guess most of us will have a sorrowful mind
Who comes along and helps us to discover
All the things that people write about in songs
The kinds of things that we knew all along
The kinds of things that we knew all along
The kinds of things that we knew all along
