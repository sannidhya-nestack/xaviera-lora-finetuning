Well we're dancing under the city lights, body moving
The rhythm's right, she's looking at me
No more disguise, love in the air and it's no surprise
The speed of love can't hold it in
Feel the rush as our world starts to spin
It's you, it's me, we're breaking free
Just like the waves of the deep blue sea
Look at her, her eyes a dream
Her smile the sweetest I've ever seen
Moving close, her hips don't lie
In this moment feels like we could fly
This beat of love is profound and deep
Here tonight there's no more sweet
It's you, it's me on this dance free
Caught in the vibes of the rhythm and beat
No distance, no divide
Caught up in this beautiful ride
This love, our soundtrack
Like a fever, it's a fact
This beat of love got me on my feet
Feeling alive, ain't no defeat
It's you, it's me in this melody
Dancing through the night, setting us free
And as the sun starts to rise
Still dancing under the blue skies
Lost in the rhythm in this beat
It's you, it's me, this love's so sweet
In the heart of the night under neon lights
Got a rhythm in our feet feeling so right
She's a dazzling sight, oh what a delight
Into the rhythm we dive, lost in the vibe
Tropical beat, under the heat
Dancing so close can feel her heartbeat
Living this moment, letting go
In the rhythm, we lose control
Her eyes like stars, shining so bright
