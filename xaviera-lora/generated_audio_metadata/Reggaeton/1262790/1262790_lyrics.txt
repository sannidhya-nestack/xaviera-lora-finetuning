Oh, oh, oh, the two dinosaurs, oh, oh, oh
I'll be at the North Star
I'm so far away'cause my homegirl is a star
Late at night, under the city lights
Feeling the rhythm, starting to ignite
Your eyes, they pull me like a tide
Immersed in the vibe, no place to hide
Electric clutch, sizzling like the sun
Rig it don't beat, makes everyone run
Hot like salsa, cool as the sea
Come a little closer, dance along with me
Over your body, baby don't stop
Feeling so right like a theist and non-stop
Under the moonlight let's sway and twirl
In this groovy night, you're my reggaeton girl
Shadows dancing on the walls
Echoes of laughter fill the halls
From soul kisses under the stars
Close ourselves to the rhythm of your tongue girl
Oh girl, oh
A cold night of sorrow
Appeared and non-stop
Under moonlight let's sway and non-stop
Lookin' down, girl
Sweet whispers, ricochet the air
Tangle together in the music glare
Swept away in a tropical breeze
You and me, an exotic tease
Oh sway with me, oh reggaeton night
Caught in the rhythm, lost in the moonlight
Shake and shimmy, groove and spin
This reggaeton love, it's a sweet sweet sin
In the syntactic, caving rhythm we are free
Our hearts in sync with the reggaeton spree
In a sensual dance there's no room for pretend
Embrace the moment, let it transcend
Oh girl, oh, the moonlight is on bro, oh
Papi and the non-sha, the normal life, let's ride on home girl
Love in your home girl
Oh girl, oh, the moonlight is on bro oh
Papi and the non-sha, the normal life, let's ride on home girl
Love in your home girl
As the night fades into the bright new dawn
The echoes of our laughter still linger on
One dance, one night under the stars green
This reggaeton love, a beautiful dream
