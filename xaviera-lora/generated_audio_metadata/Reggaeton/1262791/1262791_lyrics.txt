Tonight's the night we've been waiting for
Underneath the stars on the dance floor
Heart in sync with the Latino beat
Keeps rising as our eyes meet
Swaying left, swaying right
Moving closer, holding tight
Round and round, we twirl with delight
Lost in this tropical magical night
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
We dance, we sing, we feel alive in this vibrant town
We thrive, embracing moments that arrive in the rhythm of life
We dive, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Silhouetted by the fiery sun
When the music plays and hearts are one
With each beat of the drum we unite
In the charm of the neon light
Side to side in the moonlit night
With the rhythm keeping us upright
Living our dream in black and white
In this old dream, balmy night
We're on cloud nine, underneath the palm tree line to the rhythm of the night, we align in this musical harmony
