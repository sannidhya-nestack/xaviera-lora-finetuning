Dancing on the sands by the sea
You and me, as free as can be
Swinging hips, a tropical breeze
Night's alive, we move with beat
Hear the rhythm catch the dive
Under the moon our hearts collide
In this dance we lose the time
Caught in the rhythm feeling so fine
Your smile sparkles in the night
In your eyes I see the delight
Move so smooth so out of sight
With this rhythm you feel so right
Feel the rhythm catch the vibe
Under the moon our hearts collide
In this dance we lose the time
Caught in your rhythm feeling so fine
Your small sparkles in the night
In your eyes I see the delight
Move so smooth so out of sight
With this rhythm you feel so right
Feet are strong and feet are tapping
In this rhythm nothing's lacking
Whisper words hearts impacting
With this dance there's no retracting
Feel the rhythm catch the vibe
Under the moon our hearts collide
In this dance we lose the time
Caught in the rhythm feeling so fine
Feel the rhythm catch the vibe
Under the moon our hearts collide
In this dance we lose the time
Caught in the rhythm feeling so fine
Feeling so fine
As the stars fade with the day
With you I wish to sway
In this rhythm we find a way
In this dance forever we'll stay
All I ever want
