The beats are languished before our room (our room, our room, our room, our room)
In harmony to the reggae's tune (reggae's tune, reggae's tune)
Turn up the music, let's ignite (let's ignite, let's ignite, let's ignite)
Dancing together through the night (through the night)
Lost in the rhythm, feels so right
In this world of ours, no need for light
Your eyes, the sparkle reflecting mine
In a moment, realities intertwine
Can't hold back, crossing that line
In a dance of love, oh so divine
Turn up the music, let's ignite
Dancing together through the night
Lost in the rhythm, feels so right
In this world of ours, no need for light
Your eyes are stark, reflecting mine
In a moment reality's intertwined
Can't hold back, crossing that line
In a dance of love, oh so divine
Turn up the music, let's create
A melody love, we're not a bait
With this beat, we elevate
In this dance, we celebrate
Under starlit skies
Wishes take flight
In the language of tunes we write
A melody of us beneath the night
In the rhythm of love's sweet delight
Turn up the music, let's ignite
Dancing together through the night
Lost in the rhythm, feel so right (feel so right)
In this world of ours, no need for light (no need for light)
The music, let's create (let's create)
Oh, not alone, we're not afraid (we're not afraid)
With each beat, we elevate (we elevate)
In this dance, we celebrate
