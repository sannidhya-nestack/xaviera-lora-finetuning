Elated, captivate me with that smile so sweet
Underneath the rhythm feel the Latin beat
Your eyes they sparkle just like the Caribbean sea
Together in this dance floor just be here with me
Dance let's dance just move your body on
In this rhythm babe from dusk till dawn
Groove, we groove, in this melody we align
In this tale of love, will you be mine?
Waves are crashing just like my heart beat for you
Your moves enchant me and the night feels so new
Shining under starlight our shadows intertwine
Vibes are ripe feeling the warmth of your sunshine
Dance let's dance caught in this sweet song
To the rhythm babe where we belong
Groove, we groove, under the moon's design
In this tale of love, will you be mine?
Oh, our bodies sway in a rhythm so divine
Whisper sweet melodies in this dance of love I find
Passion pulsating, beats sinking in rhyme
Tonight is the night, let's et the time
Dance, just dance under the night so fine
In your arms, babe, can I call you mine?
This tale of love under the stars alone
With each beat, with each rhythm, your love is mine
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
All by this way in the rhythm so divine
To the rhythm babe where we belong
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Under the stars alight
Each beat with each rhythm love is mine
Until the stars align
