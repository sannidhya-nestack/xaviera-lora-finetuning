The night on blood, the setting of lights
Caught up in it with the members in the night
Our hearts beating on the same vibe
Can't escape your magnetic vibe
You and me, lost in time
Dancing through the night, feeling so alive
In the midst of the crowd we found our song
Swaying together to the soldiery tone
Passion in your eyes, glowing so bright
Setting my world on fire, spreading the light
Your touch takes along my heart, no eraser
Every beat I close your name, you're my chaser
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh
Glossin' in your eyes, glowin' so bright
Settin' my world on fire, spreadin' the light
You're attached to a tune on my heart, no eraser
Every beat echoes your name, you're my chaser, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Hope I beat every rhythm, takes us to cloud nine
In the realm of music, our souls intertwine
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
As the sun replaces the moon
Can't help but pray for this tune
This pop reggaeton rhythm that defines
The un ettable dance under the city signs
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Yeah
we beat it feeling them sisters to cloud nine
You know Velma when they take our souls and it's fine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
