Turn off all your heart and let's ignite the night
Go into the rhythm on the city lights
Tropical beats thumping making us sway
Are you ready to party let the music play
We're dancing with the stars in a rhythm divine
Feeling this rush losing all sense of time
Caught up in the magic of this tropical rhyme
Let's light up the night with love that intertwines
I can do it twice
The warmth of the sand'neath our bare feet
Waves crashing along to our heartbeat
Breathing in the night we feel alive
With a pulse and beats let our spirits dive
Exotic nights fill the fiery lights
Spin it around soaring to new heights
Echoes of laughter, whispers of fun
Chasing paradise'til the break of the sun
Break of sun
In this balmy air we're feeling free
Dancing in sync with this wild spree
Lost in each other's spellbound in delight
This is our story painted in the moonlight
