She's blue on the day, blue on the day, there's no light
Love in the rhythm, she's dancing through the night
Got his arm that's as bright as the morning sun
Captivating all, she doesn't have to run
She was first to look at her body, feeling right
Got me wrapped around her finger under the moonlight
Can't resist her charm, she's a magnetic delight
This girl a mystery under the starlight
She dances to the rhythm, moves to the beat
Turns a simple moan into a tropical heat
With her mesmerizing movement, I'm complete
A fusion of passion where two worlds meet
Her hips don't lie as she sways with grace
Got that fiery spirit, no one can replace
Surrender to the music, let everything loose
This reggaeton-flavored love is what I choose
With every beat of the drum, feel the bass ignite
Hustle away and view a captivating sight
We'll dance away the night'til the dawn's first light
In this world of ours, everything feels right
She dances to the rhythm, moves to the beat
Turns a simple moment into a tropical heat
With her resonating movement, I'm complete
A fusion of passion with two worlds, me
A two world city
Her hips don't lie
As she sways with grace
Got that fiery spirit
No one can replace
Surrender to the music
Let everything loose
This reggaeton bit of love
Is what I choose
With every beat of the drum
Feel the bass ignite
Her silhouette and view
A captivating sight
We dance away the night
the dawn's first light
In this world of ours
Everything feels right
She gets to the rhythm
Moves to the beat
Turns a simple moon
Into a tropical heat
With her intoxicating love
I'm on repeat
This is a song with two rhythms, me
As the night's winding down, still lost in dance
A reggaeton fairy tale and a moolah romance
Her laughter in the air got me in a trance
This is a story about love events
About love events
Two rhythms, two rhythms, me
