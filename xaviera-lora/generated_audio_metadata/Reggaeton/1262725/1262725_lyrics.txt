Beneath the moonlight, our shadows intertwine
Heat of the night makes the stars align
Of every beat your heart is speaking for mine
Dancing on the rhythm just like a fine wine
On the beat feel the heat our souls taking flight
In the haze of passion we're lost in starry night
Music flows love glows in the tropical twilight
Underneath the heavens everything feels just right
In your arms I find my home amidst the ocean spray
With each rhythm and ecstasy our bodies sway
You touch and my spark's taking our breath away
Until the dawn in this dance of love we stay
Feel the rhythm let it move you in the moon soft light
With a blend of sultry sounds dancing through the night
Hearts and heartbeats apart under the stars so bright
Together we make music in this sweet twilight
I see sunbeams from the horizon, promising a new day
Drenched in the melody of love, in this dance we sway
Feel the rhythm, feel the love, let it take you away
Dance with me darling,'til the break of day
