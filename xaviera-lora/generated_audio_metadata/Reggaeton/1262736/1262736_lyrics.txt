Underneath the flashing lights, lost in your hazel eyes
Caught in this heat, oh baby, it's no surprise
Your touch is like a melody, setting my soul on fire
In this dance of passion, there's no room for time
On this crowded floor, all I see is you
Feeling the rhythm, it's a rendezvous
In the neon lights with your hand in mine
With every step, love's more than divine
The bass is bouncing, your hips are swaying
Each move we make leaves the whole world praying
Caught in this rhythm beneath the twilight sky
In this tropical paradise, sun seems to fly
We dance to the beat, lost in the groove
In the warmth of the night, it's our love we prove
Just you and I amidst the tropical bliss
Sealed with the rhythm, sealed with a kiss
On this crowded floor all I see is you feeling rhythm
It's a rendezvous just you and I amidst the tropical bliss
So here we are under the sun
