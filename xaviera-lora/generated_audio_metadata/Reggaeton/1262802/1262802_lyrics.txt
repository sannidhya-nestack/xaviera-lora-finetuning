Midnight city lights, it's tropical vibes
Moving to the beat, feeling so alive
Caught in your eyes, under the moon's light
Living this night, like it's the last night
Feel the rhythm, let it flow
Moving through the body slow
Underneath the salty sky
With a groove that never lies
Whispering words in a language of love
Sailing with the stars in the skies above
Beats down echoes with the chorus of the night
Caught in Ella's dance till we see the daylight
Feel the rhythm let it flow
Moving closer, body slow
Underneath the salty sky
With a groove that never lies
Two hearts beating in the golden glow
Falling like the rain, moving like the flow
To a song that plays deep within the soul
This moment's ours in the night so whole
Feel the rhythm let it flow
Move your grooves so body slow
Underneath the salty sky
With a groove that never lies
Dancing universe beneath our feet
Ending too soon, this rhythm so sweet
With every heartbeat echoing this song
In this life we dance to a love so strong
