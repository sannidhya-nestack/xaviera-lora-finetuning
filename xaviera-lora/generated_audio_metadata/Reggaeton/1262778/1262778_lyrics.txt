Waking up with a heart so light
Catch the rhythm of the morning light
Feel the heat, smell the ocean breeze
In this paradise just you and me
But we dance under the pale moonlight
To the rhythm of our hearts so right
This is our song, our song of delight
In this realm of records all night
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Your touch sets my world ablaze
Your gaze puts me in a haze
Lost to you, found in the rhythm
We become the melody in this writing anthem
We sway with the tropical vibe
Engulfed by the waves and high tide
With your hand in mine and a soulful rhyme
Beneath the stars there's a track of time
Feel the rhythm, feel the heat
Two hearts dancing to the same beat
Close your eyes, let it sweep you off your feet
In the symphony our souls meet
Oh we're alive in the rhythm divine
Of the moon where the constellations align
It's a symphony of love assigned
In the night where we're in a tossed wine
As the dawn breaks and the stars fade inside the rhythm of our memories are laid
An echo of the reggaeton serenade in our hearts the melody will never fade
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
