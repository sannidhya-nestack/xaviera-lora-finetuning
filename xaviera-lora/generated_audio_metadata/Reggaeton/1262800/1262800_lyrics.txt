Hoy tal vez ya es pasado
Me suena de a porcina
Imagina que animento onda so' abusiandos
Bouncin' on the rhythm, yeah, we keep it real hot
Fire in our hearts, yeah, we give it all we got
Touchdown in the city where the sun never stops
Shinin' bright like a diamond, now we're on the clock
We move with the beat, no time for sleep
Dance under the stars where the sea is deep
Turn the music up, let the speakers pop
Livin' the dream and we'll never stop
Mystic nights, tropical vibes just right
Every beat of the drum sparks the light
Eyes on the horizon, colors so bright
Synced with the melody into the night
Raise your hands, feel the heat
Caught in this moment, let it repeat
Rhythm of the night, making hearts leap
In this world of ours, promises will keep
Through every echo, through every sound
With every twirl and every round
In the sea of people we have found
Music that binds us, love that's profound
Move with the beat, no time for sleep
The silent life, secrets we'll keep
Turn the speakers up, let the music peak
Live in the wildlife while the world still sleeps
As the sun sets, as day ends
With music our hearts, time bends
Let the rhythm take us, to where it intends
This is our story, where the reggae blends
Move with the beat, no time for sleep
The silent life, secrets we'll keep
Turn the speakers up, let the music peak
Live in the wildlife while the world still sleeps
As the sun sets, as day ends
With music our hearts time
