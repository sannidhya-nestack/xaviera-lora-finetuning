In the islands full of doom, lit by the silver moon
Dancing shadows start to croon, whispering a tropical tune
Your touch like a summer breeze, sets my heart at ease
Surrounded by the glistening seas
Let's get lost in this teaser
We sway under the stars
Caught in the rhythm, no memoir
Surrendering to the sound of guitars
The painted on our avatars
Moving closer heartbeat to heartbeat
We're rhythm and passion-y
Lost in the rhythm, not discreet
Dancing on this fiery street
Bathing in the morning glow, as the soft winds start to blow
Your eyes with that enchanting glow, matching the sun's golden show
Caught in the rhythm time ceases, not playing it's mischievous pieces
Just stay in this moment's leases, as the rhythm increases
So let's dance under the stars, making melodies on our own spar
In this rhythm, no scars, just love filling our reservoirs
Getting lost in the sultry beat where rhythm and love meet
Caught in this musical retreat, life never seemed this sweet
As the night fades away
Greeting the break of day
This rhythm will always stay
Like an endless love ballet
Danced under the starlight
Moved by the rhythm so right
In this island of endless delight
Music was our one true night
