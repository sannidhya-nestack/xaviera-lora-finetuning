Yeah, she's dancing in moonlight, under the stars glow
Moving her body to the rhythm, she's a sight to behold
Golden skin eyes that sparkle, stealing the show
She's a mystery, my heart's history, stirring up my soul
We're caught in this rhythm, lost in the beat
In this tropical paradise, feeling the heat
With every glance she gives, every twirl and sway
The music takes over and it starts to play
Feel the heavy rhythm
Surrender to the night
In this melting pot of passion
Set your spirit alight
Move your body freely
Loose like the ocean wave
Dance with the music
It's a feeling you crave
That's the feeling you crave
As the palm trees sway and the night becomes the day
Her laughter's the melody that sets my heart aflame
Every beat of the drum, every strum of the guitar
Brings us closer under the sky
Full of stars at the rhythm control
Let the music take over in this wild fiesta
Become high roller from the dusk till the dawn
Let's dance away our fear
To the vibrant melodies only our hearts can hear
As the music fades and the dawn breaks through
The dance floor's empty but my heart's full of you
The night was ours as we swayed to the beat
