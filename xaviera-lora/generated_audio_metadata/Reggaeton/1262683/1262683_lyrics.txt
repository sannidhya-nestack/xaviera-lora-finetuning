Shining under the tropic sun
Babe, you're the only one
Your eyes, they twinkle just like the sea
You and me, it's destiny
Dance with me in this rhythm, sweet
Feel the sand beneath your feet
The ocean waves, they love our tune
Under the sizzling afternoon
Move with me in this island glow
With the rhythm fast and slow
We're dancing in the tropical heat
Feel that magical heartbeat
Oh baby, you're my fantasy
In this wild rhythmic sea
Our bodies sway, they twist and twirl
In this enchanting tropical world
Her palm trees whisper secret sweet
To the rhythm of our beat
Your laughter, pure, rings so true
It's the sweetest melody I knew
Moonlight strikes our sun-kissed skin
A love story, let's begin
Your touch, it lingers soft and light
In the silence of the tropical night
Move with me in this island glow
With a rhythm fast and slow
We're dancing in the tropical heat
Feel that magical heartbeat
Oh baby, you're my fantasy
In this wild, weird-lit sea
Our bodies sway, they twist and twirl
In this enchanting tropical world
The palm trees whisper secret sweet
To the rhythm of our beat
Your laughter cure it rings so true
It's the sweetest melody I knew
Moonlight strikes our sunken skin
A love story let's begin
Your touch, it lingers soft and light
In the silence of the tropical night
Sway with me'til the break of dawn
To the rhythm, we're drawn in this paradise
You and me, lost in our rhythmic spree
We dance, we love
Under the stars above
This is our record love
Sway with me'til the break of dawn
To the rhythm we're drawn
In this paradise you and me
Lost in our rhythmic stream
Dance we love under the stars above
Baby this is our reggae love
