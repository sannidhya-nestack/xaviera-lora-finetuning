Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come with the stories of the city lights
Under the starry summer nights
Baby you and me setting the world on fire
Heart beating to the rhythm of our own choir
Turn up the music let the bass ring
Lost in the crowd and the love we bring
Slow and soft it's just the beginning
With every beat feels like we're winning
Oh we're dancing in the rhythm of the night
Underneath the glow of the moonlight
In this magic moment you and I
Believe in love no need to ask why
Fly with me let's take it slow
Through the waves of the rhythm we follow
Whisper to me those sweet words
The most beautiful melody I ever heard
Feel the heat feel the passion
Our hearts set in a rhythmic fashion
City of dreams city of desire
Your arms warmth of your fire
Dancing in the rhythm of the night
Underneath the glow of the moonlight in this magic moment you and I
Believe in love no need to ask why
Turn up the music let the bass ring
Lost in the crowd and the love we bring
Slow and soft it's just the beginning with every beat feels like a win
Oh we're dancing in the rhythm of the night
Underneath the glow of the moonlight
In this magic moment you and I
Believe in love no need to ask why
Climb with me let's take it slow
Through the waves of the rhythm follow
Let us meet the glow of the moonlight
In this magic moment you and I
Believe in love no meaning
Me and I believe in love no meaning
Oh we're dancing in the rhythm of the night
Underneath the glow of the moonlight
In this magic moment you and I
Believe in love, no need to ask why
Believe in love, no need to ask why
