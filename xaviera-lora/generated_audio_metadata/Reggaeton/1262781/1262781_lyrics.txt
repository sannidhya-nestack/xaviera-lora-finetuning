Blended on the other end of a present sky we move, we sway
Feel the rhythm inside me on the streets, though it'll soon be a day
Hypnotic dance, making all our hearts skip a beat
Take my hand, let's escape through the blaze
Lost in the beauty of the moonlight gaze
We're the rhythm of the night and loving all the ins and outs
Dance'til our sun rises, et all the pains
Twinkling stars, let's look back, drop
Each beat, each move, make the time stop
Bare feet on the sand, echo our song
In these moments nothing could go wrong
Take my hand, let's escape through the blaze
Lost in the beauty of the moonlight gaze
With the rhythm of the night and love in our veins
We'll dance'til sunrise, et all the pains
Take my hand, let's escape to the blaze
Lost in the beauty of the moonlight gaze
With the rhythm of the night and love in our veins
We'll dance'til sunrise, et all the pains
Take my hand, let's escape to the blaze
Lost in the beauty of the moonlight gaze
With the rhythm of the night and love in our veins
We'll dance'til sunrise, et all the pains
Pleasing stars as the backdrop
Each beat, each move, make the time stop
Bare feet on the sand, echo our song
In these moments nothing could go wrong
Twinkling stars as the backdrop
Each beat, each move make the time stop
Bare feet on the sand, echo our song
In these moments nothing could go wrong
Take my hand, lost to paradise
Hazed, drove caught on the charm of the twilight maze
With the rhythm of the night guiding our dance
Caught in the echo of this sultry romance
Oh
Faulty romance
Oh
As the night was the secrets I told
Our bodies sway, bold and bullet blazed
Wither the sky, clothed in gold
Magic in the air, love stories unfold
Take my hand as we dance in this daze
Through passion, through rhythm, through the moonlit blaze
Our dance tells a story, love that amazes
Caught up in the music, in the reggae craze
As dawn breaks, we're still caught in the dance
Lost in the rhythm
Caught in the trance
Whispers of love
Under the morning expanse
This is our story
Our pop reggaeton romance
Woah-oh-oh
Holdin' the echo of a soul tree romance
Woah-oh-oh
Holdin' the echo of a soul tree romance
Woah-oh-oh
Holdin' the echo of a soul tree romance
Woah-oh-oh
Holdin' the echo of a soul tree romance
