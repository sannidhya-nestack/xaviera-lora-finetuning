Underneath this ultra sky
Catching the rhythm's vibe
Body moving left to right
Neon lights are in our sight
Can't resist your mesmerizing eyes
Refueled by the city's life
In the rhythm there's no disguise
From sunset to sunrise, oh
We're dancing through the night
Under the moon's sub light
Can't resist the intoxicating delight
This beat just feels so right
Like magic in the air
Throwing caution to the fair
We're lost in this night
Where love feels so light
Ah ah ah
Ooh ooh
Ah ah ah
In the street as drums beat low
Beneath the incandescent glow
You're laughing like a melodic flow
Enchanting as our shadows fall
Let's surrender to this groove
In each other's arms we move
In this moment we don't need proof
Just let the rhythm soothe
So let's keep dancing through the night
Where the stars make everything bright
Caught up in the intoxicating flight
Where everything feels so right
Feel the magic in the air
We got no time for this stare
In this rhythm we're caught unaware
In this love so rare
Ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah
As the night whispers goodbye
Underneath the morning sky
Our hearts beat in a rhythmic tie
A memory we can't deny
Oh, we dance through the night
Under the moon's soft light
With rhythm in our soul and love in our sight
Music remains our eternal delight
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
Ooh, ooh
La, la, la, la
