On me these days and tropics
Your gaze sets my soul on fire
With the rhythm in our hearts we're hypnotic
Caught in this whirlwind of desire
Lost in the rhythm under the city lights
Just you and me and it feels so right
Every memory's strong in this tropical night
Dance with me in this captivating sight
A dash of tequila, some midnight blue
The secrets we share on the palm trees brew
In your arms the music rings true
It's the rhythm of paradise, it's you
Under the city lights playing our song
The rhythm of heat where we truly belong
Tangling rhythm
Where we dance along
In this vibrant night
Nothing can go wrong
