Don't know if you're aware, what I feel for you
Analyzed, you sympathized, I'm crazy about you
It seems our paths have crossed, it's been damned all the way
I did my best to entertain and please you every day
I'm delicious and delicious
I'm a sinner and a saint, I could be vicious
Do you really really wanna know me?
Miss D4Diva they call me
I'm delicious and delicious
I'm a sinner and a saint, I could be vicious
Do you really really wanna know me?
Miss D4Diva they call me
Been there many times
Begging over you
I followed, chased you, called you, paged you
Trying to get to you
It's been a restless night
Dreaming about you
Caressed, embraced you
Kissed and dazed you and dined you all the time
And now you tell me that you never, never, never, never knew it (never, never, never, never knew it)
You don't deserve a thing that I could've, should've, would've done for you (should've, would've, would've done for you)
I'm malicious and delicious
I'm a sinner and a saint, I could be vicious
Do you really, really wanna know me?
Miss D4D4 they call me
I'm malicious and delicious
I'm a sinner and a saint, I could be vicious
Do you really, really wanna know me?
Miss D4D4 they call me
El ayer se ha acabado, hoy
Las esperanzas ya no existen
La llave yo he tirado, mi puerta se ha cerrado
Y todo me ha sedado, voy
I'm delicious and delicious
I'm a sinner and a saint, I could be vicious
Do you really really wanna know me?
Miss D for diva they call me
I'm delicious and delicious
I'm a sinner and a saint, I could be vicious
Do you really really wanna know me?
Miss D for diva they call me
I'm delicious and delicious
I'm a sinner and a saint, I could be vicious
Do you really really wanna know me?
Miss D4D5 they call me
But you never never never never knew it
