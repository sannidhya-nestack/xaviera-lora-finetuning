Sipping on the moonlight under the tropical night
Skin enchanting vibe that's oh so right
Waving magic in the rhythm lost in each other's sight
In the city where the stars shine bright
The beat drops and so do our inhibitions
Surrender into the night, no conditions
Your hands on my waist, a subtle proposition
As we dance like fire to the rhythm's ignition
Tonight we dance, no words are spoken
Under the neon lights, softly broken
For every beat of the drum is a promise woken
In the pulse of the city, love's token
Closer we sway in the sea breeze
Caught in the rhythm set at ease
With every strum every tease
We're dancing our stories just as we please
Barefoot on the sand feeling the fusion
Caught in the music sweet illusion
Beneath the silver moon's intrusion
In the rhythm of love is our conclusion
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Bet it drops and so do our inhibitions
Surrendering to the night, no conditions
Your hands on my waist, a subtle proposition
As we dance like fire to the rhythm's ignition
So now we dance to words unspoken
Under the neon lights, awfully broken
For every beat of the drum is a promise woken
In the pulse of the city lost token
Close to the city and the feeling, secrets caught in a rhythm set at ease
With every beat of the drum there's a promise spoken
The pulse of the city lost token, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Lost token, lost token, lost token
Closer we sway in the sea breeze
Caught in the rhythm set at ease
With every strum every tease
We're dancing our stories just as we please
