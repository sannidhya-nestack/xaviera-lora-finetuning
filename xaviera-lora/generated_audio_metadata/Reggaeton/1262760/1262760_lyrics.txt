Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, I see you moving
Across the dance floor grooving
Underneath the neon lights
You're a sight that's so appealing
Your energy it gets me feeling
I just can't deny
My body starts to sway
Under the rhythm lost in the play
Feels like the rhythm is here to stay
Are you a dream? Don't fade away
When the beat drops low we gonna dance high
In the fall sing lies under the starry night
With the rhythm we collide like the ocean tide
With our bodies intertwined
Feels so right, so right
Oh yeah
Baby your aura is gleaming
Got my heart wildly beating
A rhythm like no other is sweeping me off my feet
Feels like we're in a tropical heat
Body against body under the moon's glow
In the magic of the night we let our colors show
Skin to skin we're in a rhythm unknown
Tasting paradise like a sweet mojito
When the beat drops low we gonna dance high
In the pulsing lights under the starry night
With the rhythm we collide like the ocean tide
With our bodies in a twine
Feels so right, so right
Between the dance and the rhythm
We found our freedom
In this tropical night, we're pulsing with a colorful light
This moment we're sharing, there's nothing comparing
Drawn by the rhythm, you and I in this endless night
