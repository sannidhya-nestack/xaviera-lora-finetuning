Semiramis
They thought I'd be out
Under the moon's glow in a star filled night
Your hips moving slow, oh girl you're a sight
Caught in the rhythm, lost in the beat
This tropical vibe, it feels so sweet
Let's dance, let's sway, under the stars so bright
Feel the rhythm, the beats, embracing the night
With you by my side, under this moonlit sky
Everything feels just right, oh my, oh my
Yeah
God, it can't be this tight
Your eyes sparkle more under the disco lights
The rhythm takes us over as we soar to new heights
The music pulls us closer and you're holding tight
In this rhythmical paradise it's our endless night
In the heat of the night we're chasing the tide
In our hearts the rhythm of the music resides
Together we sway lost in the dance
In this tropical rhythm we're in a trance
In this tropical rhythm we're in a trance
Oh
In this tropical rhythm
As the night turns old and the music slow
Your body close to mine, don't ever let go
Your touch, your breath, feels just right
On this rhythm filled beach under the moonlight
Feels like a dream with the stars in sight
With you dancing next to me under the soft moonlight
The rhythm takes us, the music is our guide
In this tropical escapade let the rhythm coincide
Under the star-studded canvas we dance the night away
In this melody's journey where the palm trees sway
This is our song on this island paradise
Till the sun comes up in each other's eyes
That stills like a dream
