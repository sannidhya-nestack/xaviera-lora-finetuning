Oh, oh, oh
Under a tropical sunset
Feeling the rhythm in our souls
Our bodies swaying together
To the beat we lose control
Barefoot on the white sand
Under a moon so bright
Lost in the paradise
Dancing through the night
Underneath the stars
Feeling the vibrancy
Swaying with the music
Feeling the tropical heat
In the moonlit night
Specks of love in our eyes
In this rhythm of paradise
Where the ocean meets the skies
Piltas drum and drums keep the steady pace
Fires are burning reflecting on your face
Caught in a rhythm under the indigo sky
With the whisper of the ocean under the ponzi light
Caught in the rhythm, feeling the island vibe
In the moonlight, feeling the love tribe
Under the starry skies where dreams come alive
In this tropical paradise
We take the deep dive
Underneath the stars
Feeling the vibrancy
Swaying with the music
Feeling the tropical heat
In the moonlight
Specks of love in our eyes
In this rhythm of paradise
Where the ocean meets the skies
We'll take the deep dive
I won't take the deep dive, yeah
As the night fades with the first ray of the sun
Our bodies still swaying from a night filled with fun
In the tropical rhythm where love seems to thrive
In the dance of life where music makes us feel alive
Underneath the stars feeling the vibrant beat
Playing with the music feeling the tropical heat
In the moonlit night
Specks of love in our eyes (in our eyes)
Spread them of paradise (in the spread of my paradise)
When it all lights up (when it all lights up)
We're able to reach the skies (we're able to reach the skies)
Deep dive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Will it take the deep dive?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Will it take the deep dive?
Mm
Will it take the deep dive?
Mm
