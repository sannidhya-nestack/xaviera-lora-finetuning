Baby we're dancing in the moonlight
Feeling the rhythm feeling so right
Just you and me lost in the sea
We own this night set free
Under the neon skies palms sway
Our bodies move to the music in this open air ballet
In your eyes I'm lost no cost
Something tells me we just can't be tossed
Tequila sides and love silhouette
Which way we move caught up in this dance yet
Heart beats sounding like a castanet
In this rhythm in this groove our love we met
Moon's reflection on your skin
I'm feeling high caught up in this spin
Taste the salt from your kiss
In this moment nothing amiss
White sand under our feet bare
This is our rhythm nothing can compare
Your touch sends me into overdrive
In this dance of love we thrive
Tequila sunset our paths intersect
Sparks fly into the stars we connect
Living in the rhythm our hearts recollect
Star crossed lovers in retrospect
And as the night concedes to the day
Our music fades but our hearts stay
In the dance of love we sway
Unto the rhythm come what may
Remember under that tequila sunset we lay
Bound by the rhythm in a beautiful ballet
Where love resides it's where we'll stay
Till our last dance till our last day
