Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh
We'll dance under the city lights (the city lights)
Body moving, the rhythm's right (right, right, right, right, right, right)
She's looking at me, no more disguise
Love in the air and it's no surprise (no surprise)
Love in the air and it's no surprise
This beat of love, can't hold it in
Feel the rush as our world starts to spin
It's you and me, we're breaking free
Just like the waves of a deep blue sea
Look at her, her eyes are dream
Her smile, the sweetest I've ever seen
Moving closer, hips don't lie
In this moment, feels like we could fly
Look at her, her eyes are dream
Her smile the sweetest I've ever seen
Moving closer, hips so high
In this moment feels like we could fly
This beat of love, snow found in deep
Here tonight, there's no more sleep
It's you, it's me, I'm rich this week
Caught in the vibes and the rhythm and beat
This beat of love, can't hold it in
Feel the rush as our world starts to spin
It's you, it's me, we're breaking free
Just like the waves of the deep blue sea
Look at her, her eyes a dream
Her smile the sweetest I've ever seen
Moving closer, hips don't lie
In this moment feels like we could float, see
Look at her, her eyes a dream
Her smile the sweetest I've ever seen
Moving closer, hips don't lie
In this moment feels beat and love can't hold it in
Feel the rush as the world stops to spin
It's you and me, we're breaking free
Just like the waves of the deep blue sea
Look at her, her eyes are dream
Her smile the sweetest I've ever seen
Moving close, time is don't lie
In this moment feels like we could fly
No distance, no divide
Caught up in this beautiful ride
This love, our soundtrack
Like a fever, it's a fact
This beat of love
Dropping out in deep
Here tonight, there's no more sleep
It's you, it's me, on this dance break
Caught in the vibes of the rhythm and beat
This beat of love
Got me on my feet
Feeling alive, ain't no defeat
It's you, it's me and this melody
Dancing through the night setting us free
And as the sun starts to rise
Still dancing under the blue skies
Lost in the rhythm in this beat
It's you, it's me, this love so sweet
