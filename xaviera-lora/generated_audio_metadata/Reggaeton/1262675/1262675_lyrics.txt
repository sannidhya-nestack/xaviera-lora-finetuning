I'm always fine with you, it's always fun
Dance into the rhythm, hearts ablaze, lost in a tropical daze
Your touch, your smile, they set the tone, in this paradise, we are alone
Lose yourself to the rhythm, feel the island vibe
Under the palm trees, let our worlds collide
Sweet whispers as we sway
Drawing close in the heat of the day
Dance with me, let the moment fly
In this rhythmic seaside ride
Every sunset in your eyes
Under the sky, cream and rose skies
Moonlight pours over the shore
With you who could ask for more
The night whispers a home sweet song
In this rhythm we are strong
Lose yourself to the rhythm
Feel the island vibe
Under the palm trees
Let our worlds collide
Sweet whispers as we sway
Drawing close in the heat of the day
Dance with me, let the moment slide
In this rhythmic seaside ride
Tonight, let's dance through the night
Under one sacred light
In the rhythm we unite
In this dance it feels so right
Let's dance, let's twirl, let's bend
To the rhythm, let's descend
This is us, the melody pen
Till the very end
In the rhythm of the night
Under the stars bright light
With you everything feels right
Let's dance till the morning light
This is our song let it be heard
A love story unspoken word by word
