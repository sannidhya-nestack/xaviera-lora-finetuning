Hey, break it down, let me see you turning around
Hey, push that sound, let me see you turning up loud
Hey, break it down, let me see you shake that crowd
Hey, push that sound, let me see you turning around
My love, go on say what you don't really mean and
Oh, my love, go on say you'll let me intervene and
Oh, my love, you're crying out onto your knees and
Oh, my love, how does it feel, how does it feel
Hey, break it down, let me see you turning around
Hey, push that sound, let me see you turning up loud
Hey, break it down, let me see you shake that crowd
Hey, push that sound, let me see you turning around
Hey, break it down, let me see you turning around
Hey, push that sound, let me see you turning up loud
Hey, break it down, let me see you shake that crowd
Hey, push that sound, let me see you turning around
My love, go on say what you don't really mean and
Oh, my love, go on say you'll let me intervene and
Oh, my love, you're crying out onto your knees and
Oh, my love, how does it feel, how does it feel
Hey, break it down, let me see you turning around
Hey, push that sound, let me see you turning up loud
Hey, break it down, let me see you shake that crown
Hey, push that sound, let me see you turning around
Hey, break it down, let me see you turning around
Hey, push that sound, let me see you turning up loud
Hey, break it down, let me see you shake that crowd
Hey, push that sound, let me see you turning around
