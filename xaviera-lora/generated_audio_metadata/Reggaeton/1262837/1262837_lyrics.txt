I'm feeling the rhythm, it's in the air tonight
Underneath the moonlight, everything's just right
Your eyes, they shimmer, reflect in the night sky
Come a little closer, let's dance, you and I
Let the beat control as we lose ourselves tonight
In a world of sounds and colors, oh what a sight
Turn the music up, let's feel the vibe
Underneath the starlit night, love is a tribe
The waves, they're crashing, we are caught in the tide
Every move I'm making, it's a lover's ride
Your smile is infectious, it's a rhythmic delight
Let the music serenade us, let's dance through the night
Let the beat control as we steal the spotlight
No words needed just your hand holding mine tight
Turn the music up
Let our hearts collide
Immersed in the euphoria in love we confide
So here's to a night we won't ever et
A dance on the beach where love and music met
As day turns into night let's set our spirits free
Just you and me in our rhythmic ecstasy
