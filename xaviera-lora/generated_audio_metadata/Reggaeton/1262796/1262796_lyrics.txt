Dancing through the rhythm under the neon light
Your eyes drawing me in it's tropical delight
Whispered words in the breeze as we sway in the night
Baby you have set my heart on flight
Together we move to shadows in the night
With the island rhythm everything feels so right
Beneath the moon, under the stars so bright
In this melody we found our endless flight
Your laughter like summer warm and pure
The taste of our dreams can't find a cure
With every beat love's allure
In this dance of life we endure
Together we move to shadows in the night
With the island rhythm everything feels so right
Beneath the moon, under the stars so bright
In this melody we found our endless flight
