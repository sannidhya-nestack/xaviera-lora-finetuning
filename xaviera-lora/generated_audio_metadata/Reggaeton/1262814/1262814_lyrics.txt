Yeah, feelin' the rhythm under the sun
Get your body moving, we're having fun
Shakin' to the rhythm, no place to go
Underneath the palm trees, dancin' slow
Dance, dance, let the rhythm take control
In this island of dreams, let the music roll
Move your body closer to me
Under this Caribbean glow
In the heat of the night, oh let's take it slow
Your eyes are sparkling, reflectin' the sea
The way you're moving sets my soul free
So I trickle down but we don't mind
Lost in the rhythm the world behind
Dance, dance to this tropical beat
Our hearts entwine and feel the heat
The night's alive with your laughter's echo
In this paradise just you and I dancing
So, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
As the sun goes down our bodies sway
To this tropical rhythm
We dance the night away
With your touch so sweet
Under this indigo
Holding you close
And we're dancing slow
Your eyes are sparkling
Perfect in the sea
The way you're moving
Sets my soul free
Sweat tricklin' down but we don't mind
Lost in the rhythm the world behind
Dance, dance to this tropical beat
Our hearts entwine and feel the heat
The night's alive with your laughter's echo
In this paradise just you and I dancing so
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Your eyes are sparkling reflecting the sea
The way you're moving sets my soul free
Sweat trickling down but we don't mind
Lost in the rhythm the world behind
Your eyes are sparkling, reflecting the sea
The way you're moving sets my soul free (sets my soul free)
Sweat trickling down but we don't mind
Lost in the rhythm, the world behind
Dance, dance to this tropical beat
Our hearts intertwine and feel the heat
