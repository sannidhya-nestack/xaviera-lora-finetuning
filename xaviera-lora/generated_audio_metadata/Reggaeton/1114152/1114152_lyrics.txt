It's Millie the magical boy
Oh gee, yeah come on, come on
It's a new year I know that I'm stepping on my shelf
No more fears my palm is cheese
Another can of money air the abuse
No more fake friends no more dollar
So many dreams every night in my sleep
When I wake up in the morning say most of
I need to chase the money don't be no pooper
My generation needs me for life
Also for the money now the number one thing
We chasing the money until the money for gone
Money for gone
I say fuck the money, I need only one thing
Any idea on my God, I want my pogo for sure (for sure, for sure)
Money, pogo (pogo, pogo) yeah, yeah, yeah
Out here in my Jordan, stepping on the road
Baroque key and dusty, eyes on the money
So many stains on the way to success
But I gotta keep my head up
No pain, no gain, no glory, no enemies, no shorty, no money
Pop that colour, a positive iron
Just a short paid day for every hustler
We live in the cold war, just make the money clean
I want to be known, to reach and famous
Help the needy, help the poor
Take care of the widows, then do the right thing
I be want give up, give up but I keep my faith
I'm on all be power, I'm on all be grace
Now I'm running make no man run my race
If you check your TV now embrace and my face
Also for the money, nah di no man wantin'
We chasin' the money until the money poggo (poggo, poggo)
Money poggo (poggo, poggo)
Also for the money, nah di no man wantinn'
Any idea wuh ma gah da wuh ma poggo for sure (for sure, for sure)
Money poggo (poggo, poggo), yeah yeah yeah
Every time I wake I say my prayers
Inna de hustle a de jamman
I wanna live like a king go be a hero wanna be a legend
Outside the house and for the door
Take me the cave me shout it loud
Most responsibility in my soul
I'm more more than the law to kill the show
I didn't want give up before but I took my faith
I'm on all the power I'm on all by grace
Now I'm running make no man run my race
If you check your TV now embrace and my faith
I say fuck the money now the number one thing
We chasing the money until the money o ( o o)
Money o ( o o)
I say fuck the money now the number one thing
Any how it be a woman got a woman o for sure (for sure for sure)
Until the money o ( o o)
It's a boring result yeah yeah yeah yeah
I say fuck the money now the number one thing
Also put the money on the number one thing
Until the money go go go go go go go
Also put the money on the number one thing
