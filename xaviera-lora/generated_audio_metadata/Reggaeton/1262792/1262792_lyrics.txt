I see you moving on a dance floor of soil
Underneath the clear and night sky
Your eyes on me my heart takes flight
In the rhythm of the night we ignite
We sway, we glide, we lose disguise
On the tropical rhythm, our love abides, abides
Let the melody tell this tale unspoken
Our hearts beating in rhythm
Promises awoken
Body rolls in the pulsing bar light
Palm trees silhouetted in the human eye
Just me and you in this beach front scene
Ocean respects joining our love unseen
With every beat our souls collide
In this wild rhythm we confide
Look, the pulse that jumps near our emotion
In this sweet dance we found our devotion
We sway, we glide, we lose the fight
To the tropical rhythm of lullabies, lullabies
But if the melody tell this tale unspoken
Our hearts beating in rhythm, promises awoken
We glide
We will recreate our souls collide, souls collide
In this wild rhythm we confide, confide
Live our pulse and drones hear our emotion
In this deep dance we found our devotion
Three foot on the warm sandy floor
Underneath the stars we explore
In your arms amidst the tropical bloom
I found my love in this rhythm we consume
We move, we ignite
Under the soft moonlight
Captured in this enchanting tropical night
With the rhythm soft as the ocean's devotion
In this dance we found our heart's potion
Awoken into the night
The rhythm fades away but in our hearts the melody will always stay
In the dance of love under the palm tree's silhouette
This tropical rhythm
A moment we'll never et
