Underneath the happy past those days
I got in the floor, I filled up some skies
There would be a rhythm in the soul treated in your eyes
Nothing could compare
Feel the sand beneath our feet
Move to the beat, I feel so speed
In the glow of the setting sun, baby
Our story has just begun
Oh, dancing through the night
Your touch feels so right
In a rhythm of still found
Our hearts beat to the same sound
Treasures of the salt and sea
Whispers of love set me free
Beneath the stars we're intertwined
In the folds of time you'll love sign
Stained all fear in the neon light
Our silhouettes against the night
In the rhythm we move as one
Underneath the silver moon all have begun
Oh, lost in the summer heat
Your love always so bittersweet
Under the constellations above
We dance in the rhythm of love
Uh oh
Feel the sand underneath our feet
Move to the beat I feel so sweet
In the glow of the setting sun
Okay, our story has just begun
Oh, dancing through the night
Your touch feels so right
In the rhythm we'll step right on
Our hearts beat to the same sound
Oh, dancing through the night
Your touch feels so right
In the rhythm we'll step right on
Our hearts beat to the same sound
Traces of the salt in the sea
Your whispers of love set me free
Beneath the stars we're intertwined
In the folds of time your love sign
Traces of the salt in the sea
Your whispers of love set me free
Beneath the stars we're intertwined
In the folds of time your love sign
Traces of the salt in the sea
Your whispers of love set me free
Beneath the stars we're intertwined
In the folds of time your love sign
Oh, oh, oh, lost in the summer heat
Oh, oh, oh, it's so bittersweet
Under the constellations above
We dance in the rhythm of love
Oh, oh, oh, as the night gives way to the day
In your arms I wish to stay
In the rhythm of our heart's song
With you is where I belong
