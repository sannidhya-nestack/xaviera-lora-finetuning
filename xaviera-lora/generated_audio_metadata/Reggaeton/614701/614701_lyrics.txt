One of the few words to describe me
It just pumps through my veins, no IV
How I woke up in the spot, no ID
Bottles wet and at tables and can't afford to
Steve
It just pumps through my veins, no one's no one
Woke up in the spot, no one's no one
One of the few words to describe me
It just pumps through my veins, no IV
How I woke up in the spot, no IV
Bottles wet and at tables and can't afford
Steez, one of the few words to describe me
It just pumps through my veins, no IV
How I woke up in the spot, no IV
I was waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Party people, part'em all
Take it down and turn it up
Party people, part'em all
Take it down and turn it up
Party people, part'em all
Take it down and turn it up
Party people, part'em all
Take it down and turn it up
I bet you never ever heard it, heard it, heard it
Pretty hard to find like I'm like I'm a Jesco
Keep on digging homes cause two each is own
See I'm in a different, different zone
I bet you never ever heard it like this flows
Pretty hard to find like it's go, Jesco
Keep on digging homes cause two each is own
See I'm in a different zone
One last rule that you need to know
Party hard like it's the last party that you'll ever know
Remember back in the days when it was acetate
Technics, 1210, Mark II's and dubplate
But you ain't heard, that's absurd
But get used to it, cause I'm a party animal
Lunatic, damn it, troll
Out of control, control, control
Like headset to X-Flow
Take it down and turn it up (come on)
Party people, party more
Take it down and turn it up (boom)
Rock stand bang like a rock band
You hammered a hard game to take over your block man
Rock stand bang like a rock band
You hammered a hard game to take over your block man
Body people bottom up
Take it down and turn it up
Body people bottom up
Take it down and turn it up
Body people bottom up
Take it down and turn it up
Body people bottom up
Take it down and turn it up (Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)
Party people, you oughta love it
Take it down and turn it up (Bang, bang, bang, bang)
Rock standing like a rock band
You have the heart game to take over your block, man
Rock standing like a rock band
You have the heart game to take over your block man
Rock standing like a rock band
You have the heart game to take over your block, man
Rock standing like a rock band
You have the heart game to take over your block, man
