The night is ours, the stars align (Burning glow)
Your touch unites, it feels divine (Golden light)
We lose ourselves to music leads (Electric soul)
A love that flows, a heart that beats (Timeless wave)
Your eyes are fire, they pull me in (fade to stars)
This game of love, we play to win (rise and play)
The floor is ours, no end in sight (blazing spark)
We're burning bright, beneath the night (in a dream)
Dance with me, feel the night unfold (we won't slide)
Let the rhythm take our hold (let them fly, fly)
Every step is a story told
Together here our love so bold
Endless fire
The night is ours, the stars align
Your touch ignites, it feels divine
We lose ourselves, the music meets, electric soul
I love the throes, the heart that beats, timeless way
Your eyes are fire, they fill me in, freeing stars
This game of love, we'll play the way, rise and play
The floor is ours, no end in sight, blazing spark
We're burning bright, beneath the night
Dance with me, feel the night unfold
Let the rhythm take a hold
Every step is a story told
Together here our love so bold
Feeling me, feel the night unfold
Oh shall I, let the rhythm take a hold
Live in fire
Every step is a story told
Cold as fire
Together here, our love's so bold
Live in fire
