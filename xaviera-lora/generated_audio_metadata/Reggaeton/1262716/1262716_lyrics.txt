Oh, oh, oh
We're burning on the dance floor feeling your energy
Give me a glance now, get caught in your synergy
Your hips don't lie under the neon lights
Lost in the rhythm with you
Feels so right
Under the moonlight
Bodies intertwine
Heartbeat to the rhythm
Like a sweetest rhyme
As the bass drops
We're lifting high
This is our moment
No goodbyes
Swaying the music like the waves hit the shore
Exploring the rhythm always wanting more
Your gaze pulls me closer under the tropical sun
In the rhythm of the night two hearts beating as one
Under the moonlight like a gentle tide
Hearts in the rhythm no place to hide
As the beat drops
We're soaring high
In this melody of love
No goodbyes
Rhythm like fire, passion invincible
You and I baby, we're indivisible
In the rhythm of the whispers under the starry skies
With every beat drop
Love amplifies
Under the moonlight
Hands intertwine
Caught in the rhythm
Lost in the time
As the night fades
We're soaring high
In this dance of ours
No goodbyes
This dance of ours under the neon glow
Caught in the rhythm, never letting go
As the daylight breaks, we're flying high
In the rhythm of love
