I remember when we were staring a photo
Don't et the way you looked me in the eyes
And I keep you in my heart
And my heart is where you are
I still think of you, I want you coming back
Call me when you want
Baby I can't take it on my own
Yeah yeah
Give me your love
Yeah yeah
Call me when you want, baby can't take it in my heart, oh, yeah, yeah
Give me your love, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Call me when you want, baby can't take it in my heart, oh, yeah, yeah
Give me your love, yeah, yeah
Call me when you want, baby can't take in my heart, oh, yeah, yeah
Give me your love, yeah, yeah, yeah
