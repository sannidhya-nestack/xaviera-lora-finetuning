It's a fine night
Underneath your lights
A face right in the traffic breeze
Your eyes caught mine
Lost in time
Got a feeling this isn't ordinary
Turn the rhythm on
We're dancing close
Let's never stop
Caught in the tide of this Caribbean night
With a beat in our hearts we collide
All so right
Underneath the magic of the Latin night
Then I'll smell right
Underneath the magic of the Latin night
When the city vibrates
This ain't no mistake
Your glowing skin in the moonlight whisper
The swaying of your hips, those soft spoken lips
Creating rhythms we'll always remember
Flip the music, I feel the waves, let the rum drop
Lost in our zone in the clamor alone as the stars align we ignite another twilight
In our tropical haven of the Latin night
You know so right underneath the magic of the Latin night
Hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah, hey yeah hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey, hey-ya
Shaken to the rhythm
Our bodies intertwining
Sweeter than the sunsets
On the ocean lining
Oh, I
Let our spirits take the spotlight
Two hearts lost in time
In the rhythm of the twilight
With this pulsing sound
We unite in a dance fight
Immersed in the mystery
Of the Latin night
Hey ya ya ya ya ya ya
Hey ya ya ya
Hey ya hey ya ya ya ya
Hey ya
