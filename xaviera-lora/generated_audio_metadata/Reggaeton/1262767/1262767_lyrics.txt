(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) (Yeah, yeah)
Nidandanin dalman daasal yung sun, ole
Your silhouette moves with the melody
With every beat our hearts become weighed
We are free just like a song on this endless sea
We're moving to the wind, I lose control
Your eyes are shining, they behold
Our bodies sway, stories unfold
In the sound of the night, secrets are told
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-eh-eh-eh-eh
Ooh-eh-eh-eh
Ooh-eh-eh-eh
Their feet on the white sand dance floor
The rhythm guides us asking for more
With every beat we explore
This tropical vibe'til the dawn knocks on the door
In this dance in this unknown
A barefoot ballet of love unshown
When sunset comes stars are blown
In your arms I've found a home
Moving to the rhythm lose control
Your eyes are shining, they behold
A body sway, stories unfold
In the sound of the night, secrets I've told
Move into the beat, touch the soul
Underneath the stars, we're yet enrolled
A body sway, stories unfold
In your arms, I surrender control
Our dance on the sand comes to a pause
With the rising sun the night withdraws
Yet in our hearts the rhythm roars
Forever we dance with no remorse
Move into the rhythm lose control
Your eyes are shining they behold
Our bodies sway stories unfold
In the sound of the night secrets are told
Nothing to the beat touch the soul
Underneath the stars we have been rolled
Our bodies sway, stories unfold
In your arms I surrender, control
Ooh, ooh, ooh-leh-leh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-leh-leh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-leh-leh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-leh-leh
Ooh-leh-leh, ooh-leh-leh
