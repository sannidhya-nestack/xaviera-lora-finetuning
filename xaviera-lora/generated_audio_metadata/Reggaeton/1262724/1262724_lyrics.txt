Underneath the neon skies, arise the hypnotized
Swaying to the rhythm, we're leaving all behind
Let sun sinks down low, sparks an island glow
In the echoes of the sea, you and I begin to flow
Tonight, we're dancing free with the rhythm
The key to the bond that we've grown
In this dance, our love is sure
Stars reflect in your eyes
As we groove to the night's surprise
Caught in rhythm
Under the moon's disguise
Your touch is my sweet escape
And your arms love take shape
Dancing in harmony
No feelings to misshape
Tonight we're dancing free
With the rhythm the key
To the bond that we've grown
In this dance our love is shown
Stars reflect in your eyes as we grew to the night surprise
Caught in the rhythm under the moon disguise
Your touch is my sweet escape in your arms
Love takes shape, dancing in harmony
No feelings too much shade
Turn the music loud, lost in this crowd
With you I found my rhythm, our love no end or bound
Tonight we're dancing free with the rhythm
The key to the bond that we've grown
In this dance, our love is shown
Stars reflect in your eyes as we groove to the night's surprise
Caught in the rhythm, under the moon's azure
