Feeling young gold
Where the palm trees sway
You and I we dance the night away
A beat that drums right to our core
We've never felt a rhythm like this before
Underneath these shimmering city lights
Body to body oh what a sight
This energy is hard to contain
Feeling your heartbeat driving me insane
Love is a melody
We're just finding more tune
Dancing'til dawn under the tropical moon
Your touch is a rhythm
Can't ignore
I found the song that I've been looking for
Feel the heat let's lose control
Your love taking over your love is my soul
Close your eyes and hold on tight
In this dance we own the night
As the music fades under the sunrise we sway
A night spending dance no words can portray
In the silence, our rhythm remains
An endless beat, love's sweet refrain
Underneath these shimmering city lights
Body to body, oh what a sight
This energy is hard to contain
