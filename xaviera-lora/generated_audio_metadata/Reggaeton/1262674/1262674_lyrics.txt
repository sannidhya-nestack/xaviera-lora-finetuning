Yeah, working on the beat like this, the sun goes down now
Big foot on the sand, we dance to the reggae sound
Big clouds around, got the palm trees sway
Lost in the rhythm, let the music play
Feel the night with the island beat so tight
In the moonlight, your silhouette wet, sets my heart alight
We be dancing, we be dancing
Underneath the starry sky it's enchanting
Feeling the warmth of a summer breeze
Lost in the glow feeling at ease
With the beat of the drum and the strum of the guitar
Round the fire, under the moon and the stars
Up on our feet as the rhythm takes control
Feel the night's magic, let the good times roll
With the waves as they soft, we kiss the shore
Live in the moment, what we came here for
We be dancing, we be dancing
Underneath the starry sky it's enchanting
Feeling the warmth of the summer breeze
Lost in the groove feeling at ease
With the waves, let's face off, we kiss the shore
Living the moment, what we came here for
We be dancing, we be dancing
Living our dreams in this tropical romancing
Feeling the warmth of the summer breeze
Lost in the groove feeling at ease
We keep dancing under the Caribbean skies
We be dancing, we be dancing
Underneath the slurry sky
It's enchanting in the tropical light
Can't have a chance
'Til the moon goes down and the sun begins to rise
But we keep dancing under the canopy of skies
When we be dancing, we be dancing, we be dancing
