Hey, she can turn up, get beyond
A little faster, move your feet
We're on a beach, feel the heat
Underneath the shining stars where we meet
She got the rhythm, she got the grace
Going like a flame, bright as a chase
Moving in sync to the bass
And with each beat my heart races in pace
Dancing in moonlight under the palm trees sway
As we sway, we lose ourselves in the salty breeze
Just you and me in our paradise day
Living our dreams in tropical ease
Her laughter's like a melody
In this world of ours there's no boundary
Let the waves crash and set free
As we dance through the night just you and me
Dancing in the moonlight under the palm tree sway
And as we sway we lose ourselves in the salty breeze
Just you and me in our paradise play
Living our dreams in tropical ease
Living our dreams in tropical ease
As the sun paints the sky with this first night
We're still lost in each other's sight
The night might end but our hearts are tight
In this moonlit pop reggae night
Dancing in the moonlight under the palm tree sway
As we sway we lose ourselves in the salty breeze
Just you and me in our paradise play
Living our dreams in tropical ease
Living our dreams in tropical ease
