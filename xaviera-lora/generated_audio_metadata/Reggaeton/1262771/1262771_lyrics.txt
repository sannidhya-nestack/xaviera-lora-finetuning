Bom-bom-bom-bom, salty air breathing
Swing to the rhythm, let the night begin
Can you feel the heat? Dancing skin to skin
This ain't a dream, let's dive right in
Move into the rhythm, all still in the beat
In the mood to flex, in our eyes meet
Tonight's the night, no room for defeat
Feel the energy rise, let it beat
Feel the sand beneath our feet
This beat's so sweet
Can't resist the cheat
Tonight's the vibe, so discreet
Under the stars, ain't this neat
Moving to the rhythm, lost in the beat
In the moon's reflection, our eyes meet
Tonight's the night, no room for defeat
Feel the energy rise, let it heat
Got the rhythm
Got the pace
No room for second
We're in this chase
Dance with me under this silent space
Tonight's our story
Our saving grace
As the dawn breaks under the morning glow with the music fading slow-mo
