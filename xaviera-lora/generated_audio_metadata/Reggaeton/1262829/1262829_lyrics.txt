Diamonds in the sky tonight
This rhythm's feeling so right
Passion in your eyes ignites
Lost in this tropical delight
We're dancing under the moonlight
Heat rising, bodies rolling tight
Our hearts are soaring in flight
This is our tropical night
The waves are crashing in tune
Underneath this taking bloom
With a passion as bright as the full moon
Feeling the love we're gonna consume
We're dancing under the starlight
Hearts beating all through the night
In the echoes of our delight
This is our tropical night
Can you feel the rhythm in the air?
