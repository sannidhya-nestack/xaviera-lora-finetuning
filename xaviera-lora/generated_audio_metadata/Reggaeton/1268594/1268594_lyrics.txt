People arrive with bright shirts on, white hats to shade them from the sun
All drums bass, the music's hum, everybody's having fun
Come along, go along, take me by the hand
It's Calypso time in Trinidad
Come along, come along, oh, you understand
It's Calypso time in Trinidad
The music plays into the night
For the young and old alike
Penny here for everyone
Take what you like
Oh yeah
And I'm going there with no shoes on
Hey little girl won't you come along
Add your sweet voice to the song
Now the carnival is on
Come along, come along, take me by the hand
It's Calypso time in Cheridad
Oh, come along girl, I know you'll understand
It's Calypso time in Trinidad
I said I'm going there with no shoes on
Hey little girl won't you come along
Add your sweet voice to the song
Now the carnival is on
Come along, come along, take me by the hand
It's Calypso time in Trinidad
Come along girl, I know you'll understand
Heaven or earth time
It's Calypso time in Trinidad
Sha-la-la-la-la
Come along, come along, take me by the hand
It's collapsed so time and change it
Come along, come along, know you understand
It's collapsed so time and change it
