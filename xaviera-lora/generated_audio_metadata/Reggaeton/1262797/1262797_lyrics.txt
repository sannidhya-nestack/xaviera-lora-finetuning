Oh baby feel the heat of the night
Moving our bodies in the calm moonlight
Your touch, your gaze got me hypnotized
In the rhythm my heart synchronized
Oh darling under these traffic lights
And every beat our spirits ignite
Move with me let your soul be free
To the rhythm of our shared melody
Her hips sway in tune with my heart
A dance of desire right from the start
Caught in a trance, under the stars
The rhythm of the night, it's all ours
Our hips sway, in tune with my heart
A dance of desire right from the start
Caught in a trance, under the stars
The rhythm of the night, it's all ours
Oh honey, feel the rhythm in our veins
In this dance only love remains
Sway with me to our soul, just song
In this moment nothing can go wrong
Your touch, your smile
It's a tantalizing game
In the rhythm, we're burning like a flame
Close your eyes, let the music take control
Feel the beat, it's the rhythm of our soul
As the sun rises, our dances fade
But the rhythm of our hearts it never slays
With the setting sun, we shall return
To dance under the stars
For our love will always burn
