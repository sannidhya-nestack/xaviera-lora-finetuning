Huh, huh
We're gonna meet the girl, got the rhythm playing
Underneath the sun and shine, let's sway away, yeah
Feeling the vibe, letting it flow
In a world where only we know
Dancing in the moonlight, stars on our side
With the rhythm we take flight
No over fear, just the beat
With the melody our hearts mean
Watch us dancing, moving, yeah yeah yeah
Under the moonlight, grooving, oh oh
Caught in the magic of the night
Living like there's no end in sight
Electric energy sparking bright
Lost in the rhythm, pure delight
No walls, just an open field
And the melody will reveal
Laughing under the moon, breathing the air
In this moment nothing is there
All tied in this beautiful dance
In this rhythm we take our chance
In the swaying, moving, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Under the moonlight, grooving, oh oh, oh oh
Caught in the magic of the night
Living like there's no end in sight
That's the night of the moon
Breathe in the air
In this moment nothing is fair
All tied in this beautiful dance
In this rhythm we take our chance
Feel us swaying, moving, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Underneath the stars, moving, oh-oh, oh-oh
Locked in the beauty of the night
Lost in the rhythm, choke the light
As the night comes under the glow
In the rhythm, we lose control
Feel us moving, swaying, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
In the rhythm, we're playing, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Dancing under moonlight beam
Caught in a beautiful dream
