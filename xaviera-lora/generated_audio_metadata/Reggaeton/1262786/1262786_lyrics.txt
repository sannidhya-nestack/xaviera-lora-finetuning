Feeling the beat on this tropical night
Under the blimmers of the street light
Holding together bodies tight
In your eyes I find my light
Hand in hand walking on the coastline
Your sweet whispers send shivers down my spine
Under the moon soft shine
In this moment your heart is mine
Dancing on the rhythm sweet and slow
With the music, letting our feelings flow
Nothing but the stars above and the globe
Tonight it's just about us two, don't you know
I was laying on the rhythm having a good time
Wrapped in your arms feeling sublime
To the music our hearts chime
In this melody we're intertwined
Skin to skin beneath the palm tree
In this dance we find our spree
Under the night sky wild and free
In your arms is where I want to be
Dancing on the rhythm sweet and slow
With the music letting our feelings flow
Nothing but the stars above and the glow
Tonight it's just about us two, don't you know?
In this dance we find our connection
Lost in the rhythm and the night's perfection
All in your arms I find my direction
Tonight this dance is our soul's reflection
Tonight it's just about us two, don't you know
Tonight it's just about us two, don't you know
Tonight it's just about us two, don't you know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
