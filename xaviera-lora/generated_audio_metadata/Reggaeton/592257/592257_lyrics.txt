Yeah, you heard this story before
Girl wants the bad boy
Now everybody she knows say he ain't no good but
Ain't nothing gonna change her mind
Todo mi amor es para ti
My love is in the air
All my love is for you baby
Todo mi amor es para ti
No matter what they say
All my love is for you baby
The things she looking for (what she wants)
Ain't nothing new (what she wants)
Just a little excitement
With something or someone to do (that's what she wants)
I can't stick in that crooked streak (oh no)
Cause it's etched in time (in time)
She does what she wants (yeah)
And sends what's on her mind
She says
Por mi amor es para ti
When I'm sitting in the air (oh my love)
It's for you baby
Todo mi amor es para ti
No matter what they say
All my love is for you baby
People say you're wrong, but you believe you're right
They say he's bad news, but you say they just can't see his light
Time will tell, time will show
Where will she be, where will her love go
Still she said, "Doronio"
All my love is for you baby, love is in the air
Puedo sentirlo (la vez en diez)
Te quiero (la vez en diez)
Te necesito (la vez en diez)
Bailar conmigo (la vez en diez)
Puedo sentirlo (la vez en diez)
Te quiero (la vez en diez)
Te necesito (la vez en diez)
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (It's all for me, I'm all, it's all I need)
When I'm sitting here (All my love is for you, baby) it's all for you (It's all for me, I'm all)
All of my love (It's all I need) it's all for you (No matter what they say) well (All my love is for you, baby)
Puedo sentirlo (la vez en diez)
Te quiero (la vez en diez)
Te necesito (la vez en diez)
Bailar conmigo (la vez en diez)
