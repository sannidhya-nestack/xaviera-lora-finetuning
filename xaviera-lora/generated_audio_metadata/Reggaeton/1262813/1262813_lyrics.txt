(Tell me all your dreams, tell me all your love, you'll see it through)
(Sweet pain, that's what we do)
(Face it, don't look me in your eyes)
(You're shining, you're getting the stars)
(We need the rhythm, we don't care where we are)
We're dancing, we're dreaming on the constellation sky
Lost in the rhythm where the ocean meets the night
Your hands, my heart
We're making a start, feels like we're painting a beautiful work of art
Drunk as a DJ playing the song
So crashing waves where we belong
Your laughter rings over the beat
In a time of rhythm it's becoming so sweet
We're dancing, we're dreaming
On the constellation sky
Lost in the rhythm
Where the ocean meets the night
You touch my rhythm
We're by the beach intertwined with rhythm
It's becoming so sweet
We're dancing, we're dreaming on the constellation sky
Lost in the rhythm where the ocean meets the night
Your touch, my rhythm, we're making a start
Feels like we're painting a beautiful work of art
No more calls like a weapon, but
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
When there's our DJ playing the songs
Of crashing waves where we belong
Your laughter rings over the beat
Intertwined with rhythm, it's becoming so sweet
When there's our DJ playing the songs
Of crashing waves where we belong
Your laughter rings over the beat
Intertwined with rhythm, it's becoming so sweet
To win the night closer let's dance until dawn
Against the rhythm we are beautifully drawn
In this dance of life we share and unwind
We could beat the rhythm our hearts are aligned
We're dancing we're dreaming on the constellation sky
Lost in the rhythm
Where the ocean meets the night
Your touch my rhythm
We're making a start
Feels like we're painting
A beautiful work of art
House for the heart
Oh, oh, oh
Come a bit closer
Let's dance until dawn
