One more night, one more night, one more chance, baby, hey
One more night, one more chance, in a train, baby, hey
One more night, one more chance, in a train, honey, hey
Once upon a time in a train
I met a beautiful lady
Travelling down to Malawi
Coming down from Blawayoi over the train
We chatted
We sitting close to each other
She smiled
She whispered in my ears
Telling me her name
How to say my name back to her
She was so excited baby
She promised to love me
And I promised to love her
In the train overnight
Oh, I, in a train, in a train, in a train
In a train, in a train, in a train to Malawi
In a train, I met a beautiful lady
She was looking so pretty baby
She smiled, she whispered in my ears, telling me the name
And I saved my name back to have never had the chance to see that letter again in my life
But I wish and I hope one day she'll give me a second chance
So baby just give me one more night in a dream again (one more night in a dream hey hey)
I say give me one more chance I wanna prove myself to you
Give me one more night in a dream, in a dream baby
I miss you darling so give me one more night
Give me one more chance in a dream
In a train, I met a pretty, eous lady
Looking so beautiful
I've never had a chance to meet that lady again
Give me one more chance, give me one more night
I wanna prove myself to you
Give me one more night
Give me one more chance in a train again baby
Give me one more night
Give me one more chance in a train
I'll say give me one more chance again in the dream
Remember one more night, one more night in the dream hey hey
One more night, one more night
The way you smile, the way you walk away
One more night, one more chance

One more night, one more chance
In a dream, honey, hey
All of my dreams by myself
