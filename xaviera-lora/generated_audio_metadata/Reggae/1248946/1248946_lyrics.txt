Morning light rays, they call us true
Rise up strong, gotta see it through
World turns round, sky so blue
Slow back down, it's up to you
Children play, their joy so bright
In their eyes, the fight for right
Voice so clear, beyond the night
Shout it out, rise up to the light
Stand tall, don't delay
Freedom song, come what may
Hold the line, make them sway
Stand for what's yours today
Dusty roads, the journey long
United hearts, make us strong
Simple tunes, a reggae song
Feel the beat, join the throng
Through the pain, the struggle true
Hearts of gold, skies so blue
Hands held high
Me and you, stand up strong
Let us break through
Let stars guide through the night
Hope's the fire burning bright
In the dark there's the light
Stand up tall for what's right
Dusty roads, the journey long
United hearts make us strong
Simple tunes, a reggae song
Feel the beat join the throng
Through the fires guide through the night
Hopes your fire burns bright
