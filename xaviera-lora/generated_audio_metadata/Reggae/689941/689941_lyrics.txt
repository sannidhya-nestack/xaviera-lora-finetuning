I'm going away, going away
I don't want to stay, going away
I'm going away, going away
I don't want to stay, going away
Everybody knows how hard I tried
Gave it all I had, that's no lie
So I'm gonna move, nothing left to lose
Now I'm on my way, so goodbye
First I lost my job then lost my car
So I had to walk can't go very far
Then I lost my home feeling all alone
Now I want to find my lucky star
I'm going away, going away
I don't want to stay, going away
I'm going away, going away
I don't want to stay, going away
When I find a place to rest my head
Get another job and make some bread
I'll tell you what I've found
And when to come around
So don't you worry that I'm dead
I'm going away, going away
I don't want to stay, going away
I'm going away, going away
I don't want to stay, going away
I'm going away, going away
I don't want to stay, going away
I'm going away, going away
I don't want to stay, going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
