Make you believe
Make you believe
You say you don't need a big relationship
Not to say it again
You say you're not ready for commitment
Not just yet
So tell me, are you happy?
I want you to be happy
Tell me how you'll get by
Without me by your side
Tell me that you need me and I
I'll show you I can be your tower of strength
I'll show you, I'll make you believe (make you believe)
I'll show you, I'll make all the world make sense
I'll show you, you need me
Come crystallize all your feelings and you'll find the love that we share
And open your eyes and don't you know that we can start all over again
So tell me, are you happy? I want you to be happy
Tell me how you'll get by without me by your side
Tell me that you need me and I
I'll show you I can be your tower of strength
I'll show you, I'll make you believe
I'll show you, I'll make all the world make sense
I'll show you, I'll show you, you need
I'll show you that you need my love (I'm gonna show you that you need my love)
I'll show you that you need my love
I'm gonna show you that you need my love
I'll show you that you need my love
I'm gonna show you that you need my love (I'm gonna show you)
I'm gonna show you that you need my love
I'll show you I can be your tower of strength
I'll show you I'll make you believe
I'll show you I'll make all the world make sense
I'll show you
