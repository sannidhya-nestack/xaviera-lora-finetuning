Found you alone over midfire
'Cause I feel not a pleasure now
For you I love another mid-five
I feel not a pleasure now
For you I love another mid-five
I feel not a pleasure now
For you I love another mid-five
I feel not a pleasure now
I went away, I went away, I went away, I went away
I went away, I went away, I went way, I went away
Ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta
Ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta
Cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha
Cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha
