Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
There is a drought in my mind
My thoughts are covered in the sand
I try to find a water source
A river or an ocean ghost
Who might help with what I seek?
Can't believe it's so hard to think of one way out
Out this heat
How will it end?
I don't feel like I need to correct
This absolute mess that I make
With every single breath I take
A silver drought in my mind
And a father's drowning me, alright
Completely blind, completely blind
I poured my tears in a glass
Watered my plants
And drank the rest, and drank the rest
From drought to flood, so obscene
That's my very own inner evergreen
That's my very own inner evergreen
It is that drains my mind, whatever makes me write these rhymes
It is that drains my mind, whatever makes me write these rhymes
Who might help with what I seek
Can't believe it's so hard to think of one way out
Out this heat
How will it end?
I don't feel like I need to correct
This absolute mess that I make
With every single breath I take
I still have drought in my mind
And a father's drowning me
Alright, completely blind
Completely blind
I poured my tears in a glass
Watered my plans
And drank the rest
And drank the rest
From drought to flood
So obscene
That's my very own inner evergreen
That's my very own inner evergreen
Ooh, it is that drains my mind
Whatever makes me write these rhymes
It is that drains my mind
Whatever makes me write these rhymes
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
