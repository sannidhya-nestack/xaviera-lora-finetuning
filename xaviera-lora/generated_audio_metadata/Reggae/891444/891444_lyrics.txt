Touch and talk, kiss and cuddle, blood rush from my heart, skip a beat so sudden
Put in the bass, take out the treble, this feel like heaven
The rain set up outside, gal all your body feel so wet up inside
Yeah, yeah, like a you a bring the rain but a pain and pleasure when me get up inside
Listen, this is the moment baby girl this is the time
Dinner and dine can be light with red wine
Me full of passion and it's sweet like pine
Jumping at the bench, Jeep girl make the seat recline
Cock up your foot, relax and let me drive
Take you to somewhere for us to see the moonlight
Me nah lie, me love how you body right
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right

Never get a girl with a body so right
Girl you're sitting to fit me like me clocks and me Nike
While you by me side every night
Girl me want you

Overlook the city intimate

Simple mean we a go reach far, we did a pray the moon
Now we a pray the stars, heal all your wounds, erase your scars
Take you with all your flaws, put you up and play and put them girl up and pause cause
