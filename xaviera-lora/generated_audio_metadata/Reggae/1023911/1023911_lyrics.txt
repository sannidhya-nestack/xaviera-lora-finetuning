Yeah, we don't know say on this journey called life
Might lose some money, might lose some friends
But above all, make sure say don't lose yourself
Watch this, I miss the old me
No matter where dem tryna negative ya old me
I'm taking back my life now, I'm in control of me
And I should have listened to what mama told me
Now I miss the old me (speak quiet)
Have you ever been blessed but you still stress
Doing better but you still care invest
So you lose interest then you're in dress
All the bad mind negative mindset
Don't fret I saw the things set
The next days ahead are the best ones yet call it
Nobody make you feel like less
A rushing people claim you are the greatest
I've been through so many tests
Now me walk with purpose in every step
No second guess
Cause the one who said I'm real them are the fakers
That's why me big up me own chest
Now I miss the old me
No matter what them try no negative ya old me
I'm taking back my life now I'm in control of me
I no shoulda listen to what mama told me
Now I miss the old me, go dey go dey go dey
Me dream big like a skyscraper
Dem say have patience but we a no waiter
Or no doctor, more like an actor
Make moves collect the paper
Rush the haters off me like this
Think up on me real friend who never would switch
Stage up in hits like we just can't miss
Cause we a the champion and never should dis
Call me what you wish, still we nah go call it quits
Cause the music make people jump and twist
I try a thing but I was born for this
When me tune drop ya girl I say that's my shhh
This Paul to the Anthony and let's face it
Everybody won't like me but when I touch the mic I shine so brightly
I don't know anybody like me
I miss the old me
No matter when dem try no negative ya old me
I'm taking back my life now, I'm in control of me
And I shoulda listened to what mama told me
Now I miss the old me
Yeah I miss the old me
No matter what dem try no negative can't hold me
I'm taking back my life now, I'm in control of me
And I should have listened to what mama told me (yeah, yeah)
Now I miss the old me
