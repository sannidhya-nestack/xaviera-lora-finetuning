Life is the greatest
Thanks to the Most High
I wanna see a world of peace
Where Christians, Jews and Muslims live good in the Middle East
Flow like the wind and I say cool as the breeze
I wanna see all war cease
I'm begging please
I say a prayer down on bending knees
From Saudi Arabia to Yemen we want to see some peace again
Unity in Israel Palestine Jerusalem
Pakistan Afghanistan now upon who a comprehend
We don't need no nuclear war because the world it a going now
One God one aim one destiny it's love without pretence
Free the people from the bondage and a build no wire fence
If you say Allah Yahweh God just heal his name with excellence
And let him in your residence, yo
I wanna see a world of peace
Where christians, jews and muslims live good in the middle east
Flow like the wind and I say cool as the breeze
I wanna see a world cease
I'm begging please
I say a prayer down on bending knees
Syria, Lebanon, Iraq to Iran, Libya to Sudan
Don't drop no more bomb, we a one race and it don't matter where you from
Black and white and we have different religion
Divided we gon fall, together we stand strong
And we don't need another Magidion
I wanna see a world of peace
Where christian jews and muslims live good in the middle
I wanna see a world of peace
Where Christians, Jews and Muslims live good in the Middle East
Flow like the wind and I say cool as the breeze
I wanna see our war cease
I'm begging please
I say a prayer down on bending knees
From Saudi Arabia to Yemen we want to see some peace again
Unity in Israel, Palestine, Jerusalem, Pakistan, Afghanistan
Now upon who a comprehend
We don't need no nuclear war because the world it a going now
One God one aim one destiny it's love without pretence
Free the people from the bandage and a build no wire fence
If you say Allah Yahweh God just hail his name with excellence
And let him in your residence yo
I wanna see a world of peace
Where Christians, Jews and Muslims live good in the Middle East
Flow like the wind and I say cool as the breeze
I wanna see all wars cease
I'm begging please
I say a prayer down on bending knees
