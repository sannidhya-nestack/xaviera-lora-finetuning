Me say, day by day
Me just can't seem to find a way
The same old thing, no joy, no play
Me feel like me just been nobody else's way
From sun up to sun down
Stuck inna this town
No excitement fi be found
Me heart giving down
Every morning is the same routine
Wake up, work, eat, sleep, be free
They say, this life ain't no suite
We need something to make me feel complete
But we don't know where to turn
Seems like we're so starved for blood
This boredom it make me yearn
For your change, for your listen, to learn
So we look to the sky
I'ma start to ask why
We want to spread new wings and fly
Leave behind the same old life
Let me say day by day
They just can't seem to find a way
This is what they now try to play
I feel like red has been my body has laid
But me no give up up me no quit
Me know there's more to life than this
Me go keep pushing sure me go persist one day
Me find me bliss
I'ma not give up, I'ma not quit
I know there's more to life than this
Nigga keep pushing through, I'ma go persist
One day, I'll find the bliss
Every morning is the same routine
Wake up, work, eat, sleep, repeat
I say, this life ain't no sweet
You need something to make me feel complete
Coming on over the dirt
Seems like my soul's gone for burnt
This boredom it made me learn
Be a change, be a lesson to learn
So I'ma look to the sky
I'ma start to ask why
I want to spread new wings and fly
Leave behind the same old life
I'ma not give up, I'ma not quit
I know there's more to life than this
Nigga keep pushing, show me how to persist
One day, I'll find the blame
Every morning is the same routine
Wake up, work, eat, sleep, repeat, we say
This life ain't no sweet, we need something to make me feel complete
Thought we'd not be, thought we'd not be
But now there's more to life than this
We don't need to change who we're supposed to be
One day, we'll find the bliss
