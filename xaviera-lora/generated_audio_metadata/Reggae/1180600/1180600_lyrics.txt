I've been good to you, I have treated you right
Sticking together, we were so tight
Only this once did we have a fight
Next thing I know, you were out of my life
Hey girl
Why did you walk out on me?
Hey girl
Will you come back to me?
Hey girl
Why did you walk out on me?
Hey girl, will you come back to me?
Now all that I am is memories
I'm living my life in fantasies
Remember how were good times together
Sweet memories makes me feel better
Hey girl, why did you walk out on me
Hey girl, will you come back to me
Hey girl, why did you walk out on me
Hey girl, will you come back to me
Well, I've been good to you, I have treated you right
Sticking together, we were so tight
Only this once did we have a fight
Next thing I know, you were out of my life, hey girl
Why did you walk out on me?
Hey girl, will you come back to me?
Hey girl, why did you walk out on me?
Hey girl
Will you come back to me?
Now all that I have is memories
I'm living my life in fantasies
Remembering how we're good times together
Sweet memories makes me feel better
Hey girl
Why did you walk out on me?
Hey girl, will you come back to me?
Hey girl, why did you walk out on me?
Hey girl, will you come back to me?
Hey girl, why did you walk out on me?
Whoa girl
