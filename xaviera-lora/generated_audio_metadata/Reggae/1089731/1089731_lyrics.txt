Time is longer than rope them say greedy
It make puppy dog choke
Many ways to hang a dog
You have to put rope on him throat
You come to hear some things that take place before the time
Ask a fifteen year old girl turn mad there before time
Ask some young man turn big man before time
No for dem a put hero look like a nine
If a man hurt you just leave him to time
No go inna jail and dem don't do no crime
No go inna prison spend a long long time
Dem a wish if dem could turn back the hands of time
No for dem a tell me fi wait pon time
No for dem a tell me it's not my time
No for young do give it them life before the time
Young girl leave them yard before the time
So many thing deh pon sugar de mine
No few join the wrong crew before the time
No few out a road a fire dem nine
And when dem reach a jail dem a look pon time it a run
Time is longer than rope dem say greedy
It make puppy dog chote
Time is longer than rope
Many ways to hang a dog you na have to put rope a him chote
Time is longer than rope, dem say greedy
It make pop it have choke, ooh
Time is longer than rope
Many way to hang a dog, you nuh have to put rope and choke
Me see some little fruit tree, way before the time
Have some little mango tree, way before the time
Me see some little ackee tree, way before the time
Have some little lime tree, way before the time
But when you see dem thing, it just wonders and sighs
Have some little goat kid, have kid before the time
Have some little dog pop, have pop
Before the time, before the God soon come
But no man no know the time, has a serious crime a go on
And no man can stop the time
Me a play to the murder of dem fi resign
Youth man don't rush it, just wait on time
What's the time? April the master is the time
Me a talk to the people dem inna this a time
Listen to me word and no rhyme, me a rhyme
Listen Sugar D, one more time
The ready for me, all dem no belongs to me
Time is longer than rope
Them say greedy, it make puppy dog choke
Time is longer than rope
Many ways to hang a dog
You na have to put up a fine throat
Time is longer than rope
Them say greedy, it make puppy dog choke
Time is longer than rope
Many ways to hang a dog
You na have to put up a fine throat
No do the crime and no one do no time
I direct my pleasure in the morning time
I ask father god to wipe out all bad minds
Me no say time rough but me no have a time
I rather buy a pound of sugar and squeeze two lime
Youth man go and work and wait upon time
Wait diligently the next time is your time
Exercise some faith and wait upon time because
Nothing no done before the time
What belongs to you it cannot be mine
Them words are them written from ancient time
Just look inna the book and open up your mind
We living in a world with wonders and signs
You will see a lot of thing that blow your mind
Put your faith inna the Lord and strengthen your mind
Listen sugar, did I tell you one more time, let me tell you now
Time is longer than a rope, them say greedy
It make puppy dog choke, ooh
Time is longer than a rope
Many ways to hang a dog, you know how to put you up, I'm so glad
Time is longer than a rope, them say greedy
It make puppy dog choke, ooh
Time is longer than a rope
Many ways to hang a dog, you know how put you up, I'm so glad
Time is longer than rope, dem say greedy
It make puppy dog choke
Time is longer than rope
Many ways to hang a dog, you no have to put rope, I'm so sad
Mi a tell deh a dem star
So much time mi a tell deh a dem say ive dem self
Because time will catch up on you
