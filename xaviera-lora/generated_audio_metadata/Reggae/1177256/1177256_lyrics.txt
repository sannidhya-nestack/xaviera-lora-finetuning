Why is love so much confusion?
Mixed up emotions, a lasting illusion
How many years, spend a year long time with this pain
But a damn sick stomach, a gigantic migraine (yes I)
Head full of promise, now me pon lonely lane
As me reboot him off the toba baby which drain water run from me I
Even couldn't stop cry
Drop to me knees ask father god why
Anything that she want I woulda give her this time
Put her hooks inna me heart then she walk out of me life
Sometimes me feel she do the whole thing fi spite (fi spite)
The whole thing not right (the whole thing not right)
Sometimes it feels you do the whole thing for spite (for spite)
The whole thing not right, say why is love
So much confusion
Mixed up emotions
A lasting illusion
Why is love
So much confusion, mixed up emotions, a lasting illusion, yeah
I can remember all the time the little things that we share
Moments together in my blue cavalier
Staring into the sky with twinkles in my eye
Making all times a promises we never say
Having dinner with your family each and every Sunday night
Pardon me for a second, let me please dry my eye
The recollection so deep, it make me shudder and cry
All the children you want to call and say hi
To wish me a happy birthday, me a wonder say why (say why)
The whole thing not right (the whole thing not right)
So tell me if you see do the whole thing fist fight (fist fight)
The whole thing not right, why is love?
So much confusion, mixed up emotions, a lasting illusion
Why is love, so much confusion, mixed up emotions
A last thing in Luzon today
Yeah my dawg say I got it bad mean
And I got it good mean
And if a brother could
Then you know a brother would
Man read his broad till death do his part
And they always say it takes a broken heart
Not to break her heart
But obviously she never been done wrong
Never felt the pain never real love gone wrong
Singing like Neo
Sick of hearing love songs
Play Biggie and Pac
Just to hear thug songs
So crank the track
Bounce back and hold your hand high, cause this how we get by
So crank the track, bounce back and hold your hand high
Cause this how we get by
Why is love (why is love this way) so much confusion
Mixed up emotions, a lasting illusion (illusion)
Why is love (why is love this way) so much confusion (why is love this way)
Mixed up emotions, a lasting illusion (I don't understand this thing called love)
Why is love, why is love this way
It's an illusion, yeah
I don't understand this thing, think of love
Why is love, why is love, why is love this way
I don't understand
Why you love this way?
Na na na, na na na, na na na, oh way
