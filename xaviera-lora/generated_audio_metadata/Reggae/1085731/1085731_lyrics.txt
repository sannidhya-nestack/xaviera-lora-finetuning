Hey Ajuta, son of a different miss Heidi
Talk to Tully let him lively step aside
And I say everything is everything though
Shoot a mix today

Every riddim have a treat in it
Every bull and every bun this kid got sweet in it
My fire got heat in it
Some man a meditate down deep in it
In it, achi my tweak in it
And this id where you saw, ya reap in it
Cup o' boat, who keep in it?
Cup o' bed a me sleep in it

Every station have a cop inna dem, DJ inna rap inna dem

Every rhythm have a beat in it, every pulla every bun this kid got sweet in it

I chip my cake in it, and the seed where you sow, you reap in it
Cup o' bowl, who keep in it, cup o' bed and me sleep in it, ha-ha, ha-ha

Yo, once weh me a seat in it, my past my seem in it
My shoes my feet in it, and the mission complete in it
My food dem can't eat in it

Every TV got a cartoon in it
Oh, cup of house, cup of room in it
My yard, my broom in it

One sky, one moon in it
One die, one tomb in it
This a tune got a boom in it
This a camera a zoom in it
Every rhythm have a beat in it
Every bulla every bun this seed got sweet in it
My fire got heat in it
Some man a meditate on deep in it

And the seed where you sow
You reap in it

Cup a bed and me sleep in it
