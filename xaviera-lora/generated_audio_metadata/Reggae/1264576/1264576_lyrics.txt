Mo' River, Mo' River
All right, yeah, yeah
Light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up yeah
All right
We smoke together
We loved the marijuana
We smoked the blasters
We drove the trees, smoked the laughter
Break it down, roll it up, keep some reefer in my blood
Lean is not up in my cup, I'm busy, I'ma pour one up
When I pass it, take a puff, don't ever disgrace the blunt
Inhale it and face the blunt, no flavor, you can taste the blunt
Got them going up like it's elevator music
Don't care'bout the money, I do it for the amusement
My weakness just turn to pepper, red, orange and blue shit
Cause I'm foggy, I can't even see where my crew in
We smoked in Canada, we loved them marijuana
We smoked in Las Vegas, we smoked the trees, smoked the ladder
We smoked in Canada, we loved them marijuana
We smoking Rasta
We flow the tree smoke a laughter
Look put your lighters up if you chief the ganja
We here to celebrate we don't want no drama
Respect your brother sister your mama and papa
American Reds by me feel like a Rasta
Get to the top like a Schwarzenegger movie
Higher than the sky, all the vocals on Bruce Lee
And they legalize it, so we can abuse it
So when I wake up, I'ma have to roll to split it
We smoke the ganja
We love the marijuana
We smoke the last last
We blow the tree, smoke the lighter
We smoke the ganja
We love the marijuana
We smoke the lobsters
We blow the trees, smoke the lobster
Do you wanna get high today
So high that you fly away, oh yeah
God forbid if I die today
I got the blood in my heart away, oh yeah
Do you wanna get high today
So high that you fly away, oh yeah
God forbid if I die today
I got the blood in my heart away, yeah
We smoke together
We love the marijuana
We smoke the elastos
We throw the trees, smoke the lighters
We smoke the ganja
We love the marijuana
The way she smoking last night
We know that trees smoke a lot
That trees smoke a lot
That trees smoke a lot
That trees smoke a lot
That trees smoke a lot
