She wore a short skirt (short skirt)
She had black and white shoes (black and white shoes)
When I looked at her (looked at her)
Cause I wanted to touch her hair
Anywhere
We knew from the start
We were meant to be apart
Red eye would be hurt
I wanted to touch her hair
We were riding in a Range Rover
We let go of your, pop your feet off the ground
Not making a sound
'Cause I wanted to touch your hair
Anywhere
We knew from the start
We were meant to be apart
When I looked in her
I wanted to touch your hair
We were riding in that Range Rover
Feel like we're a hundred feet off the ground
Not making a sound and don't have any voice
I wanted to touch your hair
