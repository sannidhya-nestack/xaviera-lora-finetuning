The sun shining bright every day
The water so clear, the breeze so sweet
We tell you this what can be beat
Montego Bay, Montego Bay

From the hills to the shore, everywhere we go
Montego Bay, that's where we flow
No problem, no worries, just good times

Montego Bay, Montego Bay
Where the vibes so irate when we stay
From the hills to the shore, everywhere we go
The Montego Bay, that's where we flow
So raise your hands and feel the groove
In Montego Bay, we're not alone
We love the unity, it's all around
In this town, happiness can be found
Montego Bay, Montego Bay
We're divine, so irate
Home we stay
From the hills to the shore
Everywhere we go
The Montego Bay
That's where we flow
Montego Bay
The place to be
In this tropical heaven

The same memories
The multi-robed, where the spirit is at its
