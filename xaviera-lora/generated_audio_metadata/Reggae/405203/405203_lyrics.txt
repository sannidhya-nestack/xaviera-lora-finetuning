Dooby dooby doo, doo doo
Dooby dooby doo, doo doo
You are the morning sun
That rises when the daylight comes
You are the moon and stars above
You only have to look at me
And I get lost in your mystery
I hear the music in your eyes
But wait a minute baby
I don't want to fall in love
Somebody better save me
This old heart has had enough
So take a little time with me
Then maybe we can wait and see if we can be
The romance of the year
Dooby dooby doo bop bop
Dooby dooby doo bop bop (oh oh oh oh oh)
Wah wah wah wah wah (oh oh oh oh oh)
Dooby dooby doo bop bop (dooby dooby doo bop bop)
Dooby dooby doo bop bop (oh oh oh oh oh)
Wah wah wah wah wah (oh oh oh oh oh)
But wait a minute, baby, I don't wanna fall in love
Somebody better save me, this old heart has had enough
Hey, oh baby, so take a little time with me
And maybe we can wait and see if we can be
The romance, yes, the romance of the year
Mmm-hmm, alright, yeah, come on
Year, oh, oh, of the year
Hey, hey, the romance of the year, of the year
Hey, hey, all the year
Ooh, baby, baby, yeah, the year
You and me, all the year
Hey, just you and me
