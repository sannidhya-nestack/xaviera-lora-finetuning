Why me a tell you say it's the place where me live, it's not so easy now
My youth is not just a place where you live, it's the old wild world
Trouble a take man from all side, man been stress and been distress
But let me tell you man, man been tore down but not been destroyed
This world is full of sorrows and pain, no one to ease up
The stress from we brain make we turn to father god the king will remain the same
Lead us inna the road that is narrow and plain
This world is full of sorrows and pain
No one to ease up the stress from we brain
Make we turn to father god the king will remain the same
Lead us inna the road that is narrow and plane
Frustration drive enough to crack and cocaine
Most of the youth dem go join the fast lane
My heart move with compassion when me see dem
People use them and abuse them well some go insane
Mommy say me never yet touch crack cocaine
Daddy say me worse me never do the same
Then how come the children them join this fast lane
Only bring down the family to shame and disgrace
This world is full of sorrows and pain
No one to ease up
This stress from we brain make we turn to father god the king will remain the same
Lead us inna the road that is narrow and plain
This world is full of sorrows and pain
No one to ease up this stress from we brain make we turn to father god the king will remain the same
Lead us inna the road that is narrow and
Well if you don't know how consult your bible
Cause me still believe say father god a real miracle
And me don't know say a good over evil
And a righteousness it's exactly people
Well people must be firm like the rock of Gibraltar
Go through trials don't be afraid to step to the altar
A God will heal your case and he will cure your cancer
To every question, Father God is the answer
This world, full of sorrows and pain
No one to ease up this slush from we brain
We turn to Father God, the king will remain the same
Lead us inna the road that is narrow and plain
This world, it full of sorrows and pain
No one to ease up
The stress from we brain, the twitter to father God the king will remain the same
Lead us inna the road that is the road of a certain argument
Men no say father God begs, they get up everyday only a teach about sex
A just a children brain, dem a perplexed
Sometime me a fi wonder what coming next
People no sit down and listen to them vice
Government who say most of them, them are real and thick rice
Some say them hot like fire, some of them cold like ice
But don't follow them and miss out paradise
This world full of sorrows and pain
No one to ease up the stress from we brain
Make we turn to father God the king will remain the same
Lead us inna the road that is narrow and plain
This world full of sorrows and pain
The system we bring make we turn to father God the king will remain the same
Lead us inna the road that is narrow and high
Frustration drive no to crack and cocaine
Most of the youth dem go time the fast lane
My heart move with compassion when me see dem inna the lane
People choose dem and abuse dem while some go insane
Daddy say me ne buy it
Touch, crack, cocaine
Mami say me worse, me never do the same
Then how come the children dem join this fast lane?
Bring down the family to shame and disgrace
This world is full of sorrows and pain, no one can change it

If we turn to father god the king will remain the same
Lead us inna the road that is narrow and plain
This world is full of sorrows and pain
No one to ease up the stress from we brain
If we turn to father god the king will remain the same
Lead us inna the road that is narrow and plain
