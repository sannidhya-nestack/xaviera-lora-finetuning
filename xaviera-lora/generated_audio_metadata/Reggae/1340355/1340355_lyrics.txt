Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah
The brave believe the only limit is the sky
Let your success be measured by how hard you try
The finish line can't be reached if you don't start
Close is close enough when giving all your heart
Losing doesn't always mean you didn't win
Keep moving forward toward each of life's horizons
Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah
No one ever reaches every mountain top
Don't give in to give it up
If you're tempted to stop
The higher you climb
The better the view
Discover for yourself what the hopeful say is true
Anything is possible under the sun
Keep moving forward toward each of life's horizon
Oh yeah
Always trying to find the end of the rainbow
The journey will take you to a place where dreamers go
Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah
A better tomorrow should be your goal for today
Tell yourself to hold on to the arms of faith
Anything is possible under the sun
Keep moving forward toward each of life's horizons
Oh yeah
You'll find heaven
When you reach beyond life's horizons
