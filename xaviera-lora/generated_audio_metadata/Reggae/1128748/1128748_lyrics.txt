You feel longing in the center of your soul
Need for belonging that the will cannot control
Open your eyes and see the light from up above, real love
You feel the power as it wraps around your heart (real love)
This is your hour of discovery it was there from the start (real love, real love)
The real love, real love
Real love
You felt the emptiness before when you were standing on your own
Now that you've opened up the door you will never be alone
Open your eyes and see the light from above, real love
You feel the magic as it penetrates your heart
Oh la la la la la la la la
Oh la la la la la la la la
We hear your love, hear your love
You got an answer when it's knocking at your heart
We hear your love, hear your love
Our discovery it was there from the start
We hear your love, hear your love
Open your heart now and you will begin to hear
Real love (real love)
You'll know the power now that you've begun to feel
Real love
