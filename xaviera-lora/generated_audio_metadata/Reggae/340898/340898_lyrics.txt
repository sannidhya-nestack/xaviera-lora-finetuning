Wrong then wrong then wrong we go
You and me, can you be my super lady
From the first day that we met
I will never ever et
No no baby when I looked into your eyes
I saw angels smiling with me
Oh baby
I asked if you can be my baby
You can be a super lady
Super lady
Round and round and round we go
You and me
Can't you be my super lady
Super super super lady
Can't you be my super lady
My super lady

Three long years have passed and gone
Here we are
Still love is strong, love is strong, oh baby
We've been grooving in a circle, circle of love
You and me, you and me baby
Friends have tried to tell you girl, you were not
Not the one for me
But it's only jealousy
Behind your back
They flirt with me
Trying to be
Where you are with me
But they don't rock crazy
They don't have what it takes to be
A super lady
Class and propriety
Are what you have, baby
Round and round and round we go
You and me
Can't you be my super lady
Super super super lady
Can't you be my super lady
Round and round, round we go
You and me
Can't you be my super lady
Super super super lady
Can't you be my super lady
