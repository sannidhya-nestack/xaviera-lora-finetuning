Heavenly Father, have mercy on them souls who appraise all kinds of false gods and false idols, but they should be praising only you
And those who a put them trust in a mankind a nah put them trust in a God
Gah me no see nobody else in this life me fear more than how me fear Christ
Nuff a dem a put them trust in a mankind a nah put them trust in a God
Gah me no see nobody else in this life me fear more than how me fear Christ
Nuff a dem a worship the devil just riches and gold but I'll never sell my soul
I'd rather live poor and dead poor before me me the devil take control
Nuff a dem a brag bout dem praise illuminati
But me no praise no one I God
Nuff a dem a bow down a worship took a one took a what but that's how me know dem mad
Lord have mercy (for those who are wishing for his angels)
Lord please have mercy (a mercy on them soul even the father)
Father ive me for all the wrongs that I done
And thank you for sending your son
Cause he came and he died so I could live life
I put my trust in God
Not for them I take life and them can't give it
Not for them know what's right and I live it
But father ive them don't forsake them
They should praise no other God but you
Have mercy upon them soul even my father
Lord please have mercy
I fear no one a god but you
Lord have mercy
That's right
Lord please have mercy
The supreme being
And those who a put them trust in a mankind a nah put them trust in a God
Cause we no see nobody else in this life me fear more than how me fear Christ
Nuff a dem a put them trust in a mankind a nah put them trust in a God
'Cause me no see nobody else in this life me fear
More than how me fear Christ
Nuff a dem a worship the devil just see riches and gold
But I'll never sell my soul
I rather live poor and die poor before me make the devil take control
Nuff a dem a brag bout dem place illuminati
But me no praise no one high god
Nuff a dem a bow down a worship to cow and to goat
But a that's how me know dem are the bad ones
Lord have mercy, Lord please have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord please have mercy
