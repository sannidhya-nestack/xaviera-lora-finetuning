I don't know why I've fallen for you
I don't know why I've fallen in love with you
I don't know why
I've fallen in love with you
And you
I must be crazy
To fall in love with you
Baby baby
You are another man's girl
What a crazy thing to do
Baby baby
I don't know why I'm falling for you
I don't know why I'm falling in love with you
I don't know why
I'm falling in love with you
And you
I was so disappointed
When you told me you already had someone
Baby baby I won't give up
I think someday I'll be the lucky one
Baby baby I don't know why I'm falling for you
I don't know why I'm falling in love with you
I don't know why
I'm falling in love with you and you
I can't resist your charm
You make me feel so warm
Baby baby
But will you be mine
That would make me feel so fine
Oh baby baby
I don't know why I'm falling for you
I don't know why I'm falling in love with you
I don't know why
I'm falling in love with you
And you
I don't know why I'm falling for you
I don't know why I'm falling in love with you
I don't know why
Don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
Don't know why, I don't know why
