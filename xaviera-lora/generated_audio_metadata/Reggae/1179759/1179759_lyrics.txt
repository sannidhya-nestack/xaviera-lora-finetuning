Rastafari lives
Lives within our hearts
Lives forevermore
Give praises to his name
Rastafari lives
Lives within our hearts
Lives forevermore
Give praises to his name
Praise Him every day, praise Him every night
Cause Jah will make me feel alright
Jah has made me strong
He sheltered me from storm
When I'm feeling down
I read a Psalm
Rastafari lives
Lives within our hearts
Lives forevermore
Give praises to his name
Rastafari lives
Lives within our hearts
Lives forevermore
Give praises to his name
Jah opens a door
When another is closed
He picks me up when I'm falling
I go down on my knees and pray
Ask Jah to guide me everyday
Jah has been so good to me

Lives forevermore
Give praises to his name
The king of kings and lord of lords
The conquering lion of Judah
He guides
And protect us all
From all the pestilence that surrounds us day by day
Wish Jah all things are possible
Rastafari lives, lives within our hearts, lives forevermore
Give praises to his name, Rastafari lives
Lives within our hearts
Lives forevermore
