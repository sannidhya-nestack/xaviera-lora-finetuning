Yes I, well I'm man I'm a lion and the 242 is my jungle scene
Crushable spot, yeah oh oh oh
Alongside the illest, yeah
I'm a lion in a jungle, say
I'm a lion in a jungle, yeah
I'm a lion in a jungle, oh oh
Fighting this war everyday
Fantastic eyes to dreadful lows
My skin's tough enough to take life blows
Guitar as my weapon
These words are my ammunition
And I'm armored with the dreads
That fall from atop my head (yeah oh)
With my fist held up high (yeah)
So higher than the sky (yeah)
I'm a lion in the jungle (I'm telling you)
Say
I'm a lion in the jungle (whoa oh)
Pop pops away (whoa oh)
I'm a lion in the jungle (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Fighting this war everyday
Nothing of the jungle is a lion indeed
Nothing of the jungle should be living in greed
I sing for the poor and those living in need
And those who are locked up in jail, please set free
The lion no bow, you have to bow to the lion
No wicked, no light, me throw me tough like iron
Me know dem a hypocrite, they still wanna shake my hand
But only the most high I can rely on
Me tell you about peace, but a war dem want
Tell you about earth, but cigar dem want
Tell you about earth, but a mars dem want
Tell dem how donkey but a chaos dem a want
Go and Rastaman a time now fi advance
Remember fi give the local youth dem a chance
Yeah Rastaman up on the charts
Yo, every Ethiopian African
I'm a lion in the jungle (yeah)
I'm a lion in the jungle (bop bop boi)
I'm a lion in the jungle (yeah)
Fighting is for everyday
Rastafari
Whilst lying in the jungle I'm a golla two for two
Keeper of the poor and protector of the true
Finding music for a vessel of rice don't get to use
Stand firm and tall know the future start with you
Judge this in high let him take control of you
The greater greater dreadlocks and the fighter for the true
Wish you peace tell a lie
So higher than the sky say
I'm a lion in love
I'm a lion in the jungle (yeah)
I'm a lion in the (lion in the jungle) (yeah)
Say I'm fighting, say
Fighting this war everyday (yeah) (yeah) (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Tell'em I'm a lion, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Lion in the jungle
Legs are rising, all his enemies be scattering
The death of all to hate and flee before it
Rastafari
Powers of the earth
Lions in the jungle seen
The illest and precious say so
