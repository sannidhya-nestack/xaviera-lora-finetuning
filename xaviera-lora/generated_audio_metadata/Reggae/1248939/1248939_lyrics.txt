Early morning sunshine bright, feel the breeze cool tonight
Work hard but my pocket's light, no chance to get rich inside
Island rhythm keeps me strong, singing my carefree song
Life ain't right but we get along
No chance to get rich, still belong
We dance all night, under stars so bright
Money tight but we feel alright
No chance to get rich in this fight
Sea waves crashing on the shore
Barefoot dreams we can't ignore
Simple life but we want more
No chance to get rich, that's for sure
Steel drums playing sweet melody
We're lost in dreams of what could be
Can't find the sun or the sea
No chance to get rich but when we feel free
We dance all night under stars so bright
Money tight but we feel alright
No chance to get rich in this fight
Steel drums playing sweet melodies
Lost in dreams of what could be
Can't buy the sun for the sea
No chance to get rich but we feel free
We dance all night under stars so bright
Money tight but we feel all right
No chance to get rich in this time
In this time, yeah, in this time
In this time, in this time
In this time, yeah, in this time
In this fire, in this fire
