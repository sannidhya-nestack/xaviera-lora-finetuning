Walked into my room, walked into my room
Laying my head in silence
Walked into my room, walked into my room
Laying my head in silence
What did I hear?
What did you see?
What in the world?
What a day
A trickle of frown
Sensitive clown
Too many things going down
It's never too late to change your mind
Never ever the same, toe in the line
Walked into my room, walked into my room
Laying my head in silence
Walked into my room, walked into my room
Laying my head in silence
A rhythm of rhyme, never changing time
Remember the nickel and dime
Show time, here's a game that's light
Last stifle, don't strive
Before you know it, it's curtain time
It's never too late to change your mind
You're never ever the same
So end the line
It's never too late to change your mind
Never ever the same, toeing the line
Walked into my room, walked into my room
Laying my head in silence
Walked into my room
I walked into my room
Ligging my head in silence
Walked into my room, walked into my room
Laying my head in silence, oh yeah
Walked into my room, walked into my room
To lay my head
