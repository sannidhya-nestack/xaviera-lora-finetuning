And the powers, remember that
I'm Mr. Daniel First, that little white stone rolling in Babylon
And the powers, remember that
Lord, do not touch it, do not touch it, little white stone
That little white stone that's rolling in Babylon
Do not touch it, do not touch it, little white stone
That little white stone will make you Magallan
That little white stone we make you lose all your home
That little white stone we make you lose all your throne
That little white stone we make you lose all your zone
And sell everything that you own
Well, sell you and kill you own pan the compound
And done every cent out of your bank account

Give me the sense in me, nah make me hold a meditation
Give me the sense in me, nah give a good vibration

Give me the sense in me, nah call me love you all day long
Help me and sing my song, me people, me
