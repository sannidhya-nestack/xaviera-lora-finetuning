From the lip gloss to my outfit

Hit em in the face with a deadly flow
Spin in the bass sharp like a razor blade

You don't want to see the black brother make money
You wish me coulda drop dead down there
You wish you coulda live in the life like me yeah

To take all my riches and my life from me
So go ahead and make my day, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bless, me moxie puttin' no stress

Oh yes, these black stars, the most deaf
You get a chance to live my life, better pick it like protests
Your bullets left, ships sailed, it failed
Capsize, I'm so fresh, stay wet and I'm blessed
Baptized, that's fine, I'm ballin' like the head on a monk
I dare devils to jump, make my day who on a rump
Do you feel lucky punk, hun chump, well do ya

He handsome, I hang out
But he handcuffed, so I hang up
He gone ham now and I'm mad wrong
He man down, I change up
The sad song, I took off
He hooked on, he look soft
I'm on one, I'm a slam dunk
I'm a touchdown, I'm a home run
The face is cute, the body is slim
Booty is fat from doing squats in the gym
Got guap I can spend, and popular friends
My tropical empire island hopping again
Eating lobster and shrimp, you hoes hating
Don't hate me, hate my location
Your hands is out, I ain't donating
Y'all stand around while I'm rotating
Have the globe waiting on my show dates
That I should do, you would if you could too
Through all the hood blues, misunderstood views
The weather man got good news, make my day
Keep on hating go ahead and make my day
You don't want to see the black brother make money
You wish me could a drop dead down there
You wish you could live in the life like me yeah
Keep on hating go ahead and make my day
There's nothing you can do and there is nothing you can say
To take all my riches and my life from me
So go ahead and make my day yeah yeah yeah yeah
