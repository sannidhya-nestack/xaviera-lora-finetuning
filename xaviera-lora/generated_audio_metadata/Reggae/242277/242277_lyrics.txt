Oh oh oh I felt so good when I woke up this morning
Yeah, oh, oh, oh'cause I felt good when I went to bed last night
And yeah, oh, oh, oh, how did you feel when you woke up this morning?
Baby girl, yeah, oh, oh, oh, how did you feel when you went to bed last night?
if you're with me then you're feeling alright
Just for one night, put all difference aside
Baby don't fight, I'ma do what you like
Baby all through the night we gonna do it more than twice girl
And again in the morning
And again in the morning
Oh what a delightful morning it is to share with you
It was nice
Now I know that sometimes I say and do as I like
I'm gonna do what I got to do (to do)
But the party is live and I'm high like a five
But I'm drunk driving home to you (to you)
Looking out for cops over my shoulder
I'm definitely not sober
But I'ma make it back to you
I always do
Without you I feel like a king
Feel me come alive
From the love that you bring
Oh how I try
But I'm over pursuing
I'm going out drinking
And I can never get it right girl
Except in the morning
And again in the morning
I love sex in the morning
Especially when it's with you
Feels nice, yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah
Love is such a funny thing, I know
I know, I know, I know
That love is such a funny thing for me
So don't bitch, girl, and don't trip
I didn't even find that chick attractive
Baby girl, you are mine
And you take up all of my time
Like every morning
And again in the morning
I love sex in the morning
When it's with you
It was nice
