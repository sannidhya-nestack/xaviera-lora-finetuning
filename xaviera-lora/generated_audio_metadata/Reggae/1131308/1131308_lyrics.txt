And it's good to know the world China first won, eh-eh
Peace and love is what we require
Everybody in the world join'em together
In an ideal world there'd be no war
Everybody has won, eh-eh
No threat to our lives, fear no more
With us moving along, eh-eh
In an ideal world there'd be no hate
Come sing my song, eh-eh
No reason for races to separate
Ali kablov everyone
And where there's darkness, the man won't fall
And where there's sunshine, we all stand tall
If we take the time to love one another
Realize that we're not alone
With sisters and brothers (There's a place for you and I)
In an ideal world
How'bout me say, hey!
God will shine on your face
Those who are wicked will perish from the place
Hey, hey!
God will shine on your face
And those who are good will live in grace
How'bout me say?
In an ideal world
There'd be no greed
Enough to go'round for those in need (Holly John Solutions)
In an ideal world there'd be no pain
Peace and love would rule again (Holly Broadway them)
And where there's darkness, man will fall
And where there's sunshine, we all stand tall
Everybody will be free in an ideal world
Everybody will be free in an ideal world
How will we say, you couldn't be worse?
If we take the time to love one another
Realize we're sisters and brothers
There's a place for you and I in an ideal world
And when we sing peace and harmony, and when we all are four, and when we walk in team, and when we say peace and harmony, and when we all are four and when we walk in team, and when we say white you could of black you could of pink or blue, hey
We stick together just like crazy go, all who are wicked I am talking
No hey,'cause they will come and they will pay ratios, yeah
Once you put a block, you put a pink on, no hey
Let's stick together just like crazy glow (in the night)
