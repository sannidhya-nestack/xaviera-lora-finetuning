Hey baby
Won't you come and take a chance
Feel the rhythm
And let's dance
Kick off your shoes
Feel the sand between your toes
Feel the rhythm
Just let go
Can you feel it?
Feel the rhythm and the sound
It's life in your veins
So don't you shut it down, oh
Hey baby
Won't you come and take a chance
Feel the rhythm
And let's dance, dance, dance
Move your body
Come on, swing it like the breeze
Feel the rhythm and just be, hey baby
Can you feel it?
Feel the rhythm and the sound
It's life in your veins
So stand up and get down
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey baby
Won't you come and take a chance?
Feel the rhythm
And let's dance, dance, dance
Hit the groove
Ride the cloud all across the sky
Let the music
Take you high
Into the morning
As you sway into the sun
Feel the rhythm
Just kick off your shoes and run
Feel the music
Come on baby take a chance
Feel the rhythm
And let's dance, dance, dance
Feel the rhythm
And let's dance
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Let's dance, dance, dance
Oh baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Feel the rhythm
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
