Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
I set the fire, it's scorching
Drop the top on that Porsche
Like Vanity White got the real tonight
Cause I'm bout to make me a fortune
I chose to do good life
Got goals from my hood life
Oh yes, we made it past yesterday
When I kissed the baby goodnight
Niggas throw they flag like the official
I go back to popping that pistol
They fear me now
Y'all hear me, I see clearly now
Crystal, as you try to see what this clip through
My magazine it got
It's you, it's your career, enjoy your body
Your whole squad can die with you
Ain't no party like this one, ain't no party me bid

Cause I goes hard in this bitch
Live like there is no tomorrow
God damn it I hope that she swallow
Come get your grams or so Instagram

Just so I can pass the time
Don't make me have to blast a nine cause I will
Does what the fuck I feel
All summer bitch I'm something sick
Cut my own slinky high heels

They silicone I'm real
The shit I'm on is like filthy porn when I get it on I'm ill
Did some foul shit to get by
Eating worse than that to get high
