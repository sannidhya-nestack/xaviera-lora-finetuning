I put my shoes on
Just to go see what the mailman had left for me
There was a phone bill and a light bill
And sandwiched in between the Billboard magazine
There was a letter I read and I scratched my head
it said, let me tell y'all what it said
It said, "Dear songwriter"
We love your music, and we're crazy about your rhymes
But unfortunately, it just ain't what we need at this time
Songwriter, songwriter
I didn't get discouraged, huh? Let me tell you what I did next now
I sit down at my piano
And I decided to give it another try
Recorded me some demos on production bay
And I missed'em down real good
It was almost Hollywood
Now I'm awaiting my reply
Time goes creepin' by and I wonder why
My reply I always say it's a dear songwriter
We love your music and we're crazy about your rhymes
But unfortunately it just ain't what we need at this time
Songwriter, songwriter (I kept my head up though)
Songwriter
I've been trying really hard
I don't know what's the deal
Maybe I shouldn't send
Reggae music to Nashville
they say, "Dear songwriter
We love your music
And we're crazy about your rhymes
But unfortunately
It just ain't what we need at this time
Songwriter, songwriter, songwriter
I guess I better get back, back, back to the old drum and board
Gonna try to write some more
Songwriter, Songwriter, Songwriter, Songwriter, Songwriter, Songwriter, Songwriter, Songwriter, Songwriter, Songwriter, Songwriter, Songwriter
