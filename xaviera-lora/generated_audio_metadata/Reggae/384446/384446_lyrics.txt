For every little choice you decide to make
And all the decisions and paths that you take
They determine the future you can't mess it up
You'll be stuck in a hole without a fuck
Go, go, go, go! No aspirations, no celebration
Low determination, rarely with the patience
Go, go, go, go! No aspirations only hesitation
Low determination, rarely with the patience
What's the next step in this single violin?
Will I do the same? Does he diagnose mine?
What's the next step in this single violin?
Will I do the same? Does he diagnose mine
You end up like the rest, not doing it for yourself
Follow the tracks
Only minor setbacks
You end up like the rest not doing it for yourself
Follow the tracks
Only minor only minor setbacks
No aspirations only celebration
Low determination rarely without patience
No aspirations only hesitation
Low determination rarely without patience
What's the next step in this single file line
Will I do the same cause me dad knows fine
What's the next step in this single file line
Will I do the same cause me dad knows fine
What's the next step in this single file line?
We'll all do the same'cause we diagnose fine
What's the next step in this single file line
We'll all do the same'cause we diagnose fine
