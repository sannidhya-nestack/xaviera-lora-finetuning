I've got 88 women in my head
They're all singing play Russian roulette
One of us is bound to wind up dead
One last lady singing in my head
She was the only one who understood me best
I miss her most when I'm lying in my bed
I close my eyes, I see her in my head
I try to et, you know I can't and that's it
They're all singing play Russian roulette
One of us is bound to wind up dead
One last lady singing in my head
She was the funny one not sure where she went
Left us by surprise
No we won't et, oh
We loved her laugh
The way she wore her hair
The way she jumped right in
Without a care
I've got 86 women in my head
It's better to leave it even, that's what she said
We could line them up and put them all to rest
Two birds, one stone, or whatever she said
I laid them down and took them right in
Kissed'em on the cheek
Six feet under should do the trick
Now when I close my eyes I'm all by myself
Me, myself and I, nobody else
One finger on the trigger just in case
One of those ladies comes back to say
I'll take her down whatever it takes
Got away the odds
What are the stakes
I had 88 women in my head
