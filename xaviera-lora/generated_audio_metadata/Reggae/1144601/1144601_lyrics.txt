I will do everything I need to do to keep you
I swear to God I will do everything
I'll never let you go again
I love you with all my heart
I'll be your angel
Watch over you, yeah
I'll be your
Angel, watch over us all
Looking at you through the glass
You got those orange stripes all over you
It's sad but true, yeah
You're on a sudden kind of ride
Coming back to the good side
I'll take your hand, let's do it right
When I look at you, I cry
When you look at me, I divide
All the times you've taken to convince you
To come back home again
Your precious kind of guy
Your soul is so on fire
Just like mine
Just like mine
I'll be your wife
Angel, watch over you, yeah, I'll be her
Angel, watch over her too
Coffee by myself, you used to make it so perfectly sweet, yeah
Tender touch is all I need, looking into her eyes
I can tell she's cried so many times
But we can see it with our sight, our faith is so blind
Our destiny's completed, there's a certain kind of shine
You'll get what you find, you're on mainland
I'll be your angel
Watch over you, yeah
I'll be yours
Angel, watch over her too
Yeah, I'll be your angel, watch over you
I'll be your heart, I'll be your angel too
Watch over the both of you
