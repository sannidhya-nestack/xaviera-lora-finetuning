Ooh yeah
I'm on the rebound (rebound, rebound)
Catch me if you can
I'm on the rebound (rebound, rebound, rebound)
I'm a very troubled man
I'm on the rebound (rebound, rebound),
So catch me if you can
Hey there girl
I know you've been wanting me, but girl
My head's not in the right place, you see
We could be together
But it wouldn't be quite right, my fools
Wouldn't be with you tonight
I'm on the rebound (rebound, rebound)
Catch me if you can
I'm on the rebound (rebound, rebound, rebound)
I'm a very troubled man
I'm on the rebound (rebound, rebound, rebound)
So catch me if you can
My heart doesn't know
What to do right now
It's confused
Or messed up somehow
Baby it's time
To stop loving me so
Baby it's time
For you, letting go
I'm on the rebound (rebound, rebound)
Catch me if you can
I'm on the rebound (rebound, rebound),
I'm a very troubled man
I'm on the rebound (rebound, rebound,)
So catch me if you can
There's a wall
So high you can't get to me
Standing tall
My heart's protected you see
Hey there girl
Don't climb it there's no need you see
Don't look over
Your future's not with me
I'm on the rebound (rebound, rebound)
Round and round on the rebound
Round and round on the rebound
Round and round on the rebound (rebound)
I'm on the rebound (rebound, rebound)
I'm a troubled man on the rebound
Go around and around
I'm on the rebound (rebound, rebound)
I'm a troubled man on the rebound
Yes I am, I'm a troubled man, on the rebound
I'm a troubled man, I'm a troubled man, I'm on the rebound
I'm a troubled man, on the rebound, going round and round
I'm on the rebound, I'm a troubled man, on the rebound
Trouble man on the rebound
Trouble man on the rebound
Going round and round on the rebound
I'm a trouble man yes I am
