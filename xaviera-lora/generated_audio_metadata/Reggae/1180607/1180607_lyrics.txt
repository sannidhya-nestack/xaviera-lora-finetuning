You always around when I'm feeling down
You never leave me to face my blues alone
You light the stars and you're shining so bright
Girl you always make me feel alright
You're like sugar
You're like spice
You're everything so nice
You light up my life
You're so good to me
You're like sugar
You're like spice
You're everything so nice
You light up my life
You're so good to me
Girl you give me true love and devotion
Your tender care fills me with satisfaction
You mean to me much more than words can say
You are my queen
You're nice in every way
You're like sugar
You're like spice
You're everything so nice
You light up my life
You're so good to me
You're like sugar
You're like spice
You're everything so nice
You light up my life
You're so good to me
Sugar, sugar, sugar
You thrill my soul
You fill my heart with gladness
You turn my blues to joy and happiness
With you around and feeling so secure
You're always here to comfort me for sure
You're like sugar, you're like spice
You're everything so nice, you light up my life
You're so good to me
You're like sugar
You're like spice
You're everything so nice
You light up my life
You're so good to me
You're like sugar
You're like spice
You're everything so nice
You light up my life
You're so good to me
You're like sugar
You're like spice (so nice)
You're everything so nice (so nice)
You light up my life
