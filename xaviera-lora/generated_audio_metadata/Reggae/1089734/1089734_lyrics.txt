Fulfill we needs and all of we wants from the other day
I notice there's something going on in our life
Don't take your friend dem foolish advice, you know
Say love will fulfill we needs and all of we wants
Do earth love and say you're not, hey
Love will fulfill we needs and all of we wants
Do earth love and say you're not
Remember the first time we met it was love we possessed
The one bed we have we share it with each other
And the roof over we had shelter from stormy weather
Me notice somewhere there it seems like something wrong
What's up what the matter tell me what a go on
Go make me sit down with me and them a me Jah
Can't take the lay lay nor the bag a long long
Explain to me because I can understand
Say love will fulfill we needs and all of we wants

Don't fool yourself'cause you're the apple of my eyes
When God create you and give to me a special price
Good one doesn't great duty I be hold before my sight
