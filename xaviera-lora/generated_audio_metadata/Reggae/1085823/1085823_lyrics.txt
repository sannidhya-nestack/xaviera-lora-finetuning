He's no ordinary man, no he's no ordinary man
Run come see this man, mmm man
Run come, run come see a man, you know who won't he
Run come, he's no ordinary man, lord I wish you must
Run come
Run come see a man
There's one thing I know
Nothing is impossible
You name it he can
Whoa
Every time you talk about this man
Somebody get offended
Some say he's just a creature
Some say he's just an old proxy
Whoa but if you know this man or have a relationship
Sooner or later you'll find out
That they are talking foolishness
Oh you must run from
Run come see your man
You know who all he is
Run from
He's a serious man
You and you and you should run from
Run come see a man
There's one thing I know
Nothing is impossible
You name it he can
Oh oh oh
One day he went by the temple
And saw some people yambling
Immediately he got angry and asked, "What you all think you doing?"
So he went over in the corner and tied a piece of rope
Man he ripped, he kicked, he caught on that blade
Everything he overthrew
Man you must run come, run come see your man
No more here, run come
He's the ordinary man
Lord, I wish you would
Run, Tom
For lord have mercy
Run, come see your man
There's one thing I know
Nothing is impossible
Do the imitation
Tell him to come out this man
Imitate him
I'm an atheist, I don't want to talk
He's a demon, I'll run him inside, boy
Nothing is impossible, my lord
Run, come see your man
I tell you it make me
Blind man a see and the dumb man a door
The deaf man a hear and the lame start war
Nothing is impossible with my lord
Run come see your man
(Mmm you must)
Run come
Run come see your man
(Ding dong omoi)
Run come
He's no ordinary man
(Oh I wish you would)
Run come
Run come see a man
There's one thing I know
Nothing is impossible
You name it he can
Let me tell you little about this man
I tell you this man is my hero
This man is my king
This man is the great wind beneath my wing
I know I owe my whole life to him and so
This is the reason why I man sing
The blind man must be led, the hungry must be fed
All sick man himself he get out of bed
Him took two fishes and five loaves of bread
And that day about five thousand souls he fed
You must run come, run come see a man
Sing of the war he run come
He's no ordinary man
You and you and you should run from
A lot of mercy, run and come see your man
There's one thing I know
Nothing is impossible, you may make it happen
Listen, one day he met this young lady
Down at the well
And all about this lady's life, strangely he could tell
He says, "Miss, you are a prostitute and that man you got ain't your man"
Immediately when she heard this
Down to her city she ran
She said run come people me say run come quick
All my life I have never seen a man like this
Who could tell me bout my life from start to finish
Run come people witness run come see a man
Run come see a man
I wish you would run come
Run come see a man
No way
Run come
He's no ordinary man
Lord I wish you would run from
Oh Lord have mercy, run from fear man
There's one thing's final
Nothing is impossible, you name it he done
Tell me what's his name? Jesus
What is his name? Jesus
I dare hear that name? Jesus
I wish you'd shout that name? Jesus
