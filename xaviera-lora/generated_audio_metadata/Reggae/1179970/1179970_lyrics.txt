Just a little bit closer baby
Let me feel your body next to mine

Come give me loving now don't keep me waiting
I'm hot blooded ready for your loving

You turn me on and I'm so excited
Some first class loving you always give to me

Cause I'm hot loaded ready for your loving
Come give me loving now don't keep me waiting
I'm hot loaded ready for your loving
Come give me loving now don't keep me waiting
