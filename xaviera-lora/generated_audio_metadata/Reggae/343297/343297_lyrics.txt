So many people running
So many people alone
So many people suffering
And the world don't want to know (know)
Woah, please make it stop
Woah, woah
So many traditions crumbling
Yeah, making us all feel so small
And so many changes coming
I can't keep track of them all
No, no, no, woah, woah
Please make it stop, woah, woah
Oh look what we're going through, yeah
What happened to our old ways
Oh what's a man to do, oh yeah
And what good to complain
So many people struggling (struggle now)
Trying to put food on the shelf (so hard)
So many beliefs tumbling (why should we fall down)
And we don't even believe in ourselves
No no no
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Please make it stop
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Please make it stop
