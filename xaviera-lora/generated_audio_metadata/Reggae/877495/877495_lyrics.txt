Everything is so damn strange I can't stop thinking about you
The way you looked at me I cannot et
I don't even know your name but I must find you
Your beauty amazed me so I want to know something more
I was singing on the stage while you was watching me
And then this lady stole my soul that I want to see
I've been searching in all the ways to finally find you
And now I still can't believe this is true
You and I
It's something more I can't deny
I feel so free
When you are so close to me
It's a destiny
Oh have you put a spell on me
I can't believe
I think I'm in love with you
Now you're in my life and you broke the fresh feelings
I almost ot that something so good exists
I'm trying really hard to find your bad habits
But for the first time there's nothing I want to change
The more I am involved with you
The more it's strange to me
Changing the principles of my life philosophy
You took the part
So take the rest
I want you in my future
Please never become my past
You and I
It's something more I can't deny
I feel so free
When you are so close to me
Is it destiny
Or have you put a spell on me
I can't believe
I think I'm in love with you
You and I
It's something more I can't deny
I feel so free
When you are so close to me
Is it destiny
Or have you put a spell on me
I can't believe
I don't think I'm in love with you
