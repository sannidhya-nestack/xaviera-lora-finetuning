An eye for an eye
Hey
Eye and eye and eye say the bible don't lie
Say eye
Eye for an eye and eye for an eye
For an eye
Eye and eye say the bible don't lie
Say aye
Aye for an aye for an aye for an aye
Aye for an aye for an aye for an aye
Ha! Aye for an aye
On the island the children they played
It was a sunny day, a sunny day
The people thought it was a safe zone
But from that island sixty nine children never came home
Killed by a vile monster in a shirt and tie
They deserved to live, they didn't deserve to die
He was a monster, devoid of any emotion
He'd already killed eight more in a car explosion
Oh, hey, hey, monster
I and I say in the Bible don't lie, say aye
Aye for an aye, aye for an aye, aye for an aye for an aye
I and I say in the Bible don't lie say aye
Aye for an aye for an aye for an aye for an aye for an aye
Huh, an aye for an aye
An eye for an eye
An eye for an eye
Hey!
An eye for an eye
Said he believed in nationalism
Was against his country's liberalism
He wanted to change it all with a gun
He is yet another of Satan's many sons
Yet another of Satan's many sons
He stood in court like an actor on stage
Protected by a bulletproof glass cage
His lack of respect and arrogance was plain to see
He did not feel anything for the children's families
Eye for an eye for an eye for an eye for an eye
Eye for an eye for an eye for an eye for an eye
22 years is all he got
For what he did he deserved to rot
Three and a half months for each of the 77 lives he took
He will make millions when he writes a book
He lives in a hotel behind bars
To a few sickos he's the shining star
He doesn't care he snuffed out all those children's lies
All he moans about are the breaches of his human rights
I don't know his name
He's just the killer of 77
Lord
May you burn in hell
You won't go to heaven
I say the bible don't lie
Say I
Eye for an eye, eye for an eye, eye for an eye
Eye and eyes in the Bible of life
