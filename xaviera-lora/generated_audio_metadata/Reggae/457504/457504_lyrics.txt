Did we have the best time ever?
Traveling around with no destination
Life was not easy but we've managed
Thanks to the Almighty's kindness and protection
And now that we ot all the hardships
Which made us who we are
All those cold nights, hunger and pain
Couldn't do us any harm
Now that we ot all the hardship
And there are wrinkles on our faces
We let those gypsies wreck and die
We'll never et those sacred places
We'll never et those sacred places
Didn't we have the best time ever
Looking out for our secrets from this land
Life has a way of making beautiful
All of it is coming to the end
Now that we ot all the hardships
Which actually may last all we are
All those cold nights, hunger and rain
Didn't do us any harm
Now that we ot all the hardships
And there are wrinkles on our faces
We were those gypsies back in time
We'll never et those sacred places
We'll never et those sacred places
And how many times we've got to the wrong lane
Broke to pieces losing everything
But we've got back on our feet again
Never threw the double in the ring
Now that we ot all the hardship
Which actually made us who we are
All those cold nights, hunger and pain
Couldn't do us any harm
Now that we ot all the hardship
And our wrinkles on our faces
We let those gypsies back in time
We'll never et those sacred places
We'll never et those sacred places
We'll never et those sacred places
