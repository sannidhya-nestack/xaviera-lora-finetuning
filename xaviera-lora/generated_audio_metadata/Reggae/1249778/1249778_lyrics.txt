In the morning sun we rise
Feel the vibes, yeah, feel alive
But the news is all the same
Don't wanna hear that guy's name
Social media fills my mind
With his tweets time after time
Gotta take a deep breath in
I'm just tuning out the doom
No more Elon, no more noise
Gonna find my island choice
Leave the chaos far behind
Peace in the trees is what I find
On the beach with rum and lime
Every moment feels so fine
All the stress just fades away
As the waves come out to play
et the jets and spaceship dreams
Here and now in island seas
We don't need his tech facade
Just the earth beneath our feet so broad
No more Elon, no more noise
Gonna find my island choice
Leave the chaos far behind
Peace in the trees is what I find
