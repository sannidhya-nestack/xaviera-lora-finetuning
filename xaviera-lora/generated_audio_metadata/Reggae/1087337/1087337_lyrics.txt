I wish this world have love like it meant to be
I don't think you'll have to live in fear
Put some love inna your heart today
Don't walk away from God today (and if you're here)
God's voice don't hurt no heart today
And go put away those evil old stars today
Put some love inna your heart today
Don't walk away from God today (and if you're here)
God's voice don't hurt no heart today
And go put away those evil old stars today
Up inna the council of the ungodly
God dem speak great word against the almighty
The wicked rise up thinking can change time and law
Inna the poor and the needy ready fi sink in class
Build a room for the shelterless
And give a little love to the unfortunate
With this genuine type of loving ya we don't have to fret
And this type of loving you will never et
Put some love inna your heart today
Don't walk away from God today
God by son on your heart today
And go put away those evil old stars today
Put some love inna your heart today
Don't walk away from God today (and if you hear)
God by son on your heart today
And go put away those evil old stars today
Them say one love and a shed blood
That couldn't be love, love is a blessing from above
No, no love but dem no show love
Dem no believe in a God, dem envy and grudge
When you see your brother you must greet him with love
And when you see your sister you must greet her with love
Love is the greatest thing inna this world
So stop acting like you don't know love
And put some love inna your heart today
Don't walk away from God today
God voice on your heart today
And go put away those evil love stars today
Put some love inna your heart today
Don't walk away from God today
If you hear a God voice on your heart today
And go put away those evil love stars today
I wish peace and love and unity
For everyone in dem community
And I wish everyone love their family
I do the same for you, you do the same for me
Love in this world, joy and harmony
My dream to become reality
I pray for you, you pray for me
What a wonderful place this will be
Put some love inna your heart today
Don't walk away from God today (and if you hear)
God's voice don't hurt your heart today
And go put away those evil star today
Put some love inna your heart today
Don't walk away from God today
But your God fight us hard in your heart today
And go put away those evil love stars today
Push it up inna the council of the ungodly
Cause them speak great word against the almighty
The wicked rise up thinking can change time and law
Inna the poor and the needy ready fi sink in class
But build up a roof for the shelterless
And give a little love to the unfortunate
This genuine type of loving we will never regret
And this type of loving we will never et
Put a little love inna your heart today
Don't walk away from God today
If you hear God's voice on your heart today
And go put away those evil lusts that you carry
Put some love inna your heart today
Don't walk away from God today
If you hear God's voice on your heart today
And go put away those evil lusts that you carry
