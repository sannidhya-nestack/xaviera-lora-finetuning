Out comes the sun, in goes the rain
Sunshine with us once again
Just like the tide moves and it rides
Nature slips and it slides
When life has lost its shine and you're troubled in your mind
Reach out, answers we can find
When nothing goes your way and you need those words today
Be strong, beside you I will stay
Out comes the sun, in goes the rain
Sunshine with us once again
Just like the tide moves and it rides
Nature slips and it slides
And I, I, I, I, I, I ,I, I, I, I, I, I
And I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
When life has lost its shine
And you're troubled in your mind
Reach out, answers we can find
When nothing goes your way
And you need those words today
Be strong, beside you I will stay
Out comes the sun, in goes the rain
Sunshine
With us once again
With no one to hold me, oh-oh-oh
With no one to hold me, oh-oh-oh
With no one to hold me, oh-oh-oh
Without love
