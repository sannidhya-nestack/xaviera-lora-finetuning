We're born with both evil and good inside
Goodness will show but the other will hide
We'll hide until you sexually awaken
Like Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, yeah
The devil will make you do things you don't wanna do
He will twist your mind so you don't know what's right or true
If you worship money then you'll pay the price
Your soul will be offered as a sacrifice
If you dance with the devil
Then you do so at your peril
If you dance with the devil
Then you do so at your peril
Then you do so at your peril
He shot John in the colon
As he read the catcher in the rye
He shot Martin and Lorraine
He's happy when the good they die
So many killed to satisfy his lust for blood
The only thing that can stop him
Is the brotherhood of love
To protect your thoughts and your desires
'Cause the devil, he feed on fire
You got to protect your thoughts and your desire
the devil, he feed on fire
Sweet the devil, then you do so at your peril
Mmm, if you dance with the devil (yeah)
Ha, then you do so at your peril (yeah)
Then you do so at your peril
Some may ask if there's hope for mankind
I see judges judge evil crimes
As pity is shown for him in the dark
But the suffering of the victim is ot, is ot, is ot, is ot
But the suffering of the victim is ot
Try to do good through trouble and strife
Don't let the devil into your life
If you see him coming around
You gotta kick the devil right out of town
Hey, you gotta kick the devil right out of town
You gotta kick the devil right out of town
You gotta kick the devil right out of town
You gotta kick the devil right out of town
For if you dance with the devil
Then you do so at your peril
If you dance with the devil
Then you do so at your peril
Then you do so at your peril
If you dance with the devil
Then you do so at your peril
If you dance with the devil
Then you do so at your peril
Then you do so at your peril
Dance with the devil
Tell me
Then you do so at your peril
For if you dance with the devil
Then you do so at your peril
One more time
If you dance with the devil
Then you do so at your peril
Then you do so at your peril
Then you do so at your peril
Then you do so at your peril
Then you do so at your peril
