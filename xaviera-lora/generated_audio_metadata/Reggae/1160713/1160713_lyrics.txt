Catalina, been so long since I seen ya
Catalina, been so long since I seen ya
Your sun-soaked beaches and moonlight bays
Where lovers tell tales, make you want to stay
Catalina
Been so long since I've seen ya
Tell me how you been
I see you in my dreams
Where candy colored sunsets
And the days end, yo
Tide and morning skies
Just leave me amazed
Catalina, it's been long since I've seen you
I want to ride your heels, sail on your wings
Lean from your fountain, be in your arms
The more I remember, I'm good to admit
That sound of your name, how could I ever et
Oh, Catalina!
It's been so long since I've seen the Azab
Say I'm crazy but I don't care
They wouldn't know if they've never been there
Somehow someday I'll find my way back to where it all began
Oh Catalina
It's been so long since I've seen you
Catalina
It's been so long since I've seen you
Catalina
It's been so long since I've seen you
Catalina
It's been so long since I've seen you
Catalina
