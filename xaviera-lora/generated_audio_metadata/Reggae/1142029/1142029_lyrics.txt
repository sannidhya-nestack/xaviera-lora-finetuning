And we don't make nobody worry
After we done did it
Nobody can't come brush our brain, you know, at a time
Make them go that same speed, indeed
And we don't make nobody worry, why?
And we don't make nobody brush off the way brain got a skin
We make them sick away
And we a drink champagne a fly inna we own plane
Now me nobody worry why
And we no me nobody brush off the way brain not a strain
We make them sick away
And we a drink champagne a fly inna we own plane
Yo!
We dem a sleep and we suffer true dem no recognise
We dem used to laugh off and dem trust and realise
Waki dem a spread and a watch you like a set of spies
Move to the top where girl dem sit true dem a exercise
Look how dem witty and dem pretty like butterflies
Eyes a dazzle when dem see wey dem get hypnotized
Dem never know we would a play the fool fi catch the wise
Aya we a reach cause we don't have the bonanza prize
Dem no worry wey
A we no make nobody brush off the way brain that a strayed
We make dem sick a way
A we a drink champagne a fly in a we own plane
We no make nobody puzzle wey
A we no men have a depression till we brain not a screen
We make them sick away
A we a drink champagne a fly in a we own plane
When me and a girl a used to dey made it a baffle
She left me young and gone with one bag of snuckle
Juggle me a juggle with ten bag of buckle
Now me bust out a deep and left a buckle in Morocco
Step up inna life and pop off all shackles
Dry bread me use to eat but now money on yam waffle
She want rally back but me left her the hassle
Cross this girl me not angle and jostle
Vanity girl fi get the fowl down fuzzle
Fi wiggle dem offi sweet and pretty like a apple
Have dem inna growth, nuff, nuff till we a ruffle
Dem a want fi tackle, take dem to the chapel
We no me nobody worry way
A we no me nobody pressure fi we brain not a skin
We make them sick away
And we a drink champagne a fly inna we own plane
We no make nobody puzzle way
And we no make nobody pressure fi we bring not a strain
We make them sick away
And we a drink champagne a fly inna we own plane
Yo, we love fi see di girl dem just up and look slick
Bass line a wine when boom read dem kick
Dem rise all me tempo irritate me stick
Me man a each on pon your body like 6 6 2 6
We love fi see de girl dem wid dem skin look smooth
A dance de gorilla beat erotic and nude
Dem make we feel nice any time dem go and rude
A wine pon de ready make straight head and nude
Dem no worry wei
A we no men a body pressure fi we brain not a strain
We make dem sick a wei
And we a drink champagne a fly inna we own plane
And we no make nobody puzzle way
And we no make nobody pressure fi we brain that a strain
We make them sick away
And we a drink champagne a fly inna we own plane
Yo, we dem a sleep and we suffer true dem no recognise
We dem used to laugh off and dem just a realise
Wacky dem a spread and dem a watch we like a set of spies
We put it up we got dem fit true dem a exercise
Eyes a dazzle when dem see we dem get hypnotised
Look how dem pretty and dem pretty like butterflies
