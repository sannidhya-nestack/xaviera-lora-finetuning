But I'm not tellin'em I'm not a regular dude
Three months
Me check my nursery rhyme
Children, children, I wonder if they'll listen
Children, children, I wonder if they'll listen
Say once upon a time, say the monkey was a swine
Children, children, I wanna tell you say
Wherever you go, you gotta be like Mojo
So me see you like a sugar gum, keep on dancing
We wait, we wait, we wait, we wait
We wait, we wait, we wait, we wait, we wait
Say once upon a time, we wait, we wait, we wait,
We check no nursery rhyme, we wait, we wait, we wait,
Children, children I wanna tell you say
We wait, we wait, we wait, we wait, we wait
We must break it up
We must don't see it
Children, children I wanna tell you say
Bring more, bring more
Milchat no nursery rhyme
Say what's up on the time, say the monkey was a slime
Children, children, I wanna tell you stay
Hear me noise and rock it all day
Tell me sweet like a sugar gum and keep on dance
Lord I got me gonna tell them right now
Lord I got me gonna tell them right now
Children, children, I wanna tell you stay
Hear me now say me rock it all day
Me chat my nursery rhyme
Me keep on coming down on a rock on your shoe
Say me sweet like a sugar come and keep on dancing
Run to a tree, run to a tree, I wanna be free, free like a bird in a tree
Say once upon a time, say the monkey was a swine
We waiting, we waiting, we, we, we, we
We waiting, we waiting, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, children children I want to tell you say
Dream on
Dream on
Say once upon a time say that monkey was a swine
Children children I wonder tell you say
Dream on
Children children I wonder tell you say
We, we, we, we, we, we, we-we-we, we-we-we, we-we, we-we-we, we, we, we, we, we
