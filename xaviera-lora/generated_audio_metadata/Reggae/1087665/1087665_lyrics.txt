I just can't take this lonely life no more me a wonder, is because I am poor
Is not good for a girl to be alone me a wonder, is because she are poor
I just cannot take this lonely life no more, me a wonder
It's because I am poor
It's not good for a man to be alone, me a wonder
It's because I am poor
I quote in this verse when we going to college
It seems like she believe we no have enough knowledge
She loved the guy with the black Ferrari
She fell in love with a soldier in the army
Friend dem a say me mustn't worry too much
I soon get a girl of my own
I don't believe my friend dem is sure
I want a girl with a lot of knowledge
And inna her brilliance if we have dignity
So we can walk hand in hand and help each other
I will treat her like how me treat me mother
And if it is possible me treat her better
Come in for work and open my door
On me carpet alone, me sip on me floor
And inna my room only my pillow and my bed
It seems like me and me pillow and door
Can't take this lonely life no more
Me a wonder, is because I am poor
It's not good for a girl to be alone, me andah
It's because she are poor
I can't take this lonely life no more, me andah
It's because I am poor
It's not good for a man to be alone, me andah
It's because I am poor
I bring her some chocolate and some ice cream
To my surprise she could not be found
I bring her a pet and a bunch of roses
To my surprise she were not around
It seems like she gone just to look some dollars
Either she gone just to be a gold digger
To my surprise that was a friend dem she a follower
Now she reveal her true colour
I was thinking about her better
Give her a better life and a
Better future
She could have bring my sons and my daughter
Both of us together would have make things better fast
I cannot take this lonely life no more me a wonder
It's because I am poor
It's not good for a girl to be alone me a wonder
It's because she are poor
I cannot take this lonely life no more me a wonder
It's because I am poor
It's not good for a man to be alone me a wonder
It's because I am poor
If I was a boy I would treat her like a girl
If I was a man I would treat her like a woman
If I was a prince I would treat her like a princess
If I was an emperor I would treat her like an empress
But I am a king so I have to treat her like a queen
Nothing in this world can not come between
Hiding and living in my wireless dream
If I am a dream I am not alone
I'm tired to text her on my telephone
Tired to email on my laptop
Right now me want this thing ya fi stop somebody help me because me must make a choice
I cannot take this lonely life no more me a wonder
It's because I am poor
It's not good for a girl to be alone me a wonder
It's because she are poor
I cannot take this lonely life no more me a wonder
It's because I am poor
