He chopped them off, not to feel ashamed.
A fallen angel walks among us
But in his mind the concept is still divine
What he sees he tries to deny
But it's hard to fight off the vice
In his eyes you can see he feels sad
Because his eyes have witnessed a lot of bad
A mother killing her son
A boy robbing and raping and killing just for fun
A friend stabbing a friend in the back
A brother telling lies about his sibling and their mom
The mean father molesting his youngs
The corrupted politician grabbing all he can grab
A boy robbing and raping and killing just for fun
What he sees he tries to deny
A twisted priest looking for some fun
In a distracted girls looking for some guidance
Us, people doing drugs without knowing why or what
They're about to enter a competition they cannot withstand
Institutions collapse, relationships fall apart
Lovers who cry in the dark
Elder people feeling bad when looking back
Everyone is looking for some more cash or is it plastic now
Little kids die of starvation while I drive a car of admiration
And now his wings are a disgrace
He chops them off not to feel ashamed
But he does.
