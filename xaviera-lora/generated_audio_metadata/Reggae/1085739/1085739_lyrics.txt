A Jah create everything (earth and all) give thanks and praise man, ready to be praised (blessed inna)
So all nation if you black or white, give thanks every morning and wake up the cloward

And them a curse up the earth and a church be a fort

And now dem want choke out man heart

And a tell me say dem hard, tough like a butter
Talk bout dem slippy dem a go slide down the gutter
When Rasta man a utter, me a sing bout la power of thought

Jump out a parachute, who me fi jump with him?
