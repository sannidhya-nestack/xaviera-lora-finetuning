Okay, all them say Christian can't dance
All the Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Ghost
You don't know that
One, two, three
In a loser time you have a prayer
Ask almighty Jesus Christ to show you the way
Guide and protect you each day
Because in a day my last time will never wow this year
One two three four
Make sure that you pass through the heaven door
One two three four
Make sure that the early you are on the way
One two three eh eh
Come do the Trinity today
One two three eh eh
Come dance with me me me me
One two three eh eh
Come do the Trinity today
One two three eh eh
If you a dancer, keep on dancing
If you a singer, keep on singing
If you a chatter, keep on chatting
If you a preacher, keep on preaching
If you a leader, keep on leading
If you a teacher, keep on teaching
If you a writer, keep on writing
And if you a musician, keep on playing
One, two, three, eh-eh
Come do the Trinity with me
One, two, three, eh-eh
Come dance with me-me-me-me
One, two, three, eh-eh
Come do the Trinity with me
One, two, three, eh-eh
Devil is trying, trying deceiving
Tell the people don't try, someone is laughing
This is your talent, stop compromising
All you got to come up with is faith and believing
I can do all things, choose Christ I believe in
And give me a life, a life with meaning
He's my kind of stone, pound him me leaning
And we are the unlimited angels
One, two, three, eh eh
Come do the Trinity, eh eh
One, two, three, eh eh
Come dance with me, me, me
One, two, three, eh eh
Come do the Trinity, eh eh
One, two, three, eh eh
You don't really know who's life you are touching
Someone right here maybe going through something
Cause of your dancing and because of your singing
You can make them listen with a different meaning
To find salvation is really a good feeling
How do I know?
Because I've tried the man from that day
I'm a different person
Salvation is easy not demanding
One two three eh eh
Come do the Trinity three
One two three eh eh
Come dance with me me me me
One two three eh eh
Come do the Trinity three
One two three eh eh
