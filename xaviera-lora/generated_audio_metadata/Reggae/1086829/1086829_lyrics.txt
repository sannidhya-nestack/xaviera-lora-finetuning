Sit, sit back, sit, sit, sit back, sit, sit back, sit, sit, sit back
Sit, sit back, sit, sit, sit back, sit back, relax and enjoy
Sit back, relax and enjoy
Sit, sit, sit, sit back, sit, sit, sit back, sit back, relax and enjoy
Spark another spliff up, use the cherry just to keep warm
Walking through the storm as the new day begins to dawn
I'm on the loss of some, I like the death of a daily departed brother
Cause there's no way to energise without the solar rays
The days are too short, caught in a low mind state
And every single damn mistake I've made
Take the easy route
Running through the mud and drinking cider
Last year I did the same as just among the wiser
Hide away these fears
Too ashamed to show my tears
Bearing squinty eyes of pain
See a shine burning me from inside
When it's cold outside
I tend to dream of sunny days
Decide to do is wait and get blazed
Amazing how much fun it is
To laze around in a smoky haze
Tired of waiting for the sun
To burn away my moody fears
I close my eyes and think about the times
Sunshine in a Philly band
But I don't know if I'll ever make it
Until my next sunny day
Whenever I'm down then I find myself just ready for my sunny day
If ever the sun doesn't start to shine then you gotta find another way
No matter what anybody else might say wait for your sunny days
Give it two minutes mate there'll be another slip on the go
Let's make our own sunny day while outside there's almost no moon
I'm sure it's gonna rain again soon so let's just smoke ourselves brainless and watch cartoons
And ignore this shitty feeling of impending doom that the winter time carries with it
Give it a finger wishing that the summer time lingered just a little bit longer
I'm sure that we were stronger then and none of the fit girls have boyfriends
All of the dealers had fat tens
What the fuck happened to that pen?
I'm getting tired of getting wired and having twat friends
I'm that tense
I just need to get lifted
So thank god you're so gifted
With that supercali hydroponic smoke a dosha's green shit
I sit and reminisce about my sunny days
Laze away these long nights and short dates
And get blazed because it helps the time pass
I flow slow
Because my blood's freezing fast
And I don't think I'm gonna last until my next sunny day
Whenever I'm down then I find myself just waiting for my sunny day
If ever the sun doesn't start to shine then you gotta find another way
No matter what anybody else might say wait for your sunny day
I'm still waiting for my sunny day
I'm still waiting for my sunny day
I'm still waiting for my sunny day
I'm still waiting for my sunny day
Sit back, relax and enjoy
