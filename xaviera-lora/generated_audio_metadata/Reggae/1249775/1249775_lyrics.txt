I remember stargazing on summer nights
Counting constellations by the dim moonlight
We'd whisper secrets to the twinkling stars above
Feel like we were children of the universe, so in love
We are children of the universe
Dancing through the galaxies
Feeling the cosmic force
With star dust in our veins we're shining bright
Together we'll explore the endless cosmic night
Sailing paper boats down the Milky Way
Chasing comets letting worries drift away
Our dreams float higher than the planets in the sky
We believed we could touch the stars if we tried
We are children of the universe
Dancing through the galaxies
Feeling the cosmic force
With stardust in our veins we're shining bright
Together we'll explore the endless cosmic night
Blue black holes and shooting stars will wander far
Navigating unknown realms hand in hand
Time may pass and galaxies may collide
But our bond is cosmic kids will never be denied
We are children of the universe
Dancing through the galaxies
Feeling the cosmic force
With stars outstretched our veins we're shining bright
Together we'll explore the endless cosmic night
So let's keep dreaming, reaching for the sky
For we are children of the universe, you and I
