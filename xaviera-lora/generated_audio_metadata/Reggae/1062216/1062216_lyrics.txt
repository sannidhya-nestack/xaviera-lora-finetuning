She's been a job
From one extreme to another
From hate to love
Let's groove, let's groove
From one extreme to another
From hate to love
That's what I'm dreaming of
World a confusion, everybody distant
Lovers and friends nobody could ever count on
Dissimilation, cause separation
See the big picture, spell the conclusion
But it's the matter nobody want fi blend
Violence and anger we must transcend
If everybody make a brand new friend
We'll be much more united, much better then
Love each other with no false pretend
And see the whole world transcend
'Cause love is what we need, yeah
From one extreme to another
From hate to love
Let's groove, let's groove
From one extreme to another
From hate to love
That's what I'm dreaming of, yeah
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, La, la, la, la, La, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La la la la la la la la la la la la
How could a person never succeed?
Heart full of misery, mind full of greed
Constantly that what the whole world believe
Me first attitude then I'll perceive
The selfish, envy, war philosophy
Think about the fear second everybody hear me
Love, unity, prosperity
A part of the world that seldomly see
Love each other with no false pretend
And see the whole world transcend
love is what we need, yeah
From one extreme to another
From hate to love
Let's go, let's go
From one extreme to another
From hate to love
That's what I'm dreaming of
La la la la la la la la la la la la
Sing la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Sing la la
Children of Jah sing la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Children of Jah sing la la
Hey people let me tell you why
Love, unity, prosperity
We can live our lives
Without love, unity, prosperity, triumphs are lost
From one extreme to another
From hate to love, let's groove
From one extreme to another
From hate to love
That's what I'm dreaming of
From one extreme to another
From hate to love
La la la (ja ja ja ja)
Sing la la (from one extreme to another)
From hate to love
