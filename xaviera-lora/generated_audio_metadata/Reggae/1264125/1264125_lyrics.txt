They'll et about us in the shadows we stand
Whispers in the wind left out of their plans
We fade in the night with dreams unspoken
Hearts made of glass so easily broken
But we won't vanish, we won't disappear
In the silence fighting with every single cheer
They overlook our cries, don't see our tears
In the crowd we're lost, hidden by fears
Invisible but here we'll rise above
From the dark, we'll shine with strength and love
But we won't vanish
We won't disappear
In silence, fighting with every single cheer
They overlook our cries, don't see our tears
In the crowd, we're lost, hidden by fears
Invisible but here we'll rise above
From the dark we'll shine with strength of love
But we won't vanish
We won't disappear
In the silence fighting with every single cheer
