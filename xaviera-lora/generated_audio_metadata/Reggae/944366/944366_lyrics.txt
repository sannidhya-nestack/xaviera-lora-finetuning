Your Russian movements
Classy fresco by the girl em star
You know how me and the girl em par
View them close not far
Pull G string like guitar
Real life no Skylar
Girl you are the perfect distraction
When you whine in front of me
Girl you are the perfect view
Don't say no one but girl you are the perfect distraction
Come give me what me want fi see (Gyal you are the perfect view)
Don't say no one but
I come fi match your wine, match your wine, match your wine
Take, take, take, take, take your waistline lower (take your waistline lower)
Take your waistline lower (oh oh oh oh)
Don't come fi waste your time, waste your time, waste your time
Gyal brace make your waistline show off (show off, show off, show off)
Make your waistline show off (show off, show off, show off)
Gyal you are the perfect distraction (ah ah ah)
When you whine in front of me
Girl you are the perfect view
Don't see no one but you
Girl you are the perfect distraction
Come give me what me want fi see it be
You are the perfect view
Don't see no one but you
So if you dash it me a catch it
And if you fling it me a zing it
And if you rock it then you roll it
You better know if you bring it
So if I watch you like TV
Shake your bumper in HD
Call you a villain and blu ray
You whine wicked and facey
Call you are the perfect distraction
When you whine in front of me
Call you are the perfect view
Don't say no one but
Call you are the perfect distraction
Come give me what me want fi see
Gal you are the perfect view
Don't see no one but
I come fi match your wine
Match your wine
Match your wine
Take take take take
Take your waistline lower
Take your waistline lower
Don't come fi waste your time
Waste your time
Waste your time
Gal Grace make your waistline show off
Make your waistline show off
Gal you are the perfect distraction
When you whine in front of me
Girl you are the perfect view
Don't see no one but you
Girl you are the perfect distraction
Come give me what me want fi see eh eh
Girl you are the perfect view
Don't see no one but you
