I don't know if this love is true
I don't know if it's a demolition or a sign
I'm telling this to you
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
I don't need surprises
Just my love
Na na na na na na na na na na
And a genuine love in her
Tell me she'll be there for me
She tells me that she cares for me
She will be there for me
Keep on caring for me
Tell me she'll be there for me
One, two, three she cares for me
She will be there for me
Keep on caring for me
The love me have could never change from you
Girl don't you know my love is true
And when you're sad I'll be there for you
Me ready fi paint your grey skies blue
My love could never be diminished still remains the same
Love is genuine this is no game
Not for them I try to turn the feelings on man it's so insane
I'm starting to wear me spite upon their face
Woman in the Bay I don't know you got a special place
If you want my warm embrace
Girl whatever it takes to put that smile on your face
See I don't want this love to go to waste
Tell me she'll be there for me
She tells me that she cares for me
She will be there for me
Keep on caring for me
Tell me she'll be there for me
Woman she says she cares for me
She will be there for me
Keep on caring for me
When the rain start fall and the night gets cold
Come on my love and satisfy your soul
Moments like we share worth more than gold
On this moon the world will know
Girl like the wind in the tropics and blows
Girl like the lily in the gardens and grows
Just like the water from the fountain that flows
My love will sweep you off while you dance
Don't she take care of me
Always be there for me
God the answer my default
The taste know when to wait for me
Always wanna be near to me
Food well prepared for me
Even when she's up on her seat
She'll try to spare for me
Tell me she'll be there for me
She tells me that she cares for me
She will be there for me
Keep on caring for me
Telling me she'll be there for me
Won't you say she cares for me
She will be there for me
Keep on caring for me
Meow!
Meow!
Meow!
