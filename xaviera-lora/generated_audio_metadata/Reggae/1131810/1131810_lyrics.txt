I love you madly
More than my life
More than words truly say
One look at you
Takes my breath clean away
And I, I can't stay away
You are my lover
And I make this vow to you
That I'll always love you
And I wanna make you, make you happy
I've got to show you how much I want you
Whatever it takes you can see
And if I have to lay my life on the line that's
I've got to show you how much I want you
Whatever it takes you to see
And if I have to leave my life on the line
That's the way it'll be
The truth is simple, it's so simple it hurts
I'm ready and willing to show you
I can make you, make you happy
I've got to show you how much I want you
Whatever it takes you to see
And if I have to lay my life on the line
That's the way it'll be
I've got to show you how much I want you
Whatever it takes you to see
And if I have to lay my life on the line
That's the way it'll be
I stand before you, a queen with a king
And I'll always follow the love I have with me
I've got to show you how much I want you
Whatever it takes, you'll see
And if I have to lay my life on the line
That's the way it'll be
I've got to show you how much I want you
Whatever it takes, you'll see
And if I have to lay my life on the line
That's the way it'll be
Got to show you, you know that I want you, however it takes you to see
