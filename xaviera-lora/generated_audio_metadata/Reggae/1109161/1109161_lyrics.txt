If you find
If you find you hurting
It means you are alive
If you find
If you find you learning
Then you're wise
It's a mighty fine cradle we're in
This cradle of life
It's a mighty fine thing we begin
This thing we call life
You get it, you get it, you get it
You got it
You did it, you did it, you did it, you got here
If you find, if you find you're seeing
What others do not see
If you find, if you are believing
Then you're free
It's a mighty fine cradle we're in
This cradle of life
It's a mighty fine thing we begin
This thing we call life
If you find, if you find you're thirsty
Then you drink from the fruit
If you find, if you find you're hungry
Eat from the root, it's a mighty fine cradle
We're in this cradle of life
It's a mighty fine thing we begin
This thing we call life
It's a mighty fine cradle we're in
This cradle of life
It's a mighty fine thing we begin
This thing we call life
It's a mighty fine cradle we're in
This cradle of life
It's a mighty fine thing we begin
This thing we call life
It's a mighty fine cradle we're in
This cradle of life
It's a mighty fine thing we begin
This thing we call life
