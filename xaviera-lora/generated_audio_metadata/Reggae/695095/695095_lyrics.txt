Emotions fill me, fill my head
I don't want to feel empty
Do what you said
Passion fills me inside me
'Cause I want you, baby, fulfill me
Yeah, I feel so honey right now
You know why, I know how
I feel so horny right now
So damn horny right now
I, I, I, I, yeah
So damn, so damn
Yeah, I feel so horny right now
You know why, I know how
I feel so horny right now
So damn horny right now
Gotta please myself baby and quiet the storm
Don't silence me, baby, just free me
Passion fills me inside me
I want you, baby, fulfilled
Yeah, I feel so horny right now
You know why, I know how
I feel so horny right now
So damn horny right now
I want to save me from myself
But I'm losing control
Hold me down
It's my mission to get you beside me
I want you, baby, be with me
Yeah, I feel so horny right now
You know why, I know how
I feel so horny right now
So damn horny right now
Slow down
Slow me down
You hold me down, boy
Yeah, hold me down, boy
