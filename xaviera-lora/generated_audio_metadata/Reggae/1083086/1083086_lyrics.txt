I'm losing my sanity, you take me under, for you I surrender (for you I surrender)
You make me land on, other side of gravity
Boy you got me under, boy you got me fond of, yeah boy you got me in love
You got my soul, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You let me fall, you let me go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now you're gonna see it, gonna see it clearly
Know what I'm doing, yeah, gonna see it clearly
You can't ignore it, know what you wanna see, know what you need, know what you need to me (yeah)
I'm losing my sanity
You take me under
For you I surrender
I gave up on my life for you
Commits the way I'm moving the rightest places
Commits the way I know it you'll never replace this
I'll be waiting for it see the look upon your face
The day you come back to it realize that you've been replaced
You got my soul, oh
You let me fly you let me go, oh
I'm gonna see it, gonna see it clearer
You got my soul, oh
You let me fall, you let me go, oh
Now you're gonna see it, gonna see it clearly
Goin' on the weekend, gonna see it clearly
You can't ignore it, but it's you
All this weakness should be emotional
Go back to me, ay, ay
Go back to me, ay, ay
You got my soul
You got my soul
Now you're gonna see it, gonna see it clearly (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You got my soul, oh
You let me fall, you let me go, oh
Now you're gonna see it, gonna see it clearly
You got my soul, oh
You let me fall, you let me go, oh
Now you're gonna see it, gonna see it
