Flags inna di air

Mo'a say we flag inna di air

Dem call me mechanic
The waistline mechanic
Girl mi have the oil fi handle the road
Girl cock up your bonnet
Big engine you have it
And mi have the tools fi handle the load
So if mi wine on you bend your corner
In the shunky press the starter
We spin like a steering wheel
Unified pulling up to your bumper
Whether Benz, Toyota or Honda
Don't brought down cause we jamming still
Cali away spinning spinning spinning like a tyre
Spinning spinning spinning like a tyre
I pray that the wheel don't bust
Backing up on the Lambo truck
Spinning spinning spinning like a tyre
Spinning spinning spinning like a tyre
I pray that the wheel don't bust
Backing up on the Lambo truck
They will call me mechanic
The waistline mechanic
And you need some new maintenance
Pen over don't panic
Check on the carriage
Blame me why because you check overdrawn
When you rev it up make me feel it
I tell you a secret
Roll on to the big stick shift
Roll on to the big stick shift
Rev it up make me feel it
I tell you a secret
I come here to make me shift
I come here to make mischief
Spinning, spinning, spinning like a tyre
Spinning, spinning, spinning like a tyre
I pray that the wheel don't bust
Back it up on the Lambo truck
Spinning, spinning, spinning like a tyre
Spinning, spinning, spinning like a tyre
I pray that the wheel don't bust
Back it up on the Lambo truck

Calc a cup ya bad it, big engine ya have it
And me have the tools fi handle the load
