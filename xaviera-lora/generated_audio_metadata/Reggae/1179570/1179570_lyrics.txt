Eastward bound (eastward bound)
To find some tranquility (ooh)
Leaving Rome (leaving Rome)
To Africa, the motherland (Africa, yeah)
It's right back (it's right back)
To find some tranquility
Leaving Rome (leaving Rome)
To Africa, the motherland
Tired of the operation here in Babylon
Everything you do they say you wrong
Can't even meditate in your own yard
Life is so hard
Every day it's the same rat race
And everybody running down the dollar (dollar, dollar, dollar)
Working so hard for so little
Can't even pay the cost of living
Peaceful bands (peaceful bands)
To find some tranquility
Leaving Rome
To Africa, the motherland
East-West bound
To find some tranquility
Leaving Rome (leaving Rome)
To Africa, the motherland (Africa, yeah)
Le le le le le le le le le le le mama mama

More and more pressure everyday
As we trying to survive
There seems to be no love for humanity
Just love for the money
I am going to a land where there's a place
For so many, for so many babies
Why should we cram ourselves in big cities
When the land is so plenty
It's for a bath (it's for a bath)
To find some tranquility (ooh)
Living room (living room)
To Africa, the motherland
It's well and bound
To find some tranquility
Leaving Rome
To Africa, the motherland
It's very bad (it's very bad)
To find some tranquility (ooh)
Leaving Rome (leaving Rome)
To Africa, motherland
Yep
