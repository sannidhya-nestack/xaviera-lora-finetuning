Who I, tell them don't take no step for I
You lose your mind, what me say?
You have two type of people in life you know
One that always get push around by lie
And one take control of life
But there's a right and a wrong way to take care of life what?
Sugar, I, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best of all best
When you got the lit inna the east and out the south and the west
Sugar, there ain't nothing more nothing less
If you tired go home and take a rest
Love you come from the east I man a child from the west
My parents dem poor but dem try dem best
Going to school, me never have a kid past it
Me have to wait until granny come from market
Never have no boss feel so me have to work it
Never have no game machine so time me have to make it
No more reaching for me goal not tell I can't make it
Just put me to the test and show God He will prove it
That I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, say Paul best
When I got the lit inna the east and out the south and the west
Sugar D, I ain't nothing more nothing less
If you tired go home and take a rest
I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best of all best
When I got the lit inna the east and out the south and the west
Sugar D, I ain't nothing more nothing less
If you tired go home and take a rest
Drum here can you, dem dem are the greatest
Inna the reggae music, Bob Marley are the greatest
On the dancehall scene, we are the greatest
Inna this I can feel, we are the greatest
We have the fastest runner inna history
We two world record put the world in a mystery
We have math, social studies, science and english
Eat my parents and pour a rich
I am the best, I'm the best, I'm the best of all best
When I go tell it in the east and out the south and the west
Sugar D, I eat nothing more nothing less
If you tired go home and take a rest
Cause I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best of all best
When I go tell it in the east and out the south and the west
Sugar D, I eat nothing more nothing less
If you tired go home and take a rest
My condition make who I am
So anytime you see me now think where I from
Now where me belong this is the way I travel
Listen to the message when me have inna me song
My circumstances make me eat rat bottom
With the help of the father me I overcome
By the wrath and thy staff they dem can't hold me down
With the viburnum me add a charge into the kingdom
Cause I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best of all best
Unno got a little of the east and all the south and the west
So godly, I ain't nothing more nothing less
If you tired go home and take a rest
I am here with the music just to make unno die in jest
Cause I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best of all best
Who do got the little of the east and all the south and the west
Sugar D, I ain't nothing more nothing less
Me no come from the east, I man a child from the west
Me parents dem poor but dem try dem best
Going to school, me never have a kid basket
Me have to wait until granny come from market
Never have no bus feel so me have to work it
Never have no game machine so time me have to make it
Throw me climbing from me goal until like I can't make it
Just put me to the test and sugar D will prove it
That I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best of all best
Only got a little of the east and a lot of the south and the west
Sugar D, I eat nothing more nothing less
If you tired go home and take a rest I am here
With the music just to make you no digest
I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best of all best
Only got the lit inna the east and out the south and the west
Sugar D, I ain't nothing more nothing less
I'm the best, I'm the best ,I'm the best of all best
Only got the lit inna the east and out the south and the west
Sugar D, I ain't nothing more nothing less
If you tired go home and take a rest
I am here with the music just to make you no digest
I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best of all best
Only got the lit inna the east and out the south and the west
Sugar D, I ain't nothing more nothing less
