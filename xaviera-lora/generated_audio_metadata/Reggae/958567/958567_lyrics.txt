Ooh yeah
Let's do it today yeah
Oh oh ah yeah
See
Because today
Because today
We gotta put the guns away
No more pain
And no more sorrow
Because today
Because today
We gotta put those bombs away
For our children
And their tomorrow
Think about this world that we're living in
And the bad news everyday
So much dying and so much crying
Unnecessarily
Don't you think it's time that we stop this crime
And bring back the smiling face
Peace and love and harmony
Throughout this world in every place
Because today, because today
We gotta put the guns away
No more pain
And no more sorrow
Because today, because today
We gotta put those bombs away
For our children, yeah
And their tomorrow
Put the guns away
We got to live and let live
Don't take without giving
Begin from within
We living, we living
Rainy days will come oh yeah
But sun will shine on through
Bring the hope, peace and love
Chorus for me and you
Freedom from within (freedom, freedom)
We can't do without (yeah)
Hand in hand we'll win (hand in hand)
What's it all about? (yeah)
Freedom from within (Freedom, freedom)
We can't do without (We can't do without)
Hand in hand we'll win
What's it all about?
Because today
Because today
We gotta put the guns away
No more pain (no more pain)
And no more sorrow (no more sorrow)
Because today
Because today
We gotta put those bombs away
For our children (no more pain)
And their tomorrow, yeah
Yeah, I, we
