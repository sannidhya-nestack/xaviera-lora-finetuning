Thanks a lot, it's good to see you again, my faithful friend
You lead me on, to your quiet place and the heartache's gone
It won't be long, till my burdens ease and my heart is strong
I'm not surprised, life is easy when our worlds combine
So I will run to you and fall into your arms
And I will hold on to, and I will hold on to you
And if it takes us all summer long
And the last warm days are gone
I will wait for you, I will wait for you, I will wait for you
It's hard to see
Till my thoughts are still and not drifting free
You show me true
The depth of love that will bring me through
So I will run to you
And fall into your arms
And I will hold on to
And I will hold on to you
And if the days are summer long
And the last warm days are gone
I will wait for you, I will wait for you, I will wait for you
So I will run to you and fall into your arms
And I will hold on to, and I will hold on to you
And if it takes all summer long and the last warm days are gone
I will wait for you, I will wait
I will wait for you, I will wait
I will wait for you, I will wait for you
I will wait for you
