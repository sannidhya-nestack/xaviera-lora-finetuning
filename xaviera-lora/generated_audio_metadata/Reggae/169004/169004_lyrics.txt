Hold it down, hold it down
Every single little thing a be alright
Keep it crystal, turn and twist
Big song we play make you ball up a dis
Hold it down, hold it down
Every single little thing a be alright
Keep it crystal, turn and twist
Big song we play make you ball up a dis
Bring out the money now they know not deny
Tell them not worry about the boss and the pie
Tell them the regular mills a bond and delight
'Cause you know it like I say party night
In here I'll just find a mid-bitch
Mid-bitch and I'm straight down at the bottom
But I don't know what type they with
If you're in my trap
What I'm gonna grab up the whip
You can spend the night
Middle of the night going up in the place
Go up and get the bat
Cool, tell everybody in the brush
I got boyfriend here
And I'm about to be out'cause I fuck
Holy Town, Holy Town
Every single nigga think I'll be alright
Keep it crisp, girl, turn and twist
Big song we play make ya ball out pay dis
Hold it down, hold it down
Every single licky ting a be alright
Keep it crisp, girl, turn and twist
Big song we play make ya ball out pay dis
Like a baby from a brother and boss
Choke a macro boy with well-laid jaws
Hold up me hip from all the side
I put up my pencil on the dust
Jot down your progress double-dotted papers
Just because dem boy come fit flex
Never call a son that dem won't hit the deck
Time for me be proper it's time busy
But if it's delicate girl just wait up for me
Thunder or Michael Ogan MC
Pon pon the ganja like Bob Marley
Hold it down, hold it down
Every single little thing will be alright
Keep it crisp, girl, turn and twist
Big song we play make you ball out with it
Hold it down, hold it down
Every single little thing will be alright
Keep it crisp, girl, turn and twist
Big song we play make you ball out with it
Prince on the tee, take the life of somebody
Bite the pity dime, cop a nickel on a penny
When the mind are realist but reality is selfish
Lord God hear me pray
My blood's boiling now the hearts on rise
Next mind God did say there's no surprise
What prevails life we cannot supersize
No longer have a lead on lies
What prevails witness look at all them eyes
Love the golden dynamo but it's not so wise
Love only of others who will take the prize
Or with the righteousness we exercise
Hold it down, hold it down
Every single little thing a be alright
Keep it crisp, girl, turn and twist
Big song we play make ya ball out be dis
Hold it down, hold it down
Every single little thing a be alright
Keep it crisp, girl, turn and twist
Big song we play make ya ball out be dis
Hold it down, hold it down
Every single little thing a be alright
Keep it crystal, turn and twist
Fix all the way play make ya ball out pay dis
Hold it down, hold it down
Every single little thing a be alright
Keep it crystal, turn and twist
Fix all the way play make ya ball out pay dis
