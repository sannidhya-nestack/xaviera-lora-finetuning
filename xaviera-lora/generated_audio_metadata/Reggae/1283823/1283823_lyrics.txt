I'm going to live, I'm going to live my life
Why should I live my life to please you and not me
Why would you think that you control my destiny
Why would I worry myself of what you say
Why should I have faith when I know that I can't break
You try to dismantle me with your gentle mouth
So that I may fall but I didn't wreck my path
I must separate myself from you and keep myself apart
By your words of deceit, I know you don't have my best interest at heart
Tell me why should I leave my life to please you and not me?
Why would you think that you control my destiny?
Why would I worry myself of what you say?
Why should I fret when I know that I can pray
I'm not gonna sit around just waiting on you
I'm a son of the most high I've got greater work to do
Mama used to say her promises are come true to a fool
I know that Jah will make my enemies become my footstool
Just tell me why should I leave my life to please you and not me?
Why would you think that you control my destiny?
Why would I worry myself over what you say?
Why should I fret when I know that I can pray?
People will come into your life and they will go
Sometimes it's hard to tell who's your friend from who's your foe
But I'll keep the enemies closer and keep my so called friends close
Because the same one with whom you share your bread
Will be the one to try and take you out
So tell me what should I
Leave my life to please you and not me
Why would you think that you control my destiny
Why would I worry myself over what you say
Why should I fret when I know that I can pray anyway
Should I worry myself over what you say
Now I can pray
I'm gonna live my life, Joey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So tell me why should I
