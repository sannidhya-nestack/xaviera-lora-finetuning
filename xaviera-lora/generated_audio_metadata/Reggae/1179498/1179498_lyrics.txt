You are the nicest thing that ever happened in my life
You're sweet in my days
You're light in my nights
I've never met anyone like you
You're a special person
I'm telling you girl
You are for real
You've got it all
You've got it all
You've got it all
You've got it all
You're beautiful
And full of class
You're so intelligent
And so exciting
You're so ambitious
And adventurous for you girl
Sky is the limit
You've got it all
You've got it all
You've got it all
You've got it all
You've got what it takes
To make me crazy for you
My love grows stronger
Every day for you
You're all that I want
And all that I need
Oh baby
You make my life complete
You've got it all
You've got it all
You've got it all
You've got it all
You've got it all
You've got it all
You've got it all
You've got it all
