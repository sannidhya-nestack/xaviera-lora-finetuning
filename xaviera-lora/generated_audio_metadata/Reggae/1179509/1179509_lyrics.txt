I've been trying so hard to make things right
But I just can't get the cooperation
Others put pressure on me
Oh what a shame they're trying to keep me down
I can't give up, no way, I've gotta be strong
I can't give up, no way, I've gotta move on
I can't give up, no way, I've gotta be strong
I can't give up, no way, I've gotta move on
I've been depending on others for so long
But they keep on letting me down
It's time to move on and do my own thing
It's time to move on and be my own man
I can't give up, no way, I've gotta be strong
I can't give up, no way, I gotta move on
I can't give up, no way, I've gotta be strong
I can't give up
No way, I've gotta move on
I won't sit down and waste my time
Let them confuse my mind
They're not serious in what they do
I won't let them bring me down
I can't give up, no way
I've gotta be strong
I can't give up, no way
I've gotta move on
I can't give up, no way
I've gotta be strong
I can't give up, no way
I've gotta move on
I can't give up, no way
I've gotta be strong
I can't give up
