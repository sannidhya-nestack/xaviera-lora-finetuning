Bob Marley, Bob Marley
Close your eyes and you'll see Bob Marley
Riding through holy Ethiopia on his Harley
Heading up to Highland, up above
Reaching Rastafarian love
A Rastafarian love
A Rastafarian love
A Rastafarian love
A Rastafarian love
Bob Marley
Bob Marley
Born in Jamaica in 1945
All his life he struggled to survive
Born on his grandfather's Jamaican farm where
He taught Bob about his Jewish roots there
Oh, Aquarium brother of the soul
So many loved you more than you could know
You preached peace, you preached love
In harmony with the one above
They tried to stop you from telling what's true
They broke your house and they shot you
Two days later you went back on stage
All their hate couldn't keep you in their cage
You then went in exile to London town
To get away from the howling bloodhounds
You were very ill, you were toast
But the treatment went against your religious code
Bob Marley
Bob Marley
You went to a clinic in a Bavarian town
You looked for a cure but none could be found
But it was too late to save you, tough gun
Bob Marley passed away in'81
His final words to his son and wife
Where money can't buy you life
For money
No money can't buy you life
Can't buy you life
Oh, Aquarium brother of the soul (of the soul)
So many loved you more than you could know
You preach peace
And you preached love in harmony with the one above

Bob Marley, Bob Marley
Can you see me? Bob Marley
Right through Holyhead, up Europe's alley
Heading up to a highly up above
Preaching Rastafarian love
Rastafarian love
Rastafarian love
Rastafarian love
Rastafarian love
