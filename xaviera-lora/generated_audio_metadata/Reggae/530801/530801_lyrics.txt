Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa
Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa
Well the day that I first met you
Was the day you stole my heart
I knew that I'd always love you
Right from the very start
You ask me will I still love you
When the years go rolling by
The day you see me walk on water
That's the day my love will die
Oh, oh, oh
Well, you made me so very happy
You got my heart to sing
You gave me love and affection
Now I wear your wedding ring
You ask me how much I love you
Until the seas they all run dry
The day you see me walk on water
That's the day my love will die
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Until that sun refused to shine
I'll love you'til the end of time
You better believe it
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Made me so very happy
You taught my heart to sing
You gave me love and affection
Now I wear your wedding ring
Ask me how much I love you
Until the seas they all run dry
The day you see me walk on water
That's the day my love will die
Until the sun refused to shine
I'll love you'til the end of time
You better believe it
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Made me so very happy
You taught my heart to sing
You gave me love and affection
Now I wear your wedding ring
You ask me how much I love you
Until the seas they all run dry
The day you see me walk on water
That's the day my love will die
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
