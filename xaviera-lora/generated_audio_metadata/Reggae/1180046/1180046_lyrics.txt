I look around, see children suffering
Wondering what's really happening
Some from broken homes, need no parents to guide them
It's their duty to lead so they can follow
'Cause they will be the men and women of tomorrow
Hey, we gotta teach them
We gotta show them
We gotta guide them
We got to protect them
Hey, we gotta teach them
We gotta show them
We gotta guide them
We got to protect them
Some may be living in sorrow
But there's hope for tomorrow
Lift your head up high
Let me see the sky
We are role models
Let's mould the youth
'Cause they will be the kings and queens of tomorrow
Hey, we gotta teach them
We gotta show them
We gotta guide them
We got to protect them
Hey, we gotta teach them
We gotta show them
We gotta guide them
We got to protect them
Hey
We gotta teach them
We gotta show them
We gotta guide them
We got to protect them, hey
We gotta teach them
We gotta show them
We gotta guide them
We got to protect them, hey
The future of the youth are in our hands
Let's bend the trees while they're young
Set them straight from the start
Show them the right path
Let's make sure we're doing our part
Hey hey, we gotta teach them
We got to guide them, we got to show them, we got to protect them, hey, we got to teach them, we got to show them, we got to guide them, we got to protect them, hey, hey, we got to teach them
We gotta guide them, we gotta show them, we got to protect them, hey, hey, we gotta teach them, we gotta show them, we gotta guide them
