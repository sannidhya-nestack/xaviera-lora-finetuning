You see it, so me tell them they mustn't cheat, pop stick inna dem ears and even me pick out dem teeth, you see it, so me tell them they mustn't cheat, dem come stir up the fire now they can't stand the heat, me climbing up the chart, watch this like black people climbing up the ladder
Me tell this generation stop fight one another
Me tell them fi love up dem sisters and brother
And behind me back is like David and Goliath
Me step out inna the street and then me cite pure riot
Me shout out yo people keep quiet
Unno fi listen to the jump and the bass and the ayat
Not even unno government, ya people no quiet
Stop run from yourself, stop fight against yourself
Unno the almighty God can give unno a help
So run by some wicked and evil lost people
So strike the road it surround with vehicle
Keep your mind pure and don't study evil
Make the holy spirit use you like a vehicle
You see it?
So me tell dem dem muslim children
Pop stick inna dem ears and even pick out dem teeth
You see it?
So me tell them they mustn't cheat, them come stir up the fire, now them can't stand the heat
Tell them time for you rise from your sleep
Tell them this is not no time for you dream
So many life you make God down the jail, no no tell me
People that wish to be blamed, no no see it
So many parents feel shame and no tell me people a who a feel the pain
See three Jamaica eater grew up in a flames and the garrison community always a blame
Seems like me bigger heads dem a play game
Bigger heads let the pain and garrison take the chain
If the two life evil then why it no be the same?
Dem a blame dem government just to make things better
Before it get better it gets worse (shoo) you see it?
So me tell dem dem uss n'cheat
Paps, di kinna dem jes a need ma pick out dem teet
You see it?
So me tell dem dem uss n'cheet
Dem come stir up di fire now dem just stand di eat
You see it?
So me tell dem dem uss n'cheat
Paps, di kinna dem jes a need ma pick out dem teet
You see it?
So mi tell dem dem musn't cheat, dem come stir up the fire now dem can't stand the heat
Mi granny used to say mi nah go live fi see dem days, ya but now mi live fi see it make me amazed
Over dem ya situation ya make me catch fright
Sometime mi give no feel, fi walk out a parade
Have war and crime full up the youth dem ways
Mi see war and rumours of war
Mi see nation rise up against nation
And I see kingdom rise up against kingdom
But mi say look up
Call you redemption, draenei we surround by vampires and spies
And no little fight, the hypocrite dem did fight
And no little back bite, the hypocrite back bite
You see it? Some me tell dem dem must not cheat
Pop stick inna dem ears and even pick out dem teeth
You see it? Some me tell dem dem must not cheat
Dem come stir up the fire now dem cast on the east
