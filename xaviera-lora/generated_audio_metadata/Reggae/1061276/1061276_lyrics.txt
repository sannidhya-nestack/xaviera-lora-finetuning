Why is love so much confusion? Mixed up emotions, a lasting illusion
Why is love so much confusion? Mixed up emotions, a lasting illusion
How many days me die a long time with this pain
With an upset stomach cause a giant pig migraine
Head full of promise don me paddle on the lane and as me a bull
Dream of the toba baby which drain water run from me eye
Even couldn't stop cry
Drop to me knees ask father god why
Anything that she want I would a give her the sky
Put a hooks in me heart then she walk out of me life
Sometimes me feel she do the whole thing for spite
Do whole thing no right why is love
So much confusion
Mixed up emotions
A lasting illusion
Why is love
So much confusion
Mixed up emotions
A lasting illusion
I can remember all the time the little things that we share
Moments together in my blue cavalier
Staring into the sky with twinkles in my eye
Making all types of promises we never say bye
Having dinner with the family each and every Sunday night
And me for a second make me please rhyme
Me had a recollection so deep it make me sob and cry
Who the trigger on you have to call and say hi
To wish me a fever and me a wonder say why
The whole thing not right why is love
So much confusion
Mixed up emotions
A lasting illusion
Why is love
So much confusion
Mixed up emotions
A lasting illusion
Why is love this way
Why is love this way
I don't understand it
I can't figure it out
Why is love this way
Why is love this way?
Why is love
So much confusion
Mixed up emotions
A lasting illusion
Why is love
So much confusion
Mixed up emotions
A lasting illusion
Why is love this way?
Why is love this way?
I don't understand it (Why is love, love, love this way?)
I can't figure it out
Why is love this way? (Why is love)
Why is love this way? (Why is love?)
Hey, hey, hey
Why is love, why is love this way?
