There's some things that I need to say to ya
Let me tell ya how I feel about ya
All I do is think about you (one and only you)
All I see are your eyes (I didn't pay all ways)
All I wanted just to hold you (arms around you)
Baby all I need are your arms around me
And I just want to be so close
And I just want to touch you (touch me girl, touch me girl)
And I just need to hear your voice (again and again and again)
And I hope that you'll hear me too (so I gotta tell you)
I totally love you
I feel so much, I can't try to rush
As the days and nights go, it's only love
I feel so much, I can't try to rush
As the days and nights go
Now here I stand with arms wide open
As I give myself to you (one and only you)
But you don't know just how I'm feeling (I got, I got a feeling)
I want all the best for you
And I just want to feel
So close to ya
And I just want to touch you
Touch me girl, touch me girl
And I just need to hear your voice
Again and again and again
And I hope that you'll hear me too
So I gotta tell you it's only love
I feel so much, I can't try to rush, as the days and nights go on (days and nights go on)
So much love, I feel so much, I can't try to rush, as the days and nights go on (days and nights go on)
Let me tell you what I do
All I do is think about you
One and only you
All I see are your eyes
All I do is think about you (while I'm lonely)
All I see are your eyes (night and day always)
All I want is just to hold you (arms around me)
All I need are your arms around me (here's what we're going to do)
Feel me girl, feel me girl, I need to have you in my life
I'm the man I wanna be when I'm with you
Can't you see that everything I say is true?
I'll do whatever it is you want me to do
To get to you
It's totally love
I feel so much
I can't try to rush
As the days and nights go on
It's totally love
I feel so much
I can't try to rush
As the days and nights go on
It's totally love
I feel so much
I feel so much, I feel so much as the days and nights go on
