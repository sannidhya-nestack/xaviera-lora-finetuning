Everybody just tell the people it's all about love
Spread the wealth, thank the good Lord's Son
Tell the children there's no room for hate
Share the planet and the supper plate
There's enough for everyone
Give your heart and the world becomes one
Becomes one
See the land is good
And the crops grow tall
The harvest should
Be enough for all
But the food is sent
To a far away place
And the children wait for the scraps to fall
From the side of the rich man's plate
Everybody just tell the people it's all about love
Spread the wealth, thank the good Lord's son
Tell the children there's no room for hate
Share the planet in the supper plate
There's enough for everyone
Give your heart and the world
Becomes one, becomes one
See the poor man beg
Cause he has no choice
The work don't pay
And he has no voice
To call for change
And his pride's too strong
So he stands on the street with his two young boys
Ignored as the world moves on
Everybody just tell the people it's all about love
Spread the wealth, thank the good Lord's Son
Tell the children there's no room for hate
Share the planets and the supper plate
There's enough for everyone
Give your heart and the world becomes one
Well, the calf and the lion will lie together
And the child will play with the snake
Here in paradise, today is forever
Tomorrow is a dream that never goes away
So tell the people it's all about love
Spread the wealth, thank the good Lord, son
Tell the children there's no room for hate
Share the planet and the supper plate
There's enough for everyone
Give your heart and the world becomes one
Becomes one (becomes one)
Yeah the world becomes one (oh yeah)
Becomes one (yeah the world becomes one)
Becomes one (yeah the world becomes one)
Becomes one
