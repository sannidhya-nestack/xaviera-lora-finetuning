You walk in, and the room rearranges
Every glance feels like flipping the pages of a story
I thought I had written before, but you're the twist I can't ignore
Something in the way you draw me near, feels like I've been waiting years
Pull me closer, don't let go
I'm tangled in a rhythm only you could show
Pull me closer, make it true
Every beat I breathe is reaching out to you
We collide in a moment that lingers
Every spark traced by invisible fingers
You're the reason the silence begins to move
Every note is proof of you
Something in the way you draw me near
Feels like I've been waiting years
Pull me closer, don't let go
I'm tangled in a rhythm only you could show
Pull me closer, make it true
Every beat I breathe is reaching out to you
Don't stop the motion
Let it unwind through worlds
Crossing on a single line
Every second I know it's right
Pull me closer tonight
(Ahhhh)
Pull me closer, don't let go
I'm tangled in a rhythm only you could show
Pull me closer, make it new
Every step I take is leading back to you
Pull me closer, closer to you
Pull me closer, yeah yeah yeah
Pull me closer
Closer to you, oh
