Start the graph and run the x and y axis
How to write is follow unit class axis
Next Friday I have a test if you pass this
No worries, it's straight mathics
Senior year last course is a calculus
The math that Zoom teaches everyday is helpless
Math itself's little derivative is
It's the opposite of integrating
Use the Product Rule and then the Quotient Rule too
F (x )dG (x) sum with GD (f) again
F (x )dG (x) sum with GD (f)
Df over g is gdf minus fdg all over gg
Functions f and gd stands for derivative of
Df over g is gdf minus fdge all over gg
This continuity graph aid for you to see
Some removable or to infinity
Others jump
Others jump
Others jump
Memorize these
Derive the sine and you get the cosine
The cosine return negative sine
e to the x is e to the x
Natural log x is 1 over x
Remember chain rule
Research the power rule as well
Derive x to the n equals n times x to the n minus 1
Derive x to the n equals n times x to the n minus one
Write it out see what it's all about
End of day that's what gives you clout
Dramatic!
The procedure of the formula is 101
Derivative is simply the rate of change of a quantity
Use the product rule and then the quotient rule too
F of x g d of x sum with g d of f
F of x g d of x sum with g d of f
Df over g is gdf minus fdg all over gg
Quotient rule
Df over g is gdf minus fdG all over gg
Wow!
Remember chain rule (look that one up)
Research the power rule as well
To wrap x to the n equals n times x to the n minus 1
Derive x to the n equals n times x to the n minus 1
Derive it out see what it's all about
In the day that's what you do out
Jammatics
Calculus
