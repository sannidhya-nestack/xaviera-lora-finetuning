Yeah, we don't know say on this journey called life
Might lose some money, might lose some friends
But above all, make sure say don't lose yourself
Watch this, I miss the old me
No matter what them tryna negative can't hold me
I'm taking back my life now, I'm in control of me
And I should have listened to what mama told me
Now I miss the old me (speak quiet)
Have you ever been blessed?
Why you still stress?
Doing better but you still can't invest
So you lose interest then you're in dress
All the bad mind negative mindset
Don't fret, I saw the thing set
The next days ahead are the best ones yet, girl let
Nobody make you feel like less
A Russian tripper claim you are the greatest
I been through so many tests
Now me walk with purpose in every step
No second guess
Cause the one who said dem a real dem a the fakers
That's why me big up me own chest
Now I miss the old me
No matter what dem try no negative they a hold me
I'm taking back my life now I'm in control of me
And I shoulda listen to what mama told me
Now I miss the old me
Me dream big like a skyscraper
Them say have patience but we a no waiter
Or no doctor, go like an actor
Make moves, collect the paper
Rush the haters off me like this
Think up on me real friend who never would switch
Stage up in hits like we just can't miss
Cause we are the champion and never should this
Call me what you wish, still we nah go call it quits
Cause the music make people jump and twist
Them a try a thing but I was born for this
When me tune drop ya girl I say that's my shit
It's Paul to the Anthony and let's face it
Everybody won't like me
But when I touch the mic I shine so brightly
I don't know anybody like me
I miss the old me
No matter when dem tryna negative ya old me
I'm taking back my life now, I'm in control of me
And I shoulda listened to what mama told me
Now I miss the old me, yeah I miss the old me
No matter what them tryna negative can't hold me
I'm taking back my life now, I'm in control of me
And I shoulda listened to what mama told me
Now I miss the old me
