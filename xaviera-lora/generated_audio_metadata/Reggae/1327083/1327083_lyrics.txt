Me love it when you hot, me love it when you cold
Your side eye me fit but me ball like gold
You give me that sweet wine, me feel freaky freaky
Freakin' for the rhythm, me take we body sneaky
Ooh, me need you somebody
Though we take it to the sky
Only you own this party, yeah
Ooh, me need you so sunchy
When we walk it slow too fast
You and me from the past (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
One last time, one more day
One last time, one more day
One last time, one more day
No I ain't like the river, I may grind like the tide
Vibin' marks and I gone hide tonight
Touch me any place, make any time
Every night we'll make the stars red light
Don't cry, my ring cannot wait no more
I'm just a love from the king, I ride no more
I know I'm tied to you, bring me where the stars draw
You wanna see what this swag should go out show?
Ooh, they need you somebody
When we take it to the sky, only on this party, yeah
Ooh, the need is so, so cheap
But we walkin' slow too fast
Young before the blast
Hey, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Lights down low, let the sparks glow
Item take control, time freeze but the heat still grow
This connection for you
Fallen timelines before but your heart rise
I'm inside as before, put your arms around me
Party all night, yeah, we're on a ride, yeah
Light and light, we're holding tight, yeah
I'm in for you, I'm in for you
We make love to the drum
