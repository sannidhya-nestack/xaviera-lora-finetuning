When you hold me in your arms and you fill me with your love
I'll be here for one day, show you what I need
Thinking of you almost every day
Hoping you travel my way, cheeky little face like hers
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
La la la la la la
Boobity boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop
You make me come up, so I'll never come down
You make me come up, and I won't come down
You make me come up, so I'll never come down
You make me come up, and I won't come down
You make me come up, so I'll never come down
You make me come up and I'm not coming down
All of a sudden I hear the drums
Make my heart go boom boom boom
It makes my heart go boom boom boom
You're a little bit special, aren't you?
You're making me hot now, I can tell you
A little special
You make me come up, so I never come down
You make me come up, and I won't come down
You make me come up, so I never come down
You make me come up, and I'm not coming down
'Cause boom boom boom
