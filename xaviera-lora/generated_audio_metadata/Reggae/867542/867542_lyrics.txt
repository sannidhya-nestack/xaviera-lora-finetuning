When you wake up in the morning
No stress
Feel no stress
Before you wind down in the starlight
No stress
Feel no stress
I know sometimes things just don't go your way
K .O. yourself and it won't be okay
Live for tomorrow and start by loving today
I know sometimes things just don't go your way
K .O. yourself and it won't be okay
Live for tomorrow and start by loving today
So take control now and take it slow
Or crash and burn, crash and burn, crash and burn, yeah, you'll crash and burn (burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn)
So take control
Make sure you slow down
Or crash and burn, crash and burn, crash and burn
Yeah, you'll crash and burn
When you hate life on a Monday
No stress
Feel no stress
Paid your bills now you're out of money
No stress
Feel no stress
I know sometimes things just don't go your way
K .O yourself and it won't be okay
Live for tomorrow and start by loving today
I know sometimes things just don't go your way
K .O yourself and it won't be okay
Live for tomorrow and start by loving today
So take control now
And take it slow now
Or crash and burn, crash and burn, crash and burn
Yeah, you'll crash and burn
So take control now
Make sure you slow down
Or crash and burn, crash and burn, crash and burn
Yeah, you'll crash and burn
