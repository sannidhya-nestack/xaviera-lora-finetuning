Who knows about tomorrow, make it my own day
I create a world of color, this is how we play
If you see the beauty in life
There is no surprise
When you open up your eyes
It's the art of you
The art of you
The art of you
Art of you
It's the art of you
Art of you
You're a work of art (you're a work of art)
Of you (art of you)
Make it what you want
Make it up as I go along
Make it up as I go along
Make it up as I go along
The art of you
