Yeah, break it down and start singing
Love wash over me like the morning rain
In your glory set me free again
Love wash over me wash away my pain
And this jealousy
Let us love again
Aye aye I tell you no lying
Jah cannot be pleased with what he sees (oh no)
Rubbing on lies the people crying
No one wants to fight to be free (don't do it)
Rastafari is high in the sky
There will never be equality
Rastafari, we cannot be free
Ruled by Babylon, conspiracy
Rastafari, aye, aye, imprisoned Jah
Rastafari, aye, aye, imprisoned Jah
Aye, aye, see in treachery
We'll get us where we want to be
One love
We want to have a world of peace, deceit and greed
We'll have to cease, leave vacation
Love wash over me like the morning rain
In your glory set me free again
Love wash over me wash away my pain
End this jealousy
Let us love again
Aye aye, I tell you don't lie
Y'all cannot be pleased with our greed
Number one
Numbin' on lies, the people cryin'
No one wants to fight to be free
Roast her for all right
There's pie in the sky
there will never be equality
Roast her for all right
We cannot be free
Ruled by Babylon can spit a seed
Roast her for all right
Aye aye imprisoned Jah
Roast her for all right
Aye aye imprisoned Jah
Aye aye
Hurry, hurry, hurry
Hurry, hurry, hurry
