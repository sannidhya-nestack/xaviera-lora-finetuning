I knew this little boy, he hung out on the streets
If you ever saw his face, you woulda say him did sweet
He had to hustle for his money
He had to hustle for his food
And one day he got mixed up
They said he did murder
Black boy on the corner
Them say he wanted fi murder
In my fi struggle
To be free
Black boy on the corner
Dem say em wanted fi murder
It might fi struggle
To be free
They locked him up for weeks
And weeks then turned to months
You see em never have no parents
To fight for his innocence
I haven't seen him since that day
They pulled him out from the streets
I pray to God he's okay
I hope he is free
Black boy on the corner
Dem say em want it fi murder (want it fi murder)
Em want it fi struggle (em want it fi struggle)
To be free (to be free)
Black boy on the corner
