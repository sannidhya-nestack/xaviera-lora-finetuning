Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh
I said when we come through, we come through with the fire
We cannot go down, only we can go higher
If ever you et, we can surely remind ya
But we got no time to be playing any games
Because when we come through, we come through with the fire
We cannot go down, only we can go higher
If ever you et, we can surely remind ya
But we got no time to be playing any games
Because we on tonight
You see we represent this way
Walking and we talking and we ride this way
Never looking for no trouble or fight
But if trouble come through you know we gonna end it right
Well nobody knows how we like to get it on
They think they can get it on
But I can't'cause we keep it moving on
Sometimes we like to slow it down
But we never let it stop
I said when we come through, we come through with the fire
We cannot go down, only we can go higher
If ever you et, we can surely remind ya
But we got no time to be playing any games
Because when we come through, we come through with the fire
We cannot go down only we can go higher
If ever you et we can surely remind ya
But we got no time to be playing any games
Because we on tonight

But you know when the beat go, yo, we gon' get down (we gon' get down)
The ladies, yo, they like my style
And when they push up close and you know that I break it down (nobody knows)
I would like to get it on
They think they getting close
But they can't cause we keep it moving on
Sometimes we like to slow it down
But we never let it stop

We cannot go down only we can go higher
If ever you et we can surely remind ya
But we got no time to be playing any games
