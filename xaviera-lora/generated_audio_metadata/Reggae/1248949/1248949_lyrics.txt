Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
In the summer out here, the fool
We be jammin' on the shore
With the sun so bright
We feelin' alive and sure
Everything was irie
The vibes them so sweet
Memories of love
Memories of the heat
Summertime dancing in the floor
I refuse to go
Dancing to the reggae beat
Memories to know
Oh, oh, what a time
Oh, oh, what a summer
Never etting
No, never ever more
Under the coconut tree
Skankin' to the reggae melody
Sipping on some ramen ones
Feeling so free
The party never stops
The laughter never ends
Oh, what a time when my family and the friends
Summertime, that's it, 84
Iron feet is gold
Dancing to the reggae beat
Memories to your heart
Oh, what a time
Oh, oh, what a summer
Never etting
Though never of the heart
Love, love and unity
The essence of the season
Blessed by the moon sky
Everything we reason
The memories of'84
The summer so fine
You know my heart and soul
They'll forever shine
Summertime vibes in'84
Iron feelings glow
Dancing to the reggae beat
Memories to a go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o
I love the summer
Never et it
No never ever more
Inna di year 84
The summer vibe so sweet
Holding on to the memories
Never skip a beat
Iron times and iron memories
Forevermore
Inna mi heart inna mi soul
Memories of 84 encore
Oh, oh, what a time
Oh, oh, what a summer
Never et it
No, never remember
In the middle of'84, the summer vibes so sweet
Holding on to the memories, never skip a beat
I read times and I read memories forevermore
In the middle of the heart, in the middle of the soul, memories of'84 are my code
In ugly, in love
Innocence of the season
Passed by the moorside
Everything we reasoned
The memories I feared before
The summer so fine
In love my heart and soul
Yeah, forever shine
I'm fervently up here for
This summer vibe so sweet
