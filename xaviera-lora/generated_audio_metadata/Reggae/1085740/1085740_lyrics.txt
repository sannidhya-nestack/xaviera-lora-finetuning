It's Toptop production
Ayy
Jamaica, Jamaica
It's where I'm at
Ayy, I ain't no fake in it
That's for real
I need a real, real emperor
Right in my lap
You're beautiful, it's all that you got
Takes more than that to last through this life
I'm wild and I'm hungry
And I need more than a pretty face
I need more than a pretty face
I need more than a pretty face
I need more than a pretty face
Surrounded by your whole crew
You think it's so cool, you think it's so cool
Surrounded by your whole crew
You think it's so cool, you think it so cool
Tryna be, I tryna be so fly
But I need more than a pretty face
Tryna be, I tryna be so fly
But I need more than a pretty face
I need more than a pretty face
I need more than a pretty face
I need more than a pretty face
So doot doot doot doot doot doot chop it up
I need more than licks the corn
I really need a girl who can perform
Step up in the place where my friend live on
If been a really lethargic girl let me tell him I'm gone
I need a girl who can keep my time
I need a girl who can keep my shine
I don't need a girl who only can whine
My girl have to sleep and find
This girl in the club every night say she want to turn around
It's not my type
Girl where I go, she just freak and bite me, I tell her that girl is a eat and die
My girl love feel really outrageous, I look for a girl with status
And if she's not famous, I and she could really never make up
When you come up with the pretty little face and you're gonna come up with the silly little face
And I swear some of you feel the silly little face but the looks of the rest of them don't feel the little face
I need more than a pretty face
I need more than a pretty face
I need more than a pretty face
I need more than a pretty face
Surrounded by your whole crew
You think you're so cool
You think you're so cool
Surrounded by your whole crew
You think you're so cool
You think you're so cool
Tryna be, tryna be, tryna be so fly
But I need more than a pretty face
Tryna be, tryna be, tryna be so fly
But I need more than a pretty face
I need more than a pretty face
I need more than a pretty face
You got that pretty face
Gonna hit you up with some dirty fakes
Take you out to outer space
I need more than a pretty face
I need more than a pretty face
