What I'm wanting is a love, yeah
Sweet, sweet love
Love, oh yeah
Sweet, sweet love
She's got a little bit of, a little bit of
Look how she drives me crazy
I wanna feel her body next to mine
With every little movement, every little motion
This girl is oh so freaky
And I know it's the time
ooh, I really want to love her
And ooh, I really want to show her how much I gain
Ooh, yeah, every day, yeah, yeah, yeah
What I'm wanting is her love, yeah, sweet, sweet love
Love, oh yeah, sweet, sweet love
When I knocked out my head I was moving in time
My heart was on the line now
I wanna be her shiny knight
With every step closer, every step to her
My pulse is racing faster
And I know it's a crime
ooh, I really want to love her
And ooh, I really want to show her how much I care
Ooh yeah, everyday, yeah, yeah, yeah
What I'm wanting is her love, yeah, sweet sweet love
Love, oh yeah, sweet, sweet love
'Cause, ooh, I really want to love her
Ooh, I really want to show her how much I care
Ooh, yeah, every day, yeah, yeah, yeah
What I'm wanting is her love, yeah, sweet, sweet love
No, oh, yeah, sweet, sweet love
What I want is a love, yeah, sweet, sweet love
No, oh, yeah, sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love, yeah
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love, yeah
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love, yeah
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
