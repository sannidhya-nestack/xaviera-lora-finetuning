You know it's a thin line between day and night
Also a thin line between love and hate
You know the same heart that said I love you
Is the same heart that said I hate you so bad
And that is so bad
Love will never end, only if you could see my friends
Love will never end, only if you believe my friends
Love will never end, only if you could see my friends
Love will never end, only if you believe my friend
I love the valleys, I love the mountains
I love the rock and I love the trees
I love the rivers and I love the seas
I love the bird that fly them and the fish that in the seas
I love my mommy and I love my daddy
I love my sisters and I love my brothers
I love my uncle and I love my auntie
I love my first cousin and my second cousin because
Love will never end, only if you could see my friends
Love will never end, only if you believe my friends
Love will never end, only if you could see my friends
Love will never end, only if you believe my friends
I get hurt by love so many times before
I feel like fi erase it and put hate trees
But love keeps tearing in my face
How could I ever do a thing like that
When I'm down and out love take me in
And when I'm low love lift me up
When I'm broken hearted love mend my heart
And when me no have no money love is always there
Love never love me out it never share me out
Love always stick around
When my friend leave me out my love always there
So I cannot erase this love from my heart
From this love I will never ever part
Oh God me a love see them and have a talk
Even when I'm an inna the dark
Love will never end, only if you could see my friends
Love will never end, only if you believe my friends
Love will never end, only if you believe my friends
Love will never end, only if you could see my friends
When she look into my eyes, I saw love
When she smile at me, I saw love
When she cook my meal, I saw love
She put the food upon my table, I saw love
When she walk into my room, I saw love
So how can I et about love
Even when love try to put me down
Love will never end, only if you could see my friends
Love will never end, only if you believe my friends
Love will never end, only if you could see my friends
Love will never end, only if you believe my friends
Love will never end
