What else can I say when I see you
I gotta know your name I just need to
You got me thinking crazy in my head now
I got to express a feeling I don't know how
Baby come closer
Whisper in your ear I can't wait not any longer
Baby have no fear
I'm just gonna keep proceeding with these actions
Until you understand the question that I'm asking
You feel me?
Turn on all the lights look into my eyes
You can see what I see
Baby girl come try me if you really want to
All your dreams will come true
Girl you're so enticing
Struck me like some lightning
I'm being real with you baby girl
So come and tell me if you want to
All your dreams will come true
The sparkle in your eye makes me come alive
I ain't gonna lie
I'm just gonna try to make you smile, girl
when it comes to good lovin'
I'll give you somethin' and that's more of that comin'
you know it ain't nothin'
It ain't nothin' to me'cause I wanna be with you
So the question I ask is what you gonna do
A piece of heart like you
So beautiful too
Let me make you my boo
Yeah, I just can't help it anymore
Cause you the shorty that I adore forevermore
I'm just speaking the truth
Speak in my heart that's all
Baby girl come with me and I'll show you how I roll
Turn on all the lights look into my eyes
You can see what I see
Baby girl come try me if you really want to
All your dreams will come true
Girl you're so enticing, struck me like some lightning
I'm being real with you baby girl so come and tell me if you want to
All your dreams will come true
