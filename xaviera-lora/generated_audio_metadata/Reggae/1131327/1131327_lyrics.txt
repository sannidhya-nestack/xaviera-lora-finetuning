Love ya music, love ya music, love ya music, love ya music
If you call him up
If you love him, rub him
Don't bond them up
When they shove him, dub him
Kiss me rough and phone from my central watch you rough and can't hide the feeling
Make me trim and it happen
Make me trim and it happen
Call him up if you love him
Hail him up if you want him
Then don’t bun them up if one dashed him
Don’t break him up
Wanna get up on your level
You better be the devil
Time for round seven
The flyway go heaven
Just like the twelfth and never
Love eternally forever
We’ll always be together
Always be together
Don’t bun them down
Nuff a feel like a lesser man
Let me keep my chrome
So I do better with the next one
Kiss my rough and phone from Boston
Show what you're off and got a high D feeling
Make my chimney happen
Make my chimney happen
Marry up your qualities if you show them spirituality
Be my totem ive me if I'm mistaken
Me say sorry your point taken
If you leave him alone you won't find him at home
I got touch the road with no way fi roam
My gal just, my gal just, my gal just pick up the phone
Initiate the call, if you call him up
If you love him, rub him, don't bond him up
When you shove him, dub him, kiss more often
Phone from Boston, show what you're off and can't hide the feeling
Make me trim and it happen
Make me trim and it happen
Come on, do it for ya
Call him up if you love him
Hail him up if you want him
Then don't bun them up if one dashed him
Don't break him heart
Get up on your level and you better be the devil
Time for round seven, let fly we go heaven
Just like the 12th of never, love eternally forever
We'll always be together, always be together
If you call him up
If you love him, rub him
Don't bond them up
When you shove him, dub him
Kiss more often
Phone from Boston
Show what you're raffin'
Can't hide the feeling
But you're trippin' when it happen
But you're trippin' when it happen
Call him up if you love him
Hail him up if you want him
Then don't bond them up
If one dashed him, what?
(Honesty is the best policy)
If you leave him alone, you won't find him at home
Remember, touch the road with no fear of him roaming
My gal just, my gal just, my gal just pick up his phone
