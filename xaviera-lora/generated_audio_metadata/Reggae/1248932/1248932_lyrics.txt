Sunshine on my face
Waves call out my name
Rhythms here to chase
Life will never be the same
Feel that ocean breeze
Jamaica in my soul
Dancing with the trees
Let the good times roll
I wanna be the king
Of the Caribbean
Living like a dream on the island sea
Sand beneath my feet, music in the air
Reggae heartbeat takes away my care
I wanna be the king of the Caribbean
Living like a dream on the island sea
Moonlight on the sea, stars that shine so bright
Echoes set me free in the tropical night
I wanna be the king of Caribbean
Living like a dream on the island sea
