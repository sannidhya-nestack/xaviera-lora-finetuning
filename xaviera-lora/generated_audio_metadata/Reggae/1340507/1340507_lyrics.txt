Hit the aims in the mind
Think about what you wanna do
Focus your vision on success
Make your plans
Do your best
And Jah will do the rest
Yes, we can do it
Let's do it
We can do it if we put our minds to it
We can do it
Let's do it
We can do it if we put our minds to it
Sometimes you feel like
You can't go on
But remember
You've got a plan
Keep on doing what you do
Jah will guide you through
On a mission
Don't back down no now
We can do it
Let's do it (do it, do it)
We can do it if we put our minds to it
We can do it
Let's do it (do it, do it, do it)
We can do it if we put our minds to it
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Yeah yeah
We can do it
Let's do it
We can do it if we put our minds to it
We can do it
Let's do it
We can do it if we put our minds to it
Life throws us
Test and trials
We up against your rivals
Some will try to stop you from getting ahead
Don't deviate
Hold your head high
We can do it
Let's do it
We can do it if we put our minds to it
We can do it
Let's do it
We can do it if we put our minds to it
We can do it
Let's do it, we can do it if we put our minds to it
We can do it, let's do it, we can do it if we put our minds to it
