I need to think of a reason
So that I can take you home today
You see my girl is coming home
I'm just hoping the plane ain't delayed
I guess having patience
Is just something that I've always lacked
I guess there's no more waiting
I'm excited that she's coming back
She says she's coming home
I hope she's gonna stay
Because she's coming home
Please Mr. Mothman don't you make me wait
I ain't got no vacation
And my sick days are all used up
I can't have no more uncles die
Cause I just buried one landmine
My mind has been clicking
Ever since she called last night
Saying she be coming home today
On the morning flight she said she coming home
I hope she gonna stay
Because she coming home
Please Mr. Boss man don't you make me wait
I know I just took off yesterday
And that is gonna have a fit
But if I can't get away
I guess I'm gonna call it quits
Because she coming home
I know she gonna stay
Because she coming home
Please Mr. Vaughn man don't you make me wait
Because she coming home
I know she gonna stay (gonna stay) because she coming home (coming home)
Please miserable man know you make me wait, oh
Coming home
I know, I know (gonna stay) she here to stay (coming home) please
Coming home
Gonna stay
Comin' home
Comin' home
I'm gonna say
Comin' home
Comin' home
I'm gonna say
Comin' home
Coming home, coming home, coming home, coming home, coming home
I'm gonna see you coming home
