Yeah, you know sometimes in life you gotta lose everything to find yourself
I've been doing a lot of searching and I feel like, it's like I'm back, you know
Aye, new and improve, let's go, I love the new me
Not for them can try but they'll never outdo me
I took back my life and now I keep it true to me
And I'm listening to how my mama school me
Yeah I love the new me (Sweet Vines)
I went from depressed to blessed
Giving it my best
You'll never get ahead if you don't take a step to the left
Right, left, right, left
Man a real reggae soldier to death
Self improvement
It's a movement
Care for your mind before you lose it
Life we're given
We can't choose it
So it's all about what we do with it
You'll never get the best of me
Switch up the pattern flip it back on my enemies
By any means necessary I must shine
It's my time
Fast forward no rewind
I love the new me
Nuff a dem can try but they never outdo me
I took back my life and now dem can't get through to me
And I'm listening to how my mama school me
Yeah I love the new me
Dunno say I been on this journey for a long time you know what I mean
And I gotta love everything I gotta embrace each and every part of this journey
From the darkest days to the best days
Want to say one love to each and every one of my family and friend
Them out there who supported me along the way
Who wanted to see me win
I give thanks for you
And big up all the people out there who never want to see me win
Y'all made me want to win even more
Nothing can't stop me
Nothing can't flap me
I'm moving forward, strong
Light after dark, it's time to shine
Let's go! I love the new me
Nuff a dem can try but they never outdo me
I took back my life and now I keep it true to me
And I'm listening to how my mama school me
Yeah I love the new me, I love the new me
Nuff a dem can try but they never out do me
I took back my life and now dem can't get through to me
And I'm listening to all my mama school me
I love the new me
