We live in a world where people say they're looking for a future
We live in a dream of knowing we've got to get together
Solidarity is the way we should spend the time
Hand in hand we'll be complete, no loss, no crime
We always recognize the truth within our eyes
And with this gathering we'll know the way
Look out and you will see
Just what was meant to be
It's written in the stars to guide our way
we've got to do what's right
We've got to win the fight
It's got to be you and me
For the future still holds the key for this unity
Unity
This unity
Unity, yeah, yeah
We live when we learn the fire burns
Confined illusions
We're looking for a reason to feel alright
Tonight, that's right, yeah
We're reaching so deep inside for questions of the heart
And with positive motion, that's the answer to make us start
We always recognize the truth within our eyes
And with his guiding hand we'll know the way
Look out and you will see
Just what was meant to be
It's written in the stars to guide our way
Oh,'cause we've got to do what's right
We've got to win the fight
It's got to be you and me
For the future still holds the key for this unity
This unity
This unity
Oh oh this unity
For the children

For the children
It's for the children
