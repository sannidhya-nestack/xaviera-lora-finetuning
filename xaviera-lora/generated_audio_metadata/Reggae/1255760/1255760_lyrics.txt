Get a green rope, tie it up a lot
Do it all alone, is it good? I'm afraid not
Draw a little string, make the telephone ring
Let it sing, let it ding-ding, make a little bling
Gotta make connect, protect the neck
I care, you care, we all care about the rest
This is a test, you're not the best until you
Weave together, make believe together
You can upset the weather, put the screws to leather
And then the whole damn crew knows the world is better
When we twist up a strong rope, bind to hope
And be one world, one heart
Stronger together than we are apart
We're too rich and strong together
We're as strong when we tether
It's amazing and it's crazy when we come together, baby
We're so strong together, we belong in the center
If you wanna make it green then come along and jump on
Doubling down on the revolution, lining the sand
Stick it to the manual, you do what you can
Even if you have to, ragey crazy, keep me cagey
Wait, weep, do what you need to
Don't sleep, wear what you bleed through
You can be what you want to
And even if you can't, you can love what you've been through
Everybody wanna get together, we can do a little better
If we bind up, fill up your mind cup
Tie the string together, grow the scope
We're stronger when together, we're rising strong
We're strong together, we're as strong when we tether
It's amazing and it's crazy when we come together, baby
We're so strong together, we belong in the center
If you wanna make it green then come along and jump on
Strong together, strong together
We're too strong together
We're as strong when we tether
It's amazing and it's crazy when we come together baby
We're so strong together
We belong in the center
If you wanna make it green then come along and jump on
Go, go, go, go, go, yeah, yeah, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, yeah
Together we're so strong together we're a strong when we tether
It's amazing and it's crazy when we come together baby
We're so strong together we belong in the center
If you wanna make it green then come along and jump on
