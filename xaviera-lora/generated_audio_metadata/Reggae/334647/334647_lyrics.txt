We all the pretty girls in them
Who want to come on my yard for curiosity
You take what you get and you get what you take
For curiosity kills the can, ha ha ha hey, ah
Me not call them but them come
Me not call them but them come
Me not call them but them come
Come on my yard for curiosity
Me not call them but them come
Men a call dem, but dem come
Men a call dem, but dem come
I'm on my yard for curiosity
I'm not a man to get easily furious
There's certain things that I gotta take serious
Getting in the mob is tell me you're curious
Do what I do but I'm not scandalous
Why you are so damn outrageous
Telling all your friends they sold me jeepers
Come on my yard me make you delirious
So now I'm not anonymous
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck curiosity
Why do you think you need a part of me
Told your friends and them you spending night with me
Then fuck you, fuck curiosity
Don't know why you have to mention me
Fuck curiosity kills the cat
I'm not a pussy I'm a big bad dog
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck curiosity
May not call them but them come may not call them
But dem come
Me na call dem
But dem come
Om om my yard for curiosity
Me na call dem
But dem come
Me na call dem
But dem come
Me na call dem
But dem come
Om om my yard for curiosity
