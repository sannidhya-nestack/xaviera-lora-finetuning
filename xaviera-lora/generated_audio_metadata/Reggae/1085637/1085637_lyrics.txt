Can be no badman, can be no gangster
Can be no murderer, can be no follower
No wife beater, no child molester
Can be a cheater, watch this
Got to be a leader, point and steeder
Blaze up the fire, tell satan no come in here
Can kill you, call you them of the future
Yo yo yo yo yo

Them say badness out of style, me ask the question, was it ever in style?

You a run down with a long gun and long knife
Can't blow a break but you want it like
Live by the gun, by the gun you can't die
Anytime you die inna endless where I go
Pick up the bible, put down the nine
Take off your screw face, put on a smile
Badness was never in style and limited against her
Dem seh bandis otah style me ask the question
What is ever in style?
Dem seh bandis otah style me ask the question
What is ever in style?
Dem seh bandis otah style me ask the question
What is ever in style?
Dem seh bandis otah style me ask question
What is ever in style?
Put on the weapon and pick up the Bible
Anything you want, He will give you
Seek Him first and the Bible will impart you
Or you get mixed up, fight and argue
Don't fall on your knees, ask Jesus for pardon
He will give you mercy and will ive you
Eternal life, He will give you
So I'ma sing again
There's a badness out of time, you have to press again
Was it ever in style?
Them say badness out of style me ask the question
Was it ever in style?
Them say badness out of style me ask the question
Was it ever in style?
Them say badness out of style me ask the questions
Was it ever in style?
