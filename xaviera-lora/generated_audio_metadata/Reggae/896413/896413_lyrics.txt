Wonderful life
Wonderful life
You know I won't give you up
There's a big part of you inside of me
You're all I need
But can't you see
How could I ever ever ever say goodbye
When all my world revolved around you
You're all I need
To help me through
there's a wonderful light
Ahead for me and you
Let's take it
Let's think twice
Let's not make no rash decision
It's our life
Together we can have
The whole world dancing around
At our feet if we lie
I saw you standing there love at first sight
But that day all my feelings grow
They call out me
Heart and soul
there's a wonderful life
Ahead for me and you
Let's take it last thing twice
Let's not make no rash decision
It's our life
Together we can have the whole world dancing around
At our feet if we like
So I'm falling down
'Cause there's a wonderful life
There for me and you
Let's take it
Let's think twice
Let's not make no rash decision
It's our life
Together we can have the whole world dancing around
At our feet if we like
You know I won't give you up
There's a big part of you inside of me
You're all I need, can't you see?
there's a wonderful light ahead for me and you
Let's take it, let's think twice
Let's not make no rash decision, it's our life
Together we can have the whole world dancing around
And I'll feel alive, wonderful life
Wonderful life
Wonderful life
Wonderful life
Wonderful life
Wonderful life
Wonderful life
Wonderful life
Wonderful life
Wonderful life
Wonderful life
Wonderful life

Wonderful life
One for life, one for love
