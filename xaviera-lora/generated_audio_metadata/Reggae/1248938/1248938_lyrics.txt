Underneath the moonlight we feel like revised
Everything is nice, no need to hide
With the reggae music we start to glide
Dancing in the moonlight
Feeling so alive
Moonlight's gone
We now hold back
Move and groove
No time for slack
Inna the moonlight
We rock and shock
Feel the rhythm
It don't stop
Stars a shine bright
Inna the dark sky
We come together
Feels so high
If we're on the same
We feel so free
Dancing to the rhythm
Just you and me
Moonlight's gang, we now hold back
Move and groove, no time for slack
Inna di moonlight we rock and shock
Feel the rhythm, hit no stop
Feel the bassline, feel the melody
Moonlight dancing in perfect harmony
No worries, no stress, just pure bliss
Inna di moonlight we find happiness
Moonlight's can't, we no hold back
Move and groove, no time to stop
Inna di moonlight we rock and shop
Feel the rhythm, it no stop
Moonlight's can't, to the break of dawn
This feeling we could never show
Underneath the moonlight we feel alright
Moonlight's gone dancing through the night
Moonlight scan to the break of dawn
This feeling we could never show
Underneath the moonlight we feel alright
Moonlight scan dancing through the night
