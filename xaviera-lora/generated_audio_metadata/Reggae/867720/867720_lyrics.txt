We walked hand in hand in the sand
On the beach we built castles reached to the sky
You're my little reflection on my affection
You know you are my life
I hold a picture of you
My pride and joy
You're making me so damn proud
And when I leave in the morning
I'm really mourning
Thinking'bout you all day long
Ooh, yeah, yeah
I just wanna come home and kiss ya
And squeeze ya and never miss ya
Ooh yeah yeah
I just wanna come home
Never et
Who's your daddy now
Who's your daddy now
Who's your daddy now
I put you up on my shoulder
I just wanna hold ya
You never know what you mean to me
We've tried so hard to conceive you
We finally received you
And now you made my life complete
I felt your little heart kickin'
I made sure nothing was missin'
I counted all the toes in your feet
But then out of the blue she's not the person I knew
And now my love became a chess match over you (ooh yeah yeah)
Ooh yeah yeah (I just wanna come home)
I just wanna come home (I just wanna come home)
Ooh, yeah, yeah (ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I just wanna come home (I just wanna come home)
I just wanna come home
Ooh, yeah, yeah (ooh, yeah)
I just wanna come home (I just wanna come home)
I never would give
Who's your daddy now?
Oh no
Who's your daddy now?
Who's your daddy now?
You don't play my kid like a fiddle
You don't put him in the middle
Because you're so vindictive and you're so unkind
Hey judge, don't ignore me
I'm useless, spoken softly
He got my back to the wall and I'm gonna stand tall and fight for what is mine
Hey judge, show me affection
Take the order of protection
And you can tell that creep
She can fight it real deep where the sun don't shine
I would die for my country
Kill for my baby
Don't make me crazy
Could justice be so blind?
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah
I just wanna come home
I just wanna come home
I just wanna come home
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I just wanna come home
I just wanna come home now
And never et
Who's your daddy now?
Mama, I love you and I always will
But I'll never ive you'til this stays still
The way you robbed me, you took from me
The man in my life, you wouldn't let me see
Your lies I see so clearly
The way you broken up my happy family
Just because you and him did not get along
Why'd you drag me where I did not belong
You made me believe that my daddy was wrong
But then you only signed on me one side of the song
You deceived me, believe me
You took away a very special part of me
Don't touch me and don't look at me
Don't cry because your tears don't mean a thing to me
And now I just wanna get in my car
Drive it real fast and it's far away from you
I don't know who I am, I don't know where I stand, my head is spinning
I don't know who I am, I don’t know where I stand, my head is spinning
I don't know who I am, I don't know where I stand, my head is spinning
I don't know who I am, I don’t know where I stand, my head is spinning, yeah
I miss my daddy, I miss my daddy
I just wanna come home and kiss ya, and squeeze ya, never miss ya
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
No matter how she fills your empty heart
You'll never et
Who's your daddy now?
