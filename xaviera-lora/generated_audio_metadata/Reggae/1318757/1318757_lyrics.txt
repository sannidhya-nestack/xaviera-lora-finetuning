If you throw a boomerang, don't et to duck
Hanging a horseshoe upside down will bring bad luck
You can do all the right things right and still everything will go wrong
If that happens to you my friend, smile and sing this song
Sometimes you eat the bear
Sometimes the bear eats you
Sometimes you will bite off
More than you can chew
Life is like flipping a coin
Heads you win, tails you lose
Sometimes you eat the bear
Sometimes the bear eats you
There's no need to worry
Be happy all day long
Look adversity in the face
Smile and sing this song
Sometimes you eat the bear
Sometimes the bear eats you
Sometimes you will bite off
More than you can chew
Life is like flipping a coin
Heads you win, tails you lose
Sometimes you eat the bear
Sometimes the bear eats you
Life is like flipping a coin
Heads you win, tails you lose
Sometimes you eat the bear
Sometimes the bear eats you
