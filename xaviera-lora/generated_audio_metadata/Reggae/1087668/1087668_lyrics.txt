But I don't want you coming to this life and come to one like you're too bad my yo (too bad)
Because everything too bad get cut up (memba dat) the powers (memba dat) whoo
So I have talk want to get on you dem behalf (definitely) yeah (ha)
So mi say fi build
Mi know you got the powers but you don't have the will
Nasekul fit the flat mi have to live on the hill
Nasa hatu waka don't tell life a thrill
Mi go in pe me go all on me natural meal
No confuse your brain because you will get killed
Just work on chakra until your goal fulfilled
Tell Babylon say just please be still
Well di say sugar di eat not jack and Jill

The road is muddy muddy foggy and dark
Give me the light so I and I can walk
Don't want to stumble when I in the dark
Be careful of the wicked ones who love to talk

So long I've been so wrong
Help me to find my way
So long I've been so wrong
I on my knees I pray
So long I've been so wrong
Help me so I can understand
So long I've been so wrong
