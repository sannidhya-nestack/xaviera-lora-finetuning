Whoa, no, no, no, no, no
Montego Bay is the place to stay
With the sunshine and bright every day
The water's so clear, the breeze so sweet
We'll tell you this far can't be pleased
Montego Bay, Montego Bay
We're in a vibe so high, come be safe
From the hills to the shore, everywhere we go
In Montego Bay, that's where we're from
No problem, no worries, just good times
It is paradise, we feel so fine
On the beach, we dance and sing
We're breaking music, play the good vibes clean
Montego Bay, Montego Bay
Where the birds so high, we come, we stay
From the hills to the shore, everywhere we go
In Montego Bay, it's where we from
Oh, oh, oh
So raise your hands and feel your groove
In Montego Bay we're not gonna move
The love and unity is all around
If in this town happiness can be found

We stay from the hills to the shore
Everywhere we go
In Montego Bay, it's where we float
So raise your hands and feel your groove
In Montego Bay, Anakamu, the love, the unity
It's all around, in this town
Happiness can be found, Montego Bay
Montego Bay, where the vibes so high

Everywhere we go, in Montego Bay
Stay with your home
Montego Bay, replace the beat
This tropical haven, we feel so free
So come along, let's make memories
In Montego Bay, where the spirits interweave
Oh, oh
