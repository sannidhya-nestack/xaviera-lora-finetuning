Charlie, oh Charlie
Charlie, you are a rock to me
Charlie, you still are you see
I remember the very first night
You were dancing to the warmest of white
You were moving, bouncing to the beat
You were looking and smiling oh so sweet
Now you're an angel in the big blue sky
Beautiful angel, I didn't wanna say goodbye
You're an angel in the grey sky above
A beautiful angel in this song I send my love
I recall it was your birthday
I know you well, you always got your way
You were playing on Christmas day
I was hopeless but you showed me the way
Now you're an angel in the big blue sky
Beautiful angel, I didn't want to say goodbye
You're an angel, in the grey sky above
A beautiful angel, in this song I send my love
Hey Charlie, guess what's popped into my mind
You and me filming summertime
Summertime girl was your favorite song
I remember you always sang along
Now you're an angel in the big blue sky
A beautiful angel, I didn't wanna say goodbye
You're an angel in the grey sky above
A beautiful angel, in this song I send my love
Now you're an angel in the big blue sky
A beautiful angel, I didn't wanna say goodbye
You're an angel in the grey sky above
A beautiful angel, in this song I send my love
It was a pleasure just being your friend
No, it was an honor
Your love will be with me through to the end
So Charlie, you were a rock to me
Hey Charlie, you still are, you see
Beautiful angel, beautiful angel
Charlie, oh Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie
Now you're an angel in the big blue sky
Beautiful angel, I didn't want to say goodbye
You're an angel in the grey sky above
A beautiful angel, I'm sending you my love
