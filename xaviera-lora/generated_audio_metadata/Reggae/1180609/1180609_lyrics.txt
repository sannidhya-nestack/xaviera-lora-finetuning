I
Ooh, yeah
Yeah
Eastward bound (Eastward bound)
To find some tranquility
To Africa, the motherland
Eastward bound
To find some tranquility
Leaving Rome
To Africa, the motherland
Tired of the oppression here in our Babylon
Everything you do they say you're wrong
Can't even meditate in your own yard
Life is so hard (so hard)
Everyday it's the same rat race
Everybody running down the dollar (down the dollar)
Working so hard for so little
Can't even pay the cost of living
Eastward bound (eastward bound)
To find some tranquility
To Africa, the motherland
Eastward bound (Eastward bound)
To find some tranquility (Oooh)
Leaving Rome (Leaving Rome)
To Africa, the motherland (Africa)
Yelele mama
Yelele mama
Mama, mama, mama, yeah, oh
More and more pressure every day
As we trying to survive
There seem to be no love for humanity
Just love for the money
No love
I am going to a land where there's a place
For so many
For so many, many
Why should we cram ourselves in big cities
When the land is so plenty
Eastward bound (Eastward bound)
To find some tranquility (Oooh)
Leaving Rome (Leaving Rome)
To Africa, the motherland (Africa)
Eastward bound (Eastward bound)
To find some tranquility (Oooh)
Leaving Rome (leaving Rome)
To Africa, the motherland (Africa)
Yeah, East-Rabban, yeah, East-Rabban
I'm leaving, woo-wee
Africa, here I come
The motherland, here I come
I'ma leave, I'ma leave it here
