We're holding on, we're holding strong
Dem think we woulda gone gone gone no
Aye, it's bloody fake
Dem give the condom say put it by you long dong deh
Population control Babylon dem say
Tsunami gonna probably bomb dem go drop dong deh
Dem no want we rise
Them the one we realize
Give them a surprise
Them are the devil in disguise
No matter how you try
We holding on
We holding strong
Them think we would a disappear
How much price do dem give we in the atmosphere
Dem think we woulda gone gone gone
Dem think we woulda disappear
How much poison dem give we ain't have food fi share
Cause we sit here we trap dem set out there
Don't believe everything what dem a teach out there
Man cause government runs live on
Some more profit to go bond (pro-pro-re-re-re-re-re-re)
Just give me the mic and make me go on sing
Me have to be gone Malcolm X and Luther King
Mandela inna South Africa
Gandhi inna India
We holding on (holding on)
We holding strong
Dem think we would a disappear
How much poison dem give we into atmosphere?
Dem think we woulda gone gone gone
Dem think we woulda disappear
How much poison dem give we inna food fi share
Some may fall but we will never yield
To bond build and system rasta never kneel
Persevere though the hills are steep
Righteousness protect us through the day
Divide and rule is a part of their plan
We'll survive if united we stand
My people hold on
You gots to be strong
We holding on
We holding strong
Dem think we gonna disappear
How much poison dem give we in the atmosphere
Dem think we woulda gone gone gone
Dem think we woulda disappear
Oh mud pies on dem g away inna food
Conspiracy theory child dem set out there
Don't believe everything what dem a teach out there
Dem think we woulda disappear
Dem think we woulda disappear
Dem people woulda gone gone gone oh gosh
