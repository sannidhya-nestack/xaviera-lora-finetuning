Fulfillment of prophecy
The world has come to pass
We're living in perilous times
You better prepare your heart
Jah is the only way
Go on your knees and pray
'Cause He will take you through
And make your life new
Only Jah can take us through
When it really gets rough, really gets tough
Only Jah can take us through
When it really gets rough, really gets tough
Shake out the world today
Just violence and crime
There's so much poverty
Many people suffering
Men think highly of themselves
etting the Creator
The rich oppress the poor
Can't take it anymore
Only Jah can take us through
When it really gets rough, really gets tough
Only Jah can take us through
When it really gets rough, really gets tough
As His Majesty has said
You should read your Bible
In it you will find truth
It is your refuge
So glory to the King
Has opened our minds
You should check out the words
So relevant in this time
Only Jah
Can't take us through
When it really gets rough
Really gets tough
Only Jah
Can't take us through
