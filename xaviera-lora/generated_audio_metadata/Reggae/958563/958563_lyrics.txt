A passage across the ocean, a soul lost at sea
I never would have journeyed if I knew that it could change me
But you can't escape the beauty
It still bewilders me
So you go on looking
For something to set you free, yeah
I'll go on
Just can't seem to fight it, no
I'll go on
Burn to the rhythm that burns in me
A passage to adventure
Still can't find my way
Sky is oh so cloudy
I can't find that sunny day
So I'll go on looking
Hoping there's a way
My heart is where my home is
So I've got to say yeah yeah
I'll go home
I just can't seem to fight it, no
I'll go home
Back to the rhythm that burns in me
I'll go home, I'll go home
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Waiting for tomorrow
It's just another day
To wipe away my sorrow
There's only one way
I'll go on
You see I just can't seem to fight it, yeah, yeah
I'll go, yeah
To the rhythm that burns in me, yeah
I'll go home, I'll go home, I'll go home
Just can't seem, just can't seem to find that ease
I'll go home, oh yeah
Back to the rhythm that burns, rhythm that burns in me, yeah
I'll go home
I just can't seem to find it
