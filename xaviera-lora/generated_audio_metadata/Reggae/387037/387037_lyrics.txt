Well you know it's slam the girl's lantern
Who's without equal when it comes to love and affection
I'm just here to take the girls to a higher dimension
Catch my slam (just take it, just take it, just take it, just take it off now)
Well the girl dem say ya me dem want
So dem invite me to come over
Ya love like saturated and raw
And I move like a love dancer
Fling with niggas and then fling with bra
So mi draw fi mi rough rider
And start to push wood inna fire
From upstairs to downstairs and the cellar
From kitchen to bathroom and the sofa
Girl from UK and America
We no care if you a good as or if you a sloper
The girl dem rate me as the number one lover
Girl I'm so excited and it drive me crazy
My queen my princess much more than a lady
The sweeter than the roses the sweeter than the daisies
No if no but no maybes
Take it off (take it off)
Take it off, take it off now, take it off, take it off, take it off, take it off, take it off, take it off, take it off, take it off, take it off now
London love the smile where you got
Them legs them thighs where you got
That pretty smile where you got
Love that teasing style where you got
Wine to the bottom then you wine to the top
Keep on your boots keep on your hats
Love how you slowly take off your top
And then you turn then you twist then you rock
Oh boy, you drive me crazy
et it, I'm a lady
London and Jerry
One-third boy
Keeping you happy and merry
Too much, too much
Head rush, head rush
I'll spin until you land hard for your toes
Take it off, just, just take it off
Give me boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, give me boom, boom, boom, boom, boom give me that
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom boom, give me boom, boom, boom, because I know
Give me boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, give me boom, boom, boom boom, give me that
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, give me boom, boom, boom because I know
Take it off (take it off) this music (take it off) London dance if you take it off (take it off)
Take it off (take it off) London dance if you take it off (take it off)
Take it off
Blondie, blondie, psyche
Take it off (take it off)
Take it off
London love the smile where you got
Them legs them thighs where you got
That pretty smile where you got
Love that teasing style where you got
Wine to the bottom then you wine to the top
Keep on your boots keep on your hats
Love how you slowly take off your top
And then you turn and it's Christine you rock'em
Take it off, take it off, London's a beat
Take it off, take it off, London's the beat
Take it off, take it off
Blunt on the feet, Dekido
Blunt on the feet, Dekido
Blunt on the feet, Dekido
