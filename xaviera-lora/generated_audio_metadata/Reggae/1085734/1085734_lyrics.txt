One time
Don't know if I'm different with Ivy
You know it's AK Jutoram
A chop chop production studio
Right here in this west west west side
Ready? Yo! Yo! (The Baba man want some high grade, high grade, high grade)
(The Baba man want some high grade, high grade, high grade)
(The Baba man want some high grade, high grade, high grade)
(The Baba man want some high grade, high grade)

I press out the herbs straight like my pant seam
Zeus, I grade you wish you never seen
Me go semi-tachyalli and all fill his team
Burn it, inna a corner me a lean
And the girls dem semi-semi, I inna all jeans

Stars only shine without the herb
When you call me, me no come
Because I love how this herb a blossom
I cut it up and put it in a nature lump
Last time I no smoke it till die king come
But it's a past when the herb me no come
And me a feel like all the herb me no drunk
Little more when all them four me a turn
Checks in tatil men dey get out back, rest a man a pound
High grade, high grade, high grade, dey baba man want some
High grade, high grade, high grade, de baba man want some
High grade, high grade
I agreed, the Bubba man want some
I agreed, I agreed, I agreed, the Bubba man want some
Saw something without the help, how you call me? Me no move, move
With the eyes from police in the shoes
But only with the music, but with the blues
Rasta man a use it when a yacht in the cruise
Hey, excuse me, make me laugh, must click on a beast
Rasta man have everything under control with the pace, release
I agreed, tell me some, I agreed, the Bubba man want some
