There goes my best friend
His name is Gunner and he is my dog
Why won't he come to me when I call?
He sits but he won't shake a paw
He won't roll over but he'll fetch a ball
But why won't he bring it back to me?
Gunna's running round the bend
I think he's got him a new girlfriend
He sure is living high on the hog
Gunna yeah, he's my dog
Woah woah, woah woah, yeah
Everyday we go for a walk
Maybe three times around the block
Man I swear he pees on every tree
That he sees, yeah
Every night again he gets loose
And terrorizes the whole neighborhood
Chases squirrels up and down the trees, yeah
Gunner's running round the bend
I think he found him a new girlfriend
He sure is living high on the home
Gunner, yeah, he's my dog, woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah, he paces back and forth
He'd really like to eat the cat
I wish that I could assure you he won't do that
No, no, he won't do that
No, no, no
Gunner's running round the bend
Think he found him a new girlfriend
He sure is living high on the hog
Gunner yeah yeah he is my dog
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Gunner he is my dog
Whoa whoa whoa whoa yeah
Gunner he is my dog
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
