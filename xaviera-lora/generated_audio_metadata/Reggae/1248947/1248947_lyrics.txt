Morning light fades, day calls us true
Rise up strong, gotta see it through
World turns'round, sky so blue
Come back now, it's up to you
Children play, their joy so bright
In their eyes, they fight for right
Voice so clear, beyond goodnight
Shout it loud, rise up to the light
Stand tall, don't delay
Freedom song, come what may
Hold the line, make them sway
Stand for what's yours today
Dusty roads, the journey long
United hearts, make us strong
Simple tunes, a reggae song
Feel the beat, join the throng
Through the pain the struggle drew
Hearts of gold, skies so blue
Hands held high, me and you
Stand up strong let us fight through
Let stars guide through the night
Hopes of fire burning bright
In the dark there's the light
Stand up tall for what's right
Let stars guide through the night
Host of fire burning bright
In the dark there's the light
Stand up tall for what's right
Let stars guide through the night
Hope's the fire burning bright
In the dark there's a light
Stand up tall for what's right
