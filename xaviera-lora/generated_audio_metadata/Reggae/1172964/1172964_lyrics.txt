Ooh wee, ooh wee
One load argument, broke up inna fight
Miss him kinda measurements, he kicked last night
No kinda patience, quick be accused
I just saw me know the girl rude
But me lover and me can't refute
But me lover and me can't refute
Ooh wee, ooh wee
What kind of thing in this relationship
We got too many holes and messy night
Fill up this pot put love in it
I'm a garden and sense quick
I'm a garden and sense quick
It's complicated
Don't think or make it
I won't say bye bye I just say that
I'll see you in a while
Ooh this is crazy
Told me you hate me
Sorry baby I have nothing more that I can say
What do you want me to say?
It's complicated
Don't think I'll make it
I won't say bye-bye, I'll just say that
I'll see you in a while
