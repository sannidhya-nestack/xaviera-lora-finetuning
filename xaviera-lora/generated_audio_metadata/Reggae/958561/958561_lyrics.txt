Take me back, take me back, oh yeah
Ooh, yeah
Me and the boys were grooving easy
Living it up real Texas style
Round and round on Beltway 8
Covered every single mile
Taking it on to old San Houston
In our red dreams borrowed car
Searching for the nights of music
Hope our songs would get us far
Take me back again
To the place I've been
Will it be the same
Count ups and sweat plays
Making waves with reggae music
Yeah, rocking out in smokey bars
Yeah, shooting pool to pass the night away
Up until the morning stars, yeah
Take me back again (back again)
To the place I've been (place I've been)
Visit all the scenes (all the scenes)
Down on Sands with me
Whoa, backyard reasoning every evening
Lighting up the Texas sky
Kicking ball all day with Wayne
Working on the club dread ride
Mmm yeah
Sing
Dreaming dreams about the big stage
Writing songs on Jay's guitar
Love the feeling when we search the time
Always reaching for the stars
Take me back again
To the place I've been
In the DNA say
Down on Sandswept Lane
Take me back again
To the place I've been
Sit on sand
Down on Sandswept Lane
