Cool down your temperature, you're too hot, you're too hot
Cool down your temperature, you're too hot, you're too hot
They say you're rougher than rough
You're claiming you're tougher than tough
You a war maker
But I'm a peacemaker
Don't pick on me because I look so easy
If your life's an attack I will strike back
Cool down your temperature you're too hot
You're too hot
Cool down your temperature you're too hot
You're too hot
Relaxing at my corner watching you exhaust yourself
You acting like a monster trying to instigate fear
Many big and bad being cut down to size
Stop your foolishness you better get wise
Cool down your temperature you're too hot, you're too hot
Cool down your temperature you're too hot, you're too hot
So hear me now, me now go pow
And listen to you all again
Don't take my style, you get me one
Calm yourself down right now
Don't even come and try me
Don't even try to taste me
Consider this a warning
Listen to what I'm saying
Cool down
Your temperature, you're too hot, you're too hot, cool down
Your temperature, you're too hot, you're too hot, cool down
Your temperature, you're too hot, you're too hot, cool down
Your temperature, you're too hot, you're Too hot, yeah
Cool down your temperature (cool down)
You're too hot, you're too hot, you're too hot, yeah
You're too hot, you're too hot, cool down
You're too hot, you're too hot, cool down
