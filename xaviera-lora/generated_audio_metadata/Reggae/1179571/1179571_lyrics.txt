Why did you go away
Look how I beg you to stay
And baby I'm so lonely
I've been feeling so sad and blue
Since you've been away
Oh I miss you more than I can say
Yeah yeah
Baby I want you
Baby I need you
Baby I want you right now
Baby I want you
Baby I need you
Baby I want you right now
I feel so empty when you're not around me
You mean so much to me
Every day and every night I dream of you
If you don't come back I don't know what I'll do
Baby I want you, baby I need you
Baby I want you right now
Baby I want you, baby I need you
Baby I want you right now
It seems like an eternity
Since you've been away from me
But I love you endlessly
Although it seems so long
My love for you is still very strong
Oh baby, will you come along? Yeah, yeah
Baby I want you, baby I need you
Baby I want you right now
Baby I want you, baby I need you
Baby I want you right now
Baby I want you, baby I need you
Baby I want you right now
Baby I want you, baby I need you
Baby I want you right now
Baby I want you, baby I need you
Baby I want you right now
Baby I want you
