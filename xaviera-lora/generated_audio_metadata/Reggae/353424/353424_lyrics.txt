We've got some time on our hands
Ain't got no money to spend
We've got our day and then
Some time before we love again
Let's take a walk down to the boardwalk
We'll walk along hand in hand
Let's take a walk down to the boardwalk
Shake it to the beat of the band
Oh yeah, we'll go dancing in the sunshine
We'll go dancing in the rain
We'll go dancing in the moonlight
We'll be two step and a night away
The sunshine and we're doing fine
Frozen margaritas keep us dancing in town
Sand on our feet is always a treat
And riding waves on the ocean of love
Get your dancing shoes and come on now
Bob Marley he be jamming up above
And get your dancing shoes and come on now
Band is rocking could you be loved oh yeah
We'll go dancing in the sunshine
We'll go dancing in the rain
We'll go dancing in the moonlight
You'll be two step in the night
Away from it everyday
Dance in the night away
Let the ocean take your breath away
The sun's going down and the music's coming down on me
Down on me
We'll go dancing in the sunshine
We'll go dancing in the rain, yeah, yeah
Dance all night and sleep all day
We'll be two step in the night away
We'll go dancing in sunshine
We'll go dancing in the rain
We'll go dancing in the morning light
You'll be two step in the night away
Away from the everyday dance in the night away
We'll go dancing in the sunshine
Dance all night sleep all day
You'll be two step in the night away
Two step in the night away
Two step in the night away, yeah
Dance in the night away, yeah, yeah, yeah
