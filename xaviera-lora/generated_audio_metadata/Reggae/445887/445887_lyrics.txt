Take one, take two, take three
Check it out now, but don't take the heart of me
Listen to the rhythm, listen to the sound
Leaves me all imprisoned bound
It's only the beginning, not nearly the end
Take it one back and start again
Westbound train with no return
Take a look back and watch it burn
You got it all wrong and it's plain to see
This ain't the place for you or me
Can we start it over again
I just don't know where to begin
Time has come to read it all back
Nothing like you to keep me on track
There ain't no rhyme, there ain't no reason
Just like the line to home if your trees hurt
It's okay, I understand
You don't need anybody holding your hand
You get the left, I'll get the right
Keep this up and I'll make it tonight
You got it all wrong and it's plain to see
This ain't the place for you or me
Can we start it over again
I just don't know where to begin
You've got it all wrong and it's plain to see
This ain't the place for you or me
And we started over again
I just don't know where to begin
Wasting away this life
Never doing anything right
Is it wrong for me to say what I want to say
Spending so much time being so unkind
Is it wrong for me to say
You got it all wrong and it's plain to see
This ain't the place for you or me
And we started over again
I just don't know where to begin
Headin' to the end I can only pretend that it wasn't meant for me
If I start it all over I cannot lie
I'll probably give it another try
Pack it all up and ship it on out
I'm gonna tell you what it's all about
Play it all back one more time
Cue it on through it isn't a crime
