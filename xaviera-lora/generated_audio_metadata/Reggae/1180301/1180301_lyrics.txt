Love in your heart, jog in the soul, come on let the good times roll
Love in your heart, jog in the soul, come on let the good times roll
We don't want no fussing, we don't want no fighting
Say if it all comes canking to the sweet music playing
Come on down and hear this sound, say when you are feeling down
And if you are feeling alright
Just jam and hold tight
Love in your heart, jog in your soul
Come on let the good times roll
Love in your heart, jog in your soul
Come on let the good times roll
No matter what your problems may be
Don't waste precious time to worry
Jah he controls everything
You gotta put your trust in him
Don't drown yourself in sorrow
Don't worry about tomorrow
And this is time to have some fun
Listen to me everyone
Love in your heart, junk in your soul
Come out of the good times, oh
Love in heart, choke in soul
Come on let a good time roll
No matter what anyone say
We a go rock a reggae everyday
So even when the chips a down
We no go stop practice your sound
No matter if you young or old
No matter if you shy or bold
And if you wrong come skanky
To the sweet music play
Love in your heart
Joke in your soul
Come and let the good times roll
Love in your heart, junk in your soul
Come on let the good times roll
Love in your heart, junk in your soul
Come on let the good times roll
Love in your heart, junk in your soul
Come on let the good times roll
Let the good times roll, yeah
Oh yeah, let the good times roll
Come on let the good times roll
Come on let the good times roll
Come on let the good times roll
