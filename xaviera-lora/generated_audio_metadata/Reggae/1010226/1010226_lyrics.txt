Test me boy you gone low
When I drown in sorrow I still flow
Ain't gon' see me choke
Me ain't not worried'bout me, I'ma cope
I ain't talk a weak rap, drink no coke
Talkin'bout God love like my soul
I'm kinda burnin' one down tight flow
Okay now, yeah, I can light you up, didn't know
Duty ready, show you how that racks a flow
I be on my stock, red, yellow, green, gold
If you not standin' with me, I'ma stand solo
And I ain't messin' with shit if you stand so-so
Rank one up out that business, yeah, we move so pro
That's why I tell my mother for the holy ghost bro
Never let the world see a he bro
Enemy never see a he bro
Musa flex like me never born bro
On the L I permit just like so
Can't let the world see a he bro
Enemy never see a hero
Musa flex like me never go and broke
On me head hype and me chase like so
Living on a name can't touch
So dem bad man me inna rush
Some a dem me call friend me can't trust
Backstab a do em dirty inna us
Some girl a vampire pussy and stush
Dem a break man down and break a man clutch
Take a man hard no dem a ve me inna clutch
Dem a vex me when me buck
Test me but me band tough
Noneh meh meh want keep a gun tough
Run up on a boy nah man stuck
Hard boy business ago put a in a cuff
Last time meh want a me fi get lock up
Meh rather get druke up or get pop up
Meh meh money proper so meh never gwap

Rank one Brooklyn pops like what up
Rank one run up in the game like what up
