Inna the summer of'84
We been jammin' on the shore
With the sun so bright
Fulfillin' a life unsure
Everything was irie
The vibes and so sweet
Memories of love
Memories of the heat
Summertime, mines in'84
Every feelings galore
Dancing to the revue beat
Memories to adore
Oh what a time
Oh what a summer
Never etting
Don't ever open war
Under the coconut trees, can't keep to the reggae melody
Sipping on some rum punch, feeling so free
The party never stopped, the laughter never end
Oh all the time with my family and friends
Under the coconut trees, can't keep to the reggae melody
Sipping on some rum punch, feeling so free
The party never stopped
The laughter never end
Oh what a time with
The family and the friends
Summertime rising here for every feeling still low
Dancing to the reggae beat memories to adore
Oh what a time oh what a summer
Never etting you never were
Another cup of cheese, can't seem to remember the love
Sipping on some rum, I'm feeling so free
The party never stopped, the laughter never end
Oh all the time with my family and a friend
Not sure about unity, the essence of the season
Less by the most I, everything with reason
The memories are feeling full
This summer so fine
Inna be heart and soul
Temporary shine
Under the cool palm trees
Helping to remember the love
Sipping on some rum
Always feeling so free
Oh all the time
Oh all the summer
Never etting
No never up above
In every year I feel it fall, this summer time so sweet
Holding on to the memories, never skip a beat
Every time I remember it forevermore
In every hour of the night so, memories I feel it fall
Inna the year of'54
The summer vibes so sweet
Holding on to the memories
Never skip a beat
Iry times and iry memories
Forevermore
Inna me ahti nanga so
Memories of'54 encore
