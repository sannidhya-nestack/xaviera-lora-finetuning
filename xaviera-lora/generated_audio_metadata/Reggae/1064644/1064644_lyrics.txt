Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na-na, na-na
It's been a long lasting impression
It's been a real hurtful abrasion
This impression on me has left me weary
And now I got to find myself
Somebody show me
How to find an accent out of heartbreak lane
It's the journey that's been driving me insane
And I can't go through no more agony and pain
Woo-ay, woo-ay, woo-ay
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm insane, sane, sane
I'm insane, sane, sane
I can't maintain
I'm gonna put me back together one more time
Realized it was my fault and I went blind
I was foolish and mind
Thinking we would be fine
Now I'm crippled and aggravated
I've wasted my time
Somebody show me
How to find an exit out of heartbreak lane
It's the journey that's been driving me insane
And I can't go through no more agony and pain
Woo-hey, woo-hey, woo-hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
I'm insane, sane, sane
I'm insane, sane, sane
I can't maintain
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
I seem to lost my mind along the way
Na na na na na na na
I can't find it
Oh yeah
Can you show me
Help me find my way out of here
I can't find my way out of here
Somebody show me how to find an exit out of a break lane
It's a journey that's been driving me insane
And I can't go through no more agony and pain
Oh oh, oh oh yeah
'Cause I'm insane, sane, sane
I'm insane, sane, sane
I can't maintain, yeah
I'm insane, sane, sane
I'm insane, sane, sane
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
