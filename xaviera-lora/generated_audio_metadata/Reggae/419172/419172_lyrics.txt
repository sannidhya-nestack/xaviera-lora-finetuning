Wishing I'd never seen your face
How can I get out of this place
Yeah you've caused me so much pain
You know I'll never be the same
I just can't
I never felt so bad about you
I never been so sad
I never felt so bad about you
Why do I have to live like this
Being with you is nothing I'll miss
I don't want no hypothesis
But I could use some analysis
Oh yeah
I never felt so bad about you
I never been so sad
I never felt so bad about you
There's nothing left to say
It's all been said before
So sad about you
I never felt so bad about you
I've never been so sad
I never felt so bad about you
Yeah you caused me so much pain
You know I'll never be the same
Bad about you
Sad about you
I don't want no hypothesis
But I could use some analysis
Bad about you
Sad about you, yeah you caused me so much pain
You know I'll never be the same, bad about you
Sad about you, I don't want no hypothesis
But I could do some analysis, bad about you
