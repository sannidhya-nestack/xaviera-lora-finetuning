[MUSIC PLAYING]
Too much time to get it right this time you know that he
Can't figure out why his luck won't work his way with the females
Waiting too long thinking not going for one girl for her
They all sit around and wait for him forever
Time with the women that's time of his must takes
He's redeemed himself now it's all been erased
He's happier now no more smiles to frowns
He got his girl he's in his own world
Too much time to get it right this time
You know it ain't dead
Did you know why his luck won't work his way with the females
Waiting too long thinking not going for the blind girls
Hey don't turn around and wait for him forever
Time with the women the time of his mistakes
Treating himself now it's all been erased
Happier now no more smiles to frowns
Be kindest girl
Descendants of world (break it down)
Descendants of world
Descendants of world
Descendants of world (world)
Descendants of world (world)
The time with the women, the time of his mistakes
He's redeemed himself now, it's all been erased
He's happier now, no more smiles and frowns
He got his girl, he's in his own world
