Tell me what we're fighting for
Religion causing so much war
In the name of God
So what happened to peace and love
There's so much hate we're guilty of
This beating road we tried
There's so much beauty in this world
It's born in every boy and girl
Until we teach them hate
Come on it can start with us
broken mirrors just like trust can never look the same
Here it comes
It's closing in
Come let's make our love grow all around the world
Today
Hold your brother's hand
Let's understand
We'll find a way
We need love
Love
We need love, yeah
We need love
Love
We need love, yeah
Listen to the whispering wind
So silently she's creeping in
Fill up your cells with grace
Reach out to touch the moon and stars
Nothing seems so very far
Much too short to waste
It's hard to tell what struggles wait
Behind the barely open gate
Until we push on through
Words of gold and truth untold
Lost within a brand new world
So much the chosen few
Here it comes
It's closing in
Come let's make our love grow all around the world
Today
Hold your sister's hand
Let's understand
And we'll find a way
We need love
Love
We need love
Love
We need love
Love
We need love (love)
Play the game
We all can win
Here it comes
It's closing in
Come let's make our love grow all around
Hold your brother's hand, let's understand, we'll find a way
Come let's make our love grow all around the world
Today, oh just hold your sister's hand, it's time we understand
And find the way, yeah
Come let's make our love grow all around the world
Today, oh yeah
