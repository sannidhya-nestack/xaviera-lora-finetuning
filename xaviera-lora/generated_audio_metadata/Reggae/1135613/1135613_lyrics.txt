My nights and my bed
I sought her my soul, love it
I sought her but found her not
I'm just a dreamer
Dream to have you in my life
Dreams was made for reality
I made a sacrifice
I'm just a dreamer
Dream not once but twice
Dreams was made for reality
I made a sacrifice
Let she kiss me with the kisses of her mouth
Her love is better than wine
Her love is mine and I am yours
She is the fairest amongst women
Until the day is break
And the shadow rolled away, hey, hey
I'm just a dreamer
Dreams to have you in my life
Dreams was made for reality
I made a sacrifice
I'm just a dreamer
Dreams not once but twice
Dreams was made for reality
I made a sacrifice
Her love is like a roses
Straight to a young mans heart
The girl that I love so much
I am the rose of Sharon
She is the lily of the valley
As the lily amongst the thorn
So is my love amongst you
As the apple tree amongst three
In the wood
So is my love a great delight
And it's sweet to taste
I'm just a dreamer
Dreams to have you in my life
Dreams was made for reality
I made a sacrifice
I'm just a dreamer
Dreams not once but twice
Dreams was made for reality
I made a sacrifice
Draw me close to you
Cause I'm black but come black
Oh daughters of Zion
Her mouth is so sweet
All together lovely
Beautiful and wise
Her teeth is like a flock of sheep
Oh my dove
Your locks is like a roses into my garden
I open only to you hey
I'm just a dreamer
Dreams to have you in my life
Dreams was made for reality
I made a sacrifice
I'm just a dreamer
Dreams not once but twice
Dreams was made for reality
I made a sacrifice
Don't withdraw yourself from my companion
'Cause you are the only vision for me
My night on my bed
My soul search for who I love it
But I phone her not
And then my imagination go wild
And then my heart go ponder
Where in this world could she be
She drive my wireless dream
But now I can see
The dreams came to reality
