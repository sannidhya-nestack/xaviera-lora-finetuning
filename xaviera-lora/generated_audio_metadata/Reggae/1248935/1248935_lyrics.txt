United streets of Kingston town
The vibes in my flow, no need to frown
People skankin' to the reggae song
One love, unity all around
Kingston tone, the place where me love
Everything I read, blessings from above
Sun splashed vibes inna di air
Reggae music, we na have no fear
Other land try to bring us down
Hope we stay strong, we wear the crown
Rastaman chanting all around
Positive energy we never back down
Kingston tone, the peace from above
Everything high with blessings from above
Sunstashed vibes in the air
Reggae music we not half a fear
Babylon tried to bring us down
Hope we stay strong, we wear the crown
Rasta man chanting all around
Positive energy, we never back down
Kingston tone, a bliss of love
Everything high with blessings from above
Sunstashed vibes in the air
Reggae music, we not have no fear
From trench toe to rock foot
In every corner, reggae reports
All the money, legacy we support
And now the streets of Kingston we vote for
Kingston tone, the peace from below
Everything I read, blessings from above
Sun splash vibes in the air
Reggae music, we not have no fear
We not have no fear
Kingstone Town, the place where my love
Everything I write blessings from above
Sun splash vibes in naughty air
Reggae music we not have no fear
