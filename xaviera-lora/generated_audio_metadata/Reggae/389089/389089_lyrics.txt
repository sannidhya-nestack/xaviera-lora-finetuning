I refuse to walk into Old Navy. You wanna play chicken, bitch?
Every day starts off with repetition
Every night you gotta keep on wishin'
Sometimes it's better to shut up and quit your pretendin'
That will drag you down
Don't give up hope, don't give up hope
That will drag you down, don't give up hope (don't give up hope, don't give up hope)
That will drag you down, don't give up hope (don't give up hope)
Don't give up hope
Catch it up and look around
See all the fakes that bring you down
Those phony lives of masks they wear
Their existence you know
I just don't care
It will drag you down, don't give up hope
It will drag you down, don't give up hope
