It's a alien thing you know
You not do this for the money you know what I mean
I'll leave me till again
Me no do this for the money
Me no do this for the money

Me nah do this for the money
I only do this so God can get the glory
Me nah look no fortune and fame
I don't want nobody even call out my name
The word of God you know me come to proclaim
Christ and Him crucified me come to take down the line
Money is the root of all evil
Destroy your life and run away with a beagle
It's easy for a camel to go to a niggle
I done a rich man to end up in a Zaya night
Me nah do this for the money
Nah, me nah do this for the money
Nah, me nah do this for the money
I only do this so God can get the glory
Me nah do this for the money

Money make you feel just like a alien
Make you feel like you come from a strange land
I am a Jehovah you want walk on
Remember when Peter did say to the lame man
Phil Van Gogh me say have I not one but such have I have
I give unto I man in the name of Jesus rise up and walk
No the lame man feel like him just get a million
Me not do this for the money

I only do this so God can get me glory
Me no do this for the money

To build a kingdom and spread Christ all around
May not do this for the money
May not do this for the money
May not do this for the money
May not do this for the money
May not do this for the money
May not do this for the money
May not do this for the money
I only do this so God can get the glory
