Yeah, yeah, right now
I can't take it anymore
Baby, please come back
Ever since I met you
I've been thrilled with your tender loving
It was so good until you walked away the day
Now I'm so lonely
That's why I'm singing the blues
Baby you can change the situation
If you come back to me right now
Can't get you off my, off my, off my mind
I can't get you off my, off my, off my mind
I can't get you off my, off my
Off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
Let's sit and talk about it
Baby we can work it out
'Cause I can't stand this emptiness
I'm feeling right now
I'm missing good times we've had
Oh baby I'm so sad
Please walking back
You would make me so glad
Can't get you off my, off my, off my mind
I can't get you off my, off my, off my mind
I can't get you off my, off my
Off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
Oh, I love you and adore you
You're like my dream come true
Come on baby, let me show you my love is true
There's no other like you, my love is only for you
If you're not around, I don't know what I'll do
Can't get you off my, off my, off my mind
I can't get you off my, off my, off my mind
I can't get you off my, off my
Off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my, off my, off my mind I can't get you off my, off my, off my mind I can't get you off my, off mine, off my mind I can't get you off mind
