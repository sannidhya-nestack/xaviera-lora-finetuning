You have done it again
Told you fools rush in too soon
You'll stare the floor, the door out them
Yeah, man, I know she hurt you
You know you've hurt some too
It's a two-way street, my friend
You crossed the line for the last time
Choose your poisons wisely
It takes some time to sink this in
Change your perceptions please man
Before you sink us all again
Oh man, I'm on the wall
You've been here before
Oh man, I'm on the wall
When you sit so high up
You got to jump to get off maybe a ladder or rope
You could take some time
Low to grey, missed out on
Black to white, end to end, you could follow on
Nor fall in again
Got my white tie suit on
So get the hell out of my way
Go downtown down Main Street
Out of town on the highway
Old man on the wall
You been here before
Oh man on the wall
You're a fool for falling
On your knees you're crawling
In the darkness groping
For the things that you were missing
Everything that had a cause
Everything you thought you'd lost
Really cost you nothing
You found it buried in the yard
Choose your poisons wisely
Take some time to sink this in
Change your perceptions please man
Before you sink us all again
Oh man, you're on the wall
You've been here before
Oh man, on the wall
Oh man, you're on the wall
You've been here before
Oh man, I'm the one
