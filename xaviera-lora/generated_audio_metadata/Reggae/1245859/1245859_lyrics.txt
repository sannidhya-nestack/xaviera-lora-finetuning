Boom to the rhythm
Don't disappear
Popping fire
Hands in the air
Lift up to a high floor
From Kingston to London
Like this, like this
Shine down, come around
Feel the bliss, do like this
Spread the love and we won't miss
Feel the bliss
Move to the rhythm
Don't miss a beat
Up in the fire
Hands in the air
Let the good vibes flow
From Kingston to London
Like this, like this
Spread the love
If you want me
