Jah is my light and my salvation
Whom shall I fear
It is Jah who gives me strength
I will not be afraid
Yeah
The wages of sin is dead
Gift of Jah is life
Righteousness shall prevail on me soul Babylon
You can't put it down
Put a price, the wages of sin is death
Gift of Jah is life, the righteous heart will prevail
Show your hand from the camp, put a price on your life
For the material, by any means someone get it
Jah put a fire on the world cause of inequity
Babylon can't bribe me with money too
In the kingdom of Jah I found my blessing
The superficial, they stressing
Cause everything they see they want go get it
Only love brings happiness
Better you put love inna your chest
The wages of sin is death
Gift of Jah is life
Righteousness shall prevail
On me soul Babylon
You can put a price
The wages of sin is death
Gift of Jah is life
The righteous heart will prevail
Show your hand from the camp
Put a price on your life
Oh Jah deliver me
From the hand of the enemy
Blessed is he
Who walks with integrity
Let it arise
Wicked man scatter
High hollow place it no matter
Mr. Top shutter
Too much ratatata
You put fate in a gun
And none in the mighty jatter
Like smoke is driven away
All wicked man will dissipate
Fire blaze the way Jesus finished death
Gift of Jah is life
Righteousness shall prevail
Babylon can't put price tag on me life
The wages of sin is death
Gift of Jah is life
The righteousness shall prevail
Of me soul Babylon you can't put surprise
Blessed is he that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly
Or standeth in the way of sinners
His joy is in the Lord our God
And in his law he meditates day and night
He shall be like a tree planted by rivers of waters
Whose leaves shall not wither
And in everything he does he shall prosper
Though ages of sin he'll spare
Gift of Jah is life
Righteousness shall prevail on me soul Babylon
You can't put a price
The wages of sin is death
Gift of Jah is life
The righteous heart will prevail
Show your hand from the camp
Put a price on your life
For the material, by any means someone get it
Jah put a fire on the world cause of iniquity
Babylon can't ride me with vanity
In the kingdom of Jah I found my blessing
The superficial, they stressing
Cause everything they see they want go get it
Only love brings happiness
Better you put love inna your chest
The wages of sin is there
Gift of Jah is high
Righteousness shall prevail
Babylon can't put price tag on me life
The wages of sin is death
Gift of Jah is high
The righteous heart will prevail
On me soul Babylon you can't put surprise
