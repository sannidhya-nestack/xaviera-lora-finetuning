Yeah, it done him to the angel inna
Them say I was the real transformer
But me no say Jesus inna
Story, true story da
There was this man that really going through
And she seen a life and didn't know what to do
So he went to all his friends and his friends failed him too
Back against the wall and now he need a break through
Went to the bar to drink his problems away
But his problems get worse everyday so he remember how
Say his mama used to pray so he fall down on his knees
And this is what him say
Him shout out Jesus
Lord, please hear my voice, Him shout out, "Jesus"
Lord, transform my life, Him shout out, "Jesus"
Lord, said I heard your voice, Him shout out, "Jesus"
Transform her life tonight
This was this young man
Who claims that he mad done
Lock the city because him have the machine inna him hand
Money inna him pocket
Woman to woman now me run out of luck get pick up by the man
Now him inna jail shelling sell me six man
Two years from now
Him will be hanged for him got them pon the man
And them pon them knees
And leap up his voice
And leap up his voice
And shout out Jesus
Lord, please hear my voice, Him shout out, "Jesus"
Lord, transform my life, Him shout out, "Jesus"
Lord, said I heard your voice, Him shout out, "Jesus"
Transform her life tonight
This was this woman working kinda hard
Just to help her husband pay the bills in her yard
Things start get tough and times start get hard
Now the enemy want fish up her face in her yard
Went to all her work and come home feeling sick
Head ache, pain belly ache and vomit
When she reach out to her home and feel it on her head
Who was surprised to find a woman in her bed
Now she lay down upon the young and wounded
And the ball and all a roll and a little par-head
And she lift up her eyes and this is what she said
The woman, the woman, does just say
She shout out Jesus
Lord, please hear my voice, Him shout out, "Jesus"
Lord, transform my life, Him shout out, "Jesus"
Lord, said I heard your voice, Him shout out, "Jesus"
Transform my life tonight
