Who we gonna blame, for the mess the kids are in?
School, home or state, the case they trap you in
Coffee corners feel your brother
Don't need sugar to be sweet
Play together and discover
All the same on the street
Put a stop to aspirations
Beat the banner for success
Why's that we're forced to confuse them?
All because you're up and coming
Coffee colors fill your system
She don't need sugar to realize
Live together and discover her heaven shines
From her eyes
Tell the party it's on
Tear the barriers down
Tear the barriers down
Tear the barriers down
Those who said they'd stand up for you
Stand for nothing in the end
Don't be taken in by madness
Check the answer for yourself
Coffee, cola, steal your brother
Don't need sugar to be nice
Learn together and discover
Heaven shines from his eyes
Tear the barriers down
Tear the barriers down
Tear the barriers down
Tear the barriers down
Down, down, down
'Til the bar
Ba ba da ba ba da da da
the bar is down
the bar is down
Tear the barriers down
Tear the barriers down
Tear
Tear the barriers down
