In the streets of Kingstown town
Feel the beat running wild
Sun is high, drums are loud
Every turn a joyful smile
People dancing all around
Music flows like the sea
Catching vibes easy found
Life is sweet feeling free
Kingstown groove moving strong
Every heart sings along
Reggae tunes all night long
Feel the love in the song
Colors bright markets filled laughter echoes everywhere
Night falls lights on the hill warm breeze through the summer air
Friends and family gather round
Harmony in the air
Reggae rhythm wears a crown
Peace and love we all share
Kingston groove moving strong
Every heart sings along
Reggae tunes all night long
Feel the love in the song
People dancing all around
Music flows like the sea
Catching vibes easy found
Life is sweet feeling free
Kingston groove moving strong
Every heart sings along
Reggae tunes all night long
Feel the love in the song
In the song
In the song
Every heart sings alone
Feel the love in the song
Colors bright, markets fill
Laughter echoes everywhere
Night falls, lights on the hill
Warm breeze through the summer air
(He's just a song)
(He's just a song)
(He's just a song)
Fearful or fearsome
Colours bright markets filled
Laughter echoes everywhere
Night falls lots on the hill
Warm breeze through the summer air
