If you think it's worth it and I believe
et about the nature in me
I have a meditation for you
Smoke a sesamina and you feel the vibration
If you feel something is worth it to live
Reggae, reggae music, reggaemoon
Reggae, reggae music and it's okay to say it's in me, yeah
Live it for a child
If you think it's worth it and happily
etting by the nature you live
I have a meditation for you
Talk the sesame line you feel the vibration
Living for something is worth it to live
Reggae, reggae music, reggaemon
Reggae, reggae music, é o que eu sei assimilar
E vir fortear
