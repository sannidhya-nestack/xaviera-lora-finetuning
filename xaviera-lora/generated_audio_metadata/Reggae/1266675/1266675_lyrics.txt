I was walking down the street
A sad man slowly came up to me
I told him something face to face
Said the same thing I tell myself every day
Stuff happens, life's not perfect
One day you're up, the next you're down
Keep trying, keep on smiling
That's the way the world goes round
Don't give in too fast
Cloudy days won't last, tell yourself
The best two shall pass
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
When the world becomes too much
Always have a heart full of love
If you see a sad, lowing face
Say the same thing I tell myself every day
Stuff happens, life's not perfect
One day you're up and next you're down
Keep trying, keep on smiling
That's the way the world goes round
Don't give in too fast
Cloudy days won't last, tell yourself
This too shall pass
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
When the world becomes too much
Always have a heart full of love
If you see a sad lonely face
Say the same thing I tell myself every day
Stuff happens and life's not perfect
One day you're up the next you're down
Keep trying keep on smiling
That's the way the world goes round
Don't give in too fast
Cloudy days won't last
Tell yourself
This too shall pass
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Stuff happens, life's not perfect
One day you're up, the next you're down
Keep trying, keep on smiling
That's the way the world goes round
Don't give in too fast
Cloudy days won't last
Tell yourself this too shall pass
Oh, oh, oh
