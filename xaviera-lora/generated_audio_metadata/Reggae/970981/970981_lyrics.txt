Under the radar, dirty money, under the radar
Dirty money where you hide
Counting paper check it twice
Another day another like
Rolling dough is an easy life
Dirty money make you smile
Rich is far beyond the price
Pick a dish and cook it right
Dirty money make you high
Ooh la la
That's how it feels to have a pocket full of themes
Try to ambush ya
Eureka raw
That's an epiphany
You manifest your dreams and then you ooh la la
Under the radar, under the radar, ay
Over the counter, hour by hour
Under the radar, under the radar
Over the counter, hour by hour
Ooh la la, ooh la la
It's full of funny money
But you still feel hungry
Just cause you learned from the truth don't mean you live by the rules
And now the rich getting richer paint your own pretty picture
Dirty money telling lies
Spot a thief cut out his eyes
Run away with gold and dimes
Cause dirty money make you high
Ooh la la
That's how it feels to have a pocket full of thieves
Try to ambush ya
You'll recover
That's an epiphany
You manifest your dreams and then you ooh la la
Under the radar
Under the radar
Under the radar
Ooh la la
Ooh la la
Under the, under the, under the radar
Under the, under the, under the radar
Under the, under the, under the radar
Under the, under the, under the radar
Ooh la la, ooh la la, under the radar
Under the, under the, under the radar
Under the, under the, under the radar
Under the, under the, under the radar
Under the, under the, under the radar
Under the, under the, under the radar
Under the, under the, under the radar
