I promise I will never make you cry
I promise I will always put you first
Till the end of time
Till now and to forever baby
I promise that I will never ever leave you behind
I promise that I will always put you first in our lives
I promise
I promise that I will never give you reason to doubt me
I promise that I will love you'til the end of time
These words I have spoken with my mouth
But coming from deep down in my heart
Baby,'cause you're the center of my world
I promise I will never turn you a lie
I promise I will never give you reason to doubt me
I promise I will always put you first
Know you are the reason I'm so happy
if I lose you, baby, I'm screwed
without you, baby, there's no me
I wanna scream it out for the whole wide world to hear
I promise I will always put you first
'Til the end of time
now and'til forever, baby
I promise
That I will never ever leave you behind
I promise
That I will always put you first in our lives
I promise
That I will never give you reason to doubt me
I promise
That I will love you'til the end of time
That I will never ever leave you behind
That I will always put you first in our lives
I promise I will never turn you alive
I promise I will never give you reason to doubt me
I promise I will always put you first
Girl you are the reason I'm so happy
I promise
