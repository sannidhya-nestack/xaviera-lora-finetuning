I want you (I want you)
I want you (I want you)
I want you (I want you)
I want you (I want you)
From the first time I saw you
I knew I'd seen what I want
I couldn't get my eyes off you
You're just what I've been looking for
Where did you come from?
You're one real cute little thing
And we talk a while
And there is something I would like you to know
I want you (I want you)
I want you (I want you)
I want you (I want you)
I want you (I want you)
And there is something about you
That is giving me this burning desire
I've got this feeling, I just wanna get to know you
Just give me a chance, let me say what I have to say
Just be my girl and I would love you night and day
I want you (I want you) I want you (I want you)
I want you (I want you) And I want you (I want you)
I want you (I want you)
I want you (I want you)
And I want you (I want you)
I want you (I want you)
Let me take your hand
And your wish will be my command
Can I take you someplace?
Will you be my date?
What are my chances?
Becoming your man
Just tell me you like me
Tell me you will see me again
I want you (I want you)
I want you (I want you)
I want you (I want you)
I want you (I want you)
And I want you (I want you)
I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, yeah
