Put down that pencil and your ruler too
Do not decide to be hanging around the school
I spoke with Vanessa
And she agreed with Paul (she agreed with Paul)
They're gonna answer here for us
Whenever the roll is called
Watermelon is icing down
I've got the blankets here in the fall
Just need to make my style, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
To pick up my guitar, it's time for recess (recess)
Oh, because it's such a lovely day
I'm declaring recess, come on
You know it's time we played
I'm gonna miss a few classes
But they'll just have to wait
I'll study extra hard tomorrow
today I'm taking a break
Gonna miss a little history
But when this day is done
We'll riff on the history of having so much fun
I'm headed out to the parking lot
Darling don't let me leave here alone
Chance and Lauren will be back before they realize we've gone
It's time for recess
Oh because it's such a lovely day I'm declaring recess
Come on, you know it's time we played
Oh yeah
I don't know what tomorrow holds
Darling, I'm gonna live for today
I might have to pay the price
But that's the price I have to pay
it's time for recess
Because it's such a lovely day
I'm declaring recess, come on
You know it's time we paid
Oh yeah
I'm declaring recess yeah
Oh because it's such a lovely day
I'm declaring recess come on
You know it's time we pay
Time out
Na na na na
They'll just have to, they'll just have to wait, yeah
Much too nice a day, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na -na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na -na-na-na-na-na
