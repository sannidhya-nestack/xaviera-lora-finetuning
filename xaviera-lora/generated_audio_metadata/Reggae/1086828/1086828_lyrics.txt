Not because of the columnist, the nargile and the mirror
For me it's a phenomenon when you point and you sneer
So keep your head, your hands on your poke and your beer
With this trend ducking so far I have prepared an idea
Cause I could have been the only thing between you and your dreams
A world concurrency for me, no need for you to remind me
But what I could have been the only thing between you and your dreams boy
My name's Jeremy, my parents gave me all of the tools I needed to succeed and live steadily
I heeded their advice about weed and I readily died for my land and its greed, yo
I had the deed to my house at nineteen and I never felt the buzz of the police
Bees accept speed, so why is your superior?
I've made it my duty to judge you all
Based on religion, income and beauty
And so I've condensed and normalized, abusing each other
This is the end of humanity and loving your brother
So entertain me and my minions like a travelling freak show
Because their suffering sustains us, yeah, all you freaks know
So if this is what's become of us as civilized men
I might just cut my fucking losses and go live in Iran and war
Oh we got to try to keep it real when I feel
Like how did they leave for real, it needs to chill so why did you
In case you never really heard of us yeah
Then first degree bruise replaced this straight up in the southwest
Not because of the colour of me skin or the length of me hair
For me it's a bit alright when you point and you stare
So keep your ignorance and your count and your beard
With this trend I think the far I am may burn my beard cause hold
Could have been the only thing between you and your dreams
A world conquering schemes
But we don't need people like me man
What I could have been the only thing between you and your dreams
But I used to know this kid he back from my mum where you know the tribe
Kind of a lark and I find him out on a Friday night
Not really caring if he's heard or not
Rumbling with cops, running all his brains off
With the cheapest hops at even cheapest shops
Sleazing on the slag he thinks are hot and worth a pop
Blasting all his pals in slot machines
Living the dream, know what I mean
Self appointed king of the scene
Convincing more of a winner than his idol Charlie Sheen
Hoping not we must restore me
Under the guise of tend to bore me
I deploy the way they're always quick to label me insane
We don't like your tight round ears so get ready
Make this clear that if you don't fuck off from here right now
Then you'll get tossed out on your ear
I find it strange how people are so clumsy to one another
And yet always so quick to judge a book by its cover
Still, all we got to try to keep you feeling when I feel
Like the little people really need to chill so what the deal
In case you've never really heard of us yet
Then it's first degree burns we're blazing straight out to the southwest
Not because of the colour of my skin or the length of my hair
I mean something alright when you're panting you're scared
So keep your ignorance and your talk and your beard
With the same ducking of our every burden I bear myself
Could I blame the only thing meeting you on your dreams
Or where comes your instincts? I mean I mean
Think one like me but what I could have been
The only thing meeting you in your dreams
