Want or not?
Sunshine on my face
Waves call out my name
Rhythms here to chase
Life will never be the same
Feel that ocean breeze
Jamaica in my soul
Dancing with the trees
Let the good times roll
I wanna be the king
Of the Caribbean
Living like a dream
On the island sea
Stand beneath my feet
Music in the air
Red and heartbeat
Takes away my cares
I wanna be the king
Of the Caribbean
Living like a dream
On the island sea
Sand beneath my feet
Music in the air
Reggae heartbeat
Takes away my cares
I wanna be the king
Of the Caribbean
Living like a dream
On the island sea
Moonlight on the sea
Stars that shine so bright
Echo set me free
In the tropical night
Moonlight on the sea, stars that shine so bright
Echoes set me free in the tropical night
