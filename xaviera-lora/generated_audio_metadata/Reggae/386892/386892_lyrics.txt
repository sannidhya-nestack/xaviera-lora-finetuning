Well you know it's land, the girls lantern
Who's without equal when it comes to love and affection
I'm just here to take the girls to a higher dimension
Catch my slang
Well the girl dem say ya me dem want
So dem invite me to come over
Girl a flex, sexuated and raw
And a move like a lap dancer
Fling weh knickers and dem fling weh bra
So me draft me me rough rider
And start to push wood inna fire
From upstairs to downstairs and the cellar
From kitchen to bathroom and the sofa
Girl from UK and America
We no care if you a good as or if you a sloper
The girl dem rate me as dem number one lover
Girl I'm so excited and it drive me crazy
My queen, my princess much more than a lady
The sweeter than the roses, the sweeter than the daisies
No whiff, no but, no maybes, aye
Take it off (take it off)
Take it off (take it off now)
Take it off (take it off)
Take it off (take it off now)
Take it off (take it off)
Take it off (take it off now)
Take it off (take it off)
Take it off (take it off now)
Long time love the smile where you got
Them legs them thighs where you got
That pretty smile where you got
Love that teasing style where you got
Flying to the bottom then you wind to the top
Keep on your boots keep on your hearts
Love how you slowly take off your top
And then you turn then you twist then you rock up
Oh boy you drive me crazy

Keeping you happy and merry (too much, oh)
Head rush is spinning, tingling, hot for your tongue (take it off, take it off, take it off, take it off)
Take it off (take, take it off)
