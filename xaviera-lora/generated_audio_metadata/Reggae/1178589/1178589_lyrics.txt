Pretty lady, pretty lady, pretty lady, pretty lady
All night I've been admiring you
Beautiful lady
On the dance floor you've been dancing gracefully
I've been sitting here thinking of how I'd like to light your fire
Just to get close to you
Was my desire
Pretty lady let me hold you
I just wanna get close to you
All night I've been wanting to
Be with you
Be with you
Pretty lady let me hold you
I just wanna get close to you
All night I've been wanting to
Be with you
I get so thrilled just to dance with you
I just wanna get close to you (I just wanna get close to you)
Oh, I want you so badly (so badly)
Yes, I do, yes, I do (yes, I do, yes, I do)
Never thought I'd be dancing with you
Moments ago (I was dancing with you)
Never thought I'd be dancing
With the star of the show
Pretty lady let me hold you
I just wanna get close to you
All night I've been wanting to
Be with you
Be with you
Pretty lady let me hold you
I just wanna get close to you
All night I've been wanting to
Be with you
Pretty lady, pretty lady
Pretty lady, pretty lady
You are certainly
The lady of tonight
Every man has got you in his sight
You are certainly the center
Half attraction
Every man has been trying
To get your attention
And I know
Pretty lady let me hold you
I just wanna get close to you
All night I've been wanting to be with you
Be with you pretty lady let me hold you
I just wanna get close to you
All night I've been wanting to be with you
