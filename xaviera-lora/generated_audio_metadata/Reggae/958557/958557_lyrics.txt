Blues away
Wash your blues away
Blues away
Wash your blues away
We keep on hiding
We keep on fighting
But it never goes away (never goes away, oh no)
You can't deny it (can't deny)
Don't even try it (oh)
Don't throw your dreams away
Let's all come together
One shot and one sound, blues away
Away, away, away
It's all about the money
Ain't that funny
But money won't matter one day
Life is too short
So let's start living
Living for today
Let's all come together (ha ha ha)
One shot (one shot) blues away
They only give us enough
To keep us coming back for more
That's the score (that's the score, yeah)
We call it troubled times
It's always been the same
The same old game
So we keep on hiding
We keep on fighting
But it never goes away
We can't beat'em
Might as well join'em
Don't throw your dreams away
It's time we come together
And wash our blues away
Let's all come together
And wash our blues away
Raise those flags and borders, sons and daughters
And wash our blues away
We're gonna wash our blues blues blues blues away
We're gonna wash our blues blues blues away
