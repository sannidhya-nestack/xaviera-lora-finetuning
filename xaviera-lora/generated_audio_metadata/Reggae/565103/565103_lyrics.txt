I remember the day
When I met my beautiful woman
She promised to love me
And I promised to marry her
I remember the day

When I met my pretty woman
She promised to love me
I remember the day
When I met my beautiful woman
She promised to love me
And I promised to marry her
I remember the day
When I met my beautiful woman
She promised to love me
The first time we met she told me
She had to speak to the parents
She told me she had to speak to the elders
Then she would get back to me
One day she'll phone me and she'll say I'm ready for you
Promise me that you're ready to be my man and I'll be your woman
And I say, I promise, I promise
I been longing, longing, longing
To have someone like you
Never make you cry, never make you suffer
Never make you regret

Someone to care about me
Someone to look after me
Someone to make a family, hey, hey

Never make you suffer

When I met my beautiful woman (L-O-V-E)
She promised to love me and I promised to marry her
Tell them what I remember the day (Sing the song, sing the song)
When I met my beautiful woman she promised to love me
It's a dedication to all them lovers
Love the one you love, she's the one you love, it's the one you love
