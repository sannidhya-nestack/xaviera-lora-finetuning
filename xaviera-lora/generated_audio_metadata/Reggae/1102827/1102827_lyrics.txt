Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's throw it away
Throw it all away
Let's get away
Away from this place
Just you and me
Be alone with you
Let's get away from here (let's get away from here)
Let's get away from here (let's get away from here)
Let's get away from here
I'm dying to take you far away from here
Cool breeze on my body
Water from the fish on my feet
Don't you wanna get away
Let's get away from here
Wanna hold your hands and have a long walk with you
Well we're in a place where there's nobody but you and I
Don't you wanna get away from here
Don't you wanna get away
I wanna love you, love you, love you, love you, love until you walk the walk
Let's get away from here
Let's get away from here
Don't you wanna get away from here
Let's get away from here (let's get away from here)
Let's get away from here (let's get away from here)
Let's get away from here
Don't you wanna get away from here
I'm dying to take you
Far away from here
Cool breeze on my body
Water from the beach on my feet
Don't you wanna get away
Wanna hold your hands and have your walk with you
Where we're in a place where there's nobody but you and I
Don't you wanna get away from here
Don't you wanna get away
I wanna love you, love you, love you, love you, love you'til you want no more
