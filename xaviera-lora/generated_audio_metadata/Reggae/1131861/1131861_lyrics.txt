Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Cross over is the music of the future
Gotta let the people know
Cross over music only in one nature
Gotta let the people know
It's not the singer it's the song
It's the story being told
It's the feeling that you belong
Where the music's coming from
And when it gets right down to it
Everybody knows it
That this music ain't just a fashion
It's a multiracial voice that speaks
Kosova is the music of the future
Gotta let the people know
Kosova music all in human nature
Gotta let the people know
Walking down the city sidewalks
Sirens ring and music talks
The world is out on the back streets
Making sense of right or wrong
So graffiti's a million voice thing
Grime from the fallen walls
And in the street of the north face
Turn the music on the sound of war
What's all that is left? Music of the future
Gotta let the people go
What's all our music? Only human nature
Gotta let the children go
Cross over is the music of the future Gotta let the people know
Cross over music only human nature Gotta let the people know
Grasshopper is the music of the future
Gotta let the people know
Grasshopper music only human nature
Gotta let the people know
First of all, he's the music of the future
Gotta let the people know
First of all, music only in human nature
Gotta let the people know
Truth and love
First of all is the music of the future
Gotta let the people know
First of all the music only in Indonesia
Gotta let the people know
