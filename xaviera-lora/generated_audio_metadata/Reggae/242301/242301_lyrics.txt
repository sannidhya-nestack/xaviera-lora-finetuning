Woah woah woah woah woah
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah
Time ain't always on your side now
Tick tock
Time ain't on it's way to rescue you
Waiting ain't about to make it happen
Climb the high on what we're about to do
It could all fall down tomorrow (It could all fall down)
All the trust we built today
It could all fall down tomorrow (It could all fall down)
But let us build it anyway
It could all go down so easy (It could all go down)
It's not up to me to say
It could all fall down forever (It could all fall down)
But let us build it anyway
Tumble all the doubts you raised inside you
Knock knock
You don't have to know the reason why
No more making any walls between us
Lift your expectations to the sky
It can all fall down tomorrow
All the trust we build today
It could all fall down tomorrow (It could all fall down)
But let us build it anyway, hey yeah
It could all go down so easy (It could all go down)
It's not up to me to say
It could all fall down forever (It could all fall down)
But let us build it anyway
Build it anyway
It could all fall down tomorrow (it could all fall down)
All the trust we build today
It could all fall down tomorrow (it could all fall down)
But let us build it anyway
It could all go down so easy
It's not up to me to say
It could all fall down forever
But let's build it anyway
