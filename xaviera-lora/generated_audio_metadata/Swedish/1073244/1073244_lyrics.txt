Saw you by the Bridge of Sighs
Under blue Italian skies
Watching the gondolas glide
To the Adriatic Sea
Call it fate or destiny
That moment lives eternally
Somehow I knew I'd be
Forever, down for whatever
Endeavor you may have in mind
Together, we're down for whatever
I need you in my bloodline
Remember, I'm down for whatever
Bridge of sighs, last thing I see
For the penitentiary
Convicts sigh their last goodbyes
I don't need to be set free
I'll serve my sentence gratefully
Locked in the prison of your eyes
I realize now I'm
Forever down for whatever
Endeavor you may have in mind
Together we're down for whatever
I need you in my bloodline
Remember I'm down for whatever
The image of your face will always remain
Tattooed on my brain
Forever down for whatever
Endeavor you may have in mind
Together we're down for whatever
I need you in my bloodline (I need you)
Forever down for whatever (forever)
Endeavor you may have in mind (oh baby yeah)
Together (forever) we're down for whatever (forever)
I need you in my bloodline (I need to need you)
Remember down for whatever
Surrender down for whatever
Down for whatever
