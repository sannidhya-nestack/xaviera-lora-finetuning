I see her on the dance floor, shining bright
Tryna settle up a dance call at the loose o'clock
Every move she makes, she owns the night
Varje steg on tar, eg er natten så stark
With every glance, I'm falling deep
Med varje blik, jeg faller hjult
In a rhythm, I lose my sleep
In a slip, you're top of me sun
Love the way she moves, can't deny
Es que tu no la llegas en fin de ca
She's got a style that catches every eye
Unas diez son forma de herra
In every heartbeat she's the proof
You're breaking that circle it's meant
Yeah it's clear what I say
My heart approves
I love the way she moves
My heart approves
When she spins around
The world slows down
Now instead of jumping fast down now
Je effet trollat
Omnimi krona
I'm enchanted
She's my crown
Med varje drødse omkvær det sinne
With every move, she steals my mind
In her dance, I lose all time
In her stance, you're from the royalty
Love the way she moves, can't deny
Efter de vondel, she kan ikke finnekker
She's got a style that catches every eye
Vondel stils omfongen varje øvde
And every heart that she's to prove
You're like a head shark with its mouth
Dancing in your shade
My heart approves
I love the way she moves
My heart approves
In the moonlight, we sway as one, I'm on you
Så vi gungas om, den tändes rörelse
Som en vacker dröm, her movement
Like a beautiful dream, every touch, a spark that burns
Varje beröringen grister som vinner
In her arms, the world turns
Hennes armar, världen snurrar
Love the way she moves, can't deny
Ett sted om dagen, kan inte förneka
She's got a style that catches every eye
I'm not a steal so I'm forever on your radar
In every heart that she used to groove
You're ready at your own judgment
You're asking to rush it
My heart approves
I love the way she moves
My heart approves
You're asking to rush it
In every way
I love the way she moves
In every way
In her dance
I'll forever stay
Vargenastans kommer jag för alltid att stanna
