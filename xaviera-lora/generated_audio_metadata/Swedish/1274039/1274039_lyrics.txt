On the morning's hill, do we always stare high?
Brewing sips, nothing's true, taste not sweet for
Under the moon's glow, you and I we stand here
The bridges whisper night's peace
Quietly we two meet
A whisper, a smile, no words
Just stillness, we glance, it says it all
At the bridges hidden halls
And this gleam, it lingered in your wood
But I still hear, "Please come and say it out"
You don't stole the house
The bridges whisper night's peace
Quietly wait to meet
A whisper, a smile, no words
Just stillness, a glance that says it all
At the bridges' hidden halls
And this being a thing I'm learning I would
But I still hear, play it camp and say it out
We don't stall the house
En viskmynd, ett leende, inga ord, bara stillhet
Blicken den säger allt i bronstolda haug
