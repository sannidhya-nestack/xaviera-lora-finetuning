When you're feeling sad and have nothing to do
Really you are, you're feeling sad
You will feel great when you hear this song
You'll sing along because it's fun
I'm a little alien basketball player
Come on raise your hands and clap with me
I'm a little alien basketball player
Put down your hands and dance, dance with me
When you're feeling happy and have something to do
Don't lose something, do-do-do-do
Never mind the verse, now you know this song
You can sing along, because it's fun
I'm a Lithuanian basketball player
Come on, raise your hands and clap with me
I'm a Lithuanian basketball player
Put down your hands and dance, dance with me
I'm a Lithuanian basketball player
Put down your hands and dance, dance with
I'm a Lithuanian basketball player
Come on raise your hands and clap with me
I'm a Lithuanian basketball player
Put down your hands and dance, dance with me
