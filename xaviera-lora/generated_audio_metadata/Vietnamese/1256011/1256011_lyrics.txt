A band from Vietnam, hot beat like a drum
Lyric sharp as a foe, flow hot as the summer sun
From the streets of Saigon to the Hanoi skyline world
Vietnamese dropping rhymes so fine
Well Vietnamese, we're making history
In hip hop scene with flawless victory
Through the harmony and old melody
Well Vietnamese, we spit verse as fearlessly
Feel the harmony in our own melody
We're Vietnamese, we speak the verses fearlessly
From mountain peaks to utter tropical sea
We rise in the rhythm of unity
We're Vietnamese, all that they call us green
In this global stage, we're who we're meant to be
We're the world Vietnamese, making our own decree
In this global hip-hop scene
We're simply free
From mountain peaks to all the tropical sea
We rise in the rhythm of unity
We're Vietnamese on a hip-hop stream
In this global stage we're who we're meant to be
We're the world Vietnamese
Breaking our own decree
In this global hip hop scene
We're set free, free
