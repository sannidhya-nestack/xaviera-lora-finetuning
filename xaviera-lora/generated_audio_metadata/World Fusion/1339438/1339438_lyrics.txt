I'm counting down now, there'll never be enough time
So hasty, I'm blazing, there ain't no patience
Could speed us through this long line
So crazy, I'm waiting
Oh rinse me out, hold me down through it
Hold me down,'cause I'm so out of it
Pull me down, hold me now, I'm through this
Take me out, I'm so out of it
Hold me now, I'm standing on the high dive
Hold me now, hold me now, I'm never felt so alive
Hold me now, hold me now, I'm counting down now
There'll never be enough time
Soulbeats deep
I'm pacing, there ain't no patience
fear is through this long line
So crazy, I'm waiting
Pulls me up, hold me down through this
Pulls me down,'cause I'm so out of it
Pull me down, hold me down through this
Take me out, I'm so out of it
