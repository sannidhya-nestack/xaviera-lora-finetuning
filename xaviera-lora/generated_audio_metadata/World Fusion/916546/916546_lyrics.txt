(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Noise of plates and shouting merchants
One is cheaper than another
Price tags and negotiations
One is one but suddenly a dozen
Know which way to go
Magic happening before your eyes
Colorful, so colorful
Counter colors, hypnotize
Welcome to Bazaar
We got shiny souvenirs
Welcome to Bazaar
We have everything you need
Bye, bye and again bye
It's repeating all the time
And you dive into this rush like boogie
Spice cold and again spice
Voices merging with sunrise
And it seems like time is moving slowly
Welcome to Bazaar
Wandering through dusty shelves
Persistent salesman keeps on shouting
Thickering goods and you lose yourself
In this madness have you doubting?
And you don't know which way to go
Magic happening before your eyes
Colorful, so colorful
Counter colors hypnotize
Welcome to Bazaar
We got shiny souvenirs
Welcome to Bazaar
We have everything you need
Bye, bye and again bye
It's repeating all the time
And you dive into this rush like bogey
Spice gone then again spice
Voices merging with sunrise
And it seems like time is moving slowly
Welcome to Bazaar
Welcome to Bazaar
Welcome to Bazaar
We got shiny souvenirs
Welcome to Bazaar
We have everything you need
Bye, bye and again bye
It's repeating all the time
And you dive into this rush like bogey
Spice cold and again spice
Voices merging with sunrise
And it seems like time is moving slowly
Welcome to Bazaar
Welcome to Bazaar
Welcome to Bazaar
