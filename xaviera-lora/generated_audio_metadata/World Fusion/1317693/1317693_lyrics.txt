The whole world cried for love
The whole world cried for brotherhood
We hate your wars and crises
When will we have a rest?
Once again, life is our rights
Our fundamental rights
We insist mankind got to live freely
You got a wide lesson
From the past that the evil man passed
You got so wide lessons from the past
That the evil man lived in vain
So get your chance
And do what you can for all God to pass
Take your chance and do what remains
Don't you know mankind got to reign on earth
We are kings and queens in Jallo
The whole world cried for love
The whole world cried for brotherhood
We hate your wars and crises
When will we have a rest?
Once again, life is our right
Our fundamental right
We insist
Mankind got to live freely
To get so wide lessons from the past
That evil men live in vain
So get your chance
And do what you can for all God to pass
Take your chance and do what remains
Don't you know mankind got to reign on earth
For we are kings
And queens in yellow
The whole world cries for love
The whole world cries for brotherhood
We hate your wars and crises
When will we have a rest?
