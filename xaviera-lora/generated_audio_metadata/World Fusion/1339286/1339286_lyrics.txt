Everyday we learn a lesson
Why you always stressing?
Do you even believe you protecting?
You doing to me now
You said you happy I ain't laugh
But have you ever laughed?
I don't think you love me to my soul
Lot of mysteries involved
Now I no want save nobody body
Love nobody wrongly
Hurt nobody body
I just wanna hear from body body
Why ain't nobody disappoint nobody body
And if you really care about anybody
Then why you always making everything about you
It don't even matter that I want it
I don't even know what I mean to you
Cause you got me like yeah
Baby maybe we'll never know
I'm just saying I just wanna know
Got me like
So why you always bossing on me now
I'm just saying I just wanna know
Got me lying, oh yeah
Okay, okay
Everyday I'm yawning
Waiting, and whining
Baby you know the tire
This your loving is toxic
And instead deradiating
Some corny things
Hell in the morning
Then I'm running
What do you bring to my own interest
Your love will be like your own interest
You know one piece you're so conflicted
Losing your mind
Then why you always making everything about you
It don't even matter that I want it
I don't even know what I mean to you
Cause you got me like yeah
Baby maybe we'll never know
I'm just saying I just wanna know
Got me like
So why you always bossin' on me now?
I'm just sayin' I just wanna know, wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know
