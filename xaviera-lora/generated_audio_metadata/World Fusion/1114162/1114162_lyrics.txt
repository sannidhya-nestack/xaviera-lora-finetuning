I got one question
Baby
Are you gonna dance with me
With me
I'm in love with the way you shaking it
Baby baby you lose control
Got me thinking what to do with you
You set me on fire then fall in love
Be my lady you drive me crazy
Make me want to and fall in love
Thinking what to do with you,'cause I feel your fire, I just fall in love
I'ma get follow me go, oh baby follow me yo, oh baby killing me slow
My love ah follow me yo, I'ma get follow me go, oh baby killing me yo
Oh baby follow me yo, my love ah follow me yo, I'ma get follow me go
Follow me yo, my baby killing me slow
Follow me yo, I'ma get follow me go, oh baby follow me yo
My baby killing me slow, my love ah follow me yo, my love ah follow me yo

Baby dance to my rhythm and blues oh oh oh

Bakudu moku pe dekali ma, dekali ma
