ليلة الأسرار للملايين
أسرار للملايين
The night is cold and long
I barely keep hanging on
I sit here drinking my wine
Why did I give you so much time?
Just believe in you were ever mine, ever mine
In the night of secrets, our dreams and plans sunk into lies, into lies
In the night of secrets
Living cut off from life
You were never touched by strife
One day you took the fall
I found a chink in the armor
A gap in the wall
So big, so strong, so tough, so tall
Yet so very small
In the night of secrets
Head in the clouds to hide your fears
Denying it all
In the night of secrets
We could have had it all
Been in a love so grand
Now I think you understand
That we, we, we could have had it all
All the world for you and I
We could have touched the sky
Sad that it's now too late
But we, we, we could have had it all
But for the night of secrets
