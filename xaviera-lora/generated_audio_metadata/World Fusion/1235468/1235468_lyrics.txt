Huh, girl I'm lost in the shadows, feeling the pain
Story untold, driven insane
Lyrical wizardry, I'm breaking the chains
Bollywood Punjab, where my heart remains
In the darkest places, I found my light
Bollywood Punjab, we're taking flight
For me on the ground, we rise up high
English UK hip-hop reaching the sky
Streets of steel, the city sleeps
Echoes of pain, running deep
Speak my truth, let the rivers speak
Bollywood, Punjab, where my soul seeks
In the darkest places, I find my light
Bollywood, Punjab, we're taking flight
For me on the ground, we rise up high
English, UK, hip-hop reaching the sky
English, UK, hip-hop reaching the sky
