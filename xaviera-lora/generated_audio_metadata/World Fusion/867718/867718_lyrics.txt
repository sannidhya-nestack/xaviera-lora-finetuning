No more religion
I can't take it anymore
No more religion
Religions are but gangs and lies
They bring upon the wars that make our mothers cry
They're all one hypocrite
The Holy Wars, North Ireland
The Middle East conflict
They turn your trust to prejudice
Escape goats, the Southern Cross
The witches of Eastwick
They breed upon the weak and blind
They'll eat you up, spit you out
They'll hypnotise your mind
No more religion
I can't take it anymore
No more religion
What the hell you dying for?
They left you with an open wound
They nailed you to the cross with a crown of roses
Your fate sealed in your tomb
They breed upon the weak and blind
They'll eat you up, spit you out
They'll hypnotize your mind
No more religion
I can't take it anymore
No more religion
Why the hell you fighting for
Let guilt invade your freedom, you can't speak the truth out loud
Testament the prophet, in defeat you bowed
The sacrifice existence, in the name of
Prologuing the resistance, for the sake of your jihad
They spew out air, scream and yell
Oh, believe like I believe, or you'll go straight to hell
They breed upon the weak and blind
They'll eat you up, spit you out, they'll hypnotize your mind
No more religion
I can't take it anymore
No more religion
Who the hell you fighting for?
No more religion
I can't take it anymore
No more religion
Is it all worth dying for?
Can't eat meat on Friday (no more religion)
Blood be on your head
You put your hair in curlers
You paint a little dot in red
You praise almighty Buddha (no more religion)
Confess to me your sins
She's a witch that you'd hurt
Does anybody win? (no more religion)
