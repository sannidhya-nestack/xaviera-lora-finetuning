Island, you're my island
When this world is hostile I find refuge on your shores
Smiling, you keep me smiling
I use the word forever when I say my heart is yours
When the seas are rough, I know your beach is safe and warm
You're my sanctuary, you're my shelter from the storm
When I roam, you're my way home
Baby, you're my island in the sun
Water, sky blue water
When you hold me in your arms that's all that I can see
I found heaven's daughter
Baby when I'm near you it's like the world belongs to me
How'd I ever find you? Did God make a mistake?
And bless this poor pathetic fool who needs a lucky break
Best be believing I'm never leaving
Baby, you're my island in the sun
