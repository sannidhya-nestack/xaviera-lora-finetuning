The night is so dark and so long
And it will be lonely for some
But there will be stars, whispers of sunlight
Reminding us morning will come
Soon all the shadows will fall
But it isn't as sad as it seems
For safe in this house
Surrounded by love
We'll have the sweetest of dreams
But why is it dark at the end of day?
Why does the sunlight steal away?
I don't know the answer except to say
Even angels have to sleep sometime
Even angels have to sleep sometime
Even angels have to sleep sometime
But they're never far away
The trees have grown empty and bare
And the flowers have faded away
But in a blanket of gold
The fallen leaves hold the promise of spring someday
The winter comes bitter and cold
But we'll see the most beautiful sights
Crystalline days of magic and wonder
And silent and sacred nights
But why do the autumn skies turn grey?
Why do the songbirds fly away?
I don't know the answer except to say
Even angels have to sleep sometime
Even angels have to sleep sometime
Even angels have to sleep sometime
But they're never far away
