You can be my daddy tonight
You gotta know how to treat my body right
I can show you if you're ready to learn
I can show you when you can wave your turn
You gotta give this woman what she needs
You know the spot if you know that I'm a G
Lick it, lick it
If you wanna stick it, stick it
Lick it, lick it
If you wanna stick it, stick it
You gotta lick it, lick it
Dip that tongue low and move it slow
Accelerate the pace when you hear me moan
If you can make it rain, you're a striking goal
Don't be afraid to let your fingers join the show
Lick it, lick it
If you wanna stick it, stick it
Lick it, lick it
If you wanna stick it, stick it
If you wanna stick it, stick it
You gotta lick it, lick it
You gotta lick it, lick it
You know the spot if you know the energy
Lick it, lick it
If you wanna stick it, stick it
Lick it, lick it
If you wanna stick it, stick it
Lick it, lick it
If you wanna stick it, stick it
If you wanna stick it, stick it
Lick it, lick it
If you wanna stick it, stick it
If you wanna stick it, gotta lick it, lick it
