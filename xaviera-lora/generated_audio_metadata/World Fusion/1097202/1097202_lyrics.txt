You fool, you sold everyone who's got to know you
Befriend and save like a miser
Now who will ever take you home?
Now alone everything gets so complicated
Feeling so alienated
Where will deception take you now?
For love is something you always ache for
Attention is what you crave for
And there is nothing for you now
More of you now, narcissism
Full of hope, you finally reached the point
Fools in the house, living so far
Pacing forward, gets you so lost
So right from where you belong
Well now, everyone's out to get you
So now the pin that sticks out gets knocked down
Make a tweet, complain, get owned
More of you now, narcissism full of dreams
A tipping point, now it's where you lost
Whatever you have to do, go and do it now
There is no time for delays, go and do it now
There's no time for excuses, go and do it now
Go and do it now
