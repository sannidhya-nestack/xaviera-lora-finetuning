Sun upon our faces, warming all the spaces
Running wild, just two hearts beating loud
Laughing in the sunlight, dancing'til the midnight
Hold on tight, never let go, feel the glow
Brilliant love, shining above
With a spark in the dark
Footsteps on the beaches, whispers in the breezes
Every kiss a memory, just you and me
Brilliant love, shining above
With a spark, in the dark
Lightworks in the night sky
Forever you and I
Hand in hand we stand tall
Love's our call
Laughing in the sunlight, dancing'til the midnight
Hold on tight, never let go, feel the glow
Brilliant love, shining above
With a spark in the dark
Brilliant love, shining above
With a spark in the dark
Five steps on the beaches, whispers in the breezes
Every kiss a memory, just you and me, and me
Just you and me, and me
