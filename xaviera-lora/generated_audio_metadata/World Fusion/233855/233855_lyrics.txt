The ten stop of rain
You're playing the part
Glancing for another view
Livin' on our share
(Rafale tovi)
(Krasnosti Novotsk)
Exposing the search of
We've walked a long far
Clarity within myself
you found new love
I offer reason as a duty of sight
Curved memories, hidden in the sand
Eye of a reason, the beauty of sight
Might fade or change, but they never end
Prince of fading
Turning deeper blue
Silent words run through my hands
Hope friendship never ends
Eye of a reason is the duty of sight
Curved memories hidden in the sand
Eye of a reason is the duty of sight
Might fade or change but they never end
I offer reason
Her memory
I offer reason
Might fade or change but they never end
