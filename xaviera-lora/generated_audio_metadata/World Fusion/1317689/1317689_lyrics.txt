No cry
Black man no cry
No cry
I and I no cry
Weak leaders
Always see their strength
In suffering innocent people
Me say wicked always sees
Their satisfaction
In oppressing
Innocent people
Who caused
Bob Marley's cancer
Who eliminated
Black heroes
My brother fighters
Are still living
As lions in the jungle
No cry
Black man no cry
No cry
Iron eye no cry
No cry, black man no cry
Yes, my brother fighters
Are still living like lions
In the jungle because of a system
No cry
Black man no cry
No cry
I and I no cry
Middle again
Divide the country
Is forcing his future generation
To the bloody war
Can you tell who divided Africa?
No cry
Black man no cry
No cry
I N I no cry
No cry
Black man no cry
