Here in Sweet Soul Music
On the radio
Dialing up your number and hearing your voice
On my telephone
It's the sweet, sweet, sweet side of life
That tastes of your lips on mine
It's the sweet side of life
Like honeysuckle on the vine
It's the sweet side of life
The smell of jasmine in the morning air
Strawberry rhubarb pie
I could go on forever lord count the things
That make me glad I'm alive
It's the sweet, sweet, sweet side of life
That tastes of your lips on mine
It's the sweet side of life
Like honeysuckle on the vine
It's the sweet side of life
The sweet side of life
Shoo-wee-doo-doo, doo-wee-doo-wee-doo, the sweet side
