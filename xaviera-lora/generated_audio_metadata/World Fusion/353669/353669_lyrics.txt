I was standing in the front lines when the peace broke out
I dropped my gun and turned to head for home
In this war to end all wars
The life I led before seems almost gone
But August 1914 I was just a kid
Marching with a brass band and a gun
And the promises they gave all found out early grave beside the dun
I need to believe in what we're fighting for
Don't tell me everything's in vain
The newspapers call this the war to end all wars
Something tells me we're drowning in the rain
I held my best friend close, slipped out, this life ran out
And turned this trench to mud beneath my feet
All the medals that he wore went with his uniform beneath the paint
I need to believe in what we're fighting for
Don't tell me everything's in vain
The newspapers call this the war to end all wars
Something tells me we're drowning in the rain
We're drowning in the rain
Yeah, yeah, we're drowning in the rain
Yeah, yeah, tell me, is this the will of our nation?
Or some darker motivation
That makes us burn and die
What dark secrets might stand revealed
By the dead man buried in Flanders Reef
Drowning in the rain
Drowning in the rain
Drowning in the rain
Drowning in the rain
Drowning in the rain
