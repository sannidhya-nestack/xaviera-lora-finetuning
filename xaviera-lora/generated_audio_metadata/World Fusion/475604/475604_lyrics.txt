When the spirits will be all overnight
What do they think of you, my friend?
When the passion lays like wood in the fire
Maybe I could fall inside
Over here in the darkness of the night
Here we lie in the darkness of the night
But you'll see you think you're smarter than everyone
And you'd cry for the bright of the dawn
And there's someone who thinks you're somebody else
And nobody would see you gone
Oh, but you would find in the darkness of the night
Can we see the lightning of the storm
Can we fight in the darkness of the night
Are we long is the coming of the light
You are our light
You are our light
The light
You'll light up
Sight unseen
One day you'll find the secrets of the past
And the fog will speak to you in whispers
And the mindless touch would not be so enticing
And the gods would laugh in unison
Oh, but I know in the darkness of the night
He will laugh for the dawning of the day
I would not be alone with we see with many eyes
And we know in the darkness of the night
