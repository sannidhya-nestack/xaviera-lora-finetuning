Walking down the street
I see her smile
One glance and I know
This girl's worthwhile
She's my girl
Go find your own
She's my world
Leave us alone
In the crowded room
She catches my eye
No need for words
Her love my sky
She's my girl
Go find your own
She's my world
Leave us alone
You can look and stare
But you gotta know
She belongs to me
Our love will grow
She's my girl
Go find your own
She's my world
Leave us alone
You can look and stare
But you gotta know
She belongs to me
Our love will grow
She's my girl
Go find your own
She's my world
Leave us alone
