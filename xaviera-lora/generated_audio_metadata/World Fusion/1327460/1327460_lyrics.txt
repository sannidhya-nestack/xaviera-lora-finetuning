Don't take no stuff when you've had enough
Don't take no stuff when you've had enough
Old life in the city
People don't take no stuff
It ain't always pretty, say when, when you've had enough
Don't take no stuff when you've had enough
Don't take no stuff when you've had enough
Growing up in the city
You had to be tough
The riots weren't pretty enough
People were rough
I ain't looking for no cheap thrills
Just saying I've had enough
There ain't no magic she'll build
To bring it up to snuff
Don't take no stuff when you've had enough
Don't take no stuff when you've had enough
Don't take no stuff when you've had enough
Gangs have people running scared, strange politics in the hood
Gave up hope cause no one cared, stomping out all that was good
Trash talking my name, gonna say my sad goodbyes
City's just too wild to tame, I'm too tired of all the lies
When you're in the windy city
People try and call you bluff
It helps if you're witty
Life there can be rough
Don't take no stuff
When you've had enough
Don't take no stuff when you've had enough
Don't take no stuff when you've had enough
Don't take no stuff
