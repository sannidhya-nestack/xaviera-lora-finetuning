(sad trombone music)
Aloha my friends it's been too long
Come out and join me on this song
The lava flows hold us so strong
I finally feel like I belong
We can party all day
Mahalo ho aloha that's what they say
When evening comes we'll make a fire up the way
My friend will stand up make a toast and then he'll say
A while back I thought I lost myself and I
I couldn't stand the light of day
But then I found you, oh you saved me, oh I love you so
Ahui o aloha lupu loha
Till we meet again
Ahui o aloha lupu loha
Always be my friend
Ahui o aloha lupu loha
Till we meet again, we hope aloha, aloha
You'll always be my friend until the end
So for now we'll let the good times roll
Take it easy and take it slow
Let the waves overflow over you and me
Have you been feeling lost inside?
No direction and no pride
Let it go and you can smile
We can't go the extra mile
Ahoy, oh, aloha, lo, lo, lo, ah
we meet again
Ahoy, oh, aloha, lo lo lo ah
Always be my friend
I'm going home alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone
You're doing me again
I'm going home alone, I'm alone ,I'm alone
You'll always be my friend until the end
Ui o aloha ulu oa,'til we meet again
Ui o aloha ulu oa
Always be my friend
Ui o aloha ulu oa'til we meet again
Ui o aloha ulu oa
You'll always be my friend until the end
Bye now! Bye! Bye!
