We gotta do what you do, keep moving
I got fifty seconds to get you on the floor
And I don't wanna hear excuses anymore
there's somebody
Get up, get up, get up, let's rock tonight
Get up, get up, get up, let' rock tonight
I got 15 seconds to get you on the floor (whoa, whoa, whoa)
And I don't wanna hear excuses anymore
it's a party
Get up, get up, get up, let's rock tonight (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Get up, get up, get up, let' rock tonight
Feeling really irie
All up inna di party
Hands up inna di air and everybody feeling tipsy
Bottle top junk everything like a breeze
Having so much fun I've lost my TRTs
Jeez Louise how can this be?
Got a head secure next to my money
But the ambulance coming yesterday last early
Having so much fun and feeling carefree
I got fifty seconds to get you on the floor
And I don't wanna hear excuses anymore
it's a party
Get up, get up, get up, let's rock tonight
Get up, get up, get up, let' rock tonight
I got fifteen seconds to get you on the floor
And I don't wanna hear excuses anymore

Get up, get up, get up
Let's rock tonight
Get up, get up, get up, let's rock tonight
The bubbling pon the dance floor, step in tonight
By water flow a children holding up right
Everybody looking jiggy with a big smile tonight
Having the time of their life
Dancing, bubbling, making it count
Rocking to the beat until the whole thing run out
Moving, shaking, screaming and shouting
Being up inna the party, what's this all about
Everybody's rocking with some energy
Come and join the party
Set your body free
On the floor
Get on up
Get on up
Get on up
Get on up
I got fifteen seconds to make you scream
I got fifteen seconds to get you on the floor
And I don't wanna hear excuses anymore

And I don't wanna hear excuses anymore
