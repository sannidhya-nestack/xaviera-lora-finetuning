When the sun is sleeping
You shine in its place
My beautiful goddess of astronomical grace
You flow like water
Into my dreams as oxygen
You bring me to life with silver beam kisses on my face
I am your witty Sahara Unati
I am your Majnoon Sahara Moon
I am your lover, you are my queen
As you reign over this kingdom of emotions new to me
I am your worshipper and to you I swear
Ask me for Eden's apple and I'll bring you the whole damn tree
I am your witty Saharanati
I am your Majnoon Saharanoon
