I like to sail on the open water
I like to breathe the air way out there
To hear the seagulls fly right by me
You feel the wind waving through your hair
I like it just like that, I like it just like that
I know a place where the drinks are the dollar
They got some fish that they catch right there
For not much money we get us a hammer
And hide away both of us body bags
Sail o'er the open water
Sail o'er the open sea
Sail o'er
I'd like to have a little daughter
But don't tell anyone yet
That's just for you and me
I like it just like that
I like it just like that
I want it just like that, just like that
Don't let life hit you so hard you get too down
You got to climb up and have some fun
Don't stay too long on the bottom of the barrel
I will help you to stand up and we will see the sun
Sail on the open water
Sail on
I like to have a little daughter, but don't tell anyone yet
That's just for you and me
I like it just like that, I like it just like that
I want it just like that, just like that
Did fate bring us together
To enjoy all this sunny weather
Who knows, must have been something like that
Like that, like that
Just like that, I like it just like that
I say sail on the open water
Sail on the open sea
Sail on
I'd like to have a little daughter
But don't tell anyone yet
That's just for you and me
I sail, sail, sail, sail, ooooh
Sail, sail, sail, ooooh
Sail, sail, sail, ooooh
Sail, sail, sail, ooooh
