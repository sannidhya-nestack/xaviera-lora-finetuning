O God, I will go to the Lord and I will give him my life
I will go to the Lord and I will give him my life
I will go to the Lord and I will give Him my life
O God of the world, I am your servant, O God of the world, I am your servant, O God of the world, I am your servant
I'm on the ground and I'm down on my knees
O God of the world, the Lord of the heavens, the Lord of the earth, the Lord of the heavens
O God of the world, the Lord of the heavens, the Lord of the earth
O God of the world, the Lord of the heavens, the Lord of the earth
