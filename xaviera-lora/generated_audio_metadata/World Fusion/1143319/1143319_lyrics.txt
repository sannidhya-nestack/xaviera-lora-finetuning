What is your version of love?
If I could find the one that you're thinking of
Maybe I'd find that it's something we never was
What is your version of love?
You're alive
Nothing you say can change a mind
Because your actions
Prove all the things you deny
So do you love him?
Convince me that you're not thinking of him
You said you loved me
But the silence you give don't feel so loving
Oh, oh, oh, oh
What is your version of love?
If I could find the one that you're thinking of
Maybe I'd find that it's something we never was
What is your version of love?
So when you tell me
I'm over reacting, I'm silly
The things that I'm saying, I'm crazy
All the pain in my heart and it truly, truly frustrates me
What is your version of love?
If I could find the one that you're thinking of
Maybe I find that it's something we never was
What is your version of love?
Drive me crazy, baby
Drive me crazy, lady
I don't understand what kind of plan she dey banno
I don't understand what kind of plan she deyn banno
I don't understand what kind of plan she deynn banno
I don't understand what kind of plan she dey banno
What is your version of love?
If I could find the one that you're thinking of
Maybe I'll find that it's something we never was
What is your version of love?
What is your version of love?
If I could find the one that you're thinking of
Maybe I'd find that it's something we never was
What is your version of love?
