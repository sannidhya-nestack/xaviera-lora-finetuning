The night was cold and so was the gun held in his hand now
These were desperate times and to rob a liquor store was his plan now
But as he walked through the door
The storekeeper held a .44
So he had to shoot him down
You gotta run now
You gotta run now
So he stole a car
Then headed out for California
Then he telephoned his woman
And she said, "I think that I should warn you"
Or the cops will hunt you down
Then shoot you to the ground
Better get back in that car boy
You gotta run now, oh oh oh
You gotta run now
There was no turning back
He was driving down a one way street
Straight to eternity
Put all the pain along the edge of the sea
Run now, run now
His friends in New Orleans
Said he could hide out for a while there
But he needed gas so badly
He couldn't drive another mile there
And as his car was breaking down
Oh, he could hear the siren sound
Better jump right out of that cowboy
Gotta run now
You gotta run now
You gotta run now
You gotta run now
You gotta run now
