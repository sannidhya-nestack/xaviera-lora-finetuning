Dancing in the moonlight, shadows playing wild
Heartbeats in the twilight, like a little child
Feet moving to the rhythm, lights are spinning bright
Feel the magic in them, gonna rock tonight
Mamba wamba, feel the beat, take a step and move your feet
Mamba wamba, can't be beat, get together feel the heat
Set your foot on the floor
Hips swaying to the sound
Everybody wants more
Party all around
Move through the pace, let it shake
Lose yourself, don't forsake
Every move for the sake
Of this groove we'll make
Mambo Mamba, feel the beat
Take a step and move your feet
Mambo Mamba, can't be beat
Get together, feel the heat
Feet moving to the rhythm
Lights are spinning bright
Feel the magic in'em
Gonna rock tonight
Mamba wamba
Feel the beat
Take a step and move your feet
Mamba wamba
Can't be beat
Get together feel the heat
Swipe dripping on the floor
Hips swaying to the sound
Everybody wants more, party all around
Feel the bass, let it shake, lose yourself, don't forsake
Every move for the sake of this groove we'll make
Mamba wamba, feel the beat, take a step and move your feet
Mamba wamba, can't be beat, get together feel the heat
