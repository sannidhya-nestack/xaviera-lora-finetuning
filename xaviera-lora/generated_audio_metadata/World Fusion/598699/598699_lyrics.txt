Let the music play
The sun is rising and it's going down over my country
I lived another day
The village people are bringing out the drums
They bringing out the guitars and the music will play
Boom boom boom boom boom boom
Oh la baba
Boom boom boom boom
So tonya nyuka
Boom boom boom boom boom
Hey tonya nyuka
Boom boom boom boom
Boom boom, boom boom, boom boom
Boom boom, boom boom, boom boom
Boom boom, boom boom, boom boom
Boom boom, boom boom, boom boom
Oh, Africa, baba
Boom boom, boom boom, boom boom
(Fuwa) (Fuwa) (Fuwa)
When the famine's over and the war is over
When the dust has settled down, the guns are silent
We shall sing a song, El Mama Friga
We shall make the music
The sun is risen and it's going down
Over my country I lived another day
The village people are bringing out the drums
They bringing out the guitars and the music we play
Boom boom boom boom boom boom
Hey I'm pregame boom boom boom boom boom
So tonya yuka boom boom boom boom
It's party time I'm pregame boom boom boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
When the guns are silent, Baba (boom, boom, boom, boom)
We the party people (boom, boom, boom, boom)
Africa Baba (hey)
Africa Baba (oh na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Oh, Alabama
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Detroit, you don't come over
Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
What's up?
Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Oh, Africa
(Sweat on your new car)
