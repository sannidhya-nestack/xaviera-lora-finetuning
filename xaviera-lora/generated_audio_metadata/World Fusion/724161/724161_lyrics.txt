Anytime and sugar, sugar
Anytime and sugar, sugar
Some days are open for a flow
Sometimes it's just moments that let you know
And watch the world and how it grows
Bigger than life in so many ways
Love is a shelter, an emotional wing
With some lessons learned
They lead us to stay
Come on now, you feel me
Better than I wanna be
A flower young is all I see
Weaving up your destiny, playing hard
I can't believe it's true
Come on, don't you tease me
Pip it up for pleasantry
Tell'em you're a queen
Be no tattoo, have a cup of tea
Let's just say
It's all that's left to do
What you want
What you need
What I'd like
Anytime, sugar, sugar
What you have
What makes you feel so right
Anytime, sugar, sugar, anytime
I stray, we are in so many ways
On the same old path for so many days
Underpaid and just cast away
I'm tempted that we win the RIP
But that's not the way, this ain't no 3D
I'll tell you what
Between you and me
Oh come on now you see me
I'm sweeter and I'm tax free
A flower don't you disagree
Living up your fantasy
Playing hard
You can't believe it's true
Come on just please
Don't give it up to apathy
Tell you I'm a workaholic
No time for you to cop a plea
Let's just say
It's all that's left to do
What you want
What you need
What you'd like (anytime sugar, sugar)
What you have, what makes me feel alright (anytime sugar, sugar)
Come on now you feel me
Lighter than I wanna be
I blow on you is all I see
Living up your destiny
Playing hard
I can't believe it's true
Oh
Come on now she tease me
Don't give it up her pleasantries
Tell her you're her queen
Don't try to have her property
Let's just say
It's always left to do
What she wants
What you need, what I'd like (anytime sugar, sugar)
What you have, what makes me feel
All right
Anytime sugar, sugar, anytime
What you want
What I need
What we like
Anytime sugar, sugar
What we have
What makes us feel so high
Anytime sugar, sugar, anytime
And a dime of my sugar, yeah
I want you, want what you need, what you have
What you feel is alright, oh
And a dime of my sugar
