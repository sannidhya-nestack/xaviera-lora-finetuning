Break
Painstaking
I'm taking
Heart breaking
Times run out and now it's painstaking
Oh yeah

Heart breaking
Times run out and now it's painstaking
Premium
Fola ke gi mi naisio
She no dey minimize you
She want to own dey bank you
For me I just want utilize you
Kelekbe
Kelekbe kelekbe kilote
Ewo dey omokilokbe
No dey gawu no dey gagpa no dey play
Bodey bon bon dey bon
When I mash up dey place
See the look pon my face
Put dat in pon replay
Get dey flex in your waist
Me I move pon your case
Make you wipe pon me say
Me I spray you dey jera
I ain't giving nobody no satisfaction
I see enemies see them they gang up
You want the grace want the perform you be actor
Auntie Bella save your drama
No way no way no way brother Dilda see your lover
She want they come they follow me go
Now something bout that your bunda
Will make me one day follow you go
And I no go waste time on never
Say we live in Labida Loka
Or the island with me bros and we got like twenty baddies with me sippin on no make up
Couple ones for a bad bitch like a bendy
I eat the rum and I'm a bendy
Yeah, man I'm bleeding with it, stizzy with it, miss me with it
BS made them feel me with it
Them motherfucking piggies ain't gonna see me winning
The money hanging out my pockets so they see me with it
Skinny wild jigger
Even when you see me man I see you my nigga
I'm just business king me man I'm stacking my bread
I don't time for the chat
The land is buzzing it brother I can't tell from my vocals
I see you shorty I didn't party till like week
I'm the many, mi go go hebe lebe
I see you shawty at the party, kill it baby
Kill it baby, kill it baby, mi go go hebe lebe
Auntie Bella, save your drama
No way, no way, no way
Brother Jutta, see your lover
She want the gum, they follow me go
Now something bout that short bunda
Will make me one day follow you go
And I no go waste time oh never
Breathtaking, heartbreaking
Times run out and now it's painstaking, painstaking
Times run out and now it's painstaking
