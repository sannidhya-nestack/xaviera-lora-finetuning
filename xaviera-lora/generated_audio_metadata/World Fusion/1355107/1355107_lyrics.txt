When our chance comes along
We better be ready
time won't wait for long
Must be strong and steady
Don't let the naysayers
Step down on our dreams
Shut down the betrayers
Smash their dirty schemes
Let's go!
Stand up for right despite the cost
Lift your head to the sky all hopes not lost
You feel the sparks in your hearts
Fire blazing just take your shot
Because the worst is not to fail
But not to try believe you will prevail
Nothing can stop us or slow us down
Our time is now
We could be the glory
In ever blazing lights
We're living our story
Our time is now
Stitch it to the mission
we can win the fight
With purpose and vision
Our time is now
Now is the time, stand up and fight, it's all on the line
I know that we're gonna rise to the top and we'll never stop, it's our time to shine
They say, it's all in your mind, just remember all we left behind
We might have a ways to go, but at least we know we're well prepared for this moment
I believe we're gonna make it, miss the shots, we don't take it
Right down to the wire, sweat is dripping, can you feel that fire?
No change was made from our comfort zone, words cut deep like stick and stone
Have no fear, you're not alone, all together let's make it known
Stand up for right despite the cost
Lift your head to the sky all hopes not lost
You feel the sparks in your heart fire blazing
Just take your shot because the worst is not to fail
But not to try believe you will prevail
Nothing can stop us our slowest death
Our time is now
We could be the glory (we could be the glory)
And never blaze in light (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
We're living on starlight (we're living on starlight)
Our time is now (yeah)
Stitch it to the mission (right now)
we can win the fight (fight)
With purpose and vision (vision)
Our time is now
Our time is now
