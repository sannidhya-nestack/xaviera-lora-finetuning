She was made for this place
To be part of this place
The heart of this place
The seer had said
The heart of this place
The seer had said
The crumbling white
Sea that speaks to the stone
The heart of this place
Is shaping her soul
The heart of this place
Is shaping her soul
Bring her to me again she said
Bring her to me again
She was made for this place
To be part of this place
The heart of this place
The seer had said
The heart of this place
The seer had said
From the gate to the stair
From the stair to the dome
The heart of this place
Her spirit is home
The heart of this place
Her spirit is home
Bring her to me again she said
Bring her to me again
She was made for this place
To be part of this place
The heart of this place
The seer had said
The heart of best place
The seer had said
The crumbling white
Sea that speaks to the stone
The heart of this place
Is shaping your soul
The heart of this place
Is she made of your soul?
She was made for this place
She was made for this place
Again
