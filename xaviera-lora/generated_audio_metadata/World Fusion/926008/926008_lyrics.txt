When I look into your eyes
I see diamonds in the sky
When you smile
When you smile it warms the heart
It makes the body come alive (makes the body come alive)
Do do do do do do do do
We ain't getting any younger baby
Life is short so tell me would you stay with me
I know it's a little harder lately
But we gon' get by somehow, some way, oh, go, go, go, go
We gon' get by somehow, some way, oh go, go, go, go
We gon' get by somehow, some way, hey, hey, hey, hey
We gon' get by somehow, some way, oh go, go, go, go
We gon' get by just having little faces
Thought that if I loved in heart
They'll want to birth my child
See how beautiful you are so
And your heart is a gold amina
You are patient but you're not slow
And you've always walked with me on this road
We ain't getting any younger baby
Life is short so tell me would you stay with me
I know it's a little harder lately
We gon' get by, just have a little faith
We gon' get by, we gon' get by
We gon' get by, just have a little faith
We gon' get by, we gon' get by
We gon' get by, just have a little faith
Day, day, day, day
We gon' get by somehow, someway
We gon' get by, we gon' get by
We gon' get by, we gon' get by
We ain't getting any younger baby
Life is short so tell me would you stay with me
I know it's a little harder lately
But we gon' get by somehow, someway
Oh, go, go, go, go
We gon' get by somehow, someway
Oh, go, go, go, go
We gon' get by somehow, someway
Darling, we gon' get by
Just have a little faith
Let me tell you about your love, you can't get it back, but I love you
