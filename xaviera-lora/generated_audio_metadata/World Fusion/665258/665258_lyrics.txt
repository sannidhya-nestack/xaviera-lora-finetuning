Crying out for justice on the mortal man
In this enormous region we call planet earth
Where man was made to live free
Free of fear, free of oppression (yeah)
The sound of freedom
I can hear them teach
I can hear them preach
I can hear them bondmen singing (yeah)
Come let's sing a song of freedom
I have seen them flee, I have seen them flee
I have heard their voices chanting
The sound of freedom from black men white men
To the freedom of these sentries is true
Come let's sing a song of freedom

Oh na na, oh na na
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
War in diverse places
Reasons for pity
When the land is barren
People live hungry
Tell me what's the reason for this common tragedy
Many hearts are broken living in a corrupt system
Come and sing a song of freedom

How can you hear them teach, how can you hear them preach, how can you hear the police singing
