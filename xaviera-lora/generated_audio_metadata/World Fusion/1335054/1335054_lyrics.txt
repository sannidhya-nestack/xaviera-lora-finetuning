[harmonica]
Need some guidance myself
Tell me what to say
Tell me where to go and I'll go
Tell me what to know
I need some guidance
I need some guidance myself
I've tried everything
Nothing ever works for me
Still don't wanna lose all my faith in humanity
And I feel the pressure on me
Take your power back and never stay still
I'll see you there dream after dream
Take your power back we're here for a good time
I need some guidance, I need some guidance myself
I need some guidance, I need some guidance myself
Nothing ever works
Nothing ever works for me
Still don't wanna lose all my faith in humanity
Mmm, I need some guidance
And I feel the pressure on me
Take your power back and never stay still
I'll see you there, dream after dream
Take your power back, we're here for a good time
We're here for a good time (we're here for a good time)
Ah
I need some guidance (We're here for a good time)
We're here for a good time
We're here for a good time
We're here for a good time (I need some good times)
We're here for a good time (I need some good times)
We're here for a good time (I need some good)
