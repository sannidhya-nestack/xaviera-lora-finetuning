Rain is falling down my street
Splashing down into my feet
Jumping in puddles big and small
I can't get enough at all
Water's rising up so high
Jumping in puddles oh my my my
Soaking wet but feeling free
Rainy day is where I'll be
Laughter echoes down the lane
Friends and I get in the rain
Water's rising up so high (up so high)
Jumping in puddles oh my my my
Soaking wet but feeling free
Rainy day is where I'll be
Laughter echoes down the lane
Friends and I in the rain
Water's rising up so high (up so high)
Jumping in puddles, oh my my (my)
Water's rising up so high
Jumping in puddles, oh my my
Soaking wet but feeling free
Rainy day is where I'll be (oh)
Let the storm rage on outside
In the rain we will hide (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Let the storm rage on outside
In the rain we won't hide, hide
Water's rising up so high
Jumping in puddles on my mind
Soaking wet but feeling free
Rainy day is where I'll be
Water's rising up so high
Jumping in puddles on my mind
Soaking wet but feeling free
Rainy day is where I'll be
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, where I'll be
Oh, oh, oh
Let the storm rage on outside
In the rain we won't hide
