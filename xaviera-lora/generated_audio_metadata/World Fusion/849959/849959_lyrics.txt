Looking out for you, sitting by the window
Waiting for your footfall
Looking out the window
Of my soul
Of my soul
Reaching out for your shadow
Lingering in my memory
Looking out of the rain
For the sunshine of your love
Looking out the window of my soul
Of my soul
Looking out the window
Of my soul
Of my soul
I'm not gonna let you go
Looking out for you, sitting by the window
Waiting for your footfall
Looking out the window
Of my soul
Of my soul
