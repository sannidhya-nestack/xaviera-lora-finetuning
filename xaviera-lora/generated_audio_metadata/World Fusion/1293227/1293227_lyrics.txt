In Bombay, in Argentina, Bogota, Colombia, this is where it's at
Searchin' for a lamp post just to lean on
Dine a cup of coffee pal
Well I met her in Morocco
Sittin' in a casbah stirrin' up a brew
That's a milk so fine
I hurried on over just to try
Someone sippin' a taste of it and blew my mind
In Bombay and Argentina
Bogota, Colombia is where it's at
Searchin' for a lamp post just to lean on
Dine a cup of coffee pal
I turned around to have some more but she was not there
Moving like a shadow she went out the door
That mystical being that she made that cup from
I gotta find her again and have some more
In Bombay, Argentina, Bogota, Colombia is where it's at
Searching for a lamp post just to lean on by that cup of coffee pal
She broke my mind with that throw up of your hub or that drop of crystal just to ain't the same
That beancoating mama is a what I need now
Need a little coffee or I'll go insane
