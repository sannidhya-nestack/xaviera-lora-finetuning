The blue sky of Spain
I want to enjoy you and hear your chime
The blue sky of Spain
Lures me with its pure and natural depth
The blue sky of Spain
The land where the reeling strong men gone
The blue sky of Spain
The blue sky of Spain
The blue sky of Spain
The land that denies everyone being alone
The blue sky of Spain
The blue sky of Spain
Blue skies, of Spain, blue skies, the blue sky of Spain
La la la la
Blue skies, of Spain, blue skies, la la la la
I'll stay in blue skies
