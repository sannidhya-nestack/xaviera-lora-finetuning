Running through the city light shadows in the night
Got my squad by my side ready for the fight
Enemies lurking but we move in silence
Heartbeats counting a dance with defiance
Adrenaline rising feel the fire ignite
We own these streets yeah we take flight
Action thriller living on the edge
Hip hop beats on a razor's edge
Ghosts live in the alleys, secrets unfold
Danger in the air, stories untold
Chasing dreams while the world sleeps
In the heart of chaos, our mission deep
Adrenaline rising, feel the fire ignite
We own these streets, yeah we take flight
Action thriller living on the edge
Hip hop beats on a razor's edge
Force threatens, time slows down
In the heat of the night, we own this town
No back and down, we stand tall
In the game of life, we risk it all
Survival of the fittest, no room for the weak
In the shadows we strike, no time to speak
Every move calculated, precision in our steps
In this action thriller, no regrets
Adrenaline rising, feel the fire ignite
We own these streets, yeah we take flight
Action thriller, living on the edge
Hip-hop beats on a razor's edge
Let the dawn break and the night fades
Our legend remains in the moves we made
Action thriller, our story's told
In the heart of the night, we're brave and bold
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Whispers in the alleys, secrets unfold
Danger in the air, stories untold
Chasing dreams while the world sleeps
In the heart of chaos, our mission deep
Adrenaline rising
Feel the fire ignite
We own these streets
Yeah we take flight
Action thriller living on the edge
Hip hop beats on a razor's edge
As the dawn breaks and the night fades
Our legend remains in the moves we've made
Action thriller our story's told
In the heart of the night we're brave and bold
