Groovin' with my girl tonight
Underneath the city lights
Feel the rhythm in my feet
Dancing to a funky beat
Groovin' with my girl, it's magic
On this frozen night, fantastic
Holdin' tight, we're spinnin'round
Lost in music and its sound
Every step we take is gold
Heart beats fast and story's told
Laughter echoing so clear
In your eyes I see no fear
Grooving with my girl is magic
Under stars the night fantastic
Holding tight but spinning round
Lost in music and sound
Music lifting us so high
Touch the moon up in the sky
Grooving in this endless trance
Living for this one night dance
Grooving with my girl it's magic
Under stars at night, fantastic
Holding tight, we're spinning round
Lost in music and its sound
Moving with my girl tonight
Underneath the city lights
Feel the rhythm in our feet
Dancing to a funky beat
Grooving with my girl's magic
All these girls are like fantastic
Holding tight with spinning rounds
Lost in music and its sounds
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh
Grooving with my girl is magic
I'm just frozen like fantastic
Holding tight but spinning'round
Lost in music and sound
