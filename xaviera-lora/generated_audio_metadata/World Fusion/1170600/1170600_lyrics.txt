You gotta work it when it's wet

You gotta work it, work it
Workin' in this way
Wake up in the morning
Workin' in this way
Right after coffee
Workin' in this way
With cornmeal porridge
Workin' in this way
Cook manish water then bend me over
Big up Chicago
Workin' in this way
And San Francisco
Workin' in this way
Cross over Denver
Workin' in this way
Go somewhere lower
How far can we go on sugar daddy
Workin' in this way
And baby mami working when it's wet
With no more drama working when it's wet
Pick up your panty not there for mami

Whiskey and ice that make me nice
