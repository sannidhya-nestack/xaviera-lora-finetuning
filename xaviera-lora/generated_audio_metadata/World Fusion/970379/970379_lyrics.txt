How's it sound?
There's different sides, we're here to ride and common ground
Has yet to be found, did a breach, I'm on the beach and I got no holds
And I play for keeps, ain't no sinner, ain't no saint when you're in the lab
Nothing goes as planned, walk on shells, I'm back from hell, here's a souvenir
And there is no fear, did a breach
You're out of reach, you're overruled, you're cooking speech
Your big fat hands have ruined my plans
Now there is nothing on the team
Mirror mirror on the wall you've got the brightest smile
Your teeth are ten feet tall data breach
You're on the beach skipping rocks and stones
The ripples have all gone back in the lab
Process and plan and I save my work
Cause I play for keeps data breach
I'm leaving this bitch in for overload
This whole thing will implode
Data breach
You're out of reach
You're over wrote
You're cocaine speech
You're big dead hands
Have ruined my plans
Now I'm barely standing on the beach
Woah
You're out of reach
You're over broke
You're cocaine speech
You're big fat hands
Have ruined my plans
Now I'm barely standing on the beach
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh
Woah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
