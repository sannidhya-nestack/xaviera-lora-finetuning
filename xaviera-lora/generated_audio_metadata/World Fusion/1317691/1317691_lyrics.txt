On the red, naughty red
I and I rub it up
On the red, naughty red
I and I rub it up
We've been riding
From slavery
We've been riding
From bounty hunters
Facing our destiny
Without vanity
No time for vanity
On the red nightingale
I and I wrapped up
On the red, naughty red
We rub her dub
No time for vanity
Proud of ourselves
Some naughty dread
Some bingy man
Some Congo man
Some bongo man
I and I rub it up
Some kaya man
I and I rub it up
On the red, not the red
I and I rub-a-dub
On the red, not the red
I and I rub-a-dub
On the red, not the red
I and I rub a dub
On the red natty red
We rub a dub
No time to court
No time to gone
I and I just rub
I and I rub a dub
