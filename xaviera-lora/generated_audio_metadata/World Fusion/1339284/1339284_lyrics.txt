Mio gomo wa, moma gomo lo
They call me big man stain Mr. Governor
E gun gun ledi e shimari mari wo

Which guy matter, which guy matter
Which guy matter be this guy matter
Life too tough so I caught my dada
Softly madame don't kill my danao
My toe in tomato
Show ma joti palongo
Make you feel I'm in your soul
And the way you shat in my door
Nobis say I like your girl
Your girly want me no be flexing
Me I know they carry lots
Anything you think you wanna carry parts
And I like it when my way not to be packed
I said they turn up the bass, turn up the bass
Turn up the, turn up the, turn up the bass
So I fuck up the place, turn up the place
Turn up the, turn up the, turn up the place
Turn up the bass, turn up the bass
Turn up the, turn up the, turn up the bass
So I fuck up the place, turn up the place
Fuck up the, fuck up the, fuck up the place
Many niggas wanna ride with you
None of them are really gonna die for you
So I steady day my day
Only God they my way and I flex on it

It's gold rings and blings like Shaba
Just like Shaba
Just like Shaba
Hustle and ball and flex like Shaba
Momagbamolo
They call me big man stain Mr. Governor
