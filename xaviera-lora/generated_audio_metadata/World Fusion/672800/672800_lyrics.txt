So, you have landed or you've fallen
In the heat with the people floating all around you
Oh, you're kneeling over from the time change
A new culture has a lesson waiting for you
So, you've thrown me a curveball
In with the sun into the night
So, you've thrown me a curveball
In the night where I can't see it anymore
Home in the land of the shifting sands
I can't speak and I can't know where I land
So I'm living in another time
But I fear it's not so
The city smiles but I can't detect it
And it knows so much
So you throw me a curve ball
And let the sun into the night
Oh, you've thrown me a curveball
In the night where I can't see it anymore
So you throw me a curveball
And with the sun into the night
And you throw me a curve ball
In the night I can't see it where it lands yeah
So you throw me a curve ball
And with the sun into the night
Oh, you throw me a good ball
In the night where I can't see it, where it lands, yeah
In the night where I can't see it (where it lands)
Where it lands in the night of the shifting sands I can't see it
