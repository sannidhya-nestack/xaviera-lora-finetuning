All of those times you wander here and there
Never knowing where you can say where you're going
And all the while you let the city stare at us turning red
To the river always flowing
And all the lies you intend to do with your attitude
Doesn't matter that you're really here
And all the wires you still wander on to a shiny place
Where they don't know where you came from
Should you know that you say what you mean to say
And you know you should do what you mean to do
And you know you should do what you mean
Would you do what you say, would you say what you mean to do
All of this time you wander here and there
Never knowing where you can say where you're going
And all the while that you sit and stare at this turning world
To a river always flowing
Should you know that you say what you mean to say
And you know you should do what you say you'll do
And you know you should mean what you do
When you say that you mean when you do what you say you'll do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Say that you're here, say that you need to say
Say what you mean to say, say what you mean to say
Say what you mean to say, say what you mean to say
Do what you, do what you, do what you mean to say
Do what you, do what you, do what you mean to say
Say what you need to say, what you need to say, tonight
