Cold and sand beneath my feet
Sunrise whispers here to be
Dazzling dunes we dance in line
In this moment you are mine
Whispers in the desert air
Feel the rhythm everywhere
We're missing in ancient tunes
Underneath these desert dunes
We are dancing through the night
In the glow of desert light
Dazzling dunes, our hearts in doom
Lose ourselves in endless moon
Stars above us, shining bright
Guiding us with gentle light
Feel the magic, see the spark
Twirl together in the dark
Time stands still, the world away
Here with you, I want to stay
Echoes of a distant tune
Found beneath these dazzling dunes
We are dancing through the night
In the glow of desert light
Dazzling dunes, our hearts in bloom
Lose ourselves in endless moon
