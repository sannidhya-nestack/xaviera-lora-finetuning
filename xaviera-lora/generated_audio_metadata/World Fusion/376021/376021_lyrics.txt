I see no justice in this world
The world is like a jungle
Where the poor are oppressed and the rich do survive
Where money's not checked by the things that people barely cash in off
You see men make lies and put this glass themselves
And no one wanna stand and do what is right
You see the system of the world make the rich get stronger
While the poor even get more weak
You see we slave each other
See we kill each other
See we press each other without love each other
And look at this and it makes me cry
A world of war without justice
There is no justice in this world
I look around the world today I see a lot of confusion
I look around the world today I see a lot of oppression
I look around the world today I see a lot corruption
My brothers insist there is no justice in this world
For there has been no justice at all
I see no justice in this world
Today
Political nonsense, the law don't make sense
Men put world before their conscience
The masses on the street just sing this fence-less
While while leaders just live in luxury
Tell me who's right, tell me who's wrong
Nobody want to take the blame, their corruption
Is not the order of the day and who you are
Doesn't care no more
We said no to this lawlessness
We said no to the more precise
We said no to this injustice that is
Steering us about
I look around the world today
I see a lot of confusion
I look around the world today
I see a lot of oppression
I look around the world today
I see a lot of corruption
My brothers and sisters
There is no justice in this world
For there has been no justice in the world
I see no justice in this world today
In the system of this world I can't see no light
Nobody wanna stand and make it shine
Cement keys for demons, a key for gold
Though all on the middle we still take some life
Tell me when will we stand and cause a change
When will justice prevail over gold and silver
When will we understand that we are the savior
Our solution take the love in us and put on our nation
By not living for army but living for we all
Neglecting the riches and the power we strive for
And aim for that thing that makes it right
And that thing is casting a change today
And right now I'm standing for what is right
And right now, and right now, and right now
I look around the world today I see a lot of confusion
I look around the world today I see a lot of oppression
I look around the world today I see a lot corruption
My brothers and sisters there is no justice in this world
For there has been no justice in the world
I see no justice in this world today
We need to change the world
We need to make it right
We need to stand to our feet
And cause some change
Cause we can get love, peace and justice
If we just sit and watch
We need to change the world
We need to do it now
We need to change the world
We need to make it right
We need to stand to our feet
And cause our change
Thus we can get love, peace and justice
If we just sit and watch
We need to change the world
We need to do it now
We need to change the world
We need to change the world
We need to do it now
