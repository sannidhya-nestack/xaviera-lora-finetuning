The Asian sky rises high into the canyon night
There shining down upon the land of every man
Tibetan winds are reaching in
To jumpstart your enlightenment
Norwegian rains celebrate
The end of our bereavement
Now I see a multicultural world
It's a multicultural world
Come with me and share the breeze
Of a multicultural world
So peaceful and iving
We're living in a multicultural world
And your beliefs don't torture me
Or keep me any less free
With equal rights we share the night
And discard all the judging
As we see a multicultural world
It's a multicultural world
Come with me and feel the breeze
Of a multicultural world
So peaceful and iving
We're living in a multicultural world
Donning the dawn (donning the dawn)
Of inclusivity (inclusivity)
Will soldier on (will soldier on)
The number of guns will be carried
In a multicultural world
Come with me and share the breeze
Of a multicultural world
So peaceful and iving
We're living in a multicultural world
Yes, we're living in a multicultural world
The world, the world, the world, the world, the world
