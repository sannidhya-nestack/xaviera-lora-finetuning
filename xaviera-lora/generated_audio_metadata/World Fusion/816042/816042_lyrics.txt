Kalibu, in the land of Africa
Habarikani, Tanzania
Asante sana, for heaviness
Salta in gemma, glop, drop, dole
Africa
Such a beautiful place
With wonderful souls
Africa
Why did it take so long
To come here
To come here
To carry you
Jumbo
Beautiful kids
Hakuna matata
Inside your smile
Sama honey
We can't help more
Kuwaiti
Till next time
Africa
You're immersed in the nature
Hakuna Matata
Africa
I will bring you forever with me
In my heart
In my heart, in my heart
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ah, ah, Africa
Such a beautiful place
With wonderful songs
Ah, ah, Africa
Why did I take so long
To come here
To come here
To come here
