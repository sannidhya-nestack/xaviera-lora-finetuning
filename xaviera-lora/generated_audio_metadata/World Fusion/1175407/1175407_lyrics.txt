Thought I was lost but I'm where I need to be
Communication failed but I'm wide open it's what I need
Love's a verb it's not a noun don't say it but mean it
I'm not a word, I am the now
I need to just feel it
Don't stir up what you cannot finish
Don't light the flame if you wanna put it out
Oh
I am an open book, I let you turn my pages
But you're still reading another book, why didn't you just finish?
So don't let me in
If the room ain't empty
Don't give me the key
If you don't open your door
Don't stir up what you cannot finish
Don't light the flame if you wanna put it out
Oh, oh
I am an open book
I let you turn my pages
So don't let me in if the room ain't empty
Don't give me the key if it don't open your door
Don't stir up what you cannot finish
Don't light my flame if you wanna put me out
Don't start what you can't finish
Don't start what you can't finish
Just put me out (If you can't light my flame, you've just finished) oh no
Don't start what you can't finish (You've been lighting up my soul) ayy
Just put me out (If you can't light my flame, you've just finished) no
Don't start what you can't finish (You've been lighting up my soul)
Just put me out, oh no, don't start what you can't finish (you can't put me out)
Just put me out, oh no, don't start what you can't finish
If you can't like my play you should just finish (oh no)
Don't stop what you can't finish (finish)
Just put me out (oh) if you can't like my play you should just finish
Don't stop what you can't (what you can't) what you can't (what you can't)
Just put me out (if you can't like my play you should just finish
You came, you came and burned the world
