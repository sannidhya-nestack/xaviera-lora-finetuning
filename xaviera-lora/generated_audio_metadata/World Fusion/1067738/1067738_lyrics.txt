I love this world and its great delight
Though people try to ruin its face
It's such a shame that we have to fight
God's given place is about to die
Let's do our best to save our space
Let's stop our efforts to ruin this place
A million years we own this earth
We grew it to what it is today
Pollution and greed has brought us here
A world that's dying that brings us fear
Let's do our best to save our space
Let's stop our efforts to ruin this place
It's five to twelve and we're losing time to undo what we started to break down
Still possible to reverse this losing trend
If we're all prepared to go to the end
Let's do our best to save our space
Let's stop our efforts to ruin this place
Let's do our best to save our space
It's not too late
To fail
