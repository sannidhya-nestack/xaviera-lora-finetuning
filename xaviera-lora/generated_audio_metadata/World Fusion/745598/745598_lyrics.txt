That's not my name, that's not my name, that's not my name
Bad, young, something'bout that's wrong
Not tryna reclaim words meant to break
who needs enemies when you got traitors
Pick your crown up off the shelf
People gonna call you what you call yourself (that's right)
Yeah, now it's time for a change
Say that's not my name, that's not my name
I'm brighter, I'm bold, I can touch the sky
I'm a fighter, got faith that I can fly
I'm wiser, no I'm not the same
And if you call me otherwise I'ma scream that's not my name
That's not my name, that's not my name
That's not my name, that's not my name
Just like your father
You ain't gon' (beep)
Yeah, I see you staying on your grind
But you can't do it, you should just quit
You think you pretty, huh?
But them looks is all you got
Tell them, "No, it's not what you saying"
There's no way that's my name
That's not my name
I'm brighter, I'm bold, I can touch the sky
I'm a fighter, got faith that I could fly (that's not my name)
I'm wiser, no I'm not the same (that's not my name)
And if you call me otherwise I'ma scream that's not my name, that's not my name
I'm going, I'm going, that's not my name, I'm going
That's not my name, that's not my name
They can't tell you who you are, who you are, that's not my name
They can't tell you who you are, who you are, that's not my name
They can't tell you who you are, who you are
They can't tell you who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are
That's not my name, that's not my name (Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, that's not my name, that's not my name, that's not my name, that's not my name, that's not my name, that's not my name, that is not my name, that is not my name, that is not my name, that is not my name)
So get a lighter,'cause you a beautiful survivor
You so smart, you so ill, man, you so dope
You so thrilled, don't let them keep you down, man
You fightin' and you risin' and you climbin'
So tell them get the right name
