Oh yeah, yeah yeah
See them tryna put me down (all over, all over)
But them no fit to weigh me down (all over, all over)
Lifetime cruise, they no know
See the music putting me in a trance
And I'm still hustling in the block
We be tryna make it out from the hood
We demand them, we surprise them
If them shank us, we go shank them
I took all the honor, go drop them
I know they mind them, now they are on them
See them coming out, we go line them
Cause I surpassed them
From the east to the south
'Cause the west we belong (to where we come from)
We be steady blowing up all the charts (to where we sit up)
Satisfied is we going stronger (now we just up)
We the O .K. bop, we the O .K.
Give it up to the most'tina
Classic finish like I'm Ortega
Rule the streets like I'm Montana
We the O .K. bop, we the O .K.
Give it up to the most'tina
Classic finish like I'm Ortega
Rule the streets like I'm Montana (that's it, that's my boy)
Don't know
I don't know what you thinking about
Friends who become your frenemies
Life changing overnight
It's like I'm out of my space
But look at what you made me done
Look at what you made me done
We demand them, we surprise them
If them shank us, we go shank them
Had to carry on, we go drop them
I know they mind them, now they are on them
See them coming out, we go line them
I surpassed them
From the east to the south
to west we belong
We be steady blowing up at the charts
Start to fight this, we going stronger
We the okay but we the okay
Give it up to the Mustang
Classic finish like I'm Ortega
Rule the streets like I'm Montana
With the Ortega, with the Ortega
Give it up to the Mustang
Classic finish like I'm Ortega
Rule the streets like I'm Montana
Ote, ote, ote, ote, ote
Ote, ote, ote, oate, oate, oate, oate, oh yeah
Ote, ote, oate, oate, oate, oate, oate, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
