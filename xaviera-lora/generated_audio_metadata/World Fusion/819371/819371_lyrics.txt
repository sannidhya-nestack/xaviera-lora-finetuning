Cuando se pronto
Te estaba pensando
Cuando se pronto
I was thinking about you all along
When you were not home and on the phone
I was thinking of you all along
There's something about you
And we don't look away
Take me down, take me down, take me down, take me down
Take me down, take me down, take me down, take me down
Que todo se paró (take me down, take me down)
Cuando se petó (take me down, take me down)
Que todo se paró (take me down, take me down)
(Take it out, take it out, take it out, take it out)
Take this thing out (Take it out, take it out, take it out, take it out)
Cradle in front of a barrel
Cradle in front of a barrel
Someone will I fall?
We ain't having sex now
