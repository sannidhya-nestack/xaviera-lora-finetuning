Like purview, evanescent
It's so graceful but so gone
To try and hold the moment
The sight, the taste, the scent
Breathing the silk
To find the moment
To try and find the moment
But there's no way
To hold the moment
Like perfume
Evanescent
All the time unfolding
To try and hold the moment
The red, the salt, the sweet
Disting the day
To find the moment
To try and hold the moment
But there's no way to hold the moment
But there's no way to hold the moment
But there's no way
To hold the moment
