The parting of the Red Sea
Believe in miracles, believe in miracles, believe in miracles
Sign of heaven
Moshiach's coming
The sixth day war (shot long)
Moshiach's coming (shot long)
Every day, every life, every breath we take
Is another miracle, hey!
Found a lamp, a mass revelation
Shelf of blue, the whole world trembled
Teach children, through all generations
To shuva tefila
A new world's coming
Heaven on earth
A spiritual calling
