Lost in madness returning to sanity
Awake from a dream I was back to reality
Looking through the window as the rain came tumbling down
Stepped out the door and the rain kept falling
I didn't look back when I heard a voice calling
I made up my mind to walk away from town
Oh what a wonderful feeling
When you're glad, so glad to be alive
Oh what a wonderful feeling
Walking from the city into the countryside
Goodbye Babylon, I'm leaving you behind me
Goodbye Babylon, it's good to get away
Don't look for me, you're never gonna find me
Goodbye Babylon, I'm leaving you today
Oh, what a wonderful feeling
When you're glad, oh so glad to be alive
Oh, what a wonderful feeling
Walking from the city into the countryside
Goodbye Babylon, I'm leaving you behind me
Goodbye Babylon, it's good to get away
Don't look for me, you're never gonna find me
Goodbye Babylon, I'm leaving you today
Goodbye Babylon, I'm leaving you behind me
Goodbye Babylon, it's good to get away
Don't look for me, you're never gonna find me
Goodbye Babylon, I'm leaving you today
Goodbye Babylon, I'm leaving you behind me
Goodbye Babylon, it's good to get away
Don't look for me, you're never gonna find me
Goodbye Babylon, I'm leaving you today
Goodbye Babylon, I'm leaving you today
Goodbye Babylon, I'm leaving you today
