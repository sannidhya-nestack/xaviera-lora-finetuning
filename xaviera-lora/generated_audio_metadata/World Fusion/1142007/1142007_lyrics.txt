Never have died
Never have died
Never have died
Never have died
Oh man dem woulda get another endless secure gun, you know
Tough excess of us with double drum
That is an object we are undone, that's it
I woulda never stop crying
If you ever leave I woulda never stop crying
You think I'm way more right I woulda never stop crying
If you ever leave I woulda never stop trying
I woulda never stop crying I woulda never stop crying
If you ever leave a wood, I never stop crying
You take away my breath, I would never stop crying
If you ever leave a wood, I never stop trying
I would never stop crying
Remember when we used to march up our country path
Like a bull in spawn, the world would all have blown up
I drink from the same bottle with this true heart
When every man your first one, you make them sweep that
I'd worry not the forth but for your faith from start
I'd walk you to a restaurant and set the lunch at
Never bad mind me don't'cause dem have dem heart
The only thing dem can do is just start
woman I woulda never stop cryin'
If you ever leave I woulda never stop cryin'
You take away my rent I woulda never stop cryin'
If you ever leave I woulda never stop cryin'
I woulda never stop cryin' I woulda never stop cryin'
If you ever leave a wood I never stop crying
You take away my breath I would never stop crying
If you ever leave a wood I never stop crying
I would never stop crying
Well everyday dem get up on the same thing
At the top line dem two dem see how it a ring
The inner glass house no stone no flippling
The god of stone that one day will rock your wing
I just told her she know me never want her
Till we together and I'ma try it a hundred
Just in a short short stand up for my father
Just make sure you know me and I will never fall
A woman I woulda never stop crying
If you ever leave I woulda never stop crying
You think a way my breath I woulda never stop crying
If you ever leave I woulda never stop cryin'
I woulda never stop cryin'
I woulda never stop cryin'
If you ever leave I woulda never stop cryn'
You think I'm way more rent I woulda never stop cryin'
If you ever leave I woulda never stop crynin'
I woulda never stop cryin'
Never stop cryin'
Never stop cryin'
Never stop cryin'
Never have gone so wrong
