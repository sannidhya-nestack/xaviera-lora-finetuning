The placebo effect
Makes it easy to correct
The serum with the effect
The better to select
The placebo effect
Is just too much
The souls with the defect
To make them perfect
We've had to try
We're not to cry
The way that we set us off to domino effect
Down to fly, we long to cry
The music sets right, ambition defies
The clouds before have fled
It does seem to have fled
Even those who defect
And even the slave
Of the plastic moment of death
Makes it easy to project
On worlds that they erase
A hatred to the same
The state line runs too late for us to change
The heart line runs two feet far away to manage
Our life is this way, coming back again for the day
Each second weighs a hundred years, there are thousands still to come
The plans we've known ain't the best
Makes it easy, correct
There are ways to defend
The better to select
It's not the way we're meant
It's just too late
There's always ways to defend
To make them proper
