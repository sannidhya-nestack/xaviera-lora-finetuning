But deep in my heart I feel the beat
Echoes of love in every street
Simple words we can't define
So, so, so your hand in mine
Deep in my heart the fire burns
A melody that it always turns
Round and round it's you and me
Endless rhythm we can't see
Walking through the night so cold
Worn by stories left untold
Every step I take with pride
You're my strength my constant guide
Deep in my heart the fire burns
A melody that always turns
Round and round, you and me
Endless with all we can see
Even when the lights go dim
I still feel your love within
Every moment, every breath
Deep in my heart beyond death
Deep in my heart, the fire burns
A melody that always turns
Round and round, just you and me
Endless rhythm we can't see
