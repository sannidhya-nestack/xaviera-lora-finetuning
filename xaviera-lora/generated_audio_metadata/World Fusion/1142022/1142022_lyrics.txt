See ya! See ya!
I rise to fight right, God I and I (yeah)
We can't monocure, trample I
I give praises to the most high (to the most high)
Give praises to the most high, yeah (to the most high)
I rise to fight right, God I and I (yeah)
And we can't ain't knowin' why
I give praises to the most high (to the most high)
Give praises to the most high, yeah (to the most high)
Ride, I get my phrases to the most high
It's the fall guy, falling out the sky
Looking to fly, but you on why?
There's no need to test I, wise beyond my years
Used to wet behind your ears, in confession with your peers
There's obsession over here, hard to find the right direction when you're not standing near
I know they fear me, putting my life at stake like Philly
But really, to put it bluntly, all the best wishes homie, good will hunting
But I know one thing for certain, when evil's lurking, God's working, eyes hurting
From your wide eyes searching
I'm closing the curtain
On an insignificant person
You're working without a purpose
I got God on the line homie
This is customer service
If I walk the far right
God, Diane and I
We keep my neck young, Trampoline
I give praises to the most high
To the most high
Give praises to the most high
To the most high
I rest before I die and die
And the wicked ain't knowing why
I give praises to the most high
To the most high
Give praises to the most high yeah
To the most high ride
Everyday I'm in the zone of praise
Constantly aware what's going on
Like Marvin Gaye
With no time to debate
I'ma live in this hate
Amongst all the rhetoric of these slithering snakes
Hidden in the landscape
Juicy like a fat grape
I heard it through the grapevine
You was trying to take mine
To make wine
But it takes time
Not overnight I'm not a red eye flight
I'm a Jedi knight
And I said I might
Just spare your life like Christ
For the right price
It's not monetary
It's missionary
You can be my adversary
And be found in the cemetery
I'm never worried, giving God his glory
Sharing my story while I'm hustling like Barry Gordy
Recording, is this thing on?
I don't need an enterprise for me to cling on
I lost a foreign guy, die and die
Wicked money can't trample I
I give praises to the most high (to the most high)
Give praises to the most high (to the most high)
I rest before I die, die, and die
On the wicked day knowing why
I give praises to the most high
To the most high
Give praises to the most high, yeah
To the most high, right
