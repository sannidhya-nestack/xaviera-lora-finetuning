One beautiful day my star will touch hers
One beautiful day I'll move on
One colourful way I'll go and my me go
One beautiful day I'll chay on
Just chay on (on, on, on)
My own chay on (on, on, on)
In the mood chay on (on, on)
Going home, Cheyenne
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
One topical island we'll be drinkin'
Ten beautiful seas we'll break out
One surgical mask we'll put on sailors
Unstoppable magnets I own to try on
On our own tray on (on, on, on)
In our throne tray on (on, on, on)
On our own tray on (on, on, on)
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
In the book of fashion we'll be caring
For marvelous gold, son, I'm back
Come look at the camp out on seven
And one beautiful day we'll chay-on, just chay-on (on, on)
Full and grown, chay-on (on, on)
Never known, chay-on (on, on)
On, oh try on, dance on, try on, on, on
Do-um-de-dum-stum, do-um-de-dum-stum
Do-um-de-dum-de-dum-de-dum-dum
De-um-de-wat-wat
But don't live up on
Don't live up on
On, on, on my own chain
On, on, on in the mood chain
On, on, on going home chain
On, on, on
On, on, on, my own chain
On, on, on, in the mood chain
On, on, on, going home chain
On, on, on
On, on, on, my own chaion (on, on, on)
In the mood chaion (on, on, on)
Going home chaion (on, on, on)
