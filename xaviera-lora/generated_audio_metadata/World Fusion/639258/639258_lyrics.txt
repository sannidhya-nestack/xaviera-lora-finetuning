Something's growing, and hypnotizing
Your effort's showing, but it's not on you
Everybody
Things you're glowing
But I know who you were before you knew
You wander out the streets, it's fair enough
You're running over solos, it's fair enough
All in love in war is fair enough
There's nothing on the streets now is fair enough
Every passage has an ending and you're no different
Though you disagree, I have no patience
For stubborn actions embody someone who thinks they're free
You wander out the streets, oh, is fair enough
You're running over solos, is fair enough
There's nothing on the streets now, is fair enough
All in love and war is fair enough, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough.
