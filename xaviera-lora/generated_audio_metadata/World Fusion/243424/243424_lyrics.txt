Life around us is so colourful
If you want to taste its sweetest fruit
If you want it
You must take the bitter too
When you find it
Give it all your love
Don't try to make it happen
And don't think of what you haven't got
When you find it
Just give all your soul and heart
All is love
And love is us
All the world
The world is love
Either you give
Or you can't get enough
Revolve, revolve around the love
Once you've got it
Treat it like a treasure
Don't et it
And don't take it for granted ever
now you've got it
So giving your thanks will just bring you more
All is love
And love is all I ask
All the world
My world is love
Either you give
Or you can't get enough
We all revolve
Revolve around the world
What you desire is what you can't hold
For it to come to life you just let it go
All is love, and love is all
The world is love, need you again
For you can't get enough
We all revolve, revolve around love
All is love
Love is lost all the way
The world is lost in you again
Or you can't get enough
We are in love, we are in love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
