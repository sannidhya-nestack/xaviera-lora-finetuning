You go to work, you get your pay
You come back home, and then you stay
And back to work, you have to make your move
And then back home
And try to play
It's gonna get you each day you're moving on
Work and you're going on
Life will keep moving on
Cycle just keeps rolling on
Each day you're moving on
Work and you're going on
Life will keep moving on
Cycle keeps on
You see the years
They're moving by
And lose the time
So hard you try
Spend your last sleep and full of dreams
And then you wake right up trying to get paid
