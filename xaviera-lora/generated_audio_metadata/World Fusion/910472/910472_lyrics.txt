I said that you alone can't make me feel again
I might just lie again and again
Until the light comes to my head
I can't be everything that I said
'Cause I see things my way
They say the sun shines
They say the sun does shine
They say the sun does shine
Gonna tell you man
And now we are high
'Cause I'm still on fire, hold my hand'til I'm right, all alone
Take my time to hold, right on tonight
And my way
On the highway
I'm still on fire
Roll my head to the light
Right on the low
Take my time to roll right onto light
I'm through
Through
I'm through
