Through the abyss of blue, can't see the ground
Diving deep, I can't be found
Her gaze like ocean, vast and wide
Waves are feeling like I'm high
Current's pulling, hearts aligned
Depths of love like finest wine
Sinking slowly in her stare
Breath of smoke, sleep of share
Scuba diver in her eyes
Waffle at the end of sky
Silent waters hear my cries
In her gaze my spirit flies
Coral reefs of tender lies
Shimmering dreams in the night
Echoes whisper in the deep
Promises that we both keep
Flowing water motions getting close
Her place I love the most
Heartbeat echoes under waves
In her eyes my soul she saved
Silent moves her breath as one
Beneath the surface calm and dumb
This the times you lose each one
Lost in depths you truly run
Who will die there in her eyes?
Schooled on diver in her eye
Bawled at the end of time
Silent warlords hear my cries
In her gaze my spirits fly
Cold reefs of tender light
Shimmering dreams in the night
Silent waters hear my cries
In her gaze, my spirit flies
Coral reefs of tender light
Shimmering trees in the night
Echoes whisper in the deep
Promises that we both keep
Fluid motions getting close
Her embrace I love the most
Heartbeat echoes under waves
In her eyes, my soul she saves
Sunny the whole street
