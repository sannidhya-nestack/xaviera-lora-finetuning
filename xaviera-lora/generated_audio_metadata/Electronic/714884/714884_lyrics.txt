You and me, we're under fire at the edge of the world
Your body's so magnetic, your eyes connect and connect
We'll set the place and I want you
We're on fire at the edge of the world
The pulse of our desire swallows our entire universe
Are you ready to et everything we've known?
Where love dies, where the rebels
Locked together by gravity
So run away, run away, away with me
this is not our home
Headed toward a trillion stars, freedom is ours
Set our course, we are the Genesis
You and me
We're on fire at the edge of the world
The pulse of our desire swallows our entire universe
You and me
We're on fire at the edge of the world
Your body so magnetic, your eyes connect kinetic
We'll set the place and I want you
Darling, feel adrenaline reset
I'll heal your deepest wounds
Where light shines, they'll never get us
I'm the wings of a trinity
So run away, run away, away with me
this is not our home
Headed toward a trillion stars, freedom is ours
Set our course, we are the genesis
You and me, we're on fire at the edge of the world
The pulse of our desire swallows our entire universe
You and me, we're on fire at the edge of the world
Your body's so magnetic, our eyes connect, kinetic
We'll set the place and I want you
You and me
We're on fire at the edge of the world
The pulse of our desires
Swallows our entire universe
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you
Universe
