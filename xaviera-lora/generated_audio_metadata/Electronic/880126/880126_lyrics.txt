No, you can't be my genie, I've had my three wishes on my own
Now I'm leaving harmful and vicious
Harmful and vicious
Harmful and vicious
Harmful and vicious
I'm falling
I'm falling vicious
I'm falling vicious
I'm falling vicious
I'm falling
And I'll release your fears, show me your halo now
And I'll release your fears, show me your halo now
Can't be my junior, I've had my three wishes on my own
Now I'm leaving harmful and vicious
Harmful and vicious
Harmful and vicious
Harmful and vicious
I'm falling, I'm falling vicious
I'm falling vicious, I'm falling vicious
I'm falling, I'm falling vicious
I'm falling vicious, I'm falling vicious
Harmful
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's harmful
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's harmful, you know
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's vicious, I
It's harmful now
