Watching from the door
I always wanted more than
You were et me nots
Dancing in the wind
Now I'm leaving a bouquet of memories
Where nothing is real, nothing is real
We were just there to be, we were just there to be
Yes I'm afraid, so afraid
That I'm a little, a little bit in love
Yes I'm afraid, so afraid
That I'm a little, a little bit in love
And I'm just wondering, do you miss the scent of seduction?
I'm just wondering, do you see the colors of passion?
And I'm just wondering
Do you still taste desire
When nothing is real, nothing is real
We were just there to be, we were just there to be
Yes, I'm afraid, so afraid
That I'm a little, a little bit in love
Yes, I'm afraid, so afraid
That I'm a little, a little bit in love
Your intensity is killing me
Shut up and kiss me
Your intensity is killing me
Yes, I'm afraid, so afraid
That I'm a little, a little bit in love
Yes, I'm afraid, so afraid
That I'm a little, a little bit in love
Yes, I'm afraid, so afraid
That I'm a little, a little bit in love
Yes, I'm afraid, so afraid
That I'm
A little, a little bit in love, yes
I'm afraid, so afraid
That I'm a little, a little bit in love, yes
I'm afraid, so afraid
That I'm a little, a little bit in love
A little better now
A little better now
A little better now
