I dread the thought of getting out of bed
And I just need another hour to clear my head
Somehow some way I gotta get a start to my day
But how and why?
I want to know if I, if I give up
How will I be loved
Never again will I drink
Tequila
I hope
I wasn't out of line and
My memories
Are hard to find
Somehow some way
I gotta get a start to my day
I know the key
That's enough don't you drink some more
I can't believe how bad I feel
Never again will I see it
Tequila
I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it
Never again
Never again
Never again
