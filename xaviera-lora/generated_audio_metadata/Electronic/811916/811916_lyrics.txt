Hanging around
Cold on the ground
Feel the sound
Breathe the sun go down
Star anew, star anew
Star anew, star anew
Come go back, come go back, come go back, come go back
Come go back, come go back, come go back, come go back
Fly away
Find a way
Fly away
Find a way
Fly away
Fly away
Ooh
Home is lost
Won't be on the frost
Once a being with us
So rest your head
Live until your dead
