Nothing, nothing changes but how you disappoint me
Pour a drink and take the floor now
Distant party faces, mistakes with no reason
You'll always be the last to leave here
You'll never leave here
You only came to hold tight, it's a lonely night
Watching your footsteps, goodnight spotlight
Dance floor in the tech block
Watching your foot steps on caught spotlight
Mirrors on a glass floor this isn't what you came for
You only came to dance
Dancing in the backlight, an incandescent midnight
The monochrome glamour of the disco, just a photo
You only came to hold tight, it's a long night
Watching your footsteps, goodnight spotlight
Dance floor in the tech block
Watching your footsteps on the corks for the lights
I engineer my life with perfect composure
Living and breathing, escaping in the noise
You see at night, without the echoing lure of the dark room
I lay awake, dreaming of zedless fame and moneyless glory
Displete, retreat, petite
Deceit, complete defeat
Disgrace, retreat, defeat
Heartbeat, backseat, deceit
Complete defeat
Hold tight, it's a long night
Watching your footsteps, goodnight spotlight
Just a photo, just a flashback
Hold tight, this a long night
I'm watching your footsteps, goodnight, spotlight
'Cause that's what it's meant to be
Watching you floating down on top of the line
I just can't seem to find the beat
Defeat, retreat, retreat
