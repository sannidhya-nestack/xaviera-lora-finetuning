Two, the far view
Two, the far view
Two, the far view
Two, the far view
And leaping fishes mark circular targets
Where red faces of admirals flicker
Like bull's eyes hit so many times
That emptiness starts to fill their space
To the far view
To the far view
To the far view
To the far view
To the far view
To the far view
To the far view
To
To the far view
To the far view
To the far view
To the far view
To the far view
To the far view
To the far view
To the far view
The thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you, the thought of you,
The fog too, the fog you
The fog too, the fog you
The fog too, the fog you
The fog too, the fog you
The fog too, the fog you
The thought of you, the thought of you
To the thought of you
To the thought of you, the thought of you
To the thought of you
To the thought of you
To the thought of you
To the thought of you
