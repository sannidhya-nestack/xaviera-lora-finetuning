My hands are trembling, sitting at the table
I try to push it down, look you in the eye
You've got a lot of pills left on the counter
And all your stuff is in travel size
Now I'm on a roll, little high
My missed connection, I don't wanna know how it ends
Now I'm on a roll, a little high
No recollection, I don't wanna know how it ends
I'm in this theatre, waiting for the ending
I'm in this hollow room, hitting the rewind
You're just a filament, hotel electric
You're just somebody's passing by
Now I'm on a roll, a little high
A magnest connection
I don't wanna know how it ends
now I'm on a roll, a little high
No bad collection
I don't wanna know how it ends
Now I'm on a roll, a little high
My missed connection
I don't wanna know how it ends
And now I'm on a roll, a little high
No recollection
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know
I don't wanna
