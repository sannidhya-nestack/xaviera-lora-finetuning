I think you know who I am (who I am, who I am, who I am)
I think you know who I am (who I'm, who I'm, who I'm, who I'm)
The undying
See my reflection on the full moon light
Make my connection to the other side
I hear the echo of ancient calls
I will lead the midnight ride
Around the corner, every dark street
How will I greet who I will meet?
Friend or foe, friend or foe
Looking in the eyes of eternity now
I'll meet you there my love
And lay your body down
My heart is buried with you
In the cold hard ground
How long does it take
When time has no time
That is the question of my immortal life
I think you know, I think you know who I am
I think you know, the undying
You could know my altered state
My sealed fate, it's way too late
Make a way before the day
No time to waste when I don't have time
I'll meet you there my love
And lay your body down
My heart is buried with you
In the cold hard ground
How long does it take
When time has no time
That is the question of my immortal life
The endless search
To reunite
That is the quest of my immortal life
I think you know
I think you know
I think you know
I think you know who I am
I think you know
The undying
How long does it take
When time has no time
That is the question of my immortal life
My endless search to reunite
That is the quest of my immortal life
I think you know, I think you know who I am
I think you know, see I'm dying
I think you know, I think you know who i am
I think you know, see I'm dying
See my reflection in the still night
My connection to the other side
I will lead the midnight ride
I'll see you on the other side
