Turn with it darling
Stomp away your nightmares
Fire trails are glowing
Ashing up your dark head
Swing out your hatred
Hell is now well aware
Tied up, lost
With your head to the ground, anger overturned
You'll never learn until you burn
Erratic emotions requesting me to repeat
Shadowing dances that translate when evil speaks
Tied up, lost with your head to the ground
Anger over time, you'll never learn until you burn
Expose all emotions, turn heads looking dead
Kill the satisfaction and just force feed them lead
Death by desire, death
Tied up, lost
With your head to the ground
Anger overturned
You'll never learn until you burn
Tied up, lost with your head to the ground
Anger overturned, you were never loved until you burned
