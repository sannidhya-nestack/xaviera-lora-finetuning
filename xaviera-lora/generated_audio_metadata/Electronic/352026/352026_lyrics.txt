Let me tell you what I did
Took a jet from Germany over to Madrid
Connected to the groove that got inside of me
Blinded by the atmosphere it was hard to see
I became so mesmerized from those señoritas
Sexy, shapeless, silky fine, would love to be beneath ya
It's so hard to respond when my lady by my side
Next time I will leave her home and take a solo ride
Madrid boogie, boogie-woogie, Madrid boogie, boogie-woogie, Madrid boogie, boogie-woogie, talking about Madrid, boogie-woogie, Madrid boogie
My dream boogie, boogie, boogie
My dream boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Singin'bout my dream, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'm there, got flair, Javier, are you there? (Oh)
Even when it's raining, the sun is shining down
I'm so high it's hard to keep my feet up on the ground
Tapas and cañas, the party is a motto
And the night is not complete without my friend El Coto
Only here for one night, but don't worry my friends
I'll be coming back to catch the boogie once again
Don't worry of me cause I'll be back again
To catch the boogie in Madrid again with my friends
