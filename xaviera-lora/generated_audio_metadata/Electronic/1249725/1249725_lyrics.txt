Did you ever have a wish for a girl who could inspire?
A ten thousand year itch with hell of a heart desire?
Well let me introduce you please to a girl who fits the bill
I think she took the lil' red pill
She's a sight to see, this money
A smile worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She struts in her high heel shoes
Life's got better, she got everything to lose
Ashes so fly, you have to get an airplane, see the one cost
Lots of pretty penny, come and get some
Would you like a little treat?
Turning heads everywhere, trust me there are very very many
She's a little more than filthy rich, one tough bitch, welcome to the sweetness
Oh Ms. Money, you're 160 sweet honey
Is it fame that you adore or missing money?
Now you got a little, would you like a little more?
Missing my B?
Sweet little honey, I can see that you are vexed
Take a minute, check your mobile, tell me if you got my text
Flicks of both the nest and I can see that you've been messing
With some things I think you think could be
You've never seen before
She's got a wallet that is quite the little fatty
Generous she is very very very catty
Buying up the love it's something that she can't ever seem to get enough
Of a swipe of a card and let me play the part
Crashing it very hard in the market for her heart
Oh miss money
You're a fantasy
I think about you everyday
I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person to a person in your life
Maybe you're a girlfriend, maybe you're a wife
It's money, oh she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of greed in her eye
She's a fiscal fairy, fluttering bomb
She's got a stockpile of sweet admirers
All just deep assets that are fueling her desires
She trades her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment not selling just a pocket
Her laughter rings like a cash register chime
But love's a currency she can't seem to mine
Her loyal youth hearts, oh what a portfolio
But the dividends of love she'll never really know
Miss Money, oh she's no dummy
Buys long lines, never ever chummy
With a twinkle of green in her eye
She's a pistol fairy, fluttering by
A market of romance, she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold, they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh how she's meant to seize
She's a penny pincher with a golden touch
But the cost of love, it seems too much
Miss Money, oh, the irony's not lost
Can't budget for love, it's an endless cost
Now she's bankrupt in the market of hearts
A fiscal failure torn apart
But oh Miss Money, you're still a sight
In the cold hard cash of the night
Miss Money, oh she's no dummy
Bites long but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of green in her eye
She's a disco fairy, fluttering by
Here's to Miss Money, the belle of the ball
May your essence be liquid
