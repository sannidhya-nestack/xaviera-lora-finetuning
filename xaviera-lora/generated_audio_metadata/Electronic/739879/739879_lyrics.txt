I'll fly, free from the sky
Give you all the reason I'm not a bad guy
I'll fly, free from the sky
Give you all the reason I'm not a bad guy
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw, outlaw, outlaw
Please don't say you're the reason I'm not affectionate
Outlaw
It's more than I, you're the reason I'm not afraid to die, I'll fly
It's more than I, you're the reason that I'm not afraid to die, I'll fly
It's more than I, you're the reason that I'm not afraid to die
How black, beautiful sky
You're the reason I'm not afraid to try
How black, beautiful sky
You're the reason I'm not afraid to try
