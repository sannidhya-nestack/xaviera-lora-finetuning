Another trip down the road
Loving from afar is getting old
Tell me something I didn't know
Stay on the phone'til I get home
Don't go this one time
I can see the sadness in your eyes
It's only one night
'Cause I don't wanna have to say goodbye
How come it rains when the sun shines?
When you're not by my side
You know it rains when the sun shines
Got me bottled up inside (it stops raining)
It stops raining (it stops raining)
When you're not by my side (bottled up inside)
It stops raining (it stops raining)
It stops raining when you're not by my side
Goodbye
Goodbye
It starts raining, it starts raining, it starts raining when you're not by my side
