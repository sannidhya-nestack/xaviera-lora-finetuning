Going to Kenosa, there's an EQ in their hand
They're going to Kenosa, giving in to his demand
They're going to Kenosa, there's a war that must be planned
They're going to Kenosa, to patriot the land
They're going to Kenosa, got an EQ in their hand
They're going to Kenosa
Going to Kenosa
Going to Kenosa
Separate the church and state
Separate the church and state
When I was a child I was greatly impressed
By the pillar dome of the church
The ceiling was high, equating with pie
And the stairs went on forever
A light shone through ungilded glass
Right onto the altar
There were candles melting and incense burning
In a cup overflowing with the blood
Of countless saints who sang
At the presence of the great harlot
Help me, help me, help me, help me, help me (repeat)
Going to Canossa
Going to Canossa
Going to Canossa
Separate that church and state
Separate that church and state
Going to Kenosa
Going to Kenosa
Going to Kenilworth South
