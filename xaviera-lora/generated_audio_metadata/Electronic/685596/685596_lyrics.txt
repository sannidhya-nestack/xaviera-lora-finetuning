It's dark, it's silent, as I lie next to you
Cases are drawn, time sleeping, we are unaware
It's been years we're together
Who would've thought
We can make it last forever
It's not that hard
If you give, if you listen, if you love
It's all or nothing, it's what it's about
I'll do it again and again and again when I know it's right
No one can tell me this ain't nice
I'll do it all over again just to have one more night with you
Skin on skin on skin
Skin on skin on skin
I will never let you down
I will always be around
Why don't you just tell me that you love me
I know you've heard before
You say I might need more
But I know that you're the one that's right for me
It's all or nothing (all or nothing) it's what it's about
I'll do it again and again and again when I know it's right
Skin on skin on skin
Skin on skin on skin
I will never let you down
I will always be around
I will never let you down
I will always be around
I will never let you down
I will always be around
