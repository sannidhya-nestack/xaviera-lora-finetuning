Throw your dust to the wind
Learn every man you can
And it's only'cause you can
I don't care, I don't care
If it's love that kills me then
Lying down, down on me
Chasing, chasing me down, down on me
Don't, don't leave
Don't leave now
I'll just be your man
You can throw away the lease
Three bedroom walls past your blossomed trees
I stand all year long
Set me in cold night sleep
And I
Don't, don't leave
Don't
Tell me, tell me now
Tell me, tell me, tell me now
It's really hard to live
If I'm not around, I don't care
And it's as you can, as you can
I can't, I can't
If it's not as good as before
Darling, darling
Darling, darling
Darling, darling
Join me, join me now
