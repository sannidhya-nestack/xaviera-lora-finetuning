Lakes too deep, better not dive
Sky's too clear
Better not hide
Air's too chill
Better not breathe
And I'm too bad, better not meet
Better better, better never
Better better, better never
Better better, better never
Better better better never
Heels too high
Better not climb
Eyes too dark, better not see
Trees too dense, better not see
And I'm too bad, better not me
Better better, better never
Better better, better never
Better better, better never
Better better, better never
Better better, better never
Better better, better never
