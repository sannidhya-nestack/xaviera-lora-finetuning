I don't know, I don't care
I feel us touch in the air
Tonight
We were one, we are two
I see us touch in the stars
Tonight
I don't know, I don't care
I feel us touching the air tonight
We were one, we are two, I see us touching the stars tonight
(D-d-d-d-d-d-d)
(D-d-d-d-d-d-d)
(D-d-d-d-d-d-d)
(D-d-d-d-d-d-d)
(D-d-d-d-d-d-d)
(D-d-d-d-d-d)
Baby baby baby baby baby
We're almost there
We're almost there
Baby baby baby baby baby
I don't know, I don't care
Baby baby baby baby baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I don't know, I don't care
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
