Build me up to knock me down
You're still enough to keep me around
I wanna break through the other side
I wanna climb one brick at a time
Who knows just what we'll find
We are all of our own design
Rolling stone that built this home
Came tumbling down, came tumbling down
Side by side
We're standing so high
It came tumbling down
Built back up from the ground
Through the rubble I will love you every day
Find our path and pave the way
It's on another level and here to stay
But I can't find the words to say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Build it up, don't let me fall
I just can't get enough behind these walls
I wanna break through the other side
I wanna climb one brick at a time
Who knows just what we'll find
We are all on our own design
Rolling stone that built this home
Came tumblin' down
Came tumblin' down
Side by side
We're stacked so high
It came tumblin' down
Built back up from the ground
Through the rubble I will love you every day
Find our path and pave the way
It's on another level and here to stay
But I can't find the words to say, ooh
Rolling stone, that built this home
Came tumbling down, came tumbling down
Side by side, we're standing so high
It came tumbling down
Built back up from the ground
