Good evening, sir and madam.
Alright
I'll bring it in a moment
One shall not glorify a dish nobody ordered
The rules of the house should be observed at all times
But the greedy needs of the needy guests with eating disorders
Obliged me to serve my most requested crime
When paid up front with a currency machismo
I'll get you what you're asking for with just a short delay
Sophisticated aftertaste of a knuckle duster
Making absolutely sure you cannot complain
Ooh, justice is ready
Ooh, dinner is served
I'd rather be peaceful all of my days
But it has to come from both ways
Whenever you taunt me it won't be worthwhile
Violence is ugly just like your smile (smile, smile, smile)
Smile, smile, smile
Ooh, justice is ready (Really?)
Ooh, dinner is served
Ooh, justice is ready (Sure, here it is)
Ooh, dinner is served
