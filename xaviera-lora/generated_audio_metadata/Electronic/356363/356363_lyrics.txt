Could you fall underneath the city?
Could you fall on my mind?
Would you call thinking you're so pretty?
Would you call if I'm on your mind?
Wouldn't it be cool to rise above the city
Wouldn't it be cool to be by your side
Playing by the rules like pieces aren't fitting
Makes you look a fool we all play sometimes
We all play sometimes
Underneath the city
Right about now
All around the city
Right about now
Day turns into night
All around town
You're standing or you're sitting
All around town
Dark or light
If you figure out, you keep yourself from quitting
Then you figured out how to stay all night
I wish you'd show me how to get back underneath the city
I wish you'd show me how to make it feel so right
Make it feel so right
Underneath the city
Could you fall?
Underneath the city, could you fall?
On my mind, could you fall?
Underneath the city, could you fall?
On my mind
I wish you'd show me how
To get back underneath the city
I wish you'd show me how
To make it feel so right
Make it feel so right
Underneath the city
I don't need the city
