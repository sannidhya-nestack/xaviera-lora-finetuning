She's be, she's be, she's be dancing in the tub
She's be, she's be, she's be dancing in the tub
Hooked on you
Hook yourself on me tonight
Dancing in the dark
Dancing in the dark tonight
Step it out, step it up, step it right into my heart
Wanna take you dancing in the dark
Step it out, step it up, step it right into my heart
Shitty, titty, titty, dancing in the dark
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Hey, hey, hey, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
We'd be dancing in the dark, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Wanna dance, wanna dance, wanna dance, wanna dance with you
Bringing it in, holding it close, breaking it down, let it go
Bringing it in, holding it close, breaking it down, let it go
Let it go (let it let it let it go)
We'll be dancing, we'll be dancing
We'll be dancing, we'll be dancing
Up down on you
Hook yourself on me tonight
Dancing in the dark
Dancing in the dark tonight
Step it out, step it up
Step it right into my heart
Wanna take you dancing in the dark
Step it out, step it up
Step it right into my heart
Should be, should be, should be dancing in the dark
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Hey, hey, hey
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-uh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It'd be dancing in the dark
Hey, hey, hey, wanna dance, wanna dance, wanna dance, wanna dance with you
