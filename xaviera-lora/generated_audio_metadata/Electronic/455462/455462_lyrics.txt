You can help me, be my friend
I will love you
Till the end
I give you my word
If you give me your heart
Walk with me
To the darkness
I can teach you the names of the stars
One by one as they appear
Lying close on the cool dark grass
Ants and worms shed no tears
Shed no tears
Playing games dangerous games
Games of pleasure, games of pain
Games of promise, games of fate
Games of love
Kiss my soul, my love has accepted
Sleep in the water, hard and tempted
Drunken and naked, God desires
Games in a circle, no hands, no eyes
Death inspired by the day
Yellow paint and rockets racing
Adding up, taking away, split my arms
Playing games, dangerous games
Games of pleasure, games of pain
Games of promise, games of fate
Games of love
It was so easy, oh so easy
Sleeping below the window pane
Gathering fires in the morning
In the deep cover glade
She named names
She named them all
One by one as they appeared
Drunken and naked
In cool night air
Wake in the morning
All is over
Playing games
Dangerous games
Games of pleasure
Games of pain
Games of promise
Games of fate
Games of love
Playing games
Dangerous games
Games of pleasure
Games of pain
Games of promise
Games of fate
Games of love
