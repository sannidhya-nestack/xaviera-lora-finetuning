You may say you want me, but you can't ever have me
I'm heading back to the place where I'm from
You may say you've had me
But you have never known me
I'm headed back to where I'm born
And lives may change and people aren't the same
We head back to where we're from
And strange faces all collide
They're in our heads, that's where we hide
Can't figure right from wrong
I did it all before we're done
Can't connect the dots, we're seeing
Time to head back to our meaning
Time to head back home
To where we're from
You may say you saw me
But you have never found me
I'm heading back
To where I'm from
You may say you learned me
But you have never earned me
I'm heading back
To where I'm born
And lives may change and people aren't the same
We head back to where we're from
And strange faces are colliding
They're in our heads, that's where we hide
Can't figure right from wrong
I've did it all before, we're done
Can't connect the dots, we're seeing
Time to head back to our meaning
Time to head back home
To where we're from (from, from)
Time to head back home
Time to head back from
