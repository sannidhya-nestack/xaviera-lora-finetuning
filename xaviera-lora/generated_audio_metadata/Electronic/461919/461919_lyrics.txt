I could, I could, I could, I could, I could, I could
I could, I could, I could, I could be a super villain
You could be my main stress
We could kill all the civilians
Go and suck some henchmen
We could make a bomb attempt
Cook us up a super weapon
Hop a vent or blow a bomb
Rain death on all of them
We could make some beautiful evil
I'll be the devil you can be my angel
Superman, Batman they'll be unable
To stop our reign of beautiful evil
Do you like the carnivorous flowers I got for you?
Cause I got you a box of cyanide chocolate too
I am made this pair of baby seal boots
And I'm brand new laser based with point and shoot
We could make some beautiful evil
I'll be the devil, you can be my angel
Superman, Batman, they'll be unable
To stop our reign of beautiful evil
I love your nightgown
How you turn a sticky situation into a bloodbath
The way you purposefully stall your act
And how you walk around with an antennae strapped to your back
We could make some beautiful evil
I'll be the devil, you can be my angel
Superman, Batman, they'll be unable
To stop the rain, beautiful evil
We could make some beautiful evil
I'll be the devil, you can be my angel
Superman, Batman, they'll be unable
To stop our reign of beautiful evil
