I struggle on the road to evening
This is my time to breathe
I'm washing light and pounding headaches
'Til we drown in the evening haze
If our waves don't crash together
I won't vapor in the breeze
Can't stay in shade forever
I won't share your lonely weather
Because you know your way with me
Because you know your way with me
Through the dark, through the neon bleach
You know your way with me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You know your way with me
These veiled streets hold back confessions
Words too heavy to perceive
A midnight waltz of love and loathing
We're still dancing in this maze
If our waves don't crash together
I won't vapor in the breeze
Can't stay in the shade forever
I won't share your lonely weather
Because you're going away with me
Because you know your way with me
Through the dark, through the neon bleed
You know your way with me
You know your way with me
How
But you already knew how this ends (how this ends)
But you already knew how this ends (how this ends)
I struggle on the road to evening
This is my time to breathe
This is my time to breathe
This is my time to be
