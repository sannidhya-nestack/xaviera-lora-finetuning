So far away, I can't stay
It's all the same
It's all the same
Something new, something new for us
Time stops here, again
So far away, I can still see your face
I can still see your face
I can still see your face
I can't seem to think you're mine
I can't say I love you
Since you've been my love
Since you've been my love
