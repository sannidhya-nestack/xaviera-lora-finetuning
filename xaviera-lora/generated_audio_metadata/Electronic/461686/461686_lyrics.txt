Come follow me through the trees
You've got somewhere to go but nowhere to be
Take my hand, follow close
You're always on my mind and I hope
That you feel the way I do
It's hard as I try I can't stop thinking of you
I listen close if you tell me in dreams
Look in my eyes and tell me what it means
Being with you feels like home
Your voice makes me calm
I just want you to know
Being with you feels like home
How are you feeling today?
I just got what I want, I'm ready to play
Far from perfection, just where I am
And I love the way you don't give a damn
Come follow me through the trees
We've got somewhere to go but nowhere to be
I'll listen close if you tell me in dreams
Look in my eyes and tell me what it means
Being with you feels like home
Your voice makes me come
I just want you to know
Being with you feels like home
Being with you feels like home
Your voice makes me calm
I just want you to know
Being with you feels like home
I'll listen close if you tell me your dreams
Look in my eyes and tell me what it means
I just want you to know
Being with you feels like home
Being with you feels like home
