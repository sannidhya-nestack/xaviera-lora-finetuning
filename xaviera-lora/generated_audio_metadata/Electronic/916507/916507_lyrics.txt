I wanted to erase you
I wanted to et you
Brain is not in service
Head is under surface
I don't want to do this, oh oh
I need to be more patient
Let me be your patient
We can have a session, oh oh
Crushed mental strain
Quit playing games
Crushed mental strain
Quit playing games
I want to embrace you
But I should embrace you
Yeah, I should regret you, fool, oh-oh
But I can't ignore you
Though I do adore you
What can I do for you, oh-oh
I want to embrace you
But I should embrace you
Yeah, I should regret you, fool, oh-oh
But I can't ignore you
No, I do adore you
What can I do for you, oh-oh
I want to embrace you
But I should erase you
Yeah, I should break where you fool, oh-oh
But I can't ignore you
No, I do adore you
What can I do for you, oh-oh
