I want, I want, I want
Give me some more, get on the floor
Come on keep dancing, I'll show you up
I've been watching you from across the room
And I wish you weren't dancing by me
Yeah I'll give you a show, no one has to know
So babe I'm waiting right here
So give me some more, get on the floor
Come on, keep dancing, I'll show you what more
So get off your seat, I'll turn up the heat
The temperature's rising tonight and now I want, I want, I want
Baby don't be shy, there's no reason why
Let your body do the talking for you
Because I feel so hot, I'll make your body drop
You know I taste so sweet, so give me some more
Get on the floor
Come on, keep dancing, I'll show you what more
So get off your seat, I'll turn up the heat
The temperature's rising to ninety now
I want, I want, I want
Give me some more
Get on the floor
Come on keep dancing
I'll show you what more
So get off your seat
I'll turn up the heat
The temperature's rising to ninety now
I want, I want, I want
