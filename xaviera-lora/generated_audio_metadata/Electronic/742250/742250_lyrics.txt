So long is not the last
Summer just meant to cross our paths
It's a bad, it's a bad road
It's a bad romance
It's a bad girl
So love is meant to last, meant to last, meant to last, meant to last, meant to last, meant to last, meant to last, meant to last, meant to last, meant to last, meant to last, meant to last, meant to last, meant to last, meant to last, meant to last, meant to last, meant to last, meant to last
It's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad
It's the best of both worlds
