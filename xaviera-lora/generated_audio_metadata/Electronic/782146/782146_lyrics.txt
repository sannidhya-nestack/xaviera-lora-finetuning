My-my-my caddy (I can't be heard from)
You surprised me today
A box from Tiffany
And a dinner in LA
But last night, what a jerk
Seven texts you didn't see
Never called me after work, boy
I don't know just what to do sometimes
Went to a psychic, tried to read your mind
Look to the skies, I'm asking what to do
Out of view, me and you
Upside down
It never seemed to hit the ground
I'm in a freight train spinning round
Straight out of orbital speed of sound
We're flying upside down
I'm in my free fall
We're flying upside down
I'm in my free fall
Set to flirt at the club
Every girl that dances by I see your shoulders start to rub
But at night in my room
When we're breathing eye to eye it makes my heart go boom boom
I don't know just where we are right now
Guess I'm floating on a different world
Your arms around me and I'll never fall
Breaking down Newton's law
Upside down, it never seemed to hit the ground (I'm in a free fall)
Spinning round, straight out of orbital speed of sound (Upside down)
We're flying upside down (I'm in a free fall)
We're flying upside down
I'm in a free fall, I'm in a free fall, I'm in the free fall
And we don't ever have to fall, no
It's up to us after all
I'm never afraid to fall upside down
It never seemed to hit the ground
I'm never afraid to fall spinning round
Straight out of orbit, hold speed of sound
We're flying upside down
I'm never afraid to fall upside down
We're flying upside down
I, I, I'm in my free, free, free, free, free, free, my flying upside down
