Explode!
Well now the rock and twist a upload
With some brutal lyrics we lead a pin code
We coming in for the wrestle for a cup hold
So send villages out with the liquid toad
Where we go suffer world and we go step back
Say we go step back because we found the attack
Where rock and twist come there's no turning back
Say boom shaka shaka and everybody a feel that
Bad man
Listen up the bad man target
The man rocka him at the gate
Come inna the place when I walk in
Yes sell the world we go we dive in
Listen up the bad man target
The man rocka him at the gate
Listen up the bad man target
Listen up the bad man target
Bad man, bad bad bad bad bad man
Bad man, bad bad bad bad bad man
Bad man, bad bad bad bad bad man
Bad man, bad bad bad bad bad man
Bad man, bad bad bad bad bad man
Bad man, bad man, bad man, bad man, bad man bad man, bad man, bad man, bad man, bad man, bad man
