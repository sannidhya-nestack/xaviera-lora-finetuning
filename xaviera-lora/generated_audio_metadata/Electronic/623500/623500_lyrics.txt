Don't tell me what I can't do
Little engine that always knew
I'm tougher than nails, blazing rails
Pay attention where I be surprised
I won't compromise
You counted me out, let there be no doubt
I'm breaking glass
Never saw me coming, I'm a red bull rushing
Charge my way through your iron gates
Step aside'cause now you're mine
Never saw me coming, I'm a red bull rushing
Charge my way through your iron gates
Step aside'cause now you're mine
Make believe what you say
It's a price I have to pay
Against all odds the virus won
Underestimate what I can do
And believe me this is the truth
Against all odds I'm breaking the glass
Never saw me coming, I'm a red bull rushing
Charge my way through your iron gates
Step aside'cause now you're mine
Never saw me coming, I'm a red bull rushing
Charge my way through your iron gates
Step aside'cause now you're mine
'Cause now you're mine, you ran me over
Now I'm back on the attack
Never saw me coming, I'm a red bull rushing
Charge my way through your iron gate
Step aside'cause now you're mine
Never saw me coming, I'm a red bull rushing
Charge my way through your iron gate
Step aside'cause now you're mine
I, I, I, I, I, I, because now you're mine
