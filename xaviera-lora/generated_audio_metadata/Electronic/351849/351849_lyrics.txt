Raise your hands
To trace the distant skies
Breathe in life
Quiet your mind (I know you're me)
In the falling rain (we are the same)
Open your mind
Just one more time
These simple things
Fall away from me
What will come?
And what shall be
Your crystal eyes
Are all I have inside
Breathe in life, replace your fear
Breathe out pain, I am here
Quiet your mind, I know your name
In the falling rain, we are the same
Breathe in life, release your fear
Breathe out pain, I am here
Quiet your mind, I know you're me
In the falling rain, we are the same
We are the sea
