It's never ever been so hot
Is it for given reasons? No it's not
I'm getting ready and you are waiting for me
Is it love or just a longing?
Will it last until the morning
It's a mystery where the night will take us
Last night we found a red on your face
That we could make it
It's never ever been so hot
Is it for given reasons? No it's not
I'm getting ready and you are waiting for me
Is it love or just a longing?
Will it last until the morning
It's a mystery where the night will take us
Last time we met I read on your face
That we could make it
