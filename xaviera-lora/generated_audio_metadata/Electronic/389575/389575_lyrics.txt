Alone
What does it mean?
Does anyone really understand?
What can we do?
Where do we go?
What can we do
Where do we go
What can we do
Where do we go
Such pain and suffering
Can't be undone
No better so what's cut through me, be warned
Such pain and suffering
Can't be undone
No better so what's cut through me, be warned
Move
Lord, what does it mean?
Does anyone really understand?
What can we do, where do we go?
What can we do, where do we go?
What can we do, where do we go?
What can we do, where do we go?
What can we do? Where do we go?
What can we do? Where do we go?
