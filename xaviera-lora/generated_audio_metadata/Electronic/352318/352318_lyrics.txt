Yeah, I'm back again, my friend
The Rat and Rave
So let it begin, huh
When you think your mama trying to change
When she says, "That's enough, little fella"
You are half a spelling out
You ain't doing nothing gonna help the situation
Use your brain, kid
Don't you work her mouth
There is no dismissing what is missing
The world condition
It isn't what you choose to talk about
But you holler for a dollar
Got your bitches wearing collars
Like the hoes you used to love to talk about
Showtime's only about your show, yo (And here's the song I'm on)
Showtime's only about your show, yo (It's a real good show, yo)
Yo, enough of gangster glory
It's just the same old story
Your anger hasn't found the enemy
Yo, Bush chillin' on his ranch
Joggin' with his hands down his pants
That's what he calls domestic policy
Yo, wars, you know, Iraq, man, it cost so much
There's no more aid left for New Orleans
Exaggerated, inflated, outdated
Affluence is overstated, overrated
And all the hungry people out there waiting
Bush on the ranch from passing
But all you thinkin' about is you (gangsta)
Aw, son
Showtime, it's only about your show, yo
Showtime, it's always about your show, yo
Huh? Showtime, it's only about your show, yo
Gon' make me hoe
Gotta find a way to save the son of a K to do something to bring about change
And there's a problem when we got a whip of little cowboy holding the reins
Save Texas should open his arms to New Orleans
That's the smartest excuse for a president I ever seen
We was just republicans trying to undo all Bush senior shit
Not done yet, just holler "Remember New Orleans"
Pay our debts and get a new fuckin' president
It ain't done yet
Showtime, it's always about your show, yo, huh?
Showtime, it's only about your show, yo
Gonna make it, hoe (Let him breathe)
It's only about your show, yo
Showtime, gonna make it, hoe, huh?
Showtime, it's always about your show, yo
And here's the star of our show, star of our show, star of our show
