And my heart seems to be falling
To know your name
To know you face and heart
And I'll go on
Silent night, the other half
The other half
So there's no more
To the other half
I'm passing to the other half
I'll see you in five
(See you in my dreams) (See you in my dreams) (So desperate for you) (See you in my dreams) (See you in my dreams) (See you in my dreams)
Silent night, yeah
