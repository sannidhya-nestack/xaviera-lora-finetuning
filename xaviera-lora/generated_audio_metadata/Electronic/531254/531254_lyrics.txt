For you and me to be starting something new
This could last for all our lifetime
You can see what I'm seeing too
Let's stop wasting our time
This is the right time
Come take a walk with me now baby
This is the right time
It's only you and me now baby
This is the right time
For you and me to get together
You got no man, I got no woman
This must be the right time
For you and me to be starting something new
This could last for a lifetime
If you can see what I'm saying to you
Let's stop wasting our time
This is the right time
Come take a walk with me now baby
This is the right time
It's only you and me now baby
