We're at war, we're at war, we're at war, we're at war, we're at war, we're at war, we're at war, we're at war, we're at war, we're at war
You're not the one, you're not the one, you're not the one
You're not the one, you're not the one, you're not the one
You're not the one, you're not the one
Black walls, black walls, black walls, black walls
But I won't give up on you
