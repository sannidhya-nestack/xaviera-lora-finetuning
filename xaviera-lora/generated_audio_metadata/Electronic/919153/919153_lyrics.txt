See, see
Never let'em see you down
Never let'em see you drown
Oh, seeing the world through your eyes
I feel I've been there too
Oh, how I understand this light of mine
Hey, do you wanna let it wait?
Do you wanna let it go?
To have no fear, no fear (See, see)
Never keep it to yourself
Tell someone and never, never blame yourself (See, see)
'Cause your wide-eyed
With so much love in your heart
Your purity is all we see
Hey, do you wanna get away?
Do you wanna make'em dizzy?
To have no fear, no fear
I know it's hard
And I know it hurts
But you're stronger
Hey, do you wanna get away?
Do you wanna make'em disappear?
To have no fear, no fear
Hey, do you wanna get away?
Do you wanna make'em disappear?
To have no fear, no fear
