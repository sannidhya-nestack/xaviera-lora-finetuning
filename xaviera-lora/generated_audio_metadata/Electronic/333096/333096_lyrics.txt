Come on, come to me
Come, come on
Come on, come to me
Come on, come on, come on
Be your honey, honey
My love, my love, my love
Come along, come along to me
Memories close to me
Here we are
Close to me, in the air, dance to me
Come to me, to me
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
My love, my love, my love
Come home to me
My love, my love, my love
I do what you say, my love, in your destiny
I do what you do to me, I do what you say
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
