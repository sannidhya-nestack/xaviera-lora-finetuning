Turn on your TV, this is about me
Big chains on a rockin' A .B.
Everybody wanna know who's that guy
Everybody see him at live
Big boy chains up rockin' them jewels
Six of the fools are walkin' them dudes
Oh my God, I got that money
Big man chains up rockin' big money
Got your girl on bobby now
Big man can't un-cow me now
Everybody know it's a soul after I can get it good
Oh my god that ass a star
Oh my god he got that car
Can't beat everything on me
It's'cause I'm so so crazy, I'm
Woah
Walked in the room all eyes on me
So much guap I'm bringing the honeys
The guys looking at me like they wanna try me
Now don't get it twisted I keep it on me
Time is money and money don't wait for
So I gotta get to where I gotta go
Everybody wants to go to Hollywood
Where the shoppers be fast and money is all good
Life is a test so I be on key
Traveling through fast with lost reality
Everybody looks but what do they see
A young rich cat that look just like me
The money, the money, I'm driving for the money
I have to go back to speak with them, so
