I think it's time to say the truth
It's called attraction between me and you
Maybe I drink too much and waiting for your touch
But okay, this is such a Bianca thing to do
I keep on waiting and hesitating
The moment you'll be close
But baby take your time, the moment will soon come
When you will take me and hold me in your arms
And everything will be so fine
And everything will be so fine
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I don't know much more than your first name
But I might stick around'til I know everything
I like the new beginning, this bittersweet slow show
Sometimes the expectation is sweeter than love
When you smiled at me, I felt so many things
Like fear, emotions, love
I'm gonna take my time, reveal your mystery
It's simple, take your freedom, now you're given the key
And everything will be so fine
And everything will be so fine
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, La, la, la, la, la ,la
La, la, la, la, la, lala
