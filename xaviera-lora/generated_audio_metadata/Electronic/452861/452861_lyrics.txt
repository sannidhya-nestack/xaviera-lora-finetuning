I like, I like, I like the way you
I like, I like, I like the way you
I like the way your eyes hold the sea
Mmm, I like the way we dance, two, three
I like the way the faces fade
An ocean of people disappear
And there's the island of just you and me
there's nothing in between
Nothing in between us
Nothing in between you and me
I like the way there's nothing in between us
Nothing in between us
Nothing in between you and me
I like the way I'm overcome
By the magic in your touch
When you hold my hand
Oh honey you know that you hold my heart
I like the way we can't wait to get home
And close the doors to the world when outside sleeps
And it's cold
There's no end to where we can go
there's nothing in between us
Nothing in between us
Nothing in between you and me
I like, I like, I like you and me
I like, I like the way you do it, I like, I like, I like the way you do it
Nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing
there's nothing in between us
Nothing in between us
Nothing in between you and me
I like the way there's nothing in between us
Nothing in between us
Nothing in between you and me
There's nothing to where we can't go
