Can you imagine floating weightless
Like a satellite in the black sky
Weightless
Floating weightless
With no gravity
Can we dive into the galaxy
Float away deep into fantasy
Weightless like a satellite
Slow dance with the stars
Feeling weightless no matter where we are
Can you imagine floating weightless
Like satellites in the black sky
Weightless
Floating weightless
Follow stars tonight
Run away deep in a foreign light
Find oasis find paradise
Weightless like a satellite
Slow dance with the stars
Feeling weightless no matter where we are
Can you imagine floating weightless
Like satellite in the black sky
Weightless
Floating floating weightless
Feeling weightless
The skies are changing
Like diamonds raining
Floating like a satellite
Slow dance with the stars
Feeling weightless no matter where we are
Can you imagine floating weightless?
Like a satellite in the black sky
Weightless, floating weightless
