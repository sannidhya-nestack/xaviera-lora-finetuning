Red shoes, twisted metal, pornography
What do these things have to do with me?
God's there, he's right there
Cross hanging in the hazy air
See through, fleshy skulls
To curvy, dirty curls
Precious
Such
Self
Precious
Such
Self
Precious
Such
Self
Precious
Be a picture of your sister
Live the freedom meant for sinners
Fight the past into the future
Mourn your mother through her savior
Button the walls behind these eyes
Predict the wars with burning creatures
See the saintly smiling face
Scissors slice the truth away
Violent father watch me burn
Such self-pity
Such self-pity
Such self-pity
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'll be back, I'll be back, I'll be back
