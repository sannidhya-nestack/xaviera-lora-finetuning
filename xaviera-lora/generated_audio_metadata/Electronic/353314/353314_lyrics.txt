Welcome to my own existence, resistance is useless
All your efforts to react are fruitless and futile
Endless delorm just like the river Nile
Amazon are issued life sentences to juveniles
Your body feels numb, nowhere to run
Bleeding from the thumb, soak it with rum
The drummer drum, everybody form a single line
Everybody step along in time because it's costing more money with every rhyme
With bloodshot eyes, electric skies, everybody tries
Guilty feeling, felt it disguise
You can stick your fingers in the pies
Got em for listening, it's too surprised
Cause I've won a thing or two without a prize
Listen closely, I'll tell you about it mostly
In the darkness, my flow becoming ghostly
And blindly, you try to find me but never mind me
Remind me to put the lonely past behind me
Now my destiny awaits me
I try to reach it but the world seems to hate me
They always slate me, debate me, and lately
It seems impossible to work so no one rates me
It aggravates me, will anybody take me?
Slightly serious, my body clock awakes me
A mighty furious, I'm similar to most
I plant the seed but all I get is black rose
I plant the seed but all I get is black rose
They're concentrated with a group of black roses
I'm putting lotions but majority of roses
I got no friends so I know whom I foes this
I thought you knew because I never ever chose this
I'm barely coping in a mess and he knows this
I broke it open so I guess I better close this
And who am I just a guy near psychosis
I rule or die that's why I drink in heavy doses
I plant the seed but all I get is black roses
I plant the seed but all I get is black rope
Read the revelations
Then consider the destruction of a nation
Forsake the road, break the code, simulation
Of experiences warrant an evasion
Degradation of a stronghold
Children in the cold, but moms old
They show the stories that the bombs told, consoles
Ringing bells, dropping shells, rotten body smells
William Tells, Dante's live in hell
Break the spell if you can
I'd really die if it could save your clan
An average life for Joe is not enough for average man
It's inconceivable but then again believable
I must manipulate and make it irretrievable
To be the buff or get the horns
Packing thorns in my vengeance like a woman's scorn
Hatred is born alive from preconception
Mass deception and bad selection
What do we do we just await the resurrection
A mighty furious I'm similar to Moses
I plant the seed but all I get is black smoke
I plant the seed but all I get is black rope
