I'm going back to the past.
We're not alone
But God is with us
God's always with us
'Cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of you,'cause of I have to live a lie
Lost my light
Goes over
Goes over
My life's just a waste
Goes over
Goes over
Goes over
Goes over
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,
Not so long,'cause of you
