Coming to your city you'll be feeling the heat
I'll be in the places that I ought to be
In the streets, in the stages where I get that cream
Back to the studio where the magic begins
Then I make a video for the world to see
Hip-hop lives, I'm the symbol of it
Playing my hits while I'm pushing my weight, oh yeah
I'm the pimp, you can see it from the veins
Yeah that's right, I'm gonna rock all night
I'm the man of the party, playa what's up now
Don't get mad if I'm shining better with your turn
Before you try to get a cake better
If you thinking it's a game you gon' have to learn
I'ma tear you to your face you ain't got no chance
I'ma take my stand I'ma take your face
when they know I'm in the place you ain't got no chance
Believe in yourself otherwise you just a jerk
I believe in myself to get the cash I got the swag
You want the cash the girls and the class
You can get it but first you gotta get a hidden item mine
Everybody got their style somewhere up in the sky
All you gotta do is find it'cause I find mine
Own style when I rap into the crowd
That's why I rap like that original from the hat
Believe in yourself otherwise you just a jerk
I believe in myself to get the cash I got the swag
I got the swag, you want the cash, the girls and the cash
You can get it but fast, you gotta get it in out your mind
Everybody got their style, somewhere up in the sky
All you gotta do is find it cause I find mine
Old style when I rap into the crowd, that's why I rap like that original from the heart
Barking with the best smile
Suckers spread a red smile
You don't wanna piss now
Make you lose your breath
I'm chilling in the crib
Feeling on a beat
Gotta get the money
So I'm filling up my script
Head banging up and down
Left to right
Rhymes flowing to the path
I've got it in my lab
Aye, pretty much
Yeah that's what it's all about
Listen to the pile of words
That's coming out my mouth
Music in my ears
Everyday I leave the house
Always on the grind
Writing rhymes ahead of time
It's a must I gotta shine
So bright so hard
Better recognize before your eyes get blind
If you cross that line
Imma take your ass out
Not today nah
I mean yo my day nah
Baby you so wild babba
So I'm gonna eat your liver
With the rhymes I deliver
Please don't be a non believer
Legit banging up and down
Left to right, rhymes flowing through the path
I got it in my lap, ay, play the magic
Yeah, that's what it's all about
Listen to the pile of words that's coming out my mouth
Music in my ears everyday I leave the house
Always on the grind, writing rhymes ahead of time
It's a must I gotta shine so bright so hard
Better recognize before your eyes get blind
If you're cleaving yourself otherwise you just a jerk
I believe in myself to get the cash I gotta sweat
You want the cash, the girls and the cars
You can get it but first you gotta get it hidden out your mind
Everybody got their star somewhere up in the sky
All you gotta do is find it'cause I find mine
Own style when I rap into the crowd
That's why I rap like that original from the heart
