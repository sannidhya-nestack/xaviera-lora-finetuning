I'm still here
And when the day comes
That my life's lived for
I'm the last live ball
And when the day comes
And things turn around
I'm the last live ball
But it didn't touch ground
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
And when the day comes
I'm the last live ball
