Reached my full height
It's a wonder that I haven't grown at all
Got no advice
Timeless words to the wise to elevate my fall
I'm still this bright
Holding grudges like stocks for the monster hall
Spoken my lines
Now I'm pacing off stage for the curtain call
I am lost
In this
I am hot
Moments
Promises
I am my moment
Promised
I am wise
In this moment I am promised, I am mine
In this moment I am promised, I am wise
In this moment I am promised I am mine
In this moment I am promised I am mine
