I said I'm taking over everything you've ever done
You told me once or twice but I can't remember which one
Your shades are leather
You look pretty together for a girl with a tongue in her cheek
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
God only knows my shoe size and I
And I'll cry under these blue skies
God only knows my shoe size and I
And I'll cry under these blue skies
God only knows my shoe size and I, and I'll cry under these blue skies
God only knows my shoe size and I, and i'll cry under these blue skies
Never more than a stone's throw away
I told you we were cool but that was yesterday
All we meant was delight
I wish you could've stayed for just one more night
God only knows my shoe size and I
And I'll cry under these blue skies
God only knows my shoe size and I
And I'll cry under these blue skies
God only knows my shoe size enough
And I'll cry under these blue skies
God only knows my shoe size enough
And I'll cry under these blue skies
God only knows my shoe size and I, and I'll cry under these blue skies
God only knows my shoe size and I, and cry under these blue skies
God only knows my shoe size and I, and I'll cry under these blue skies
God only knows my shoe size and I, and i'll cry under these blue skies
