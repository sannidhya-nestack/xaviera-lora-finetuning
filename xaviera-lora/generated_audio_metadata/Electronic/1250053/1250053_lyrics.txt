Morning light, it breaks, shines upon your face
In your eyes I see, all the world can be
Laughter in, the breeze, soft whispers in trees
There's a glow so bright, in the sweet sunlight
A sweet smile, could save a thousand lives
Her sweet smile like summer's night
When she looks my way all my fears just sway
In her joy I find peace that's so divine
Stars begin to fade she's my serenade
In her heart I know where true love can grow
A sweet song could save a thousand lives
A sweet song like a summer's night
Her sweet smile could save a thousand lives
Her sweet smile like a summer's night
