Tell me, tell me, tell me now
Tell me, tell me, tell me now
I'll try to find it out
You dance to the rhythm of my heart
You can't pretend that you got shit to do
I can't, I can't, it's all because of love
I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone,"I
I can't be alone
I see you, man
You can fly, please
See a vulture runs past you
Blossom trees, I send all your letters
Send me a cold night sleep
You do your heart to me
And I know you like it
Oh, it's okay, it's okay
I can't, I can't, it's okay to love the lonely
I'm so lonely
Don't leave us alone, don't leave us alone, don't leave us alone
Ja-ja-ja-ja-ja-ja-ja
E-e-e-e-e-e-a
