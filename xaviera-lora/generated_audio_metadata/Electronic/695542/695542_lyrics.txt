For the girls down south now
Gone girl let me see you get down
Let me see you get wild
For the fellas that's rock now
We in the place cause it's time to party
Have a little fun and get a little naughty
Let's et about the nine to five
And put us out of work to the day to day grind
Back to the original program
Full full beaks, alcoholic drinks
Waiting all week just to hit the club
See the underground fam and spread the love
That's L-O-V-E
Come and see me, the K-double-D on the M-I-C
I do this every night for my peoples indeed
Cause we the house nation'bout to keep the music funky
Oh boy let me see you get
Gone boy let me see you get
Gone boy let me see you get

Waiting on me just to hit the club
See the underground fam, express the love
That's L-O-V-E
Come and see me, the K-double-D on the M-I-C
