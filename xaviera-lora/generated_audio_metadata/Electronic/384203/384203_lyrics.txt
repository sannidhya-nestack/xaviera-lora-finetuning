Morning after leaving master
Great tomorrow comes the view for me
Swinging cradles watch the water
Health no matter faint tomorrow scream only laughter
Room in matter
Clean disaster
Change the moral brain
Right direction
Save the master
Molding manners
Now is the time to say
We live in our dimensions
We need no one who'll create for us
Only they own the faded meadows
Chains often fall on rummins in the grass
After
Leaving master home
For the laughter
Moving back to
(beep)
Morning after
Leaving master
Pre-tomorrow
Close the view for me
Swinging cradles
Watch the water
Dance more matter
Faint tomorrow scream
Only laughter
Change tomorrow, bring right direction
Save the master, more it matters
Now is the time to save
