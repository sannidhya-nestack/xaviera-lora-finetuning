I know where you and I always go
Under the abstract I know nothing
The city circles around the lake
These are words
These are words
These are the words
The words of a stranger
If you need any information
I am its creator
I am the illustration
This place is a prison you have to get out
Don't let the skies deceive you because the rain will still come down
This place is a prison you have to get out
Don't let the skies deceive you because the rain will still come down
It's a shame we always meet
These city limits are inch and feet
It brings you close to me
These are words, words of heart
These are words, words from you
These are the words, words you hear
The words of a stranger
This place is a cruise line you have to get on
Don't let the skies deceive you because the rain will still come down
This place is a cruise line you have to get on
Don't let the sky deceive you
Because the rain will still come down
It's a shame you can't help but live
Then again, who does?
These are words, words of a stranger
These are words, words of a stranger
These are the words, words of a stranger
The words of a stranger
These are the words of a stranger (these are the words of a stranger)
These are the words of a stranger (these are the words of a stranger)
The words of a stranger
These are the words of a stranger (these are words of a stranger)
These are the words of a stranger (these are the words of a stranger)
These are the words, the words we give, the words of a stranger
