We're burning down, we're burning, burning
Fire's burning all around
Ashes falling to the ground
Someone save me, set me free
The smoke it settles on my skin
Don't play with fire, you'll never win
Someone save me, help me breathe
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're burning down
Fire spreading everywhere
I feel we're running out of air
Someone save me, set me free
This love was cursed long ago
It never had the chance to grow
Someone save me, help me breathe
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're burning
We're burning
Burning
We're burning
We're burning down
We're burning
We're burning
Burning
We're burning
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're burning
We're burning
