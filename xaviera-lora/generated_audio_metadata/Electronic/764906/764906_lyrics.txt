I'm breaking in the back of the building like
I pay high taxes get meat from the butcher
I only want mustard on my frankfurter
I'm not a pusher yo I won't do that
Got my boombox like John Cusack
Lick my two sacks and play my skin food
Give me a butt kiss on the ones and twos
We take the game back like making 8 tracks
Where's the snakes at we rake the grass
Take it slow bro don't get your hopes up
You need more help than just mine and Oprah's
I could provide you with a guide and checkbook
But Ron might go ahead and take your textbook
We're not impressed with many famous rappers
Or anyone famous for that matter
I guess that's why we're just not too worried
We bust a ghostwriter like Bill Murray
Spring, summer, fall
Better call Saul
Pet a tall dog getting all involved
Saturday the draw
Seeing all stars
Being all bars
Gotta get in your car
Butterball bird, the butterball joke
No brain, no soul, all white, no yolk
We all tall folk, my man Adolfo
Swing like an all-pro, Dov Longquan
Played for the dolphins, shout to Allset
Pry up the nails in your coffin
Aw shit, fortified forfeit, Jew tree
Nah, fortified more hits, storm in the back door
I'm in charge of this building, you can say it's all mine
I'm taking it back, one piece at a time
I'm in charge of this building, can't steal my shine
We're building it up, one brick at a time
Smoke weed when they eating all the entrees
Over there be careful, I got the bomb plate
Long hair, don't don't care
Okay, wave your hair, wave to the front, don't care, okay, wave your hair
Wave to the front, don't care, okay, wave your hair
You got the go, got the green light
You ought to know it's all real life
Can't stop the flow, you know it feel right
You got the go, got the green light
You got the go, got the green light
You ought to know it's all real life
Can't stop the flow, you know it feel right
You got the go, got the green light
