I release you.
Here, here, here, here it is, here, here
Illusion
Illusion, illusion, illusion
Illusion, illusion
It's an illusion
It's not real
You're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing
You're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing, you're missing
Meet me there
Elysium fields, Elysium fields, Elysium fields
You are here, you are here, you are here, you are here, you are here, you are here, you are here, you are here, you are here, you are here, you are here, you are here
You're beautiful, you're beautiful, you're beautiful, you're beautiful
Elysium
We are here, it is
Elysium
We are here, this is now
It's all an illusion, it's not real
Illusion, illusion
(Yahweh)
You are here, you are here, you are here, you are here
Elysium to me, Elysium
We are here
And this here
Feels
Meet me there
