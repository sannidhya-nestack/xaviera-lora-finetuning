Mash up, let the DJ spin it
Yeah, you know this one's wicked
Nadia B Love, from me to you
I gotta big up my DJs for this one
Mash up, let the DJ spin it
Push the limit
Push the limit
Let the DJ spin it
Push the limit, push it good
Doesn't take a genius
To find lots of busses
Spacing Vegas
You can't be serious
Rocking a limo, leaving in a bus, what?
Don't take no moves, ah
Play a part in a screenplay acting bizarre
Set your camera on
Who do you think you are in a rental car, what?
Push the limit
Tell me who you are
Look at your reflection
Two steps way too far
Say it, push the limit
I'm pushin' the limit
But I'ma say respect yourself
No matter who you are
Keep on and on (push the limit'cause she good)
It doesn't take a fantasy
Satisfy what your mind really wants to be
A little simplicity
ABC
It's now that you're me, yeah
It's a miracle, oh
Come on now people them sayers they're'bout to give up on you
Offended by the lyrical, man don't get vexed
Push the limit
Tell me who you are, yeah
Now look at your reflection
Two steps, way to far, say it
Push the limit
Pushin' the limit
Get mama serious, back yourself
No matter who you are, keep on
My shop, let the DJ spin it
Rockin' the mic, pushin' the limit
Gotta keep on
My shop, let the DJ spin it
Ain't no half-steppin' holiday
Drinkin' rum
Sunshine above, sand below
Oh, look at me, I'm happy now
So many places to go, oh, I say
Push a limit, tell me who you are
Look at your reflection, two steps way too far, ah
Push a limit, push a limit, yeah (Oh, you say respect yourself)
Respect yourself
Don't take no seven-eight
What a sorry soundtrack representin' me
It's no mystery
ABC
Sing with me, my people all around (we hear you)
You'll find me where my heart's at
My shop, let the DJ spin it
I'm in it to win it, so push up the limit, come on now (push up the limit)
Just tell me who you are now (come on, I'll catch your reflection)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Say it, push the limit)
Pushin' the limit
Mama said respect yourself
No matter who you are (Say it)
It doesn't take a genius
To find Laszlo Basis stays in Vegas
It doesn't take a genius (It don't take no genius) (Say it, push the limit)
Pushin' the limit, yeah (pushin' the limit)
Got to push the limit, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, pushin' the limit, yeah (pushin', pushin' the limit)
Mama said to push it'cause, hey (pushin' the limit)
Sayin', pushin' the limit, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (pushin' the limit)
My shop let the DJ spin it
Pushin' the limit, yeah, yeah, yeah
Rock on with me, rock on with me, let the DJ spin it
Baby baby baby baby baby
Rock on with me, rock on with me I say
Rock on with me, rock on with me, rock on with me I say
Push the limit push it
