Took the train across the mountain
Wanted to see what was under the sky
Pulled my heart out like some kind of fountain
Just to search for the reason why
You gotta see it for yourself
Kinda wonderful, ooh
Gotta see it for yourself
Kinda wonderful, ooh
Seems I gave up happiness
To see what's under my smile
The truth I just can't suppress
Saved by sugar smile
Gotta see it for yourself
Something kinda wonderful
Gotta see it for yourself
Something kinda wonderful
Gotta see it for yourself, it's lookin' kinda wonderful
Gotta see it for yourself, it's lookin' kinda wonderful
