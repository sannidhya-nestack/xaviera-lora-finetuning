So much road, we are still far from where we belong
Here you are, holding us back
We're burning the page we drew yesterday
You're stuck on the fence, I'm over it
We aren't combined, the lines of promise have been torn apart
I've been here before, disguising mistakes with a compromise
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I've been waiting so long
And maybe I hold on to a fading dream
All I want is for you to take it on yourself
Can't you see we're not the same
Stop wasting your breath with empty words
We are into mine
But lies and promises are torn apart
I've been here before
Disguised in mistakes we will compromise
I've been waiting so long
And maybe I'd hold you to a faded dream
We aren't too much
Aren't too much
I must learn to take shelter from the waves you make
In the end I've come undone
We are into mines, the lies and promises were torn apart
I've been here before, discussing mistakes with a compromise
We are into mines, the lies and promises were torn apart
I've been here before, discussing mistakes with a compromise
Ooh, are you mine? (Are you mine?)
I've been waiting so long
And maybe I'd hold onto a better dream
Are you mine?
