Never, never, never, never, never, never, never
Being out of love but one stays
No matter how many times I've walked away
Just like those old love notes
Where the feelings were just words we wrote
No point in sleeping when the fear runs deep
I'm too emotional your love I must keep
I'm not afraid of falling when I'm with you my darling
But when you walk away the fear tends to stay
And I can't slow down my hands start to shake
The thought of losing you is more than I can take
I'm not afraid of falling when I'm with you my darling
When you walk away the fear tends to stay
And I can't slow down my hands start to shake
The thought of losing you is more than I can take
I will never never never feel this way again, whoa
Oh no
I will never, never, never feel this way again, oh no
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never
Never, never, never, never, never, never
We had our ups and downs
Still I need you around
You make it easier for me to touch the ground
Just like the old days, young and carefree
I never second guess when you are next to me
No point in sleeping when the fear keeps me awake
I need you here with me and I'll be okay
I'm not afraid of falling when I'm with you my darling
But when you walk away the fear tends to stay
And I can't slow down my hands start to shake
The thought of losing you is more than I can take
I'm not afraid of falling when I'm with you my darling
When you walk away the fear tends to stay
And I can't slow down my hands start to shake
The thought of losing you is more than I can take
I will never never never feel this way again
Whoa oh no
I will never, never, never feel this way again, oh no
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never
Whoa
Think I could lose you
Think I could let go
But I can't remove you'cause
Fear I don't show since
I can't lose you
I can't let go
I should remove you but
I will never, never, never feel this way again, whoa, oh no
I will never, never, never feel this way again, whoa, oh no
I will never, never, never feel this way again, whoa, oh no
I will never, never, never feel this way again, no, no, oh
