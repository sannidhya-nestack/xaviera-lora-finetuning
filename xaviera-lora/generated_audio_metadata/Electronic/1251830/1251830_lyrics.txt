In the dead of night, I find my voice
Where the darkness reigns, my creativity makes sound noise
I embrace the silence and let my spirit roam free
My music is my escape, my sexuality
In the dead of night, I find my voice
Where the darkness reigns, my creativity makes some noise
I embrace the silence and let my spirit roam free
My music is my escape, my sanctuary
I arise from the depths of my soul
Where the light and the dark collide
My melodies are born from the night
And my lyrics are the secrets I can't hide
My guitar is my weapon
My voice is my spell
I weave a realm of sound
That echoes through the hell
My songs and my confessions
My fears and my desires
In the stillness of the night
I find my truest fires
I am light from the depths of my soul
Where the light and the dark collide
My melodies are born from the night
And my lyrics are the secrets I can't hide
My guitar is the weapon
My voice is my spell
I weave a web of sound
That echoes through the hell
My songs are my confessions
My fears and my desires
In the stillness of the night
I find my truest fires
I arise from the depths of my soul
Where the light and the dark collide
My melodies are born from the night
And my lyrics are the secrets I can't hide
I arise from the depths of my soul
Where the light and the dark collide
My letter rhymes is a point from the night
And my lyrics are the secrets I can't hide
