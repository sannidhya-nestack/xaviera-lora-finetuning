You're so kind
You're so sweet
I'm inclined to sweep you right off your feet
You may blush
But it's true, you deserve the best and I deserve to give it to you
To that end, I've the means
Born of years perfecting intricate schemes
If it works out this once
We'll be sipping margaritas in a matter of months
Is it risky? Maybe
Is it legal? Maybe not
When your middle name is danger
There's no room for second thoughts
If they catch me it's game over
If they don't then we're home free
Is it theft?
Well not quite
Just financial slight of hand when done right
Take a look
In the garage, it's equipped for simple hacking up to espionage
I'm discreet, I'm covert, and I promise that no one will get hurt
I've said all that I dare
To protect us both from jeopardy, I better stop there
Is it risky? Maybe
Is it legal? Maybe not
When your middle name is danger
There's no room for second thoughts
If they catch me it's game over
If they don't then we're home free
It's too late to turn back now
And high time to disappear
Our troubles will soon be past
So think of me fondly dear
Is it risky? Maybe
Is it legal? Maybe not
When your middle name is danger
There's no room for second thoughts
If they catch me it's game over
If they don't then we're home free
If by some unlikely chance I don't live to see this through
Remember me with a smile I did all of it for you
