Good day, good day, good day, good day
Good, good, good, good, good, good day
It's gonna be a good, good, good, good, good day
Good, good, good, good, good, good day
It's gonna be a good, good, good good, good day
Sunny skies
Not a chance of rain, the birds are singing passing by, the clouds just fade away
Can't stop smiling when you're around, you've got me walking ten feet off the ground
And you're the only one for me, you make me wanna sing
It's gonna be a good, good, good, good, good, good day
Today is gonna be a good, good day
The sun is out, the sky is blue
It's all because of you and me together on a good day (good day, good day)
In the park
See the children play
Not a care I wonder why
So happy happy on a perfect day
A Kodak moment that's frozen time
I love this picture with your hand in mine
You're the only girl for me
You take my breath away
It's gonna be a good, good, good, good, good, good day
Today is gonna be a good, good day
And the sun is out, the sky is blue
And all I wanna do is be together
What a good day
Sunny skies, not a chance of rain
Girl I wanna be with you, girl I wanna be with you, girl I wanna be with you
Only gonna be with you
It's gonna be a good good good good good day
Today is gonna be a good good day
The sun is out, the sky is blue, and all I wanna do
Is gotta be a good good good good good day
Today is gonna be a good good day
The sun is out, the sky is blue, and all I wanna do
Is all because of you
We'll always be together, what a good day
