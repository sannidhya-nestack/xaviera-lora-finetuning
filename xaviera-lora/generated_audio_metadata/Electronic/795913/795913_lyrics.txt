Got drunk with my friends, it was Wednesday night, June 6
I knew they had work
My mind is simple when you're young, it was kinda stupid but really fun
I bet they regret it
But tonight
You're gone and it's close to dawn
Why is it that we need a special occasion
To feel love in a child in a song
See us in ten years I can't believe it took twenty beers just to finally hit the wall
But tonight you're gone and it's close to dawn
We've been through just about everything
So let's have some fun
I know that you would take a bullet for me
Still have fun
But tonight we're still young
Some days it takes time for there to be a moment to find
That we must be honest
I hope that you understand that it
Wasn't really what I had planned
You're still the one I can trust
But tonight
You're gone and it's close to dawn
We've been through just about everything, so it's
I know that you would take a vote for me
Still have won
But tonight we're still
We've been through just about everything so
I know that you would take a bullet for me
Still have one
But tonight we're still young
Still young
Still young
Still young
Still young
Still young
