The creep is on the making
The hunt has dawned awake
So slowly taunt the vagrant
And twist your heart to break
Won't someone stop the moaning
Of oil too black to paint
White kept till Tuesday
The flowers already on the grave
Silver tears never go away
Don't hold me back, I'm coming
Wake up, it's not too late
He can't be gone so early
What's left of me today
Go away
Higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher
Ghost is on the mantle
So close and yet so far
I hope you see me lonely
Never go away
Never go away
