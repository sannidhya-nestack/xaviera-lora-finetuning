Here comes the demon
She's looking sharp and she hypnotizes me
She is control, she is religion
She is the blue night time glow
She wants to tell me what I'm thinking
She says "Free"
We are the Genesis
And I'm just like you
Try, do what you want to
Destroy the death machine and do your part
Try, do what you want to
There's something waiting for the fatal heart
Here comes the demon
She's in your mind and she makes you feel afraid
She is abuse, she is perception
She is the altar where you pray
She needs to show you all the dying
She says the world is what you see
And you believe her and she deceives
And you are just like me (Strike)
Do what you wanna do
Destroy the death machine and do your part (Strike)
What do you wanna do?
There's something waiting for the fate of hearts (Strike)
There's something we all know
Play for the end you've got to make your mark
Do what you gotta do, there's something waiting for you in the dark
Strike! Do what you wanna do
Destroy the death machine and do your part
Strike! What do you wanna do?
There's something waiting for the fate of hearts
Strike! There's something we all know
Before the end you've got to make your mark
Strike! Do what you gotta do
There's something waiting for you in the dark
