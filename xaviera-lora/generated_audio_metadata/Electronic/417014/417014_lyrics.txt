You're the one I'm thinking'bout, you're the one I'm thinking'bout, you're the one I'm thinking'bout every night
You're the one I'm thinking'bout every night
You're the one I'm thinking'bout every night
You're the one I'm thinking'bout every night
You're the one I'm thinking'bout every night
You're the one I'm thinking'bout every night
You're the one I'm thinking'bout every night
You're the one
Can't control my feelings'cause they just ain't right
You're the one I'm thinking'bout every night
Bankage on my, bankage on my, bankage on my, bankage on my, bankage on my feelings'cause it just ain't right
Told the one I'm thinking'bout every night
