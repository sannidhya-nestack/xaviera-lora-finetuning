Morning after, leaving master
Great tomorrow, close the view for me
Swinging cradles, watch the water
Else no matter, faint tomorrow scream
Only laughter
Roaming matter
Clean disaster
Change the moral brain
Right direction
Save the master
Molding manners
Now is the time to say
We live in our dimensions
We need no more create flowers
Only day on the faded meadows
Tears of the fallen were rinsed in the grass
After
Leaving master
Born
Cold little after
Moving back to
[Silence]
Waning after bleeding master
Grip tomorrow close the view for me
Swinging cradles watch the water
Dance moment, faint to mother's scream
Only laughter, blood
Disaster changed the moral brain
Right direction saved the master
More demands now is the time to say
