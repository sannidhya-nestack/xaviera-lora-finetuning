Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
It's over, now the fantasy is dripping
Like a chemical reaction
Gone wrong, I'm done, so long
It's over, now the scent of you is fading
From my clothes and on my pillow, my love
For you has gone so wrong
There'll be one to spill the water
There'll be one of us instead
There'll be one of you behind me
There'll be one that's in my head
There'll be one of you that never left
And one of you that's dead
And I'm alone in my soul
And there's no room for you no more
There'll be one, one of us to let go
I hope you know, sorrow
It's over, hope you run into your hero
She's a diamond by the bar
Your love is an empire
In the backseat of your car
I'm not your victim
Your poison got my guts
My mama said I'm better
And she's finally right for once
I see all the colors of my lovers fall on my head
There'll be one to steal the blankets
There'll be one to drink the wine
(There'll be a world) that one of us is breaking
(There'll be a world) that one of us is low
That one of us is trying to ive
The one we used to love
Now it's over
The chapter is ending
It's over
My love for you has ended
