Morning after, leaving master
Great tomorrow, close the view for me
Swinging cradles, watch the water
Health no matter, faint to mother's grave
Only laughter
Roaming matter
Clean disaster
Change the moral grain
Right direction
Save the master
Molding manners
Now is the time to say
We live in our dimensions
We need no one who creates for us
Only they own the faded meadows
Chase after fallen ruins in the grass
After
Leaving master
Home
Only laughter
Home
Moving back to
Home
[Silence]
Mourning after bleeding master
Bleed tomorrow
Close the view for me
Swinging cradles
Watch the water
Dance no matter
Faint to mother's scream
Only laughter
Bleed tomorrow
Disaster changed the moral brain
Right direction saved the master
More than matters now is the time to say
