You thought I was complacent
Like my dope was an understatement
But for real you don't wanna face it
We hot like the summer blazing
Now look at you stuck in a pavement man
Cause everything I done's amazing
Just one step up from the basement
And now everything I brought you chasing
I won't be out through space
I guess that's what the others thinking
Thinking that I'm not mean
I blame that on the drugs you're taking
All day I cook in the kitchen
I don't need my mother's apron
Listen we up for Nathan
Uh yeah
So let me slow it down
So you can feel me
Then I speed it back up
As I move the invasion
You can move this building
Turn me up all the way to the top
When I get it I'ma spit it and I aim for the sky
I'ma give you what you need
Everything that you want
Everything else save for the pie
Y'all wanna go cause I aim for the sky
Seatbelt on in the lane that I ride
Bam back up open so you might as well jump on
Cause um it'd be a shame if you not
Look I don't really care
Y'all can kiss my ring
Everybody looking how I did my thing
So if you really want it
I'ma give it to you right now
Lookin how I kick my gang
Gun
I get involved, I hold it down
You get me going, watch me go, I go to town
All the boys wanna get me low
Got'em all looking on their tippy toes
So anybody wanna know anything about me?
Well I got a big ego
There's nothing you can say, there's nothing you can do
It's all about me, and not about you
All the boys wanna get me low
Got'em all looking on their tippy toes
So anybody wanna know anything about me?
Well I got a big ego
Go ahead, open your eyes, nah nah don't be so surprised
Feel like my is oversized, I think I might pulverize
Anybody comin' at me, y'all better know better get a plan B
Can't go to the toe with a bigger stampede
Now everybody froze, they lookin' at me, they lookin' at me
Y'all see it's gettin' ugly, but it's so lovely
You say you wanna get me, well thank you for thinkin' of me
But see I'm out of reach, at the table about to feast
Tell me who you know who was wildest meet
It ain't really hard, y'all seen I'm with it
See me where I spit, only means I get it
You ain't gotta see what I bring by
I just show up to the show when they think I did it
And on top of that, it's written across my face
And if I'm gone for a couple months, they think I lost my taste
But it's all good, love me now, love me later
Love me forever because we players
Got what you need, that money maker
Tastes so good, it must be the flavor
Break you down, it's corret
It's liberal inside your head
You'll et about what you said
You said, you was sayin'
I get involved, I hold it down
You get me going, watch me go, I go to town, uh
All the boys wanna get me low
Got'em all looking on they tippy toes
So anybody wanna know anything about me?
Well, I got a big ego
There's nothing you can say, there's nothing you can do
It's all about me and not about you
All the boys wanna get me low
Got'em all looking on they tippy toes
So anybody wanna know anything about me?
Well, I got a big ego
I get involved, I hold it down
You get me going, watch me go, I go to town, uh
All the boys wanna get me low
Got'em all looking on they tippy toes
So anybody wanna know anything about me?
Well, I got a big ego
There's nothing you can say, there's nothing you can do
It's all about me and not about you
All the boys wanna get me low
Got'em all looking on they tippy toes
So anybody wanna know anything about me?
Well, I got a big ego
