Thinking about a nice cloudy day, rollercoasters made us be happy, in the dark we kiss so suddenly, and it ended just unexpectedly.

New deep blue sky
New deep blue sky
Deep blue sky, I'm flying away, how I know I
Deep blue sky, I'm flying away, how I know I
Fly away
See the sun shining down on me
Fly away
Watch the deep blue sky fade away
Fly away into the city light of the sun
The sun's setting everyday
Sun's setting everyday
Fly away into the big city
Pick a cloud, step on it and drift to space
Until you find you dreamt of space
Fly away, fly away, gotta fly away
Got to fly away
You've got to fly away
Got to fly away
Got to fly away
You've got to fly away
Got to fly away
Got to fly away
Got to fly away
Got to fly away
Got to fly away
Oh yes, deep blue sky
Deep blue sky
Thinking about a nice cloudy day
Rollercoasters made us be happy
In the dark we kissed so suddenly
And it ended just unexpectedly
Thinking about a nice cloudy day
Rollercoasters made us be happy
In the dark we kissed so suddenly
And it ended just unexpectedly
Oh yes, we blew sky
Got to fly away, got to fly away
You've got to fly away, got to fly away
Got to fly away
You've got to fly away, got to fly away
Got to fly away
Got to fly away
Got to fly away
Got to fly away
Got got got got got got got got got got got got
Deep blue sky, I'm flying away, I wonder why
Deep blue sky, I'm flying away, I wonder why
Fly away
See the sunshine in your army
Fly away
Watch the deep blue sky fade away
Fly away
Flying through the silhouette of the sun (of the sun)
Sun setting everyday (sun setting everyday)
Sun setting everyday (sun setting everyday)
Fly away into the big city
Pick a cloud, step on it and drift
Live to space until you find you dreamt of place
Fly away, fly away until you find you dreamt of place
Fly away, fly away
