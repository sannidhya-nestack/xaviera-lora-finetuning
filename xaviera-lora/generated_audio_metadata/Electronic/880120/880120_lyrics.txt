Kill this chain
Kill this chain
You trade dignity for a feeling of unity
You need faces of acceptance
But the pressure keeps on growing
This unrelenting oppression won't go away
Won't go away
Keep pushing, pushing
Keep blowing off steam
Oh we can't stop'til something kills this machine
Kill this machine
Kill this machine
It keeps on ringing in my ears
Kill this machine
It keeps on ringing in my ears
This unrelenting oppression won't go away
But don't do this to me
Don't give up now
We've just begun, get back on your feet
Keep pushing, pushing
Keep blowing off steam
Ooh, we can't stop'til something kills this machine
Kill this machine, kill this machine
It keeps on ringing in my ears
Kill this machine, kill this machine
Kill this machine, it keeps on ringing in my ears
Kill this machine
