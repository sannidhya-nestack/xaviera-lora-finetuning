Big dirty city, almost not breathing
Power is up, but it's not really there
Big ugly mister, cursing his sister
Not gonna stop,'cause I really don't care
I'm bragging, I'm speeding, I'm actually flying
I'm busy, I'm waiting, that's all that I got
Now stopping and looking for the freaking park
When all of a sudden I see the disabled's blue spot
Hey, come on, mister, mister policeman
Gimme this ticket'cause I'm outta control
Hey, come on, mister, what a damn twister
I just parked here to get my go-o-o-o-o-o-o
Misunderstanding, so outstanding
Blue uniform right in front of my eyes
Hey, Mr. Lieutenant, I start pretending
Big thunderstorm has come out of the skies
I'm riding, speeding, actually flying
I'm crazy, waiting, that's all that I got
Now stopping and looking for the freaking parking
When all of a sudden I see the disabled's blue spot
Hey, come on, mister, mister policeman
Don't give me this ticket'cause I'm outta control
Hey, come on, mister, what a damn twister
I just parked here to get my girl
To get my girl
Hey, come on, mister, mister, policeman
Don't give me this ticket'cause I'm outta control
Hey, come on, mister, what a damn twister
I just parked here to get my girl
To get my girl
