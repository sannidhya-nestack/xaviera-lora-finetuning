We don't have to, we don't have to, we don't have to
We don't have to, we don't have to, we don't have to hide
Here comes the daylight
I've been staying up all night
I'm just killing my time
Cause I'm looking for something to free me
Each day keeps repeating
Is there a way
To touch the other side of the universe outside
A different place
Where we don't have to hide our spirit inside
Not many days are left for us to find something that satisfies
Stayin' on a joyride
Doin' everything you can to shield your eyes
You're just killing your time
you're looking for something assuring
That everything's okay
Is there a way to touch the other side
Or universe outside
A different place where we don't have to hide our spirit inside anymore
Whoa
We don't have to
We don't have to
We don't have to
We don't have to
We don't have to
We don't have to hide
We don't have to
We don't have to
We don't have to
We don't have to
We don't have to, we don't have to hide
