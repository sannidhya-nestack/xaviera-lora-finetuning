I meet you at the club I go to
You look so shiny when the spotlight hit you
And right there I knew I'd fall in way
Amazingly beautiful
The way you move so easy
Couldn't do a thing but watch
In my thoughts I found myself
Just running towards screaming
Let's dance
You gotta dance
So dance with me
This perfect night
Just can't be real
I made you mine
That's what I do
Show my feelings right to you
You've gotta dance
So dance with me
This perfect night
Just can't be real
I made you mine
That's what I do
Show my feelings right to you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Ooh, yeah, that's right, let's dance
Let's dance!
