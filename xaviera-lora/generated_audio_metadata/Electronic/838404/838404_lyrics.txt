Do you love her?
Do you love her?
Do you love her?
Do you love her?
I just wanna do ya
It ain't love
Such a lonely time
I just wanna do ya
It ain't love
Such a lonely time
I just wanna do ya
Do ya
I just wanna kill ya
It ain't love
Such a lonely time
I just wanna kill ya
It ain't love
Such a lonely time
I just wanna kill ya
It ain't love
Such a lonely time
You're beautiful, you're beautiful, you're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're the love of my life
