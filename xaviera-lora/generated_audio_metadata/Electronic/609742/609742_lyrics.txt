And then the court statement mentioned filthy thoughts. That's right, that's right. And that particular theory can be extracted from that case and applied in other instances, do you understand?
The content of a person's thoughts will be the thing which is the crime, or the thing
that generates the crime.
The whole idea of a filthy thought is a religious concept, not really a legal concept, because the Christians who are the most involved in politics right now are Christian extremists who believe in the imminent approach of Armageddon, the end of the world.
In their theology, in order for Jesus to return, we must have another very big war.
Because only after this war can their savior return.
So with that in mind, to think that these people are connected with the Defense Department
or any other aspect of the U .S. government endangers the rest of the world.
