Under the stars looking down upon me
With the cold distant gaze
Under the buildings glaring down at me
From nearing windows of glass
I wonder why I still feel this way
I wonder why I still feel this way
Under the sky
Where you can adore me with its unseen gaze
Under the people's watching, mocking, unfriendly eyes
Which are ablaze
I wonder why I still feel this way
I wonder why I still feel this way
Under the sky
Under the people's eyes
Under the stars
Under the buildings high
Is it just me?
Or is emptiness the theme of the universe?
Of the universe?
