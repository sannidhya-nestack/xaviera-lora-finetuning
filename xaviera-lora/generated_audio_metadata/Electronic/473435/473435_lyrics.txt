Please don't, God is on the other line
Consulting me about my past life
I know for sure that this is the last time
I should have never let them inside
The final chapter has arrived
The final chapter has arrived
Save your breath for the bitter end
I wish that I could breathe the same air
But you exclude me
How could you et and reject my heart? (My heart)
Alone in the rain, this old rusty
Robotic soul, begs one thing
To rust in pace, to feel the release
Call me again, I'll speak to you in dial tones
Stormy day, loud so gray, they hang over me
Alone in the shade
This cursed place
Won't ever let me go
Can't you see
See I'm in pain
I don't know why
You et
I reject
My Stonehall
I'm so broken, so broken, outspoken
Break me, break me
I never wanted it to end like this
And I wish I never found you
Wish I never found you
If only I knew
If only I knew
If only I knew
Knew about you
I'm not afraid of the dark, I'm afraid of the light
Rain is running, pain is coming
Rain is running, pain is coming
Rain is running, pain is coming
Rain is running, rain is coming, rain is running, rain is coming, rain is running
Rain is coming, rain is coming
Rain is running, pain is coming
Rain is running, pain is coming
