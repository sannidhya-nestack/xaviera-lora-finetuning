I'll tell you what it felt like
Living in the shadow of your heart
I'll tell you what it felt like
Living in the home you'd torn apart
Won't take it any longer
Fighting all your fire, breaking free
Growing so much stronger
Tell me why
You did everything to hurt me, everything to burn me, everything to turn my life
Did you ever think I'd trust you, ever think I'd love you twice?
Well I'm not gonna take it, you're not gonna make it right, make it right, make it right
Gonna spread my wings and fly
Gonna set my heart on fire
Gonna spread my wings and fly
Gonna set my heart on fire
Gonna spread my wings and fly
Gonna set my heart on fire
Gonna spread my wings and fly
Gonna set my heart on fire
Tell me why
You did everything to hurt me
Everything to burn me
Everything to turn my life
Did you ever think I'd trust you?
Ever think I'd love you twice?
Well I'm not gonna take it
You're not gonna make it right
Make it right, make it right
You did everything to hurt me, everything to burn me, everything to turn my life
Did you ever think I'd trust you, ever think I'd love you twice?
Well I'm not gonna take it, you're not gonna make it right, make it right, make it right
