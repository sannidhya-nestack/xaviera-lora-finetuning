It's like butcher knives in that they've seen all my scars
It's getting hard to sleep with all these damn bums
Why would we help when we can start a war?
Give me money, give me money, give me money, give me more
Dear God, tell your people they need to relax
They should stop being fake and take off their masks
Increase their tolerance and open your minds
Disown, there's no accountability for your crimes
This is a new trend, transcendence
I am the transport
Church with the outstretched hand, yeah
It's time to extort
I have seen your shadow
Sins are sins are sins
It's time to reinvent yourself
This is a new religion
The eyes of like stars and that they glow in the night but they're so fucking ugly
The goddess of delight
I am the arrow brain the traveler of space
The gunner of hypocrisy shit I'm the ace
A puppet of love a Marianne out of hate
Parliament of the people, the perfect of taint
Heartless disciple, my entrails are devoid
Removal of ans, I am the android
This is the transcendence, I am the transformed
Church with the outstretched hand, yeah
It's time to extort
I have seen your shadow
Sins are sins are sins
It's time to repent yourself, yeah
This is a new religion
