People running rapid under city lights
Just like the way that we used to do
Love has found us and it's time to right
All the wrongs that have been done to you
All the wrongs, all the wrongs, all the wrongs
That people put you through
All the rights, all the rights, all the rights
That truly made you
Come alive inside
People running rapid under city lights
Just like the way that we used to do
Love has found us and it's time to right
All the wrongs that have been done to you
People running rapid under city lights
Just like the way that we used to do
Love has found us, and it's time to right
All the wrongs that have been done to you
All the wrongs, all the wrongs, all the wrongs
That people put you through
All the rights, all the rights, all the rights
That truly made you
Come alive inside
People running rapid under city lights
Just like the way that we used to do
Love has found us and it's time to right
All the wrongs that have been done to you
All the wrongs, all the wrongs, all the wrongs
That people put you through
All the rights, all the rights, all the rights
That truly made you
Come alive inside
