Talk to you, give me one good reason I should talk to you
And why should I believe that what you say is true
When all I hear is bullshit and lies and lies and lies and lies
Drive me home, why should I believe you're gonna drive me home
When all you wanna do is get me on my own
And stick your lying face to my thighs, my thighs, my thighs, my thighs
I'll dance for you honey if you show me what you got
And I'll spend all your money on a million dollar yacht
And I'll suck you up
And I'll spit you out and I'll play with your babies
you scream and shout, "Oh yeah !" (Oh yeah!)
you scream and shout, "Oh yeah !" (Oh yeah!)
you scream and shout, "Oh yeah !" (Oh yeah!)
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
You dirty freakin' loser!
Torture me, the times that I spend with you can torture me
I don't know why I let you put your hands on me
It makes me feel so dirty inside, inside, inside, inside
Wild and free
Never change my spirit to reality
I don't need a reason to set me free
Forever set my limits
The skies, the skies, the skies, the freaking limits
I'll dance for you honey if you show me what you got
And I'll spend all your money on a million dollar yacht
And I'll suck you up and I'll spit you out
And I'll play with your babies'til you scream and shout, oh yeah (oh yeah)
you scream and shout, oh yeah (oh yeah),'til you scream and shout, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (oh yeah)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Tell them scream and clap, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Tell them scream and clap, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
