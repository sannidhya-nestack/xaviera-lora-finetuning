There's still so many things to do
But you stand there and you're bound to get
And no longer will we just agree
And no further will we push our mind
And when very little time remains
The time rising in your narrow mind
Eyes
Eyes
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise
We thought that we could change the world
But now we're simply trying to survive
We have been nearer to your fate
Run tripping over deadly sins
Betrayed by your inner eye
You are clinging to whatever was
Insects above the running ground
Angels falling through the ice and clouds
Rise
Rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise
