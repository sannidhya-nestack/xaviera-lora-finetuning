I'll see you next time.
Don't believe the hype, Andre the giant hype
Roddy call me Roddy Piper with a bagpipe
Why you acting like a dummy, it's about to get ugly
You popping like a bubble, I just rap like a mummy
I'm way past ugly, despicable
When I taste blood I get a grip like a pit bull
Or a Burmese python, or a constrictor
It's about to hit the fan cause I'm off the ripped up
Pause uh make your body freeze
No gimmick no limit top quality
Wanna battle me why you just a novelty
And I'm half human half hip hop ology
Organically grown like fruit from a tree
Why you synthetic polymer chemistry
Not industry underground that is my channel
Started out with just a snapback, chucks and a flannel
And I got them handles, they amplify venom
Light'em up like fireworks, blow'em out like candles
And a long compound through the microfiber
Soldered sixteen bars just to stay hyper
They see me gettin' vexed like a voodoo doll
Grew a beard and a fro just to throw you off
Listen, get your back up off the wall
All we came to do is
