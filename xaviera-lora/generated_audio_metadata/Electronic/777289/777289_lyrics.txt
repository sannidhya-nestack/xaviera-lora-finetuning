A music box, a music box
A music box, a music box
A music box, a music box
A music box, a music box
Music that I know fills me
The rhythm that I know soothes me
I question every part of me that put me here
When I'm running round in my oblivion
The fight I have now wears me down
At times I need to change myself
I'm wide awake
All these hidden messages in the music drive me crazy
They drive me crazy
They drive me crazy
All these hidden messages in the music drive me crazy
They drive me crazy
They drive me crazy
It's simple
Mechanics, don't look for period on semantics
It's simple, mechanics, don't look for period on semantics

It's simple
Mechanics, don't look from here, don't semantics
It's impossible, mechanics, don't look from here, don't semantics
