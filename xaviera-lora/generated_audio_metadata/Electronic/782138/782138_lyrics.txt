Shy girl, I knew you were the one
From the first time that I saw you
Shorty stepped up in the club
Every eye was on you
Every girl was jealous like crazy
Every player wishing just maybe they could be the one
To take you home tonight girl
But you ain't having none of that, baby
Only I can see the lady heading to the back
While all your home girls left to dance
You take a seat
I'm at your feet to tell you, baby, she ain't good
Girl, I knew you were the one
From the first time that I saw you in the back of the club
Had to have you in my world
Girl, you stole my heart and I pulled you to the dance floor
I took a look in your eyes, I saw a shy girl
I saw my shy girl
Yeah, yeah, you're so beautiful
Why you hiding away, girl?
Did somebody do you wrong?
Maybe you're just waiting for someone special
Let me be the man, girl
Let me take your hand and show you
Everything that you've been holding on for
On the dance floor, can you feel me?
Can you see there's so much more?
I have to show, just let me baby, shine girl
I knew you were the one
From the first time that I saw you
In the back of the club
Had to have you in my world
Girl you stole my heart and I pulled you to the dance floor
I took a look in your eyes, I saw a shot
Can you feel my love? (ooh baby)
Can you feel my touch? (can you feel it?)
Open up your love
Open your love and let me in, baby (shy girl)
So shy, so shy, girl (I knew you were the one)
From the first time that I saw you
In the back of the club
Had to have you in my world (my world)
Girl, you stole my heart (my baby)
And pulled you to the dance floor
I took a look in your eyes (I saw a shy, shy girl)
Shy girl (I knew you were the one)
I knew you were the one (from the first time that I saw you)
In the back of the club, had to have you in my world
Girl you stole my heart, and I'm blue to the death
I took a look in your eyes, I saw a shot girl
Girl, I saw my shot girl
