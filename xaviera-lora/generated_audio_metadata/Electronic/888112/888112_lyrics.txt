We have found so many grounds stepping on each other
Now it's time to lose ourselves there's something we can do
When we get that close you're all that I can see
This has been so long you're all that I want now
When we get that close, you're all that I can see
This has been so long, you're all that I want now
I know you see, I know you need
All of the things that hurt me too
Matter of time, matter of time
Matter of time you need me too
I look'round, I see you there
There's so much that I want
Moving close, I took your hand
Now it's mine forever
When we get that close, you're all that I can see
This has been so long, you're all that I want now
When we get that close you're all that I can see
This has been so long you're all that I want now
We don't need, we don't need, we don't need, we don't need you
It's just a matter of time
We don't need, we don't need, we don't need, we don't need you
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
