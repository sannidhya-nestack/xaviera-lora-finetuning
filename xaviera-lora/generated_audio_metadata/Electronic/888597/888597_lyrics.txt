Lying on your knees, can't take anymore
Broken in pieces outside my door
Say you're giving up, feeling so alone
So for tonight this will be your home
Don't know
I don't know what to say, I don't know what to do
But still I will try to take care of you
May seem like the end but you're gonna go so far
And I'll be around when wound have turned to scar
And I'll be around when wound have turned to scar
Impossible to think that you can move on
When someone you love is suddenly gone
On the edge right now but you're gonna do so well
Believe me cause I got the scars to tell
Don't know what to say, I don't know what to do
But still I will try to take care of you
May seem like the end but you're gonna go so far
And I'll be around when wound have turned to scar
I don't wanna feel this love
I don't wanna feel this love
And I'll be around when wound have turned to scar
Don't know what to say, I don't know what to do
But still I will try to take care of you
May seem like the end but you're gonna go so far
And I'll be around
When wounds have turned to scar
