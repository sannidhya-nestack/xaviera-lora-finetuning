Let me kiss you baby on the floor
Let me kiss you baby once we get there and fall
Let me take you out to drink on our own
Can we travel through those long dark nights?
Let me kiss that pretty baby on the floor
Let me kiss that baby that's what girls do, girl
Let me take you out and make it all our way
Happy together through those long dark nights
Oh, yes
