Play my heart like destiny
Like borrowed limbs placed in time
Oh
Break my heart like a candle in
And dancing fools are okay
Oh, where is the love we had begun
Don't think you're the only, lonely one
Where is the love we had but once in this world
In this womb, take my heart
And within your hands, I'll shed my skin
And to fly, oh
Where is the love we had begun?
Don't think you're the only lonely one
Where is the love we had but once in this world?
In this room
Where is the love we had begun
To make you the only lonely one
Where is the love we'll have at once
In this room
In this world
In this world
(audience applauding)
