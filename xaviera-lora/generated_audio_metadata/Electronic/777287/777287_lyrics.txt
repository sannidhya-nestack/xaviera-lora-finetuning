A little fiction feeds your fantasy
A little fiction dampens the reality
A little fiction
A little fiction
Do you think we don't see you in the shadows trying to be the invisible man?
Do you think we don't know you take our every word to make of it what you can?
Go get your inspiration
Your own sense of adventure
Stop feeding us all to the lions
They never really say that you're a taste for selling people out
I don't wanna be saved, it's red and displayed
I hear you like you're dirty and cheap
I'm working you out, you're tearing me down
'Cause I feel you see you're playing me out
A little fiction feeds your fantasy
A little fiction dampens the reality
A little fiction, a little fiction
Where'd you find all your lies and your convictions?
you tell them all so easily
And you're not so soft yet so persistent
Tell me does it feel good baby?
Go get your inspiration
Your own sense of adventure
I don't wanna be saved
This red hand displayed
I hear you like a dirty empty
I'm working you out
You're tearing me down
I feel you see you're playing me up
Don't wanna be saved
Regret I'm just playing
I hear you like it dirty and cheap
I'm working you out
You're tearing me down
I feel you see you're playing me up
(I know you're not the one)
Just a broken down angel
Cold when she wants trade
Kick me into touch then throw me all away
Mr. Machiavelli, don't mess around with me
Don't need you around, making sure everybody gets a piece
Left with my memory, left with your taint
I'm made of fiction chasing time and time again
Please go away'cause I'm feeling so drained
Go away, go away, I ain't gonna play
Do you think we don't see you in the shadows trying to be the invisible man?
Do you think we don't know you take on every word
To make of it what you can, can, can
I don't wanna be saved, as red as it's playing
I hear you like you're dirty empty
I'm working you out, you're tearing me down
I feel you see you're playing me
I don't wanna be saved, as red as it's playing
'Cause I hear you like you're dirty and cheap
I'm working you out
You're tearing me down
I feel you see you're playing me catch
My words on your tongue but tell me how do I say it?
Would've won my time to help in your waste
I'm working you out
You're tearing me down
Cause I feel you see you're playing me out
Don't wanna be saved
Respect and decide
Cause I hear you like it dirty and taped
I'm working you out
You're tearing me down
Cause I feel you see you're playing me out (I'm not allowed to lie)
(I'm not allowed to lie)
(You'll be the same)
I'm made of fiction
