This is a story about ding-a-dang-a-dong
Man and the bones, oh
Ding-a-ding-a-dong
Man and the bones, oh
Deep, dynamic, long, merry-go-round sport
That's where you make your city
He can be perfect but for you
That's the dog
He's the daddy and the dog
He's the daddy and the dog
That is the only thing that I know
What is making me, what is making me
What we gonna do, what we gonna do
When it's making all of you
Only what we have to do
When it gives you all of you
Ding, ding, dang, dang, dong, dong, dong
Ding, ding, dang, dang, dong, dong
In
Dawn
Like you got no soul
Like you got no soul
He's gonna make me fall into you
And make me lose everything that's real
What you gonna do when you think it ain't with you?
What you gonna do when you think it ain't with you?
What's wrong with you
And he's got himself out of here
What's it gonna do?
What's it gonna do?
What's it gonna do when he's got himself brand new?
What you gonna do when he's gonna make it up to you?
