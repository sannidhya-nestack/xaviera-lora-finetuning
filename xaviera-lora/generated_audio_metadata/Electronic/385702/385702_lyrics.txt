And the same by the light of the moon, my love
While the flowers no longer bloom, my love
What was lost just yesterday, my love
Plays down like a line in the road
It's on your face again
That worn out crippled child look that drew me in
Now that it's expired wanna do me in
Lying like a martyr for your private sin
Again and again
And it's saying by the light of the moon my love
While the flowers no longer in bloom my love
What was ours just yesterday my love
Lays down like a line in the road
And it's saying by the light of the moon my love
While the flowers no longer in bloom my love
What was ours just yesterday my love
Lays down like a line in the road
Under a starless sky
Manipulators I await your alibi
Standing like a mannequin your softer side
Panting like a heart rat for one last goodbye
I never said
All of the nights are broken promises
And all of the words are led to silences
And it's stained by the light of the moon, my love
While the flowers no longer bloom, my love
What was ours just yesterday, my love
Lays down like a light in the road
And the same by the light of the moon, my love
While the flowers no longer in bloom, my love
What was ours just yesterday, my love
Lays down like a line in the road
You're on to (you're on to)
Someone new, it's true
You never hold my hand no more
But you go, I hold you to stay
If it's me you loved, you could never walk away
In the same bed, the light of the moon, my love
While the flowers no longer bloom, my love
What was ours just yesterday, my love
Lays down like a light in the road
And the same by the light of the moon, my love
Are the flowers no longer in bloom, my love
What was ours just yesterday, my love
Plays down like a line in the road
And the same by the light of the moon, my love
Are the flowers no longer in bloom, my love
What was ours just yesterday, my love
Plays down like a line in the road
