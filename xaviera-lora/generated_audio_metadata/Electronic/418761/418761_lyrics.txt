One little horse just to feed the end
Falling on myself to see it
Morning almost comes to the end
One little voice just to speak the air
Falling on my sh-sh-sh-shoulders, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Falling on my sh-sh-sh-shoulders, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why do we know ourselves so much bigger?
One in a million, yeah
