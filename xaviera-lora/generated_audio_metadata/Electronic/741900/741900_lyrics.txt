The maker wakes up always drowning
The ecstasy comes first
Exposure to the jagged craving
The overbearing thirst
Blind, blind, blind, lush
Blind, blind, blind, lush
Blind, blind, blind, lush
Blind, blind, lush
Fearless fair warning as the anxious cry
Timeless bold obsession on a thin supply
The maker wakes up always frowning
The ecstasy comes first
Exposure to the jagged craving
The overbearing thirst
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
All the manic raise their glasses high
While the rain of blood falls from the sky
Since the therapy just caused a curse
Who'll survive and who will arrive first?
All the manic raise their glasses high
While the rain of blood falls from the sky
Since the therapy just caused a curse
Who'll survive and who will arrive first?
Live, live, live, live, live, live, live, live, live, live
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Blind, blind
