Slowly driving (slowly moving)
Never stopping (never pausing)
Over houses (over buildings)
Always moving (ever closer)
Talking whispers (in the shallows)
Weather movements (never follows)
Echoes calling (voices falling)
We know the names of everyone
Slow motion, electrocution, a hidden ghost remains
You're like a chemical haunting, a ghost inside my veins
Slowly driving (slowly moving)
Never stopping (never pausing)
Over houses (over buildings)
Always moving (ever closer)
Talking with us (in the shadows)
Whatever moves (never follows)
Echoes calling (voices calling)
We know the names of everyone
Slow motion, electrocution
A hit, a curse remains
You're like a chemical haunting
A ghost inside my veins
If I could leave you now
I would never et the pain
Burning sensations, I'm yours in every way
Slow motion electrocution
Slow motion electrocution
I'm sorry
You forever my darling I appear
