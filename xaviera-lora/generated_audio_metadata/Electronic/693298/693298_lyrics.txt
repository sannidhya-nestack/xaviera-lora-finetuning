You're like a non-off-drama machine
You got me wondering how it's working
You're like a non-stop fuel factory
I got the strength just of energy
You make a whole lot out of nothing
You make a whole lot out of nothing
You make a whole lot out of nothing
You make a whole lot out of nothing
Out of nothing
You make a whole lot out of nothing
You make a whole lot out of nothing
You make a whole lot out of nothing
Out of nothing
You're like the mixed up sweet of sixteen
You give me something to believe in
I got a whole fire of your story
They make an awful lot of babies
You make a whole lot out of nothing
You make a whole lot out of nothing
Don't even wonder
That you
Make a lot
Not to love
You make a lot
Not to love
You make a whole lot out of nothing
You make a whole lot out of nothing
You make a whole lot out of nothing
Out of nothing
You make a whole lot out of nothing
You make a whole lot out of nothing
You make a whole lot out of nothing
Out of nothing
