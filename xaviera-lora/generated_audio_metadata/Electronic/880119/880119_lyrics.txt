Could you give me a break, I'm just a fool
When it comes to loving you
Could you give me a break, I'm just fool
When it comes to loving you
I'm so tired of playing games with love
I'm so tired you're playing with my heart in love
And I know ya, you feel a little bad
So why don't ya quit playing with my head?
Could you give me a break, I'm just a fool
When it comes to loving you
Could you give me a break, I'm just fool
When it comes to loving you
Why don't you give me a break, I'm just a fool
When it comes to loving you
Could you give me a break, I'm just a fool
When it comes to loving you
