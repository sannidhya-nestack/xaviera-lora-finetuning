Beautiful lips tell beautiful lies
Careless whisper bittersweet goodbyes
Something in your eyes feels so unsure
More than a poor heart can endure
I don't wanna be the fool again
Swung dive in your shallow pond again
Playing roulette with the heart of sin
How many ways can I say I love you, I do
Are you cupid in disguise?'Cause your love is so sweet
You took captive of my heart, I can hardly even speak
An angel must have kissed you, that's why I'm drawn into
Your witty conversations, I love you that simple
One great mystery of time, how to get away with the perfect crime
Out of sight girl, you're out of your mind, I didn't even think you would rob me blind
Stole the heart beating inside my chest, now I'm yelling freeze'cause you're under arrest
Why did you return to the scene of the crime? Temptation was to toss that vine
Those random crazy thoughts
Floating inside of my head
I think I dig you
You know it's the ties that bind us
In fact I think they blind us
Beautiful lips tell beautiful lies
Careless whisper bitter sweet goodbyes
Something in your eyes feels so unsure
More than a poor heart can endure
I don't want to be the fool again
Swung dive in your shallow pond again
Playing roulette with the hardest sin
How many ways can I say I love you? I do
One great mystery of time
How to get away with the perfect crime
Out of sight girl you're out of your mind
I didn't even think you would rob me blind
Stole the heart beating inside my chest
Now I'm yelling freeze cause you're under arrest
Why did you return to the scene of the crime
Temptation was the ties that bind
How many ways can I say I love you, I do
No, don't you come back now
It's too late
But I don't really want you to go
But I don't want you to stay either
How many ways can I say I love you? I do
How many ways can I say I love you?
I do
How many ways can I say I love you, I do?
How many ways can I say I love you ,I do?
How many ways can I say I love you ,i do?
How many ways can I say I love you, i do?
How many ways can I say I love you, I do
