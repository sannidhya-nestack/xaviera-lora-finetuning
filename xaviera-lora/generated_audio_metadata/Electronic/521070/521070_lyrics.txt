Although anything it's easily explained to you
There's no show my emotions are all too true
Although anything it's easily explained to you
There's no show my emotions are all too true
Although anything is easily explained to you
There's no show my emotions are all too true
Although anything is easily explained to you
There's no show my emotions are all too true
La la la la, la la la la, ooh
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
La la la la, la la la la
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Although infinity seems to be a crazy view
There's no show of emotion for all who's true
Although anything is given, he explains to you
Says I show my emotions are all too true
Although anything it seems to be explained to you
As I show my emotions are all too true
Although anything it seems to be explained to you
As I show my emotions are all too true
La la la la, la la la la, ooh
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Listen to the melody, listen to the melody, yeah, yeah, yeah, la la la la, la la la la
Ooh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
La la la la, la la la la, ooh
