I'm bad beside a man I hate
I reconcile my shameful fate
It's for my son this deed I do
And so this text I send to you
My one true love you'll always be
The center of my galaxy
My evil act results in gain
But cannot soothe this threshing pain
A devil's deal, I've made this pact
I'm in too deep, I can't turn back
I sacrifice eternal bliss
Sealed with this unholy kiss
Sealed with His unholy kiss
My dear sweet Lord must I be damned
Now that you see just who I am
My one true love I have defiled
For funds to save my dying child
Devil's deal, I've made this pact
I'm in too deep, I can't turn back
I sacrifice eternal bliss
Sealed with this unholy seal
Sealed with this unholy kiss
Ik smalum onum from bad comes good
So far beyond whether I should
When mercy has its way with us
We will return
We lost
