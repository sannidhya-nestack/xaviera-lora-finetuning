It's really over
You've made your last stand
You got me crying
As was your plan
But when my loneliness is through
I'm gonna find another you
You've taken your best suit
Designer shoes
You left me drowning
Alone with these blues
But when my broken heart is through
I'm gonna find another you
There's no use in pretending
There's no reason why
I should have seen it coming
Ain't no surprise
I'm haunted by the memory
When you walked away
But I'll pick myself back up again
And find, find another way, yeah
I hold you no malice
I wish you well
I'm finally over this living hell
now my loneliness is through, oh
I'm gonna find another you, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
