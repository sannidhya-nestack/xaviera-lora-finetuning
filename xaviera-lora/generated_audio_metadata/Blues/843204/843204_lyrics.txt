I said give me all your love babe
In the morning
I said give me all your love babe
Right through the day
I said give me all your love child
When the night time falls on me
I said give me all your love baby
Don't you take your sweet love away
She said boy I have to go
You know I just can't stay
My shipping has come in and I'm leaving
Oh I'm leaving
I said baby can't you stay just one more day
I said baby can't you stay just one more hour with me now
Five more minutes woman is all I really crave
Oh, go on and kiss me one more time before you take your sweet love away, oh yeah
She said, "Boy, I have to go, you know I just can't stay
My stupid house coming and I'm leaving, oh I'm leaving today"
Said give me all your love babe
In the morning
Give me all your love babe
Right through the day
Give me all your love babe
When the night time falls on me
Give me all your love, babe
And don't you take your sweet love away
This is, yes, yes
She said, "Boy, I have to go
You know I just can't stay
My ship it has come in and I'm leaving
Oh yes, I'm leaving, leaving today"
She told me this, she said boy I have to go
You know I just can't stay
My ship it has come in and I'm leaving
Oh I'm leaving
