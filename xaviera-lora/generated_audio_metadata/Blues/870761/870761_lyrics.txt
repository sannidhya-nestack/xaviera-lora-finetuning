Day break, earthquake, couldn't get much worse
Bad dude, I'm screwed, Lord I must be cursed
Low pay, bad day, sniffing all around
All stuck, bad luck's the only thing I've found
Must be Deja Vu, evil spirit vibe
Resting on my shoulder here inside my tribe
Thought I had grown wiser, aging gracefully
Must be déjà vu, too, most apparently
Hear the door go knock-knock
The dog's out on my porch
Hear the knock my block off
See the burning torch
Couldn't take a joke-joke, only borrowing
Stole the mobster's money
But if that's such a sin
Must be deja vu do
Evil spirit vibe
Restin' on my shoulder
Here inside my tribe
Thought I had grown wiser, aging gracefully
Must be déjà vu, do most apparently
Must be déjà vu-do, evil spirit vibe
Restin' on my shoulder, here inside my tripe
Thought I had grown wiser, aging gracefully
Well it must be déjà vu-do, most apparently
Day break, earthquake, couldn't get much worse
Bad dude, I'm screwed, Lord I must be cursed
Low pay, bad day, sniffing all around
All stuck, bad luck's the only thing I've found
Must be déjà vu, do evil spirit vibe
Restin' on my shoulder here inside my tribe
Thought I had one wiser, aging gracefully
Must be déjà vu, do
Most apparently
Must be déjà vu do
Most apparently
