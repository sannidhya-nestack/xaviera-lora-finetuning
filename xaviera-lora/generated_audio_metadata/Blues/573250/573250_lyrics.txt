Your lips are moving but I don't hear a word
They're flappin' and a-flappin' like the wings of a bird
Your nostrils are flaring, you're ready to fight
Looks like a pure sixer tonight
But I've had a hard day, work was really a bear
You may think I'm listening, but I really don't care
I'm projecting myself far from here
I'm getting myself a bear, woman
You might as well be ten thousand miles away
You might as well be ten thousand miles away
I'm at the top of the mountain, you're at the bottom of the sea
And you ain't even bothering me
I've heard you complain enough to already know
Every boring old line in this one woman show
I've listened to your snarl, a scolding hiss
So you might wanna listen to this, baby
You might as well be ten thousand miles away
You might as well be ten thousand miles away
I'm knockin' all the doors and throwin' out the keys
So you ain't even botherin' me
You might as well be ten thousand miles away
You might as well be ten thousand miles away
I'm at the top of a mountain
You're at the bottom of the sea
And you ain't even bothering me
Might as well be
Ten thousand miles away
Might as well be
Ten thousand miles away
Might as well be
Ten thousand miles away
Might as well be
Nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine miles away
