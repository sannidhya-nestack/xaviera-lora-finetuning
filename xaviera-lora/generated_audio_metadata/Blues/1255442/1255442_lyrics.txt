In the heart of the country on the clear blue sky
Where the green grass grows and the pretty birds fly
Singing country blues, oh, singing country blues
Simple as one, two, that's my only view
I got my red boots on, stomping to the beat
For mama and papa, life's so sweet
Singing country blues, oh, singing country blues
Like the bright sunshine chasing away the blue
And the cotton fields beneath the warm sun's rays
We laugh, we play all those good old days singing country blues
Oh, singing country blues
It's a sweet, sweet song that never gives you the blues
I got my red boots on, stompin' to the beat with mama and papa
Life's so sweet singin' country blues, oh singin' country blues
Like the bright sunshine, chasin' away the blues
I got my red boots on, stompin' to the beat with mama and papa
Life's so sweet singin' country blues, oh singin' country blues
Like the bright sunshine, chasin' away the blues
I got my red boots on just stomping to the beat
Mama and Papa life's so sweet singing country blues
Oh, singing country blues
Like the bright sunshine chasing away the glues
I got my red boots on just stomping to the beat
Mama and Papa life's so sweet singing country blues
Oh, singing country blues
Like the bright sunshine chasing away the glues
Like the bright sunshine chasing away the glues
And the cotton fields beneath the warm sun's rays do laugh while we play all the school days singing country blues, oh, singing country blues, like the bright sunshine chasing away the gloom
In the cotton fields beneath the warm sun's rays
We laugh, we play, all those good old days
We laugh, we play, all those good old days
Singin' country blues, oh, singin' country blues
It's a sweet, sweet song that never gives you the blues
So that's my little song, it's so easy, it's so fun
