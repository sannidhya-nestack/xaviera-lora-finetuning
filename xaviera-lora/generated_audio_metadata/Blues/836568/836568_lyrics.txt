I was doing fine, minding my own business
Killing time, getting over her
Then you came uninvited, crashed my goodbye party
Now I'm crossing bridges I thought I'd burned
Lonely, leave me alone
I'm picking up the pieces of my broken home
My heart's made of glass and you're throwing stones
Lonely, leave me alone
You're no friend of mine
Dredging up old memories
Whispering her name in my ear
Still I'd offer you a drink
But I'm running out of whiskey
And praying my next shot
Makes you disappear
Lonely, leave me alone
I'm picking up the pieces of my broken home
My heart's made of glass and you're throwing stones
Lonely, leave me alone
Every word she said echoes in my head
Why won't you let me et
Lonely, leave me alone
I'm picking up the pieces of my broken home
My heart's made of glass and you're throwing stones
Lonely, leave me alone
Lonely, leave me alone
Lonely
Why don't you leave me alone?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
