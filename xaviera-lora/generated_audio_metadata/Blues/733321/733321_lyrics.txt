Down in Honey Island Swamp out of New Orleans
Lives the ugliest old woman you've ever seen
She got long stringy grey hair
Alligator skin
When she smiles at you with her wicked toothless grin
You better watch out
She lives by the swamp in an old log shack
Moonlight spell bring the hoodoo back
Her yellow claw stirs the potion around
Throws her head back and gulps it down
Cougar turned now into a hoodoo queen
Prettiest woman you ever did see
She's a swarm cougar prowling around
She's a swarm cougar
Cougar out on the town
Got a mojo bag full of black cat bones
Watch out young man she's gonna take you home
She been once done come back again
And boy you better watch out she devours young men
(Outro)
She croaks her long finger, beckons you to come
Who'd who spell leaves you deaf and dumb
Down the swamp and into her lair
Followed her swaying hips, long black hair
Who'd who smoke rises out of the ground
None of them young men have ever been found
She's a swamp cougar prowling around
She's a swamp cougar
I'm Cougar, out on the town
Got a mojo bag full of black cat bones
Watch out young man, she's gonna take you home
She been once done, come back again
And boy you better watch out, she devours young men
Swamp Cougar died a few weeks ago
Some young men found their way back home
They thought they would be safe, now the cougar's gone
Went down to the swamp, gonna burn down her place
The shack was gone, she left no trace
She was a swamp cougar prowling around
She was a swamp cougar out on the town
Got a mojo bag full of black cat bones
Watch out young man, she's gonna take you home
Sheep and ones don't come back again
And boy you better watch out
She's a swamp cougar prowlin' around
She's a swamp cougar out on the town
Got a mojo bag full of black cat bowls
Watch out young man, she's gonna take you home
She been once, done, come back again
And boy you better watch out
She devoured me
