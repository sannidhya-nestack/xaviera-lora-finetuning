I've always had time for you babe
you're forever on my mind
That's a cold hard simple truth
And I guess'cause love is blind
There's something you don't wanna see
If you're asking me
If I always feel the same
I'll be there for you when sun rays
Well, I don't know how long I can carry on with you, babe
There's something you don't wanna see
If you're asking me
It's like you want an open door
In case you don't want me anymore
It's like the reason why
You can't look me in the eye
The way you did before, did before
Are you keeping something back
In case it all pulls through?
Oh yeah
How will you ever know
That there could be a chance
For me and you? Yeah
There's something you don't wanna see
If you're asking me
There's something you don't want to see
Oh if you're asking me
If you're asking me
