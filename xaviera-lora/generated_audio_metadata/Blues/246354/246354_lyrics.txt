Got to have you mama, got to have you now
Said you're such a pretty lady
Got to figure out just how
When you walk the way you do
You know you really blew my mind
When you walk the way you do
Really blows my mind
I don't think no other lady
Could ever look so fine
If you're ever wondering, this is what you've got to do
I said if you're ever wondering this is what you got to do
You just come on back to my place I got everything for you
