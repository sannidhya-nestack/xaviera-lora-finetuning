Hill hounds and the boss man never let you be
Evil hearted women drove you to the whiskey
Stood down at the crossroads, wrung your hands and cried
No one seemed to know you, all just passed you by
Love in vain made you moan
Hot tamales made you smile
Gut feelings on steel strings
Echo down through time
Love they keep on burning
Still rang true
Living, breathing
Bottleneck blues
Friars Point to Vicksburg
Bell House all night long
Rose up in the morning
Biscuit roller gone
Said come on in my kitchen girl
Bound to be rain
For until late
The same old battle pain
Love in vain made you moan
Hot tamales made you smile
Gut feelings on steel strings
Echo down through time
Lord they keep on burning
Still rain true
Living, breathing
Bottleneck blues
Bottleneck blues
I got ramblin' on my mind
Hammer down my wife when she wants
She breakin' on the dollar most anywhere she goes
She got a mortgage on my body
Now lean on my soul
