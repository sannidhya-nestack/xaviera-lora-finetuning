The older you get, the more you learn about loss
Sooner or later you'll find that death is the boss
Friends, family, lovers will all fade away
While you're still left facing just one more day
I once had a family
Now they're mostly all gone
I walked the pathways of life
For a long long time
Until I met a woman
Who helped make things right
Until we started to
To fuss and to fight
I had a friend who took his own life
Left behind his old mother, grown children and beautiful wife
He moved way down south just to start a new life
He lost it all, left nothing but turmoil and strife
He thought having wealth and status was the true way of living
It was all about taking and not about giving
Big house, fancy cars, they meant nothing at all
They couldn't prevent that ultimate fall
The older you get, the more you learn to balance
Sooner or later you'll find that death is the most
Friends, family, lovers will all fade away
While you're still facing just on my day
Just one more day
Just one more day
One more day
