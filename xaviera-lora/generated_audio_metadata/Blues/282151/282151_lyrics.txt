It's not my fault
I am not to blame
It's not my fault
I am not to blame
Don't put it on me, baby
I didn't light the flame
Don't you ever look before you go
Don't you ever think about the things you know
If bad things happen to you
It's not my fault
It's not my fault
It's not my fault
It's not my fault
It's not my fault
Ooh baby
I don't run your life
I don't tell you what to do
You wanna play your life like a kamikaze pilot
You wanna drink too much, you wanna party too hard
Hey baby, you're gonna have to pay the price
But don't tell me I did it to you, I am not to blame
So what if I'm a little bit wild?
So what if I do what I want to?
I pay my own way in this world, daddy
I do expect the same of you
If you don't look before you go
If you don't stop when you know
Oh, it's not my fault, oh no
You wanna walk on a high wire without a safety net
Ah, you could fall
Yeah, baby, well, that's anybody's good bet
When you hit the wall
Don't come crawling to me
It's not my fault
It's not my fault
You wanna drive a hundred miles
Down that shaky road
You gotta go faster than anybody else, baby
You gotta go, go, go, go, go
Well, when you hit the wall, don't come to me
it's not my fault, you hear? It's not my fault
Oh, I'm sorry, baby, yeah
I'm sorry you had a bad time
You know it hurts me
To know you hurt yourself but I am not to blame
So don't tell me I did it to you'cause it's not my fault
No, it's not my fault
No, it's not my fault
Whoa, baby, you had to fall
Driving into that brick wall
But it's not my fault
Oh baby it's not my, you know it's not my fault
