I'm wide awake, I'm well aware
I'm wide awake, I'm well aware
So don't you bring me down, no
Don't you dare
I'm wide awake
I was asleep, I was naive
I was asleep, I was naive
I wore my heart on my sleeve
Out of my sleep
I was blind but now I see
So don't you bring me down, no, baby
I'm wide awake, I'm well aware
Oh, what you doing, baby?
Don't you know it ain't right?
Like a used car salesman trying to feed me that used up line
I have both eyes open, won't make a fool out of me
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
Well, I'm gonna walk right through you
Talk right through you
No yes, no no, no maybe
Just like taking candy from a baby
I'm wide awake, I'm well-read
I know your name, I know your game, I know you well, I'm wide awake, I'm well aware
I know your game, I know your name, I'm wide awake, I'm well aware
