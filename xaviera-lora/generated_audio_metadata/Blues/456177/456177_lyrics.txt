Big bad sun
Don't you shine down on me
Big bad sun
Don't you shine down on me
You know the night time suits me fine
So go on and let me be
I can't rise in the morning
Cause I can't hardly sleep at night
I can't rise in the morning
Cause I can't hardly sleep at night
Well since my baby she's been gone
I can't stand the sight of daylight
Big bad sun
Ain't got nobody left alive
Big bad sun
Ain't got nobody to love
Ain't got nobody, no one
Except the moon and the stars and the heavens above
