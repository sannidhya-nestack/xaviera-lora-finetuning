I guess if I were to write a song, I'd write it something like this
Hardly a moment to spare
Looked for a second, but it wasn't there
Hardly a moment
And I ain't thinking'bout you
Hardly a moment to give
Hardly a moment
Long as I live
Hardly a moment
I ain't thinking'bout you
We were together not so long ago
I guess you found another friend
Never thought twice about letting you go
Baby, I've thought of nothing else since then
Hardly a moment goes by
Hardly a moment, as hard as I try
Hardly a moment
But I ain't thinking'bout you
We were together nice and long ago
I guess you went and found another friend
Never thought twice about letting you go
Bet I thought of nothing else since then
Hardly a moment goes by
Hardly a moment as hard as I try is hardly more
I ain't thinkin'bout you, hey baby
We were together not so long ago
I guess you went and found another friend
Never thought twice about letting you go
By my thought and none, none, nothing else until
Hardly a moment I swear
Hardly a moment that I didn't care
Hardly a moment (ooh)
That I ain't thinkin' is hardly a moment (ooh)
That I'm not drinkin' is hardly a moment (ah)
That I ain't thinkin'bout you
Pass me those button lads
