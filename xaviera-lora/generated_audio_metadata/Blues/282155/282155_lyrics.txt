I'm staring through these steel bars down in county
I'm wondering how in the world did I ever fall so low
The prison guard says I'm a scumbag loser (you're a scumbag loser)
And at this point in time I'm inclined to agree
The bully boys just point out the obvious
The pickpockets steal your blind with plenty cool
The prison intellectuals twist the facts to fit their own scenarios
And the winos throw up on your shoes
The drug dealer is strung out on your addiction
The crooked lawyer says the only thing he did wrong was get caught
You might say this will never happen to you
But a cynic is just a minister who's been defrocked
And I'm staring through these steel bars nine and counting
I'm wondering how in the world did I ever fall so low
The prison guard says I'm a scumbag loser (Slow on your scumbag loser)
And at this point in time I'm inclined to agree
Well my crime was I bought the car of my dreams
When it ran
The pink slip was no good so it seems
They arrested me at the DMV
The most docile criminal you'd ever see
And I said, "But officer, I'm innocent"
He said, "You got no money miss, you understand"
If you keep this up, we'll send you to civil brand
At least they don't hang car thieves here in Torrance
If they did it would be a disgrace for everybody
Except the florist
And I'm staring through these steel bars down in county
Let me out of here
I'm wondering how in the world did I ever fall so low
The prison guard says I'm a scumbag loser (Girl, you're a scumbag loser)
And at this point in time I'm inclined to agree
I'm staring through these steel bars down in county
Do I have at least one phone call?
Wondering how in the world did I ever fall so low?
Let me out of here!
The prison guard says I'm a scumbag loser
Zola, you're a scumbag loser
And at this point in time I'm inclined to agree
