Can you hear those steel strings crying
In the Austin, Texas night
That call's dancing in the shadows
Of a roadhouse neon light
And the Delta voodoo child
Is calling out across the waves
As we journey down the highway
We can feel your guitar play
Day by day
Night after night
Number one
You're number one keep shining oh so bright
When I'm looking out the window, the sky is crying over me
Couldn't understand the weather, but it's where I'm supposed to be
On the road to Timpaneli, it's the roughest place in town
Still you make it all so easy
When your SRV speaks out
Day by day
Night after night
Number one
You're number one keep shining oh so bright
