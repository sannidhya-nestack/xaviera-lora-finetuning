I got a call from the doctor.
She said I've got some news
Looks like you're gonna take a little trip
Have you ever heard of the blues?
Now you won't need to pack much
Just a pair of shades will do
You need a dark place
A dark place to have the blues
Yeah, you need a dark place
A dark place to have the blues
She said I'm gonna write out a little prescription
Just something to help get you through
You see I've been there myself
Even doctors get the blues
Now you won't be there too long
But you'll think that you will
Yeah it's a dark place
A dark place to have the blues
Yeah, you need a dark place
A dark place to have the blues
A dark place
You need a dark place to have the blues
Yeah, to have the blues
To have the blues
