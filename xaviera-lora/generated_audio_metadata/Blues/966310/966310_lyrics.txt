There's a thin man in a thin coat waiting by the way
I see him with his arms outstretched every day
He is saying mercy, have mercy lady on a poor sinner man
Mercy, have mercy lady
Help me if you can
There's a woman with a baby carriage
Kneeling in the road
So much older than her nineteen years
With her beloved she's saying mercy
Have mercy, Lord, on one such as me
Mercy, Lord have mercy
Set me free
As the world turns
Another day burns
Healing to ashes and smoke
Ashes and smoke
I'm wide awake and it's half past midnight
Well, you don't know why I stay
Or why I love you
But I do
I say mercy
Have mercy, baby, on a fool such as me
Mercy, mercy, baby
Let me be
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy
