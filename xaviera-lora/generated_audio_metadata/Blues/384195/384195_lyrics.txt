I've never been to Texas or to Nashville, Tennessee
Born and raised in Brooklyn
It's a city life for me
When I'm feeling lonely
You feel like I'm blue
I put on Hank or G e or Merle
And bid my blues adieu
I love that country music
Some think it's quite bizarre
But I love to hear the fiddles and the twang, the steel guitar
Oh, I love that country music
You can keep your rock and roll
you know that country music is the music of my soul
Well, I hate the taste of whiskey
And beer just makes me fat
I do not drive a pickup truck
Or wear a Stetson hat
Heed the smell of horses
Was not raised back on a farm
I do not have my lover's name
Tattooed upon my arm
But I love that country music
Some think it's quite bizarre
But I love to hear them fiddles and the twang of steel guitar
Oh, I love that country music
You can't keep your rock and roll
you know that country music is the music of my soul
Now hard rock gives me headaches
And jazz just makes me sad
When they say that rap is music
It gets me fighting, man
Opera drives me crazy
The classics make me sleep
In my mind country music is impossible to beat
I love that country music
Something is quite bizarre
But I love to hear them fiddles in the twang of steel guitar
Oh, I love that country music
You can keep your rock and roll
you know that country music is the music of my soul
Oh, I love that country music
Some think it's quite bizarre
But I love to hear them fiddles
And a twang on steel guitar
Love that comes from music
You can keep your rock and roll
Cause you know that comes from music
It's the music of my soul
It's the music of my soul
It's the music of my soul
