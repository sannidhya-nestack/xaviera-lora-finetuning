Sing a song of sixpence and pockets full of dust
The very things we can't have are the things we think we must
Ten more, ten more, what'll it be today?
The more the mouth of Mamma needs to moan
It makes you pay because you work plate, toll gate
Taking the power babe, run run run to the one who makes you wait
There's not a pill that can make you still
So beware you sons and daughters
Of the sins of your fathers
Mr. Brown goes downtown and puts his money down
Bets his name on credit for the lovely Mrs. Brown
Reaching for the brass ring and swinging for the fences
Losing all his loves and owns by interest rates and inches
Cause he works late, tollgate, taking the power bank
Run, run, run to the one who makes you wait
There's not a pill that can make you still
So beware you sons and daughters
Of the sins of your fathers
Of the sins of your fathers
Of the sins of your fathers
