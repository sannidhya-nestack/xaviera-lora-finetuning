Now I saw them walking by
While sitting on a curb
Those tatted souls
Po-po-so
And I said, mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Now a whole lot like mine, just like mine sometimes
Well I see it in their eyes even when they try to hide
They all want to belong to something like everybody does
Lord and I say, mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm, mmmm-hmm
I've seen enough to know
That I don't want to believe
Oh, there is all I see from where I sit, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Some call them true
And some would love to call them lies
But I think I would call them
Observations from a curve
Long nights and a hmm
Sitting right here learning something
living and dying
Laughing and crying
Observing from a curve
Hey, hey, yeah
'Cause I'm from a camp, yeah
Hey, hey, yeah
If you want to know the story
About how it's been so far
So much been dry like so many dows
The ups are hard to take
But that's life
That's what we've got
It's just a test
It's just a test
So I believe I'll answer every question that I'm asked
And I hope I will find the answer
And I'm seen from this curve
And I share with the living
And I cry for the dying
Some call them truth
And some would love to call them lies
But I think I will call them
Observation from a curb, long dead dead
Observation from a curb
Observation from a curb, long dead dead
Observation from a curb, observation from a curb
From a curve of the patient, from a curve of the patient, from a curve of the patient, from a curve of the patient, from curve of the patient, from a curve of the patient, from a curve of the patient, from a curve of the patient, from a curve of the patient, from a curve of the patient
