Sun hasn't shone through my window for days
Dark cloud passed over, decided to stay
Coming down hard and I'm watching it pour
I'm stuck in the middle of a blue storm
Two weeks of dishes
Piled in the sink
Mail lies unopened
I just sit here and think
Try to get up
Then I wonder what for
I'm stuck in the middle of a blue storm
And the weatherman says clear skies today
But from where I sit all I see is rain
I know that I told you to leave me alone
Now all I want is for you to come home
'Cause the water keeps rising and I'm sinking down slow
I'm stuck in the middle of a blue storm
And the weatherman says
Gonna be clear skies today
But from where I sit
All I see is rain, rain, rain
Sun hasn't shone through my window for days
A dark cloud passed over, decided to stay
It's coming down hard and I'm watching it pour
I'm stuck in the middle of a blue
I'm stuck in the middle of a blue storm
