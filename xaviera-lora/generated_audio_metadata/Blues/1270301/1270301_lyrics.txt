One wish country blues
One wish country blues
That old Kentucky moon is having me bad
That soft two pillow sun is making me sad
Came rising like a great white wonder
And shook the world with blazing thunder
The brightest star in the sky ceased to shine
Left us stranded in the desert to cry
But when I was young I had one wish
I just had one wish
Wanted to be bigger than Elvis
Just seems to me the heroes are born to die
Born to die
Like their destiny is wrote high above the sky
Above the sky
He carried the world on his shoulders
Now he's gone the world's growing colder
Some laugh and said the king died on his throne
What makes me sad is that he died alone, died alone
For when I was young I had one wish
I just had one wish
I wanted to be bigger than Elvis
That's oh such a hard act to follow you know
It's a road filled with so much trouble and woe
You're climbing that steep hill to the top
You just can't let the wheel ever stop
You ot you're part of the human race
A town called fame is such a lonely place
Made so many others fall
Jimmy, Janice, Judy and all
They just couldn't fit
They took hit after hit
Till they could take no more
Till they leapt through that door
They just couldn't play that game
And it's a crying shame
Such a crying shame
When I was young
I had one wish
I just had one wish
One wish
I wanted to be bigger than Elvis
But his memory lives forever with me
Like it's yesterday in Memphis, Tennessee
The flowers bloom and the birds fly high
Airwaves play songs from a G .I.
Sent away to foreign and distant shores
We'll welcome him back with a lion's roar
For when I was young I had one wish
I just had one wish, one wish
I wanted to be bigger than Elvis
For when I was young I had one wish
I just had one wish
I wanted to be bigger than Elvis
Bigger than Elvis
Bigger than Elvis
