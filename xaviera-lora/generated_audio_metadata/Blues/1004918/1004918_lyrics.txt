My rent's due
What do I do now?
Rent's due
What do I do now?
She's running all around town
I feel like a damn clown
Rent's due
Baby, why you at my door?
Oh no, you ain't coming home
'Cause I thought that you knew
That we were all through
Goodbye
Rent is coming due
I don't know what to do
If you have a spare room
Maybe I'll come stay with you
My rent's due
My rent's due
Rance due
Can you see me through
Rance due
Time to start anew
She took all my money
She's running with somebody
Oh well
My rent's due
What do I do now?
Mama, what do I do now?
She's running all around town
I feel like a damn clown
My rent's due
