After twenty odd plus long years gone by you still look at me
With those eyes that see right past my wrongs
And those ever loving arms still pull me in and hold me close
Each and every day like I've been gone too long
Oh when I look back I see two kids just jumping in
With both feet not asking what, if, why, when, or how
But just look at the two of us now
Your smile still lights up my every room
When our eyes meet it's still never too soon
You still go walking hand in hand
You still make me a better man
I'm still not asking what if, why, when or how
But just look at the two of us now
So many people we know said no it's way too hard
Or enough's enough
Just as soon as things got tough
Well I know you know it all ain't been no Hallmark card
But you should know I never ever even once gave up on us
Oh when I look back I see two kids just jumping in
With both feet not asking what if why when or how
But just look at the two of us now
Your smile still lights up my every room
When our eyes meet it's still never too soon
We still go walking hand in hand
You still make me a better man
I'm still not asking what if why when or how
But just look at the two of us now
Twenty plus years and 2 .5 kids later
It seems these days we talk a whole lot more about Legos and Darth Vader
Oh but your smile still lights up my every room
When our eyes meet it's still never too soon
We still go walking hand in hand
You still make me a better man
I'm still not asking what if why when or how
But just look at the two of us now
Look at the two of us now
Look at the two of us now, yeah
