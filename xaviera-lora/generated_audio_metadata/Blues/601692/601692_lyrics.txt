Don't fall for that woman, she won't stay too long
One blink of an eye, then she'll be gone
Don't fall for that woman, she'll take your heart and soul
Oh yeah
Chew you up, speed you out, but it's your call
Alright, she don't even know it
But she's hurting bad
Carrying the pain of love that makes her mad
Don't fall for that woman
She don't waste no time
No, no, no
Saying that she loves ya
Oh, but she's only lying
Oh yeah
Don't fall for that woman
She only bring you down
She's giving loving to every man in town
One minute she's your heaven
And then you'll hear, I know
I've been there, I know it very well
Don't fall for that woman
Alright brother
Keep on rollin'
Don't fall for that woman
She only brings you down
She's giving loving
To every man in town
One minute she's your heaven
And then your hell
I know it
Cause I've been there
I know it very well
'Cause I've been there, yeah, baby
Don't fall for that woman
