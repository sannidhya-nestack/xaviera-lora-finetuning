You went down to see your mama
Told her how bad you've been done
Well my life's gone downhill since you've been gone
I don't know what I've got in store
I put my foot through that devil's door
That old devil's dog
Well my bottles run dry
And I'm gonna try
Oh so hard
Mama please send that girl home to me
Well, I know what I've got in store
I'm gonna get back on the right side of that devil's door
That old devil's door, yeah
I'll be crying all night
I'll be crying all night
I'll be crying all night
I'll be crying all night
I'll be crying all night
I'll be crying all night
Well, I promised you, mama, now I'm so dry
That that sweet little girl of yours
No more tears shall she cry
Well I know now what's in store
Ain't gonna put my foot through
That old devil's door no more
That old devil's door no more
Well I'm begging you mama
I'm on my knees
That sweet loving girl of yours
No more worry will she need
Well I know now
What's in store ain't gonna put no foot through
That old devil's done no more
That old devil's done no more, no, no, no
I'm not afraid of the dark, I'm not afraid of the dark
