Old man river runs muddy and deep
Woman makes promises she don't keep
A hole in my pocket got money to burn
When it comes to that woman, never gonna learn
I believed in her promises
Broken promises, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
An old man river run muddy and deep
My girl making promises that she can't keep
As soon as I'm broke there ain't no doubt
That some other man be taking her out
She believes in her promises
Broken promises
Broken promises
The old man river run muddy and deep
My baby's making promises she won't keep
Fishnet stockings and red spike heels
She ain't no church girl but I knew the deal
Broken promises
Oh she broke those promises
Oh yeah
Mmm-hmm
Oh broken promises
Now old man river run muddy and deep
She's making me promises she can't keep
When it comes to the woman I know I'm gonna lose
I'm strolling down Beale street now singing my blues
She made me promises
She broke those promises
Oh she made me promises
And broke all her promises
And broken promises
