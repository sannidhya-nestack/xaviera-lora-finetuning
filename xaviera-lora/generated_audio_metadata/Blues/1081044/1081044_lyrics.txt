You were hacked down baby
Pulled out by your stems
Your buds were ripped off
Your trunk was stomped in
He clipped off your limbs
And threw'em all in the fire
But you're blossoming baby
You're still living still
You're growing and blooming, expanding and flowering
You're blossoming baby, it's a whole new world
You're blossoming baby
It's been a drought baby
No water from the can
No fertilizer fed you
And the aphids all came in
No burlap to protect you
No roast food I have
But you're blossoming, baby
You're still living still
You're growing and blooming, expanding and flowering
You're blossoming, baby
It's a whole new world
You're blossoming, baby
You had a saw on you, baby
You've been cut with a knife
He's been abusive, baby
You've had nothing but strife
You thought you had nothing
But your rose bush, babe
You're blossoming, baby
You're still living still
You're growing and blooming, expanding and flowering, you're blossoming baby
It's a whole new world, you're blossoming baby
It's a whole new world, you're blossoming baby
It's a whole new world, you're blossoming baby
