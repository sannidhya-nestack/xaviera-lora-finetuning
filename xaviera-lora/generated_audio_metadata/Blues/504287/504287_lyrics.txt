I'm a big girl now
Oh, I'm a big girl now
I pay my own damn bills and find my own cheap thrills
I'm a big girl now
Oh, I'm a big girl now
Don't need no help, no how
Hey, I can run my own life, won't be nobody's old wife
I'm a big girl now
When I was a little girl
I was taught to stand alone
And like the lady said
God bless the child that's got her own
Don't need no one to bail me out
Oh, I know what it's all about
No one can knock me down
I have been around
And I'm a big girl now
Don't need no one to bail me out
Yes, I know what it's all about
No one can knock me down'cause I have been around
And I'm a big girl now
No one to tell me what to do
No one to start me feeling blue
Oh, I can sleep all day and dance the night away
And spend my time with who knows who
You know I must confess, there are some times I realize
If some big boy would come along and help me sing my song
He'd cut this big girl down to size
