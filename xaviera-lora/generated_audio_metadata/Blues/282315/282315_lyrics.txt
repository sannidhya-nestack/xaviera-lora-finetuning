I want camel cash
I want it right away
I want that camel cash
Saved up for a rainy day
That way if I get into trouble
I can still go a long, long way
When I get to an oasis
I wanna save up as much as I can
That way I won't get stuck
Out there in the burning sand
I want that camel cash
I want it right away
I got to put it in the bank every time I get a buck
Because you never know when you'll run out of luck
I won't play my life like a gambling fool
My daddy told me horses was the golden rule
My friends might say I'm so miserly
They always come around when they're out of money
I want that camel cash
I want it stashed away
That way I got something for that rainy day
I'm gonna be just like the squirrels who worked all summer long
That way when the winter comes they can be safe and warm
I call it camel cash
Stashed away
That way if I get into trouble
I got something for that rainy day
