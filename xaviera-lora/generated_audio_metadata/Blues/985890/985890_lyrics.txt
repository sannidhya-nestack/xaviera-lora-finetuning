I don't miss you at all, I never think of you
The marks on the wall are not something new
There was a photo there I didn't want anymore
And I really don't care what you think you saw
I don't miss you at all, you slip beneath my bed
Maybe yours or mine, I use them instead
You feel your presence here, well that's more than I do
Of you I've got no fear, you're just making me blue
I don't miss you at all
The tears I cry at night
Wet my pillow through
Are not to do with you alright
I don't miss you at all
I cry when I speak to my friends
And I don't miss you at all
And now this message ends
