Me and the fellas were out one night
Chasing the moon, seeing the sights
Then we fell in the place on the street
Having a taste, feeling the beat
Not our normal water, some could tell
But it didn't matter, we had some time to kill
Then you walked, oh, into our sights
And the hunt was on, it was a Saturday night
The way you moved, the way you talked
The things you said, Lord, the way you walked
The way you smiled, the way you sighed
Lord, you know it made a grown man cry
Ooh-ah-ooh-ay-ah
Ooh-ah-ooh-ay-ah
Ooh-ah-ooh-ay-ah
All the suburban knights took their test
Each man stood and tried
All he did is his best
But with each step they just turned around
They took their shots and they sat on down
I shook my head as I watched the fair
I've had my rise before you know we all have been there
Then you turned and you walked my way
And I couldn't think of anything else to say
The way you move, the way you talk
The things you say, Lord, the way you walk
The way you smile, the way you sigh
Lord, you know you make a grown man cry
Oh you turned and you walked away
Saving us all from a rainy day
Giving us something to talk about
Oh the lunch hour you know that word of mouth
Years from now the story will change
Someone will call out with a solemn refrain
Do you remember that night of long ago
I'll say yes and long may the story be told
The way he moved, the way he talked
The things he said, Lord, the way he walked
The way he smiled, the way he sighed
Lord, you know it made a grown man cry
Ooh-ah-ooh-ay-ah
Ooh-ah-ooh-ay-ah
Ooh-ah-ooh-ay-ah
Ooh-ah-ooh-ay-ah (x4)
