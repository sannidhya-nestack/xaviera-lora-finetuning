Hush now sweet daddy
Don't you worry anymore
Hush now sweet daddy
Don't you worry anymore
While you're here with me tonight baby
We got no place else to go
Yeah, and I just wanna take you in my arms
And rock you nice and slow
I just want to take you in my arms
And rock you nice and slow
Don't you worry about anything baby
Stay right here, stay right here with me awhile
Yes it can be a mean old cold world out there
Even when the sun is shining bright
Well it can be a mean cold
It can be so cold out there baby
Even when the sun is shining bright
Everything is just fine daddy
When you're lying here in my arms tonight
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Come out of the cold city now
Ooh, ooh, ooh
While you're here with me, sweet daddy
You know everything is just alright
Well, and I've been looking high and low
Everywhere I go
Nobody out there I like like you, oh, oh, daddy
Heaven knows
Hush now, sweet daddy
Don't you worry anymore
Well, it might be a mean old cold world out there
But right now everything, everything is just alright
It's just, it's just, ooh baby, it's just alright
