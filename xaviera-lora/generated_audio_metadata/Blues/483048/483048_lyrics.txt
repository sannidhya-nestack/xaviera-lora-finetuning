Magnolia trees lining the avenue
There's nowhere better in July
When you get here I know you'll wanna stay
On a Louisiana lazy day
Hey we can go and take a fishing pole
Down by the riverside
And it won't matter if the fish don't bite
We'll buy some cold fish pie or even eat some jambalaya
Everything is going my way
On a loosey and a lazy day
Now we can go and take a fishing pole
Down by the river side
It don't matter if those fish don't bite
We'll buy some crawfish pie or even eat some jambalaya
Well every little thing is gonna go my way
On a loosey and a lazy day
Zippity doo dah zippity yay
Every little thing is gonna go my way
On a Louisiana lazy day
A Louisiana lazy day
Mmm, ooh-da-da-doo-da-da
Ooh-da-da, ooh-da-da
