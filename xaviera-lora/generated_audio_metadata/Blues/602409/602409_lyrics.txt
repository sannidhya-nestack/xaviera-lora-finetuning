Ooh, so something's missing from where you are, ah-ah-ah
Ooh, something's coming from the deepest part of your heart, ah-ah-ah
Come on baby, tonight you're riding with me
Road is calling and night is falling
The sirens all out
Ooh let's feel the night till we see the morning light
Come out
Ooh it's like voodoo
Coming right through you
Don't worry baby tonight you're riding with me
Hey!
Come on around here
Girl, come on, ring me up (ring me up, ring me up, ring me up, ring me up)
And I'll be your ringer
Oh, take us somewhere where I don't care
Running for the money
You'll get out of breath, honey
It'll take you down, ah-ah-ah
When it comes right down to it
Gotta just skip down and do it
It's a sensation, ah-ah-ah
It's time baby
Tonight you're riding with me
Yeah, hey, hey, hey
