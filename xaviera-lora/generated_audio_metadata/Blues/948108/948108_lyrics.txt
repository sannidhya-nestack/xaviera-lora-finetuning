Thunder and lightning inside my head
Why did we start fighting?
That's my one regret, can't et
Bright where the colors are
Bad since you've been gone
The sky has turned to dulling
Can't hide from the storm, I'm battered and torn
Only you could keep me warm
I close my eyes and count to ten
Thinking I could make it end
But it's here to stay
Tears fall like rain
I close my eyes, block out the view
But that don't take away these blues
Only the dark clouds remain
I keep on praying
But my fate is so bruised
From inside it's raining
Soon rain turns to frost
I'm playing on the coast
Surrounded by the senseless
I close my eyes and count to ten
Thinking I could make it in
But it's here to stay
Tears fall like rain
I close my eyes, block out the view
Death don't take away these blues
There's no escape
Escape from my biggest mistake
I close my eyes, I can't detect
I think a knife could make it end
But it's here to stay
This fall, I agree
I close my eyes, walk out the view
But they don't take away these blues
Only the dark clouds remain
Tears falling down like rain
Only the dark clouds remain
