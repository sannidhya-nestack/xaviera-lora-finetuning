If I only had the nerve
If I only had the nerve
If I only had the nerve
If I only had the nerve
I'd kiss that little girl
Underneath the crescent moon
Stuck here in the working world
Driving me insane
I just need a little girl
To ease up on my pain
She could make it all feel right
If I only had the nerve
If I only had the nerve
If I only had the nerve
If I only had the nerve
If I only had the nerve
I'd kiss that little girl
Underneath the crescent moon
Go out to the local bar
Try to have some fun
That won't get me very far
Too shy to get it done
I could make it work out right
If I only had the nerve
If I only had the nerve
If I only had the nerve
If I only had the nerve
If I only had nerve I'd kiss that little girl
Underneath the crescent moon
Stuck here in the working world
Driving me insane
I just need a little girl
To ease up on my pain
She could make it all feel right
If I only had the nerve
If I only had the nerve
If I only had the nerve
If I only had the nerve
If I only had the nerve
I'd kiss that little girl
Underneath the crescent moon
