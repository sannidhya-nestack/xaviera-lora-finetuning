I'm not the kind to walk away
I'm not the kind to turn and run
I'm not the kind to simply say
This situation ain't no fun
Go on and hate me when we may
I'm gonna love you anyway
You've got that fire in your eye
You've got that flame upon your tongue
You've got that thousand dollar smile
When you say the end has come
Well go on and hate me Willie Mae
Cause I'm gonna love you anyway
I've got my heart here in my hand
I've got some money for a ring
I've got to make you understand, baby
That I would do most anything
Go on and hate me willy may
Cause I'm gonna love you anyway
I may not have a hope in hell
I may not hold that lucky card
But heaven knows what time will tell
You'll always be my queen of hearts
Go on and hate me, Willie Mae
I'm gonna love you anyway
