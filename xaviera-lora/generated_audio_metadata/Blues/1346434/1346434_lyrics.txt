I'm itchin' (I'm itchin') itchin' for something new
I'm itchin' (I'm twitchin') for some change in the news
I'm itchin', I'm scratchin'
To see something new hatchin'
Oh, I'm itchin' (I'm itchin') for something new
I'm waitin' (I'm waitin') for the page to turn
I'm waitin' (It's frustrating) my life's on slow burn
I'm waiting, I'm biting
Biting my time that keeps sliding
I'm waiting (I'm waiting) for that pitch to turn
I'm yearning (I'm yearning) I feel it in my soul
I'm yearning (heart's burning) oh I want to roll
I'm yearning, I'm craving
Something dear, sanity saving
I'm yearning, I'm yearning
I'll be ready, my soul, get tall
I'm itchin' for a new dose
Itchin' in repetition
I want to be reborn
I'm itchin' I'm scrapin'
Nothing much new happenin'
Oh, I'm itchin' (I'm itchin') oh, honey, no (I'm itchin')
I'm itchin' I'm scrapin'
Nothing much new happenin'
Oh, I'm itchin' (I'm itchin') oh, honey, no (I'm itchin')
I'm itchin'
I'm scraping, nothing much new happening
No, I'm itching for a new dawn
I'm itching, I'm itching for something new
For something new, for something new
