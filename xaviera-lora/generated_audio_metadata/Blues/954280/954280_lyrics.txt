I have to break free
I need to run from a cold hearted man
A cold hearted man
I'll leave that cold hearted man
Just watch out here I come
Bitter and twisted, bad through and through
Such a cold hearted man, a cold hearted man
He's a cold hearted man that treated me so cruel
Write it in a letter, call him on the phone
Tell him I ain't ever, ever coming home
Say it's finally over, the finish line in sight
I found my destination, breaking free tonight
From a cold hearted man
A cold hearted man
I'll lead that cold hearted man
Make everything alright
Just watch me fly alright
That's right
I'm breaking free tonight
Ah
Ooh
Writing in a letter, calling on the phone
Tell him I ain't ever, ever coming home
See it's finally over, the finish line in sight
I found my destination
Breaking free tonight from a cold hearted man
A cold hearted man
Escape the cold hearted man
And leave him far behind
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
He's a cold hearted man
A cold hearted man
He's a cold hearted man
That treated me so cool
Alright
