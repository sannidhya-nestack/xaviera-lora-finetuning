In the lesson of love, there's a lot to learn
Everybody's got their long sad story
Little heart break, little heart burn
These things go with the territory
But when it's all said and done, I got no regret
Wanna learn how to swim, you gotta expect to get wet
I won't even remember your name
A hundred years from now, ooh yeah, a hundred years from now
Well, I was just another toy for your affection
Just another sucker for a phony Valentine
Just another doll in your collection
Just another psyche on your disassembly line
You broke my heart
You did me wrong
I may be devastated but not for long
I won't even remember your name
A hundred years from now
Ooh yeah, a hundred years from now
Soon you'll be yesterday's news
And I don't dwell in the past
I'll just chalk you up to experience
You weren't my first, won't be my last
Gotta kiss you some frogs before you find you a prince
A heart too eager to hope offers no resistance
A heart too eager to love tends to romanticize
But now I see you more closely from a distance
Tell you the truth you ain't no big prize
To lend perspective to this melodrama
In the book of love you're just a karma
I won't even remember your name
A hundred years from now
Ooh, yeah, a hundred tears from now
No, I won't even remember your name
A hundred tears from now
Ooh, yeah
