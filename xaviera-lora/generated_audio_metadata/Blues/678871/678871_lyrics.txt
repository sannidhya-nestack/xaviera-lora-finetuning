Well, I've been on my own And I know what it's like
At night you're alone with no end in sight
But it's not that bad at the end of the day
When I look around me and I know that I'm safe
How many times have you told me you're sorry
How many times have I let you back in
How many times have I heard your sad story
With tears in your eyes
How many times
Well I've been on the floor
And I know what it's like
Can't get to the door
Can't stand up and fight
Will you scream and abuse me
I'd whimper and cry
But last time it hit me
Get out or you'll die
And how many times have you told me you're sorry
How many times have I let you back in
How many times have I heard your sad story
With tears in your eyes
How many times
Well, I've been in love and I know what it's like
You give up your soul, it don't put up a fight
And one day you find out the loving ain't right
And you can't remember how it felt when he held you and kissed you and loved you, yeah
How many times, yeah
How many times I gotta let you back in
How many times have I heard your sad story
With tears in your eyes
How many times, mmm
Oh, how many times
Gotta get away
Gotta get away from your love
Oh how many times
