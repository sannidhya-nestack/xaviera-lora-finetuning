I stomp the drum kit
Jump at the broomstick
Click at the chopsticks
Gave my guitar a whole new set of strings
Tell you for nothing I gonna be here
Till the last trumpet sings
Tell you for nothing I gonna be here
Till the last trumpet sings
When I was young I didn't care
I take my women like I take my stairs
Two at a time I swear
Two at a time not that I swear
Two at a time I swear
Two at a time not that I swear
I kick the habit
Bunny the rabbit
Stupid to grab it
Before giving my zbd a whole new set of springs
And I'll tell you for nothing
I'm gonna be here
Till the last trumpet sings
The last trumpet sings
Tonight the moonlight's like a cup and I just want to butter you
I found drink or did drink find me
I wonder who'd ever play me in a movie
I found drink or did drink find me
I wonder who'd ever play me in a movie
I took the biscuit
Decided to risk it
Told the boss to stick it
Said to Leslie give me your number
I'll promise I'll give you a ring
And tell you for nothing I'm gonna be here
Till the last trumpet sings
Till the last trumpet sings
I'm gonna be here
Till the last trumpet sings
I've had a flash of brilliance
A pivotal moment in my career
I've reached my destination
I've got everything I want here
I've reached my destination
I've got everything I want here
I've reached my destination
I've got everything I want here
I've reached my destination
I've got everything I want here
Yeah
