Every time I sit and wonder, I end up with the blues
Every time I sit and wonder, I end up with the blues
Well, the truth is never meant to get never left to lose
Wouldn't have one bit of trouble if the world would go my way
Wouldn't have one bit of trouble to walk on my way
But the problem only seem to come when they don't care what I say
Wouldn't have one bit of trouble if the world go my way
Wouldn't have one bit of trouble if the world goes my way
Well problems always seem to come when they don't hear what I say
Every time I sit and wonder I end up with a bruise
Every time I sit and wonder, I end up with the blues
Well, the truth is nothing ventured, you've got nothing left to lose
Yeah, the truth is nothing ventured, you've got nothing left to lose
The truth is nothing ventured, you've got nothing left to lose
