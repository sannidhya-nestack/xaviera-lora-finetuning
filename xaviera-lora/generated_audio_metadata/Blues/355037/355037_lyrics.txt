I heard you sneak into the bedroom
In the middle of the night
I got a low down suspicion
That what you're doing ain't right
I smell some brand new cologne
Ooh, it ain't Chanel number five
I just know you're up to evil
You've got that look in your eyes
So you better walk softly baby
Don't you step on this heart of mine
You've got a nasty need to ramble
But you better watch who you see
You never know who's'round the corner
Might be a fool just like me
So you better walk softly baby don't you step on this heart of mine
I feel the sweat on the trigger
I feel the chill in the night
I might just say it was a prowler
Who stumbled right into my sights
So you better walk softly baby don't you
Step on this heart of mine
Yeah you better walk softly baby don't you
Step on this heart of mine
