Hey you, you should be glad that he walked out on you
After all the stress that man put you through
Instead of sitting there wondering who he's loving now
Don't you think it's time
To put that memory down
Unnecessary heartache
Unnecessary pain
Take off those shackles
Break off those chains
Girl if you still want him
Your heart ain't got no brain
Unnecessary heartache
Unnecessary pain
Why don't you start looking out for number one?
Stop your feeling guilty
For something you ain't done
You treated him so kindly
And he treated you like dirt
Get back in circulation
And find someone you deserve
Unnecessary heartache
Unnecessary pain
Take off those shackles
Break off those chains
Girl, if you still want him
Your heart ain't got no brain
Unnecessary heartache
Unnecessary pain
Oh what would it take to shake him off your heart
How can I convince you that now's the time to start
Unnecessary heartache
Unnecessary pain
Take off those shackles
Break off those chains
Girl if you still want him
Your heart ain't got no brain
Unnecessary heartache, unnecessary pain
Unnecessary heartache, unnecessary pain
