I feel so good, you make me high
I feel so good, love never lies
There ain't no doubt about it
You're the only one for me
Yeah baby, you're the light in me
When I'm traveling away from home
I feel your love, I'm never alone
Through the fog of life you help me see
Yeah baby, you're the light in me
No one could ever hold me and make me feel alive
The way you do
You ignite my inner feelings
That starts a chain reaction in me and you
You are the light
The light in me
You are the light
The light in me
When I was in my hour of darkness
You were the light
That guided me
Yeah baby
You're the light in me
No one could ever hold me and make me feel alive
The way you do
You ignite my inner feelings
That starts a chain reaction in me and you
You are the light
The light in me
You are the light
The light in me
You are the light
You are the light
You are the light
You are the light
