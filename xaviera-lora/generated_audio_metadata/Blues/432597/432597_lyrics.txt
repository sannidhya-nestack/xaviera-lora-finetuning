Sometimes I get so lonely, I touch the shadows on the wall
My friends they try to buy me, but they're no friends at all
If only I could stay free, and try to stand tall
I see the morning sunlight come screaming through my room
I feel the devil's cold eyes and smell his perfume
He shows me no mercy but I won't be fooled
I'm no fool
You can take away my guitar, but you can't take my soul
I was fooled right from the start
Was that just your goal?
And now you try to bring me
And laugh as I fall
Watch me fall
Sometimes I get so lonely
I talk to shadows on the wall
My friends they try to buy me
They're no friends at all
But I know I'll be free
I'm gonna stand tall
