I woke up to a whisper crawling down my wall
Smoke in the mirror, voices in the hall
There's a shadow on my porch with a crooked cane
He said, "Come on, son, time to catch that train"
Ride the jets, I found train
No ticket, no name, just the echo of pain
Lighting in my veins, whiskey on my breath
And a hymn for the devil that don't promise rest
Mama warned me once, don't stare at the crow
But I fed it bread with a crooked soul
Now I sleep with boots and a .45
And that train don't stop'til it eats me alive
I left the writing on the windowsill
Too cold to stay, too mean to kill
Every mile I bleed, every mile I fade
my sins run dry in the Delta clay
I saw my face in a river, refused to speak
Eyes like lanterns, burned out and weak
Carved my name in a stick of maw-tree
Said bury me deep where the crows fly free
I ride that dead southbound train
With rust on my heart and blood in the rain
No savior inside, no script to vest
Just a rattle of bones and a black silk dress
