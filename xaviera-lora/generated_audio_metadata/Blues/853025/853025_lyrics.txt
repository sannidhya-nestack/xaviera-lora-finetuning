I feel we've been down this lane before
Time it right and the wall will fall
And what you don't see now
I will tell you about
When you finally work it out
Afraid that it's not too late for you to turn yourself around
And then maybe you'll be before me
All things can change in a minute or two
Well it's been ten years, tell me now
What do you plan to do?
When the game that you played was a mistake that you made
But you made me and you made me well
So there must be something good inside the shells
Why don't you use it to be, be for me?
Woah, woah, woah
Yes you got to now
Use it to calm me down
Ooh, ooh
When you finally worked it out
I pray that it's not too late for you to turn yourself around
And then maybe you'll be before me
