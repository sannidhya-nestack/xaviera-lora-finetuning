Got my old six train, sitting by my side
I got a heart full of memories and a long road to ride
The sun sinking low, casting shadows on the ground
Searching for redemption, where can it be found
The winds are calling with a lonesome sound
Each note I play tries to bring me'round
I've been traveling on this weary track
Gonna find my way, there's no turning back
Stars are whispering secrets in the night
I'm chasing them dreams, trying to make it right
Got my motor running as the moonlight leaks
In the rearview mirror I see my yesterday's receipt
The winds are calling with a long slow sound
Each note I play tries to bring me round
I've been traveling on this weary track
Gonna find my way, there's no turning back
Every tear I've shed has paved my way
Turning dust to diamonds in the light of day
A river of love is singing in my veins
Feeling every heartbeat, dancing in the rain
Dawn is breaking on a brand new day
The load is lighter now since I found my way
With the echo of the past, a lesson learned
Playing my own song as the fires burn
The winds are callin' with a lonesome sound
It's not our way, tries to bring me around
I've been trapped, I've been sweetly trapped
But I found my way, ain't no lookin' back
