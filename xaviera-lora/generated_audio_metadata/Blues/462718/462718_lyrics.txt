Well, I traveled the world with stars in my eyes
But now I'm lost in the clouds
I've fallen, I've fallen, I've fallen so far
I was almost home
This place is so white bread
Ain't no grain to go against
We'll just eat your humble pie
Scream inside until you die
All the women were looking with told you so eyes
When I slunk into town
You've fallen, you've fallen, you've fallen so far
You flew too close to the sun
This place is so wide spread, ain't no grain to go against
We'll just eat your humble pie and scream inside until you die
I once had a girlfriend who said she was a witch
That she'd show me when we left town
But her father was poorly with not long to live
So she had to hang around
This place is so white bread, ain't no grain to go against
We just eat your humble pie and cry inside until you die yeah
This place is so white bread, ain't no grain to go against
We just eat your humble pie and scream inside until you die, until you die
I can hear her by the river in the caravan park
She's playing a blues guitar
She's singing you have fallen quit stalling so what
There's goodness in the ground
This place is so white bread, ain't no grain to go against
But just eat your humble pie and scream inside until you die, till you die
Till you die, till you die, till you die
