Between one and two, two and three
Between the people that I've ever been
Right and wrong, cool and keen
Between the chaos and the sanctuary
Just between you and me
Just between you and me, I'm in between
Between a substance and a style
Between a sorrow and a smile
An angel and a demon's guile
Between the funeral and the trial
Just between you and me
Just between you and me, I'm in between
