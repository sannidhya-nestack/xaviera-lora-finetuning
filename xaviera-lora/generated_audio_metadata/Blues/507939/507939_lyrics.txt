I've been gone too long, gone too long from you
I've been gone too long, gone too long from you
Well my heart was aching
Now it's broken too
Well I left that town
Left on rainy day
Well, I left that town, left one rainy day
Had to leave you, baby, had to find my way, yeah
Leave that town, leave that
Well the days drank on nights all on some tune
Yes the days drank on nights all on some tune
And I will return but
Will I ever find you?
I don't know, no, no, yeah
I've been gone too long
Gone too long from you
Yes I've been gone too long
Gone too long from you
Well my heart was aching
Now it's broken too
