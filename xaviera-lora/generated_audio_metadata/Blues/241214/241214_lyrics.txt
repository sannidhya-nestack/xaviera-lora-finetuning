And I do know the road is gonna be long
And I do know my chances for beaming it
I don't want to find land where I can't stay there
People running scared, why you running scared
It's not gonna get you nowhere
Won't take you nowhere
Till you do end it
We gonna rise up and make us stand
And if you're down, you better pick you up
And if you're thirsty, you can share my cup (share my cup)
And if you're hungry, I help you look for food (look for food)
And if you're lonely, for you I'll sing the blues
I said people are running scared, why are you running scared?
It's not gonna take you nowhere
Won't get you nowhere
Turn you to anger
We gotta rise up and make a stand
People run and scare
People running scared
People running scared
People running scared
