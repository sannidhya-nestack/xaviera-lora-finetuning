Rescue me, but you don't have to save my soul
Rescue me, but you don't have to save my soul
I've just been hanging around too long
Make me feel kinda old
Look all around me
All that I see is so
Look all around me
All that I see is so
But this you got the heart of a lion girl
And I know you'll never fold
Trust me baby, don't I stand in your garden'til I die
Trust me baby, don't I stand in your garden'til I die
No one ever loved me like you do, and that's a word of a lie
