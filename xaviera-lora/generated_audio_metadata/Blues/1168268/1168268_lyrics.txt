I'm gonna sing a little song about my philosophy
Well, it's really simple, but it works for me, yeah
Whenever I feel blue, I'll shed a tear or two or three
And then I'll head right down to where I wanna be
I just go down, down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down down
Down to the sea
Mmm, baby, baby, won't you come with me?
I got two cent dollars and the sun is free, yeah
You know I'm wishin' on a starfish, you fall in love with me
But if you break my heart, well what'll be will be
(whistling)
Well, once upon a time
I used to pine and sigh all day
I had a mean, mean daddy
What more can I say, yeah
But that was long ago
You know I found a better way
I watched the waves rolling
And wash my cares away
I just go down, down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
Down to the sea
Where good times bad times
Life's a melody
Like the changing colors of the endless sea
And I want to sing it with you in perfect harmony
But if you break my heart, well, it'll be, will be
(Whistling)
