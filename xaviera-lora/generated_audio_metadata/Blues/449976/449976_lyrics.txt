Today is February second
Here in Punxsutawney, PA
I got snow drips up to my belly button
Sure is a cold mean day
Groundhog Phil ain't seen his shadow
But he got the blues anyway
No one knockin' at my door, baby
I'm just as sad as sad can be
I've got only one companion
His name is Mr. Misery
Now he's sitting right beside me
But he ain't my cup of tea
Ever since my baby left me
I've said it almost every night
Just thinking about all the things I've done wrong
Hoping somehow to make'em right
But it's been a month of Sundays
And there ain't no end in sight
