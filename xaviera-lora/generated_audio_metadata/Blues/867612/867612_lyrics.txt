When a man's felt like a rooster
Creaming and dandified
Chasing all the other little birds
Wait, won't let that lie
She'll be reaching for the poison
She'll be reaching for a gun
To catch you with another little burrow
Gonna see where the vengeance done
You may shake your head and argue
But you know deep down it's true
There's no greater force of nature
Than when a woman sings the blues, sings the blues
When a woman done gone left a man he'll moan and wail a while
But if a man done done leave it while I go on sit and cry
She'll be moving on, moving on, showing that she's strong enough
To walk away from the grave she dug to bury her boy we love
You may shake your head
But you know deep down it's true
There's no greater force of nature than when a woman sings the blues
Sings the blues
Well now judge you have to put aside the prejudice of man
Whose lust don't mean it's justified to philander all he can
And not expect a woman whose loyalty's abused
To ride in rage and track you down with a bitch or if you
May shake your head and argue but you know deep down it's true
There's no greater force of nature than when a woman sings the blues
Sings the blues
You may shake your head and argue
But you know deep down it's true
There's no greater force of nature
Than when a woman sings the blues
Sing the blues, sing the blues
Shake your head and argue
But you know you'll hear a singer blues
