Well, she didn't like my curtains
She moved my things from here to there
She made me get a job
She even made me cut my hair
She dressed me in the morning
She dressed me up at night
Hey, it didn't take no rocket scientist
To see this wasn't right
This time war on beyond a shadow of a doubt
Well, I could see what the boys tried to warn me about
As she moved in
My guitar moved out
Lord, it's out of here
Well as months rolled by our love turned into hate
I miss playing my guitar I miss staying out late
I took all I could take till I couldn't stand no more
I quit my job picked up my guitar and showed her the door
This time we were on beyond the shadows without
Wish she could see what her girlfriends had told her about
As my guitar moved in I made her move out
As my guitar came home, I made her move out
As my guitar moved in, I made her move out
