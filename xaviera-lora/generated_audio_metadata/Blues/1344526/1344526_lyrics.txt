Somebody got a brand new toy
Shaking you by them short hairs, boy
She been throwing her weight around
You don't know whether you're up or down
She got the switch to make you itch
You better start giving up
To love, sweet love
Love, sweet love
Now it may have all started as a physical thing
But after the honey here comes the sting
Apprehable though it seemed at first
You'll never get enough to quench that thirst
Kickin' your ass, you just can't pass
You better start giving it up
Love, sweet love
Love, sweet love
Now believe me, buddy, it's an angel scene
The jaws of a trap made the first machine
You know you're in trouble when you're sitting by the phone
Waiting for a ring, spending the night all alone
Now she got control, a part of your soul
Gonna start giving it up to love
Sweet love, yeah the love
Sweet love
