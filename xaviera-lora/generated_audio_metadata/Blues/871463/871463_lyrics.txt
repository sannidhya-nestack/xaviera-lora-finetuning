I'm not the kind of woman that won't stand by her man
So when you begged me on your knees I gave you one more chance
But your running round dragged me down right into goodbye
Sorry, sorry won't work this time
Save your apologies, that dog won't hunt again
Don't come a-scratchin' on my door'cause I won't let you in
You can swear you've learned your lesson
Cross your heart and hope to die
Sorry, sorry, won't work this time
You want me to ive and et
Well I ive myself for loving you
et we ever met
Don't look at me with crocodile tears in your eyes
Sorry, sorry won't work this time
No thank you for the roses, it's too late for that
You've got a snowball's chance and well I just don't want you back
Now that my eyes are open wide, I see that love's not blind
Sorry, sorry won't work this time
You want me to ive and et
Well, I ive myself for loving you
et we ever met
Don't look at me with crocodile tears in your eyes
Sorry, sorry, won't work this time
You can swear you've learned your lesson
Cross your heart and hope to die
Sorry, sorry, won't work this time
Sorry, sorry won't work this time
Sorry, sorry won't work this time
Sorry, sorry, sorry
Sorry won't work this time
Sorry, sorry, sorry
