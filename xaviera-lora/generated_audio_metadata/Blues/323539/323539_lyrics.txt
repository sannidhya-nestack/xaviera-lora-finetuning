She got those big green eyes, that long red hair
Got everything together, don't you know she got those kind of crazy skin
Gold on her fingers and diamonds'round her neck
When she picks me up in that Lincoln, Lord I feel so privileged
She's strutting fine, those long and tight legs
Silk-toothed caresses that there forming in the bed
Well her voice strokes my every move
Those words she says just puts me in the mood
She's my girl and I'm her man
Well she's my 24 karat
A future planned
I laid down with her, had days in
Her touch and warmth made me feel just like a fan
I hope she knows the way I feel
Can't tell her enough now I love you my dear
She's my girl and I'm her man
Well she's my 24 karat future plan
Her soul ignites a flame inside of my heart I thought was dead
She's my girl and I'm her man
She's my twenty-fourth carriage, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
View to play, yeah, yeah
