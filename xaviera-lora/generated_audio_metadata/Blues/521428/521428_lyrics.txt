I think that I'll go fishing
And stay away all year
all them politicians
They be sayin' things that I don't wanna hear
Every election year they tell you what you wanna hear
Just until they get elected
Say they gonna rearrange but nothin' ever seem to change
So I'm gone fishin' all year
I don't care what party they come from
Or the policy they proclaim
They want their power and they gonna get some
Cause ego tripping is the name of their game
I had to quit Facebook and Twitter
Cause they be lying when they tweet
They're born up by bull spitters
So I'm gonna catch up on some sleep
Wake me up when it's over
They're really just the same nominee
Nothing but a bunch of red rovers
On a paid vacation up in DC
So I'll just do me some fishing
Stay away all year
all the politicians
Stop saying things that I don't wanna hear no way
Every election year gonna tell you what you want to hear
Just so to get elected
Lame brain slogans got me gaggin' and joking
So I'm gone fishin' all year
