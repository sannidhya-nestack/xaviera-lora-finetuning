You claim the law'cause you've seen the best fall
We give you a case of the blues, baby
You've gotta choose her or me, devotee
Just like the way we used to be
Ba-ba-ba-da-da-da-ba-da-da-da-da-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
(scatting)
Proclaim your flaws
Give yourself an overhaul
I give you a case of the blues
You just need a new muse
I guarantee you will be
A little more likely carefree
Endgame, withdraw
Another chance to recall
We all got a case of the blues
Lately that's been the news
Please give me less debris
A big old change could set me free
No, baby, baby, give me a kiss
One, baby, baby, every, every day, every day
You give me one kiss of the goose that did it and nailed him
I'll live in a bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble
