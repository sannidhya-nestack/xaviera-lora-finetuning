First mistake I made was loving you
Sick and mistaken me for love without you
Look the worst mistaken me for the sound that I do
The woman bathing sink or shape of it all over her still
The woman bathed in sacred syrup, it all over her skin
And I make love to her every part of my body stain
She hear the devil's daughter, she caught on like the song
She's the devil's daughter, she go to make a song
Whiskey, wine and gasoline is what she used to baptize
My only song
I'm gonna go, buy me a shotgun
I'm gonna want my, go to buy me a, gun
Don't walk on it, not kill me, I walk out from now on
She and the devil daughter, she go down like the sun
She and the devil daughter, she go down like the sun
Whiskey, wine and gasoline
Is what she used to babble to my own last song
