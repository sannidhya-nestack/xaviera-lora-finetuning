We had some good times, you know it's true
I made you feel things that you never knew
You picked up and left me at a quarter to two
You left me lying here like yesterday's news
We ain't through, I've got some unfinished business with you
I gave you all I had, I put myself on the line
Seemed like I was giving all of the time
Got one more thing to give you, I'm able to find you
I'm gonna give you a piece of my mind
You picked up and flew, I got someone finished business with you
You gon' have to face me some day
You know you've got some dues to pay
At the haul that we've been through
I think that you could spare me a minute or two
You were my lover and my friend
I never asked for love till the end
You never promised to always be true
But I deserve better than this from you
You're picked up and flew
I got some unfinished business this year
We had some good times, you know it's true
I made you feel things that you never knew
You picked up and left me at a quarter to two
You left me lying here like yesterday's news
We ain't through, I got some unfinished business with you
Unfinished business (got some unfinished business)
We got some unfinished business (got some unfinished business)
We got some unfinished business (got some unfinished business)
Unfinished business (got some unfinished business)
We ain't through
We got some unfinished business with you
You picked up and flew
I got some unfinished business with you
We ain't through, I've got some unfinished business with you
