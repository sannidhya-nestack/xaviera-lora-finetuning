Blue moon on the horizon and the sun is sinking low
Blue moon on the horizon and the sun is sinking low
I've been talking to my baby, says it's time for me to go
Been a long time coming, well I should have known the score
Locked up, come in, and I should have known the score
With no money and no job, things ain't working out no more
It's been five years, baby, since we started down the road
Five long years since we started down the road
Things gone from bad to worse and it's time for me to go
I take a walk out in the moonlight, cast no shadow at your door
Walk out in the moonlight, cast no shadow at your door
Put my things in a little cloth bag, I ain't coming back no more
Yes, I love you, baby, morning, noon and night
Love you, baby, morning, noon and night
Looks like I've used up all my luck
Gonna leave you alone tonight
So we can see me someday, baby, dressed up and looking fine
See me, baby, dressed up, looking fine
Don't be ashamed to tell your friends
The man used to be mine
