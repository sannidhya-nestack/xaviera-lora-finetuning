I could get used to this
I'm telling you
I could get used to this
Oh, the way you're loving me
It fits just like a glove
Oh, your sweet love
It's easy, it's easy on me
I could get used to this
Think I already am
So come to me baby, take my hand, give me a kiss
Ooh, I could get used to this
Sweet connection right from the start
I knew deep down in my heart
My love is right here for you alone
So bring it on, bring it on home
I could get used to this
In fact I already am
So come sit next to me baby
Let me hold your hand and give you a kiss
Ooh, I could get used to this
Sweet connection, right from the start
I knew deep down in my heart
My love is right here for you alone
So bring it on, bring it on home
I could get used to this
I'm telling you I could get used to this
The way you're loving me
It fits just like a glove
Oh your sweet love
It's easy, easy on me
I could get used to this
I think I already am
So come to me baby
And let me hold your hand
Let me give you a kiss
Ooh, I could get used to this, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
