In the capital, men are hanging around
Thinking up new ways to keep us down
But you and me baby ain't gonna fuss and fight
Make no dirty deals, we'll be up this night
In the back alley, early past midnight
In the boardrooms, conversations on their minds
Few more bucks than what I hoped to find
We're gonna search for the key to these blues
To unlock our minds and set our spirits loose
In the back alley, in the back alley past midnight, midnight
In the back alley or in the backyard
We won't have to try too very hard
We're going to set ourselves free
Enjoy what is, don't worry about what should be
Oh, the mask in front is out of touch
It's what's behind the nose, what's what?
Gonna get inside the rhythm inside of us
We choose to live but dance we must
In the back alley, in the back alley
That's midnight, midnight, yeah
There's a rhythm to the natural world
Gets put you back in the daily world
Heartbeats are rushing down the street
We gotta get back to our retreat
Ooh, in the back alley, in the back alley
Last midnight, last midnight, last midnight
In the back alley
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
In the back alley, in the back alley
In the back alley passing midnight
