Clock on the wall says it's a quarter to two
And now the clock on the wall says it's a quarter to two
But you ain't missing me baby
you got something better to do
Well you been out all night
Well honey that ain't right
Well you been out all night
Well honey that ain't right
But I'm believing you baby
Come that first morning light
Well I've been hearing love songs
Playing on the radio
Well I've been hearing love songs playing on the radio
And what you're missing out on baby you don't even know
You can talk all you want, but baby, I'm a war
You can talk all you want, but baby ,I'm a war
And you was talking on deaf ears and I won't catch you when you fall
I'm talking to you baby, I said please come home
And now I'm talking to you baby, I said please come home
Cause when I think about your love I need one more for the road
And now the clock on the wall says it's a quarter to two
And now the clock on the wall says it's a quarter to two
you ain't missing me baby, but you got something better to do
