I got back to the flat found my laundry and the cat but no woman
To keep me warm
Just a note she wrote using words I shouldn't quote
She's leaving now she's gone
Now what do you do when your baby says you're through
And you're left with nothing to hold
Well my baby's out the door she ain't coming back for more
Now this room's getting mighty cold
And all I can say is
My baby's walking, she ain't talking
She just stepped and walked away
But I ain't squawking, I'm done mocking her ways
Ain't got a damn thing to say
But she's taking from me what I've been dreaming
Taking from me the love that gives me reason
Oh how I want her to stay
Well let me tell you about my baby
When we met I knew that maybe she would someday leave me holding the bag
I can't say she didn't warn me
But the shock has really torn me since she left my life's been really a drag
Now what do you do when your baby says you're through and you're left with nothing to hold
Well, my baby's out the door, she ain't comin' back for more
Now this room's gettin' mighty cold
I'll tell you one more time
My baby's walking, she ain't talking
She just stopped and walked away
But I ain't squawking, I'm done mocking her ways
Ain't got a damn thing to say
But she's taking from me what I've been dreaming
Taking from me the love that gives me reason
Oh how I want her to stay
Ah, you know I didn't like that bitch
Anyway
