I'm going down to the river, I'm gonna watch that river flow
You know the thing about a river is that it comes and it goes
Just like a Mississippi river flows into the Gulf of Mexico
Got to see my baby Lucy, she's living by the shore
One day she said she loved me, the next day she ain't so
Well, said she loved me, but it comes and it goes
Just like a Mississippi river flows into the Gulf of Mexico
Lucy tells her papa'bout the women that I know
And papa comes a-callin' with a shotgun through my door, yeah
Said she loved me (oh yeah) but it comes and it goes (it comes and it goes)
Just like a Mississippi river flows into the Gulf of Mexico
Ah, take me down, Joe
Got to see my baby Lucy, she's living by the shore
One day she said she loved me, next day she ain't sure
Said she loved me, but it comes and it goes (it comes and it goes)
Just like a Mississippi river flows into the Gulf of Mexico
I'm going down to the river (down to the river)
I'm gonna watch that river flow (watch the river flow)
You know the thing about a river (oh yeah)
Is that it comes and it goes (it comes and it goes)
Just like a Mississippi river flows into the Gulf of Mexico
Let's go down to the river (go down)
We're gonna watch that river flow (watch the river flow)
You know the thing about a river (oh yeah)
And that it comes and it goes (it comes and it goes)
Just like the Mississippi River flows into the Gulf of Mexico
Just like the Mississippi River
You know it comes and it goes
