Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down
But you can always turn me around, my sweet baby
You got that way with me
You're my one stop pick up when I need some TLC
Sometimes I'm lost, sometimes I'm found
But either way, you know I'm bound to meet you
You got that way with me
You're my North Star sailor in a stormy sea
There was a time I kept my front door locked
Double locked
Had a heart of gold
Guarded like Fort Knox
But you found my back door
Now you don't even have to knock
Sometimes I'm right (sometimes I'm right)
Sometimes I'm wrong (sometimes I'm wrong)
But I can't stay mad very long, oh my baby
You got that way with me
And when you smile, let's smile
We'll just agree to disagree
Ba da ba ba ba ba da ba
Ba da ba da da da da
Ba da ba ba ba ba da ba
Ba da ba da da da da
Ba da da da da da da da
Ba da ba ba ba
Ba da da da da da da da
Ba da ba ba ba ba
Sometimes I'm up (sometimes I'm up)
Sometimes I'm down (sometimes I'm down)
But you can always turn me around, my sweet baby
You got that way with me
You're the cream of my coffee, the orange zinger in my tea
I'll be your one stop mama when you need some TLC
I'll be your one stop mama when you need some TLC
