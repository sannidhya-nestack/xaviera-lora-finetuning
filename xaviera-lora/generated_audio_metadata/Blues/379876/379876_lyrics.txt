Everyone I know is a millionaire
Me myself I'm a gajillionaire
But the people on the street treat it so unfair
Ain't got much money, ain't the milk and the honey
With the books cooked funny and the nose all runny
Gotta slap the tummy of the Buddha
Woulda coulda shoulda gone down to Louis Town
Gotta get back to Louis Town
Gotta get my feet down to the ground
Gotta find the goodness all around
Or I'm just a blue Louis
You ain't gotta get back to Louis Town
Gotta get my feet down to the ground
Gotta find the goodness all around
For I'm just a L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L
Blue Louis
I feel just a little blue Louis
