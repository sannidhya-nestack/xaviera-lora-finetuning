In the cool of the evening when the light grows dim
The thought of Magnolia make my poor head swim
It's like honey to my beat when I hear her talk
I get weak in the knee when I see her walk
Magnolia
Honeysuckle vine
Magnolia
Always on my mind
Magnolia
I'll be yours if you'll be mine
You can talk about the weather
I got nothing to say
I'm dreamin' Magnolia every day
But I don't care if it rain or shine
I got Magnolia on my mind
Magnolia, honeysuckle vine
Magnolia
Always on my mind
Magnolia, I'll be yours if you'll be mine
Yeah, you can talk about the weather
I got nothing to say
I'm dreaming Magnolia every day
I don't care if it rain or shine
I got Magnolia on my mind
Magnolia
Honeysuckle vine
Magnolia
Always on my mind
Magnolia
I'll be yours if you be mine
Magnolia
Honeysuckle vine
Magnolia
Always on my mind
Magnolia, I'll be yours if you be mine (be mine)
I'll be yours if you be mine (be mine)
I'll be yours if you be mine (be mine)
I'll be yours if you be mine (be mind)
I'll be yours if you be mine (be my)
I'll be yours if you be mine (be mine)
I'll be yours if you be mine (be mine)
I'll be yours if you be mine (be mine)
I'll be yours
