It was daylight when I walked in here
And ordered up the first of my lost count beers
Now it's getting way past midnight and half the bar is closing down
My baby left me
And she took my chick
Then she had the nerve to call me
And she called Colette
She ain't grieving that she's leaving me
Or this one horse town
Yeah, so pour me another one
Just like the other one on my tab
Like you have missed her from the start
Yeah, pour me another one
Just like the other one on my half-crazed fool
With a full beer and an empty heart
I got laid off about a week ago
Same old story now, don't you know?
It seems the jobs are packing up and they're all heading south
I look for work, yeah but not too hard
I had something else to do and then I washed my car
I suppose that's why she said goodbye to me
But I have my doubts
Yeah, so pour me another one
Just like the other one on my tab
Like you have a mister from the start
Yeah, pour me another one
Just like the other one on my half
Graceful with a full beer and an empty heart
Was that last call hangin' all? I must admit I've had a ball
So let's come back and do it again tomorrow
But until then my old friend please fill up my glass again
And let me finish drownin' out my sorrow
Yeah, so pour me another one
Just like the other one
I'm a tap like you have, mister, from the start
Yeah, pour me another one
Just like the other one
I'm a half
Crazed fool with a full beer, yeah
So pour me another one
Just like the other one on my tab
Like you have a mister from the start
Yeah, pour me another one
Just like the other one on my half
Crazed fool with a full beer and it ain't be high
A full beer and an empty heart
A full beer and an empty heart
I'm a half-crazed fool with a full beer and an empty heart
