She said she's not in love
I guess she ought to know
And if I ever get her back into my arms
I'll never let my baby go
My heart's been broken too
I think my mind's been blown
And if I ever get back into my own
I'll never let my baby go
I thought I knew what I was doing
He thought, he thought, he thought he knew
When I walked outside her door
He walked, he walked outside her door
I thought that I'd be two times, two in
Two times, two times, two times
Instead she's giving me what for
I can't believe my eyes
I guess I'm all alone
And if I ever get a baby to my own
I'll never let that lady go, oh no
[Pause]
Guess I thought I knew what I was doin' (He thought he thought he thought he knew) (Yes, I did)
When I walked outside her door (He walked, he walked outside her door)
I guess that I was a two times two in love (Two times, two times, two times, two times)
And that's just gone forevermore
She said she's not in love
I ain't in love
I guess she all alone
And if I ever get her back into my arms
I'll never let my baby go
I'll never let that lady go
Oh don't let her go
Ain't gonna let her go
