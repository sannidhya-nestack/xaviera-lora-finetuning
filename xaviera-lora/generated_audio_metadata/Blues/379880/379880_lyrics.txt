They're the ones who bring us jobs, give us work to do
When it comes to knowing what they want they never do
Let's hear it for the clients (they're always playing)
Let's hear it for the clients (they're always playing)
Whoa, the clients can't be wrong
they're paying us to play this song
When you call them on the phone you just get their machine
You can email them at home but man that's kinda mean
Let's hear it for the client (you're always right)
Let's hear it for the client (you're always right)
Whoa, the client can't be wrong
he's paying us to play this song
They say you got to hurry, you can't hesitate
If they show it all they gonna be late
Let's hear it for the clients (they're always right)
Let's hear it for the clients (they're always right)
No, the client can't be wrong
he's paying us to play this song
If you think your client's wrong
You better change your mind
if you ever wanna get paid
You're gonna need that contract signed
He beat you up on your prices
Gets the best deal in town
When it comes to rides, it's just a caddy
Never around
Let's hear it for the client (it's always right)
Let's hear it for the client (it's always right)
Oh, the client can't be wrong
he paying us to play this song
Oh, the client can't be wrong
he paying us to play this
Paying us today
Paying us to play this song
Oh yeah
Hey guys, the record company just called. It has to be ten seconds long
