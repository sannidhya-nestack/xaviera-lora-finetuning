I know I'm not the man of your dreams
But that don't mean you can't use a friend
Can't have what I've got as it fits in your schemes
Only you can lean to the bitter end
Love would be nice, but it can change with the weather
A piece of advice, a good friend is forever
That's what you want, then that's what I'll be
And I'll be there as long as you're there for me
I'll be whatever you want me to be
I'll be whatever you want me to be
I promise not to come apart at the seam as I read the feelings in your eyes
I know I'm not the man of your dreams but let me repeat this word to the wise
Love would be nice, but it can change with the weather
A piece of advice, a good friend is forever
If that's what you want, then that's what I'll be
And I'll be there as long as you're there for me
I'll be whatever you want me to be
I'll be whatever you want me to be
Love would be nice, but it can change with the weather
A piece of advice, a good friend is forever, that's what you need
That's what I'll be and I'll be there as long as you're there for me
I'll be whatever you want me to be
I'm gonna be what you want me to be
I'll be whatever you want me to be
Girl, count on me
Whatever you want me to be
I'll be whatever you want me to be
I wanna be
I'll be whatever you want me to be
The love within
I'll be whatever you want me to be
As you wish.
