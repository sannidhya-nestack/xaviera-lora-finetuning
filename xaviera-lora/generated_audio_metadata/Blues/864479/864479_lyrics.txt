She's found the keys to my heart
Soon she'll be driving my truck
And when she dials my number I will pick it up
No sense in playing cool
Acting hard to get
You know I wear her like a tattoo
I just ain't bought it yet
And there's a reason
I'm smiling, oh there's a reason
She was my best night ever
Hit like a hurricane
She was my best kiss ever
Yeah, I'll explain
I saw stars
Felt the quakes
You know I heard the angels singing to the music we made
She was my best night ever
I didn't date
My mom and papa told me every single man has his day
You might not see love coming but love's coming for you just the same
Don't bother messing with little girls that can't own your heart
Life's too short son use your head be smart
And when love happens I'll let it blow you away
And I did my ma
She was my best night ever
Hit like a hurricane
She was my best kiss ever
Yeah, I'll explain
I saw stars
I felt the quakes
You know I heard the angels singing to the music we made
She was my best night ever to date
She was my best night ever to date
