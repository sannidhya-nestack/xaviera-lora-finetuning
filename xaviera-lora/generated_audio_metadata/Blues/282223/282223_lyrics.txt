Drinkin' that hard liquor for many a year
there's no past, no future, the end can't seem near
In this no man's land, whiskey's got me, my dear
Sittin' here drinkin'til we all disappear
And that hard liquor sure is hard on me
Oh yes it is baby
And that hard liquor sure is hard on me
Hard, hard liquor will get a hold of you
Feel like you died in the morning
You'll still et your sin
And it won't be long until you're at it again
Maybe vodka this time, or honey, whiskey or gin
And that hard liquor sure is hard on me
I'm gonna tell you the truth
And that hard liquor sure is hard on me
Does the devil make me do it? I do not know
Am I just playing crazy? Lots of people think so
I know I should give up this stuff
Because I never did learn when enough was enough and that hard
And that hot liquor sure is hard on me
Gonna tell you again
And that hot liquor sure is hard on me
Sure enough it is, honey, let me tell you, tell you
And that hot liquor sure is hard on me
Gonna tell you one more time and that hard liquor shot is hard on me
