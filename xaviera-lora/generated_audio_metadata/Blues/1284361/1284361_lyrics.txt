Woke up this morning, rain tapping on the roof
Sky's all grey, ain't got no solid proof
Trouble's been creeping knocking on my door
Heart feels heavy but I've been here before
Oh wind keep howling, storm is on the rise
Lost in this weather looking for clear skies
Guitar in my hands trying to find that sound
Need some kind of magic to turn it around
Walking down this road, ain't got no end in sight
Every shadow whispers secrets of the night
But there's fire in my soul, burning like the sun
Keep on moving forward, don't know where to run
Low in the heat, howling storm is on the rise
Lost in this weather, looking for blue skies
Guitar in my hand, try to find that sound
Need some kind of magic to turn it around
Hell, the road is rough and the night is cold
Keep on pushing with the stories we told
Stars are high and the moon is shy
Digging deep down, gonna learn to fly
I'm the little light breaking through the shade
Hopes that never glow and never let it fade
Feel that rhythm, it's steady and true
Gonna build my strength and see this
Journey through a windy howling storm is on the rise
Lost in this weather looking for grey skies
Guitar in my hands trying to find that sound
Need some kind of magic to turn it around
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, I'm searching for that light
Deep inside these tunes
Know I found my way beneath these faded moves
Song in my heart keep it rolling on
Hope for melody and I'll sing it strong
Yeah, I'm searching for the light deep inside these tunes
Know I'll find my way beneath these fading moons
Song in my heart keep it rolling on
Hope's a melody and I'll sing it strong
Oh, yeah
