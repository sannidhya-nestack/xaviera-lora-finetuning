Me and my baby
Kept right on fightin'
Twenty-four hours
Seven days a week
Me and my baby
There was nothing
On which we could agree
And I was
Hurting on the inside
Breaking up on the outside
Coming undone in the hot Texas sun
One hot afternoon I just left the house
I was walking away from everything I've been living for
Thirteen years felt like more
Walking away from my hopes and dreams
Walking away from my man, my everything
I was just walking away
People on the streets saw the shape I was in
They said, "Lady, can we help you?"
And I said, "No! Oh no !"
Because pain is my company
Misery sits down next to me
These tears I cry my only friends will be
Oh and I'm coming undone
Coming undone in the hot Texas sun
I was just coming undone
Coming undone in the hot Texas sun
I stopped at the wishing well
I threw a penny in and I prayed like hell
Can't we turn back the hands of time
Fall in love again make it good like it was back then
Cause pain is my company
Misery sits down next to me
These tears I cry, tears I cry
My only friends will be in I'm coming undone
Coming undone in the hot Texas sun
Wow, the hot Texas sun
Pain is my company
Misery sits down next to me
These tears I cry, tears I cry
My only friends will be in I'm coming undone
Coming undone
In the hot Texas sun
Hot Texas sun
I was just coming undone
Coming undone, oh
Oh, in the hot Texas sun
