I grew up in a town so small
You could pass it by and never know
It was on the outskirts of nowhere
There wasn't a lot of places to go
But every night when the sun goes down
Those honky-tonks would overflow
But those days are gone
There were a dozen local ballerin' hoes
And I sang and played in every one
I got to know each one's clientele
There was so much fun
Now it's a different city every night
I'm always on the run
I got the twelve bar blues and it's like an old refrain
I can still recall the faces and almost every name
That same old, same old Hattie's charm
But today it's overkill
I got the 12-bar blues and I guess I always will
Well, my work keeps me moving
And it's the endless one I stand
I live up north in a big RV
But my home is where I am
And though I'm where I wanted to be
It's just not quite what I planned
I got the twelve-bar blues
And it's like an old refrain
I can still recall the faces and almost every name
Time is a one way street don't you know
And this world just won't stand still
I got the twelve bar blues and I guess I always will
I got my work and keepin' me movin'
And it's an endless one-night stand
I live up north in a big RV
But my home is where I am
And though I'm where I wanted to be
It's not quite what I planned
I got the 12-bar blues and it's like an old refrain
I can still recall the faces
And almost every name
And time is a one way street
Don't you know this world just won't stand still
I got the twelve bar blues and I guess I always will
I got the twelve bar blues and I guess I always will
