Lord I'm heading west with a truck load of blues
I said I'm heading west with a truck load of blues
I'm hoping that this is a new start
Don't bring me back to you
Lord bring me back to you baby
I got me a job
Cleaning dishes at the cafe
Is on Main Street
Down to one oh nine
Said I got myself a job
Cleaning dishes at the cafe
I'm making seven dollars every hour I stay
One of these days mama
Lord I'm gonna have enough
To make you come and make you stay
For eternity baby
Said I lost the job
And I lost the apartment too
Said I lost the job
And I lost the apartment too
One of these days now mama
You gonna find
We're living in California too
