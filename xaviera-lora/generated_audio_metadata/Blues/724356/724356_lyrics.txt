Walking along the road or a dry river bed
Where there's a rocky soil stones will be widespread
They'll get into your shoes and then you've got to stop
Shake your shoes upside down and out they drop
One may have a sparkle that catches your eye
Just to pick it up and hold it to the sky
Polish an ordinary pebble, still a pebble
Polish a diamond in the rough and it's something special
Something special
So many stones on the ground
It's hard to find one
Out of the ordinary
One becomes a swan
Polish an ordinary pebble
Still a pebble
And polish a diamond in the rough
And it's something special
Something special
It's a word of comfort, a song of laughter, a voice of delight
It's a touch of kindness, a step of courage, a moment of joy
Polish an ordinary pebble, it's still a pebble
Polish a diamond in the rough and it's something special
Something special
May have a sparkle
In your heart you'll know
To carry it along with you wherever you may go
Polish an ordinary pebble
Still a pebble
Polish a diamond in the rough and it's something special
Polish an ordinary pebble, it's still a pebble
Polish a diamond in the rough and it's something special
Something special
