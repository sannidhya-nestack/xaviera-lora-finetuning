You left me alone
In deep misery
But I know you'll come back home
And give me release
I count the days until you return
To see you again
I know you'll be mine somewhere down the line
Somewhere down the line
Where did it go wrong?
I just can't believe
I feel like I don't belong
I'm begging you please come back and stay
It's never too late to hold me again
I know you'll be mine somewhere down the line
Somewhere down the line
Save me now
Take away this hurt inside
Somewhere, somehow
If you give it time
We'll make it right
I'm looking for laughter
I've paid my dues
And here ever after
The sun will shine through
Make no mistake
I just can't wait
To hold you again
And again
I know you'll be mine
Somewhere down the line
Somewhere down the line
It's gonna be fine
Somewhere down the line
Somewhere down the line
One day you'll be mine
Somewhere down the line
Somewhere down the line
Somewhere down the line
