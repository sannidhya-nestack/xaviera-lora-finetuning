I went down to St. James Infirmary to see my baby there
He was lying on a long white table so sweet, so cool, so fair
I went up to see the doctor
He's very low, he said
Went back to see my baby
Good God, he's lying there dead
Went down to old Joe's bar room
On the corner by the square
They were serving the drinks as usual
And the usual crowd was there
On my left stood old Joe McKennedy
And his eyes were bloodshot red
He turned to the crowd around him
And these are the words he said
Let him go, let him go, God bless him
Wherever he may be
You can search the wide world over
And never find a better man than he
Oh when I die please bury me
In my ten dollar searchin' hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my necklace
So my friends don't know I died standing pat
Get six gamblers to carry my coffin
Six chorus girls to sing me a song
Put a smokin' hot blues band on my tailgate
To raise hell as I we go along
Now that's the end of my story
Let's have another round of booze
And if anybody should ask you, you just tell them
I got those St. James infirmary blues
