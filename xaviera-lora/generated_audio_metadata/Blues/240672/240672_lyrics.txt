I could write the sweetest song
I could build a bridge so long
But there's nothing I can do about you
I can make a diamond stone
I could break the devil's bones
But there's nothing I can do about you
When I need a little action
You got things to do
My love's a blazing fire, baby
I met my match in you
You stand before me
You lead me on
First you kiss me
And then you're gone
But there's nothing I can do about you
But honey you hold the reins
You're on my mind
You're on my bed
My only truth is what you said
And there's nothing I can do about you
