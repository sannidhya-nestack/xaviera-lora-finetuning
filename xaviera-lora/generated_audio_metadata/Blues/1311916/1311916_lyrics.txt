Oh, people really annoy me, they get out of my skin
I'd rather talk to a tree, depending on the mood I'm in
Think I've been missing since the day I was born
There's been many times I wanna quit, I feel so, so much gone
Yeah
It took me half of that time
To figure out who I am
It's such a dark, cold crime
I could've been a different man
I fell into a bottle of booze
I couldn't find my way out
That's why I'm singing the blues
And I just wanna shout a good spread or two
Outside them nowhere men's blues
My feelings were bottled up inside
I didn't trust what I knew
It was a nice place to hide
From them no-hands man's blues
I was a man with no face
A stranger in the crowd
It was a damn disgrace
I gotta hear how loud
I got them no-hands man's blues
It took me half a lifetime
To figure out who I am
It's such a dark old crime
I could've been a different man
I fell into a bottle of booze
I couldn't find my way out
That's why I'm singing the blues
And I just wanna shout at the nowhere man's blues
I found my way out
I'm done with the nowhere man's blues
