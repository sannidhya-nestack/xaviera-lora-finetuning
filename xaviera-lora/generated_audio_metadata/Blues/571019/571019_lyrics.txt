It's been a long time, and I know it's getting late
But there's still time to make some more mistakes
I'm ready and willing
To start again
But lately I'm getting old
it seems like that pot of gold
Won't be at the end of the rainbow anymore
I ain't running out of money
I ain't running out of steam
But lately I've been running out of dreams
Oh lately I'm getting old
Cause it feels like that pot of gold
Won't be at the end of the rainbow anymore
I ain't running out of money
I ain't running out of steam
But lately
I've been running out of dreams
I ain't running out of money
I ain't running out of steam
Oh, but lately I've been running out of dreams
