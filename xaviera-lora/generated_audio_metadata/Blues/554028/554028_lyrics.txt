I wake up in the morning and no one's there
Feels kinda empty but I don't care
I walk around wonder what's wrong
Been through this many times
First they're here
Then they're gone
And I know I'm gonna be alright
Once again
She may come back or maybe not
And I don't care
I never knew what was up
With her blank stare
Come on baby come back home
You're crazy and I know it
But crazy's the only thing I know
I wake up in the morning, coffee in my hand
Seven days till Monday, there's more than I can stand
Never knew where you went, one day you were gone
It doesn't matter anyway
crazy women come
Crazy women go
And I know I'm gonna make it to the sunrise
Once again
Woke up in the morning
Oh, yes, I woke up in the morning
All alone, all alone
Yes, I'm alone
Woke up in the morning
Nobody's there, nobody's home
All alone
All alone
