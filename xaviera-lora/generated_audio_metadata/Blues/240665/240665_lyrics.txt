I got a house downtown
It's a run down shack, baby, best be torn down
I got a house downtown
It's a two-tone double white, a dirty shade of brown
I got a house, but don't you see
Any place with you is like a paradise for me
I got a car in my drive
It's a broke down Ford, baby, it's barely alive
I got a car in my drive
My grandma, she left me it back in 1975
I got a car, but don't you see
Any ride with you is like a Cadillac for me
Better, baby makes everything better
Change the snow to tropical weather
Don't you see everything you do makes it better for me
I got a dress that I like to wear
It's long, out of style, baby, it's real Fredbear
I got a dress that I like to wear
It's got the hem hanging down here but I don't care
I got a dress but don't you see
When I'm standing next to you, I'm like the Queen of Araby
Better, baby makes everything better
Change the snow to tropical weather
Don't you see, everything you do makes it better for me
I got a heart here in my chest
It's a silly little thing but it tries its best
I got a heart here in my chest
Yeah, it's nicked and bruised on its lover's quest
But this heart, it beats strong
When I'm lying next to you, baby, all night long
Better, baby makes everything better
Changes snow to tropical weather
Don't you see
Everything you do makes it better for me
Better
Baby makes everything better
Change the snow to tropical weather
Don't you see
Everything you do makes it better for me
Everything you do
Everything you do
Everything you do makes it better for me
