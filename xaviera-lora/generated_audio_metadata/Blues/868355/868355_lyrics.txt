You got that shine on
Shining on like a crazy diamond baby
You're pretty as a pearl
Whoa oh oh
That dress you're trying on
Look even better on you than the picture do
With that model in the photo
I'm rolling out the red carpet for you
Picking out the stars in the sky for you
Leaving a man in the moon's got a wing and his eye for you
She got shine, shine, shine, shine
Stargazing on the rooftop, pop champagne and a couple dixie cups
I got another bottle if it ain't enough
So raise'em up, raise'em up tonight
Papa don't want you home late
But the clock on the desk says 2-0-8 and I ain't gonna lie
I couldn't leave you if I tried
So tell'em you can leave a light on for ya
But don't wait up late'cause these arms of mine are working overtime
Loving you on my mind
I don't mean'em no disrespect
Something divine in the way we connect
Maybe the guy in the sky got a plan for you and I
'Cause we got shine, shine, shine, shine
Stargazing on the rooftop, pop champagne and a couple Dixie cups
I got another bottle if it ain't enough so raise'em up, raise'em up tonight
She was bright like a neon sign
She could light that G ia sky
She got cancellations in her eyes
She got shine
Oh she got shine
Oh she got shine
Shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine
Doggays look from the rooftop, pop champagne and a couple Dixie cups
I got another bottle if it ain't enough to raise'em up, raise'em up tonight
Shine, got shine, she got shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine
She got shine
