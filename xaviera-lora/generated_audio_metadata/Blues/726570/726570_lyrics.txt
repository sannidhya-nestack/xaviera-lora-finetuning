You're a player that can't be denied
The long line of women you've loved and abandoned
You can't hide, take what you want
When it's not enough, you cast them aside
You pass my office every day
You're always smiling, winking and flirting when I look your way
If I give in to you, Lord only knows the hell that I'll pay
I won't be that woman (won't be that woman)
Lyin' in your arms
Won't be the next victim
To fall to your charms (fall to your charms)
I won't be that woman, one you can use
My self respect is something I just ain't willing to lose
You're standing with flowers
Outside my door (my door)
You act like no is a word you've never heard before
The desire I feel for you is getting hard to ignore
I won't be that woman lying in your arms
Won't be the next victim to fall to your charms
I won't be that woman (won't be that woman)
One you can use
My self respect is something
I just ain't willing to lose
Lose
I've tried, I've tried so many times
To get you to leave me alone, leave me alone
I know my limits
And temptation is getting way too strong
You need to move on
I won't be that woman
