Trouble in my mind
Feline trouble
She was small and stray
Trouble knocked on my back door that day
Played with that feline, called her trouble
She looked at me that way
Then I let that trouble through my back door that day
She ate and drank all day long like an aborigine
I stood there just wondering why this trouble came to me
Then she scratched and bit me all night through
Till my heart was beating slow
I ain't never had trouble like this man in my life before
In the morning, that mean feline, she wanted out to play
So I gladly let that trouble out my back door that day
Oh, she was mean, I missed that feeling
So I got down on my knees to pray
Dear Lord, let trouble come back to me someday
The Lord said, "Son, I know you're blue
But you won't be blue always"
And some trouble gonna come, son, through your back door
Some trouble gonna walk, son, through your back door
Some trouble gonna come through your back door, son, someday
