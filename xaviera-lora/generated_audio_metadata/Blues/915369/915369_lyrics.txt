I can't begin to count
How many times you let me down with your lying
How many tears I've cried
On the long and lonely nights
I felt like dying
You don't know how hard this is
Hearing you begging for iveness
Telling me how much it hurts to be apart
Get up off your knees
I've heard all I need
It's enough to break my broken heart
Baby I ive you
But then that's nothing new
You're sorry, well I am too
Sorry for what you put me through
And I will never, never, no I will never take you back
That's the last thing on earth I'd ever do
But baby I ive you
You want me to et all the unhappiness
But there's no way, it's a part of me
Like a bad memory
That time can't erase
There's nothing left to try
You're down to no more, one more time
The good thing you had going is moving on
But before I go
I want you to know
I won't hold it against you when I'm gone
But baby I ive you
But then that's nothing new
You're sorry, well I am too
I'm sorry for what you put me through
And I will never, never, no I will never take you back
That's the last thing on earth I'll ever do
But baby I ive you
Oh no I'll never, never, never take you back
That's the last thing on earth I'll ever do
But baby I ive you
