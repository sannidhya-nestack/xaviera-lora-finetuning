If you ain't got the love, boy, don't come around no more
I don't need your diamond rings like you gave me before
You can take back all your photographs of me kissing you
when I see what you done to me, boy, I get the feeling blue
If you lost all your passion, boy, stay away from my house
It's not the words you used to say, but the way that you pronounce
You lost that silver tongue of yours and that silver lightning too
when I see what you done to me, boy, it's a feeling blue
Now get, leave my life, put your key back under the mat
Your clothes are in the trash can with all the other cheatin' rats
If you ain't got no commitment, boy, you better leave my heart
Been tellin' all those girls in town I'm no good, no way, no how
I believe you gave me the right to end it all with you
Cause when I see what you done to me boy I get the feeling blue
'Cause when I see what you done to me I feel so blue
When I see what you done to me I feel so blue, so blue, so blue, so blue
Get the feeling, get the feeling blue
Get a feelin' blue
