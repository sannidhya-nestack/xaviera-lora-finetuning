I'm feeling lazy, I'm feeling bad
I'm feeling crazy, I'm feeling sad
I'm feeling low lordy, I'm feeling blue
I'm feeling down, mama, how's about you?
Everyone's driving me crazy, everything's making me mad
Life sucks, ah, don't it though, yeah
Feeling twisted, feeling turned
Feel I've missed it, feeling burned
Feeling lonely, feeling blue
Feeling empty, Lordy, how'bout you?
Everyone's driving me crazy
Everything's making me mad
Life sucks, oh don't it though yeah
Well you say you find it so hard to believe my life's been this bad
But you'd be singing the blues too if you'd been living life the way that I have
Oh yeah
Well you say you find it so hard to believe my life's been this bad
But you'd be singing the blues too if you'd been living life way ahead
I'm feeling wired, feeling worn
I'm feeling tired, feeling torn
Feeling taken, feeling blue
Feeling naked, mama, how'bout you?
Everyone's driving me crazy
Everything's making me mad
Life sucks
Oh, don't it, don't it
Because everyone's driving me crazy
Everything's making me mad
Life sucks
Oh, don't it though, yeah
