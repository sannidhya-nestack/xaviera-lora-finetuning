Oh Lord, I love the blues
It's in my blood
Oh Lord, I love the blues
It's the blues I love
Now James is in the alley
Kicking off his blues
In the street is Aunt Sally
Double to Tommy
Shuffling her shoes
A marching band swinging dicks there
A church choir singing hi
Out on the Mississippi
A steamboat chugs by
Oh Lord I love the blues
It's in my blood
Oh Lord I love the blues
It's the blues I love
Oh Lord I love the blues
It's in my blood
Oh Lord I love the blues
It's the blues I love
Down here in New Orleans
Music's in the air
In the bar at Fat Pony's
The stiff drinkers are letting down their hair
There's dancing out on the street
And in every living place
Everyone you see and meet
Ain't got a smile on their face
Oh Lord I love the blues
It's in my blood
Oh Lord I love the blues, it's the blues I love
Then came the dark thunder, washed away the blues
So much went down, down on earth, but we'll build it up new
I love the blues, it's in my blood
Oh Lord, I love the blues
I love the blues, it's in my blood
Oh Lord, I love the blues
Then came the dark thunder and washed away the blues
So much went down, down under
But we'll build it up new
Oh lord I love the blues
It's in my blood
Oh lord I love the blues
It's the blues I love
Mmm, Lord, I love the blues, check it out, ah, the blues
Mmm, I love the blues, I love the blues, I love the blues
I love the blues, New Orleans blues, I love the blues
James is in the alley, kicking off his blues
In the street is Aunt Sally
Double-D dumb and shuffling her shoes
A marching band swinging dixie
Lord, the church choir singing high
Out on the Mississippi
Steamo Chugs back
Oh Lord I love the blues
It's the blues I love
Oh Lord I love the blues
It's in my blood
My Lord I love the blues
It's the blues I love
No, no, I love the blues in my blood
