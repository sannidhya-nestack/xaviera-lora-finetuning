You never can say goodbye
No matter how much you try
You never can say goodbye
No matter how much you try
And you hold her in your arms
Then you look into her eyes
And you succumb to her charms
Then surprise, surprise
You never can say goodbye
No matter how much you try
You never can say goodbye
No matter how much you try
She takes you by the hand
And she gives a little love
Now I'm just a man
I can never get enough
You know I can't say goodbye
No matter how much you try
You know I can't say goodbye
No matter how much you try
I fell in your honey
Like a fly I can't get free
I'm trapped by your sweet touch
I can never get enough
You know I can't say goodbye
No matter how much you try
You know I can't say goodbye
No matter how much you try
You know I can't say goodbye
No matter how much you try (I try, I try)
You never can say goodbye (no, no, no)
No matter how much you try
