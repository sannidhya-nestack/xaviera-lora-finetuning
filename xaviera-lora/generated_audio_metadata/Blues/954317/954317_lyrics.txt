I woke up in the morning
Though I've been awake all night
I'm searching for a reason
To keep myself alive
That's what I do
My head's in a swirl
Yeah
I'm sitting here
Feeling on top of the world
My woman's gonna left me, she left me high and dry
Without no explanation
And I keep asking why I've been a fool
To fall for that girl, yeah
I'm sitting here
Feeling on top of the world
I'm sitting here
Feeling on top of the world
I'm sitting here
I'm feeling on top of the world
