Ain't got my baby, so I ain't got no heart
Ain't got my baby
No I ain't got no heart
I'm drowning in a sea of pain
My world is falling apart
Ain't got my baby
So I can't go nowhere
Ain't got my baby, no, no, no
So I can't go nowhere
When the one you love don't love you
It's such a cross to bear
I miss my baby
She had that twinkle in her eyes
I miss my baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
She had that twinkle in her eyes
Possessed with all her beauty
I couldn't move, I was hypnotized
Or should I just let her be
