You don't know me, I don't know you
But yet here we are
Sharing this moment, this empty moment
In the front seat of your car
For all you know I may be dead
And six feet in the ground
But you can hear me, you can hear me
Every ear is sound
So what can I tell you to make you remember
Don't let me be your guide
There's no magic information
That could change you deep inside
I don't know you
You don't know me
So please don't be misled
I can't hear you
But you hear me
And now I'm in your head
I'm in your head now
I'm in your head now
There's nothing you can do
I'm in your head now
I'm in your head now
And there's nothing you can do
I'm in your head now
I'm in your head now
And there's nothing you can do
I'm in your head now
I'm in your head now
I bet you didn't know
What you were getting yourself into
When you put my CD in your CD player
Well now you're stuck with me
And now you gotta see
You gotta see it through
There's nothing else to do
