Every morning I greet the mirror
Say how the hell are ya
Doing so
Sometimes a man smiles
And other times he sighs
And answers me in the voice of a child
He says I declare that this life ain't real
That we are the reflections of what we choose to feel
I was uncertain if his words were true
So I bought myself a drink and wrote this song for you
And no one ever told me how lonesome freedom can be
I broke out of the prison just to be chained to the breeze
I'm getting thin, growing old, roaming freedom road
I met my best friend when living in hell
And I learned of heartache drinking from heaven's wells
And a saint once told me that I was holy
Then she handed me a serpent
And a gun
I loaded the revolver
Then shot the snake
Turned its skin into a noose
I walked to the lake
But the saint said, "What the hell do you think you're doing?"
Said, "I don't rightly know, but it seemed easier than praying"
And no one ever told me how long some freedom can be
I broke out of it
Of the prison just to be chained to the breeze
I'm getting thin, growing old
Roaming Freedom Road
Roaming Freedom Road
The devil he come along cut me loose
Fed to his hell hound my rattlesnake news
Then he spoke to me soft and sweet
He said young man I can help you back on your feet
There I stood before devil and a saint
Both offering to me the keys to their gates
Well I shot off
Three silver round
One for the good
One for the bad
And one to lay me down
And no one ever told me how long some freedom can be
I broke out of the prison just to be chained to the breeze
I'm getting thin, going home
Roaming Freedom Road
Roaming Freedom Road
Roaming Freedom Road
Roman freedom roll
Every morning I greet the mirror
See how the hell are you doing, sir?
