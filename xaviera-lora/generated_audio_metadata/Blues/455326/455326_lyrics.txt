Hot shots, hot on your heels
On a hot street closing, hot deals
He's climbing, but you're not
He's stealing first while you're giving it all you got
Shot down by the heart of gold
They're getting younger but you, you're getting nothing but old
Try not to fight it, but try to ride it
Don't get excited
You must get through it, and you can do it
Just like you knew it, oh, so why do you know?
Back to the start and around we go
Well it's a funny old world so just look around
Winners and losers, smiles and frowns
When your goal is accept, but you settle for reject
And you're seeking life's ocean with a weight'round your neck
So tell me buddy, what have you learned?
Not a lot, took a shot and got burned (oh oh oh oh)
Try not to fight it, but try to ride it
Don't get excited (oh oh oh oh)
You must get through it, you can do it
Just like you knew it, oh so what do you know?
Back to the start and around we go
