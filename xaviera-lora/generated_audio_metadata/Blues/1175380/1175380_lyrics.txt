Little me, staring through the windows of my eyes
Little me, know the truth but still living a lie
Don't you hear me callin', don't you see me fallin'
Why don't you catch me, I can't breathe
Don't you hear me callin', don't you see me fallin'
Why don't you catch me, I can't breathe
Lil U
Keep making the same old, same mistakes (same old, same mistakes)
Same old, same old, same mistakes, same old
Little you just need for the man to give you a break (break, break, break, break, break)
Oh, oh, oh (break, break, break, break, break)
Little people
There are small minds
Small hearts
Lazy times
We are all
Giant people
Big lives
Big arms
Big dreams
Big love
Don't you hear me calling
Don't you see me falling
Why don't you catch me
I can't breathe
Don't you hear me calling
Don't you see me falling
Why don't you catch me
I can't breathe
Don't you hear me callin'? Don't you see me fallin'? Why don't you catch me? I can't breathe
Don't you hear me callin'? Don't you see me fallin'? Why don't you catch me?
I can't breathe (I can't breathe)
No, don't you hear me calling?
Don't you see me falling? (Catch me girl)
Why don't you catch me? (Catch me)
I can't breathe (I can't breathe)
No, no, no
Don't you hear me calling?
Don't you see me falling?
Why don't you catch me? (Catch me)
I can't breathe (I can't breathe)
Don't you hear me callin'?
Don't you see me fallin'?
Why don't you just catch me?
I can't breathe (I can't breathe)
