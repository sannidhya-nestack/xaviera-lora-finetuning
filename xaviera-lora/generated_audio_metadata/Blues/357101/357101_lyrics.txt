You send me email in the morning
Send me email late at night
I know you got a man there
And you know I got a wife
You working on me
I know you working on me
I'm not sure what you got in mind
But I like you working on me
When you call me on the phone you say my voice you need to hear
I'm not sure what it is you're saying but it's pleasing to my ear
You're working on me (working on me)
I know you're working on me (working on me)
I'm not sure what you got in mind but I like you working on me
I know you're working on me (working on me)
I know you're working on me (working on me)
I know you're working on me (working on you)
I know you're working on me (working on)
I'm not sure what you've got in mind but I like you working on me
I see your green eyes staring at me with your long wavy hair
I'm not sure why I think about you
I'm not sure I even care
You're working on me
I know you're working on me
I'm not sure what you got in mind but I like you working on me
Now when I wake up in the morning and I've got you by my side
Now you know that I'm your man and I know that you're my wife
You're working on me (working on me)
I like you working on me (working on me)
I'm not sure what you've got in mind but I like you working on me
I know you working on me
Working on me
I know you working on me
Working on me
I know you working on me
Working on me
I know you working on me
Working on me
I'm not sure what you've got in mind
But I like you working on me
I like you working on me (working on me)
I like you working on me (working on me
I like you working on me (working on me
I like you working on me (working on me
I'm not sure what you've got in mind but I like you working on me
