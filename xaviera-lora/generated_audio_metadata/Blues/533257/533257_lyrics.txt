Gone to Memphis, baby, do you wanna go?
Gone to Memphis, baby, do you wanna go
Or take a time, drive down the slope
I just met you, you got my heart on fire
Yeah, I just met you, you got my heart on fire
You're so good looking, I'm burning up with desire
Well, stroll down Beale Street, visit the home of the king
Sleep at the Peacock, make good love and everything
Might go out and find you a diamond ring
There's blues in Memphis, soul power everywhere
There's blues in Memphis, magic's in the air
We'll do just fine grooving down there
So glad I found you, you're my buttercup
So glad I found you, you're my buttercup
The way you shake it got me standing up
I'm going to Memphis, baby, do you wanna go?
I'm going to Memphis, baby, do you wanna go?
We'll take our time, drive down
We'll take our time, drive down
We'll take our time, drive down real slow
