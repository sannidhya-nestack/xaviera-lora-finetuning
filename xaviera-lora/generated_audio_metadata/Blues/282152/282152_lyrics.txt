Help me, help me
Give me a little sympathy
That's what I heard him say
That's what I heard him say
He said
All due right baby
I've really changed this time
I didn't mean the mean things I said I was
Out of my mind, help me
Oh, I need, I need love and sympathy
I said, I don't know if I can
Oh baby, I'm afraid, afraid to try it
One more time, one more time
Will you leave me crying?
I told him, I said, I know who you were
I don't really know who you are
I'm always so nervous around you baby, I feel like
You're just a loaded gun
Russian roulette is getting old
I'm afraid you're gonna go off at any time
That's right, any time
He just looked at me with tears in his eyes
He got down on his knees, he said help me, help me, help me, help me
As the eagle flies, as the wind blows
As my heart beats in my chest, baby
I've lost my senses, I don't know
He just said, "Baby, I'll do better, baby
Help me" uh-huh
He said to me
Ooh, baby, I need sympathy and help me
Oh, help me
I might if you help yourself
