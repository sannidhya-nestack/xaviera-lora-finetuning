When I drive, I want to get home alive
When I roam, I want to make it home
But I worry about you
Phone in hand, I get the clue
I say put the phone down, put the phone down
Put the phone down, put the phone down
Put the phone down, put the phone down
Put the phone down, put the phone down
On the highway run, on the highway of doom
The damage is done
Someone texting the blues
And I worry about you
The phone in hand
Like it's glued
I say put the phone down, put the phone down
Put the phone down, put the phone down
Put the phone down, put the phone down
Put the phone down, put the phone down
It's a Friday night
You got the game on your mind
I say put that phone down
Oh put the phone down
You're running late
You get a call from your date
Oh, put the phone down
Mmm, put the phone down
In the blink of an eye
Oh, don't you know you could die
I say put that phone down
Oh, put the phone down
When I pray, I get down on my knees
And I say, "Lord, won't you please?"
I worry about you
Goin' in hand like it's glued
I say put the phone down, put the phone down
Put the phone down, put the phone down
Put the phone down, put the phone down
Put the phone down before you hurt somebody
