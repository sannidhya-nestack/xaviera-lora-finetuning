There's a bad storm coming in
And now you're knocking at my door
There's a bad storm coming in
And now you're knocking at my door
Well you can knock all you want
I don't know you anymore
When you up and walked away
The sun was shining big and bright
When you up and walked away
The sun was shining big and bright
Guess you never stopped to think
There'd come a dark and stormy night
Oh, yeah, yeah
You've got a soul like frozen sleet and a heart made out of ice
You've got a soul like frozen sleet and heart made out of ice
Now you're left out in the cold and I'm not even thinking twice
There's a bad storm comin' in and now you're knockin' at my door
Yeah, there's a bad storm comin' in and now you're knockin' at my door, yeah
Well, you can knock all you want but I don't know you anymore
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
