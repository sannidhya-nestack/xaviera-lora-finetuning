When this song is over, I'm gonna pack these tunes away
I've got no grounds for feeling down anymore
My lover's been away so long, now he's coming home to stay
I won't need these blues to while away the hours like before but
What can I do?
I'm gonna miss these old shoes
And the souvenirs of all these years alone
But holding on to you
And my melancholy solitude
Ain't good for me no more
Gonna rush you out the door now
Blues go away
I'm begging you blues go away
I know I'll miss my faithful friend but I'm gonna be okay
So blues go away
It's true this old refrain has worked for me so well
It's hard to walk away from this old hand
So one more time we'll sing these lines and let that music swell
Then you've gotta go when my baby shows'cause he won't understand that
So worn and well used I've gotten used to these blues
The same old line I'm doing fine on my own
A tearful goodbye to the friend I so depend upon
Then that's all, it's last call, it's time to go home
Blues, go away
I'm asking you nice blues, go away
I know I'm gonna miss you
But it's coming home to stay
Blues, blues go away
I know I'll miss my faithful friend
But I think I'll be okay, so
Blues go away
Soon I'll miss you sometimes, please go away, please go away
