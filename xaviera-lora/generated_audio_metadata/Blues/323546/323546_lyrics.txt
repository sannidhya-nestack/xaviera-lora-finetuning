I'm floating down the lazy river
On the decks of the Delta Queen
I'd love me a cup of coffee
And some of those fine Pauline's
I just wanna get on back down home now
To the streetlight street of my dreams
I just wanna get on back down home
On down at the New Orleans
Now let me wake up in the city that sits below the sea
And hear those southern breezes blowing through those magnolia trees
I just wanna get on back down home now
To the streamlined street of my dreams
I just wanna get on back down home
On down at the New Orleans
Those hot summer evenings
When music just fills the air
I just maybe head on down to the tip of Geno's
I hope those devil brothers are there
Now let me wake up in that Southern beauty
Head on down to Brennan's for some hot beignets
Maybe I'll grab me a morning paper to read with my cafe au lait
Lady I'll head on down to that quarter
Have me some crawfish and a hurricane
It sure is nice just being on back down here in New Orleans
Excuse me oldie, mind passing me over that bottle of baby over there? I sure would appreciate it. You know I would. Thank you baby.
