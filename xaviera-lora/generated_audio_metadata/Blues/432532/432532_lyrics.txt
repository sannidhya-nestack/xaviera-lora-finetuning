Calling Mr Johnson
Hear me calling out your name
I've walked side by side with the devil
To try and ease my pain
The hounds are out to get me
And pull me down again
Calling Mr. Johnson
Where did you get that feeling from?
He said, "Son, I don't know what it is
I know that's where you belong"
The wind, it keeps a howling
And it's calling out your name
When the boys crash from the crossroads
And you're down that road again
Take me down
Took a train back from Chicago
To the groove of a broken track
At the neck of a bottle
There ain't no looking back
And your spirit keeps them going
With the soul of a preacher man
And the wind will keep on howling
Steel slide, bar and guitar in hand
In your hands
Can you hear the wind howl
Can you hear the wind howl?
