Oh Ronnie, oh Ronnie
Oh play for me, oh Ronnie
Wrap me in the center of your song and let me
When I hear you strum, let me hear you strum
Let it ring and hum, oh let me hear that strum
With that trademark drive I arise
And let the moment come
Let me hear you play, oh let me hear you play
I won't look past today when I hear you play
Wrap forever in the here and now
I know that you know how
When I hear you play
I don't look past today
You make the moment stay
Won't you let me hear you play
So wrap me in the rhythm and the chords, my guitar lord
Oh Ronnie, won't you play for me
Oh Ronnie, won't you play for me
Caressing every fret on that worn out maple neck
Let the moment be
Pick up your guitar
Pick up your guitar
Let it take me far
You can drive my car
So wrap me in the center of your song
And let me linger long
Oh, Ronnie, go play for me
Oh, Ronnie, go play for me
Oh, Ronnie, go play for me
Oh Ronnie, won't you play for me?
Oh Ronnie, oh play for me
Oh Ronnie, won't you play for me
Oh Ronnie, oh play for me
