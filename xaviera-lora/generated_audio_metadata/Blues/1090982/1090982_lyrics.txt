I took you out and bought you new red shoes
Looked to me like you had the blues
Red shoe shovel, you're doing a red shoe shovel
Red shoe shovel gonna shovel away your blues
Quarantine tune, sweetheart, feeling fine
Ever since you bought the new shoes of mine
Red shoe shuffle, I'm doing the red shoe shuffle
Red shoe shuffle, gon' shuffle away your blues
Shuffle baby
Looked at her with her new shoes on
Telling her man she was gone, gone, gone
Red shoes shuffle
Throwing the red shoes shuffle
Red shoes shuffle gonna shuffle away your purse
Well she looked real fine in her three chills
Look at her face, you can see how she feels
Red shoe shuffle, doing the red shoe shuffle
Doing the red shoe shuffle, gonna shuffle up where your blues
Said baby, baby, you're so sweet
How'd you think I look with my new shoes on my feet
Doing the red shoe shuffle, red shoe shuffle
Put on the right shoes, shuffle on, shuffle up with your blues, yeah
