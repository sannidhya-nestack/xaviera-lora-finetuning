In my small blue boots under a big old tree
Singing my country blues as happy as can be
With a little straw hat under the burning sun
Having all the fun till my day is done
Oh country blues simple and sweet
Your rhythm makes me move my feet
Up and down to and fro with you everywhere I go
With my plushy toy guitar on this wooden porch
Playing my sweet tunes like a beautiful torch
Under the twinkling stars singing the night away
With my country blues I end my day
Oh country blues, gentle and kind
Your melody is always on my mind
Day and night rain or shine
With you I'm always fine
So here I am with my country blues
Singing out loud in my worn out shoe
It's a simple song for me and you
Oh my dear country blues, I love you too
With my country blues singing out loud in my worn out shoes
It's a simple song for me and you
Oh my dear country blues I love you too
