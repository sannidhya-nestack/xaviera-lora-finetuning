Try to find a woman who can give me love
Try to find a woman who can give me love
There ain't no fun in this world
You can't find a woman who can give me love
You can't find a woman who can give me love
There ain't no phone in this world
There ain't no woman who can give me love
There ain't no woman who can give me love
There ain't no fun in this world
There were times when I was searching a woman
There were times when I was searching a woman
There ain't no fun in this world
In every little town in this whole damn world
In every little country where I've been learned
No woman, there ain't no woman
There ain't no fun in this world
There ain't no woman who can give me love
There ain't no woman who can't give you love
There ain't no fun in this world
There ain't no fun in this world
There ain't no fun
In this whole damn world
