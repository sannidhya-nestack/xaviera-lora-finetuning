A hole in the nest
The babies fell out
Their mama's blown the coop
A hole in the nest
And it's sitting on the front porch
Just laying by the door
As a signal to all
That pass by this way
That it's been punctured
It been blown out
Not to spill the real
A hole in the nest
A hole in the nest
The babies fell out
Their mommas blown the coop
A hole in the nest
And it's sitting on the front porch
Just laying by the door
As a signal to all
That passed by this way
That it's been punctured
It been blown out
Not just filled with rail
A hole in the nest
A-holdin' the nest, but the babies fell out
Their mama's flown the coop, a-holdin' the nest
And all the front porch, and by the door
And the signal to all that pass by this way
That it's been punctured, it's been blown out
Not to smithereen
A hole in the nest
The babies fell out
Their mommas blown the coop
A hole in the nest
And it's sitting on the front porch
It's laying by the door
As a signal to all
That pass by this way
That it's been punctured
It's been blown out
Yeah it's been punctured
It's been blown out, not to smithereens
