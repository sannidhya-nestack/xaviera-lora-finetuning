Feels like a hurricane hummin'
Feels like the wind's gonna blow
I heard the thunder and the lightning
I even heard the rooster crow
You love me baby
You know you love me baby
Yes you love me baby
Why don't you come back home?
My little girl, she left me
Must have been a week or more
I feel so low now baby
As low down as the floor
I want you back baby
I want you back baby
Said I want you back baby
Don't ever leave me no more
Says she'll be back tomorrow
You know that makes me feel real good
when she gets back tomorrow
Things will be the way they should
I love you baby
You know you love me baby
Yes, I love you, baby
Won't you please come home
Come on, baby, come back now
(Dog barking)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
You make me sunshine, darling
You make me wanna scream and shout
Everybody in the neighborhood knows when we're about
I love you, baby
And you love me, baby
Yes, I love you baby, I'm so glad you're home
