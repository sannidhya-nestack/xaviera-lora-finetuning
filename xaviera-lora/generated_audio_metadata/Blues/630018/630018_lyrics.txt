I was so wrong, so sorry
For the pain I put you through
There's a thousand things, baby
I would like to say to you
Oh can't you see
I want iveness
Your iveness
Please ive me
I wish I could summon up
The courage
But the timing's never right
I'm a bad girl and ruler
That wants to run away and hide
Oh, I'm so weak
I need iveness
Your iveness
Please ive me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Won't you please ive me?
We had a plan, a vision
But all that's left is shattered glass, oh
And that picture frame darling
Should hold the good times from the past
Oh sweet memories
I want iveness
Your iveness
Please ive me
I'm down on my knees for you baby
