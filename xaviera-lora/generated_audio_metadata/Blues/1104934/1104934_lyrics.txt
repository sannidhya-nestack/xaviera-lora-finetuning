The lights went out on a grey Wednesday night
A raging storm brought a blanket of ice across the city
We prayed for the sun back in the winter of'51
Six foot of snow
Covered lights, fallen trees
Abandoned cars
On Tennessee streets
My plans for living
Have been a go
Back in the winter of fifty-one
No trains, there was no way out this city
Grounded planes, the sky it cried in pity
Lonely days and the nights were far too long
In the winter of fifty-one
A rain of sleet brings a firework show
That pops and bangs as electric lights glow
We looked for shelter, there was nowhere to run
Back in the winter of'51
No trains, there was no way out this city
Grounded planes, the sky it cried in pity
Lonely days and the nights were all so long
In the winter of'51
In the winter of'51
