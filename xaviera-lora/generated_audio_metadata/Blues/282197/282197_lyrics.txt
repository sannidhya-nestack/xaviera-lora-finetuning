No laughing matter
The way I'm feeling today
No laughing matter
Rich man's getting richer
Poor man's getting poorer
The man in the middle
He's almost invisible and it's no laughing matter
The way I'm feeling today, no laughing matter
We're all in the same boat
Trying to keep the damn thing afloat
And it's no laughing matter
Believe I am drifting away
It outsourced your life
Oh baby, baby
Bringin' on a lot of scribe
Hey, I'm lookin', lookin' at the future
Lookin' at the past
I just wanna cover my eyes
More things change, more things stay the same
When greed's on top, it ain't never ever gonna stop
And it's no laughing matter, the way I'm feeling today
No laughing matter
You know the truth hurts, and there ain't no pity
'Cause I ain't lyin' and things ain't pretty
So no laughing matter the way I'm feeling today
No laughing matter
No laughing matter the way I'm wild
The way I'm feeling today
No laughing matter
No laughing matter
Oh and it's no laughing matter
No laughing matter
No laughing matter
Yeah we're all in the same boat
Tryin' to keep the damn thing afloat
And it's no laughing matter
Believe I am driftin' away
