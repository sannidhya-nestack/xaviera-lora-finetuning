One day you might be married
With a couple children and a dog
The next you're living in an alley
Just sleeping like it ain't long
Cause you don't know
No you just can't see
What's around the next vent
You don't know
We're all riding down that
Twisted road of life
Today could be a ketchup sandwich
And cardboard in your shoes
Tomorrow could bring you money
Women and fame could chase away your blues
But you don't know
No, you just can't see
What's around the next bend
You don't know
We're all right in the end
Twisted road of life
You know you'd think that wisdom would come with the passing years
But I just keep getting numbered
And I'm bound to shed more tears
Cause I don't know
No I just can't see
What's around the next bend
I don't know
I'm just riding down that twisted road of life
You may try to take a detour
To attempt to change your fate
But from the moment that you draw your first breath
It's already much too late
Cause you don't know
No you just can't see
What's around the next bend
You don't know
We're just riding down that
Twisted road of life
Keys please
