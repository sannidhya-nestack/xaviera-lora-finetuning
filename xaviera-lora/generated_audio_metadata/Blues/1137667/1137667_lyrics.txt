Got a message from the parcel
Mama might not have too long
Gotta get my ticket home, boy
Singin' some more blues songs
Well, I'm a troubadour
Travelin' all around the land
I played a song in Chicago
Down to the Rio Grande
The blues have been my partner
Throughout all the years
Through times of good and bad
Help me ease my troubles and fears
But it's looking like it's time
To put it all in the past
Gotta get my shit together
Get on home at last
Wait for me, mama, your boy is on his way
I know it's been a long time and there's nothing I can say
But I'm gonna get that ticket, get myself on home
Never can leave you sitting waiting all alone
Got a message from the possum
Mama might not have too long
Gonna get that ticket home boy
Singing some more blues songs
So plug whistle blow
Let the smoke pour from the stack
I'm really on my way now
I'm on my way back
Gonna tell you all of my stories
Where I've been and gone
How I made my living
Singing these sad old blues songs
I'm here now, mama
I'm walking to your door
Your Roman sun is home now
Won't be going away no more
