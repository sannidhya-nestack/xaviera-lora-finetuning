My only friend now is the bottle
All the rest have run away
The only one I can talk to is a bottle
Right now I don't have much to say
Woke up all bruised and bloody
Banged my head on a barroom floor
Last night they tell me I fell over
Don't think I can take anymore
I need someone to help me stay sober
My body's screaming for the next year of life
All this poison that's flown inside me
Will be the death of me one of these nights
I need someone to help me stay sober
My body's screaming for the luxury of life
All this poison that's flown inside me
Will be the death of me one of these nights
One of these nights, one of these nights
Right now my friend is the bottle
I feel it helps me through my pain
One more for the road I ask the barman
He tells me I've had too much again
Lost the only one I cared for
She upped and left me long time ago
I remember the good times before then
Where is she now, I just don't know
Every day I look in the mirror
I just don't like what I see
Lost and lonely I keep drifting
Like an old man ship on the open sea
I need someone to help me stay sober
My body's screaming for the next year old life
All this poison that's flown inside me
Will be the death of me one of these nights
I need someone to help me stay sober
My body's screaming for the luxury of life
All this poison that's flown inside me
Will be the death of me one of these nights
One of these nights, one of these nights
My only friend now is the bottle
My only friend now is the bottle
My only friend now is the bottle
My only friend now is the bottle
The bottle, the bottle, the bottle, the bottle
The bottom, the bottom, the bottom, the bottom, the bottom, the bottom, the bottom, the bottom, the bottom, the bottom, the bottom, the bottom, the bottom, the bottom
