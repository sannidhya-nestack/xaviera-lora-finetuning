Hug me, squeeze me, never let me go
I said hug me, squeeze me, never let me go
You're the finest love that I've ever known
Oh how can I help but love you
When you're always on my mind
Said how can I help but love you
When you're always on my mind
If I'm not supposed to love you
Won't you please give me a sign
If you find the time to love me
I will never let you down
If you find the time to love me
I will never let you down
So you won't ever have to be lonely
I will always be around
