I'm really wild, man
I've lost my style, man
Heavy weather and done too soon
One of the stronger made
Often the weak ones fade
They say if you live your time will come
I guess I'm the lucky one
Won't have to cut and run
You know my little disposition's safe, yes it is
Old rocking chairs waiting, I'm anticipating
That homegrown something and old blue moon
It'll come as a blessing, won't keep me guessing
I'll occupy a place in this tune
There's gonna be no restraint, gonna be no complaint
baby I'm coming home, yes I am
Now when the money's gone and the spending ends
It ends up you don't have the time
You find yourself without those friends
Who just gather round when things are fine
Things are fine, they're really fine
Now when the money's gone and the spending ends
It ends up you don't have the time
You find yourself without those friends
Who gather round when things are fine
I'm really wild, man, I've just lost my style
Heavy weather, done too soon
When all the strong are made, soft and the weak ones fade
They say if you live your time will come
I guess I'm the lucky one, one if the curtain run
You know my little disposition's saved
Put the chairs on the table, turn out the light, let's go home
