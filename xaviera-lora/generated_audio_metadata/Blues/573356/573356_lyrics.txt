I'm a traveling man, that's what I do
I'm a traveling man, through and through
Going down the road, two pastures new
Just a suitcase and these lonesome blues
I'm a traveling man, that's what I say
And I'm hustling on life's highway
Another town, a new place to stay
I don't need no one
I'm happy that way
Go
Go
You
You
I'm a traveling man, can't you see?
I don't need no help from nobody
The plain and simple truth is I'm happy
I'm exactly where I wanna be
You
You
I'm traveling through
I'm traveling through
I'm a traveling man, that's what I do
I'm a traveling man through and through
Heading down the road to pastures new
Just a suitcase and these lonesome blues
