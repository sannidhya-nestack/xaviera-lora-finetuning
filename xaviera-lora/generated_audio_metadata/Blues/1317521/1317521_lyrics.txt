My love's a wildfire blazing out of control
Igniting desire deep down in your soul
There's a big risk getting close to you
But I'm not afraid to lie
You're slow burning fuse
There's a real danger
When we're together
We're as volatile as TNT
And it's the danger
Of that explosion
Fends the flame in me
Besides it's too late
I'm ready to light
Your slow burning fuse
Your love's a powder keg
Waiting to blow
Leaving destruction
Everywhere you go
I won't heed your warning
I'm not confused
I'm not afraid to lie
A slow burning fuel
There's a real danger when we're together
We're as volatile as TNT
And it's the danger of that explosion
Fends the flame in me
Besides it too late
Ain't much we can do
I'm ready to light
Your slow burning fuse
If I die this is the way I wanna go
Being with you when our worlds explode
There's a real danger when we're together
We're as volatile as TNT
And it's the danger of that explosion
Fans the flame in me
Besides it's too late
Ain't much we can do
I already lit
Your slow burning fuse
