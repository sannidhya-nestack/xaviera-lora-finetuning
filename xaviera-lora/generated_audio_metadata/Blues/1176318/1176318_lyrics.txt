Feels like a Saturday night on a Monday afternoon
Sitting here at home with you just to party for two
We could go out dancing but we can do that here just fine
So put some soft music on and open up that wine
Anytime we get together love is all, all that matters
No matter what we're doing wherever we are
Every night's a big celebration
We're in a good situation
In each other's arms
It should feel right at the time
We don't need a tropical island for the state of mind we're in
No need for reservations at the Holiday Inn
We take it minute by minute and make every minute count
And it ain't nobody's business what we're doing right now
Anytime we get together
Love is all that matters
No matter what we're doing
Wherever we are
Every night's a big celebration
We're in a good situation
In each other's arms
It sure feels right anytime
We don't need no schedule when we're making love
We got each other baby and baby that's enough
Anytime we get together
Love is all, all that matters
No matter what we're doing
Wherever we are
Every night's a big celebration
We're in a good situation
In each other's arms
It sure feels right
Anytime, mm-mm
Anytime, anytime
Anytime, anytime, anytime, anytime
It's you
