Sitting alone with a bed and frown
Reflecting on life when the blues comes around
Drifting away to a distant shore
Trying to play my escape
The night of the dark like a ball from the blue
You sent me a song and the world sang so too
You showed me a place where the crystal clear
And soon I ot all my fears, the colors are bright
They flow from the river of life
The angel flew by
And sold me in the river of life
Donning for the sun on the lunar phase
Receiving the light from that enchanted place
I'm moving on out from the dampest past
And now there is no going back
You hope and et, step out of the blue
This time may you saw all the words they come true
Or fall on your back where the water flows
And say this will never roll over the colors of rain
The flow from the river of life
The angel flew by
And showed me the river of life
The colors of life
They'll flow from the river of life
The hand of goodbye
And show me the river of life
The colors turn bright
They flow from the river of light
The angels float by
And show me the river of life
The cold ocean bright
That flow from the river of life
The hand that flew by
I saw me the river of life
I saw me the river of life
I saw me the river of life
