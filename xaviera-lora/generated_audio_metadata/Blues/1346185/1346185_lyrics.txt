I'm itchin' (I'm itchin')
Agin' for somethin' new
I'm itchin' (I'm twitchin')
For some changin' of news
I'm itchin', I'm scratchin'
To see something new hatchin'
Oh, I'm itchin' (I'm itchin') for somethin' new
I'm waitin' (I'm waitin') for the page to turn
I'm waitin' (It's frustrating) my life's on slow burn
I'm waiting, I'm biting
Biting my time that keeps sliding
I'm waiting (I'm waiting) for that fix to turn
I'm yearning (I'm yearning) I feel it in my soul
I'm yearning (heart's burning) oh I want to roll
I'm yearning, I'm craving
Something dear, sanity saving
I'm yearning (I'm yearning)
I feel it in my soul
Guitar!
I'm itchin' for a new dope
Itchin' in repetition
I want to be reborn
I'm itchin' I'm scrapin' nothing much new happenin'
Oh I'm itchin' (I'm itchin') oh I'm itchin' oh (I'm itchin')
I'm itchin' I'm scrapin' nothin' much new happenin'
Oh I'm itchin' (I'm itchin') oh I'm itchin' oh (I'm itchin')
I'm itchin', I'm scrappin', nothing much new happenin', no, I'm itchin' for a new door
I'm itchin', I'm itchin' for somethin' new, for somethin' new, for somethin' new
