Well, I'm a road man, honey, I roll from town to town
Never stopped too long nowhere
I don't like hanging around
I play the local juke joints each and every night
Pick up my money don't hang around for no fight
Road man honey gotta move on down the line
Well the other night we're playing
I saw you standing there
In your high-heeled sneakers
With your long, long hair
Well, you made me feel like staying
But I didn't stand a chance
The guy you left before
He posed you up for a dance
Oh, man, honey, gotta move on down the line
Talk is cheap, actions speak louder than words
And you got nothing new to say
And what you did saves for the birds
I play the local juke joints each and every night
Think of my money, don't hang around for no fight
Old man, honey, gotta move on down the line
Well everywhere I go now people love to hear me play
And as much as I'd love to I really just can't stay
the thought of you and him drives me out of my mind
Can't take it baby not just one more time
Rugman honey gotta move on down the line
I said talk is cheap, actions speak louder than words
You got nothing new to say, and what you did since forty-first
I play the local juke joints each and every night
Pick up my money, don't hang around for no fight
Roman honey, moving on down the line
It's that time again, woman, yeah, I'm all done here
I'll be on my way now, that you have no fear
If you ever think of leaving the man you left before
Don't look at me, I'll show you the door
Rope man, honey, gotta move on down the line
'Cause I'm a rockman, honey, movin' on down the line
