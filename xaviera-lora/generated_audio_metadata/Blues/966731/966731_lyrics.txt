They follow behind me
When your love is around
But whenever you stray far from me
They always chase me down
They're called the blues
Some of my closest friends
But friends aren't what I need right now
I need your loving now and then
But when you were by my side
The blues they'd run and hide
But then you went away
Now my friends are back to stay
They're called the Blues
Some of my closest friends
My friends aren't what I need right now
I need your loving arms again
But when you were by my side
The blues they'd run and hide
But then you went away
Now my friends are back to stay
They're called the Blues
Some of my closest friends
And thank God for my friends
You're gone so long
They'll get me through again
