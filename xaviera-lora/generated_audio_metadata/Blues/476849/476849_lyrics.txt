Old winter's got a hold on me and I'm feeling real low
My knees are knocking, I'm moving real slow
I miss that glow, glow of your sweet smiling face
Baby you got the heat, the heat to warm up this whole place
I'm all snowed in, I can't call you on the phone
The lines are down and I'm here all alone
I need that warm glow of your sweet smiling face
You're the answer to my problem, the chill in this space
Baby you got the heat, the heat to warm up this whole place
Yeah, you got the heat to warm up this whole place
