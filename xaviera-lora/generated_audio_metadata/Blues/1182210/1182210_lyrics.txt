Baby you treated me wrong, treated me wrong again
Baby you treated me wrong, keep on lying to all my friends
Treated me wrong, time and time again
But I don't know why
You've been lying to all my friends
I never was the mess I put up with you
When you're screaming out of your head
I'm asked I don't walk out on you
And all the crazy things you said
Have even turned me wrong
Time and time again
And I don't know why
You snap before you bend
But everyone's a mess to put up with you
And scream until you're blue
A mess that don't walk out on you
And all the selfish things you do
When you're cheating me around
Time and time again
I don't know why
You're still sleeping in my bed
I don't know why
My heart won't let it in
