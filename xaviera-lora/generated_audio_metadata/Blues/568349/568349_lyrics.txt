I can't hardly wait to see that pretty girl at my door
I can't hardly wait to see that pretty girl at my door
Well it's been a long time baby and I can't wait anymore
I can't hardly wait to hold you in my arms like before
I can't hardly wait to hold you in my arms like before
Well I miss you so much baby and I can't wait anymore
I can't hardly wait to see your smiling face I just adore
I can't hardly wait to see your smiling face I just adore
Well, I wanna kiss you baby, I just can't wait anymore
I can't hardly wait till both of us are dancing on my floor
I can't hardly wait
So both of us are dancing on my floor
Well I've been so worried baby
I just can't wait anymore
