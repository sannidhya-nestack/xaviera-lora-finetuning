It's three thirty a .m. and you're in my thoughts again
And you'll be there for a while, no doubt
I'm just waiting for dawn
Wondering where we went wrong
But then when I finally figure it out
I go off into a dream
And the dream is telling me
Relax, it's three thirty a .m.
It's 3 .50 AM when I wake up again
And I just can't seem to get back to sleep
I can hear the clock tick
I can hear the faucet drip
I can hear the distant car horn go beep, beep
But I can't seem to move
So I lie here in this groove
Wanting you at three fifty a .m.
It seems like this is the only time
That I get to be with you
So till you and I are together again
Three thirty we'll just have to do
Now the sun's sneaking up
And I've had my second cup of Java
I think I'll survive
I'll get dressed, find the door
Face the traffic, but what for?
When I hit the street, I'm barely alive
I'll get through this day, I guess
But I have to confess
I wish it was three thirty a .m.
it's the only time I get
To save up my regret
All I have is three thirty a .m.
All I have is three-thirty a .m.
