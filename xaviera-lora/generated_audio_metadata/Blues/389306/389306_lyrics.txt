You hold my hand
So nice and tight
Whisper to me baby
Well everything's alright
But I got a bad bad feeling
That you done me wrong
Oh honey, honey, what do you do when I'm gone?
Say I'm your one and only
Keep me to yourself
Oh, but I heard talk
Yeah, you got someone else
And I got a bad, bad feeling
That you're doing me wrong
Oh honey, honey, what do you do
When I'm gone?
Oh every night and every day
And they say when the cat's away you know the miles will play
Well but I got nine lives lord lord I can't afford
Rolled a waist one on you
Then you know I still have
Mmm I still have eight more
I got my guitar
And my suitcase packed
Well I'll be long gone
Time better you get back
I don't want no feeling
Now you're doing me wrong
Oh honey, honey what do you do
Yeah when I'm gone
Well, every night, yeah, yeah, and every day
When the cat's away, they say the mouse will play
Oh, but I got nine lives, oh, that I can't afford
Yeah, I do raise one on you
Babe, I still have, still have eight more
Well, I got my guitar
And my suitcase packed
And I'll be long, long gone, baby
By the time that you get back
And I don't want no woman
No, and don't get me wrong
Honey, honey, honey, what do you do?
Yeah, baby now, what do you do?
Oh, honey, honey, what do you do?
Well, when I'm gone
