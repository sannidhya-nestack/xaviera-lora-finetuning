I can't believe you say our love is through
I can't believe I heard those words come from you
It's more than I can take, more than I bargained for
This loneliness just keeps growing more and more
Now here I sit all alone in this room
Tears flow through the night and most of the daytime too
Mama always said things happen for the best
This pain hurts worse than the rest
Once we were one and now we're just two
Lonely people in search of someone new
And as time goes by I'm sure I'll find someone who
Take this place of you
Now here I sit all alone in this room
Tears flow through the night and most of the daytime too
Mama always said things happen for the best
This kind of pain hurts worse than the rest
Once we were one, now we're just two
A lonely people in search of someone new
And as time goes by, I'm sure I'll find someone who
Take this place of you
I can't believe you say our love is through
I can't believe I heard those words come from you
It's more than I can take, more than I bargained for
This loneliness just keeps growing more
I can't believe you say our love is through
