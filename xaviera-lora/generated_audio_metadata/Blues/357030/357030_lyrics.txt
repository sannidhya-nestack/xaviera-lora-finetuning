No sense explaining baby about this pain in my heart
No sense complaining baby about this pain in my heart
You done me wrong Rudy mama you've got lying down to in our heart
I felt frustrated now baby in front of family and friends
Manipulated me, honey
In front of family and friends
You done me wrong, pretty mama
Broken hearted all alone again
I have no more telling me your lies, honey
No more telling me your lies
I have no more telling me your lies
No more
Tellin' me you're like, "Put that back at your mama, gonna cut you right down the side"
I'm through with crying now honey
Well I've no more tears to cry
I'm through with trying now, baby
Well, I've no more tears to cry
Well, I still love you, honey
Gonna love you'til the day I die
Well, I'll have no more telling me your lies, honey
No more telling me your lies, honey
No more
Tellin' me your lies, no, no, no
Tellin' me your lies right back at you
Mama gonna cut you right down the side
