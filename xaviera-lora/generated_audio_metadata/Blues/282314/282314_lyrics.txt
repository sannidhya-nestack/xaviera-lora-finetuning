What's the matter with you baby?
What got into you darling?
Tearing my dollhouse down
We worked so hard
Building it up from the ground
Now you're gone crazy
Gonna tear it all down
What's the matter with you baby?
Tearing my dollhouse down
I used to play with my sisters in the backyard
We had a dollhouse then, it was built on children's whims
I was a grown up woman when I met you
When you said I do, I thought you would be true
If I only knew then what I know now
I would've married you baby
No way, no how
Now you gave me two children
Now you wanna take'em back
What did you think they were paper dolls we could just cut in half
And what's the matter with you baby
Tearing my dollhouse down
We worked so hard, build it up from the ground
Now you lost your mind, you wanna tear it all down
Got yourself another woman stashed way across town
For that other woman you're acting like the circus's biggest clown
You think the grass is greener over there on the other side
You get over there baby you'll be looking back over here and wondering why
Why you just had to do it tear my dollhouse down
Think I'm a sweet little girl, I'm a tiger under the skin
You mess with me honey and you won't win
The grass ain't greener over there on the other side
Some day you'll be crying, looking over here and wondering why
Why you just had to do it, tear my dollhouse down
