Down on Sycamore Drive
Old Mrs. Anderson is kicking the jive
She still plays piano now she's 85
She don't believe in living in the past
Down on Sullivan Street
Marcellus Damone is staying out of the heat
From his front porch cool, he got a front row seat
To yell at people driving too fast
On a small town summer night
You get the ice cream melting in the neon light
You got the tough kids hanging out looking for a fight
Down at Mulberry Park two young lovers are carving out their names in a bark
They're making the vows that will break their hearts
And they're sealing their fate with a kiss
Down at Billy O's Pub
Billy O's man is throwing down some grub
The catfish play home and I'm telling you Bub
It don't get better than this
In a small town on Summer Seat
You get the egghead dancing with the homecoming queen
You get more corn on the cob than you ever seen
In your small town summer dreams
You get free hot dogs for the little league teams
The rest of the world is so far away it seems
Down Sycamore Drive
Old Mrs. Anderson is feeling alive
She fired up the Buick she's going out for a drive
You better stay out of her way
Down at Bellio's place
I'm liking the flush glow and look on your face
I'm sticking to bed baby just in case
You want to come over to play
Down on Sycamore Drive
Down on Sycamore Drive
Down on Sycamore Drive
