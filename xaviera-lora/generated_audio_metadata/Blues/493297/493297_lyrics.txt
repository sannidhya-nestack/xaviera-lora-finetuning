This is the real world where dreams are alive
But faith is no longer there
This is a cruel world and we can't survive
If people no longer care
There's no point explaining
No time for playing, no life
There is no use in waiting
No hesitating, no time
Just open up your eyes
It's a cruel world
Open up your eyes
It's the real world
It's a cruel cruel world
This is the saddest thing
We're paying the cost
Of too many broken schemes
This is reality
We've lost every plot
And losing all self belief
There's no real meaning
No sense in dreaming
No pride
There is no use in praying
No hope is waiting this time
Just open up your eyes
It's a cruel world
Open up your eyes
History
It's a cruel cruel world
Listen now listen now
Stop me falling
I keep going out my head
Hear me calling
Now I need some hope instead
Start the action, let the spirit find a home
And escape from this pain
On a mission we will go
So open up your eyes
It's a cruel world
Open up your eyes
It's the real world
Open up your eyes
It's a cruel cruel world
It's a cruel world
It's a cruel world
It's a cruel cruel world
It's a cruel world
