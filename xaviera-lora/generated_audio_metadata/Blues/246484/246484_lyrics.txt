But I'll tell you all about it
She's got big plans for a big old bright future
And she's a pain in her face
And she's setting her sights
But no, no, not on me
Hopefully not on you
We don't need the gold diggers blues
But he's got no brains
Just a whole lot of money
And a nice red Ferrari
Then a five thousand dollar suit
Keys in her cross hair
About to get hit
About to catch himself a serious taste of the gold digger's food
Further on down the road
He's got a whole lot less money
One less red Ferrari
But he's still got his suit (yes he does)
She's moved on
She's somewhere down the road dressin' red while he's killin' blue
And she's gonna spread it far and wide
And she's gonna spread it far and wide
And she's gonna spread it far and wide
Gonna spread the gold digger gold
