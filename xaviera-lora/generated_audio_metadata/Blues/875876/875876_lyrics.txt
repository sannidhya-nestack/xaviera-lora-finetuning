I got an itch only you can scratch
Let's hit the road and never look back
There's so many things to see
Pack your bags, come with me
Let's go, go, go
Let's mone-tate
I'm pretty sure life's a trap
You buy stuff and you manage your crap
It's no way to be free
It's not the life I wanted to lead
Let's go, go, go
Let's motivate
And you have never looked better
Yeah, you got little rules in those cheeks
Right above them there's a twinkle in your eye
I want you to show me what that means
Ah, let's take a drive, find a lake
Stay in the water'til we're shaking and bake
Underneath the sun, put the F in to weekend fun
Let's go, go, go
Let's motivate
Let's go, go, go, this montage
Montage
And you have never looked better
Oh, you got a little rosy in those cheeks
Right above them nails
A twinkle in your eye
I want you to show me what that means
Ooh, I got an itch only you can scratch
Let's hit the road and never look back
There's so many things to see
Pack your bags, come with me
Let's go, go, go
Let's montate
Let's go, go, go
Let's montate
Ah, let's go, oh, oh, let's monetate
