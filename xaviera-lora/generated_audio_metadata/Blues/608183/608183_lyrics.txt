I walk on this street and fall is here
This late September it's cold and clear
Down on the corner people in rain
On Rosemary Lane
When I remember
Your pale blue eyes, so sweet and tender
Like this night, a reckless feeling
A queen of spades, a troubled game
And there's somebody waiting
Tell me what do you think
When somebody's waiting
For a bell that doesn't ring
iven lovers, otten tears
Maybe it could be nice to have you here
I see from my window, I've been ready
Down Rosemary Lane
If there's somebody waiting
Tell me what do you think
When somebody's waiting
For an impossible dream
If there's somebody waiting
Tell me what do you think
When somebody's waiting
For a bell that doesn't ring
For a bell that doesn't ring, that doesn't ring
