Darling, now we've finally found each other
Let's get on with the rest of our lives
And darling, we don't want to fight each other
Just get on
With the rest of our lives
False cause and false living
We just don't believe in it
If it's style that you need
Then we've got no style
All the wealth and the property
Well, we just don't need it
Hey, the sun is shining
Let's walk for a while
When we go walking
And you got your hand in my hand
I've got all that I need
All within my grasp
When I lay down
And you lay down beside me
I thank the Lord
I've got all that I can ask
So darling
Now we've finally found each other
Let's get on
With the rest of our lives
And darling
We don't want to fight each other
Just get on
With the rest of our lives
When we go walking
And you got your hand in my hand
I've got all that I need
All within my grasp
When I lay down
You lay down beside me
I thank the Lord
I've got all that I can ask
So darling
Now we've finally found each other
Let's get on
With the rest of our lives
And darling, we don't have to fight each other
Just get on with the rest of our lives
