Another moon, southern skies
Yesterday's tears in your eyes
Sing a sad song for your baby
I don't mean maybe
Have another glass of cheering wine
Sit back and watch the day unwind
People all around you but the world seems so unkind
Sing a sad song for your baby
I don't mean maybe
Another moon, southern skies
Wasted days, a soul to cry
Sing a sad song for your baby
I don't mean maybe
Tonight
Sing a sad song
Tonight
Sing a baby a sad, sad song
Tonight
Sing a baby a sad song
Tonight
Sing it out loud now
Tonight
Northern moon, southern skies
Yesterday's tears in your eyes
Sing a sad song for your baby
I don't mean maybe
Time passes forward a river flowing free
Days of discontent are numbered and the lover I'll always be
Sing a sad song for your baby
I don't mean maybe
Tonight
Sing a sad song
Tonight
Sing a baby a sad sad song
Tonight
Sing a baby a sad song
Tonight
Sing it all night long
Tonight
Bye
