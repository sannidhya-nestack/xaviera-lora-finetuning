Well I think you know where I'm coming from
I think you know where I'm going
Won't you take, take this wedding ring
Won't you change everything
Won't you change my everything
Well I'm asking you to be my blushing bride
I'm asking you to be my wife
And I want you, want you to come into my life
Won't you be my paradise
Yes, I want you to be my paradise
I think you know where I'm coming from
Yes, I think you know where I'm going
I'm asking you
Take this wedding ring
Won't you take my everything
Won't you take my everything
