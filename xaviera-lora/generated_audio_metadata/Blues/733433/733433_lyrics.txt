How, how, how?
I ride the freight train
Cross the water
Hobo hero selling my soul
I done my own thing
Played my own game
Did I burn my bridges?
Can I come back home?
Ain't no fool like an old fool
This old dog trying to play it cool
Ain't no fool like an old fool
This old dog still howling at the moon
Got a bucket full of tunes ready for the next show
Playing on the TV they put new boots on a scarecrow
So many women now got no names
Made an old man happy blues take the blame
But I ain't no fool like an old fool
This old dog trying to play it cool
Ain't no fool like an old fool
This old dog still howling at the moon, oh
Ain't no fool, like an old fool (I wanna come back home baby)
Ain't no fool, like an old fool
Ain't no fool, like an old fool (old fool)
Ain't no fool, like an old fool
Holy moly can I come down easy
Big mama gonna break my bones
Boss man told me gotta make a CD
Or lose a limo and a hobo back home
Ain't no fool like an old fool
This old dog still howlin' at the moon
Ain't no fool like an old fool
This old dog still howlin' at the moon
Ain't no fool like an old fool
This old dog still howlin' at the moon
