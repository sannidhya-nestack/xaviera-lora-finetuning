You know I love my baby
But I feel there's something wrong
Every night we've been to bed this week
There's been nothing going on
We have a love so strong
But I feel like it's slipping away, ay
There's nothing I can do or say
When baby
Don't want to play
You know I'm home early every night
And I don't drink too much
Even shave before I go to bed
In case she wants my love and touch
Well it makes me feel so bad
And I can't last another day
Well there's nothing I can do or say
When baby don't want to play
Know I bought my baby perfume
Make her feel real nice
Even took her to the movies
To see her favorite picture twice
When we got back home
We were lying on the bed
She kissed me and said sorry baby
Then watched TV instead
But I know my baby loves me
And she don't want to make me blue
But there's nothing I can do or say
When baby don't want to play
Oh!
Huh?
Well, I know my baby loves me and she don't wanna make me blue
I just can't understand this thing she's going through
We have a love so strong and I feel like it's slipping away
Nothing I can do or say when baby don't wanna play
Nothing I can do or say
When baby don't wanna play
Nothing I can do or say
When baby don't wanna play
