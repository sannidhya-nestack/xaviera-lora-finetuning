Your cabby made the brunch on, saying you have to go
Your cabby made the brunch on, saying you have to go
Well if you have to rush off to take your love birth
Take your lover boy in tow
You are a busy woman, you work on the top floor
You are a busy woman, you work on the top floor
Seems you, you don't have the time for your maid boy
For your maid boy no more
We started out together, but soon you made the grade
We started out together, but soon you made the grade
Got promoted to the big time, white and dying overpaid
Hey, have mercy
I'll place you in the canteen
You protect head and all what you see
Pull the brush off, give me the brush out
I'll place you in the canteen
You protect head and all what you see
Pull the brush off, give me the brush out
You're building up your brand and I
Can't be a safe hand
Safe with the likes of me
Let me be your driver, baby
I'll take you where you need to go
Hold the brush off, give me the brush off
Let me be your driver, baby
I'll take you where you need to go
Hold the brush off, give me the brush off
At least I'll get to see you
Take in the light of day
Turn the light to 24
You're giving me the brush off, saying you have to go
Oh, the brush off, giving me the brush off
You're giving me the brush off, saying you have to go
Oh, the brush off, giving me the brush off
Well if you have to rush off
Take your lover, take your lover boy in tow
