Well, my heart's been wandering down this lonesome track
Got no compass, no map to bring me back
Every road I travel it's the same old song
Lost and restless just trying to belong
Oh, I'm running
Can't seem to slow it down
Searching for something
In this worn out town
Got the rhythm
Of a heart that's wild and free
Drive the shadows
Out of my memory
The nights of telling secrets in the pouring rain
Whispers of thunder echo through my veins
Stars bright beacons calling me away
Catching my spirit here in howling sway
Still guitar crying like a long lost friend
Singing through the moments where the daylight ends
