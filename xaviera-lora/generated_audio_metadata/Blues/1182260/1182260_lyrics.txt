Mmm, yeah
Starts in that moment
We're talking forever
Then you're saying
We mean nothing at all
In a blink of an eye
Our whole world changes
Brick by brick, yeah, we're building up that wall
Thought we were one step away from heaven
Next thing we're in
A heated fight
We do everything to keep us together
To get us through, get us to the morning light
Sometimes you gotta fall
To stand tall
Sometimes you gotta cry
To find the reasons why
And when the road gets rough, yeah
It's still the road we stay on
we're both crazy enough
To not know better
I know I'm not easy
And you sure can be tough
This is real, real love
It gets so hard to hold on to each other
When our tug of war keeps us pulling apart
All the blooms come off of our rows now
And we'll keep what's in our heart
Never gonna stop
Given all we've got
We'll find a way
Lean on our heart and our faith
And when the road gets rough, yeah
Well, it's still the road we stay on
we're both crazy enough to not know better
I know I'm not easy, and you sure
Can't be tough, this is real, oh, real love
Yeah, it's a real, oh, real love
Mmmmmmmmmmm
