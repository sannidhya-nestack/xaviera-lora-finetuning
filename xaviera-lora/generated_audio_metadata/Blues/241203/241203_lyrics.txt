There's a man on the bus, he's talkin'bout God and glory, talkin'bout
There's a new foundation, everyone greet each other with smiles
And he knows there ain't nobody listenin'
He knows there's somethin' he's missin'
He claims this world'd be better if everybody was a Christian
Outside it's just another rainy day
That's okay to look out
Man on the bus is talking about God and glory now
There's a kid in the back who's thinking'bout throwing it down
And he says, "What happened to my Saviors? My friends don't come around"
And he knows his prayers weren't answered
Held down in the ghetto, no chances
He knows this world is cruel and he's a victim of the man
So outside, rainy day
There's a man on the bus, he's talking about God and glory now
There's a girl by the window thinkin'bout her flyin' away, I swear
She looks like an angel, but her heart's in better days
And if she knows he's just gonna leave her, she looks to the Lord to lead her
She thinks about the cross and how the guilt has just deceived her
Outside, a rainy day
Well there's a girl by the window thinkin' about flyin' away
And there's a friend by my side, he'll never kneel before the Lord
And he says, "I'm livin' for happiness, happiness alone"
And he knows his truth is fleeting, don't waste no time believin'
He knows we're all human, lookin' for some hidden meaning outside
Rainy day, and there's a man on the bus, he's talkin'bout God and glory
There's a man on the bus, he's talkin'bout God and glory
Talkin'bout there's a new foundation, everyone greet each other with smiles
And he knows there ain't nobody listenin', he knows there's somethin' he's missin'
He claimed this world'd be better if everybody was a Christian
Outside, rainy day
And there's a man on the bus, he's talkin'bout God and glory
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
