Hellhounds and bossmen never let you be
Evil hearted women drove you to escape
Stood at the crossroads, wronged your hands and cried
No one knew you all passed by
Love in vain made you mourn
Hot tamales makes me smile
Still be burning, still reign true
Living, breathing
Bottleneck blues
Your bell house and pride point all night long
Rose up in the morning, biscuit roll of gong
Come in my kitchen, bound to be rain
For until late sang your pain
Love in vain made you moan
Hot tamales makes me smile
Still be burning, still ring true
Living, breathing
Five neck blues
Hellhounds and bossmen never let you be
Evil hearted women drove you to whiskey
You stood down to the crossroads, wrung your hands and cried
But no one knew you all passed by
Love in vain made you moan
Hot tamales makes me smile
Still be burning, still rang true
Living, breathing, bottlenecked blues
