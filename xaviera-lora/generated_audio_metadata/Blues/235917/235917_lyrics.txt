These times is full of trouble seem like everybody got'em
Starts when they fire from the womb and whack you on the bottom
From the day you're born you got to worry about dying
Welcome to the world now start crying
It's all temporary, it slips away so fast
Don't you know that the good things just don't last
You could spend all your money
But time ain't for the buying
Welcome to the world
Now start crying
There's no use running
Said it's bound to find ya
The truth of the matter
Is just a few steps behind ya
When you jump out of the shadows baby
Let me remind ya
Be careful of the light
It just might blind you
Why y'all feeling so happy
Said you found true love, ha
She said that you're the only boy that she's dreaming of
Until you see her with him
Now you know she been lying
Welcome to the world
Now start crying
There's no use running'til it's bound to find you
But you don't matter, it's just a few steps behind you
When you jump out of the shadows, baby, let me remind you
Be careful of the light, lord, it just might blind you
Well, lots of folks live in a fantasy world
But you better get ready, all you boys and girls
When reality hits you there won't be no denying
Welcome to the world now start crying
Welcome to the world now start crying
Welcome to the world now start crying
Welcome to the world now start crying
Welcome to the world now start crying
