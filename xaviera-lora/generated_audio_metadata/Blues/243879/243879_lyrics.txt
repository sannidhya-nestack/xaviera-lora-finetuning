And we all happy campers
When the weekend rolls around
We can just sit in our beach chairs, yeah
Watch the rum tumble down
And we all
Got our reasons for things, the things that we do
We all got our reasons for things, the things that we do
And we all
Ya'll got the working man blues
And we all, we all got things to lose, oh yeah
But somehow, somehow we always see it through, oh no
Despite having
And days work him and lose
Yeah, well, we are working nine to five
Lord, how we get beat down
Then we come home to our women
And we go out and we paint the town
And we are
Got our reasons for things
The things that we do
We all got our reasons for things
The things that we do
And we all got to work in man blues
That we all, we all got things to lose, oh yeah
But somehow, somehow we always see it through, oh no
Despite having
These rocking man blues
Despite having these rocking man blues
