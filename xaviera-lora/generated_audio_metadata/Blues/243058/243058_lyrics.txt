Words
Spilled from my heart
Like tiny grains of sand
I try to hold on
I try to make some sense of it all
My mind became so distant
Since I grew taller
Spoken like silence from another world
Civilizing beauty like the memory of a child
Not burned by fire
I lighten up my dreams
The beauty in your eyes tonight
A reflection of your soul
A beautiful lover
Beautiful lover
Beautiful lover
