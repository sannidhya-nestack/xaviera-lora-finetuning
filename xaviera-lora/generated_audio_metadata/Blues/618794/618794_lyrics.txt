I've been standing in the shadows
Since you left me with the blues
I'm fighting back the tears
But the pain keeps driving through
Guess I'll have another whiskey
Drink away the sorry truth
Now I'm searching for the answer
And I keep on asking why, oh why?
Every road just leads to bluesville
On this rollercoaster ride
You see a bad look comes a callin'
It happens every single time
I just don't know what to do, know what to do now
Like I'm going round in circles
Since you left me with the blues
