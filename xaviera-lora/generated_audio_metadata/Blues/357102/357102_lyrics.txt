When I'm at home alone in the night
I think of you with your man by your side
It chills me to the bone
It drives me insane how I let you go
But I know I'm to blame
You know how much I want you
Lord knows that's how much
I can have you
I miss your smile
I miss your laugh
Oh, and with this loneliness
This emptiness fast
I need to hold you
I need you near
But what can I do, girl
To bring you back here
You know how much I want you
Lord knows that's how much I can love you
I'd treat you like gold
And I'd treat you kind
You could even talk to me
And I'd listen this time
I'd buy you diamond, a brand new car
I'd even quit playing my guitar, Lord just to have you
For one last night
But I know I can't ask you
You know I ain't got that right
You seem so happy now
You got a life all your own
But tears like rain
I cry now I'm alone
You know how much I want you
Lord knows that's how much
I can't have you, yeah yeah
