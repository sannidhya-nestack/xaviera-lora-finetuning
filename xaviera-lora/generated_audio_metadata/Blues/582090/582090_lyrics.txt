Little foul rose with your thorn of ash
Feel the invisible whip
Crack, crack and crack
And lash
On your tired back
A little fire rose with your thorn of ash
Gotta let the dust settle to see the path
Still your breath's all blind as can be
Trying to use your heart to see
Little fire rose why do you bend down low?
Little fire rose with your roots of coal
Shining like a ruby in the snow
Light, light by the night
Come the day out of sight
A little fire rose with your roots of coal
All you've ever known is mo' and mo'
Never an inch will you give
You'd rather live to die than die to live
Little fire rose
Why do you bend down low?
You lay here
You lay on
You lay here
You lay
Scarlet petals soft with pain
No need for the morning rain
You bud tight like a gem
Sleeping on your crooked stem
Little foul rose with your wilted eyes
See autumn's last reprise
Winter climbing high in the sky
Your perfume all but dry
Little foul rose
Little pharaohs
Why do you bend down low?
Yodel-ay-hee
Yodel-ay-oh
Yodel-ay-hee
Yodel-ay
