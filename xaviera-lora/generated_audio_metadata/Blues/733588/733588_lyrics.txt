It's not like me to sit around and cry
But I haven't been myself all night
I'm like a coyote waiting for the moon
I've got the in the meantime, in between time blues
I'll be just fine when my baby gets back home
He has the remedy for being left alone
I'm like a ship adrift, abandoned by the crew
I got the in the meantime, in between time blues
I climb in the wall, up on your call
Walk in the floor, staring at the door
He better hurry up and get his suit
I got this in the meantime, in between time blues
I haven't slept and I lost my appetite
I call the doctor but I recognize the signs
I'm down with something, have nothing much to do
I got the in the meantime, in between time blues
I'm climbing the wall, up on your call
Walking the floor, staring at the door
You better hurry up and get it soon
I'll hit this in the meantime, in between time blues
I'll hit this in the meantime, in between time blues
