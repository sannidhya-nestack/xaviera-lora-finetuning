Well, I can't do nothing to please you
Everything I do is wrong
Well, you got me thinking, baby
I just been around too long
Well, you started criticizing on everything I do
Now if you don't need me baby
Go find someone new
Hey listen to me baby
I hope you will understand
Well if you don't want me baby
Go out and find another man
Now you used to call me sugar
Now you don't even call my name, no, no, no, no
Now when anything goes wrong, I'm the first to get the blame
Hey, hey baby, come over here now darling, let's have a little talk
Now if you don't want my love
Pack your bags and walk, hey
Listen to me baby
I hope you will understand
Now if you don't want me baby
Go out and find another man
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come over here now baby, hey
We gotta have a little talk
Now if you don't want my lovin', hey
Pack your bags and walk, ah, come on
Listen to me baby
I hope you will understand
Now if you don't want me baby
Go out and find another man
Now if you don't want me baby
Go out and find another man
