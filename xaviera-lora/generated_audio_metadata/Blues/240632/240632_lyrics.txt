Well, I was born in the country back when I was young
And for thirty-something years I had all kinds of fun
Been around the world, I'll tell you some
Ain't a whole lot of doin' this, so boy, you ain't done
I ate the worm down in Mexico, drank champagne in France
Met a Siamese twin in Germany, took a little chance
Met a girl in Ireland, took her straight to Italy
Yeah but the one that damn near killed me was born in Tennessee
Said he killed my mama and my private dude
If they hadn't been connection what I'm about to do with you
Took me to the river, what do you know?
He throw one on me and one I call home
She had a sweet disposition like a summer breeze
She had a sexy southern accent made me weak to my knees
Kinda bounced when she walked, slipped up on her tail
She said I know I'm being naughty but I just don't care
Killed my mama, gave my papa two
If they had an incarnation, what I'm gonna do to you?
She took me through the river, what do you know?
Throwed one on me, one I know
Well she looks like an angel in a Sunday choir
And if looks could be deceiving she's no good to lie
Never ever can I never be the same
I don't believe she ever even knew my name
Tell my mama and my papa too
That they had me condition
What I was gonna do to you
Took me to the river
What do you know
Threw that sweet thing on me
Down I go
Threw one round on me
Down I go
