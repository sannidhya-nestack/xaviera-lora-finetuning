I'm walking down the road, walking down the road
I'm walking down the road
I'm walking down the road, walking down the road
I'm walking down the road
I've been around, I've been here and there
I'm gonna make it everywhere
I may come to your place or town
And shake it all around (shake it all around)
Where the air is good
I like the sun, I like to keep moving all around
I think I'd like to come back to your little town
I'm walking down the road, walking down the road
I'm walking down the road
I'm walking down the road, walking down the road
I'm walking down the road
I've gone for miles and miles, stride for stride
And the options are slim as I'm looking for a ride
And I keep on rolling and keep on strolling all through the night (all through)
I just wanna go where I can sit at the bay
Watching everybody, watching them all day
So I keep walking down the road until I get to where I wanna stay
Baby you can meet me there if you want
But I'm telling you now
Don't come here to turn me about
I'm walking down the road, walking down the road
I'm walking down the road
I'm walking down the road, walking down the road
I'm walking down the road
I'm walking down the road, walking down the road
I'm walking down the road
I'm walking down the road, walking down the road
Walking down the road
I'm walking down the road, walking down the road, I'm walking down the road
I'm walking down the road, walking down the road, I'm walking down the road
I'm walking down the road, walking down the road, I'm walking down the road
I'm walking down the road, walking down the road, I'm walking down the road
I'm walking down the road, walking down the road, I'm walking down the road
I'm walking down the road, walking down the road, I'm walking down
