(Slow motion) Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
(Slow motion) Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh uh uh uh
There was a blood red sky bearing down on me
It seemed a good night to die
The folks of the town had called me down
I guess I gotta find out why
Tales of teeth and claws, eight foot tall, snarling evil-eyed wolf men
And the poor brave hunters that did their best but never came back again
The preacher and the teacher said, "We'll pray for you on this cruel red night"
Then they ran inside and bolted all the doors and cowered by the candlelight
There was no sound, only my feet crunching on the cold, cold ground
But I could smell the killers in the trees growling and creeping around
Their piercing eyes burned a flash through the night, burning holes in my heart
I reached for my harp and I took a deep raw breath
And blew out the kilino-oh
Well they howled and moaned, turned tail and ran
And blood flowing from their ears
Well I chased them down, crashing through the trees
Blowing through my own fears
Oh, the leader of the pack, well, he turned and moved back
Hissing and snarling at me
They was running blind, the harp screaming behind
They fell dying into the sea
The town folk's cheers gave me food and beers
And laid their hands on me
And the preacher and the teacher said through his tears
Is there anything you want to say? I said yeah
I'm the killer heart man, the killer heart man
I come down to save your town
I'm the killer heart man, the killer heart man
I'll hunt your demons down
I'm the killer heart man, the killer heart man
I come down to save your town
I'm the Killer Heart Man, the Killer Heart Man
I'll hunt your demons down
I'm the Killer Heart Man, the Killer Heart Man
Come down to save your town
I'm the Killer Heart Man, the Killer Heart Man
I'll hunt your demons down
