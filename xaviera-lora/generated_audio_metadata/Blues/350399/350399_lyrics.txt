I have a system in the kitchen of making a mess
Of leaving piles and piles of dishes with gobs of food for Bess
I tell her how to cook the cow, these tips just harass her
I criticize and verbalize and generally attack her
I know I'll fool her, well maybe I can fool her
I hope that she won't guess, poor Bess
I've got a plan to shirk the work
It's not too late to fool my mate
Now I'm retired I want to play
Instead of doing chores all day
When I'm cleaning and daydreaming I accidentally break
Priceless antiques, which really peaks my loving mate
When she's dusting, I'm a fussing and telling her to change
To vacuum first, so dust won't burst from carpets within range
I know I'll fool her, well maybe I can fool her
I hope that she won't guess, poor Bess
I've got a plan to shirk the work
It's not too late to fool my mate
Now I'm retired I want to play
Instead of doing chores all day
And the wash, oh my gosh, what a mess it can be
To pull out whites from colors bright is too much work for me
Drying clothes I also loathe, how I confuse things there
Put in the jeans with other things and leave the wash and wear
I know I'll fool her, well maybe I can fool her
I hope that she won't guess, poor Bess
I've got a plan to shirk the work, it's not too late
To fool my mate, now I'm retired
I want to play instead of doing chores all day
All these schemes I must confess may not fool my best
But at least I've got a plan
