Love and whiskey ain't enough to carry me no more
Said love and whiskey ain't enough to carry me no more
Help me, moon, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well they can't carry me no more
Let me stagger in through the door
Love and whiskey
Dredge bell tollin'
Church bell tollin', maybe someone dead and gone
Lord, lord, lord
Church bell tollin', maybe someone dead and gone
Well, in the morning
Maybe someone dead and gone left us here to carry on
But love and whiskey ain't enough to carry me
