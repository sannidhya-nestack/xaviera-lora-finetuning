I'm lost in a storm
And the night is almost gone
When things are going wrong
What really brings me down is the way
You won't say goodbye far away from
My long lost yesterdays
Please bring your dark eyes
To the bus station
With a cold jingle of small change
In that sad cafe
Far away from my long lost yesterdays
All the quiet folks as if by accident
Standing neat lines by the drugstore
Looking so hard yet the moving lights
Please bring your suitcase to the station
And we'll kiss like in the movies
Like every hero's dream
And everyone
Whoever sees us, sees us
Will think we're just like lovers
Please wear your dog eyes
Wear your red dress
Moving circles tell me big lies
Let me hold you tight
Make me feel to the morning light
Ah but you see I'm on the wrong side of the road again
For the cold glow
Of your northern lights
And last night I could not sleep at all
There's an old face in my mirror now
Please wear your dark eyes
Please wear your dog eyes
Please wear your dog eyes
Please wear your dog eyes
