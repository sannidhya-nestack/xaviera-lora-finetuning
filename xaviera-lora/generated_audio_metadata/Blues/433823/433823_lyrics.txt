Oh Lord, hear my prayer
Give me a sign that you're still there
when I feel I've gone astray, lend me your hand
To guide the way
Without you
Without you
Give me the strength
To see it through
Without you
Without you
Show me the light
Pull me through
Oh Lord, can you hear me?
I need some guidance
I feel so low and I can't escape
This broken world
But with your help
I'll soon let go
Without you
Without you
Give me the strength
To see it through
Without you, without you
Show me the light, pull me through
I've cried a river of tears
Been crying for so many years
Been through the laughter and pain
And now I need you again
So let the message get through
I'm calling to you until you've answered my prayer
I know you're there
Light a candle so I can see
In the darkness you'll rescue me
I'll find the wings to fly away on the road
To better days, oh baby
Without you
Without you
Without you
Give me the strength
To see it through
Without you
Without you
Show me the light and pull me through
Oh Lord, hear my prayer, give me a sign
