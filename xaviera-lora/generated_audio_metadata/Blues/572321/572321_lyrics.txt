I'm good to go, man, I'm ready, I'm good to go
I'm good to go, man, I'm ready, I'm good to go
You know you fooled me up last time
Just to prove that you could
When you said that you'd always love me
Maybe I misunderstood
But that's okay baby
It's all good, I'm good to go
I'm good to go
I'm good to go, man I'm ready
I'm good to go
I'm good to go, man I'm ready
I'm good to go
I guess I left my guard down baby
You dropped a bomb where I stood
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Least they say that it should
Come on baby
It's all good
I'm good to go
I'm good to go
Hey let's go
But I'm the big bad wolf on the prowl now
Your little red riding hood
So tell me baby, ain't it all good, I'm good to go
Ain't it all good, yes, I'm good to go
I'm good to go, I'm good to go
