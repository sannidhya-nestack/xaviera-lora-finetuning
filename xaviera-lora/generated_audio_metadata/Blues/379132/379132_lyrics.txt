You had the nerve to tell her you was a man
When she could still smell that perfume on your hand
You must be crazy, must be out of your mind
To think she's gonna fall for the same old lines
She got wise to your jive, Jack
Wise to your jive
You thought that running round was just a little fun
But it's like fooling round with a loaded gun
If you're gonna get caught playing in the dirt
It's a three to one shot, somebody gonna get hurt
She got wise to your jive, Jack, wise to your jive
Now love can make a woman some kind of private eye
By the way you walk and talk she'll detect every lie
She'll ask you where you were on the night of the fall
With her hands down your pants just to make you talk, yeah
So you start to talking and your tongue gets tied
Then you mumble something and she knows that you lied
You know someday she'll catch you in a lie
And she's the judge and jury, boy, so be prepared to die
She's got wise to your jive, Jack, wise to your jive
I tell you love can make a woman some kind of private eye
By the way you walk and talk she'll detect every lie
She'll ask you where you were on the night of the fourth
With her hands down your pants just to make you talk well
You start to talking and your tongue gets tied
And you mumble something she knows that you lied
You know someday well she'll catch you in a lie
And she's the judge and jury boy
Be prepared to die
She got wise to your jive, Jack
Wise to your jive
Wise to your jive, Jack
Wise to your jive
