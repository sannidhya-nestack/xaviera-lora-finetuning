I'm a mean kind of man
So don't look me in the eye
Just give me what I want
And then I'll say my goodbye
I'm going
I'm going down that road
I pounded my way to the top
And I keep one step ahead
If you're thinking of crossing me up
Well, I'll make you wish you were dead
I'm going
I'm going down that road
I got both hands on the wheel
And I can see you trying
To cut in my lane
Oh yeah
Well it's a sure bet you're gonna lose
So go on ahead and play my game
I know all of the tricks
And what it takes to win
Don't matter whose foot I step on
So long as I get my own in
I'm going
I'm going down that road
You look at me and you like it
I can see your face and I can tell
There isn't a better man
No, not on this side of hell
I'm going
I'm going down that road
I got both hands on the wheel
And I can see you trying to cut in my lane
Oh yeah
Well it's a sure bet you're gonna lose
So go on ahead and play in my game
Play in my game
I'm going down
I'm going down that road
I'm going down
I'm going down that road
Going down that road
I'm going down that road
