In the shadow corners where the lonely dwell
Beneath the dim street lights I hear the sirens swell
The hollow ground I'm treadin' is a lonesome trail
Do you see me hiding in this midnight veil?
Do you see me hiding
In this midnight veil?
In the glow of neon, the shadows whisper tale
My heart beats heavy like a freight on a rail
I'm searching for redemption in a sky so pale
Do you see me hiding in this midnight veil?
Do you see me hiding in this midnight veil?
If hope's a distant emperor, let it never fail
Do you see me hiding in this midnight veil?
Do you see me hiding in this midnight veil
Beneath the fractured moonlight where secrets unveil
But love won't swipe its haunted frail if it won't swept real
Do you see me hiding in this midnight veil
If every broken promise leaves behind a trail
Of pieces left to gather, intimate nightgale
Dancing with the shadows in this lonesome tale
Do you see me hiding in this midnight veil?
Do you see me hiding in this midnight veil?
