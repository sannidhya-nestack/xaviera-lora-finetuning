Y'all allow me to be silly
I wanna jazz a bit
Y'all allow me to be silly
I'm gonna jazz a bit
I got, I need, I'm telling you things the birds sing
I got, I need, I'm telling you things the birds sing
And this is what they say, matter is not found
The round leaves and trees are not dreams
The angels breathe empty air
The clouds or whatever is there
I got I need I'm telling you things
The birds sing
I got, I need, I'm telling you things the birds sing
Out on a limb
Y'all allow me to be a little silly
I wanna riff a bit
Y'all allow me to be silly
I'm gonna riff a bit
I got, I need, I'm telling you things, the birds sing
I got, I need, I'm telling you things, the birds sing
I got, I need, I'm telling you things
