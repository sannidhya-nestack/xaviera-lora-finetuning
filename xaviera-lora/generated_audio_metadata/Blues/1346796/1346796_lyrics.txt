Everybody wants a little piece of you
It keeps you from doing the things you want to do
And after a while
You just want to hide
You never get to do
What you're feeling inside
My advice don't listen to what people say
Do what you want and do it your own way
The gas bill, the light bill, the cable bill too
And all the credit, the credit that is due
Then there's a car to put on the road
Insurance will cost you a heavy, heavy load
It's hard to get by without the things you need
But don't get caught up in your own greed
But do it, do it, do it your own way
Yeah, you do it your own way
Do it, do it, do it your own way
Yeah, you do it your own grief
Do it, do it, do it your own way
Yeah, you do it your own way
Yeah, you do it your own way
Yeah, you do it your own way
It's hard to get by without the things you need
But don't get caught up in your own grief
