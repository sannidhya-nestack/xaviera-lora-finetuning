Mm-hmm, baby, baby, you're lookin' so fine, all right?
Come here, baby, I wanna talk to you a little while
In the beginning there was Adam and Eve
They walked around with nothing but old fig leaves
They never knew what shame was about
They were so happy, so let's try it out
Get naked with me baby
Get naked with me baby
Get naked with me baby
Just like Adam and Eve
Now when I first met you baby
My imagination went wild
What you got darling is too good to hide
There's no one in the place except us two
And all I wanna see is every bit of you
Get naked with me baby
Get naked with me baby
Get naked with me baby
Let's have a real good time there
Oh girl, I'd love to see you in a suit
Yeah
The temperature's rising
The heat is up high
Relax a little baby
Let me loosen my tie
You're looking so hot
You better cool down
Undo those buttons
Leave your clothes on the ground
And get naked with me baby
Yeah
Get naked with me baby
Hey, get naked with me, baby
Let's have a real good time, come on, yeah
Get naked with me, baby
Get naked with me, baby
Hey, get naked with me, baby
Let's have a real good time, come on, yeah
Get naked with me baby (uh-huh, that's right)
Get naked with me baby (yeah, you can just, uh)
Get naked with me baby (I'm just a little button-head, girl, come on)
Get naked with me baby (mmm, yeah, yeah)
Get naked with me baby (yeah, yeah, that's fine with me)
Get naked with me baby (hey, yeah)
Get naked with me baby (yeah, yeah, they can come off too, come on)
Get naked with me baby (oh girl you need a license to look like that)
Get naked with me baby (mm mm mm yeah)
Get naked with me baby (mm come over here move a little closer)
Get naked with me baby (oh yeah)
Get naked with me baby
Get naked with me baby (baby, baby, baby)
Get naked with me baby (so fine, so fine)
Get naked with me baby (yeah, come on)
Get naked with me baby (you got this)
