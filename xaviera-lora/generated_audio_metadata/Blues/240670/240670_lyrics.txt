I'm gonna tell you something baby'bout the way you've been treating me
The way I work like a dog while you footloose and fancy free
I get up every morning just to make you toast
You got a pretty dark tan, I'm as white as a ghost
When you want a drink I go and pour you a shot
If that don't get it baby it ain't gonna get got
When you say leap I jump like a frog
When you give me a whistle I run like a dog
You got me to take you out and paint the town red
I woke up this morning I had rocks in my head
You wanted a boat I went and bought you a yacht
If that don't get it then it ain't gonna get got
Just to go out dancing I had to buy you a dress
When you want my opinion I say you look your best
You get everything I get wrecked over the colds
I'm a walking, talking, remote control
Whenever you need money I go and get you the dough
When you wanted a car I bought a 5 .0
When you need some loving I give you a thrill
When you get a headache I go and get you a pill
I buy you a drink whenever you get hot
If fat don't get it baby it ain't gonna get got
It ain't gon' get got now
I'll get it
It ain't gon' get got
It ain't gon' get me got it
It ain't gon' get me got it
It ain't gon' get me got it
It ain't gon' get me got it
Naw, it ain't gon' get me got it
It ain't gon' get me got it
