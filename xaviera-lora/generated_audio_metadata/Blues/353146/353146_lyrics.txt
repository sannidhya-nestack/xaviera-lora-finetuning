You get to me
You undo me
You
Never really knew me
You got my heart like a cyclone
You got my heart in a hot store
You stir me up when you transform
How'd I get back?
You
Unglued me
You shot through me
You never really knew me
You kind of like Cyclone
You got my heart in a hot storm
You sign me up when they transform into a jawbreaker
Jawbreaker, Jawbreaker
You don't know what you've done to me
Feels like you just went right through me
Jaw, Jaw, Jawbreaker
You, are you around me?
You, you are still
You, you never really knew me
You come on like cyclone
You got my heart in a hot sun
You stir me up when you transform into a jawbreaker
Jawbreaker, jawbreaker, jawbreaker
You don't know what you do to me
Feels like you just went right through me
Jaw, jaw, jawbreaker
