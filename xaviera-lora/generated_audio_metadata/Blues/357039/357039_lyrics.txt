She's a lady that knows what she wants in life
She's a lady that knows the sacrifices she'll make
She knows all the rules
What path she'll cross
She knows she'll have this, yeah
She's gonna have to repay
She's on her way up to a high to know
She's in charge but she's all alone
She's seen all the good times, yeah
Now times are bad
Where a doll looking by you
A smile, a dance and some fun
Your time is her time
Her time is yours
But you haven't bought love
Once the deal has been done
She's on her way up to a height unknown
She's in charge but she's all alone
Sometimes late at night
She feels so lost, a little empty inside
Everybody's got a dollar, no one's got a heart
Still she has to work the floor all night, all night
She's a lady that knows what she wants in life
She's a lady that knows
The sacrifices she'll make
She knows all the rules
What passed across
She knows she'll have debts, yeah
She's gonna have to repay
She's on her way up to a height unknown
She's in charge, but she's all alone
She's all alone, she's all alone
She's all alone, all alone, oh
