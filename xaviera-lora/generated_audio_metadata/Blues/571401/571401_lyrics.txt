Lazing by the river
On a sunny afternoon
Drowning in my sorrows
Keep sinking with the news
By the blue, blue river
By the blue, blue river
I'm singing all those sad songs
So dizzy as I sway
Drinking to et it all
But the end
By the blue, blue river
By the blue, blue
Yeah
A rowboat in the distance
Viewed from the river bed
I wish you were there
Right next to me
Sailing on the water's edge
By the blue, blue river
By the blue, blue, blue, blue river
By the blue, blue, blue, blue river, yeah, yeah
By the blue river
