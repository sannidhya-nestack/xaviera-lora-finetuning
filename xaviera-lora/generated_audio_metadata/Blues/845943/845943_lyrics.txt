I remember those days when I was younger than I am
We would run and play the whole day through
And we swore we would stay
And I thought it would last forever too
As we grew and found new people in our lives
We fell in love and I cherished you
We swore we would stay together to the end
And I thought it would last forever too
The wind is blowing strong now the sky is turning grey
The days of youth are playing in my mind
We lived and loved and played our parts
And as the years went by
I thought I'd always have you by my side
The days are getting shorter now and friends have come and gone
Their busy lives have taken them too soon
But we swore we would stay together to the end
And I thought it would last forever too
The wind is blowing strong and now the sky is turning grey
The days of youth are playing in my mind
Oh we lived and loved and played our parts and as the years went by
I thought I'd always have you by my side
We lived and loved and played our parts
And as the years went by
I thought I'd always have you by my side
