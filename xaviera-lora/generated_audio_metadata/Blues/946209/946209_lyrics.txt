If you could find a way to make this easy
You could find a way to keep me calm
If you could trust in me completely
And kiss me sweetly in the eye of the storm
If you could love me when my confusion keeps my soul and my senses apart
If you could talk to me with nothing to prove and
Accept the sum of me with all of my parts now
Then oh how sweet this may be
Oh, how sweet this could be
Well, if you could find a way
Oh, if you could find a way
Well, if you could find a way, baby, mmm
If you could love me when I'm passed out on your bedroom floor
Well I've had my skin full and I'm crying out for more
If you can take me when I'm out of my mind
Searching for answers only questions I find
If you can love me when I'm crazy and wilder in my deepest and darkest times
If you can love me when I'm consumed in doubt
ive me when I cross the line
Then oh how sweet this may be
Oh how sweet this could be
Well if you could find a way
Oh, if you could find a way
Well, if you could find a way, baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, if you could find a way
Oh, if you could find a way
Well, if you could find a way
Oh, oh, oh
If you could find a way to make this easy
If you could find a way to keep me calm
If you could trust in me completely
And kiss me sweetly in the eye of the storm
If you could love me when my confusion keeps my soul and my senses apart
If you could talk to me with nothing to prove and accept the sum of me with all of my parts
Well, oh, how sweet this may be
Oh how sweet this could be
Well if you could find a way
Oh if you could find a way
Well if you could find a way baby
Oh sweet sweet darling
Yeah if you could find a way
Yeah if you could find a way
Yeah if you could find a way now
Yeah
Oh find a way
Oh find a way
Yeah, find a way
Oh baby, won't you stay?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
