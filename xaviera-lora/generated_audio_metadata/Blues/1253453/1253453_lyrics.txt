Saw on any knee so rough and
Well you look down thick you say
You're such a rebel
But when you think'round the way that I came
I know it depicts you just as they saw it
Sir, if you lick me, you try to see a cross
It's all knit in here, it's all open
Where you look down, think you'll say
You're a sight you never end up
But when you think I'm a-waning, I can't
Your sight you ever render
With when you think I'm a wane in my cave
Your sight you ever render
With when you think I'm a wane in my cave
Your sight you ever render
With when you think I'm a wane in My cave
When I could paint too in this true eye
You could scan me, could see me, send shot
Son, it ain't easy, so rough it
Where you look down, take you say
You're sat you ever in love
With when you think ramblin' in my cane
You're a sight you never remember
But when you think'round I'm a-waving my cane
When there were mister on his corner in the way
In the pister of the waving by say
Your sight you ever render
But when you think I'm a wane in my cane
Your sight you ever render
But when you think I'm a wane in my cane
Your sight you ever render
But when you think I'm a wane in My cane
