I was saved by a stranger
And it never felt so good
More than a flash of light
The boy had vanished
A crash of thunder, a trail of dust
I feel so sad, so sad
And in this business, this world we're
I feel this business that is rolling
Praise the Lord for his mercy
When he sent me down a guardian angel
Filling a long bowl
I was suffering
Pick me off the ground and save my soul
Yes he did, I want him back
Bring him back
And finish business
Is what we have
And finish business
That is what we have
Bring him back
To me, please bring him, baby, to me
I feel so sad, so sad
I'm finished business, this world weird
I'm finished business, this world weird
