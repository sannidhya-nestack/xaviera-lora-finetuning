I'm walking down your highway, it won't end
I'm walking down your highway, it won't end
I'm walking down your highway, coming from around the bend
Came up on the grey line yesterday
Came up on the grey line yesterday
I came up on the grey line
They let me off on your highway
She said that she would meet me at your place
She said that she would meet me at your place
She said that she would meet me
Tell me have you seen her face
I've been seeing shadows on my trail
Well, I've been seeing shadows on my trail
Well, I've been seeing shadows
And my soul is not for sale
I think I believe you, that's a lie
I think I believe you, that's a lie
I'm walking down your highway
Please just let me walk on by
