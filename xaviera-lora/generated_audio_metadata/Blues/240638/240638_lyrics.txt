Never been down where I couldn't see the light
Been a long time since I got things right in my mind
In my mind
'Cause when I bleed I don't feel the pain
People look at me and say I'm not the same
And I, I, I didn't realize
Dear love, can you damn your new set of cards?
the hand I've been dealt
Sure is gonna put me
Out of this game
Don't think of the past
Just deal with the moment one second, one minute, one hour, one day at a time
Johnny, Lord, when you gonna come my way?
Been so long since I had it my way
Ain't no lie, I just wanna cry
Dear love, won't you do me no set of cards
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
the hand I've been dealt
It ain't got no ace, king or queen
It ain't got no jack and no tens
It ain't never been done
I couldn't see the light
I really wanna get it right
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Down, down
