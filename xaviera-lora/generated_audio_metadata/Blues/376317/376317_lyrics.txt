Well times are tough so I drink a few
This whole darn world is making me blue
I fail to call you honey and tell you I'll be late
I'm sad and weary and don't have much to say
So you get mad and you run away
But no matter where you run to
No matter where you'll be
No matter where you run
When you're running from me
No matter how far in this world I have to go
I'll find you'cause I love you so
I make no excuses, I tell you no lies
I'm not smart enough to make alibis
I'm sad and weary and don't have much to say
I fail to call you honey and tell you I'll be late
So you get mad again and you run away
No matter where you run to, no matter where you'll be
No matter where you run when you're running from me
No matter how far in this world I have to go
I'll find you'cause I love you so
No matter how far in this world I have to go
I will find you'cause I love you so
