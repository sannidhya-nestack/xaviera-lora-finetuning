I got my four wheels beginning my journey
Four wheels down a road I don't know
I got my four old wheels but they're moving slow
I've got a real late start and such a long way to go
Late again, late again, late again, late again
Don't ask me how or why or when I'll be there
Late again, late again, late again
Well, I'm so sorry, baby
It's not that I don't care
I got a good man waiting down by the river
Good man I'm dying to see
I got a good old man, good and mad at me
I told him, "Ten o'clock, now it's a quarter to three"
I was sitting on the back porch, losing track of time
Watching Morning Glories play the blues on the vine
Laughing with an old friend, singing something sad
How can all that sweet stuff turn to something bad?
I took a wrong turn coming off of the highway
Long time over the hill
Now I'm stuck in traffic like I'm standing still
But when I get there baby I'll make it up I will
Now when the time comes to return to my maker
Time comes, I'm willing to bet I'll tell the band of angels
I'm not ready yet
There's always one more thing or something I et
Late again, late again, late again, late again
Don't ask me how or why or when
I'll be there late again
Late again, late again
Well I'm so sorry baby
I'll make it up I swear
