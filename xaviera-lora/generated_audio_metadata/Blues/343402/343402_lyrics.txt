I've been all across the world
I've known every kind of girl
I get from coast to coast
But the girl I love the most
Is back in L .A.
Oh take me back to my babe
Back to L .A.
That's where I wanna stay
Another faceless crowd
The band's playing too damn loud
Another three bedroom
Can't wait'til I get home
Back to L .A.
Lord take me back to my babe
Back to L .A.
Sunshine in every day
I'm longing for the days and the cool morning haze
When my baby lays beside me
I'm looking down on waves from Pacific Palisades
And I'm hugging on my babe beside me
Feel the summer heat
Sands beneath my feet
Back in L .A.
Sunshine in every day
Take me back home
I'm tired of being alone
Back in L .A.
That's where I wanna stay
Back to L .A.
Sunshine in every day
Back in L .A.
Right back to L .A.
Back in L .A.
Back in L .A.
Lord take me back to my bay
