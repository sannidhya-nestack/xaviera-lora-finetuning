Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
You're talking to me
Talking about what you need
Talking to me
Talking about how you bleed
I don't think so
There's another way for you to go
But you got your seat in the saddle
Got your hands on the reins
You're gonna drive this horse over the cliff
It don't matter if it's insane
Well, okay baby
You finally hit the wall
Things got so bad
You could barely talk at all
But don't tell me
We're just the same
White trash, that's my middle name
They'll just throw you out in the end
Take you'round the block
And all the time
You'll be claiming
You are only getting
Your second wind
I don't think so
I don't think so
Tell me something I don't already know, baby, I don't think so
The shadows that are chasing you
Are the shadows that are chasing me
Don't try to con me
Don't you even try,'cause well
I got a short fuse
I'm not ready to be used
I'm not hanging out
So you can walk over my dead body and then
Tell me I'm alive
I don't think so, fuck you too
I'm feeling evil, I'm feeling low
Don't you even try, don't you even try
I don't think so
We haven't seen each other for years
But it's the same old story
You punch my buttons to see me jump
That's how you catch yourself a little glory
I got the stamina
You got the glamorous look
But you ain't got no guts, no spine
We're from the same vine
Just plain white trash
Eventually they'll throw us both out on our ass so
Don't try to con me
I don't think so
What do you want?
I don't have it
I don't want anything from you because I already got it
What do we want to do about it? Well, maybe we could make our peace but I don't think so
