Went for a surf at six a .m.
Having a good time till the tide came in
I've got the high tide blues
Gonna mess myself tight
I've got the high tide blues
Can't even get one down the line
Paddle for a wave
It died out
My nose went in the water
Made me wanna shout
For having no luck
On my 9-3
Next time I go surf I'll bring my SUP with me
I've got the high tide blues
Gonna mess up my surf time
I've got the hotshot blues, can't even get one down in line
Everyone has left me all alone
Just some fish below me that wants to chomp my bones
I've got the high tide blues
Gonna mess up my surf time
I've got the high tide blues
Can't even get one down the line
When is that full moon gonna go away
I just wanna get into the water and play
Oh man
Better luck tomorrow or check an appetite
If it's not hollow, baby, I'm staying inside
I've got the high tide blues
Gonna mess up my surf time
I've got the high tide blues
Can't even get one down in line
I've got the high tide blues
I've got the high tide blues
I've got the high tide blues
I've got the high tide blues
I've got the high tide blues
Gonna roll over and hit my snooze
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
