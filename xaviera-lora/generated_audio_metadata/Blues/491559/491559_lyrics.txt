Every time I hear your name I get a feeling that I can't explain
And I'm hoping my dreams will come true
Well I can't explain these feelings but they're true
Wonder where you are tonight
I sure wish I was by your side
And I'm hoping my dreams will come true
Well I can't explain these feelings but they're true
I wonder where you are tonight
I sure wish I were by your side
I'm hoping my dreams will come true
Well I can't explain these feelings but they're true
