Here come the blues, baby like bad news
One invitation that we can't refuse
I heard from a bird this marker's due
I look around, baby all I see
Is desperation and misery
At least I've got you for company
If we head out in a different town
You know they'll only hunt us down
We can change our names and flee
But they're gonna get us eventually
Here come the blues
Here come the blues
Here come the blues
Here come the blues
And the word is there after me and you
