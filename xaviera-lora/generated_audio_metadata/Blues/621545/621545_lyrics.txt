I came on down, came right at your door
You left me waiting like you did before
Oh but I need you more tomorrow
Than I do today
Sunshine is falling down on your face
Nothing can pull me away from this place
Oh but I'll need you more tomorrow
That I do today
But I still look at you today
Oh, I'll need you more tomorrow
Than I do today
Just let the sunshine on your face
