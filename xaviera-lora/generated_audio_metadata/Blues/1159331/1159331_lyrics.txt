Well, I love my coffee, but coffee don't love me
Yeah, I love my coffee, my stomach don't agree
So the doctor told me, "Girl, you better stick to tea"
I had the caffeine blues
Just as blues I could be
Without my cup of java
I had no energy
Till I met my baby
He put the perk back into me
He gives me coffee kisses
Coffee kisses all day long
He's a Java junkie
He makes it hot and very strong
I like it strong
Coffee kisses good as any cup
And just like the real thing
They always keep me up at night
Well, my man loves coffee almost as much as he loves me
He takes it black, no sugar, but he tastes so sweet to me
Now here's my morning coffee'cause I'm his cup of tea
He gives me coffee kisses
Coffee kisses all day long
He's a Java junkie
He makes it hot and very strong
I like it strong
Coffee kisses
Good as any cup
And just like the real thing they always keep me up at night
Well you can keep your whiskey and you can keep your beer
And if you like tobacco one puff I disappear
But when I smell that coffee
Oh baby bring it here
Now pour it out
He gives me coffee kisses
Coffee kisses all day long
He's a jobber junkie
He makes it hot and very strong
I like it strong
Coffee kisses better than a cup
And just like the real thing
They always keep me up
At night, coffee kisses, coffee kisses, coffee kisses
So much better than that tea
