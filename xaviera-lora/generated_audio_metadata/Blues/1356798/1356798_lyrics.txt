This could happen to anybody
One second and everything changes
Let me tell you about this kid named Ashton
I'll be there for you
It caused a little trouble but he wasn't all bad
He was a devil on the strings and he loved his dad
Had some friends and rode a bike just a normal life
Mama worked nine to five daddy home every night
And one day after school he got bored
He was playing with some candles in a drawer
He was just messing around didn't mean to do damage
Just a little tiny fire that he thought he could manage
But something went wrong and the curtain got lit
It happened so quick there was no stopping it
He says he saw a demon in that smoke
Oh holy smokes the whole thing's a blazing
Red hot flames and he couldn't contain them
Sirens were wailing his mind was racing
That was the day when playing with fire went astray
Neighbors heard the screaming, kicked the door down fast
Pulled him out the kitchen while the flames moved past
His mama got the call, she was still at work
A heart drop to her stomach, man you know that hurt
Pulled up to the scene, saw the smoke in the sky
Fire trucks everywhere, couldn't believe her eyes
Found Ashton on the curb with a blanket wrapped tight
He was a little shook up but he seemed alright
That demon in the smoke still haunting his dreams
Some scars are a kind that cannot be seen
Holy smokes, the whole thing's ablazing
Red hot flames and he couldn't contain them
Sirens were wailing, his mind was racing
That was the day when playing with fire went astray
All these smokes, the whole thing's ablazing
Red hot flames and he couldn't contain them
Sirens were wailing his mind was racing
That was the day when planned with fire went astray
