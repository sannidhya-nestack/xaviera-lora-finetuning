The party is over, another year gone by
The party is over, time sure knows how to fly
Every bar is gone, including you
I'm gonna hit the road to Illinois
Get myself Chicago blue
I hope it's a good one, the life you choose to live
I hope it's a good one, you have so much to give
It's a crying shame, I couldn't give what I have to you
I'm gonna head the road to Illinois, get myself Chicago blue
Like the rolling stones and muddy, I'm gonna slide my old guitar
I don't mind where I do it, a fancy place or downtown bar
Like the rolling stones and muddy, I'm gonna slide my old guitar
I don't mind where I do it, a fancy place or downtown bar
I might not make it big time, I sure will have some fun
I might not make it big time, I'm a loaded gun
You could have been here with me, you don't have a clue
I'm gonna hit the road to Illinois, get myself a Chicago blue
Like the rolling stones and muddy, I'm gonna slide my old guitar
I don't mind what I do with a fancy place or downtown bar
Like the rolling stones and muddy, I'm gonna slide my old guitar
I don't mind what I do with a fancy place or downtown bar
Like the Rolling Stones and Murday, I'm gonna slide my old guitar, yeah
Doesn't mind the way I do it, fancy place, downtown bar, yeah
