Calling Mr. Johnson
Where did you get that feeling from?
He said, "Son, I don't know what it is
I know that's where you belong"
The wind it keeps a howling
And it's calling out your name
When I voice crash from the crossroads
And you're down that road again
Take me down
To the groove of a broken track
With the neck of a bottle
There ain't no looking back
And the spirit keeps on going
With the soul of a preacher man
And the wind will keep on howling
Steel slide bar and guitar in hand
In your hands
Can you hear the wind howl
Can you hear the wind howl
