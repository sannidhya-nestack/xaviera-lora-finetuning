Now what's the deal here? (We)
Sure I won't play that guitar (Huh)
Yeah (We) like no man before me
So what's the deal?
I've sold my soul to the devil
Won't get it back from the end (so what's the deal?)
I sold my soul to the devil
Unless I could really not care (so what's the deal?)
Been standing at the crossroads and my tongue it was on fire (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Been standing at the crossroads been tempted by desire
I sold my soul to the devil
And I won't get it back from there (so what's the deal?)
I sold my soul to the devil (to the devil)
Unless I surely could not really care (so what's the deal?)
I faxed my soul up to heaven
Don't think that it'll rise
I faxed my soul up to heaven
I want to get out of here alive
It's the end of the highway
And the judges wait for us
It's the end of the highway
Soon we'll be no more than the stets
No more than dust
Sold my soul to the devil
Sold my soul to the devil
I sold my soul to the devil
Sold my soul to the devil
Now what's the deal here, Lord, Lord?
Soul of my soul, surely I won't play that guitar
Yeah, like no man before me, so what's the deal here?
Now what's the deal here? Soul of my soul, surely I won't play that guitar
Soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul, soul in my soul
I sold my soul, get out of here alive
It's the end of the highway, the judge is waiting for us
It's the end of the highway, soon we'll be no more than dust
Yeah, like no man before me, so what's the deal? (No, no more than dust)
Yeah, like no man before me, so what the deal? (Dust)
Yeah, like no man before me, so what the deal? (Breathing blues)
Play, play, shoot, I won't play that guitar
Play for the devil
Play, play, shoot, I won't play that guitar
Play for the devil
Better play that guitar, ride that guitar
I faxed my soul up to heaven
Don't think that it arrived (Don't think that it arrived)
I faxed my soul up to heaven
Just trying to survive
I sold my soul to the devil
Won't get it back from there
Sold to the devil
It's my ticket to go anywhere
Yeah, like no man
To go anywhere (it's my ticket)
Huh! Sure I won't play that guitar
