I woke up this morning
Sun came shining in
I thought about you baby
The clouds rolled in again
I got the blues
Said the truth
Ain't got no good feeling
And it's all because of you
Now I feel alright when I feel all wrong
Been missing you baby for much too long
I saw that girl, I know you saw me too
Man I thought that you would die
I could see it in your eyes
You knew you were wrong
Oh, you knew you were wrong
After all we've been through baby
It's just the same old familiar song
Now I feel alright when I feel all wrong
Missing you babe for much too long
I don't like these nights alone
But since I left, I think I've grown
We were so close, we were like one
Being apart is hard to overcome
Loved you from the moment I saw you
I quietly called your name
Since you've been gone the rain keeps falling
I stare at my windowpane
You knew you were wrong
Knew you were wrong
After all we've been through baby
It's just the same old familiar song
Now I feel alright when it feels all wrong
Missing you baby for much too long
Feels alright
But it feels so wrong
Why does it feel so right?
Feels so wrong
Feels so right, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Missing you baby for much too long
Feels so right
Feels so wrong
I've missed you baby for much too long
Feels so right
I said it feels so wrong
I said it feels so right
I said, I said I miss you baby
I miss you baby
