If you're thinking'bout the bright lights
Well, boy, you'd better walk tall
If you're thinking'bout the bright lights
Let me tell you, you'd better walk tall
people in the city just love to see you fall
If you're gonna do the bright lights
Better take up some do-re-mi
If you're thinking on the bright lights
Just take up some do-re-mi
people in this city
Gonna give you that third degree
If you've got cash, then it's all yours
That little credit card can open doors
If you've a yen to take a line
That little wad will do just fine
If you wanna stay healthy
Boy, you better use your charm
if you come on a little wealthy
You're gonna cause a lot
people in the bright lights
They love to do you harm
Breaking all the laws
If you've got cash then it's all yours
You know that credit card can open doors
If you've a yen to take a line
The little wad will do just fine
If you want some conversation
You better stay on your own two feet
If you want some conversation
Stand on your own two feet
women in the city
Gonna take you oh so sweet
Those night boys breaking all the laws
Just not used to city charm
