So, sick and tired of people saying I'm nobody special
Sit down and let somebody else
You must be confused, I'm not your little muse
I can choose for myself, I don't like you
Keep walking and talking your little games
You're all the same, I can speak for myself
I don't like you
I don't like you, I don't like you, I don't like you, I don't like you
Mama always said be kind to your friends
Everyone deserves a chance even the broken
But I'm independent with no iveness
Yeah even the shameless lie to pretty faces
So sick and tired of people saying I'm nobody special
Nobody special, so sick and tired of people saying I'm nobody special
Sit down and let somebody else
You must be confused, I'm not your little muse
I can choose for myself, I don't like you
Keep walking and talking your little games
You're all the same, I can speak for myself
I don't like you
I don't like you, I don't like you, I don't like you (I don't like you)
I don't like you, I don't like you, I don't like you (I don't like you)
I don't like you, I don't like you, I don't like you, I don't like you
You must be confused
I'm not your little muse
I can choose for myself
I don't like you
Keep walking and talking your little games
You're all the same
I can speak for myself
I don't like you
So sick and tired of people saying I'm nobody special
So sick and tired of people saying I'm nobody special
