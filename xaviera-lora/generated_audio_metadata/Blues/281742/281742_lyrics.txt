Innocent smile, passionate kiss
Designed for disaster, had to end up like this
Although it is strong, it's borrowed and wrong
But I can't let it go
You say it's over and I'm on my own
You're on your way
Why can't it be different
Why can't you just stay
And keep what we had
I'm hurting so bad
On the wrong side of love
I know that you're here to tell me goodbye
But although it kills me, I understand why
What else could we do?
I wasn't yours and you sure were not mine
Gotta believe me, I'm gonna be lost
Lost and alone
Don't think I can make it
Out here on my own
I need you here
I see it so clear
From the wrong side of love
Well, I thought that I knew love
Thought I knew just what it was
Then there was you, and there was you
Does it have to be this way?
Could we ever have our day?
Tell me what I've gotta do
You've got my heart, you own my soul
Driving me crazy
Out of control I'm down on my knees
Won't you rescue me please
From the wrong side of love
You've got my heart
You own my soul
Driving me crazy
Out of control
I'm down on my knees
Won't you rescue me please
From the wrong side of love
I'm down on my knees
Won't you rescue me please
From the wrong side of love
