I woke up this morning and the sun refused to shine
I said I woke up this morning and the sun it refused to shine
And it's all because of this mean old woman of mine
That the sun's refusing to shine out
I've gotta get out of this place
I've gotta get out of this place
I'm going down to the station
Getting on the next train out of town
I can't take it any longer with this mean old woman of mine
She's treating me so bad, yeah
I'm getting on the next train out of town
I'm getting on the next train out of town
I'm getting on the next train out of town
I'm getting on the next train out of town
I'm getting on the next train out of town
I'll be gone
I'll be gone
