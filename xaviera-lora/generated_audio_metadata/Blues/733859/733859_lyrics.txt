Can you hear me calling
Nice and loud
No more stalling
Waiting to move on out
Fever rising
Hot degrees
Tempers flying
Gotta get out this heat
Getting out
To break away
I'm getting out
For Judgement Day
Can you hear me calling
Cry for help
Stop me falling
From the street to hell
Easy action
On the road
No distraction
Maximum overload
Get it now
Break away
I'm getting out
For judgment day
City lights
Destination
That's the right place to be
Can you see me running, running fast
No more waiting, making a move at last
These distractions, aren't as sweet
Satisfaction hovering over me
Satellite's destination
That's the right place to be
Freedom bound
No hesitation
One way out
Out for me
