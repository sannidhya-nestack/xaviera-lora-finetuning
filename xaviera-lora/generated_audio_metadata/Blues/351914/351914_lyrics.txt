I could see the fire burning, baby
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
There's gotta be a better way, maybe
You and me, we'll work it out
It's been so long and lonesome, darling
Never knew exactly what to say
You tell me that you're leaving me
Don't leave me here this way
Cause I miss you girl
Yeah I miss you girl
Cause I miss you girl
Yeah I miss you girl
I've been walking lonesome (I've been walking on)
I've been walking long
And I've been looking for a lady
Who could help me carry on
All just had to face it (all just had to face it)
It was too good to be true
And I'll never find another
Who could make sweet love like you
I miss you girl
Yeah I miss you girl
I miss you girl
Yeah I miss you girl
And I can feel the change of seasons coming
(Real bad wind blow)
And I can feel the cold winds blow
When you tell me that you're leaving me
Don't want to let you go
Whoa,'cause I miss you girl
Yeah, I miss you girl
I miss you girl
Yeah, I miss you girl
Lord, I miss you, yes, I do
Don't I have to let you know
Lord, I'm missing you
Don't I have to let you know
Lord, I'm missing you
Gonna have to let you know, Lord I'm missing you
Gonna have to let you know, Lord I'm missing you
Lord I'm missing you, missing you
Missing you, oh I'm missing you
Missing you, got to feel something bad
