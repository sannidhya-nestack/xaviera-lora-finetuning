Cold wind blows through Chicago
Got no place to go
Call to you like the devil
And you're on your own, you're on your own
Tap a sheet, whip a coin, let it go
No place like home now
Tired subway weaves and moans
A fighter on the ropes
No excuses for your bruises
It's love you chose
Tap your shoes, flip a coin, now you know
No place like home
You set out running for a new place
How long before you figure out
No one around here likes a new face
So tell me boy who's laughing now?
And you
Make a wish, shake the dots, let'em go
Whoa, whoa, whoa
No place like home
Ooh
