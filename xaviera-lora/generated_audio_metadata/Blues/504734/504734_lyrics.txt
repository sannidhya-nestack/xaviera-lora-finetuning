Let me sleep'til daybreak
Please don't wake me'til she's gone
Oh let me sleep'til daybreak
Please don't wake me'til she's gone
Don't let me fall down on my knees and beg not to go
Last night she told me she don't want my lovin' anymore
Well
Last night she told me
She don't want my lovin' anymore
I got myself so drunk
I slept right here on the kitchen floor
So let me sleep'til daybreak
Don't let me watch you walk away from me
Oh, let me sleep'til daybreak
Don't let me watch you walk away from me
Let me sleep'til daybreak
Before I drown in memories
Oh how I yearn
