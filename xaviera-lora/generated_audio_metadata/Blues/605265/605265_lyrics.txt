One minute you're up, the next you're down
Hard to see when you smile or when you frown
Your mood swings like a broke tambourine
Come on now baby, you know what I mean
The time has come when we gotta decide
If we stack it out for our foolish pride
We hang around so long you know
We try to get next to each other
We don't want to collide
But it's a never ending roller coaster ride
Have we stuck it out for our foolish pride?
Nobody's perfect, that goes for me too
But I put good love into all that I do
It seems to me, babe, you ain't done the same
Unless I'm mistaken, it's all been a game
Don't matter who's watching, it's blown open wide
Have we stuck it out, our foolish pride
We hang around so long
You know we tried
You know we tried babe
To get next to each other
We don't want to collide
But it's a never ending roller coaster ride
Have we stuck it out
Or for our foolish pride?
Foolish
For our foolish pride
