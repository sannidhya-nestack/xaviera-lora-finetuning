Money talks, that's what people tellin' me
Money talks, that's what they say, you see
Money talks, they don't speak in terms of me
My natural situation is in a poor dimension
Can't pay my rent, can't pay attention
Money talks, that's what people tellin' me
Money talks, that's what they say, you see
Now don't ask me for a nickel, don't ask me for a dime
Ain't got none of neither, all I gotta spend is time
Money talks, that's what people say, you see
Money talks, they don't speak in terms of me
Speak to me
Well, don't ask me for spare change, that don't seem fair
Any change I got you is hell ain't spare
Money talks, people telling me
Money talks, it's what they say, you see
Yeah, money talks, money talks
Money talks, money talks
Money talks, that's what they say, you see
War money talks, yeah money talks
War money talks, yeah money talks
War money talks
