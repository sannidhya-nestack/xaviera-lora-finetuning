The human brain, what's it for?
We don't use it anymore
Oh, the human brain
That Smithsonian thing
Supposed to show us daylight
Instead we're in a terrible plight
From the human brain
There's no control over what it creates
While we keep making the same mistakes over and over again
We can't win
We're out of balance, we're out of control
The human brains are all body and soul
Take it out, throw it in the street
Get yourself a good night's sleep
Anything not to think with your human brain
Oh, the human brain, what's it for?
We don't use it anymore
Plug into a computer, turn your brain into a piece of pewter
One hundred brains in plastic jars
Can't think us out of who we are
We're on an ego trip
Ever since our ancestors picked up a stick
And brained our neighbor's human brain
We're beasts of burden, never learning the meaning of humanity
All the human brains have all gone insane
We're going down the drain
I don't want to think about our reputation
Or worse, overpopulation
I'd rather go to sleep with my human brain
Floating in its cranial fluid
I'll just stay blissfully stupid
The human brain
Oh it's a cruel thing
Yes, the human brain, what's it for?
We don't use it anymore
The human brain, the human brain
The human brain, the human brain
What's it for?
The human brain, the human brain
The human pride
