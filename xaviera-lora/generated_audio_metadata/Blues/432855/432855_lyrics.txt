A worn out man, the tired soul
Chasing the ghosts from long ago
He keeps on saying
It will turn out right
I want you to love me tonight
I need you to love me tonight
He once had the world
In the palm of his hand
A rising star
The guitar man
The drink took him over
And he lost the fight
He wants you to love him tonight
Says why don't you love me tonight?
That sweet hometown is taking him back home
To a place where he never felt alone
It was always so good there and he wanted to stay
But fate came along and pushed him away
Six steel strings, she's on my guitar
This lonely road has taken me so far
Losing a bottle from my tortured soul
The pain inside, there's nowhere to go
The curtain calls to the sound of the band
I walk to the stage, is this the last chance?
But will I be seeing my name in lights?
I want you to love me tonight
I need you to love me tonight
I want you to love me tonight
I want you to love me, love me tonight
[INAUDIBLE]
