Rolled by any other name
Will still smell the same
What you bring to me baby?
Baby, I feel just like spring
Why'd you have to take so long to come around
You're the man I've been waiting on
Love a man, love a man
Where you been so long, where you been so long
Love a man, love a man
Where you been so long, where you been for so long
I was out here on my own
Waiting for you to come along
Love a man, love that sweet love a man
Where you been so long
Love is a strange thing, uh-huh
You think you're through with that (yeah, I know)
You say, "I'm not an innocent child, I had my spring"
Hey baby, I know where it's at
Then someone palms around, sweeps you off your feet
And you can only say
Love a man, love a man, love a man
Where you been so long, where you been for so long
Love a man, love a man, where you been so long
Where you been for so long
I was out here on my own, waiting for you to come around
I'm ready to get back on that merry-go-round
You men are ready to be Romeos
When you're so very young, sweet young
We women we're kinda romantic, you know
But we ain't really ready to sexually go
'Til we're a little bit older, baby
And a little bit wiser
Then the motor's running, whoo-hoo
Who's around to take care of the train?
Oh, lover man, lover man
Where you been so long?
Where you been for so long?
Lover man, lover man
Where you been so long?
Where you been for so long?
Lover man
Come on baby get on down let's see what you can do, come on honey, show me, show me what you can, oh yeah
Rose by any other name
Will still smell the same
I loved you
The minute I laid eyes on you
They were clear, they were true, they were shining bright
They were looking straight at you, and I liked what I saw
Love a man, love a man, where you been so long
Where you been for so long
Love a man (love a man)
Why don't you make that stand?
Why don't you please make a stand?
Love a man (love a man)
Where you been so long?
Where you been, where you been, where you been, where you been so long?
Love a man (love a man)
Come on baby let's see what you can do
Come on drive that train baby, whoo
Hey love a man (love a man)
Where you been so long? Where you been for so long?
