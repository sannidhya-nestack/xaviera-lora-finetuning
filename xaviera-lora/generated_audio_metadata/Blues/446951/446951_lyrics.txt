A long-legged lady is scratchin' my back
A sentimental baby, her eyes so black
She's lookin' so fine
I know I can't resist the flame of desire
The heat of her lips
She will do anything for me
Fantasies are hard to believe
She's like no other woman (no other woman)
No other woman I've known
When I'm down
She'll say the things I need to hear
And pick me up
And hold me near to her heart
Then she whispers softly in my ear
Sweet little nothings I like to hear
I get shivers
It just makes me fall apart
And she will do anything for me
Then she's hard to believe
She's like no other woman (no other woman)
No other woman I know
No other woman (no other woman)
No other woman I know
When I least expect it
She shows me some new kind of moves
More than I love her
She's my best friend too
I'll never leave a lady
I love her too much
Now I can't imagine
Never feeling her touch
She will do anything for me
Fantasies are hard to believe
She's like no other woman (no other woman)
No other woman I've known
No other woman (no other woman)
No other woman I've known
She's like no other woman, no other woman I've known
She's like no other woman, no other woman, I've known
