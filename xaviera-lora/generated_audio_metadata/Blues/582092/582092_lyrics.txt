I seen the sun set at the break of dawn
As a rose bloomed in the winter's arms
A little match in the pouring rain
Helmed the Lord in vain
I burdened a beggar with money and a home
Walked the water that Jesus wouldn't roam
Sold my kiss to a diving whore
Butter my bread with the mud on your floor
I hollow the tips in the bullets in my ass
Look like fireworks when I cry
The love I land is like a wind chime
It's pleasing'til it make you lose your mind
There's a chain gang of poets in my mind
Breaking them rocks with a bottle of wine
Paving the road to the heart of mankind
We walk that crooked line
And the gates of heaven and hell
Are adjacent and unmarked
They let you choose the door
And there you are
Forevermore
Police getting paid overtime these days
all them laws must be obeyed
21st century rambling man
Make Jimmy Rogers look like a tax paying man
Brave Odysseus ain't got nothing on me
May have been lost but at least he was free
The sirens that sought him wore no badge
Now do they arrest him for drinking behind the mask?
And the gates of heaven and hell
Are adjacent in a mart
They let you choose the door
And there you are
Forevermore
