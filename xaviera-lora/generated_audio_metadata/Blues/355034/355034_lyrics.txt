Well, I'm worried'bout the future
And I'm haunted by the past
Ain't crazy'bout the present
And I pray that it won't last
Don't worry, baby
I ain't got that much to lose
Do my veins run a sorrow?
I'm infected with the blues
But I went to see the preacher and I dropped down to my knees
Said preacher can you help me to put my soul at ease
Said son I'd like to help you but there's no good I can bring
Those who sleep out with the jackals never hear the angels sing
Don't worry son you don't have that much to lose
Nobody wants to claim a soul
First infected with the blues
Way off in the distance I used to see a light
Now the light has vanished in the darkness of the night
When the soul begins to wander and the body is its jail
It will lay that body down to break out of itself
Don't worry baby I ain't got that much to lose
Do my veins run to sorrow
I'm infected with the blues
