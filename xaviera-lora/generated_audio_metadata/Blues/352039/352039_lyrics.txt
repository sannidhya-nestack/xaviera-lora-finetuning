I'm a California boy
But I like it here
I'm an old blues man
And I ain't got no fear
I let it all hang out
I know I can
Just ask my baby
she understand
I'm the Hoot'cha man
Yes I am, yeah
She got snow on the roof and fire in the grave
Come on baby, make my day
Tell me I'm good lookin' and you'd like to play
It don't matter grandma
If I get my way, I'm a Hootie man, yes I am
She says my baby, cause she understand
Hair's gone grey
But that's okay
I don't think much about that stuff anyway
Got me a plan, that's all I'm gonna say
I'm a one-man band, play the blues my way
I'm the Hoochie Man
Yes I am, yes I am
I'm a Hoochie man
Yes I am, yes I am
Yes I am, yes I am
Yes I am
