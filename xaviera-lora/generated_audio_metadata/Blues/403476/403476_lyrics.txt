An old man once gave me a book edged in gold
And after reciting adventures of old
Said it's your turn braveheart be bold
I thought I'd lost my chance
To join into the dance
Be part of life's romance
All my foreboding in your ended know
It took both my hands and it spoke soft and low
You'll learn your steps as you go
And now I have a chance
To join in to the dance
Be part of life's romance
My confidence grew as I looked in his eyes
In that shining moment he knew I would try
I felt no need to reply
Now lend your heart to me
And start your steps on three
Through dance find dignity
