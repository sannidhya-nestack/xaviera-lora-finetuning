I like the way you walk, I like the way you talk
I like the way you look, I like the way you cook
Baby, what I like about you
I like the way you are, I like you in your car
I like the way you act, I like the way you hold a stack
Baby, that's what I like about you
Yeah baby, that's what I like about you
Oh baby, you know I love you too
I like the way you dance, I like your every glance
I like the way you act, I like the way you're stacked
Baby, what I like about you?
Oh baby, that's what I like about you
Yeah baby, you know I love you too
I like the way you walk, I like the way you talk, I like the way you look, I like the way you cook, baby
That's what I like about you, yeah baby, that's what I like about you
