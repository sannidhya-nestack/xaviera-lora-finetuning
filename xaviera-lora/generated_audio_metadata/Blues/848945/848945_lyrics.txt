I tiptoed to the bedroom didn't want to wake her up
I catch hell in the morning and that was soon enough
As I slipped between the covers I knew something was wrong
The bed was cold it dawned on me she's gone
I found her little letter lying right beside the lamp
She really let me have it in a world I'd understand
She didn't pull no punches hit me right between the eyes
Brief blunt to the point of goodbye
That's all she wrote
But I could read between the lines
It told a story about the lonely nights
And all the times I made her cry
She didn't beat around the bush
Just one seven letter note
In black and white, goodbye, that's all she wrote
She spelled it out without a doubt in just a single word
She finally found a way to say how much it really hurts
That lady's quite a writer, that I can't deny
Complete and neat, short and sweet, goodbye
That's all she wrote, but I could read between the lines
They told a story about the lonely nights
And all the times I made her cry
She didn't beat around the bush
Just one seven letter note
In black and white goodbye
That's all she wrote
In black and white goodbye that's all she wrote
