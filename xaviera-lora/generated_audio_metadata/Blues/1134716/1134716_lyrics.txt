Mama says I should go back to you
She doesn't know the pain you put me through
Those sleepless nights, the senseless fights
How could you be so cruel?
Mama says I should go back to you
You loved me with your fist but I've moved on
You're the last bruise I've been wanting gone
The things you did
The wounds I healed
I played lover's fool too long
You loved me with your fist
But I've moved on
I've grown skilled at hiding things so close friends would know
I believed if I gave on your love for me would grow
That choice cost me dearly, I nearly lost myself
I'll learn now how to heal
And I don't need your hand
Mama says I should go back to you
I packed these battered dreams I once knew
Like a thief slips the knife
I'll be gone by dawn's light
Mama says I should go back to you
Daddy says I should go back to you
Sister says I should go back to you
But this time I won't listen, we're through
But this time I won't listen, this time I know we're through
This time I won't go back to you
Honey, we're through
