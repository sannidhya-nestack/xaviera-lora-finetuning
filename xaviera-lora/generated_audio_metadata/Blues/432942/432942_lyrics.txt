She wonders why it's all the same
Little voices calling her name
Everyone wants to be nearby
She'd rather hide under my space lies
Trapped in a life that someone else chose
She thinks life could be better alone
If she were somewhere over there
A mother of five, where can she survive?
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Life lands down a long runway
Life lands down a long runway
She wonders why it's all the same
Little voices calling her name
Everyone wants to be nearby
She'd rather hide under my space nights
Trying hard to reach her, he shows
It can only get better
Her mind reaches towards him now
But pulls back again, yeah she pulls back again
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Life plants down a long runway
Life plants down a long runway
Why can't we let go?
Can't escape this hole?
How can we grow like this?
Change has arrived, she says, tonight
No more tears are falling
Nighttime is calling now
Doors are opening up that wall
Invitations cover up their pain
Their love will not be restrained
His smile draws her nearby
She holds nothing back
No she holds nothing back
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Life hands down a long road away
Life lands down a long run way
Life lands down a long run way
