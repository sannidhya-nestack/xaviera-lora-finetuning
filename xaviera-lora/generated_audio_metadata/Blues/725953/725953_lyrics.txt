I knew the end was near
When the Oracle appeared
He led me to a place
I've never been before
A deeper understanding
Happened in the heart of my soul
It shattered my illusions
I realized the pain I've caused
He showed me that I've never really
Cared enough for you
I never really knew just what to do
All caught up within myself
You've gathered dust upon my shelf
I never really
Cared enough for you
The end is come and gone
The oracle is moving me along
He takes me all the places
I've been so many times before
I try to hear the music
I try to see the light, a deeper understanding
I realize the joy in my life, realize my light, oh
He showed me that I never really
Cared enough for you
I never really knew
Just what to do
Caught up within myself
You gathered dust upon my shelf
I never really
Cared enough for you
Oh, he showed me that I never really
Cared enough for you
I never really knew
Just what to do
Oh, I'm caught up within my soul
You've got the dust upon myself
I never really
Can't enough for you
