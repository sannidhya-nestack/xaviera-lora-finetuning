Blue night, blue moon, blue breeze, arms of blue, blue tune, blue you
Blow me
A blue wave rolling on a deeper sea
It's only a moment and the moment won't stay
Let the moment carry us away
Carry us away, carry us away
Let's let the moment carry us away
Oh, ha ha
You're so very bad
You need to be verbally reprimanded
Won't time make it clear what we're doing here
What do we got to do, baby
What do we got to do to get to a new night, a new moon
A new breeze with a brand new tune, new me
Nail you on a new whale over that old blue
It's only a moment and a moment won't stay
Let the moment carry us away
Carry us away, carry us away
Let's let the moment carry us away
Well it's only a moment and the moment won't stay
Let the moment carry us away
Carry us away, carry us away
Let's let the moment carry us away
Let the moment carry us away
Oh let the moment carry us away
