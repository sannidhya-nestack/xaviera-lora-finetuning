I love Corina, tell the world I do
I love Corina, tell the world I do
Just a little more loving will make your heart beat true
Corrine, Corrina, where you been so long?
Corrine, Corrina, where you been so long?
I ain't had no lovin' since you been gone
Corrine, Corrina, where'd you stay last night
Corrine, Corrina, where'd you stay last night
You came home this morning, sun was shining bright
Goodbye Corina, this is fairly well
Goodbye Corina, this is fairly well
When I get back babe, Lord you never can tell
