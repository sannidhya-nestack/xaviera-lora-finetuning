Nothing can stop me
I'm on my way
Nothing can stop me
No matter what you say
Nothing can stop me
I'm leaving today
There's really nothing to it
All the time you knew it
But let me make it clear
Now the time has come
You know I've got to run
You better dry those tears
See there's no use crying
Baby I ain't lying
I'm moving out of here
Nothing can stop me
I'm on my way
Nothing can stop me
No matter what you say
Nothing can stop me
I'm leaving today
Uh-huh
More like that. Yeah, come on. Yeah
Yeah
Ah
Girl, there's nothing wrong, I've just stayed too long
And there's one thing you should know
Although we had our fun, girl what's done is done
I've really got to go
So take your arms from me
You got to set me free
It's time for me to blow
Nothing can stop me
I'm on my way
Nothing can stop me
No matter what you say
Nothing can stop me
I'm leaving today
