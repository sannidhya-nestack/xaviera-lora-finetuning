Okay guys, we're gonna give'em seven one time.
Seven on the five, you ready?
People talk but they don't say a word
I'd rather listen to a firebird
Or when a Les Paul chats with a strat
They sound so good you know I like it like that
Around midnight you hear them wail
Like stepping down on a hellhound's tail
Let's have a blues conversation
Blues conversation
A little blues conversation
Blues conversation
Lord have mercy who's talking to me in a blues conversation
Another voice that sounds sweet to me
Is when someone's jammin' on a Hammond B3
Guitar and an with their ebb and flow
Back and forth and around they go
They take their turns playin' rhythm and lead
It's Blues Heaven baby yes indeed
Let's have a Blues Conversation (Blues Conversation)
A little Blues Conversation (Blues Conversation)
Lord have mercy who's talking to me in a Blues Conversation
You heard'em sing, you heard'em cry out loud
The way they communicate makes me proud
You heard'em easy and you heard them rough
But let me tell you, child, I can't get enough
'Cause when you listen, you hear them say
Keep talking blues, brother, every day
Let's have a blues conversation (blues conversation)
A little blues conversation (blues conversation)
You got to give me what I want to hear
A little blues conversation (blues conversation)
People gonna shout when they let it all out
And have a blues conversation
Let it out now boys
