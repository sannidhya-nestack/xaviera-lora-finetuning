Old man lying in the street
Ragged clothes not enough to eat
Though I could lend a hand
I don't want to see this
So I will walk on by
I'll never meet his eye
Not much more to say
I don't want to see this
Look down from the sky
To see a sheltered life
Hidden from the world of pain right outside
Like to keep it far away
Leave it for another day
Don't see why I should pay
I just don't see it
That's what I tell myself
No I don't know much else
But all this pain inside
I don't want to see it
So I should just let go
Find someone else who knows
Want to get off this ride
I just can't believe it
Look down from the sky
Don't wanna live a sheltered life
Hidden from the world of pain right outside
Can't keep it locked away
We'll leave it for another day
I don't see why he should fade
I just don't see it
I just don't see it
