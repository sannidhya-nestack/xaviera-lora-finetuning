I got a little red rooster, too lazy to crow the day
I got a little red rooster, too lazy to crow the day
But it keeps everything in the barnyard
Yes, it keeps it upstairs and ready to lay
The dogs begin to bark
Yes, and the hounds begin to howl
Oh, the dogs begin to bark
Yes and how's begin a how-ooh
Better look out right now people
My little red rooster's on the prowl
If you see my little red rooster please send him home
If you see my little red rooster please send him home
There's been no peace in the barnyard
Ever since my little red rooster's been gone
