What's the point of living if you can't see?
What's the point of living if you can't sleep?
What's the point of living if you can't eat?
What's the point of living if you can't breathe?
Give it a minute, it's complete in a minute
You're the best, she's like a mother tongue
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?
Give it to me, it's gonna take a long time
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl
