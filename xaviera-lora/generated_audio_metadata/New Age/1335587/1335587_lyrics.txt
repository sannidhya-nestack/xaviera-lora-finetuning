Take a deep breath in and a deep breath out.
Close your eyes, find a comfortable place to sit
and transport yourself to your happy place.
Feel your body aligned
and relaxed. Now feel a soft glow forming around your body. Notice the warmth around
your body. This is your aura, your energetic field. What color do you feel that aura is?
Let your aura expand with every breath. Feel it moving around you. A living thing which follows you everywhere. This light protects you, shapes you, shows you. See if you can see any holes in the aura.
Anything you need to mend
Mend them now
Make your aura secure
It reflects your essence
Your peacefulness
Your kindness
And your strength
Let your aura become a radiant bubble of calm
Expanding wider, brighter and softer. Feel strength now. And gently bring that aura back with you. Namaste.
