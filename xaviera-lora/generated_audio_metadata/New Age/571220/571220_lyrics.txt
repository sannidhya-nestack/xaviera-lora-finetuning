Ay ay ay oh, oh oh oh, ay ay ay oh
Ay ay ay oh, oh oh oh, ay ay ay oh
Know the bell on the hill and the wind
He's on a ride and I'm far from the sky
All the blossoms have shone down
And the rest we shall have at the field night
All by night one we go down
All by night
For thee I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die
As my death at last
All the grief is gone
La la la la la la la
The wind, the wind, the wind, the wind, the wind, the wind, the wind, the wind, the wind, the wind, the wind, the wind, the wind, the wind, the wind, the wind, the wind, the wind, the wind, la la la la la la la la la la far from the sky
And so long and so deep
La la la la la la la la so deep in my heart
I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die
All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time
