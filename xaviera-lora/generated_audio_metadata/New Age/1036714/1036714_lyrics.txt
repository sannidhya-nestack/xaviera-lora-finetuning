When first I beheld my King
My soul grasped the full meaning
I was overcome with fear
Yet I am too few in near and slight to
My place on the throne in the highest kingdom
That is my own
My heart is open wide
No longer willing to hide this love inside
What gifts have I to bring
A purest light within
The mystery of all ages past
Lies here within my grasp
And so I choose my place on the throne
It is my home (It is my home)
My heart is all that I want
No longer need to hide this love inside
And so I choose my place on the throne
In the highest angel, it is my home
My heart is open wide
No longer willing to hide
This love of mine
No longer willing to hide
This love inside
