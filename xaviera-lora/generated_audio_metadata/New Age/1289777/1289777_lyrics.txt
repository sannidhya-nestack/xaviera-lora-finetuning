My heart is always trembling, afraid I might give in
My heart is always trembling
Afraid I might give in
My heart is always trembling
Afraid I might give in
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-dim, da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-dim, da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-dim, da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-dim, da-da
My heart is always trembling
Afraid I might give in
Da da da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da da da da
To you whose suffering has led you into the veil of darkness
Where the tallest stems shun the light of the sun
And the air seems dank and foul smelling of inertia
Still a moment and listen and in the faint distance
A bird will sing and you will know you have not otten
When the darkness is impenetrable seek not the way on your own
But cry out and say I am lost
Let your cry ring out in all directions
Towards that faint sound of song
Then let your cry come unto me
For I will hear you, for I will hear you, for I will hear you
Open your heart and breathe the sweet air of limitless sky
And warm your face in the brilliant sun
And be at last grateful
Then shall you hear my voice within you
For I have flown with rainbow wings along the web of light that is inside all things
For I have flown with rainbow wings along the web of light that is inside all things
I am the voice of the compassionate man who dwells at the heart of the feminine world
When I speak I radiate such quality and virtue that you are filled with that light
In that light I am present
I am the scourge of all that is dark and defiled
None can be in my presence who deceive themselves
And you shall know me by the name of Rita
And you shall know me by the name of Rita
Arizona, Arizona, Arizona, Arizona, Arizona
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Every time, every time, every time, every time, every time
Every time
Every time
