If any moment, I should need you
I'm right here in your hands, and I won't fear
These precious lives we're living, you will keep me safe
Take me in your hands
And wait to stop my fall
Wherever I am in the world
You're here with me
You listen when I call
You protect me and I feel safe
My life is right here in your hands
And I feel complete
All my hopes, all my dreams, all my love is in your hands now
All my life, all my dreams, all my love is in your hands now
And you will be right here
Watching over me
And you will keep me safe in your hands
Oh, oh, oh
My life, my life, my life is in your hands now
Is in your hands now
My life, my life, my life is in your hands now
Is in your hands now
Is in your hands now
