I still remember, I still remember, I still remember, I still remember, I still remember, I still remember, I still remember
I still remember that first kiss you left in my shed
You drove me insane
You left me with no choice but to love you and make you all mine
I still remember that first kiss you left in my shed
You drove me insane
You left me with no choice but to love you and make you all mine
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
All mine
I still remember
All mine
I still remember
All mine
I still remember
All mine
You left me with no choice but to love you every week
All mine
I still remember
I still remember
All mine
I still remember
Left with no choice but to love you and me or mine
I still remember that first kiss you left in my shed
You drove me insane
You left me with no choice but to love you and make you all mine
I still remember
I still remember
I still remember
I still remember
You were all mine
I still remember
I still remember all mine
I still remember all mine
I still remember all mine
You left me with no choice in fact you left me held in me all mine
I still remember (I still remember)
I still remember (all mine)
I still remember (I still remember)
There could be no choice but to love and hate me all mine
I still remember (I still remember)
