Have you seen the stars tonight?
Would you like to look at them with me?
Have you seen the stars tonight?
Do you wish we could keep them company?
We could awaken our minds high
Our sixth sense will be our guide
A journey like no other
A cosmic wave to the other side
Sailing on the solar winds
Where comets show us the way
Passing through the corridors of Andromeda
To find a place to live, a place to stay
Thousands of light years from home
Multi universes to discover
Worlds we could never have imagined
Exploring new dimensions like no other
Have you seen the stars tonight?
Would you like to look at them with me?
Have you seen the stars tonight?
Do you wish we could keep them company?
Have you seen the stars tonight?
Would you like to look at them with me?
Have you seen the stars tonight?
Do you wish we could keep them company?
