In the healing, the crystal ceiling
Reflects a thousand faces and private lies, alibis
You'll know them by the traces
Of your passion that you cash in, in the night
In the naming, the reclaiming
Of the depths that take you higher
The word magician, the trickster's mission
Bring a belly full of fire
To break the chain of the pain and its might
Revival leaves innocence behind
Survival
Through the mending of the mind The hero's dwelling within
Armed with love's medicine And the insight to win the light
Always the same, the inner game
Of the chalice and the blade
Destiny, the Odyssey
Reinventing dreams you've made
You can hear it in the spirit of the fight
Don't be dismayed or afraid
On this journey of the soul
The warrior's path, the shadow's wrath
Shout the challenge to behold
While the poet's hand understands
