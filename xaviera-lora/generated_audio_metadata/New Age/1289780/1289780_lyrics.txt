Know you, the colours that I speak in my mind
And I wanna take you there, wanna take you there
Indwelling colour in its presence I find
Only heart would take us there
Heart would take us there
I see the skies opening out
Reaching beyond
Know you in colour I hear
Angelic voices
Speaking to my heart
Speaking to my heart
Indwelling images
Visioning the way
I wanna take you there
Wanna take you there
I see the skies
Opening out
Reaching beyond
Did you know that angels speak the language of colour?
Divinity sleeps in us
I know that's true
Did you know that colours are living creatures?
Capable of intense activity
They have minds and wills of their own
We should not predetermine, though
Color is the language of agents, it really is
Vision, the colors falling
Cascading waterfalls, dazzled by the sun
Dazzled by the sun
Colours fall like fiery rain
Upon my hurting heart
And heal me, soothing me again
Soothing me again
I see your eyes
Deep in your eyes
Colors beyond
I see your eyes, deep in your eyes, colors beyond
I see your eyes
Deep in your eyes
Colors beyond
