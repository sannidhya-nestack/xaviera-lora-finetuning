Come, ride the waves of my mind
Let the tides of my love sweep you into my eternal heart
Feel the sacred waters flowing
No beginning or end
Rivers running into oceans
Wells too deep to comprehend
Feel the sacred waters flowing
No beginning, no end
Rivers running into oceans
Well, it's too deep to comprehend
My body
Water my blood and my blood
I, my spirit
Listen to the secrets carried by the winds across the world
Can you feel my longing? Listen
I am the breather and the breath, the singer and the song
I am the dancer and the dance, moving as one
I am the breather and the breath
I am the dancer and the dance
Moving as one
I am the breather and the breath
The singer and the song
I am the dancer and the dance
Moving as one
I am the breather and the breath
The singer and the song
I am the dancer and the dance
Moving as one
Adorned and jeweled I undulate, but naked is my soul
Watch my silent language, read the secrets never told
I sway my hips and armies fall, I conquer with a glance
In this dream where rhythm rules and love's the only dance
