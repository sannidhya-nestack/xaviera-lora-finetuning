Invite in indigo, the velvety color of night sky
Bathe your third eye with indigo
Soothing, balancing, bringing clarity
And understanding
Let your third eye take what it needs
And say the words
Everything is unfolding as it should
Let's say it one more time, just to center it in.
Everything is unfolding as it should.
Moving up, in your own time, to the top of your head, to your crown, your chakra of oneness.
