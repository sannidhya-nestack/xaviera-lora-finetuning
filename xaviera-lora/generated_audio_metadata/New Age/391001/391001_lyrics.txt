Oh, open the door to the grave
And smell the air with my breath
Beneath the veils behind the walls
Listen close and you will hear
My silent cries subdued by fear
If you could look into my eyes, you'd see a virgin heart
For I never loved but freedom, and it's a world apart
Freedom
I wanna show my face to the sun, yeah, me, yeah, me, yeah, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, freedom
You are the dream of everyone like me
You are my hope, you are my prayer
You are the savior, won't you take me where there's freedom?
My heart is calling out to you, deliver me and I'll be true, come take me home to the land of the free, to shine in the light of equality, speak my thoughts and never hide, share the burning passion inside, I wanna dance like a bird loves to fly, I need you now, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free, I'm willing to die for free,
Freedom, freedom
I wanna dance naked in the sun
Have rights like anyone
Bare my soul, shine my light
I need you now
Freedom, freedom, freedom
Freedom
If you could look into my eyes, you'd see a virgin heart
For I never loved but freedom, and with the world apart
I want freedom
