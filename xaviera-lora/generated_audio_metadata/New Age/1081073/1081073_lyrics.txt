I have been embraced by the rain, surrounded by summer thunder
Enraptured by the scent of wet stone and sky
I have been comforted by warm humidity
That wafts through my open window and holds me as I cry
I have been accepted by the raindrops
As each one falls to the ground
Just another ripple
A distinct part of the collective puddle
I have been embraced by the rain
When I cried out and no one else came
Not in the end, not in the end
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Nei, nei hau, nei ki aru
Nei, nei hau, nei ki
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I am, oh, oh, oh, I am, I am, oh, oh, oh
I, I, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I, I, oh, oh, oh, oh
I have been embraced by the rain
When I cried out and no one else came
