Breathe into your aura, let it gently soften and expand on your breath.
Taking in nourishment and life force energy.
And invite in orange.
Bathe your aura with orange
Balancing, empowering, motivating
Let your heart be fed
And see the words
I honor my needs
I allow myself to be nourished
And when you are ready, move your awareness up to the soft area below your breastbone,
to your solar plexus.
Your chakra of personal power
