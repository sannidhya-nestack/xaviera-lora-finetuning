Doom, doom, doom, doom
High in the mountains there's a place I go
Where the water runs dry after the fresh fallen snow
Walking in the redwoods there's a quiet path
And when I feel lost it helps me find my way back
The river of life
The river of life is a heavenly body that runs through everything
It runs through everything, the river of life
Mother earth's veins grow deep and wide
I know where it's going as it travels in time
Sometimes things must change
But they will ebb and flow
And the next thing you know
You're touring the dream show
Floating lazy and free
Drifting with the current
I'm where I'm meant to be
Moving wherever it takes me
The river of life
The river of life is a heavenly body that runs through everything
It runs through everything
The river of life
Mother earth's veins grow deep and wide
I know where it's going
As it travels in time
The river of life
The river of life is a heavenly body that runs through everything
It runs through everything
The river of life
Mother Earth's veins grow deep and wide
I know where it's going
As it travels in time
The fork in the river is a place to choose the direction
Your life will branch off and take you
