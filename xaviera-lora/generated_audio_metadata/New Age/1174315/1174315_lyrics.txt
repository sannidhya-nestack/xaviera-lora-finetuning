Sun is dead
I don't need'em now I do
Sun is dead
Sun is dead
There's a place I look for
There's a heart beneath
Turn East to East
I'm afraid, I need God, dead, dead
I'm afraid, I need God, dead, dead
There is a God who needs
I do need stars
Dead, dead, dead, gone
I don't need to stay
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Not over
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
