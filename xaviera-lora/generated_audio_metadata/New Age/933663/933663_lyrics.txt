[flute]
I cannot believe what I heard when you told me to stay
I thought it was her but I saw that you sent her away
Time's on your side and I hope that I'll never regret
Still I see her and I know that I'll never et
Never et
Never again
Never again
I'm never, never, I'm never, never, never again
I cannot believe what I heard when you told me to stay
I thought it was pure but I saw that you sent her away
Time's on your side and I hope that I never regret
Still I see her and I know that I'll never et
Never et, never et
