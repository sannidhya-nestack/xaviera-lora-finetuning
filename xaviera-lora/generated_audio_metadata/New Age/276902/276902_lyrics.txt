Do you remember that song on the radio?
Do you remember the wind on your face?
Do you remember those nights on the boat in June
Do you remember the smile on my face
Bring me home
Bring me back home
Do you remember the summer nights in New York
Do you remember the waves crashing on the shore
Do you remember those days by the swimming pool
Do you remember, we would walk and you held my hand
