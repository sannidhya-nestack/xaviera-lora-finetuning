Mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Can I hold you once more, once more?
Can I touch you once more, once more?
Can I taste your lips with my fingertips?
Can I, can I taste your lips?
I will love you
Always, always, and I will be with you
Always, always, can I tell you once more?
Oh just one more time how you've changed me
How your love has made me someone better than I was before
I'm who I want to be
I'm where I wanna be with you
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna be
And I will love you always, always
And I will be with you always, always
There's so much that I long to say
But nothing that I have to say
Compares with what I'm about to say
To you, love
To you, my love
I will love you
Always, always, oh
And I will be with you always
You've got my heart in your hand and I will
Oh, I'm gonna love you
Always, oh, no matter where you go
Or what you become, I will love you always
And no matter what you do
Or what you say, I will love you always, always, always
Always, I will love you always
Oh, there's never been anyone else like you before
