Yeah yeah yeah yeah
To be with you again is the one thing I dream of
For a moment I thought that day was here
But you passed me by
Like I wasn't even there
So today I'll pretend that my dreams are real
Maybe my dreams are left
Tomorrow
Because right now they are dying
Sometimes it is hard to know when I am dreaming
But the difference between what is real is so small
So I pinch myself (pinch myself)
See if you're still there (you're still there)
And you are, but you're still not with me
Like I dreamed
Maybe my dreams will live tomorrow
Because right now they are dying
Maybe my dreams are there tomorrow
Because right now they are dying
So I live my dreams
Making real the illusion
Believing you're here with me, though you're unreachable
And so I live my dreams
Making real the illusion
Believing you're here with me, though you're unreachable
Maybe my dreams will live tomorrow
Because right now they are dying
And maybe my dreams will live
Tomorrow because right now they are dying, dying
Baby my dreams will live tomorrow because right now they are dying
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow
My dreams will live
