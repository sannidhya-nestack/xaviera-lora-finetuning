Her name whispered soft in your sleep
Says two now are three
In your heart there's a love burning deep
But not for me
All my love to you
I'm giving it everyday (all my love to you)
I'm throwing it all away (all my love to you)
Giving it everyday
Giving all my love to you
Your passion you try to disguise
Come closer you say
But that far away look in your eyes
Gives you away
All my love to you
I'm giving it everything
All my love to you
I'm throwing it all away
All my love to you
Giving it everyday
Giving all my love to you
Why can't you understand
My heart is in your hands oh no
Tomorrow will never undo
This pain in my heart
Guess I'll always be a fool for you
Like I've been from the start
All my love to you
I'm giving it everything
All my love to you
I'm throwing it all away (all my love to you)
You, I'm giving it every day
Giving all my love to you
All my love to you
All my love, giving all my love to you
All my love, giving all my love to you
All my love, giving all my love to you
All my love to you
