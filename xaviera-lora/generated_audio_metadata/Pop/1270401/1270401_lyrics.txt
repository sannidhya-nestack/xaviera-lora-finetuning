In the long days of dark and deep, I'll see your fantasy
Sparkling like a dream, where my love might be
Lost in the crowd we sway, music takes us away
No words left to say
Dance until light of day
Guessing you'll stop
So close yet so far
You shine without a scar
Though you are
Eyes that never lie
Glance up at the sky
Constellations fly
In your arms I'll try
Heartbeat echoing clear
Holding on when you're near
Whisper in my ear
Our wish will appear
Guessing your start
So close yet so far
You shine without a scar
To know you are
But lost in the crowd we sway
Use it takes us away
No words left to say
Dance until light of day
Guessing you'll stop
So close yet so far
You shine without a scar
Who you are
Who you are
Who you are
