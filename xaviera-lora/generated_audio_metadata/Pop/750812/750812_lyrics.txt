Everywhere I see your eyes shining on me
Your love stretching out a path for me
Everywhere I feel your smile lingering on me
Your grace covering me
Every flower, every breath, every tree, every life for me
Everywhere around me
Everything around me
Every flower, every breath, every trail, every light
Everywhere I look I see your face
Everywhere I turn, reflections of you
Every sound is music from your mind
The sunlight is your warmth around me
Everywhere around me
Everything around me
Every flower, every breath, every tree, every light
Everywhere around me
Everything around me
Every flower, every breath, every tree, every light
Without you, I can't breathe
Without you, I can't be
Without you, there's nothing
Without you, there's no me
Everywhere around me
Everything around me
Every flower, every breath, every tree, every light
Everywhere
Everything around me
Every flower, every breath, every tree, every light
