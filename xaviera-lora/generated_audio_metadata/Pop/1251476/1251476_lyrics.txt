Sunshine in the morning
Coffee cup then yawning
Every day is new
When I'm with you
Dancing in the sunlight
Never a dark night
Smiling through and through
All because of you
Loving you this light
A sunny day's delight
Every moment feels so right
Oh loving you is like
Walking in a rainbow
Feelings that just overflow
Every color bright in your light
Butterflies in dreams
Laughter in our scene
Holding you so tight feels so right
Loving you is like
A sunny day's delight
Every moment feels so right
Oh, loving you is like
Butterflies in dreams
Laughter in our seams
Holding you so tight, feels so right, mmm
Loving you is like a sunny day's delight
Every moment feels so right, oh
Loving you is like, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
