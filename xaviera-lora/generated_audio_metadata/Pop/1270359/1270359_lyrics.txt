In the sky so high above
Dreams and clouds all full of love
Violet flowers in the breeze
Whisper secrets through the trees
Twilight comes with purple hue
Stars come out the night feels new
Mystery in every shade
Magic moments gently made
What is violated
I wanna know
Colors dancing
Lights that glow
What is violated
Show me now
In the night, I'll take a bow
Brandy skies at end of day
Dreams like clouds all full of love
Violet flowers in the breeze
Whisper secrets through the trees
Twilight comes with double hue
Stars come out, the night feels new
Mystery in every shade
Magic moments, jelly trees
Twilight comes with double hue
Stars come out, the night feels new
Stars come out, the night feels new
Twilight comes with purple hue
Stars come out, the night feels new
Mystery in every shade
Magic moments, charming day
Twilight comes with purple hue
Stars come out, the night feels new
Mystery in every shade
Magic moments, charming day
Magic moments, charming day
What is the light?
I wanna know
Colors dancing
Lights that glow
What is violet? Show me now
In the night I'll take a bow
What is violet? I wanna know
Colours dancing, lights that glow
What is violet? Show me now
In the night I'll take a bow
Candy skies at end of day
Sunset paints the world that way
Lavender and lilac too
Every hue is something new
In a dream where colors swarm
Violet takes me for a twirl
Fantasy in every tone
Violet moments all my own
When you see it, feel the vibe
In the air, a quiet chime
Shades of violet, calm and true
All this magic just for you
