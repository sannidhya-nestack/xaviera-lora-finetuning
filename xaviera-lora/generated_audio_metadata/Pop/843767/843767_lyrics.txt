S-M-I-T, can't deny the chemistry I'm smitten, I'm smitten
S-M-I-T, we got some telepathy I'm smitten, I'm smitten
Run through sprinklers, ride down water slides
Summer nights, catching fireflies, love bugs bitten
I am smitten
I may never win the lottery
If I win your heart, that's enough for me
That's my mission
I am smitten
With you, boy, it's true, I feel free
Something'bout the broken in you
Speaks to the broken in me
You put my pieces back again
Just where love begins or ends, I'm not certain
But I am smitten
Love bugs bitten, yeah
I am smitten (I am smitten)
Can't deny the chemistry, I'm smitten (I'm smitten)
Smit, we got some to live with me, I'm smitten (I'm smitten, ooh)
You may not figure out where you belong
Even when you sing, you get the words all wrong
All's iven
I am smitten
Words don't do justice to the way I feel
Or fix the things that time will steal of bugs bitten
I am smitten
Friends say they don't see
What I see in you
Doesn't matter what they see
baby I do
People say you're pretty strange
Maybe you are and maybe you ain't
But you're pretty something
And I am smitten
Love, love's bitten
I am spittin' (S-M-I-T, can't deny the chemistry, I'm spittin' (spittin') (spittin') (spittin')
S-M-I-T, we got somethin' to let me feel, I'm spittin' (spitting) (spittin') (spittin')
S-M-I-T, you must be from Tennessee or Switans (Tennessee or Switans)
S-M-I-T, you're the only Tennessee or Switans (Tennessee or Switans)
