I feel the dawn of what's to be
I feel my heart, I skip a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I see my life pass me by
I look at you dead between the eyes
Did you do this to me?
Did I do this to myself?
Let's say this stupid game
You're on to blame for this cold-blooded game
Or am I to blame?
I let you stay
I gave a name to your cold-blooded game
I feel the dawn of what's to be, I feel like I'm a lost and see
I can't believe what you have done
I turned my back on what was mine, to you this was justified
Just a pawn in your game
You fell alive when I'm about to die
You stall and keep stealing me now
It was all in vain
All insane, this stupid game
You're out to blame for this cold-blooded game
Or am I to blame? I let you stay
I gave a name to your cold-blooded game
The countdown's starting, it's one, two, three, one, two, three, four
The countdown's starting to open, to walk out that door
Or I won't survive
I'm not here to tell your lies
You better open your eyes
This is my time
All insane, this stupid game
You're all to blame for this cold-blooded game
Or am I to blame? I let you stay
I gave my name to your cold-blooded game
It's a competitive game, it's a competitive game, it's love
