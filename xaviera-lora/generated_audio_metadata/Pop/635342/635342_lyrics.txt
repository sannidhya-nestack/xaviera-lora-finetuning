Won't you be mine, won't you be mine
Won't you be mine, won't you be mine
It never sets in the summertime
Making waves with the love that binds
The world can't see, subtle love I find
Breaking down so hard I try
Won't you be mine
Won't you be mine
Won't you be mine
Won't you be mine?
I'll never regret summer love is blind
Until you see that my heart is right
Giving you more hours passing by
In this fight so hard I tried
Won't you be mine
Won't you be mine
Won't you be mine
Won't you be mine?
This never sets in the summertime
Making waves with the love that binds
The world can't see, subtle love I find
Breaking down so hard I try
Won't you be mine?
Won't you be mine?
Won't you be mine?
Won't you be mine
Won't you be mine?
Won't you be mine?
Won't you be mine?
Won't you be mine?
