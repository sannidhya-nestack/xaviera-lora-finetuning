City lights below me as we soar up high
Touching dreams and catching stars in the endless sky
Clouds are dancing close now, they whisper your name
In this fleeting moment everything's the same
Window seat takes me far to where the heart belongs
Journey on with open eyes, singing silent songs
Sunrise paints the morning with a golden hue
Colors weave a tapestry of our skies in view
Up above the worries fade, troubles left behind
In this world of endless blue, peace is what we find
Landing lights are close, a city waking up
Memories and dreams we shared, filling up our cups
Window seat takes me far to where the heart belongs
Journey on with open eyes, singing silent songs
Sunrise paints the morning with a golden hue
Colors weave a tapestry of our skies in view
Sunrise paints the morning with a golden hue
Colors weave a tapestry of our skies in view
