Baby, you're lying to me again
Baby, baby, you're lying'bout everything
Don't you know I can't trust a word you say?
Yeah, baby, you're throwing it all away
Baby, you're lying to me again
Baby, baby, you're lying'bout where you've been
Don't you know I can't trust a word you say
Yeah, baby, you're throwing our love away
Throwing our love away
You're going out on me
Breaking all of the promises you didn't mean
Then you come crawling back to see
If I didn't even notice you were gone
You're going out on me
And I've tried to ive and pretend I didn't see
But there's no going back
When you won't even own what you've done
Baby you're lying to me again
Baby baby you're lying about everything
Don't you know I can't trust a word you say
Yeah baby you're throwing it all away
Baby, you're lying to me again
Baby, baby, you're lying'bout where you've been
Don't you know I can't trust a word you say
Yeah, baby, you're throwing our love away
Throwing our love away
I gave you everything I got
I was hot, loved you a lot
Was patient, thoughtful, and kind
Like I was taught, never fought
you got caught
But you got some endless need inside
You keep trying to hide it's taking you for a ride
Taking over your life, I'll never be your wife
It's like you got a big hole in your soul
You can't fill a need you keep trying to feed
But you don't need me, get some therapy
You'll have to find somebody else
Who doesn't care about herself
But I got too much going on
So it's time that you
Yeah, you'll have to find somebody new
Who's even more messed up than you
I've got a lot more self-respect
Than back when we first met
Baby you're lying to me again
Baby baby you're lying'bout everything
Don't you know I can't trust a word you say
Yeah baby you're throwing it all away
Baby you're lying to me again
Baby baby you're lying'bout where you've been
Don't you know I can't trust a word you say
Yeah baby you're throwing our love away
Throwing our love away
