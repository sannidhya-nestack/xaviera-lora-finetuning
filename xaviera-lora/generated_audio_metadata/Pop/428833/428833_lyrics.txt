Need to fly away, get out this city
Gotta find me in a place the sun shines on me
Girls bronzing the sands
Maybe someone in my hands
I should be there
I'm winter blue
The grey and the wind cuts through
And I need something new
The cold and the rain can't use
I'm down on myself
Guess I got the real winter blues
High above the sky the jets fly by me
All it takes to be up there is just some money
Girls bronzing the sands
Maybe someone in my hands
Far away there
I'm winter blue
The grey and the wind cuts through
And I need something new
The cold and the rain can't use
I'm down on myself
Guess I got the real winter blues
Know the streets as far as means will take me
Somewhere far away the sun could find me
Girls bronzing the sands
No more winter on my hands
I should be there
I'm winter blue
The grey of the wind cuts through
And I need something new
The cold and the rain can't choose
Oh I'm winter blue (winter blue)
The grey and the wind cuts through
And I need something new (something new)
The cold and the rain can't choose
I'm down on myself
Guess I got the real winter blues
I need somewhere else, got only this feeling to lose
I'm down on myself, guess I got the real winter blues
