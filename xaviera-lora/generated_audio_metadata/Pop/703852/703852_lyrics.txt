You are my desire
To rise above the sky
And touch down to them
Give'em something to hold on to
Give'em something to hold on to
No matter where I go
No matter what I do
No matter what road it always leads to you
Smoky days and restless nights
It's all I need to spark the fire in your eyes
In your eyes
Turn your world to light
As we find our way back home
Let us seek what must be found
But tell me where do we go? Where do we go from here? From here?
Yeah, I'm feeling alive when the music is on
The world would teach me to die but it's too soon to be gone
So I choose to be strong
But as the hate is seeping inside it's the use of a song
That keeps the truth alive to prove my mind would never do me wrong
Truly lost to forever be great
So together we say never the date
Will we turn away from the heavenly gates
It better escape the troubles that our affection creates
Since destiny waits for me to stumble
I'm humble but I'm asking this as a test of my faith
This mess that I face has a weird way of working itself
Encouraged to help him this dark world is burning in hell
Finding success means learning to fail
Feeling brain dead working my cells
My life's behind bars words from a jail
Breaking out letting the built up emotion free
Hopelessly stuck in this box the rhythm holds the key
Now that my spirit chose to see the holy ghost in me
I'm sweeping up the shattered wishes of these broken dreams
Turn your world
As we find our way back home
Let us seek what must be found
But tell me where do we go, where do we go from here?
As we drift and slip into a luminous world that fades, you'll fade
A battleground of love engraved with names
Gather round and watch them tame your flame
We don't wish to go, so we fly above
Over this war and sea we're lost
Sail the skies, stay brave and wise
Until our hearts are one
Turn your world to light (turn the world to light)
As we find our way back home (way back home)
Let us seek what must be found
But tell me where do we go, where do we go from here? (Where do we go from here?)
Turn your world to light
As we find our way back home
Let us seek what must be found
But tell me where do we go, where do we go from here, from here?
