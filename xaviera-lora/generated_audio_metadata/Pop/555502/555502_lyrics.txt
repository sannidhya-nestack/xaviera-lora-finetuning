I'm falling in between a sea of stars
Feeling convicted by invisible chains
Your shallow shades of grey paint up my heart
They left me blinded and in disarray
you reigned over me, stalling love or war
And watered down my silent hurting and pain
Now love is in reverse the whole damn nine yards
The love you took didn't equal the love you made
And it doesn't seem to change your ways
My love is in reverse I'm taking back my days
Don't seem to care that I've been loving in vain
This all left on my skin is gonna fade
I'll wage a civil war (oh)
And be the bird of prey who'll chase you away
A phoenix born from flames (oh)
I'll be making, making your day
You said I was worth the wait
Guess I fell out of grace
And I've been trapped in your mind filled with pain
Throw more ego on phrase
I'm walking, walking away
Love in reverse is just here to stay
It's here to stay
You had to wear my soul, took care with both hands
I surrendered everything I used to own
You needed more control, my heart was banned
Now I'm done being your stepping stone
And it doesn't seem to change your ways
My love is in reverse, I'm taking back my days
Don't seem to care that I've been loving in vain
The salt left on my skin is gonna fade
I'll wage a civil war, oh
And be the bird of prey who'll chase you away
A phoenix born from flames, oh
I'll be making, making your day
You said I was worth the wait
Guess I fell out of grace
And I've been trapped in your mind filled with pain
No more ego on space
Cause I'm walking, walking away
Love in reverse is just here to stay
It was as good as love can get
You had to waste it, waste it away
With my eyes on fire, I fear no regret
I won't be missing your plate to stay
Free falling in between a sea of stars
No more conviction by invisible chain
Now love is in reverse to hold them nine yards
The love you took didn't equal the love you made
I'll wage a civil war
And be the bird of prey who'll chase you away
A phoenix born from flames, oh
I'll be making, making your day
You said I was worth the wait, guess I fell out of grace
And I've been trapped in your minefield of pain
No more either one phrase
I'm walking, walking away
Loving reverse is just here to stay
