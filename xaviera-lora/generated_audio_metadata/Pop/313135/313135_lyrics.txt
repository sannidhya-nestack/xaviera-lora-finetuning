Mew, mew, mew, mew
Funky, funky, funky cow
Everybody wants to know how
Mew, mew
Up in here, down the stair
Everybody knows it's a funky cow
Said funky cow, funky cow
Welcome to funky town
Funky cows make Coca-Cola
And everybody is a sober, alright
It's a cow town, it's a cow town
No chickens allowed
Meow, meow, meow, meow
Funky, funky, funky cow (cow, cow, cow, cow)
Funky, funky, funky cow (cow cow cow cow)
Where the cows make Coca-Cola
And everybody is a sober
Mew, mew
Up in the air, down the stair
Everybody know it's a funky cow
Said funky cow, funky cow
Welcome to funky town
Find a cow, find a cow, find a cow
Find a cow, find a cow, find a cow
Find a cow, find a cow, find a cows
Find a cow, find a cow, find a Cow
