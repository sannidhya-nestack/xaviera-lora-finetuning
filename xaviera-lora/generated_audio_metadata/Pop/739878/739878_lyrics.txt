Come together when the working day is done
Come together people celebrate
Bring together to connect is what we want
Come together and elevate
Come together like a family here to stay
Come together people let's create
Bring together not tomorrow but today
Come together it just feels great
Woo yeah
Reach out to anyone of all the walks of life
Feel good, the limit is the sky
Reach out to anyone of all the sorts and size
Enjoy, it makes you feel alive
Woo, yeah
Come together people dare to join the ride
Come together on this brand new day
Bring together everyone's a superstar
Come together just to celebrate
Make me feel like singing
Make me feel like singing
Make me feel like singing

Make me feel like singing (ooh yeah)
Make me feel like singing (come on)
Make me feel like singing (yeah)
Make me feel like singing (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, reach out to anyone of all the walks of life
Feel good, pull the limit, it's the sky, oh yeah
Reach out to anyone of all the sorts inside
Enjoy, it makes you feel alive (make you feel like singing)
Make me feel like singing, make me feel like singing, make me feel like, make me feel like, make me feel like singing, make me feel like singing, make me feel like, make me feel like singing
