Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ten o'clock on a cloudy night
I see a pretty woman who needs a light
She's a woman in a sexy way
She's making me et all the words I had to say
Kinda wonder does she need a ride
Since I'm heading to the house and it's on the night
So I asked and she said alright
And I knew that right away I had it going on tonight
I know she wants everybody to be looking at her like a bomb
She is no doubt every woman every man would ever have a dream about
Oh baby can't you see the crazy things that she do to me
Oh baby can't you see you're what I need
You know I like it
You know I want it
You know I need it
Baby can't you see what you do to me
You know I like it
You know I want it
You know I love it
Baby can't you see what you do to me
Making me so nervous I can barely walk
Barely move, barely talk
See this never really happened to me
I'm not used to this, living fantasy
I know she sees when a man is feeling quite a little weak in the knees
She knows, no doubt she's a woman any man would have a dream about
Oh baby can't you see the crazy things that she threw to me
Oh baby can't you see you're what I need
I like it, you know I want it
You know I need it
Baby can't you see what you do to me
You know I like it, you know I want it
You know I love it
Baby can't you see what you do to me
Hey baby, let me tell you something
You're the cutest baby waiting to dance
And you're feeling the vibe, I see you taking a chance
I never felt a woman make me so weak
Something kinda like what you're doing to me
Got loads of cash that I'm willing to blow
I'm a beauty queen, that's you my love
I'm also sweet if you just give me a chance
So shake your hips, make your body dance
I like it, you know I want it, you know I need it
Baby can't you see what you do to me?
You know I like it, you know I want it, you know I love it
Baby can't you see what you do to me
