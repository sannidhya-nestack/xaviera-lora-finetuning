There are days I just want to breathe
Is that too much to ask for some relief?
Take a rest, relieve the stress, clear my mind
This world is getting heavy on my shoulders
Heated arguments are leaving me colder
Can't you see
All I really need is just to be
Take a walk in the park, let the dog bark
Watch an old movie on TV
Chill out in a warm blanket
With a bowl of chocolate chip ice cream
Nothing to do, just be
My guitar has rusty strings
Once upon a time I'd play and sing
Now it's a chore, wish I had more time to kill
This world is getting so heavy on my shoulders
Heated arguments are leaving me colder
Can't you see?
All I really need is just to be
Take a walk in the park, let the dog bark
Watch an old movie on TV
Chill out in a warm blanket
With a bowl of chocolate chip ice cream
Nothing to do, just be
Sands of time are flowing down, one day I won't be around
Days go by, I lose track, I wish that I could get them back
Take a walk in the park at the dark bar
Watch an old movie on TV
Chill out in a warm blanket
With a bowl of chocolate chip ice cream
Nothing to do, just be
Just be, just be
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
