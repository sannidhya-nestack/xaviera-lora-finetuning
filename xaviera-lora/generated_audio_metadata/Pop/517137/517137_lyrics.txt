She's always been true
But sometimes from a different angle
Keeping track of her instincts
Even on her own last travel
A misfit any place or time
An outcast trying to tell the lie
That she was to rue
Like believing in Jesus
Through the darkest hour
Stripped of all her possessions
Lose in touch with that sacred power
Like Job when he could get no worse
Even when he thought he was cursed
He stayed true
Beauty breaks through the storm
Like a rose through decaying rose
And everything she's ever known
Is worth nothing, nothing without a home
Always fighting temptation
To settle for some heaven
A little piece of easy, oh no
Taste of that easy living
Closer yet she turns away
She's gotta pay to stay true
