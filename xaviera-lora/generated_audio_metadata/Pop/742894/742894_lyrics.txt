Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Whisper in silence
Secrets no one discovers
Relinquish your sorrow
Abandon all your mistakes
Run away, child, leave it all behind
Now I can see your halo in the night
Follow fate, now we will never break down
Walking on our own ground in this life
Run away now
Run away now
Run away now
Run away now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Walking through shadows
Break down all of these walls
Conquer your battles
Exhale the poison inside
Run away, child, leave it all behind
Now I could see your halo in the night
Follow fate, now we will never break down
Walking on our own ground in this life
Run away now
Run away now, run away now, run away now, run away now
Find your own heartbeat
Wash away the pain
Find your own heartbeat
Take it all
Run away now, run away now
Run away now, run away now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Run away now
Run away
Run away now
Run away now
Run away now
