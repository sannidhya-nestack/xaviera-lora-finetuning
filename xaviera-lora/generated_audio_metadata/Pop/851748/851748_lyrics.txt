Mother taught me how to fish with my bare hands
Whilst brother chops the wood in the square
My father builds the ships from the forest lowland
The fire burns high up in the air
I'm just waiting for the day when great Odin says "No"
He says "Valhalla's not the place for you"
And when Freya walks my way and she stares into my soul
She says "Young lady, you've got work to do"
I'm made with bone and lost in love
I'm strong like stone but I move like a dove
I'm fast like dogs but I fight like the bear
When I go into her meadow you can meet me there
I will wear a cloak of burning feathers
Of fastest falcons they will be
My chariot is strong and it moves like rivers
No mountain top will try and stop me
Oh, I'm just waiting for the day when great Odin says, "No"
He says, "Valhalla is not the place for you"
And when Freya walks my way and she stares into my soul
She says, "Young lady, you've got work to do"
I'm made with bone and lust and love
I'm strong like stone but I move like a dove
I'm fast like dogs but I fight like the bear
When I go into her meadow you can meet me there
I'm just waiting for the day when great Odin says "No"
He says "Valhalla's not the place for you"
And when Freya walks my way and she stares into my soul
She says "Young lady, you've got work to do"
I'm made with bone and lust and love
I'm strong like stone but I move like a dove
I'm fast like dogs but I fight like the bear
When I go into her meadow you can meet me there
I'm made with bone and lost in love
I'm strong like stone but I move like a dove
I'm fast like dogs but I fight like the bear
When I go into her meadow you can meet me there
