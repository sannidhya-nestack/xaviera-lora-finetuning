I got a private thirst, just don't come unrehearsed
It gives me something to savor
My job's a bitter pill, everybody's got their thrills
But they're the dullest of flavors, ha!
All day I bite my tongue, the taste of blood is strong
You got me choking on Saviors
No, I don't wanna slice, ain't got no appetite
You don't know me
Oh my goodness
Got no love but the secret sweetness
Right from my candy cane
They getting such a spin, devour saccharine
And fall so hard that they break it
But I got no alibi, no little cutie pie
Who's gonna help me to fake it
my life's a joke, it's cold and I am broke now
But they can't see that one taste can bring me right round
Oh my goodness
Got no love but the secret sweetness
Right from my candy cane (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Don't mind the pouring rain (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Out of my candy cane (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Don't mind the pouring rain, I got my candy cane
Don't mind the pouring rain, I got my candy cane
Oh my goodness, got no love but the secret sweetness
Right from my candy cane
Oh my goodness
Got no love but the secret sweetness
Right from my candy cane
Tear down that fear this night
