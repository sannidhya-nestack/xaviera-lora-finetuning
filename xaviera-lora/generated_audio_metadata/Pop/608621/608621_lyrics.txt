Can I steal a moment of your time?
Could I lend you ears just for a song?
I know I am just a fool who sings
Songs are little importance to your heart
Moved at love you live alone
Yeah well I can't help you roll this stone
I just sing this song and time rolls by
I dream away and learn from life now
Brother brother brother brother
Where did you go?
I said where did you go?
Where did you go?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh.
We are on this journey you and I
We are both a little peculiar about who ain't
We gave up much knowing we are
So completely lost but also free now
Brother brother brother brother
Where are we now
Where are we now
Where are we now
And I keep a lot of wonderings inside
I, I learn that thoughts like these I have to hide
Now that I sit here alone on my own
I get patience to wait
Father, father, father, father
Why am I here?
Yeah, why am I here?
Say, why am I here?
