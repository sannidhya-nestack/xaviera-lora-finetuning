I came a long while
Saw all the change like from winter to spring
I couldn't hear it
Confused by the words
Oh going back and forth to the end
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
A child with a vision
Clear like the morning
Rise like the morning
All the changes
Go stop and go
Oh don't stop'til the edge of the world
Shield, let it down
If I see into your eyes
Fever dream, come to life
Do you feel it rising up
In your head and in your mind
Touch from the skyline
See the horizon
Feel the horizon
Where can you take it?
Time trip the break
Bring the light
Burn it out
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Shield, let it down
If I see into your eyes
Fever dream, come to life
Do you feel it rising up
In your head and in your mind
Shield, let it down
If I see into your eyes
Beaver dream, come to life
Do you feel it rising up
In your head and in your mind
Do you feel it rising?
Feel it rising
Feel it rising up
