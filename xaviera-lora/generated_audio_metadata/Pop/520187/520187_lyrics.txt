She waits till the ocean
From a box beside her bed
She pours herself coffee
Takes some pills to clear her head
She tries to remember
What she meant to do instead
Of being alone
With the weight of the world
On her shoulders
And she dreams that she can fly
And knows all the reasons why
With the lessons she's learned she'll get by
And she knows she's breaking soon
Through the walls of her cocoon
Spread your wings and fly
She packs up her children
Sends them off to start their day
Her greatest creations
These four lives that she has made
A great consolation
For the life that she had to trade
All of her plans
Sit in her box
On a shell
She dreams that she can fly
And knows all the reasons why
With the lessons she's learned she'll get by
And she knows she's breaking soon
Through the walls of her cocoon
Spread your wings and fly
Butterfly, oh, oh, oh, oh
Butterfly, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Flying
She's trying on colors
Picking wings so she can fly
She searches for answers
But they're all inside her mind
Is she dreams that she can fly
And knows all the reasons why
With the lessons she's learned she'll get by
And she knows she's breaking soon
Through the walls of her cocoon
Spread your wings and fly
