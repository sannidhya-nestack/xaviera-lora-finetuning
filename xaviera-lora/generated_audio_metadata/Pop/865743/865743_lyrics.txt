Don't overthink things, baby
I know that you do
You've been a stranger lately
And I know that's not you
Easy come, easy go
No need to fight about it
Easy come, easy go
No stress, I'm good without it
Easy come, easy go
Let's keep it fun and simple
Easy come, easy go
You know my lovin' is
No sweat, it's no sweat, mm-mm
It's no sweat, it's no sweat, mm-mm
It's no sweat, it's no sweat, mm-mm
It's no sweat, it's no sweat, mmm-mm
Don't overthink things, baby
I know that you do
You've been a stranger lately
And I know that's not you
Easy come, easy go
No need to fight about it
Easy come, easy go
No stress, I'm good without it
Easy come, easy go
Let's keep it fun and simple
Easy come, easy go
You know my lovin' is
It's no sweat, it's no sweat, mmm
It's no sweat, it's no sweat, mmm
It's no sweat, it's no sweat, mm-mm
It's no sweat, it's no sweat, mmm-mm
