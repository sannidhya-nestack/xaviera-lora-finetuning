In my dream I swear you looked at me
With a look in your eye said we could have been
But I looked down in disbelief
A thousand insecurities
Full of hope and broken dreams of you and me
And you were like, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just like, ooh, ooh, ooh
A year flew past just like another page
But as time goes by I guess things never change
I'm hit by all the memories
Of how things they used to be
I'm just lost in the hope of you and me
'Cause you were like, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just like, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Every time I open up my eyes to see
I can't believe you gave up what was meant to be
Now you know the way I feel
Will you turn to me and see what I see?
It's like ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mm-hmm
Just like ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh
It's like ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mm-hmm
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm
