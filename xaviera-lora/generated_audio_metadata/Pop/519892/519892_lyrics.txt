Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on my friend
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on my friend
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it my friend
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on my friend
When all is quiet on the western front
And you pretend you're feeling good
We laugh, we have another glass of wine
But you don't look into my eyes
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on my friend
Let me hear what it is, what it is you can't
Give up the need for having fun
Give up and show me who you are
Instead of skating let us melt the ice
You'll see the heat will make you strong
When all is quiet on the western front
But you don't look into my eyes
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on my friend
Let me hear what it is, what it is you can't
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on my friend
I will try, I will try to be there if I can
I will try, I will try to be there if I can
