I hear you callin' out from the darkness (callin' out from the darkness)
I hear you callin' out from the darkness
I hear you callin' out from the darkness
I'm comin' back from the dead (let's go)
I need you (yup) but you already know that
You're picture perfect, Kodak
Every time I'm down and out I think about you and I feel better, Prozac
Look girl, I don't need a whole lot in this world as long as I got you
my lungs don't work without you, it's true
Bring me back to life
My heart needs you to be
Save me from the light
Don't let me fly a line
Don't let me fly a line
Don't let me fly a line
Don't let me fly a line
Don't let me fly away (Here we go)
You brought me back to life (Yeah, yeah)
Frankenstein, you energized me
I just keep going on and on
Alkaline (Woo)
I feel untouchable
On top of the world when I got you
My heart don't work without you, it's true
I need you to breathe
Bring me back to life
My heart needs you to be
Save me from the light
Don't let me fly away
Don't let me fly away
Don't let me fly away
Don't let me fly away
Don't let me fly a line
I hear you calling out from the darkness
I'm coming back from the dead
I hear you calling out from the darkness
I'm coming back from the dead
I need you to breathe (I need you to breathe)
I need you to breathe (I need you to breath)
I need you to breathe
Bring me back to life
My heart needs you to beat, oh
Save me from the night
Don't let me flatline
Don't let me flatline
Don't let me flatline
Don't let me flatline
Don't let me flatline
