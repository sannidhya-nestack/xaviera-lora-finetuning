This could be good for me
Lately I was feeling like I need a purpose
But when you talk to me
Give me the impression that I won't scratch your surface
And I could walk for days
Searching for your praise
But is it even there to find
Is there a chance for me
To clean your memories
Will I slowly lose my mind
Lost in your maze
Stuck in your gaze
How can I get out
I'm out of time
To make you mine
Baby show me how
This could be good for me
Lately I was feeling like I need a purpose
But when you talk to me
Give me the impression that I won't scratch your surface
And I could walk for days
Searching for your place
But is it even there to find?
Is there a chance for me
To clean your memories?
Will I slowly lose my mind?
Lost in your maze
Stuck in your gaze
How can I get out?
I'm out of time to make you mine
Baby show me how
