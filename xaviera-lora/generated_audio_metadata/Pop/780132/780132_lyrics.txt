I'm so rational but you're making me crazy
You've got my judgement all damn hazy
I'm gonna raise hell, swallow this pride
TKL! TKL!
I'm so serious, which got me made delirious
Love with a song, keep it moving on
Taking it off, my skin is on fire
TKL!
I got my feet down on the ground
But now you've turned me inside out
Now that my head's caught in the clouds
Don't ever want to come back down
You're not here with your one, two, twos
With your tipsy shots coming on my
Got me up, got me down, turn me all around
Gotta know that your love is all for me
Your love is all for me
Your offbeat charms got you wearing the crown
Your slick black hair keep on turning me out
Got that buzz now follow your lead
T .K .L. T .K .L.
Your sucks your punch got my head in a daze
Your charming ways I will never complain
Let's go we're gonna run this town tonight
T .K .L. T .K .L.
I've got my feet down on the ground
But now you've turned me inside out
Now that my head's caught in the clouds
Don't ever want to come back down
You knocked me up with your one, two, two, three, oh
With your GF T-shirts, got me on the floor
Got me up, got me down, turned me all around
Gotta know that your love is all for me
Your love is all for me
I am losing my control
Come to me now
Come on I just want some more
What are you waiting for
You knock me out with your one, two, two, three (one, two, three, yeah)
With your TNT shots (shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots)
Yum me up
Yum me down
Turn me all around
Gotta know that your love is all for me
Your love is all for me
