Switch left to right
You keep flipping
You change your mind
You change your mind
No can't be that hard
This decision is black and white
It's black and white
Girl make up your mind
You're the kinda girl who's always right
Day and night
I'm done sitting tight
I'm looking for a girl who doesn't fight
Every night and it's like
You come and go (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm through with this side show (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I never know (whoa, whoa, whoa)
You walk the line too slow
Switch switch left to right
Left left right
Switch switch left to right
Left left right
Girl everyday when I wake up I'm in a dream
It's like a movie scene stuck on repeat how can it be
I can't seem to find why you're always a step behind every time
I tried, sitting tight
I'm looking for a girl who doesn't fight every night
And it's like, you come and go
I'm through with this sideshow
I never know, you walk the line too slow
Come on now
Woah oh
You come and go
Woah oh
Woah oh
I'm through with this side show
Woah oh
I never know
Woah oh
You walk the line too slow
