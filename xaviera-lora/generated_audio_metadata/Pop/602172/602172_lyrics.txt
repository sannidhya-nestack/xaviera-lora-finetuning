Butox babies trying hard to fit in
Searching for beauty in a jar
Pills and scalpels dying to be thin
So they'll look like their favorite star
But they won't find it this way
love's what makes you beautiful
That's the way it's always been
So if you want to look incredible
Just remember, always start within
love makes you beautiful
Airbrushed models, eous by birth
But perfection only goes skin deep
Use an appearance to measure self worth
Magazines and films breed fantasy
If they'd only look inside
love's what makes you beautiful
That's the way it's always been
So if you want to look incredible
Just remember, always start within
love makes you beautiful
Just think about what God gave you
True beauty comes from the light inside of you
love's what makes you beautiful
That's the way it's always been
So if you want to look incredible
Just remember, always start within
love makes you beautiful
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
