Didn't do it to impress, did it to feel good
And if you dropped your jaw, well that's just real cool
So pass the bottle now, cause I'ma celebrate
I didn't bake the cake, but I'ma say I ate
Cause I'ma crush it, yeah baby real slow
Yeah I'ma grind it, I'm gonna change the flow
Life is moving way too fast
And I got a lot to do, so get out my ear
Get out my ear, so get out my ear
Yeah, I made it look easy
And all I need is one shot
Because I do it like this
Yeah, I made it look easy
And all I need is one shot
Because I do it like this

'Cause I make it happen now, they know me as the man
Yeah, I'ma eatin' good, don't even touch a can
Got fans around the world, our strangers know my name
We party everywhere, we doped up on the fame

Life is moving way too fast
And I got a lot to do
So listen here

And when we do it, we do it quickly
Check it, huh
Magic to your eyes, what's a big surprise? You watch my sparks fly, wanna hear me out?
Living like there's no tomorrow, and you know I rule
Cause I'm a leader I don't follow
That's the way it is, when we do this
We take it all the way, cause there's no other day
And this is all we got, hey, yeah
Yeah, I made it look easy
And all I need is one shot
Because I do it like this
Yeah, I made it look easy
And all I need is one shot
Because I do it like this
