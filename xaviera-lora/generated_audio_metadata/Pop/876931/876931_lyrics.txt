There was a time in history
Your next meal was a mystery
If you were lucky you might catch a fish
But we have Amazon now
No need for brains or brawn now
You're wishlist to your door in
Just one click
Pointless productivity
I sit behind a screen
My fingers span the inches in a place of inactivity
For hours every day
Relentless innovation requires concentration
To thrive in this knowledge economy
My digital creations have no physical manifestation
I deal in intellectual property
Pointless productivity
I sit behind a screen
My fingers span the inches in a blaze of inactivity
Captivity for hours every day
I dare to call it work
Our avatars in silhouette
Addicted to the internet
We type and type but never sweat
But never sweat
Our bellies stuffed
Perpetually
Defining sloth
And gluttony
We die too soon
But live like kings
For now let's just enjoy it
No reason to avoid it
Who needs an extra gear to
Coast downhill
So come my couch potato, adopt my humble credo
And watch the world revolve while we sit still
Pointless productivity
I sit behind a screen
My fingers span the inches in a blaze of inactivity
Captivity for hours every day
I dare to call it pointless
I sit behind a screen
My fingers bend the inches in a blaze of inactivity
Captivity for hours every day
I dare to call it work
Pointless productivity
I sit behind a screen
My fingers span the inches in a blaze of inactivity
Creativity
I exercise my mind
And laugh to call it work
