I pull the collar up against my neck
See you here in every breath
Showing me a warmer place to be
Well, I've been walking for a lifetime
And with all the things I've seen
You're still the one I'm after
When I'm following my dreams
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I may be gone a little while
But I'll always come back to you
And even when my thoughts are running wild
They'll always come back to you
So keep a fire burnin' and keep the faith, my darlin'
And keep an eye out for some kinda sign
when I finish all this business, then with God as my witness
You'll get what you've been wishin' for
And you'll get it right on time
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, I may be gone a little while
But I'll always come back to you
And even when my thoughts are running wild
They always come back to you
And you know it's coming true
I'll always come back to you
When that lonesome whistle blows
And my soul is wearing thin
These old walking shoes
Always know the way back to you
I may be gone a little while but I'll always come back to you
And even when my thoughts are running wild they always come back to you
And you know it's coming true
I'll always come back to you, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Back to you, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Back to you
Back to you, back to you
