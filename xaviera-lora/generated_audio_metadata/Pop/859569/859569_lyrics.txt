It's a good day, it's a good life
But you're walking around with your head down
It's a good life, it's a good day
Get ready to go and you'll be on your way
Better let go, make it slow, delay the odds
Say it again, do it with everything and you'll be on your way
Go have fun, don't be scared, just live a little
Feel your heart flame burn when you live a little
Live a little
It's a good year, when you shout out
Stay ahead, they're stuck in a grey cloud
When you shout out, it's a good year
Get ready to go and you'll be on your way
Better let go, negative flow, be loud of yours
You know it's a good life
Say it again, do it and win everything
And you'll be on your way
Don't go waste that
Be on your way
You know it's a good life, so don't go waste that
Feel your heart flame burn when you live a little
Go have fun, don't be scared, just live a little, live a little
It's a good good day
You know it's a good life so don't go waste it
Stop a second cause I know you can taste it
Tell me what you wanna do and then we gonna
Make it happen cause nothing can replace it
Don't need no million to have a have a good time
All that you need is some fun to have a good life
Summer party move your body
Shake it shake it to the beat everybody
It's a good day it's a good life
Watch you walking around with your head down
It's a good life it's a good day
Get ready to go and you'll be on your way
Better let go
Make it a song, feel it at your heart
Say it again, do it and win everything and you'll be on your way
Be on your way
Don't need my millions to have a have a good time
Bit a little, negative flow, be out of your, oh oh oh oh
Sun my body, move your body
Shake it, shake it to the beat everybody
Go have fun, don't be scared, just live a little
Go have fun, don't be scared, just live a little
Go have fun, don't be scared, just live a little
Live a little
