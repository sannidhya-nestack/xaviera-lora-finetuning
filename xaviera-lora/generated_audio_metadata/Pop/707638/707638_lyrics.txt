One last talk is, is all that I can do
I got no writing still left for you
No more blank pages left to write on
I keep on circling back to you
night after night after night
We're fighting, we got nothing left to do
And I draw a line that I won't step over
I don't need you there, babe
And I'll be loving you for the last time
I'm giving up tonight, I'll be gone
I won't stay to fight, I won't even try
This we can't rewrite, I'll be gone
So listen, do you remember when we talked on the phone late at night
I just knew that you weren't alone
But at the same time I was gone hanging loose with a girl that I knew from before
We already knew all we know now, I just drew faster in our Mexican stand up
Cause I don't want you dead bad
And I'll be loving you for the last time
I've given up tonight, I'll be gone
I won't stay to fight, I won't even try
This we can't rewrite, I'll be gone
And I'll be loving you for the last time
I'm giving up tonight, I'll be gone
I won't stay to fight, I won't even try
This weekend we ride, I'll be gone
And I'll be loving you
For the last time, I'm giving up tonight, I'll be gone
I won't stay to fight, I won't even try
This we can't rewrite, I'll be gone
