I was seventeen and he was two
The best of friends we made it through together
Whatever came our way
He saw me cry but he made me laugh
Probably did things we shouldn't have
But I'd never take them back
Sitting here missing him, wondering how he's been since then
Sometimes he'll cross my mind, takes me back to that time and I wonder if
What if we kept our promises? What if we never did et?
What if we meant all the beautiful things we said?
And what if he made me, made me stay? And he was still mine today?
What if we could ive and re-begin? And be seventeen again?
We'd sit by the fire and kiss too long
Then he'd play guitar and I'd sing along
I swear the sound was magic to me
And I didn't care, we were all we had
Say I love you with the squeeze of my hand
Back before growing up be
And now I sit here missing him, wondering how he's been since then
Sometimes the old cross of mine takes me back to that time and I
What if we kept our promises?
What if we never did et?
What if we meant all the beautiful things we said?
And what if he made me, made me stay
And he was still mine today?
What if we could ive and re-begin
And be seventeen again?
I've never hurt and I've never loved again like that
If the first real love you have is actually the last
Then I can't help but ask
What if we'd kept our promises? What if we never did et?
What if we meant all the beautiful things we said?
And what if he made me, made me stay And he was still mine today?
What if we could ive and re-begin And be seventeen again?
Ah, ooh-ooh, mm
