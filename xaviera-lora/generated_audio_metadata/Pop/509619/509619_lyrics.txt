Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bamba
Ba-ba-ba
Whatever I had is gone
Whatever I thought was wrong
And I just keep stumbling on
The same old stones
I know when to hit the ground
When everything's falling down
But I just keep waiting round
And nothing is changing, it's always the same thing
And I just keep getting into situations
I just keep on retracing my steps
And my intuition keeps on telling me wrong
But I keep on standing still, I'm spinning, spinning
And you're just a fool like me
We play this game endlessly
But you know it's hard to free
A dog from its chain when it just wants to stay out of it
Getting into situations
We just keep on erasing our steps
And our intuition keeps on telling us
Remember we keep on standing still and spinning
Spinning, oh
Load your gun, it's off to war we go
The time has come, this is something that we both know
This is the part where we make the story end
We've got to fight until somebody wins
But we can't keep getting into situations (into situations)
We can't keep on retracing our steps
If our intuition keeps on telling us wrong
We can't keep standing still and spinning
Stealing
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
