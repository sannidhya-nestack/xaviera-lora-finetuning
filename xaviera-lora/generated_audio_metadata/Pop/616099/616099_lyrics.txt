City lights, don't mistake them from up above
And all I can see
Is this dream I've been dreaming of
I'll take my time
And I'll be just fine
Another day
Pushing past the crowd
Any other way
Gotta make them hear the sound
I'll take my time
And I'll be just fine, just fine
But I'm still gonna show my strength in my soul
I'd give all I've got if I ever have not
And even if I fall, I'll just get up and brush myself off
With nothing at all, I'm going all alone
This time
Different faces along the road
Dream chasing, don't let it go
I will give my time, oh
And I will be just fine, just fine
And I'm still gonna show my strength in my soul
I give all I've got if I have I have not
And even if I fall I'll just get up and brush myself off
With nothing at all I'm going all alone
This time
And we will meet again
And I will call you my friend
And there you will see
The me that I wanted to be (That's what you'll see)
But I'm still gonna show
My strength in my soul
I'd give all I've got
If I ever have none
And even if I fall
I'll just get up and brush myself off
With nothing at all
I'm going all alone
Yeah, this time, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
I'll be fine on my own
All alone, oh, this time
