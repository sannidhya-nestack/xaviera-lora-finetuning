Tired of being alone
Alone in the dark
Light my light again, the flame cannot be gone
I needed this girl, stay in my life, but I lost her
How can she not be the one for me
Not one for you
Oh, just dreamed that you
Put your arms around me
Oh, just dreamed that you
Put your arms around me
Now I'm weak
And now I'm lost
And now I cried and cried I
Have woken up
And why do I have
To write the words
That belong to this song
We could have been together
Forever we'll be holding on
Yeah, doesn't even matter
Doesn't even care
Just dream that you'll put your arms around me
Just dream that you'll put your arms around me
Around me
Around me
Around me
Around me
Just dream that you put your arms around me
Just dream that you put your arms around me
See the fields, flowers, birds up in the sky
When I dream of you
Let's fly away with me
There was a medicine for this hurt
I gave it to you
So once your heart is broken you won't get
What I'm going through
You won't get
What I'm going through
I love you
