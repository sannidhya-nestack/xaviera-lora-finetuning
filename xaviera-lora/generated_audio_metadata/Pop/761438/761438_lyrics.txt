Slowly he sang as I cried upon his shoulder
Oh and darling he said I think we're growing older
These dreams of ours, I think they're running faster away
Don't you think maybe they're just a tad of wasted
No one knows it
La da da da da da da
Slowly I turned'cause I knew he wasn't lying
Oh and darling I said my dreams they too are dying
Where did they run to? I don't recall an address
They just ran out the door, couldn't follow them
I was undressed
Where we going? No one knows it
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Let's run away and maybe life will follow
Oh and let's set off fire and burn down all that's left here
