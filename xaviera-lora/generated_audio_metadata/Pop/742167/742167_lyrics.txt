Work the week, roll one tight and blow
Ease the tension, got to let it go
Love how we play this game
Go hard got no shame
Older life can't give what we need
Two shots take the dive
Three shots feel alive
Save a kiss for me
Live it right see
Live it right
Fresh like Michael Knight
Feeling so good
Yeah, we're living right, now we up all night
Pass the crowd, sip it up, live it up, I suppose
Got your five pounds of fame, now you're into it knee deep
Back onto the stage,'cause you need it more
Got your five pounds of fame, break the cycle of repeat
Back onto the stage, yeah
Clutch the pine, veil the night away
A stoner is a loner either way
Dance on your church front porch
Making slains in your daddy's Porsche
All that life can give, but you need more
It tastes so good, getting nice on the Maybach hood
Save a shot for me, live it right, see, live it right
Fresh like Michael Knight, feeling so good
Yeah, we're living right, now we up all night
Pass the crowd, sip it up, live it up
I suppose, got you five pounds of fame
Now you're into an ED, back onto the stage
you need it more, got you five pounds of fame
Break the cycle, repeat, back onto the stage
I suppose, I suppose
Don't you feel the same
Pass the crown, sip it up, live it up, I suppose
Pass the crown, sip it up, live it up, I suppose
Pass the crown, sip it up, live it up, I suppose
Pass the crown, sip it up, live it up, I suppose
Pass the crown, sip it up (yeah)
Pass the crown, live it up (ooh)
Pass the crown
Sip it up (yeah)
Pass the crowd (woo)
And I suppose, I suppose
