We left my little umbrella in that tiny restaurant
And when it started pouring, you were all so nonchalant
And later on that evening, as we cuddled by the fire
When we're holding hands, I'm so free that I can fly
And when you look at me without looking your eyes
I just can't help but feel that life is oh so grand
Oh, it feels so good that it's hard to understand
Yes, it's magic and it's tragic yet emphatically true
I can't fall out of love with that imaginary you
And still I know that someday I'm certain
We will meet in that Italian restaurant
Or somewhere on the street
I love the way you tell me that I can do no wrong
And how you're always smiling when I write another song
And sometimes when I catch you with that alluring little smile
I dream that I am captured as we're walking down
Yes it's magic and it's tragic yet emphatically true
I can't fall out of love with that imaginary you
And still I know that someday I'm certain
We will meet in that Italian restaurant
Or somewhere on the street
I can't fall out of love with that imaginary you
