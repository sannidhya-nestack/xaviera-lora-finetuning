In the morning, boy, it feels so right
Thinking'bout you,'cause I stayed up all night
Wondering if you feel the way I do
It's so brand new
But oh, something don't feel right, don't say so
Rather be the last to know, don't be the last to know, oh
Feels like I'm caught in the crowd
And my guy's coming down
Along with my hair
Oh baby it's not fair
I'm trying to say no but it just comes
I'll dance, oh baby, you're driving me crazy
I'm caught in a scene from a Lady Gaga song
I want your bed romance, baby, just dance
Let's play a game, a foolish love game
And I'll put on my poker face tonight
Tonight feels right
Not tonight when you kiss me
Boy it feels so right
But your intentions will keep me up tonight
Wondering if you
Feel the way I do
I'm so confused but oh
Something don't feel right
Don't say it's true
You wanna hear I told you so
Hey I told you so
Feels like I'm caught in the crowd
And my guys coming down
Along with my hair
Oh baby it's not fair
I try to say no but it just comes
Oh, baby, you're driving me crazy
I'm caught in a scene from a Lady Gaga song
I want your bad romance, baby, just dance
Let's play a game, a foolish love game
And I'll put my poker face tonight
Tonight feels right, not tonight
Attraction is there but emotions aren't clear
I'm all over you, you're all over me
I try to pretend, put up my best defense
I'm all over you, you're all over me
How can I resist you?
Feels like I'm caught in the crowd
And my guy's coming down with my hair
Oh baby it's not fair
I try to say no but it just comes out as
Oh baby you're driving me crazy
I'm caught in a scene from a Lady Gaga
I want your bad romance, baby, just dance
Let's play a game, a foolish love game
And I'll put on my poker face
Tonight, tonight
Feels right, not tonight
