Patience my lover
You said it to me
You said it to me
I'm going under
So you're giving away
And leaving today
How many times you leave this town
you're angry with me
you're being afraid
So you're preaching now to me
When you touch the ground set me free
I'm not holding back such things
Since you're giving away, since you're letting it be
I'm a new lover
you give it to me
Yeah, you give it to me
I'm not saying I won't let you down
But big mistakes will vanish in the wild
I am the one who's supposed to drown
'Cause you're being afraid
And'cause you're being strange
So you're preaching now to me
And when you touch the ground
You set me free
I'm not holding back such a thing
Since you've given away
Since you let it be
So you're preaching now to me
When you touch the ground set free
I'm not holding back such things
Since you're giving away since you're letting it be
