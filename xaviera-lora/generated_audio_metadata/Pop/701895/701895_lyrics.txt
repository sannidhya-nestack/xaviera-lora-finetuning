You told me that you loved me
Never really felt those words
Told me you would die for me
What if I make it to the grave first
You told me you would wait for me
To hear me say them back
But I really couldn't do that
They were the last three things I
When you said I
My heart trembled inside love's
Not easy to find you
You said those words too soon
I have to go
But before I do
I want you to know
I could lie to you
Staying on my mind was goodbye
I've never had a hard time holding back tears in my eyes
Never had a problem sleeping alone'til I slept with you by my side
I guess I had a lot to lose
When I lost you
And in that moment of truth
I could lie to you (I)
My heart trembled in silence
Not easy to find you
You said those words too soon
I have to go
But before I do
I want you to know
I couldn't lie to you
These goosebumps I've tried to hide but
Sweaters can't keep these chills inside
It was one AM that night
When I left behind
The one thing
That was mine
You were the one thing
You were the one thing
You were the one thing
You were the one thing that was mine
That was I
My heart trembled inside those
Not easy to find you
You said those words too soon
I have to go
But before I do
I want you to know
I couldn't lie to you
