Pick up your chromosomes one by one
I'll throw shapes and circles all around just to make them mine
Just to make you mine
I'll play with your DNA any day
I'll paint it in blue and throw some orange in
It will be a new day
Same as yesterday
Bombs falling on the streets of London
Even though you're far away, we're gonna be okay
I float along your bloodstream if you let me in
I love every drop begging not to stop
Please don't look away
For today is the day
I'll walk along your jeans all night long
I'll make them look fine and pretend it's alright
We might be washed away
But tonight you should stay
Bombs falling on the streets of London
Even though you're far away
We're gonna be okay
Do you remember the month of December
The voice in the hall, the sound of the whole scheme of life
And us hiding
Do you remember
Month of December
The voice in the hall
The sound of the whole scheme of life
And us hiding
Do you remember the month of December?
The voice in the hall, the sound of the whole scheme of life
And us, the high day
Do you remember?
The month of December
Watchers everywhere
Voices that hold
The sound of the horse keep a voice
That speaks of hiding
Now pick up your chromosomes
One by one
Roll shapes and circles all around just to make them mine
Just to make you mine
I'll play with your DNA any day
I'll paint it in blue and throw some orange in it will be
A new day, same as yesterday
Bombs falling on the streets of London
Even though you're far away, we're gonna be
Trains passing by
Moons dancing high
Even though you're far away
We're gonna be
Like trains passing by
Moons dancing high
Even though we're far away, we're gonna be
