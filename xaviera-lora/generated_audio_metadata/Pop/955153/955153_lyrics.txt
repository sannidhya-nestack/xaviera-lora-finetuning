Sooner or later I gotta go home
And sleep in our old place all alone
I trashed every picture that you left behind
But you cling like a ghost in the corner of my eye
Wanna scrape you off my skin
Burn the memory of your kiss
I'd give anything
For you to love me but you don't
I'd give
Anything for you to come back but you won't
I wish I could let you go
I met this girl and she had it all
Anyone else would've come on real strong
Hard as I tried, could not catch the mood
she's just a girl and she isn't you
Wanna scrape you off my skin
But the wound goes further in
I'd give anything
For you to love me
But you don't
I'd give
Anything for you to come back
But you won't wish I could let you go
With some time and with space
I et, et your face
So I've heard, so they say
But I keep
Anything for you to love me
But you don't, I should kill
Anything for you to come back
But you won't
I wish I could let you
It's so hard to let you go
