The finer things in life
Just suddenly appear
So subtle yet so clear
The past can disappear
Over time
So let it go
And hold
The finer things
In line
Shown simply in a smile
Seen only by the heart
In every ocean breeze
And one hundred year old trees
So if you look
It's where you'll find the finer things in life
To look within, to leave the illusions and the fears
In the stillness comes the meaning
One heartfelt moment he was clear
To look within, to leave
The illusions and the fears
In the stillness comes the meaning
One heartfelt moment, it was clear
To look within, to leave
The illusions and the fears
In the stillness comes the meaning
One heartfelt moment it was clear
The finer things in life
Have always been right here
