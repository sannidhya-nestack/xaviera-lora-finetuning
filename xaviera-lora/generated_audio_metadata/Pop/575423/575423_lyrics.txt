Don't you ever dare to come around
Don't you ever dare to make a sound
I've been watching and look what I have found
You and your ladies sleeping around
Sleeping next to you every single night
Boy there's no way it don't feel right
You're avoiding me you're running away
Well you keep running but your lights will stay
So don't you ever dare to come around
Don't you ever dare to make a sound, oh
I've been watching, look what I have found, oh
You and your ladies sleeping around
You didn't even have the guts to tell
Me the truth, does that word bring a bell?
Spare me your lies, keep your defense somehow
Your ruthless lies, they scream so loud
So don't you ever dare to come around
Don't you ever dare to make a sound
I've been watching and look what I have found
You and your ladies sleeping around
Oh boy, you must have lost your mind
Why else could you be so blind?
You gave everything away
And lost a woman, a woman like me
So don't you ever dare to come around
Don't you ever dare to make a sound
I've been watching and look what I have found
You and your ladies are sleeping around
Don't you ever dare to come around, boy
Don't you ever dare to make a sound
I've been watching and look what I have found
You and your lazy sleeping around
