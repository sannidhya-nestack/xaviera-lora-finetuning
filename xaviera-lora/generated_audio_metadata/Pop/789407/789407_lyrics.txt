A long time in this other life
Those liars everywhere
Grave bystanders, their stupid minds
In famous lullabies
The land that has no mountains
Big river don't deny
Your blessed church of light
Lead all your sons to hell
This is your cursed spell
The lamb that has no mountains
Raise her voice to you
Tonight, tonight
Say hello to my sky
Tonight, tonight
It's been a long time since I've been to the big river town of mine
They say you can never, never, never, never leave the smell behind
I never want to say to anyone
I just have to prove to me
That something happens with this piece of life
And those who bought into see
The land that has no mountains
Raise a voice to you
Tonight, tonight
Say hello to my sky tonight (tonight, tonight) tonight
The land that has no mountains
Rays of eyes to you
Tonight, tonight
Say hello to my sky
Tonight, tonight
Say hello to my sky
Tonight, tonight
