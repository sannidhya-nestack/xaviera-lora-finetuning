Tell me the truth
About the birds that can now fly
Tell me the truth
About the seed that grew too much
Tell me the truth
'Bout you
how
Tell me the truth
Tell me
Where is the fire?
Well, it used to be
Tell me the truth about that broken rest
Tell me the truth about that open door
Where is the fire? Where is the beast?
Where is the fire? Where is the beast?
