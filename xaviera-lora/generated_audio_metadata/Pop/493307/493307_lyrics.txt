There are those who think I'm a man on a mission
Man with a vision or two
There are those who would laugh at my fear of decision
I think it's funny too
And I've been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of things
And I wonder why I know nothing
If I don't open up enough
Twist the knife deep in my gut
Lucky loser loves to fail
I'm on the edge, so push me in
Pain and pleasure breaks the skin
Happy here beyond the pale
On my bed of nails
Oh, I
Ooh, I, ooh
There are those who think I'm a man of ambition
A slave to a master plan
There are those who view me with doubt and suspicion
And I quite understand
I've been a lot of places and I
Have seen a lot of things and
I wonder why I know nothing
And I've known a lot of people and I
Tell a lot of things and I made them cry and all for nothing
If I don't open up enough
Twist the knife deep in my gut
Lucky loser loves to fail
I'm on the edge so push me in
Pain and pleasure breaks the skin
I'm happy here beyond the veil
On my bed of nails
What you gonna do when the sun goes down
What you gonna do when the night sun comes around
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I think it could use a kick
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Here it comes
Happiness is the best revenge
As you climb down from the fence again
Takes the wind right up your sails
Put asleep on a bed of nails
We're happier (what you gonna do when the sun goes down)
We're happier (here it comes again)
We're happier
