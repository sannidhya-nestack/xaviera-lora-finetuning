It's so hard sometimes to glue us together
We crack, fall apart, depending on the weather
So don't touch
I like it too much
It's so cold at night
By myself when we fight
I toss and I turn
Restless for salvation
I'm going crazy
Anticipating, hating, waiting for your call again
Don't touch, I like it too much
Restart, you're far too much
To take, I'm on my knees, yeah
Nothing but trouble
It's so hard to say no
To move on, to let go
And stick to my guns
One touch, I call mom's on
The sky is falling
The earth's shaking
I just can't seem to get you off my mind
Seeing is believing, words are deceiving
Trusting you ain't easy'cause you're saying this, doing that
Don't touch, I like it too much
Please stop, you're far too much
Don't take, I'm on my knees, yeah
Nothing but trouble
Seeing is believing
Words are deceiving
Loving you ain't easy
you're playing games all the time
Don't touch, I like it too much
Please stop, you're far too much
To take, I'm on my knees, you're nothing but trouble
Don't touch, I like it too much
Please stop, you're far too much
To take, I'm on my knees, you're nothing but trouble
Don't touch
Please stop
Don't touch
I'm a horny devil
Please stop
I'm a horny devil
And you're nothing but trouble
Don't touch
Please stop
I'm a horny devil
And you're nothing but trouble, don't touch
