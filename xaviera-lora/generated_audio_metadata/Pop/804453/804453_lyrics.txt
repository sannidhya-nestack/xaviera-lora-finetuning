I miss you, dig you, love you, mean it, bye
You kiss me, diss me, who the hell am I?
I met you, let you know, I don't know why
I miss you, dig you, love you, mean it, bye bye bye
I guess I should've known
You'd break me to the bone
Slick talker, cock blocker, going down
Stage pass rocker, you do what you please
(You're some shady sleeve)
I won't be chasing, just a racing
Gotta bounce, time be wasting
Love you mean it
Love you mean it
Love you mean it
Love you mean it
Love you mean it
I miss you, dig you, love you mean it, bye
You kiss me, diss me, who the hell am I?
I met you, let you now, I don't know why
I miss you, dig you, love you, mean it, bye bye bye
I'm stronger than you think
Be gone before you blink
Straight shooter, lapluder
Never be your hotel loser
You just missed the point
So rolling up the joints
You keep trying, justifying
Gotta bounce, I be flying
Love you mean it
Love you mean it
Love you mean it
Love you mean it
Love you mean it
Love me, hate me, you will never break me (love you mean it)
Love me, hate me (love you mean it)
You will never break me (love you mean it)
Love me, hate me, you will never break
Love me, hate me, you will never break me
