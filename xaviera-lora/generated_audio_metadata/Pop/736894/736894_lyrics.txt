When you look at me and all I choose to be
Then you see the things I never conquered
Can we choose to fight and hide the web of lies
Then you see the things I cannot offer
Placed a doubt in my mind
I can hardly recognize
The woman I used to call my comfort
I'm swallowed in your darkness
I'm swallowed in your darkness
No, no, no
Compare all I've done to the previous and now
Can't ive'cause you have not otten
Can you choose
The light that's burning in your eyes
And refuse to follow in your darkness
I'm swallowed in your
I'm swallowed in your darkness
My heart can't be with others
I'm swallowed in your darkness
It's like I've been made yourself
I'm swallowed in your darkness
