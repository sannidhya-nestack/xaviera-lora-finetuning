Time to go
It's time to go
Whatever this means
He's happy it seems
After night
In boundless light
He calls my name
I do the same
So I'll be a fleeting sound
The light way out on the
And I'll know his secret name
And tell him about the nighttime
After this, a simple kiss
Return my eyes, a true disguise
So I'll be a fleeting sound, a light way out on the water
And I'll know his secret name
And tell him about the nighttime
The gentle accent moves me forward
With secrets that I know are true
So I'll be a fleeting sound
And I'll know his secret name
And tell him about the nighttime
So I'll be a fleeting sound
A light gray out on the water
And I'll know his secret name
And tell him about the nighttime
Time to go (move me forward)
Time to go (don't want to)
