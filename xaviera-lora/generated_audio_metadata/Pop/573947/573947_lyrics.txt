You're lovely, completely
So different from my yesterdays
I don't question how deeply
I know your love is for always
Stories in your eyes there for all to see
The rhythm of your heart beating next to me
Tell me you're
You're wonderful
You make me feel alive
Got me smiling inside
Ba-ba-ba-da
You're wonderful
The sun up in my sky
You don't even try
You're wonderful
No picture can capture
The magic of someone so beautiful
The sparkle of your laughter
As I whisper soft and low
Now the story's in your eyes there for all to see
The rhythm of your heart beating next to me
Tell me you're
You're wonderful
You make me feel alive
Got me smiling inside
Ba ba ba da
You're wonderful
The sun up in my sky
You don't even try
You're wonderful
You're the silver in my cloud
Well I must have dreamed you
I wonder if you even know
Do you even know
You're wonderful
You make me feel alive
Got me smiling inside
You're wonderful, the sun up in my sky
You don't even try
You're wonderful, you're wonderful
You make me feel alive, got me smiling inside
Ba ba ba dum
You're wonderful
The sun up in my sky
You don't even try
You're wonderful
