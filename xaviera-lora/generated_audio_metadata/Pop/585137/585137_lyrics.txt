Woke up this morning to a bright new day
Feeling better since you went away
Can do what I want, say what I wanted to say
You always had a different plan
You always made me feel less of a man
By doing things I couldn't understand
That's why I'm not gonna love you no more, no more
And I'm not gonna need you anymore
I could see right through your lies
I could tell by that look in your eyes
It got to the point nothing you said could surprise me
You always had a different plan
You always made me feel less of a man
You always did things I couldn't understand
That's why I'm not gonna love you no more, no more
And I'm not gonna need you anymore
And I'm not gonna love you no more, no more
Not gonna need you anymore
What you did, you did to hurt me
I was blind and I could not see
And now I'm happy being who I want to be
You always had a different plan
You always made me feel less of a man
But doing things I couldn't understand
That's why I'm not gonna love you no more, no more
And I'm not gonna need you anymore
And I'm not gonna love you no more, no more
Not gonna need you anymore
That's why I'm
Not gonna love you no more, no more
And I'm
And I'm not gonna need you anymore
And I'm not gonna love you no more, no more
And I'm not gonna need you anymore, no
