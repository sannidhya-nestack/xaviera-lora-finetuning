It's a bomb
It's a bomb
It's a bomb
It's a bomb
Wake up
You better wake up
You better wake up
You better wake up and get your mind in order
On top like a billboard smash
Cause everywhere I go it's like first
I ain't coming at last
I got game and got the game on smash
It's nothing
I get it popping
Rocking I stop it
Yeah I'm in the club and the club stay rocking
I'm feeling like a villain when I'm killing rappers on tracks
You know me
Champagne on deck
I got it flowing
Yeah I got the dough and I
Break trees like my man Uncle Doe and I
It's going down
Order another round
Put your cups up and get blessed by the sound
This is how I do better, get used to it
Nobody does it better, you can be sure of it
I'm a prototype, karma flow unique
Pulling out the black card, let my money speak
So fresh, so clean, something y'all never seen
Plus a dime that look so mean in them jeans
And I'm good with the fluff, Smith-Fiona mic
How rip-tight, plus my swag is so bright
I told'em I'll be back when I'm back in the Maybach
Drunk full of stacks, Kenny paint all black
Kicks on my whip, all chrome, sittin' real low
Ridin' through the avenue, gotta let'em know
It's on, haters carry on
I got it right, you got it wrong
On the street with a X5, middle finger in the air
Or in the air with a G5, I stun hard
Switching lanes, show stopping at the red light
Popping bottles, clean glasses to the good life
Baller like a baller, gotta get my bread right
Shine like a star, trust me you don't wanna fight
Wake up
Check it
Check the progress how I push it to the limit
More bang for the buck no frills and no gimmicks
No biting and no mimics 100 % vintage
We played a lot of scrimmages not in it for image
They in it for a minute but I really gotta win it
If it ain't been done yet we can figure and invent it
Always push to keep my leverage up
From the streets to the office then arenas to the club
All in it for the love
Not only for the bread I spend a whole lot of time with crazy ideas in my head
Tryna push a new sled and keep the family fed
Just check the technique don't let it go to your head
'Cause we be getting down, nothing more, nothing less
And we ain't got no time for the stress, stayin' blessed
Every move calculated like if I was playing chess
Keep your ears to the streets and check the progress, yes
It's a crime
It's a crime
