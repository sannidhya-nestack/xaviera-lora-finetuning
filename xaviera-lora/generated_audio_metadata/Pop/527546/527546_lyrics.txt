Yeah
Dancing in your room on fire
Seems your eyes are blinding
You're like a mist, I'm so blinded
Your skin is drenched with desire
And it's kind of a misadmired
And I am hooked, I'm your regular buyer
But at the first rays of sunlight (first rays of sunlight)
You blow like a thief in the night (thief in the night)
And leave me broken on the floor begging for more and more
But you left a scar on my heart, scar on my heart
And baby I'm bleeding when you're leaving
This vaccine won't tear me apart
Scar on my heart, scar on my heart
Tells me baby I need you (need you) to heal me (heal me)
Too close to fame you've come so far
Scar on my heart
So hard, hard, hard, hard
Scar on my heart
You left a scar on my heart
I'm on top of your hit list
And I feel like a desert kid
I'm fighting a nurse I can't resist, no
I know you're not a liar
To turn the truth doesn't get you higher
I'm gone between the fence and the wire
But in the first rays of sunlight
I'm gone like a thief in the night
And leave me broken on the floor begging for more and more
But you left a scar on my heart
Scar on my heart
And baby I'm bleeding, while you're leaving
These I've seen, what's turned me upon
Scar on my heart, scar on my heart
Tells me baby I need you to heal me
Too close to fame you've gone so far
Scar on my heart
So hard, hard, hard, hard
Scar on my heart
You left a scar on my heart
Torn between pain and pleasure
Between feeling of and treasure
All I really need now is to know when we're together
As addictive as your love is
It hurts so bad when we do spin
So I just share with this dilemma
And I hold on to this
Scar on my heart, scar on my heart, woah
Oh, oh, oh
Scar on my heart, scar on my heart
Baby I'm bleeding when you're leaving
These feelings just go on my heart (go on my heart, go on my heart, yeah yeah yeah)
Trust me baby I need you, need you to heal me (heal me)
Too close to fail your kind so harsh
Tell me baby I need you (go on my heart, go on my heart)
To heal me baby
And baby I'm bleeding when you're leaving (tell me baby I need you, need you to heal me)
These feelings just go on my heart (go on my heart, go on my heart, yeah yeah yeah)
Tell me baby, are these the songs, yeah, oh
To let this go on my heart
