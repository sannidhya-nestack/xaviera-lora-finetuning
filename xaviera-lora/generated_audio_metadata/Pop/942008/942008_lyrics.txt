We keep talking at each other
In one ear and out another
Always fail to connect
Spitting out words that hurt me
I know you like fighting dirty
All your fear and pain I just reflect
Know that you're my poison but I take you anyway
I'm addicted to the ache I get from the things you say
My friends all think I'm crazy for holding on this way
Two dancers in the flames
We're playing with matches, that's a bad bad habit
One spark and we ignite and burn down to ashes
We're playing with matches, that's a bad bad habit
One spark and we ignite and burn down to ashes
Baby, I'm fire, your gasoline
Baby, I'm fire, your gasoline
Why do I find it so enticing
This battle feels so exciting
When every time
The pain is worse
Caught up in this endless war zone
But we can't leave each other alone
Is this love or is this just a curse?
I know that you're my poison and the venom runs so deep
I'm addicted to each part of you
Without you I can't sleep
I know that this is crazy but this life I choose to keep
It's such a foolish game
We're playing with matches
That's a bad, bad habit
One spark and we're igniting
Burned down to ashes
We're playing with matches
That's a bad bad habit
One spark and we igniting
Burned down to ashes
Baby I'm fire, your gasoline
Baby, I'm fire, your gasoline
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We're playing with matches
That's a bad, bad habit
One spark and we ignite it
Burn down two ashes
We're playing with matches
Bad, bad, heavy
One spark and we ignite
Burn down to ashes
Baby, I'm fire
You're gasoline
Baby, I'm fire
Baby, I'm fire, your gasoline (your gasoline)
Baby, I'm fire, your gasoline (your gasoline)
Baby, I'm fire, your gasoline
