It's been so long since I've seen you
So many things have come and gone
It was so hard when you left me
I never knew I could be this strong
Well did you find what you wanted?
Did all your dreams finally come true?
Or did you find it discovering?
That the end is all I'm given
Then you throw your arms around me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you want me
And I know
It's been so many years now
I still remember how it used to be
All the nights spent alone, yeah
How I loved you so faithfully
Well, I heard that you left you
I heard you found someone new
Or did you leave her for another?
Did you finally realize it's you
Then you throw your arms around me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you want me
And I know
Then you throw your arms around me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you want me
And I know
Then you throw your arms around me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you want me
And I know
Yeah, I know
Yeah, I know
Ooh, I know, I know
Ooh, I know, I know
No, no, I don't know
