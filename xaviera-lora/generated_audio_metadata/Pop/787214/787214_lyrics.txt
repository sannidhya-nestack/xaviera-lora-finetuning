When life is hard, there's sadness in your heart
It's so tough when lovers break apart
I need a small place in heaven here on earth
Now I want to feel what my loving was worth
That's all I ever wanted
All we ever need
All I ever wanted
Is there someone there?
All we ever need
Someone to share
All I ever wanted
All we ever need
Sometimes we'll stand here waiting for the rain
Some lost friend who needs sympathy again
But now we know that deep down here inside
Love is all the love for this feeling never died, never died
All I ever wanted
Is there someone there
All we ever need
Someone to share
All I ever wanted
Is there someone there
All we ever need
Someone to share
All I ever wanted
All we ever need
Is there someone, someone there
All we ever need
Someone to share all I ever wanted
All we ever need
All we ever need
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
My love can't seem to take away your pain
How can I find a way to try this all again?
Maybe one day I'll find a very special one
To share every moment, I'm the rising of the sun (I am the monster)
All we ever need
Someone to share
All I ever wanted
Is there someone there
All we ever need
Someone to share
All I ever wanted
All we ever need
All I ever wanted
All we ever needed
All I ever wanted
All we ever needed (All we ever wanted)
