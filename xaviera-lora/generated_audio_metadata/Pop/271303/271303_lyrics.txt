It's such a simple thing yet it's so profound
How the world stands still yet it's spinning round
It's such a simple thing yet I can't explain
How I feel the sun yet I see the rain
In oak scented rooms, in doorways and halls
They speak of the oceans dividing us all
They say it's harder to change things together
Than do it alone
It's such a simple thing and yet it stays the same
Could we share our love? Could we share the blame?
It's such a simple thing and yet it's so profound
How the world stands still and how it's spinning round
And I'm teaching my children
It's not out of reach
And they help me to practise the things that I preach
For it's harder to change things forever
And change them alone
In parks that are closed
Down long country lanes
In scenes by the wayside
That constantly change
The leaves that are falling
Are starting to cover the ground
Oh, but this isn't autumn, my heart isn't cold
This isn't the way you were supposed to grow old
And now it seems harder to go back wherever we've been
It's such a simple thing and yet it's so profound
How my world stands still, yet it's spinning round
