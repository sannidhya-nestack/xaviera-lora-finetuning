There's a party tonight
He invited me today at school
He'll be waiting there to dance with me
Gonna break parental rule
Not too young to fall in love
I'm not too young today (I'm not too young)
I'm old enough to know what I want
And they're too old to relate (and they're too old to relate)
I just wanna go
I don't wanna stay, I just wanna go
I gotta get away, I already know
What they're gonna say
They always say no, but I'm going anyway
I just wanna go, go, go, go, go
I don't wanna stay, no, no, no, no
I just wanna go, go, go, go, go
I don't wanna stay, no, no, no, no
I just wanna go, go
They've been on me lately
They found the letters that he wrote
And how I've been scribbling his name in my books
Instead of taking notes
Not too young to party
Not too young to stay out late
Tonight I'm gonna dance with him
I'll do whatever it takes
I just wanna go
I don't wanna stay
I just wanna go
I gotta get away
I already know
What they're gonna say
They always say no
But I'm going anyway
I just wanna go go go go go
I don't wanna stay, no, no, no, no
I just wanna go, go, go, go, go
I don't wanna stay, no, no, no, no
I just wanna go, go
I just wanna go! Well, what did he say?
No way! Your parents said what?
No they didn't. Calamir's leaving at my house. I'm gonna go!
How old? I just don't get it
Tonight's the night for freedom
Tonight's the night to fly
Tonight I'll make my own decisions, it's mine, all mine
I just wanna go, go, go, go, go
I just wanna go, go, go, go go
I just wanna go, go
