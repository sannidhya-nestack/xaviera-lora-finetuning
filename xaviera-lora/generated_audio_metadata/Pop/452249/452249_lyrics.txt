Girl, take my hand, lead me to that place we know
Where all the world fades away
Do you recall that place we used to go?
Oh, how I wish we could stay
We were two lovers in paradise that time I do adore
I'm wanting that some more (yes I do)
life is such a bore maybe tomorrow
We can run away and leave all this behind
This world is so confined
And we need to unwind
Let's go back to that place we used to go
Where all the world fades away
Please take me back to that place we used to know
Oh how I long for that day
We were two lovers in paradise
That time I do adore
I'm wanting that some more (yes I do)
Cause life is such a bore
Maybe tomorrow we can run away
And leave all this behind
This world is so confined
And we need to unwind
So girl
Let's go back to that place we used to go
Where all the world fades away
Please take me back to that place we used to know
Oh, how I long for that day
Oh, how I long for that day
