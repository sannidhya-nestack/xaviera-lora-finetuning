You rule my head, you rule my heart I knew you were right from the start
When you came and said hello I made my excuses to go
Like a schoolboy running scared
After leaving the love note
I was so unaware
Only you, only you can do that to me
Take me in and make it a tragedy
Shaking up my world
And I just can't let go
Only you, only you can play a waiting game
Lead me on, it feels like blasphemy
In another world
You'd be my only girl
Only you
Only you
Your cool as ice you made me freeze
I really thought I could believe
Then you dropped in your bombshell
That you were in love with Michelle
How could I measure up to a girl with size four feet?
I would never be enough, only you, only you can do that to me
Take me in and make it a tragedy, shaking up my world
And I just can't let go, only you
Only you can act up that way, lead me on
It feels like blasphemy in another world
You'd be my only girl, only you
Only you
Now I see you in the crowd
And you look so good with her
I don't feel so down
Only you, only you can do that to me
Take me in and make it a tragedy
Shaking up my world
And I just can't let go
Only you, only you can play a waiting game
Lead me on, it feels like blasphemy
In another world
You'd be my only girl, only you
Shaking up my world, and I just can't let go
Only you, only you can play a waiting game
Lead me on, it feels like blasphemy
In another world, you'd be my only girl
Only you
