There's a light in the room that seems to draw me to you
There's a pulse in the beat it wraps around my body
Electric shakes the atmosphere it radiates into a blur
I know exactly where to be, you should be holding on to me
Every time that we collide, it starts a war inside my mind
My spirit always knows you, we're supernatural
Every time that we collide
I wonder how have I survived
My spirit always knows you
We're supernatural
We're supernatural
We're supernatural
We're supernatural
There's a void we're trying to fight
The world that keeps us all night
Breathing in the jaded air
We set the sky a red flare
Electric shakes the atmosphere
It radiates into a blur
I know exactly where to be
You should be holding on to me
Every time the wicked light
It starts a war inside my mind
My spirit always knows you
We're supernatural
Every time I wake at night
I wonder just how I survived
My spirit always knows you
We're supernatural
We're supernatural
We're supernatural
