Had a crazy dream last night
Waiting for the morning light
Crescent moon was just out of reach
Made a wish as we ran on the beach
Jump in the ocean without a life vest
Before I land got one request
Catch me I'm falling for you
Skydiving without a parachute
It's something I swore I wouldn't do
But you're my favorite taboo
Catch me I'm falling for you
Catch me, been around enough to know
When it's good, don't stall, just go (just go)
Take a chance on love, let it play
Let the chips land where they may
I try to play hard to get
But you're playing hard to et
Catch me, I'm falling for you
Skydiving without a parachute
It's something I swore I wouldn't do
But you're my favorite taboo
Catch me, I'm falling for you
Catch me
If you're hearing this I say, it's already way too late
Even when you walk on by, I get a contact high
Serious or laugh attack, double down or send it back
Wanna know when the ride gets rough, are you strong enough
To hang tough, hang tough
Catch me, I'm falling for you
Skydiving without a parachute
It's something I swore I wouldn't do
But you're my favorite taboo
Catch me, I'm falling for you
Catch me
Catch me, I'm falling for you
Catch me I'm falling for you
Catch me I'm falling for you
Catch me I'm falling for you
Catch me I'm falling for you
Catch me I'm falling (ah, ooh) (ah)
