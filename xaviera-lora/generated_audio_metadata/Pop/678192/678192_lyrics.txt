And you know what, this is for you
I hear what you say about me
I honestly don't believe
That I waste my tears over your words
Woah oh oh
It doesn't mean anything
But somehow it still stings
And oh my goodness, does it hurt?
What do you hope to gain?
From making me feel this way
No I won't break
I won't let you bring me down
I won't trust in what I found
Me myself and I are okay
Hit me up and walk away
I'm not afraid to cry sometimes
Cause after the rain the sun will shine
With the sun comes a brand new day
And me myself and I are okay
Me myself and I are okay
Get me myself and I'll okay
Get me myself and I'll okay
Get me myself and I'll okay
So go on and talk it up
When it's all said and done
I hope you feel better about yourself
So do what you gotta do
I already know the truth
It's not how you feel about me
It's how you feel about you
I won't let you bring me down
I will trust in what I found
Me, myself and I are okay
Pick me up and walk away, ay
I'm not afraid to cry sometimes
after the rain the sun will shine
With the sun comes a brand new day
And me myself and I are okay
Me myself and I are okay
Me myself and I are okay
Me myself and I are okay
Me myself and I are okay
It hurts, but not the way you think it does
I feel sorry that you need
To tear me down to build you up
And no, I don't agree with what you have to say
I won't let it break me down
I won't let you rain on my parade
I won't let you bring me down (bring me down)
Won't trust in what I found (yeah)
Me, myself and I are okay
Pick me up and walk away, ay
I'm not afraid to cry sometimes (sometimes)
after the rain the sun will shine
With the sun comes a brand new day
And me, myself and I are okay
I won't let you bring me down
I won't trust in what I found
Me, myself and I are okay
Pick me up and walk away
I'm not afraid to cross the downs
after the rain the sun will shine
With the sun comes a brand new day
And me, myself and I are okay
Me, myself and I are okay
Me, myself and I are okay
Oh, oh, oh, get me myself in now
Oh, oh, oh, get me myself in now
Oh, oh, oh, get me myself in Now
Oh, oh, oh, get me myself in Now
Oh, oh, oh, get me myself in Now
Oh, oh, oh, get me myself inNow
Oh, oh, oh, get me myself in
