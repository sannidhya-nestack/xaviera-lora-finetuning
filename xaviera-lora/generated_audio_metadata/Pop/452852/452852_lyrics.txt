Cracked lips in dry winter winds
I lived with chills in my heart
Patched up by safety pins
So glad that's all in the past
No longer falling, no longer falling (when I'm next to you)
When I'm next to you, when I'm next to you
When I'm next to you, when I'm next to you
I'm invincible
When I'm next to you, when I'm next to you
When I'm next to you, when I'm next to you
I'm invincible
I'm invincible
We kiss like Eskimos
I feel your breath on my neck
Night sky glows indigo
We watch the moon as it sets
When I'm next to you, I'm invincible
When I'm next to you, I'm invincible
I'm invincible
A late September afternoon
I saw you walk into the early rising moon
Your clothes were styled by the wind
I watched you watch me soak you in
Now I can do anything
I can do anything
We kiss, we kiss, we kiss, we kiss, we kiss
We kiss like Eskimos
When I'm next to you, I'm invincible
We kiss like Eskimos (ooh)
When I'm next to you, I'm invincible (ooh)
When I'm next to you, I'm invincible
When I'm next to you, I'm invincible
When I'm next to you, I'm invincible
I'm invincible
I'm invincible
