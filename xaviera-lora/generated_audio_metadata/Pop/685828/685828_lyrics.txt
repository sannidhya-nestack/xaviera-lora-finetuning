If you called me yesterday
Things would have been the same
But you called me today
Now everything has changed
I am living in paranoia
I am tired of not breathing
I feel like jumping from the sky
And not be scared at all to die
To die
How much I don't know
Like broken bones being tied up
Dangling in the wind
Then it came to me
What it is that makes me happy
I am living in paranoia
I am tired of not breathing
I feel like jumping from the sky
And not be scared at all to die
To die
I am circumcised
I'm running through a storm
Spirits changing form
Running through a storm
Spirits changing form
