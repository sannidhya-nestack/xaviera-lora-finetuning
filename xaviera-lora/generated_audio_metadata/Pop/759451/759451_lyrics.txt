I did, I did, I did, I did, I did, I did, I did, I did ,I did, I did, I did, I did
Oh siren how your voice is sweet
What are you singing in the rocks
Oh siren how your voice is sweet
Who are you calling from the docks
Through season storms and winds above
Let vanish your sadness down
Oh Siren, you're the bride of love
Of demon who's always frowned
Oh Siren, son of you is sweet
In cloudless night of empty rock
Oh Siren, demon you're indeed
You are my love in pleasure stroke
Through seas and storms and winds above
That vanish your sadness down
Oh siren you're the bride of love
Of demon who is always frown
Who's always wrong?
Through seas and storms and winds above
Let vanish your
Sadness down
Oh, Siren, be the bride of love
Of Demon, who is always from
Who's always wrong
Who is always wrong?
