I wanna buy you diamonds, I wanna buy you pearls
Fly you to every corner of the world
If I only had the means I'd give you everything
But till then have some faith in our little dream
You gotta be all in on love
All in on love, all in on love, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be all in on love
All in on love, all in on love, You gotta be, you gotta be
I'm gonna work my tail off and make a happy home
I'll fix your car, I'll even fix your telephone
I am gonna cherish you like you have never been
Love will line up for you, baby
If you will join in, you're gonna be all in on love
All in on love, all in on love
You gotta be, you gotta be
You gotta be all in on love
All in on love, all in on love
You gotta be, you got to be
All in on love, all in on love
You gotta be, you gotta be in love
Ooh, love will light our fortune, yeah
If you will join in, yeah
If we stay in love
Don't play with those bad boys
They'll mess you up inside
They don't give a damn
They're gonna take you for a ride
Give you lots of empty words
But nothing from the heart
Our love is special
So come on and take her
You gotta be all in on love, all in on love, all in on love
You gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be all in on love, all in on love, all in on love
Hey, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be
You gotta be all, all, all
You gotta be all in on love
You gotta be all in our love
You gotta be all
You gotta be all
All in all love (all in all love)
All in all love
With me and I we'll be (all in all love)
In love with you (all in all love)
All in all love you gotta be (you gotta be)
You gotta be (all in all love)
You gotta be (all in all love)
All in all love (you gotta be)
You gotta be (you gotta be)
All in all love
All in love, all in love, all in love, all in love
Hey, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be, you got to be
