Calling on this day
Stop just listen before you take me away
From my family
Together we may stay
Made it through the past years
Maybe destiny doesn't belong here
And maybe it's no good
I don't own your love and I don't own mine
No, no, no, I can't fail you
But when I do and I'll be hoping
That you'd feel the same way too
And I'll take all the love in my heart and give it back to you
Started out okay
Sometimes you need to stop and wait
A new day, another warm
Maybe it's no good
That I don't own your love and I don't own mine
No, no, no, I can't fail you
But when I do and I'll be hoping
That you'd feel the same way too
Then I'll take all the love in my heart and give it back to you
Hey, and maybe it's no good, no
That I don't own your love and I don't own mine
No, no, no, and I can't fail your
But when I do and I'll be hoping
That you'd feel the same way too
And I'll take all the love in my heart
And I'll take all the love in my heart
And I'll take all the love in my heart
And give it back to you
I'll give it back to you
I give it back to you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
