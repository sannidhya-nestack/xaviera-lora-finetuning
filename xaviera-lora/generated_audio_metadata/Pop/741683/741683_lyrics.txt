Save a dance for me, let's go get lost
Hide away with me, we won't be caught
I just wanna get away with you
I just gotta get away with you
Save the best for last, it's me and you
Take the night, hold me under the moon
I just wanna get away with you
I just gotta get away with you
I just wanna get away with you
I gotta get away with you
Take my hand, don't let it go, go
Take a chance, just hold me close
We can go where no one knows, knows
I wanna get away with you
I just wanna get away with you
I just gotta get away with you
I just wanna get away with you
I gotta get away with you
