You're chasing moonbeams
So you say you need between is bourgeois and geeks
Makes sense to me
You swear they're gluten free
Just let me try that yeah
I live at the beach
I'm on home's retreat
You said you like my new beat
And you dig my scene
You just wanna hang with some beers
You're as cool as neon jeans
Crazy as johnny jeans
Taste you like the virgin cuisine
Don't call it love, we're like uncharted
And we don't care about the dump of dating stuff
We'll have some fun with something casual
Doing things that make our hearts buzz
And we'll be tripping like the young turf
We'll be tripping like the young turf
Too lost to jump
Yeah all those corporate things
Who treat you discreet
See what you mean
No I'm not strong
I like indie
only vinyl smells real
Hate MP3
There's no head over heels
we don't like extremes
We just wanna hang with some beers
So let's drive in low gear
We know how we feel
Today we're just exploring frontiers
Don't call it love
We like a Jordan
And we don't care about the complicated stuff
We'll have some fun with something casual
Doing things that make our hearts buzz
And we'll be tripping like the young turfs
We'll be tripping like the young turfs
And we'll be tripping like the young turf
We'll be tripping like the young turfs
Don't call it love, feel like I'm charting
And we don't care about the complicated stuff
We'll have some fun with something casual
Doing things that make our hearts buzz
And we will be tripping like the young turks
Doing things that make our hearts burst
And we will be tripping like the young turks
And don't care about the complicated stuff
And we'll be tripping like the young turks
We'll be tripping like the young turks
And we'll be tripping like the young turks
We'll be tripping like the young turks
