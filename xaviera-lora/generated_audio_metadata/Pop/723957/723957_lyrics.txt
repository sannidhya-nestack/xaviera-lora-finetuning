Floating away
Keep us alive
Keep me inside
There is no letting go
Baby, find me again
Baby, find me again
A chain is breaking
I don't know where to begin
Why am I here begging to win?
I am not letting go baby
Find me again
I'll be right here waiting baby
Find me again
Don't let us take a fall
Don't close another door
We used to have it all
But we don't anymore
Oh baby I won't turn away
It's gonna be okay and we will be fine
We are not over
For me yeah
I'm holding your hand
Fighting you back in my life
No one to blame, nowhere to hide
Without you I'm dying
Baby, find me again
You gotta keep trying
Baby, find me again
Don't let us take a fall, don't close another door
We used to have it all, but we don't anymore
Oh baby I won't turn away, it's gonna be okay and we will be fine
We are not over, oh
We will be fine, we are not over
Life is on hold right now
Waiting for a sign
Don't you remember I am yours
And you are mine
Don't let us take a fall
Don't close another door
We used to have it all
But we don't anymore
Baby find me again
I am right here waiting
Don't let us take a fall, don't close another door
We used to have it all, but we don't anymore
Don't let us take a fall, don't close another door
We used to have it all, but we don't anymore
I won't turn away, it's gonna be okay
We will be fine, we are not over, baby
Find me again, we will be fine, we are not over
Don't turn away, it's gonna be okay
We will be fine, we are not over, oh
We will be fine, we are not over
Baby, find me again
