I want to run away with you
I want to hold your hand
And point at things like pretty flowers
And make promises and plans
Talk ourselves into an avenue
And drive each other mad until it's gone
How long till it's gone?
How long till it's gone?
We talk big, we get bitter
We wear our misery on our sleeves
We love hard, kill each other
We do it right
We talk big, we get bitter
We wear our misery on our sleeves
We love hard and kill each other
We do it recklessly
They're tying loops around their ankles to their flickering TVs
I see their lackluster religions and their neighbourhood entries
And all the air conditioned loneliness inside the SUVs until it's gone
How long till it's gone
How long till it's gone?
We talk big, we get bitter
We wear our misery on our sleeves
We love hard, kill each other
We do it right
We talk big, we get bitter, we wear our misery on our sleeves
We love hard and kill each other, we do it recklessly
La-dum-dum-dum, la-dum-dum, la-dum-dum, la-dum-dum
La-dum-dum-dum, la-dum-dum
La-dum-dum-dum
