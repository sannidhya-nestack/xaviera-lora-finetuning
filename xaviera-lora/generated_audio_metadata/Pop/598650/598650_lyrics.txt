I lay beneath the rubble of my life
Yet I believe, I believe
That even though I used to take what's mine and run
Love sets me free
But each day's up to me
And I'll never be the person that I was again
And I'll never live so blindly
And here's where I began, not where I end
And now I declare myself redeemed
I fell face down into this desperate time
Yet still I breathe, still I breathe
And although I can barely face the way I've lived
I look at me and I see someone kinder I could be
And I'll never be the person that I was again
And I'll never live so blindly
And here's where I began, not where I end
Now I declare myself redeemed
Grudge has thrown out the window
I'll clear some room to grow
And I'll never be the person that I was again
And I'll never live so blindly
And here's where I began, not where I end
Now I declare myself redeemed
And here's where I began, not where I end
And now I declare myself redeemed
