Woo-hoo, the pleasures of a conversation
That I ain't trying to have
I am running to the nearest place that's far from you
I have heard it all from you
I got enough to last
It would make me happy to see you save it for me
Sometimes I want to be known
Sometimes I need to be alone
And I will tell you to save it for me
And I will say this sarcastically
Save me some of that what you have for me
I'll be there I promise I promise
Save it for me
Why don't you leave what you got at the table
I'll pick it up later
Brushing through obstacles
Dodging poles sometimes people feed me lines I can't digest
So I will just say ingest
Save me some of that what you got
I'd get on top of it once you stop a bit
Stressin', lyin', tryin', tying me up there
I don't think that you're aware
Watch me jump to my feet
I see you heading for me
You've got a story to tell
You're much too close I can smell
So I will ask you to save it for me
And I will say this sarcastic knee
If you watch me stay here and listen, watch me listen (I want to hear all of that English more)
My eyes will glaze over while you talk days over (Yeah yeah, sure sure)
This outlast music you should feel alive (I want to hear all of that English more)
I'm on my way somewhere else away
Ooh yeah yeah sure sure
I want to hear all of that
And much much more
Save it for me
Save me some of that what you have for me
I'll be there, I promise, I promise, save it for me
Why don't you leave what you've got at the table
I'll pick it up later
I don't know why I feel it so
I just do, I just do
Ooh yeah yeah sure sure
I want to hear all of that
And much much more
Save it for me
Ooh yeah yeah sure sure
I want to hear all of that
And much much more
Save it for me
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, I want to hear all of that
And much, much more, save it for me
