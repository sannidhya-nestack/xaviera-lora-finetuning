Honey, I love our journey
Years of you and me
My dear, we made through this year
And we built our dream
Open, my eyes are open
Ready for another new day
I'm sure, yeah baby, I'm sure
We'll be going on our way
Are you cooking? I love when you do it
I love starting the day like this
Are you smiling? I love when you do it
I love starting the day like this
Oh yeah
You, me, coffee and the sunshine
Isn't it marvelous?
You, me, coffee and the sunshine
It's all about us
It's all about, it's all about
You, me, Kovkin, the sunshine
It's all about us
Problems we are used to solve them
They change like the weather
Where it's not, I'm not worried
We will face them together
Are you laughing? I love when you do it
I love starting the day like this
Are you wishing? I love when you do it
I love starting the day like this, oh yeah
You, me, coffee in the sunshine
Isn't it marvelous?
You, me, coffee in the sunshine
It's all about us
It's all about (it's all about)
It's all about (it's all about)
You, me, cough in the sunshine
It's all about us
Every day is amazing
Every new day's all I'm waiting
Every day is amazing (Every day)
Every new day's all I'm waiting (Every day)
You, me, coffee and the sunshine
Isn't it marvelous?
You, me, coffee and the sunshine
It's all about us
It's all about (it's all about)
It's all about (it's all about)
You, me, cough in the sunshine
It's all about us
Isn't it marvelous?
It's all about us
Isn't it marvelous
It's all about us
