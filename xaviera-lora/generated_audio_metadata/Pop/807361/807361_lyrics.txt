Sands of time
Sands of time
Took the long way home tonight
Through our old neighborhood
Eleven years have passed just like a day
The school yard where we used to play is now a shopping mall
The tree where we once carved our names is gone
Oh it's gone
The sands of time are running out on you and I
It doesn't matter how we try
We're never gonna stop the sands of time
So take my hand, we'll live each moment while we can
We'll swim against the ocean tide
And build our castles in the sands of time
Sands of time
It's hard to go back home again
When everything has changed
Nothing that we knew has stayed the same
It's hard to go back home again
When everything has changed
Something that no one can take away
Take away
The sands of time are running out on you (you and I)
It doesn't matter how we try (how we try)
We're never gonna stop the sands of time
So take my hand, we'll live each moment while we can
We'll swim against the ocean shine
And build our castles in the sands of time
The sands of time are running out on you and I
It doesn't matter how we try
We're never gonna stop the sands of time
So take my hand, we'll live each moment while we can
We'll swim against the ocean, shine, and build our castles in the sands of time (in the sands of time)
In the sands of time (in the sands of time) In the sands of time
Send the time
Send the time
