Woke up in the moonlight
Thinking'bout you all night
You're my daily delight
Coffee to my appetite
When I'm feeling kinda low
You pick me up, you make me glow
With every sip my heart will show
Our love for you, it starts to flow
Just like coffee in my cup
You keep me warm, you lift me up
Every drop makes me feel love
Just like coffee from above
You're my morning, you're my noon
You're my night when stars are true
Sugar sweet in every tune
Love's a melody we crew
Through the sugar and the cream
You and I were like a dream
Hand in hand we'll quite the team
Just like coffee sweet it seems
Just like coffee in my cup
You keep me warm, you lift me up
Every drop makes me feel alive
Just like coffee from above
You're my morning, you're my noon
You're my night when stars are strewn
Sugar sweet in every tune
Love's a melody we croon
Just like coffee in my cup
Keep me warm, you lift me up
Every drop makes me feel alive
Just like coffee from above
