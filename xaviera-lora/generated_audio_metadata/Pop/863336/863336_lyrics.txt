Just the road that I see
I want to take
Quite far, I think
But I want to live
Full of stars, trees and flowers
In which I can hide
In the land of my birds
Far away from the life that I know
Far away from the noise of the grey city
Far far away otherwise existence
Far far away
Otherwise existent
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba (Be in the moment)
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba (Come on)
Ba ba (Be in the moment)
Ba ba ba ba (Come on)
Ba ba (Be in the moment)
Ba ba (Be in the moment)
Because I'm the kind of girl that can't be found, no, no, no
It's a road that I love where I renew myself
It's a place where I et who I am
Full of otherwise existence to get away
For there you can find yourself
Far away from life and I know
Far away from the noise of the grey city
Far far away otherwise existence
Far, far away
Otherwise, existence
Ah, they call my home
Ah, ah
