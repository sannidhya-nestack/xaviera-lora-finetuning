I want a car in the drive, we got it
I want a car in the drive, we got it
You want it all, straight to the party
Been here before, so don't be tardy
My talk ain't cheap, don't take it lightly
Just write this down, take it politely
Right now baby baby you can make it happen
Right now baby baby make your mama proud
I want a car in the driveway, got it
I want my music on the replay (Got it)
I want some flowers on the nightstand (Got it)
Cash money in the right hands (Got it)
Before we get to doing this I think it's clear to see
I won't be going through with this to end up losing me
I want a car in the driveway (Got it)
I want a car in the driveway (Got it)
You want my time, I want your hours
You give it all, you'll get the power
My heart is gold, won't let you break it
Show some respect, and we can make it
Right now baby baby you can make it happen
Right now baby baby make your mama proud
I want a car and a driveway got it
I want my music on the replay (Got it)
I want some flowers on the nightstand (Got it)
Cash money in the right hands (Got it)
Before we get to doing this I think it's clear to see
I won't be going through with this to end up losing me
I want a car in the driveway (Got it)
I want a car in the driveway (Got it, check)
Do you feel me? Do you feel me? Do you feel me?
I want a car in the driveway, got it? (Got it)
I want my music on the replay, got it? (Got it)
I want some flowers on the nightstand, got it? (Got it)
Cash money in the right hands, got it? (Got it)
Before we get to doing this, I think it's clear to see
I won't be going through with this to end up losing me
I want a car and a drive, we got it
I want a car and a drive, we got it
