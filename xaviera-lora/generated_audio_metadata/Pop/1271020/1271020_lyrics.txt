Oh, woke up in the morning light
Sunshine makes everything light
Got no worries in my sight
Feels like it's gonna be bright
Walking down the busy street
Smiling at everyone I meet
Feel the rhythm in my feet
A little kid that just can't be beat
Luckily, luckily feeling so free
Everything's falling in place for me
Luckily, luckily can't you see
Life's a dream as sweet as can be
Dancing in the afternoon glow
Where this path leads I don't know
But happily I will go
This happy heart that I tore
Stars are sparkling in the sky
Night arrives, I don't ask why
Grateful for the days gone by
Luck is smiling, I feel fine
Luckily, luckily feeling so free
Everything's falling in place for me
Luckily, luckily can't you see
Life's a dream as sweet as can be
Dancing in the afternoon glow
Where this path leads I don't know
But happily I will go
With this happy heart that I told
Stars are sparkling in the sky
Night arrives, I don't ask why
Grateful for the days gone by
Luck is smiling, I feel fine
Luckily, luckily, feeling so free
Everything's falling in place for me
Luckily, luckily, can't you see
Life's a dream, as sweet as can be
[Muffled voice]
