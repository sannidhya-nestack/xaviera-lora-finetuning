My emotions are running away
They're going haywire
I'm counting down the days
I'll have to live without her
I guess I'll just have to get used to loving from a distance
I know that this is my life, but I can't live, no I can't live it lately
Is this what love's supposed to be? It almost feels like misery
You got my heart on puppet strings and you control the direction of the wind baby
And speaking of a breeze, oh, no one said it was gonna be easy
I'm on fire, and I'm burning alive, I'm drowning
I've got water inside my lungs, and it's hard to breathe
But it's sure damn worth this pain to me
You're worth the world to me
Is this what love's supposed to be? It almost feels like misery
You got my heart on puppet strings and you control the direction of the wind baby
And speaking of a breeze, woah
No one said this was gonna be easy
You mean the world to me, I'll show you eternity
I can't wait for Casey, she'll make you so happy
That's what I want you to always be
You mean the world to me, I'll show you eternity
I can't wait for KC, she'll make you so happy, oh
