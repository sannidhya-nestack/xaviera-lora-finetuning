Whoa, whoa, blind
When you're on my mind
You can see the signs
It ain't hard to find
One eye
Tend to close my eyes
And I'm paralyzed
Conversation dies
So now you know
Now you know
Now you know
I love you so
Love you so
And I got this ache
How I never talked to you, and you never even knew my name, knew my name, and it rains, and it rains down
Someday when the lights fade, and the nights make, all the hearts break
You will, you will be with me, you will come to see, you can't stand to be
Without me, never doubt me
I'm your one love, one love
Quote me someday you'll see
I'm your one love, one love yeah
Baby, baby, woah woah
I can feel the pain, I can see your face, and I just need a taste, don't know, where I'm going wrong, why won't you come along, know it could take a long time, now you know, now you know, now you know, I
Love you so, love you so, and I got this ache
I might break over
How I never talked to you
And you never even knew my name
And it rains, and it rains down
Someday when the lights fade
And the nights make all the hearts break
You will, you will be with me
You will come to see, you can stand to be
Without me, never doubt me
I'm your one love, one love
Vote me someday you'll see
I'm your one love
One love, yeah
Woah, woah, I'm your one love
Woah, woah, woah, woah
I'm your one love
Someday when the lights fade and the nights make all the hearts break
You will, you will be with me, you will come to see, you can't stand to be
Someday when the lights fade and the nights make all the hearts break
You will, you will be with me, you will come to see, you can't stand to be
Without me, never doubt me, I'm your one love, one love
Quote me someday, you'll see, I'm your one love, one love
Without me, never doubt me, I'm your one love, one love
Quote me someday, you'll see, I "m your one love, one love yeah
