Last night down on Becker Street
Where all those hungry wolves and evening ladies meet
I saw you slip out of your car
And make your way into our favorite bar
I heard the cats that play on Wednesday night
And I began to see the light
As we danced to the music
Caught your glances oh so slight
Saw you peek into the corner
From the corner of my eye
Now I know it was all part of the plan
You had a thing for that trumpet playing man
Remember how it used to be
I played that sweet guitar
Your eyes shone for me
And now you'll trade those dearly things
The wind has changed
To brass and horny things
I'll drink Scotch whiskey to the dick and blues
And you can live the life you choose
Don't you lose my number
Keep it tucked inside your coat
Never know just when that trumpet
Might produce a sour note
You may find his whole routine a royal scam
Baby where now of that trumpet playing man
He's the king of scammy scandals, a dishonest Dr. Woo
We both know that Katie lies, but he does too
Don't you lose my number, keep it tucked inside your coat
Never know just when that trumpet might produce a sour note
You may find his whole routine a royal scam
Baby, where now of that trumpet playing man?
