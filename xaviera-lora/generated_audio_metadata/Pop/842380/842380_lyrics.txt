I've heard the heart is a lonely hunter
I've heard the heart is a lonely hunter
I'm a pearl diver in an ocean blue
A sole survivor
Still I don't find you
I drag the ocean floor
Searching everywhere
Won't know what I'm looking for
Till I get there
I've heard the harm
I heard the heart is a holy hunter
Lonely hunter
I heard the heart is a holy hunter
I do my best to lay
The perfect trap for you
I use myself for bait
Still it all falls through
I wear my camouflage
So tell me who's to blame
When you dodge and the hunter is captured by the game
I've heard the heart is a lonely hunter (I've heard the heart is a lonely hunter) (Lonely hunter) (I've heard the heart)
A bird is a homely hunter
Little one, have your fun
Morning moon, embrace the sun
Lift your eyes to the sky
Spread your wings and fly high
I've heard the heart is a lonely hunter
The door to love was shut
Though I begged and pleaded
'Til you came and gave me what I never knew I always needed
And now my heart is like a lonely hunter, lonely hunter
My heart's low, my heart's low, lonely hunter
And now I'm a home, and now I'm a home
Lonely hunter, lonely hunter, lonely hunter
