Such a simple thing in the open rain
Hand in hand, no need to explain
Under clouds so grey, lighting up the night
Eyes so bright, our hearts take flight
Catching rain drops away with you
Splashin' dreams come true, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Lost in our own blue, blue, blue
Just me and you, hmm, hmm, hmm
Laughin' through the storm
Dancin' on our own
Nothin' else around
Just the unknown
Every drop of me
Every step so sweet
Will end us in the rain
Just the unknown
Every drop of beat
Every step so sweet
With embers in our brain
Nothing feels the same
Catching rain drops away with you
Splashing dreams come true
Now I'm lost in our own blue
Just me and you
Oh, oh, oh
