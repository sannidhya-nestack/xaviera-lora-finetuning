I'm under attack, caught up in your fire
It breaks my heart to watch the only thing I believed expire
And you took everything I had
And nothing that you said
Ever meant a thing
Every vow that you made
Has been abused and betrayed
I'm giving up
I'm giving up
I never could have known
That the good times were unknown
And you'd make me pay
Will you break me today?
Deny me my life
Take away my whole world
With just one strike
With the raise of your head
My will falls apart
You're breaking me down, down, down
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down
I understand
It's the only way you know how
If you'd only put your fears down
The healing could begin now
So many times you could have shown
How as a man you have grown
But you turned away
And you'll break me today
Deny me my life
Take away my whole world with just one strike
With the raise of your hand, my will falls apart
You're breaking me down, down, down
Breaking me down
Down, down, down, down
Break me down, won't you break me down
This time it's one too many
And I'm not gonna take this anymore
And although you've held me down
It's time I turn this back around
So I'm making you stand to take back my life
Escaping your world of fear and lies
As they take you away with blood on your hands
I've broken you down, down, down
Broken you down
