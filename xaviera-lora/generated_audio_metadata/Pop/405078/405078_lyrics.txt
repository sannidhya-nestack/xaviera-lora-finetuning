People say, always look for signs
Pushed in every way, I took the road that's mine
People say, do it all the same
Sign up your t-ball, not gonna play that game
Maybe I'm blind but I know what's right
And I may stumble and fall
As I search for the light
Maybe I'm blind but now I see
Who I'm supposed to be
maybe, but maybe I'm blind
Why don't I take the easy road
Seems so much better than all the things I know
Why do I always feel so strong
About the way I think
And I don't know if I'm wrong
And baby I'm lying but I know what's right
And I may stumble and fall
As I search for the light
I'm blind but now I see who I'm supposed to be
Cause maybe or maybe I'm blind
Wasting my mind on all those things I should have done
Not turning back, I'm living my way, oh
maybe I'm lying, but I know what's right
And I may stumble and fall
As I search for the light
And maybe I'm blind
But now I see
Of who I'm supposed to be
Cause maybe
But maybe I'm blind
Maybe I'm blind
But I know what's right
And I may stumble and fall
As I search for the light
Oh, maybe I'm blind
But now I see
Who I'm supposed to be
But maybe, maybe I'm blind
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
