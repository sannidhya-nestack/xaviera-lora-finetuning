Who writes the cards that will decide the fate of all from far and wide?
Who casts the net? Who draws us in? Where does it end? Where does it begin? What about us?
And the love we had
And the things you said we'd try to do together in our lives
Whatever choice you had was robbed from you
Alone and cold before the sun shines through
Seasons changing, birds are flying by
South of that border, that's where they'll be
There is just one thing I need to know
Then you can let me go (then you can let me go)
No fear as children
Long we play
We all grow up
And learn our way
Sometimes we draw
That lucky straw
While others fall
On stony floor
I can et
But when the music plays
All the memories flooding back are just too hard to chase away
You never said that you'd come back for me
I counted days until the time broke free
Seasons changing, birds are flying by
South of that border, that's where they'll be
There is just one thing I need to know
Then you can let me go
Seasons changing, birds are flying by
South of that border, that's where they'll be
There is just one thing I need to know
Then you can let me, then you can let me go
And if you ever fall back
I will try and hold you back
Then you don't know me at all
I would catch you if you fall
And if you ever fall back
I will try and hold you back
Then you don't know me at all
I would catch you if you fall
Seasons changing, birds are flying by
South of that border, that's where they'll be
There is just one thing I need to know
Then you can let me go
Seasons changing, birds are flying by (flyin' by)
South of that border, that's where they'll be (ooh)
There is just one thing I need to know (I need to know)
Then you can let me (I need to know)
Then you can let me go (yeah)
Seasons changing, birds are flying by (flyin' by)
Seasons changing, birds are flying by, singing
