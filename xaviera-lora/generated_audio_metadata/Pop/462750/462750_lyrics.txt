A woman's on the corner, looking quite forlorn
You stop to offer help as her jacket's rather worn
You think you know her as you look into her face
A troubled soul, you're familiar with her case
You get your wallet out, squinting in the sun
When you can see again, you're looking down a gun
Would it, you know it, it happened again
Wouldn't you know it, I thought we were friends
Wouldn't you know it, I played it just so
Wouldn't you know it, I just had to go
You spot him standing there, tall, dark and cool
He shows you some white powder and says meet me by the pool
Why not just try it, fit into the group group
Your mind's on fire, will it throw you for a loop
He never do this, it's a one time caprice
But just as you take over he says he's the police
Wouldn't you know it, it happened again
Wouldn't you know it, I thought we were friends
Wouldn't you know it, I played it just so
Wouldn't you know it, I just had to go
It's all around you, it's going to get worse
Your time is dreadful, it seems so perverse
Life is so maddening, you try to break free
But wouldn't you know it, it's happening to me
It's always out there, hanging like a presence
Screwing up your tempo, feeling like a menace
My timing is dreadful, it's so perverse
But it always stays with me, just like I've been cursed
Wouldn't you know it, it's happening
Wouldn't you know it, it had to get worse
Wouldn't you know it, it feels so perverse
Life is so maddening, it just seems a curse
Wouldn't you know it, wouldn't you know it
Wouldn't you know it, it happened again
Wouldn't you know it, I thought we were friends
Wouldn't you know it, I played it just so
Wouldn't you know it, I just had to go
Wouldn't you know it, it happened again
Wouldn't you know it, I thought we were friends
Wouldn't you know it, I played it just so
Wouldn't you know it, I just had to Go
Wouldn't you know it, it happened again
Wouldn't you know it, I thought we were friends
Wouldn't you know it, I played it just so
Wouldn't you know it, I just had to go
