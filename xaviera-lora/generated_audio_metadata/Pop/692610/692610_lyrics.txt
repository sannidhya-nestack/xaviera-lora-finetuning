We're made of plastic, but we're still kind of human
And I'm still kind of selfish, I'm just waiting to be saved, oh
No, I'm not smiling for my health, I'm just looking for my wealth
Stealing kisses from the boys downtown, oh
Don't be afraid to tell me I'm crazy
Running down the street, it's a little bit hazy
Smoking on that good shit, don't know if you knew this
I'm just a little bit clueless
You're with the right team, black jeans, big dreams
Cool shades, green shit, I don't know if you knew this baby
But maybe you're just a little bit clueless
You're just a little bit clueless
You're just a little bit clueless but
You make it look so easy
Shining so everyone can see
You make it look so simple
Please tell me who you're trying to be
We drive in circles with kids that don't know how to behave
Give the illusion of fun and let's pretend that we're brave
And I keep hoping for the best but I'm getting the worst
And maybe someday soon you'll put me first
Spend your time drinking whiskey from the bottle
Didn't pay a cent, but you're going full throttle
And you keep lying just to keep the picture perfect
But behind the frame, you didn't earn it
You didn't earn it
You didn't earn it but
You make it look so easy
Shining so everyone can see
You make it look so simple
Please tell me who you're trying to be
You make it look so easy
Shining so everyone can see
You make it look so simple
Please tell me who you're trying to be
