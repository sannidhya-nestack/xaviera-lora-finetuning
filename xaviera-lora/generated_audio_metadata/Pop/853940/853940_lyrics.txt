I gotta keep on moving and I'll keep on moving
And I'll try to understand all my feelings
When I'm regretting the misunderstandings
And I'm growing up while I learn
And the answer is clear to me
So as long as we can
Share the same ground
And oh I won't et
All that we've been through now
And now I see so clearly
For so long as we're friends
We won't see each other anymore
Different faces are we wasting our words away
For a worthless case but life taught me to believe
In everything I feel no lies
I can take the risk I know
And the answers are clear to me
I know that we can share the same ground
No I won't et
All that we've been through now I
And now I see so clearly
So long as we're friends
We won't see each other
I'll et
Believe that I am here
Deep inside you said you're so close
But that's no meaning, there's nothing you can do
Because I won't turn back
To all that we've been through now I
Now I'm letting go
So as long as we're friends
And oh I won't et
All that we've been through now I
And now I see
So clearly
So as long as we're friends
We won't see each other anymore
