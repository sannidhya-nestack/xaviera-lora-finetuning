Someone's blue jades woke me with their squawking again
Like an old friend I've not seen since my time began
On these starry sands of this stony land I dream of waves
We'll raise the dead flag for the winds are too high today
And the full moon calls the tides
To dance and sway
How she pulls so strong
Moon, moon, moon, is it too soon
For you to take this child home
I don't wanna die trying to talk with angels
Blow a modest choke
Mourning doves who pray for calmer days
Sound the sad decay
Of blistering wars that scar and fray
More than blessed hands
Turning over strands of some ancient pain
Like smiling summer trees
With their laughing leaves break night's cold cage
Above the furrowed lands she'll find a wedding
Banned from her promised stage
How she pulls so strong
Moon moon moon is it too soon?
For you to take this child home
I don't wanna die trying to talk with angels
Still it's wartime
And we are found along the way
But what a price we have to pay
Just to sing our song
Moon, moon, moon, is it too soon
For you to take this child home
I don't wanna die trying to talk with angels
Ooh, ooh
