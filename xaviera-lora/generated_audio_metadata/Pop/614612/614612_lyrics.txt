Well, I'm flying to California, yes, I'm flying to California
Oh, how I've been longing for today
I'm flying to California, yes, I'm flying to California
Well, I can hardly wait'til touchdown in L .A., so now I'm on my way
On this perfect day
For California dreaming of my baby far away
Don't hold me back
I've got to run
I'm gonna feel the California rays of morning sun
By the California
So I'm flying to California, I'm flying to California
Oh how I've been longing for today
And now I'm on my way
On this perfect day
For California dreaming of my baby far away
Don't hold me back
I've got to run
I just wanna be in that place under the sun
I just wanna be in that place under the sun
