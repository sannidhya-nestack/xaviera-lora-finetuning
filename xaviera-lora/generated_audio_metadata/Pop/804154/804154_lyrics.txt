You light up like the stars in the sky
And when we touch you come to life
And all we need is love, love, love
And all we need is love, love
Don't leave me
Don't leave me alone, I won't survive
Don't leave me alone, defend my life
I need love, I need love
I need love, I need love
I need love tonight
I need love tonight
You light up like the stars in the sky
And when we touch you come to life
And all we need is love, love, love
And all we need is love, love
And I just wanna feel like I'm gonna be here tonight
When all the lights come up and it's just you and I
And don't leave me
Don't leave me alone, I won't survive
Don't leave me alone, defend my life
I need love, I need love
I need love, I need love
I need love tonight
I need love tonight
I need love tonight
