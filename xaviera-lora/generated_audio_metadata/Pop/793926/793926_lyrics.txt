Love is wherever it finds you
A highway at midnight or a subway at dawn
Don't you remember how the stars lit up the sky
It was a supernova
Brilliant like the light when stars collide
And now my heart doesn't need a four-leaf clover
good luck
He has arrived, supernova, supernova, supernova
Love is wherever it finds you
Close as tomorrow or as far as yesterday, hey hey
Love is wherever it finds you
A church in the city or a sidewalk cafe
Don't you remember how the stars lit up the sky?
When we met it was a supernova
Brilliant like the light when stars collide
And now my heart doesn't have to be a rover
I know I finally arrived
Supernova, supernova, supernova
