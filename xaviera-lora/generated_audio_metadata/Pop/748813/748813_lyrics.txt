Time to go
It's time to go
Whatever this means
He's happy it seems
After the night
In boundless night
He calls my name
I do the same, so I'll be a fleeting sound
A light ray out on the water
And I'll know his secret name
And tell him about the night time
After this, a simple kiss
Return my eyes, a true disguise
The gentle accent moves me forward
With secrets that I know were true
So I'll be a fleeting sound
A light ray out on the water
And I'll know his secret name and tell him about the night time
So I'll be a freedom sound, a light lay out on the water
And I'll know his secret name and tell him about the night time
