When we are together I live in fear
But dare to dream this
Can last forever
Only above the shaky ground
When the storm attacks
Then bury your heart in my open arms
If we fall through the cracks
Next man, lost and lonely, lover, what's next?
Will there be another day or night of discovery?
As the sun shines and settles down
Can we, oh can we watch a mist?
We catch our breath and whisper secrets
All already spoken
We hold on for love, there ain't enough iron
Echoes can't be broken
What's next my lost and lonely lover oh
What's next?
There'll be another day or night of discovery
As the sun shines and settles down
Can we? Who can?
With what's next?
If we follow the trail of our fleeting light
We can catch it before it disappears in the night
