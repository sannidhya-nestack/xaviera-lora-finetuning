When will it be my turn?
In a world that runs on such confused ideas
When the competition, competition, competition wins
Why do I try
In your world
Why do I try
Repetition, repetition, repetition is
Repetition, repetition, repetition always ends
Lost, never known
Lost in the know
Why do you try
And why
Why are you surprised?
When the competition, competition, competition wins
The competition, competition, competition always wins
Lost in the now
Lost in the now
Needing nothing ever felt so hard
Needing nothing ever felt so hard
Competition, competition, competition always wins
