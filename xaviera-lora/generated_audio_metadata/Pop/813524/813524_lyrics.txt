It's your turn, shuffle and deal look good
And is ever so rare, so play your poor hand well
Today is a game of chess, take heart and happenstance
Take heart and play like hell when you lay down your cards
Play like hell
Let down your guard
And play, and play, and play
Some may not play fair
Don't despair, don't sweat the small stuff
You can always call their bluff
when you play by the rules
When it's your turn you'll be the one to beat
I've no need to cheat
When you lay down your cards
Let down your guard and play, just play
life's a fine, fine game
And it's a fine, fine time to ante up
Call that Trump shuffle and deal
Play and play if nothing else
Play for fun, play
