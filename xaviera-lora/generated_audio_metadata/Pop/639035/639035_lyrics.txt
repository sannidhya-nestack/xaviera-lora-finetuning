Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm
I can see the times are changing
And I know it's in our hands
Looking for a destination
Destination is the promised land
All around these walls are crumbling
Every day we hide our tears
People want to find an answer
And the answer is plain and clear
Oh, I'm still a believer
Oh, yes I am
And oh, I'll keep on reaching
For that promised land
I can feel there's trouble coming
Find a way, don't light the fuse
This is real, so no more playing
I'll be fighting to break on through
Many roads have led to nowhere
All those dreams and wasted plans
Looking for some inspiration
Inspiration in the promised land
And now
I'm still a believer, oh, yes I am, and oh, I'll keep on searching for that promised land, oh
Find that promised land, a land, a land, a land
I'm still a believer
Yes, I am, and I'll keep on reaching for the promised land
Oh, find the promised land, oh, find the promised land, oh, oh
