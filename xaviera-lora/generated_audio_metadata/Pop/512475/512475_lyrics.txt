I need to let go of some things
I need to et everything
I need to let go and let some light in
Some things I'll try to ignore
Some days I'll fall to the floor
But I'll get by and I'll fight through it all
You pick me up when I'm in pieces on the ground
You lift me up, give me a reason to be found
I don't know who I am, how to be anymore
I don't know how to feel, how to breathe like before
I need to hide
Need to let go
I need to learn to trust again
I need to let you be my friend
et the past
And find myself and then
You will give me strength I know
Make you proud now even though
It may take some time but I won't be thrown
Now that you see me for who I really am
You can release me and let me start again
I don't know who I am
I don't know how to feel, how to breathe like before
I need to, I need to let go
I keep wanting to feel alive
Keep wondering what it's like
To live, to be and breathe, you're with me
You're with me
I don't know who I am, how to be anymore
I don't know how to feel, how to breathe
I don't know who I am, how to be anymore
I don't know how to feel, how to breathe (yeah)
I don't know (I don't know)
I need to let go (I need to let go)
I don't know who I am, how to be who I am (I don't know who I am, how to be who I am)
I don't know how to feel, how to breathe like before (I don't know who I am, how to feel, how to breathe like before)
I need to (I need to)
I (I) yeah
