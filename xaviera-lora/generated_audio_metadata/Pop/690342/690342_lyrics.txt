I met pretty wombs just north of Paris, France
I almost died one day but she encouraged me to play
Just give me a chance, a sweet romance
I'll write about love and such things, oh
I met pretty wombs just north of Paris, France
She said to me while sipping hot tea
My life is good if I only could have you it would be ecstasy, ecstasy
We're living good in the all-conscious, you and I
Singing our song, singing our songs
We'll always seem to live that, live that life of ecstasy
Ecstasy on top of our own way
Here's the price of ecstasy, ecstasy
I met pretty woman just north of Paris, France
I almost died one day but she encouraged me to play
I almost climbed the highest mountain I've ever seen
Had to travel round the world, my life unfurled
I met pretty women, girls and all the best friends
She said to me while sipping hot tea
My life is good if I only could
I knew it would be ecstasy, ecstasy
We're living good and the old gone
Just you and I singing our song
Singing our song
We'll always seem to live that
Live that life of ecstasy
Ecstasy
On top of our own rolling hills of pride
Ecstasy, ecstasy
My life is good if I only could have you
It would be ecstasy, ecstasy
With a living good and the old gone
Just you and I singing our song
Singing our song
We'll always sing to live that
Live that life of ecstasy
Ecstasy
On top of our rolling hills of fright
Ecstasy
Ecstasy
Ecstasy
Ecstasy
Ecstasy
Ecstasy
Ecstasy
Anxiety, Anxiety
