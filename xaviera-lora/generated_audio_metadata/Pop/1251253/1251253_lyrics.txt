Sun is shining through the sky
We got no plans just you and I
Laughter echoes in the breeze
Living like we're wild and free
Morning swims on sandy toes
All the joys that summer shows
Ice cream melting in our hands
Watching waves crash on the sands
Summer days with you so fine
Every moment feels divine
Chasing sunsets painting skies
With you by my side it flies
Road trips down those winding lanes
Wind in hair with no restraints
Picnics spread beneath the trees
Sharing dreams just you and me
Starry nights and campfire songs
In your arms is where I belong
Memories in every hue
Summer days so sweet with you
Summer days with you're so fine
Every moment feels divine
Chasing sunsets in the skies
With you by my side it flies, it flies
Story nights and campfire songs
In your arms is where I belong
Memories in every hue
Summer days so sweet with you
Summer days with you so fine
Every moment feels divine
Chasing sunsets, painting skies
With you by my side it flies, it flies
