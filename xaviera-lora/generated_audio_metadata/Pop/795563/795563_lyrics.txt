I'm overpowered
you're under my skin
Like running naked
While being dressed in bliss
Overpowered
Gonna let you in
Underneath these thick walls
Resistance is this
I'm overacting
My heart is thrilled
While I'm on the fire
You might just shoot to kill
In a paradise lost
Winner takes all
Don't run
We strike gold
The deeper we might fall
On high and low
Don't run, we struggle
Kiss by the sun will unfold
Don't run, we struggle
We'll come undone
we found love
This undercurrent of being overjoyed
Had me shocked and stunned
But turn me on
It's not overrated
To have a heart that sings
It'll dance on a wire
For a love that kills
In a paradise lost
Winner takes all
Don't run
We struggle
The deeper we might fall
On higher life
Don't run
We struggle
Kissed by the sun
We'll unfold
Don't run
We struggle
We'll come undone
'Cause we found love overdoing the things we've done
Makes us understand we struggle with finding love
We're staying high
With finding love
We save the light
In a paradise lost
The winner takes all
Don't run
We struggle
The deeper we might fall
In a higher level
Don't run
We struggle
In a paradise lost
The winner takes all
Don't run
We struggle, the deeper we might fall
In higher love, don't run
We struggle, kiss by the sun
Will unfold, don't run
We struggle, we'll come undone
we've found love
