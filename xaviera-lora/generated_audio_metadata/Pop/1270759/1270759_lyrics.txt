I saw your face on my phone screen
A pixelated dream so keen
In digital hands we roll
In cybernetic homes
We share emojis like a code
Feelings lost on the up and low
Messages blink in the blue
Connections made through and through
Internetic you and me
Binary love sets us free
Internetic heart so true
Wifi signals straight to you
Virtual hugs feel the same
Loving hashtags with your name
Your posts light up my day
And in this cybernetic play
Scrolling through your life online
In your status I find some signs
Profile pictures change like tides
But our link it never hides
Internet it you and me
Binary love sets us free
Internet it hearts so true
Wifi signal straight to you
In a netted you and me
Binary love sets us free
In a netted heart so true
Wi-Fi signal straight to you
You, you, you, you, you
Oh, oh, you, you, you, you, you, you
