Follow the river down from the stream
Over the mountains and into the sea
I want to go
Home where that river flows
Let me go
I see an angel spreading her wings
Perfect and graceful, the aura she brings
I want to fly, oh where that angel flies
Let's go tonight
The calm after the storm
Makes me want to
The calm after the storm
Helps me break through
The calm after the storm
That moment when fantasy ruled
Capture the image
A black and white film
A celluloid classic
Both haunting and chill
I want to be oh
In that 40's dream of a movie scene
The calm after the storm makes me want to
The calm after the storm helps me break through
The calm after the storm
A feeling too good
To be true
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The calm after the storm makes me want to
The calm after the storm helps me break
The calm after the storm makes me want to
The calm after the storm, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
A feeling too good to be true
Tell the truth to be true
