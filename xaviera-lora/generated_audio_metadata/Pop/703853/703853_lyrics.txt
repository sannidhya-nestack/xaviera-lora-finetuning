While you're lighting fires
All the pictures that I had inside my head lie undeveloped
Like a roll of film lies undiscovered
While you're lighting fires
While you're lighting fires
While you're lighting fires
When I'm standing near you
I can't get my words out like I fear you
Being in your shadow
How you magnetize
While you're lighting fires
