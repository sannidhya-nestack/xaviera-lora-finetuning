Pain never leaves you where it found you
Every smile I see, I see in double
Go ahead now, run for cover, me right away
I'm freezing cold
You know I'm freezing cold
Gave up my seat on the subway
To an old pickpocket just the same
Picked up my girl on lower Broadway
She told me I'm to blame
Go ahead now run for over me right away
Cause I'm freezing cold
You know I'm freezing cold
Aren't you freezing cold
Yeah I'm freezing cold
Every lefty I know is a fascist
Every righty I know would steal your cane
I heard there's trouble down on Day Street
Who cares, put your hand out and look away
Go ahead now run for cover me right away
Cause I'm freezing cold
Yeah I'm freezing cold
You know I'm freezing cold
Yeah I'm freezing cold
Ooh, ooh, ooh
