I hear you calling out from the darkness (from the darkness)
I hear you calling out from the darkness (from the darkness)
I hear you calling out from the darkness (we need you, we need you)
I'm coming back from the dead
Walking down the street you live
Taking the chance you will be home
It's been so long since our last kiss
Can't do this on my own
I need you to breathe
Bring me back to life
My heart needs you to beat
Save me from the light
Don't let me fly away
Don't let me flatline
Don't let me flatline
Don't let me flatline
Don't let me flatline
I've been so reckless with hearts
All I cared about was my own
I would die to get back the sparks
I'll never let you go
I need you to breathe
Bring me back to life, my heart needs you to be
Save me from the light, don't let me fly a line
Don't let me fly a line
Don't let me fly a line
Don't let me fly a line
Don't let me fly away
I hear you calling out from the darkness
I'm coming back from the dead
I hear you calling out from the darkness
I'm coming back from the dead
I need you to breathe
I need you to breathe
I need you to breathe
Bring me back to life
My heart needs you to beat, oh
To save me from the light
Don't let me flatline
Don't let me flatline
Don't let me flatline
Don't let me flatline
Don't let me flatline
