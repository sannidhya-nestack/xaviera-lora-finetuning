I'm a little butterfly
And you're cruel and soon I'll die
It's my destiny I know
There's no way for me to go
The silence is just killing me
I beg you to set me free
Two months in this void
No one can stay here anymore
But everything is in his will
All this meat collected here
Says he loves me tenderly
But his plans are no more to me
The most atrocious thing is that
People don't know anything
They don't know if I'm alive or whether I'm dead
Mother, don't you cry all night
Father, don't you cry all night
There's a fire in my soul
In your soul I'll burn a hole
But everything is in his will
Oh, this mad collector, he
Says he loves me tenderly
But it's been the normal day
But everything is in his will
Of this mad collector he
Says he loves me tenderly
But his plans are normal too
In normal
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
