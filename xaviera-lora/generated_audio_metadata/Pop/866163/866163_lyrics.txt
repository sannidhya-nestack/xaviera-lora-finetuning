Kosher on the beat
Tell me what you want, tell me what you really want
I can be your light that shines in the dark
Tell me what you need, tell me what you really need
I can be your rhythm when you move to that beat
Oh, your love is my devotion
Oh, for your love I'll cross the ocean
Oh, your love is my devotion
Ain't it crazy how I feel
Every time I think of you
You make my heart wanna melt
It is crazy
And I've shown you all the signs
That I wanna be with you
Baby come and know my world
But maybe
You're too scared I'm gonna give up
But I'll never ever do that
Don't you listen to the rumor please
Save me
Save me from me
Cause it's me that I fear
And it's you that I need
I've been trying to reach you for a while now
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Baby girl you can come around right now
If I come around, will it be alright?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Baby girl, you can come around right now
Tell me what you want, tell me what you really want
I can be your light that shines in the dark
Tell me what you need, tell me what you really need
I can be your rhythm when you move to that beat oh
Your love is my devotion, oh-oh-oh
For your love I'll cross the ocean, oh-oh-oh
Your love is my devotion, oh-oh-ooh
Operation girl you opened up my heart
I've been patient but I'm bout to fall apart
Let's talk about it you ain't read none of my chats
I guess I know you scared but I need another chance look
This is the 99th time that I'm begging
To keep it 100 that's a lot to be wasting
I'm not a quitter and I'm never gonna give up next time
Your phone ring I hope you gonna pick up
Remember those times that we kissed in the rain
And the moments that we cared for each other with no pain
Used to pull up at your house and your mother used to hate
We tell her we about to do it again (Yas)
I've been tryna reach you for a while now
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Baby girl you can come around right now
If I come around, will it be alright? (It'll be alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright)
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright (It's alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright)
Let me go, you can come around right now
Tell me what you want, tell me what you really want
I can be your light that shines in the dark
Tell me what you need, tell me what you really need
I can be your rhythm when you move to that beat, oh
Your love is my devotion, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
For your love I'll cross the ocean, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Your love is my devotion, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
