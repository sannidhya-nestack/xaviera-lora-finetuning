Under pressure, no more time
Can we make a move?
Overthinking, you and I
What do we have to lose?
Cause I'm wasting all my time
Thinking of the things we could do
If you gave me one more sign
I could find a way to break through
A way to break through
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
A way to break through
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
A way to break through
Under pressure, no more time
Can we make a move?
Overthinking, you and I
What do we have to lose?
Cause I'm wasting all my time
Thinking of the things we could do
If you gave me one more sign
I could find a way to break through
A way to break through
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
A way to break through
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
A way to break through
If you gave me one more sign
I could find a way to break through
A way to break through
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, a way to break through
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, a way to break through
