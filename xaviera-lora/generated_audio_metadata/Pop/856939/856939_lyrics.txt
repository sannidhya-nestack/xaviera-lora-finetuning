Why'd you leave me? I got to know
So tell me, then just go
Don't look back, won't see me no more
This last time just tell me, don't say no
I will walk you to that door
I will even drive you home
I need to know why you walked out of my life before
I gave you all that I had
You left me so empty all alone
This last one time be nice make peace
Not like a war zone tell me now
Why'd you hurt me?
Just please don't lie
Just tell me, tell me why
Tell the truth, look me in the eyes
This last time just tell me I won't cry
I will walk you to the door
I will even drive you home
I need to know why you walked out of my life before
I gave you all that I had
You left me so empty all alone
This last one time be nice, make peace
Not like a war zone, tell me now
I will walk you to the door
I will even drive you home
I need to know why you walked out of my life before
