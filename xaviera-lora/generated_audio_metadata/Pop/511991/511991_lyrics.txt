I remember the day we met
A million years and I won't et
I didn't know your name yet
When I looked into your eyes
All at once my heart had wings
I never thought in my wildest dreams
That I would one day find these things
But what we had has died
Here we are
It doesn't matter who's to blame
This is our last goodbye
We did the best we could
God knows who we tried
If I could change things baby I would
So dry your eyes
we both know
This is our last goodbye
Another place and another time
The music plays and the words all rhyme
And everything works out just right
And we're back in love again
But all too quickly those dreams, they fade
It's too much now, the price we've paid
The time has come to turn the page
And let the story end here
And no one is to blame
This is our last goodbye
We did the best we could
God knows we tried
If I could change things, baby, I would
So dry your eyes
we both know
Goodbye to all the things we tried so hard to hold close
They slip away and disappear like ghosts
This is our last goodbye
Mmm, and I'm dying inside
Ooh, God knows we tried
But baby, we know it's the last goodbye
Goodbye
