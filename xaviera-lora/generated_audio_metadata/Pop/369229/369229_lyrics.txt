I'm all alone, I'm on my own
I'm all alone, I'm on my own
I'm trying to find my way back home
I'm all alone, I'm on my own
There's a paradise in our hearts
We can't touch with our hands
Try to grasp it, it falls like you clutching the sand
To close your eyes, capture the thought
To live into it land
For our souls, soul, the heavens and our hearts understand
Essence of man
The reason we have these wings that flap
But don't lift us up from the land
There must be a plan
There's a reason I know
To bestow us with wings
When we're still stuck here below
We're stuck in the snow
Like a truck with a load that groans
Under the weight that won't leave it alone
The goldfish overgrown
Gave the sea for a boat on your own
But still unwilling to be overthrown
Don't let go
Though the truth's loud in your ears
You ignore your mountain of fear
it's drummed up, I'll bear your cheer
But crave home as the years disappear
Not dying, not flying, just a fountain of tears
There's something on my mind
Something I can't describe
Something I'm trying to find
On the inside
I want much more than nice
A life within limits
A life that's predictable from start to finish
A life that's bounded by boundaries
Binding your image with visions and dreams
Drop down, dodge, drown, diminish
I want much more than a generation of whiners
Miners who sing their songs solo and minor
A generation of ever empty hearts hold at the base
The flow of life can be traced from spoons for a coffee grinder
I want much more than the American dream
Though the ideal seems ideal
Please believe if it were deemed
Enough there wouldn't be so many
Broken hearts, souls, households and families
I want more than a skeleton in a red summer dress
Chasing what is already taken by something less
I want more than scarlet scars on blood red
This blood shed that we call love
If it is I'm sick of love then
There's something on my mind
Something I can't describe
Something I'm trying to find
On the inside
But it's not there
I'm lost on the road
But I know that you are watching out
By my cross it grows old
And I'm falling down
I've lost all control
Now you're cold
I'm desperately in doubt
What's the cost of my soul
It's calling out
I've lost all control, now you're cold
I'm desperately in doubt
What's the cost of my soul is calling out
I'm all alone, I'm on my own
I'm all alone, I'm on my own
I'm trying to find my way back home
I'm all alone, I'm on my own
