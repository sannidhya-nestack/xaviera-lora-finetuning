Sunrise in your eyes
One heart in the skies
Morning starts anew
I feel so at home with you
Coffee brewing slow
Laughter's all we know
Every day's a view
I feel so at home with you
Where you are is where I wanna be
You and me it's all I need to see
Every moment true
I feel at home with you
Stars light up the night
Hold me in your sight
Never feeling blue
I feel at home with you
Where you are is where I wanna be
You and me it's all I need to see
Every moment true I feel at home with you
Coffee brewing slow laughter's all we know
Every day's a view I feel so at home with you
Where you are is where I wanna be
You and me, it's all I need to see
Every moment true, I feel at home with you
