Why do I always have to open my eyes
So many things to see that just make you cry
Excuse me mister can you give me a dollar
I'm hungry
I really need to get me something to eat
Don't even have the strength to stand on my feet
I know you see me though you act like you can
I may be harmless but I'm your fellow man
Don't leave me here on the outside
I don't wanna see who I am
Don't leave me here on the outside
I don't wanna see who I am
Don't leave me here on the outside
I don't wanna see who I am
Don't leave me here on the outside
I don't wanna see who I am
A broken artist with the stack in his hand
The photocopies of a one night stand
Hey passing stranger can you give me a minute of your time
I dedicated my whole life to this show
I only need a hundred people to go
And maybe you could bring a couple of friends
If I don't back the house this could be the end
Don't leave me here on the outside
I don't wanna see who I am
Don't leave me here on the outside
I don't wanna see who I am
Don't leave me here on the outside
I don't wanna see who I am
Don't leave me here on the outside
I don't wanna see who I am
Pretty lady with her nose in the air
Just walking by without the slightest of care
Pardon me miss but I would really like the chance to know you
Perhaps you'd like the chance to get to know me
Maybe the weekend if your schedule is free
Hey wait a minute don't you see that I'm here
There isn't any need to be so severe
Don't leave me here on the outside
I don't wanna see who I am
Don't leave me here on the outside
I don't wanna see who I am
Don't leave me here on the outside
I don't wanna see who I am
Don't leave me here on the outside
I don't wanna see who I am
