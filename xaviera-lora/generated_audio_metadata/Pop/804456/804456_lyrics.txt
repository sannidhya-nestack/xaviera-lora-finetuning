Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yes, you talk the talk
But you don't really walk the walk
And this world
Full of face
You fit right in
Life's been maybe
Not so well
But you are lazy but
Oh well
You know you have something
Coming your way
One day I will stand up to you
And have revenge, revenge
All I really want is my revenge, revenge
All I really want is my revenge
Yes you speak the words
But you don't really mean them
Black on eggshells around you
Oh,'cause you're moody too
Life's been maybe hard on you
But you've got one person to blame
And that's you
You know you have something coming your way
One day I will stand up to you
And have revenge, revenge
All I really want is my revenge, revenge
All I really want
It's not that I'm sayin' that you coulda, woulda, shoulda
It's not that I'm sayin' you're the top notch guy
It's not that I'm sayin' that you never lied to me, you did
Revenge,'cause you know you have something comin' your way
One day I will stand up to you
And have revenge, revenge
All I really want is my revenge, revenge
All I really want
I'm gonna be stupid
I'm gonna be mean
I'm gonna be everything in between
I'm gonna say "not really"
I'm gonna sing loud and be proud
Revenge
I'm gonna be everything that you didn't want from me
Revenge, revenge, revenge, revenge, revenge
