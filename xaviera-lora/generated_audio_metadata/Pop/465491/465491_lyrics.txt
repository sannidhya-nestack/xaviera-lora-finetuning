A breezy morning bathed in pastel light
The fluffy clouds raise home and it's like
The love kite's taking us far into the sky
The love kite's flying us higher in the sky
A rain-drenched window in the afternoon
Wash-lined clothes flapping cheerfully
The love kite's taking us far into the sky
The love kite's flying us higher in the sky
Warm tones of sunset and it's twilight
Birds raise home to bed and it's light
The love kite's taking us far into the sky
The love kite's flying us higher in the sky
Stars under the blanket of night
A dream tumbling in lazy flight
The love kite's taking us far into the sky
The love kite's flying us high up in the sky
The love kite's taking us far into the sky
The love kite's flying us higher in the sky
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
