Day after day I dream about you
I get lost in the clouds and I melt when you move
When I think about you my breath starts to race
And a rainbow of colors dance on my face
But no matter how hard I try
I can't get you to catch my eyes
Am I invisible? (Am I invisible?)
Just like the air (Just like the air)
A breath on the window
That soon disappears
My heart silently stops
'Cause I'd give up all that I've got for your love
Am I invisible?
You float next to me like a river of wind
And I am frozen by the warmth of your skin
But you look through me
Like I am a ghost, part of the sea and that you don't notice
my smile doesn't get you to stay
I can't get you to look my way
Am I invisible? (Am I invisible?)
Just like the air (Just like the air)
A breath on the window
That soon disappears
My heart silently stops
'Cause I'd give up all that I've got for your love
Am I invisible?
Then one day by chance we are both eye to eye
You start to smile and I start to fly
But my tears fall when I see you're not smiling at me
My heart silently stops
'Cause I'd give up all that I've got for your love
Am I invisible? (Am I invisible?)
Nothing but air (Nothing but air)
A breath on the window that just disappears
My heart silently stops
'Cause I'd give up all that I've got
But I am invisible
