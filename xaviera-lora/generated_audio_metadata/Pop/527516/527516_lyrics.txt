Can't get you out of my head, out of my head
So tired but I'll sleep when I'm dead, sleep when I'm dead
Bipolar thoughts are breezing through my mind, unset
On an endorphin collision ahead
Try to remember what you said or what you said
My belly button tingles instead, so I won't et
Let my heart and my head speak a different dialect
Like friendly fire in my bed
Oh-oh (oh-oh)
Won't you give me just a spoiler alert?
Oh-oh (oh-oh)
I need to know your casual flirt
Will make my apple disturb
Oh-oh (oh-oh)
I'm just begging for a spoiler alert
If I could only never get hurt
From the preview out of your shirt
I would feel frequently frantic
Over romantic, melodramatic, psychopathic by you
It's not the script that I read, in case we met
Impulsive actions, not my best bet, hasn't helped me yet
If the girl meets a boy, scene would be so complex, I wouldn't audition for that
But you didn't seem to feel this threat, did it make you sweat?
We looked like Angelina and Brad, blonde and brunette
The spark in your eyes gave me fever in this dumb show duet
Or was it fire and et
Won't you give me just a spoiler alert?
Oh-oh-oh,'cause I need to know if your casual flirt
Will make my heart feel disturbed
Oh-oh-oh, I'm just begging for your spoiler alert
If I could only never get hurt from the preview out of your shirt
I wouldn't feel freakily frantic, over-romantic, melodramatic, psychopathic, but you
If I could read your mind, alright (ooh ooh ooh)
I wouldn't act dumb cool (act dumb cool)
If I could read the signs, alright (ooh ooh ooh)
I won't feel like a fool (like a fool)
If I know how to place my bet on your number of days through, yeah
I wouldn't feel so prickly, frantic, over-romantic, melodramatic, psychopathic from you, no
Won't you give me just a spoiler alert?
Oh, oh,'cause I need to know if your casual flirt
Will make my heart feel disturbed
Oh, oh, won't you give me just a spoiler alert
Uh oh,'cause I need to know if your casual flirt will make my heart feel disturbed, won't you give me
Won't you give me just a spoiler alert, a spoiler alert, uh oh,'cause I need to know if your causal flirt will make my heart feel disturbed, disturbed, yeah
I'm just begging for a spoiler alert, spoiler alert
If I did all I'd do I'd get air from the preview of your shirt
I wouldn't feel frickly frantic over romantic, melodramatic, psychopathic, but you!
