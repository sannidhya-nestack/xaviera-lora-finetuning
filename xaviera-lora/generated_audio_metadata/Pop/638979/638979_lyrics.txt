Taking a ride down Bourbon Street
Crowds pushing and shoving in the city
There's a sense of excitement, watch it come alive
In Technicolor neon, an explosion of light
Dixieland blues, Creol rhythm fills the air
Sights and those sounds you just won't find anywhere
Doors open wide, anything your heart desires
Bars and the strip clubs
Where temptation lights the fire
The fun never stops
On Bourbon Street
Beer at Four Dollars
Blowing like a string
Hurricane cocktail
Pat O'Brien's feel the mood
Down from Canal Street, Esplanade Avenue, Dixieland Blues, Creole rhythm fills the air, sights and the sounds you just won't find anywhere else
Doors open wide in the heart of New Orleans
Coming alive down Bourbon Street
Bourbon Street
I'll move on
Dixieland blues, Creole rhythm fills the air
Sights and those sounds you just won't find anywhere
Doors open wide in the heart of New Orleans, oh
Coming alive down Bourbon, Bourbon Street, oh, oh, oh
Takin' a ride down Bourbon Street
Takin' a ride down Bourbon Street
