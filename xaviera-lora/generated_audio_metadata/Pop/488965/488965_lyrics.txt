Take the back road through the valley to your sunny day
She will be with you tonight under clearer skies
Does she thrill you honey fill you till you're feeling fine
While you try her on for size
I'll be standing by
Take the back road through the valley where you'll find your sunny day
She will be with you tonight under clearer skies
I can outrun the rain
Till I see you again
I can outrun the rain
She can touch you
But it's only temporary high
Her emotions, paper thin, will only tear in time
Take the back road
Through the valley where you
Find your sunny day
She will be with you tonight
Under clearer skies
I can outrun the rain
'Til I see you again
I can now run the race
Take the back road through the valley where you find your sunny day
She will be with you tonight under clearer skies
Take the back road through the valley where you'll find your sunny day
She will be with you tonight under clearer skies
I can outrun the rain
I can outrun the rain
