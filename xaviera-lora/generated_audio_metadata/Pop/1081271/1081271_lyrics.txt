The roads long are so it seems
Every mile's full of internet memes
I look out of the window, breathe full of dreams
Never wish to be away, it hurts my soul seems
It's sunny where you are
The clouds just make the light flower
It's sunny where you are
The rains just make the rainbow fuller
The drive's never ending, or so I fear
Every toll gate takes such a deal of time
When all I need is you, that's what's real
I need to soak up the sunshine and heal
Sunny where you are
The clouds just make the light flower
It's sunny where you are
The rains just make the rainbow fuller
Being patient was not my way
Tapping my fingers on the tray
I just say come what may
I'm headed into your zone and your day
It's sunny where you are
The clouds just make the light flower
It's sunny where you are
The rains just make the rainbow fuller
It's sunny where you are
The clouds just make the light flower
It's sunny where you are
The rains just make the rainbow fuller
Sunny where you are
Sunny where you are
