Come on and live for the night, feel alive
Surrounded by sounds that reach the sky
Come on and move through the waves, feel the height
And we are united
We live for the night to see the stars collide
Follow the sound waves and we will rise
Sing for the night, come on and feel alive
And we are united
And we are united
Feel alive
And we are united
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on and sing to the night, we will rise
Follow the sound that gives us life
Come on and move through the air, we will fly
And we are united
We live for the night to see the stars collide
Follow the sound waves and we will rise
Sing for the night, come on and feel alive
And we are united
(Come on)
