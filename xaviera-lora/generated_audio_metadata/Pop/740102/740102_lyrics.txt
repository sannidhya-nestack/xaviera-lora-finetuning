It's just another night
Wanna go for a ride
Only I can do it right for you
You wanna come inside
Don't make this harder
You gotta give me more
I don't wanna be your one night lady
I heard you've been around
So tell me who love you now
Who loving you now
Tell me baby where you been baby
Who loving you now
Who loving you now
Tell me baby where you been baby
Didn't mean to get so deep
Guess I don't
Really know me
You know I feel you here
Right next to me
It just gets to me
You're all I'm looking for
You're all I'm looking for
Who loving you now
Who loving you now
Tell me baby where you been lately
Who loving you now?
Who loving you now?
Tell me baby where you've been lately?
I'm all alone in your heart
I know you're hurting now
Who's loving you now?
Who's loving you now?
Now
Who's loving you now? (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
You're loving enough, you're loving enough for me, baby, where you been, baby?
You're loving enough, you're loving enough for me, baby, where you been, baby?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
