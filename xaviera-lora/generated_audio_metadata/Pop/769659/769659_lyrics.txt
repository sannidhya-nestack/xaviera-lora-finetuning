Shining bright, bright and true all day and night
All our hands keeping us standing
The earth and flowers adorning our lives
Every once in a while I
Reminisce back in time
Always there, you chase away
Cloudy days and nightmares
Everyone from our mothers, our wives, our sisters, just to name a few
They are deep in our hearts and won't ever be apart, no, no
(No sweet love)
The infinite love (No sweet love)
Never ending love'til the end of life
Gonna love you and miss you and hug you
It goes on and on (No sweet love)
We won't be lost, we are so loved for every breath
And I'll take you in my arms
You changed one way to stay
Written in my heart a word to say
When it was cold and I was lost
You came to me and gave me love
I look at you and see myself
The light you spread is always there
So I can find my way back home
Keep me away from any storm
Cloudy days are washed away
You gave me strength to find a way
Look at me inside my heart
Even if distant hairs is apart
You'll always be here by my side
Your laugh will always be my guide
My memories inside my soul
For the women that will laugh
Oh, oh, friends
Two fathers and friends
You two always keep us dead
Only this song for you is not meant, ooh
And every step in my life I
Sometimes fall, feeling
Who is there? You took my hands, hold me up, make me stand
Everyone from our ends, our grandmas, our daughters, naming another few
Who they are deep in our hearts and won't ever be apart
No no no (Papa, papa, papa)
Those we love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love (love, love, sweet love)
We are so loved for every breath that I'll take you
In love, sweet love, infinite love
Love, sweet love, we are so in love
For every breath and I'll take you in my arms
And I'll take you in
And I'll take you in my arms
