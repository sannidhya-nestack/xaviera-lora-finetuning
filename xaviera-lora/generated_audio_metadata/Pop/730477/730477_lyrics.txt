I'd drive a million miles tonight
To simply find and touch your skin
You're all I've ever known that's right
And I've been places no one's been
You're a light in this deep darkness
That surrounds me, hoping I'll give in
But you're the diamond that I miss
And I won't stop until you're found again
When I find you, I will hold you
I will love you through an endless dream
When together, we'll remember
That alone our two hearts bleed
Alone our two hearts bleed
That horizon in the distance
Calls to me and whispers you're still there
In the quiet of this instance
All I feel is me buried in your hair
All the quiet nights await us
And leaves us nothing left to dare
Now I'm driving with just one wish
Let me fall into your arms and breathe your air
When I find you, I will hold you
I will love you through an endless dream
When together, we'll remember that alone our two hearts bleed
There's no detour, there's no red light
No, there is nothing stopping me
You're what I'm for through this midnight
You're all I want to see
When I find you, I will hold you
I will love you through an endless dream
When together, we'll remember
That alone our two hearts bleed
When I find you I will hold you
I will love you through an endless dream
When together we'll remember
That alone our two hearts bleed
Alone our two hearts bleed
Alone our two hearts bleed
