You were in the dark, you were cursing at something
I was on the floor staring up at nothing
You were in the car with the headlights glowing
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Dead end, what do we do?
The sound is out, I'm on the view
Dead end, what do we say?
With all the rules, the wrong way
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
Is burn, burn, burn, burn, burn with you
All I wanna do, all I wanna do is burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
I was in the dark when you called me like a ray of fire
Back to the wall, hands on my neck, I think
I could be a ghost in the headlights glowing
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Dead end, what do we do?
The sound is out, I'm on the view
Dead end, what do we say?
We've all gone off the wrong way
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
Is go on, go on, go on, go on, go on the view
All I wanna do, all I wanna do is burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
Is burn, burn, burn, burn, burn with you
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
Is burn, burn, burn, burn, is burn, burn
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
Is burn, burn, burn, burn, burn with you
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
It's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
