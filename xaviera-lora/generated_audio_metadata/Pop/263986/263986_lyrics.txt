Sitting here, doing fine, playing my music all the time
The sun is shining almost everyday
And I'm too scared to walk your way
My head is bobbing, my heart is throbbing
I don't know if I can take this anymore
I wanna look into your eyes
Wanna feel time slip and slide
Wanna hold your hand and let you know
I'm your man
Ba ba do ba ba do do do do
Ba ba do do de
Bo bo ba bo bo
Ba ba bo bo ba bo ba bo
Ba da do ba ba do do do
Ba ba do do de
Bo bo ba bo bo
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ooh, I just wanna spend some time with you
Have you listen to my rhyme
I wanna do the little things that make you smile all the time
Feel so free now baby, I wanna make you mine
Want to, need to, spend some time with you
Want to, need to
Spend some time with you
I'm talkin'bout you, I'm talkin'bout me
In the sunshine, yeah
Now I know that I can make you so happy
And I know that you make me so free
There's no hurry
I don't want you to worry
I'll be right here
All the time
A-boo-doo-doo-doo
A-doo-doo-doo-ba-doon
A-boo-ba-ba-doon
Ba-ba-ba-bum-boom-boom
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ma ma ma
I wanna spend some time, spend some time, spend some time, spend some time
Want to, need to, spend some
Spend some time with you
Want to, need to, spend some time with you
