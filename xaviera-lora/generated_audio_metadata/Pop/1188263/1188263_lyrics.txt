Oh, oh, oh, oh
What I crave is a guiding force
Someone keeping my dreams on course
And going the distance like a champion racehorse
Silently brave
What I crave is a self-made man who is not afraid to dirty his hands
And who is born to please the woman I am at the end of a long, long day
That's what I crave, yeah, what I crave
What I crave, that's what I crave
Every day, every day
I see devotion as deep as the ocean
As wide as the universe
Yes, I'm waiting with arms wide open
For someone to end my search
What I crave is a heavenly place
Together we'll soar through time and space
With a bond so strong no one can erase
Our emotional tidal wave
That's what I crave, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
What I crave is a self-made man
Who is not afraid to dirty his hands
And who was born to please the woman I am
At the end of a long, long day
What I crave is a guiding force
Someone, someone keeping my dreams on course
And going the distance like a champion racehorse
Silently brave
That's what I crave, yeah
That's what I crave, crave
That's what I crave
Every day, every day, every day
Slightly brave, a big tidal wave
Oh, that's what I crave, what I crave
Oh, that's what I crave
It's what I crave, oh, it's what I crave, ooh, it's what I crave
