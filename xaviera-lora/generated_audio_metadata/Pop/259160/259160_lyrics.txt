I have made up my mind about my life
I'm gonna be a rockstar before I die
Oh no please don't try to stop me
Hot V12 engine ready to hit the street
My motor is running
My motor is running
Take me to where I wanna be
Take me to where I gotta be
Sometimes the road is rough and hard
And sometimes you could only move so far
You could only move so far
But my tank is filled with hopes and dreams
So I keep on rolling till I find my capital P
Till I find my capital P
My motor is running
My motor is running
Take me to where I wanna be
Take me to where I gotta be
Move in, move in, move in
Move in, move in, move in
Do I see the light?
Do I see the light?
My motor is running
My motor is running
Take me to where I wanna be
It's gonna take me to where I gotta be (where I gotta be, yeah, yeah)
My motor is running (uh-huh, yeah, yeah)
My motor is running (uh-huh, yeah-yeah)
It's gonna take me to where I wanna be (it's gonna take me, yeah, it's gonna take me)
It's gonna take me to where I gotta be
