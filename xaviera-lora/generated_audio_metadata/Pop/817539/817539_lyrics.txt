I'd like to think we'd had it all
If you'd open up and let me fall
But there's no telling what's the truth
When you're so scared of what you'll lose
But tomorrow can come if we don't see the sun
Can't run out of time, we've just begun
I'm crying out loud because I need your love
So take a chance on me tonight
Take a chance on me tonight
I'll be your girl, stick by your side
Don't gotta worry, everything's alright
Take a chance on me tonight
I'd like to think that this was real
The things you'd say to me in ways I'd feel (ways I'd feel)
But there's no truth in what you do
It's all a game I'm bound to lose
But tomorrow can come if we don't see the sun
Can't run out of time, we've just begun
I'm crying out loud because I need your love
So take a chance on me tonight
Take a chance on me tonight
I'll be your girl, stick by your side
Don't gotta worry, everything's alright
Take a chance on me tonight
Take a chance on me tonight
I'll be your girl, stick by your side
Don't gotta worry, everything's alright
Take a chance on me tonight
Rain by rain, I see the signs of time
Slipping through my fingers, but we can't rewind
I'll be the chance you didn't take
Take a chance on me tonight
Take a chance on me tonight
I'll be your girl, stick by your side
Don't gotta worry, everything's alright
Take a chance on me tonight
Take a chance on me tonight
I'll be your girl, stick by your side
Don't gotta worry, everything's alright
Take a chance on me tonight
Take a chance on me tonight
I'll be your girl, stick by your side
Don't gotta worry, everything's alright
Take a chance on me
Baby, won't you take a chance?
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance
Oh, take a chance, take a chance, take a chance
Oh, take a chance, take a chance, take a chance
Take a chance, take a chance
