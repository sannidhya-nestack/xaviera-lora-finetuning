Guess I finally bottomed out
There's nowhere left to run
Kinda feels like staring down
A barrel of a loaded gun
No more second chances
My horizon's getting bleak
My bridges are in ashes and
My inner strength is weak
I believe in something but I don't know what it is
Never much on miracles
But never needed one like this
The only life I'll ever live
Has been more take than it's been give
And as the thread I'm hanging by
Unravels right before my eyes
I cry, I cry
I cry, I cry
Walking straight off of a cliff every single day
Just assume it's a mistake if it ever goes my way
Trapped inside this running joke that I call my life
Knowing what I have become, a cut's just like a knife
I believe in something but I don't know what it is
Never much on miracles
But never needed one like this
The only life I'll ever live
Has been more take than it's been give
And as the thread I'm hanging by
Unravels right before my eyes I cry
I believe in something but I don't know what it is
Never much on miracles
But I never needed one like this
The only life I have to live
Has been more take than it's been give
As this thread I'm hanging by
Unravels right before my eyes
I cry, I cry
I cry, I cry
