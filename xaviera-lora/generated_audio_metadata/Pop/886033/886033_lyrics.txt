I used to sing everything solo
Lost in my own melody
Then you came along
Like a beautiful song
And I wanted to learn the harmony
Cause you give me all the loving I need
Used to be I was so lonely
Love just kept passing me by
But my heart was changed
On the day you came
It was locked until you turned the key
Cause you give me all the loving I need
I used to think love was stupid
Just kinda lame
But since I got down with cupid
I've got some skin in the game
Got no clue what I'd do without you
How I would even get by
Babe when you are here
New days disappear
I feel so happy and free
Cause you give me all the loving I need
I used to think love was stupid
Just kinda lame
But since I got down with cupid
I've got some skin in the game
Thank God the day that He made you
And I thank God the day that we met
With you by my side
I cannot be denied
There's a new world you've opened up to me
you give me all the lovin'
All the kisses and huggin'
You give me all the lovin' I need
Give me all the loving I need
