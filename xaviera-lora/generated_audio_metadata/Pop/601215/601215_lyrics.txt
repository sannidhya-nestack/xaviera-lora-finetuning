Are these the words you've waited for?
Stumbling from my mouth
I never thought I'd hold this in so long
I'm breaking every rule I've made
I'm breaking down my day by day
I'm in too deep
I didn't mean to tear you down
I know it's pointless here by now
I'd cut you off and up someday you'd understand
I couldn't wait to feel alive
I thought I found us in your eyes
We were so close but lost we never had a plan
And I wrote the moon and poured it in for you
But it never really mattered
Like you it's cold as hell
I tried to warm you up in time
We were so reckless like your roommates on acoustic
We were never quite in tune
You were always too damn loud
I'm in too deep
I didn't mean to tear you down
I know it's pointless here by now
I'd cut you off if someday you'd understand
I couldn't wait to feel alive
I thought I found us in your eyes
We were so close but lost we never had a plan
Last time I
It's been so long, I can't recall it (It was the last time I'll come to my senses, the last time I'll come to my senses)
The last time, I'll come to my senses
The last time, I'll stray from these plans you were there
Last time, I came to my senses
The last time, I'll stray from these plans
All of the city was backed in the corner
Pushing themselves towards the top
So was I
So is I
'Cause I'm in too deep
I didn't mean to tear you down
I know it's pointless here by now
I'd cut you off and up some day you'd understand
I couldn't wait to feel alive
I thought I found us in your eyes
We were so close but lost we never had a plan
