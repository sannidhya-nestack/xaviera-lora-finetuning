Life is gonna be great
Can't you see I just radiate
Now I'm dusting off my wings
I'll go hovering high up there
now I've shaken off the weight
I don't need it, I'm free and clear
Without any fear
Here I go'cause my life's taking off
There's no ceiling, I broke down the walls
I'm on fire, I can't be rattled
I'm on top, I've won my battles
Here I go'cause my life's taking off
In myself I've got faith
Dreams are meant to be chased
Bright red carpets rolling out
Things unfolding so naturally
And now I'm revving up
For these days to come so excitedly
No limits on me
Here I go'cause my life's taken off
There's no ceiling, I broke down the walls
I'm on fire, I can't be rattled
I'm on top, I've won my battles
Here I go,'cause my life's taking off
Oh, how I've waited for this to come around
Been such a long time coming, I'm ready now
Here I go'cause my life's taking off
There's no ceiling, I broke down walls
Life is gonna be great
Can't you see I just radiate
Life is gonna be here I go'cause my life's taken note
Can't you see I just raised a C and I broke down walls
Life is gonna be great
Can't you see I just radiate
Life is gonna be great
