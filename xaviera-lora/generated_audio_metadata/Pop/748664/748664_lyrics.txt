Emily sings all the right words
Shifting and flailing that she don't hang around
Her boys on guitar always in her heart
There ain't no sound like that around
Not in this town, round
Your hometown, round
And now, I could be the only thing that remains in your heart, oh-oh-oh
Oh, ooh, Emily Ray, oh
Oh, ooh, Emily Ray
Down to the pier
Hand in hand with
Trailing the colour only the past
Could provide
Over the shore
Sunset is sure to fade the icon in her eyes
Make her feel fine'round your hometown
Round and round and round and round and round and round and round
I could be the only thing that remains in your heart
Oh, Emily Ray, oh
Why do you feel the need to conform?
You could still bloom
How come nobody told you'round your hometown?
Round and out
I could be the only thing that remains
In your heart, oh, oh, oh
Oh, Emily Ray
Oh, oh, Emily Ray
Oh, Emily Ray
