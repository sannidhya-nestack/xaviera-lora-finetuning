Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The summer settles in
We're driving around, windows are down
Singing loud like they're listening
And how could you not want to stay
When there's nothing but love all around
And the night's as clear as day
The way you hold me up
The way you calm me down
The beating of your heart
Blends in with the sound
Of the ocean speaking words
You may call me crazy
But I believe what I heard
This is what it's all about
So they say
And I'm finding out today
This is what it's all about
So they say
And I'm finding out
Today
The crisp air swings the sea (swings the sea)
It swings the salt, it swings the sweet (swings you)
It swings you into me
Why we stay like this?
It's hard to believe anything else exists
They dance around us now
We're in a different world but we'll get back somehow
I am here with you
As far as we're concerned this is what we're meant to do
This is what it's all about
So they say
And I'm finding out today
This is what it's all about, so they say
And I'm finding out today
This is what it's all about, so they say
And I'm finding out today
This is what it's all about, so they say
And I'm finding out today
