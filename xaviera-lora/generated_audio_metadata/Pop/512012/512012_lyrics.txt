I'm on the edge of a great grand canyon
With my arms wide open, I'm ready to fly
I'm gonna sail over that canyon
I am finally ready to say goodbye
Between the great wide open
And the great unknown
There's a bridge called faith in me
It's gonna carry me home
I turn to you to wish you well
But you're no longer standing by my side
You're walking backwards from my arms wide open
And I watch you wipe away a tear in your eye
Between the grey
Wide open and the great unknown
There's a bridge called faith in me
That's gonna carry me home
As I fly over that canyon
I have no regrets and I will no longer cry
Because the distance that I will travel
Is already there between you and I
Between the great wide open
And the great wide open
I know there's a bridge called faith in me
That'll carry me home, home
Carry me home
