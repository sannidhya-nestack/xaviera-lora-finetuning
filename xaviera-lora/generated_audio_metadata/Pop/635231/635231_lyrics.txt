You, you make me sing
About happy things and you make my heart ring
I feel just like a spoonful of joy
I twirl like a toy
Rushing with sunshine lifting my voice
You just make me want to sing
I am taken in
I feel warm and toasty, I just love it when
You got this way of bringing me up
Smoothing me out
Rounding my edges, trashing the rut
You just make me want to sing
I see you here beside me
It's better than before
You sail me straight to happy
With so much more in store
I can't contain this stirring urge of singing doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
You, you make me sing
Like daydream inspired blue
Fresh morning wind
Each whisper of you flows round my mind
Drifts out of time
Bounces through heaven cause you're so divine
You just make me want to sing
I see you here beside me
It's better than before
You sail me straight to happy
With so much more in store
I can't contain this stirring urge of singing doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo
Do do do do do do
Do do do
Do do
You make me wanna sing
Do do do
Do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do
Do do
Yes, you make me wanna sing
Do-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do
You make me wanna sing
