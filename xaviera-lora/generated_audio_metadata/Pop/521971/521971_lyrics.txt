It's a summer's day, summer in July
I had a swim today and I've been wondering why
When I felt satisfied, missing the signs
When I felt reassured, nothing to hide
You take in my summertime blue
I am here falling for you
On a summer's day somewhere near the pool
Ooh, your eyes are twinkling and the water's cool
In my head's adventure, those still in doubt
My heart's watering down, come in and find out
Take in my summertime blues
I am here falling for you
Take in my summertime blue
I am here falling for you
It's a summer's day, the late afternoon
I had a drink and it must all be over soon
Oh my heart is beating something to hide
I hate men competing but my hands are tied
You take in my summertime blue
And I am here falling for you
