When I think of you, my heart breaks
It's been so long since I have seen your face
I have never felt so alone
How am I supposed to carry on?
I just wanna be with you
I can't breathe without you
I can't believe you're gone
Everything is wrong
And I can't breathe without you
Hold me one more time in my dreams
I still hear your voice inside my head
I can see you smiling at me
I just need to have you here again
Cause I just wanna be
With you
I can't breathe without you
I can't believe you're gone
Everything is wrong
And I can't breathe without you
Nothing means anything anymore
I'd give everything to see you walk through that door
'Cause I just wanna be with you
I can't breathe without you
I can't believe you're gone
Everything is wrong
And I can't breathe without you
