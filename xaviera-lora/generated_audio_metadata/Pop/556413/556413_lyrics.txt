La da da, la da da, da da da, da da da da
I got dirty clothes on the floor
A Kit Kat clock hangs on my door
Sometimes my hair is red
Or stout in dreads
I like to wear sneakers with my Sunday best
You may tease me when I sing off key
And when I'm dancing to a hip hop beat
But that don't bother me
Cause that's just who I am
What you see is what you get
That's just who I am
I know I'm crazy, can't change but baby I'm nobody else but me, just who I am
I'm not a gourmet chef, I must confess
I like cheesy chips on my tuna fish
I got a new tattoo says I love me too
And it always makes me happy when I hear the blues
You roll your eyes when I make funny faces
And when I skip around in public places
But that don't bother me
that's just who I am
What you see is what you get
That's just who I am
I know I'm crazy, can't change me baby
I'm nobody else but me, just who I am
I don't try for perfection
I'm not afraid of your rejection
Your words won't get in my way
'Cause that's just who I am
What you see is what you get
That's just who I am
I know I'm crazy, can't change me baby
I'm nobody else but me
I'll be nobody else but just who I am
Who I am, who I am, who I am
La da da, da da da da, who I am
