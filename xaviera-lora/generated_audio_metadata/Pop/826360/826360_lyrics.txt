I see your face now every day
And it's funny how I don't know what to say
You're always living it up with some helpless Romeo
But something tells me they're not what you're looking for
'Cause I know (know) do you know
This is killing me
You don't (don't) need those boys around you anymore
I'm the one
I'm
I know you're wondering when I'll meet with you
And how impressed you're gonna be
And if you only knew the half of what I'd offer you
You might be sitting here with me
Somehow things don't turn the way you think they should
I know you feel something deep inside of you
I'm the one
'Cause I know (know) do you know this is killing me?
You don't (don't) need those boys around you anymore
Somehow things don't turn the way you think they should
I know you feel something deep inside of you
I'm the one, I'm the one
'Cause I'm the one, I'm the one
