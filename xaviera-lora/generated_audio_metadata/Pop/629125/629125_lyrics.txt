He will feed you with reasonable thoughts
He will cuddle with you as if you're meant to love
What if a dark cloud wouldn't get you lost?
What if you twist your foot in a hole?
But it feels like being softly hold
You will look through your fingers
Not to let the light shine
He will catch you if you accidentally fall
He will kindly reward you with a call
Ask yourself what a change would that be
The landscape was passing by
You banged your head, you screamed and cried
You felt finally high
The landscape was passing by
You banged your head, you screamed and cried
You felt finally high
The landscape was passing by, you banged your head, you screamed and cried, you felt finally high
Everything started with a fall
Everything started with a fall
