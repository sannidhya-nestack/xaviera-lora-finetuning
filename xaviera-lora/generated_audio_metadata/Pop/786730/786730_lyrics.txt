I can float like devastation
I can vanish in the weeds
Lead but brought constellations
For the endless undeceived
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
Roses in the graveyard, roses in the garden
Scattered in the black deleted scenes
I've been writing pages no one ever reads
Pop dreams, oh
I've been writing pop dreams, oh
Oh
I've been writing pop dreams, oh
I can't speak to the silence
Play a singular refrain
And I pull back the curtain
But the view remains the same
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Roses in the graveyard
Roses in the garden
Scattered in the black deleted scenes
I've been writing pages no one ever reads
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Pop dreams, oh
I've been writing pop dreams, oh
Oh, I've been writing palm trees
Oh, palm trees
Oh, I've been writing palm trees
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, I've been writing palm trees
Oh, oh, oh
