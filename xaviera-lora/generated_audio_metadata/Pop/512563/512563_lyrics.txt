Ooh, ooh, ooh
Nothing's going on tonight
Dark shadows cut through the light
There you are, sitting over there
In the smoke filled air
You always come here alone
Right about half past nine
Scotch on the rocks
And take your place reserved for you
You could be just a guy
But there's a side of you to see
Are you washing your hands?
Are you washing them clean?
What do you do? Where do you go when you are not here?
Sitting over there in the smoke filled air
Nothing's going on tonight
Your face is all I see through the night
You're standing there alone
Your intention
Is unknown, you could be just a guy
But there's a side of you to see
Are you washing your hands?
Are you washing them clean?
What do you do?
Where do you go when you are not here?
Sitting over there in the smoke field
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
