Remember when we laughed throughout the day
Crying together not alone
Now it seems that we are slowly drifting apart
Living separate lives inside one home
Where will you be when tomorrow comes?
Remember when we used to second guess our thoughts
Knowing what each other planned to say
Where did all the synergy and insight go?
Silence turning color into grey
Will we heal and make it through today?
Times change, love drifts
Are we now heading this way?
Is our love not strong enough to make it through?
Is there no more space left on this page?
Surely we should fight and give it one more try
Remembering that closeness we both crave
I believe our love can still be saved
Where will you be when tomorrow comes?
Please don't tell me that you've took the page
