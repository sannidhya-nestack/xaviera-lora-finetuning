Make up your mind'cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
Don't waste my time'cause I need to know
How you feel, what's your deal, do you know what you need?
What you need? You can talk, can you walk, can you take the lead?
if you're ready for love, I'll be waiting at the top
If you're ready for love, I'll meet you by the clock
Are you ready for love?
Love, love
Stop digging a hole, you've lost control
Lost control, just head my way, I can't wait all day
Make the choice, use your voice, say my name
Say my name, sing my song, you strum me long, mm-mm
if you're ready for love, I'll be waiting at the top
If you're ready for love, I'll meet you by the clock
if you're ready for love, I'll be waiting at the top
If you're ready for love, I'll meet you by the clock
Are you ready for love? (Are you ready for love?)
Love, love
Oh, I got your attention now
Are you proud to be my man?
Oh, I loved you for all my life
And I told you that we'd can
You were ready for love and I was waiting at the top
You were ready for love and I met you by the clock
You were ready for love and I was waiting at the top
You were ready for love, and I met you by the clock
Are you ready for love? (Are you ready for love?)
Love, love, mm-mm, mm-mm
Are you ready for love?
