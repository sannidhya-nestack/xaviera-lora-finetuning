Under the weight I fall
Under the weight
I've got no bearing
You come and take it all
And all these street lights shine
Through your window
I can see them flickering on tonight
And I'm holding you
Oh, you got me, don't you, little girl?
It fools through
Twist a little while we'll twirl in your room
With my heart in your pocket
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
And before
Love didn't come so easy
And before
I've never hit this high, now
You
Oh you got me don't you little girl
It holds true
Oh twist a little while we're twirling in your room
In my heart, idiot
et she owned the land
You, oh you got me, I'm surely your girl
It moves through
Oh, a twist coming while we're twirling in your room
Oh, you got me, don't you little girl
It moves through
In my heart, in your pocket
In my heart, in your pocket
