It's hard enough, love
Strapped in to the backseat, songs on repeat rise above
You mean everything, can't say anything just this one time
I'll let you be right'cause all I feel is wrong
When the morning comes around, I'll rewrite a favorite song
Let's cut it up and lose our sense
You make me feel like no one else
Lost myself to find you
Hold on for a minute, put all my heart in it and I always knew
I'd be picking up the pieces alone without you just this one time
I'll let you be right'cause all I feel is wrong
When the morning comes around I'll rewrite our favorite song
Let's turn it up and lose ourselves (turn it up and lose ourselves)
You make me feel like no one else
Hey something's gotta give but there's nothing left to say
I know that I should go but my heart is saying stay
Let's turn it up and lose ourselves (turn it up and lose ourselves)
You make me feel like no one else
Just this one time
Just this one time
I'll let you be right,'cause all I feel is wrong
When the morning comes around, I'll rewrite our favorite song
This hunnid up in the zone sound (this hunnid up in the zone sound)
You make me feel like no one else
Someone's gotta give up, there's nothing left to say
I know that I should go, but my heart is saying stay
This hunnid up
And lose ourselves (and lose ourselves)
You make me feel like no one else
Make me feel, make me feel
You make me feel like no one else
Make me feel
