Baby it's just you and me out on the dance floor
Feels like I'm flying I'm higher I want more
Baby it's just you and me and I wanna go now
So for one night you're all mine let's make it loud
Tell me you don't wanna see how it goes down
Baby pull me close and get my feet up off the ground
I don't need no drama I need you
Baby just you and me
I just need you for one night, just this one night
Can you be my fantasy?'Cause baby it ain't hard to see your eyes, to see your eyes
Baby you've been tempting me and all I need is one night, one night, one night
Baby, it's just you and me, this is the moment
See the fire in your eyes, this is real, no disguise
Just you and me when nobody's watching
So baby, come on, they're playing our song
So tell me you don't want
See how it goes down
Baby pull me close and get my feet up off the ground
I don't need no drama I need you
Baby just you and me
I just need you for one night
Just this one night
Can you be in my fantasy
Cause baby it ain't hard to see your eyes
To see your eyes
Baby you've been tempting me
And all I need is one night
One night
One night, woah
You and me and
You and me and
You and me and
I'm a dance floor, you and me and
You and me and
You and me and
Tell me you don't wanna
See how it goes down
Baby pull me close and get my feet up off the ground
I don't need no drama, I need you
Baby just you and me
I just need you for one night, just this one night
Can you be my fantasy?
Cause baby it ain't hard to see your eyes, to see your eyes
Baby you've been tempting me and all I need is one night, just this one night
Can you be my fantasy?'Cause baby it ain't hard to see your eyes, to see your eyes
Baby you've been tempting me and all I need is one night, one night, one night
