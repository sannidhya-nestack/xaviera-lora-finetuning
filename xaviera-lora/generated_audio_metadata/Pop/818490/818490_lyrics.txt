Storm on the horizon
Tension fills the air
Positively charged
Negatively fair
Do you feel neglected
Is it something that I've done
Blindly unexpected
Now I face a loaded gun
For all this time I've had no peace of mind
And I struggle for a reason why
Should I stay or go, rather pain rather woe
Do I even have the strength to try
Hey, I'm moving on
Every curse you utter seems to bear my name
Evidently my fault, hang my head in shame
Storm clouds on the horizon, lightning strikes again
Your heart's hard as diamond
Your love's like acid rain
And for all this time I've had no peace of mind
And I struggle for a reason why
Should I stay or go, ride the pain, hide the woe
Do I even have the strength to try
Hey, I'm moving on
It's time to move on
Gotta move on
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
Storm on the horizon
Tension fills the air
Positively charged
Negatively fed
For all this time I've had no peace of mind
And I struggle for a reason why
Should I stay or go?
Let the pain hide the woe
Do I even have the strength to try?
Moving on
Oh yeah
Time to move on
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
Hey, time to move on
Oh, time to move on
Time to move on
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
Oh, come on baby
Move it, baby
Will you move it, baby
I gotta move on, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah
