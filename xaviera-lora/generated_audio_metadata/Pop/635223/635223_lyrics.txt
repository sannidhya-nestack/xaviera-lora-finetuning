Drop your worries, pick up on this fine stream of love we're riding on
Don't believe those silly rumors, life is a chore
I'm telling you just five, four, three, two, count it down
With me we'll blast off and next you'll see
What's behind us shrink and disappear out of view
Come on and breeze, breeze down this highway
Speed up this ride now, no triumphs too strong
To drag us down we'll breeze, breeze down this highway
We got more inside us
And this life is a dawn
We got it, it's a breeze
Windows down, we're flying by
And this fresh air smells like paradise
And we got our destination right, we're all clear
Come on just sing with me now don't be shy
We got great tunes on and turned up high
And our hearts stocked full with all supplies we could need
Come on and breeze breeze down this highway
Speed up this ride now no trial's too strong
It's a breeze down this highway
We got more inside us and this life isn't done
We got it, it's a breeze
Right now in this moment
I feel something growing
Strong good vibes are flowing out all around
This here now and after
Let's keep up the laughter
Let's relive this chapter time and again
Breeze down this highway
Speed up this ride now
Don't try us too strong
To drag us down we'll
Breeze
Breeze down this highway
We got more inside us
And this life is a done
We got it it's a breeze
