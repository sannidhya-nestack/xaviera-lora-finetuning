Falling down
Standing by the shore I was alone for so long
No one to hold me until you came along
Walking past the crowds I thought
I'd always have to face this on my own
Until you brought me home
Now I've fallen down
Falling, can't you see I'm here?
Won't you pick me up again?
Falling down, I'm falling, can't you see I'm here?
Won't you pick me up again?
Walking past the crowds I thought I'd always have to face this on my own
Until he brought me home
Now I'm falling down
Falling, can't you see I'm here?
Won't you pick me up again?
Falling down, I'm falling
Can't you see I'm here?
Won't you pick me up again?
