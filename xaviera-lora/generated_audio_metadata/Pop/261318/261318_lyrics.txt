Streets are empty, no one is home
They're in the Hamptons and I'm all alone
I can't afford a fancy holiday
But the city is mine, everyone else is away
Traffic flows, there are places to park
There are no vendors selling their art
And I am in the spotlight
Walking along Broadway
The city is mine
Everyone else is away
Up, down, my feet all are rooted underground
East, west, my hemisphere's a rest beneath the sun and moon
While I sing my song
Ooh la la, ooh la la, oh
Ooh la la, ooh la la, oh
The mayor's tired, he left me the key
So come on baby, come along with me
You can be a star, I'll make you king for a day
the city is mine, everyone else is away
The city is mine, everyone else is away
