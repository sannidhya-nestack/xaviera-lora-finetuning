I heard a rumor yesterday
Couldn't take the headline news
Not the time to walk away
Got lost inside this mood
Fragile heart don't miss a beat
Reaching for the strength inside
Come along and work with me
Open your doubting eyes, won't you?
Hold on, hold on, keep thinking about our love
Hold on, hold on and breathe, oh won't you?
Hold on, hold on, keep thinking about our love
Hold on to what you believe
Underneath the raging moon
If you let the pain subside
It's easy how to find the truth
Deep down we know what's right
Searching for your destiny
It's time to lend a helping hand
For the place is here with me
I'm sure you understand
You can hold on, hold on
Keep thinking about our love
Hold on, hold on and breathe
You can hold on, hold on
Keep thinking about our love
Hold on to what you believe
Sooner or later fear comes to town
Sooner or later I'm watching you drown
Sooner or later walls come tumbling down and we fall apart
Sooner or later
Sooner or later you will find
The crack in the mirror is out of sight
Sooner or later everything is sure to turn out right, yeah
And when you open up your eyes you will
Hold on, hold on
Keep thinking about our love
Hold on, hold on
Breathe
You will hold on, hold on, keep thinking about our love
Hold on to what you believe, won't you hold on, hold on
Keep thinking about our love
Hold on, hold on and breathe
Oh won't you hold on, hold on
Keep thinking about our love
Hold on to what you believe
Hold on to what you believe
Just hold on to what you
