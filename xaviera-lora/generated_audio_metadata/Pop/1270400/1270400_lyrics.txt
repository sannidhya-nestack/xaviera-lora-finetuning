Straight light shining bright
See comes alive tonight
Whispers in the cool air
Every moment feels so rare
Sneaking through the dark
Hearts racing like a spark
Mystery around us swirling
Feels like the world is twirling
Need you after hours babe
Where dreams never fade
In the shadows we unite
Lost in electric light
Time stands still with you
No secrets, just the truth
Every step, a heartbeat
Midnight love feels so sweet
In this night so deep
Promises we keep
Hold me close, don't let go
Under stars our love will grow
Meet you after hours, babe
Where dreams never fade
In the shadows we unite
Lost in electric light
Meet you after hours babe where dreams never fade
In the shadows we unite lost in electric light
Time stands still with you
No secrets just truth
Every step a heartbeat
Midnight love feels so sweet
