You've got style, you've got class
Last but not least, you've got fashion sense
I've got dreams of our marquee
We could make the perfect picture, you and me
What do you say?
Turn your pretty face my way, it will be just like
In the movies (just like the movies)
It will be just like a fairy tale come true
Time won't mean a thing when we're together baby (just like the movies)
As I love every minute spent with you
The night is young, the moon is bright
The scene is set for us to really do it upright
And your eyes, ooh, light up this town
There's no wonder that I keep on comin'round
Throw me a cue, drop me a line, baby, and things will be fine
It will be just like in the movies (just like in the movies)
It will be just like a fairy tale come true
And time won't mean a thing when we're together baby
I love every minute spent with you
Just like in the movies
It will be just like a fairy tale come true
Oh, and time won't mean a thing when we're together, baby
I love every minute spent with you
And da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
Da da
Da da da da da da
Da da
Da da da da da da

Get ready
Da da da da da da
Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah
