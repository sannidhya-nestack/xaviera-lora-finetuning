You make me rush and then you late
You say you'll call and then I wait
Behind your kiss I feel a joke
By night you're rich by day you're broke
I can't keep thinking that I made a mistake
I can't keep guessing is it real or is it fake
I can't spend one minute more if I gotta take
Nine miles of bullshit everywhere I go with you
Nine miles of bullshit time to take a shovel too
Nine miles of bullshit I can't keep on walking through
Nine miles of bullshit every night I'm listening to
Nine miles of bullshit
You used to be my favorite toy
Now when you smile I get annoyed
I've given in, I've given up
Seen where you've been and called your bluff
Now I know what's in that look on your face
I can't keep covering for you all over the place
I can't stand one minute more if I gotta take
Nine miles of bullshit everywhere I go with you
Nine miles of bullshit time to take a shovel too
Nine miles of bullshit I can't keep on walking through
Nine miles of bullshit every night I'm listening to
Nine miles of bullshit
It's your suitcase, put it in the car
Take your sad face, you know what you are
Save your crap for your buddies at the bar
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, done, done with
Nine miles of bullshit
Everywhere I go with you
Nine miles of bullshit
Time to take a shovel too
Nine miles of bullshit
I can't keep on walking through
Nine miles of bullshit
Every night I'm listening to
Nine miles of bullshit
Nine miles of bullshit
