The moon lights up your face I hold my breath, feel an urgency inside
To wake you up and tell you
All the things left unsaid for too long
The words hang heavy in my mouth
Like rain can't fall without a cloud
I don't have the strength to pour them out
I wanna tell you
You're the one I talk to in my dreams
I wanna tell you
These magic words I'm wanting you to hear
Then I hear you talking in your sleep
And I wonder, is it me you were talking to?
So I turn around to take a look
But your eyes are closed while your lips are moving
You say the words left in my mouth
Like rain they fall and break the droughts
Somehow you have the strength to pour them out
Toodling round my barricades
Breaking through the walls I'd made
Washing all my silly fears away
I wanna tell you
You're the one I talk to in my dreams
I wanna tell you
These magic words I'm wanting you to hear
These magic words I'm wanting you to hear
You double my pleasure in life and you
Halve my troubles
And I can't wait for every day that we
Start with cuddles
You're the one I talk to in my dreams
I wanna tell you
These magic words I'm wanting you to hear
I wanna tell you
You're the one I talk to in my dreams
I wanna tell you
These magic words I'm wanting you to
