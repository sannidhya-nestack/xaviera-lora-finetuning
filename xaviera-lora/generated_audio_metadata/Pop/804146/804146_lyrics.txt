I feel myself forever young
I feel my dreams take off the ground
I feel my dreams take off the ground
I feel myself forever young
Tonight I wanna close my eyes
Tonight my dreams like stars arise
And all my dreams like stars arise
I just don't wanna close my eyes
I just don't wanna close my eyes
I just don't wanna close my eyes
I just don't wanna close my eyes
I feel myself forever young
I feel my dreams take up the ground
I feel my dreams take up the ground
I feel myself
Forever young
Tonight I wanna close my eyes
Tonight my dreams like stars arise
And all my dreams like stars arise
I just don't wanna close my eyes
I just don't wanna close my eyes
I just don't wanna close my eyes
I just don't wanna close my eyes
