I was walking down a lonely street
Not looking ahead of me
As I passed the corner, saw you standing there
You were a million miles away
Your mind swimming with the stars that day
I won't fall apart for you
No it's the one thing I just wouldn't do
I won't fall apart for you
Each day I get stronger
Do you, do you miss me too?
I remember, oh I remember baby
The fire in your eyes
The way yourself is through me
No words can express the way I feel inside
I moved on but your heart still calls to me
I won't fall apart for you
No, it's the one thing I just wouldn't do
I won't fall apart for you
Each day I'll get stronger, do you?
Do you miss me too?
I won't fall apart for you
No, no, it's the one thing I just wouldn't do
I won't fall apart for you
Each day I get stronger
Do you, do you miss me too?
Do you miss me baby,'cause I miss you
Do you miss me?
