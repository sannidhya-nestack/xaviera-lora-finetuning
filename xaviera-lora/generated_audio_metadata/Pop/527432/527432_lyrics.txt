You looked at me like a natural born James Dean
Running your fingers through my hair, our lips came near
It was the harvest moon that would start our lovers year
Tangled in trust we shared our bed, our souls were sealed
Bye bye bitterness
Making my walls fall down
Crazy promises
Turning my world around
But you had to go
You had to leave me high and dry
How could I have known?
Then our hearts were not aligned
You just walked out on me like a cold winter breeze
You froze the love that left me blind
Now I'm wandering alone
Piecing the puzzle of your mind
I love the devil with angelic eyes
I don't need to know you've now found your mate
Don't wanna rain on your parade as your tear lights fade
I don't care you've found the love you've lost for years
I'm done with wasting tears, done but not yet here
No more bitterness
Making my walls fall down
Crazy promises
Turning my world around
you had to go
You had to leave me high and dry
How could I have known?
That our hearts were not aligned
You just walked out on me like a cold winter breeze
You froze the love that left me blind
Now I'm wandering alone
Piecing the puzzle of your mind
I love the devil with angelic eyes
And I've cried so many nights
Feeling numb throughout the days
Wondering how wrong could feel so right
How you laughed like a thief in the night
Don't mind anymore
I'm blessed with you gone
Although you left me high and dry
I couldn't have known
That our hearts were not aligned
You just walked out on me like a cold winter breeze
Freezing the love that made me blind
Now I'm wondering no more
Solving the puzzle of your mind
I love the devil with angelic eyes
