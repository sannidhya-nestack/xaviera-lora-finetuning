Better luck next time, that's what they always say
If you ever find love, do your best to throw it away
Well I guess you can't complain
And I've been on the losing side
Made me wanna run and hide away
But let me say it's a lovely thing
If the love you bring can stay with me
As not a single day goes by when you're not on my mind
I wonder do you think of me even from time to time
But I know it's been a while
And I've been on the losing side
Made me wanna run and hide away
But let me say it's a lovely thing
If the love you bring can stay with me
Yeah, with me
