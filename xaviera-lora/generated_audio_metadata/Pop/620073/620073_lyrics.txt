You said, you loved me, but I wasn't good enough
You said, you'd hold me, but I just knew you'd run
So many days without you, so many tears I shed
I'm stuck with a thought about you, remembering what you said
I try to find a reason to move on with my life
They tell me keep believing but nothing seems so right
I can't believe a word you say
Cause you ran and played your stupid games
And now I face this world without you (without you, without you, without you)
Remembering everything about you (about you, about you, about you, about you, about you)
Woah, woah, woah
And you said you loved me but I wasn't good enough
And you said you'd hold me but I just knew you'd run
So many days without you
So many tears I shed
I'm stuck with a thought about you
Remembering what you said
I try to find the meaning of the things you said that night
My heart keeps on bleeding for such a pointless fight
This is not how it's meant to be
you are the only one for me
And now I face this world without you (without you)
Remembering everything about you (about you)
Woah woah woah
You said you loved me but I wasn't good enough
You said you'd hold me but I just knew you'd run
So many days without you
So many tears I shed
I'm stuck with a thought about you
Remembering what you said
You said you would be there when I called
You said you'd never go
You said you would be there through it all
You said you'd never go
You said you loved me but I wasn't good enough
You said you'd hold me but I just knew you'd run
So many days without you in them
So many tears I shed
I'm stuck with a thought about you
Remembering what you said
You said you loved me but I wasn't good enough
You said you'd hold me but I just knew you'd run
So many days without you (you know)
So many tears I shed (I shed)
I'm stuck with a thought about you (about you)
Remembering what you said
