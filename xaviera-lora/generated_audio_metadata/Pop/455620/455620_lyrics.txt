I got brain free slow motion
Can't get you out of my mind
I wanna tell you but the words are so hard to find
Got a little secret I cannot keep
I love you even in my sleep and dream about you
Am I dreaming the impossible dream when I dream about you
there's no way a dream like you could ever come true
Now it's a variation on an old theme
I love you
You don't even see me
I'm a birthday balloon ready to burst on your scene
Just pop me'cause all I ever get to do is dream about you
Beautiful dreamer, I see you in me when I dream about you
When I close my eyes, I dream about how sweet it could be
I claim it, believe in it all
When you dream of love
I'm in the middle of it all
I stretch the story, twist and spin it
If only for another minute
I can dream about you
Hurry Mr. Sandman, bring me my dream
I dream about you
Fiction's not always as strange as it seems
So I dream about you
I'm a dreamer
Dreaming about you
sometimes dreams come true
