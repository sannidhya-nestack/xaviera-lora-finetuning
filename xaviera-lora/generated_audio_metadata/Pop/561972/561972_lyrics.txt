Finds comfort in another glass of wine
Closes her eyes and dreams away
With cloud in mind she spends some time
It's all the same as yesterday
Over now, well it's over now
Differences separate our ways
Over now, it's all over now
Differences seems far away today
Sleeps tight and day while he's away
She dreams she's fallen once again
Regrets the words she had to say
Can't figure out what's wrong with men
Over now, well it's over now
Differences separate on waves
For now, it's all over now
Differences seems far away today
Why else would we end it
Why else would we end it
It's over now, well it's over now
Differences separate our ways
Over now, it's all over now
Differences seems far away today
Why else would we end it?
Why else would we end it?
