And it's true, it's you
We are feeling blue
What can we do?
And it's true, it's you
We're feeling blue
What can we do?
Feel my love yesterday
Feel my love always
Always
A shining star to lift my heart
Feel yesterday
Feel my love
Always
Always
And it's true, it's you
We are feeling blue
What can we do?
And it's true, it's you
We're feeling blue
What can we do?
Feel my love, yesterday
Feel my love, always
Always, a shining star to lift my heart
Feel yesterday, feel my love always
And it's true, it's you, we are feeling blue
What can we do? And it's true, it's you, we're feeling blue
What can we do? Feel my love, yesterday
Feel my love always
Always, always
