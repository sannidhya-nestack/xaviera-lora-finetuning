Girl, I just need to be with you
And, it don't matter the price
Feels like, no mountain I could climb
Could bring me closer to you, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't know how I should approach but if
When I do
It won't matter what you say
I'll come back
I'll keep coming back and I
I don't know
There's just something'bout you
I can smile all night and day
Say my name
You'll remember all the same
All the same
I'm in heaven and I
Feel like
I touched the sky
How I feel, how I feel
When I'm with you and you
Can't buy
This kind of smile
On my face, on my face
When I'm with you and I
They always talk about love games (talk about love games)
But I can never play loving any game to me
Seems like no ocean I could cross
Would leave you falling in love with me
Oh oh oh oh oh
I don't know how I should approach but if
When I do
It won't matter what you say
I'll come back
I'll keep coming back and I
I don't know
There's just something'bout you
I could smile all night and day
Say my name
You'll remember all the same
All the same
I'm in heaven and I
Oh
Oh, you don't, don't know how
How I feel, this is real
If I could steal your heart
Then you would know where we could go
Say yes or no, oh
It won't matter what you say
I'll come back, I'll keep coming back and I
I don't know, there's just something'bout you
I could smile all night and day
Say my name, you'll remember
All the same, all the same
I'm in heaven and I
It won't matter what you say
I'll come back, I'll keep coming back and I
I don't know, there's just something'bout you
I could smile all night and day
Say my name, you'll remember
All the same, all the same
I'm in heaven and I
I touch the sky (How I feel, how I feel when I'm with you, when I'm)
Can't buy this kind of smile (On my face, on my face when I'm with you and I)
