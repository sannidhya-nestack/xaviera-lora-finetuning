Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Morning light so sweet
Dancing in the street
Every heartbeat new
Chasing skies of blue
Lefty feels the air
No room for despair
She's a gonna chase
Find a happy place
Oh, this place of life
In the day and night
Every moment bright
All the spikes of life
Colours fill the sky
Life it passes by
Home in dance we go
Let the feelings flow
Take the highs the lows
That's the way it goes
In this dance we fight
Magic in her twice
All the spice of life
In the day and night
Every moment bright
All the spice of life
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Laughter fills the air
Known for despair
Dreams we're gonna chase
Find a happy place
All the spice of life
All the spice of life
In the day and night
Every moment bright
All the spice of life
Ooh ooh ooh
