MJ and Wild Bill try to Netflix and chill
Wind up only zooming
She's a bad kitty, OMG, lookin' all Gucci
Hopin' love's bloomin' (Really?)
But postin' selfies makes her look thirsty
Triggers Bill to spill the tea
And Bill tells MJ, "In no uncertain terms"
Slay me with your eyes
You and I should be partners in crime
No more love online, head for bedside
How about L-M-I-R-L tonight?
Slay me with your eyes
And then MJ tells Bill
Virtual romance doesn't have any chance
It just disturbs the flow
You're on fleek, off beat, statutory hood
Wink your motto is YOLO (YOLO)
You're lit, crossfit, glad you got my digits
We skirt now, hey we're gonna miss it
And MJ tells Bill
Slay me with your eyes
You and I should be partners in crime
No more love online, head for bedside
How'bout L-M-I-R-L tonight
Slay me with your eyes
Now what do we know about Bill?
I mean is he even real?
Now I don't care if you wanna roast me
Just don't dare ever try to ghost me
And MJ and Bill both agree
Lay me with your eyes
You and I should be partners in crime
No more love online, head for bedside
How'bout L-M-I-R-L tonight?
Slay me with your eyes
You and I should be partners in crime
This must be what open heart surgery's like
Not a drop of painkiller in sight (what?)
Slay me with your eyes
Slay me with your eyes
Slay me with your eyes (you're kidding me)
Slay me with your eyes
