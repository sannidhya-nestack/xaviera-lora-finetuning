When the world acts crazy it's when I need you the most
When everything gets so busy and I can barely move my toes
I know it's time to unwind leave my walls and worries outside
Plug it in turn it on
Turn it up sing along
When the subway gets crowded
And I'm on my way home
It's like my body's surrounded
It's a cue to find my form
it's time to unwind
Leave the noise and the talking outside
Plug it in, turn it on
Turn it up, sing along
I close my eyes
I'm feeling good
My favorite song plays
And again I'm hooked
I didn't know I could feel that way
When you kissed me the other day
Suddenly it was a fairy tale
Oh oh, oh oh
Made a wish to a shooting star
Now look at us, look at where we are
Living life like a fairy tale
Oh oh, oh oh
Plug it in, turn it on
Plug it in, turn it on, oh oh
When my mind's unhappy
For reasons I don't know
I really need something catchy
To get my back into my soul
I know it's time to unwind
Be alone, leave the bad things outside
Plug it in, turn it on
Turn it up, sing along
I close my eyes
I'm feeling good
My favorite song plays and again I'm hooked
I didn't know I could feel that way
When you kissed me the other day
Suddenly it was a fairy tale, oh oh, oh oh
Made a wish to a shooting star
Now look at us, look at where we are
Living life like a fairy tale, oh oh
Plug it in, turn it on
Plug it in, turn it on, oh
Plug it in, turn it on
Plug it in, turn it on, oh-oh-oh-oh
When a day turns bad
When I'm feeling sad
When I saw too much
The worst I've had
I close my eyes
I'm feeling good
My favourite song plays
And again I'm cured
Yeah
I didn't know I could feel that way
When you kissed me the other day
Suddenly it was a fairy tale
Oh oh, oh oh
Made a wish to a shooting star
Now look at us, look at where we are
Living life like a fairy tale
Oh oh, oh oh
Plug it in, turn it on, plug it in, turn it on
Plug it in, turn it on, plug it in, turn it on
Made a wish to a shooting star
Now look at us, look at where we are
Living life like a fairy tale
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Plug it in, turn it on
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Plug it in, turn it on
Plug it in, turn it on
Plug it in, turn it on
Oh-oh
Plug it in, turn it on
Plug it in, turn it on
Plug it in, turn it on
Oh-oh
Plug it in, turn it on
Plug it in, turn it on
