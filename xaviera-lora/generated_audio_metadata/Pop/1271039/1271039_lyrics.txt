In the quiet of the night
When the stars are all aglow
I see the silence of your eyes
Telling stories I don't know
Every glance a whispered word
My spoken love you try to hide
In the silence of your eyes
Secrets locked up deep inside
Oh the silence of your eyes
Speaks a million dreams and more
In the silence of your eyes
I find the love I'm looking for
Through the shadows and the light
Every moment passing by
In the silence of your eyes
I can see the reason why
No need for words to break the spell
In your eyes I see it all
The silence tells a tale so well
In your gaze I fall and fall
Oh the silence of your eyes
Speaks a million dreams and more
In the silence of your eyes
I find the love I'm looking for
Oh, the silence of your eyes
Speaks a million dreams and more
In the silence of your eyes
I find the love I'm looking for
Through the shadows and the light
