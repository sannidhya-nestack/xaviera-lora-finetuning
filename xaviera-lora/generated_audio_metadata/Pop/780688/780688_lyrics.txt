When all the odds are stacked against me
I try a little harder
When every hill appears steeper than a mountain
I won't give up
When all my prayers appear on the other side
I'll keep on praying (I'll keep on praying)
When every day seems harder than the last
I'll be there to face another challenge
I won't let nothing stand in my way
I may need a helping hand, it won't be wasted
It keeps me feeling strong
It keeps me striving on
I won't give up, won't give up
Until my job, my job is done
I won't give up (won't give up)
Until my fight is won
When all my words appear unspoken
And no one can hear my voice (hear my voice)
I'll find the courage that's precious out there
To keep me close (ah)
When I knock on every door and there's no answer
A voice inside my head says try one more
When every avenue is leading nowhere
I keep on being strong
I keep on striving on
And now I won't give up (won't give up)
Until my job, my job is done
I won't give up (won't give up),
Surviving like an English rose
Through the winter storm it grows
Reach into the sky to live a new day
I won't give up
I won't give up, I'll be like an English rose, yeah
Through the winter storm it blows (I won't give up)
Reach into the sky (won't give up)
I won't give up, yeah (I won't give up)
I won't give up, yeah (I won' give up)
I won't give up, won't give up (no, no, no, no)
I won't give up, no, no, no
