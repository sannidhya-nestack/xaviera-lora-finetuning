Everything to everyone, bending over backwards
He'll try to be what you want in a million places
One push and he'll spring right back while pulling you faces
Elastic man with elastic plans and lesson learned
Soul returned, unopened
Stretchy mouth for the stretched truth
Spine removed, unbroken
He'll try to be who you want, do the best that he's able
Be the head of the restaurant or a crumb at your table
Elastic man with elastic fins will come and go
Ebb and flow, forsaken
Bouncy groove made for bouncy moods
Vision skewed and shaken
Everything to everyone
Ending over backwards
Pin him down, it can't be done
His mind's made up, it's undone too
He's stretched so thin, he's quite see-through
And all the lies are coming true
Yeah, no, no, yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Stick your sweet bitter pill
Know you won't, yes you will
Hype it up, kill the buzz
Says it can never do us
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Plastic men with elastic hands for bigger blows
Slamming doors once open
Bendy pen for the bendy rules
Bendy fools have spoken
Everything to everyone but you
