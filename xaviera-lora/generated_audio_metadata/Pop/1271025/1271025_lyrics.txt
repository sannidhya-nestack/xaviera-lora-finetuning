Colors paint my mind
Shades I never find, oh
Let's go tonight
Hearts so vibrant light, oh
I hear a sparking glow
A river starts to flow, oh
Capturing the hues in everything I do, I do
Shades of creativity living in my soul
Making something out of nothing it's the way I roll
Feeling every heartbeat my stories unfold
Brush strokes on the page, breaking from the cage
Letting go of fears, music in my ears
Patterns come alive in every twist and dive
Creating worlds anew in red and green and blue
Shades of creativity living in my soul
Making something out of nothing, it's the way I roll
Feeling every heartbeat that stories unfold (stories unfold, stories unfold)
Brush strokes on the page
Breaking from the cage
Letting go of fears
In my ears
Patterns come alive
In every twisted dive
Creating worlds anew
In red and green and blue
Shades of creativity
Living in my soul
Making something out of nothing
It's the way I roll
Feeling every heartbeat that
Stories unfold
