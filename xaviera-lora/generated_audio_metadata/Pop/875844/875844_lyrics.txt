I wanna be
By your side, I wanna be
On the night, singing blue songs
Singing blue songs
Catch a wave or two
Write a line of you
Paint a colour of you
To reflect my heart so true
I wanna be
By your side
I wanna be
On the night of
Singing blue songs
Singing blue songs
Singing those songs, singing those songs
I wanna be
By your side
I wanna be
Older than I am
Singing blue songs
Singing blue songs
Catch a wave or two
Write a line of you
Paint a picture of you
To reflect my heart so true
I wanna be
By your side
I wanna be
On the night of
Singing those songs
Singing those songs
