I need you in a peer
You looking so confused
Whoever told you this was something you might lose
I see you sitting there
You've simply lost your way
You know the sun is gonna shine again on you someday
And it's a long way back to where you come from
Gonna see yourself shining in the sun and
Take a look ahead to where you're going everything will be just fine
You know I love you
You know you love you too
Let's change this color scheme from screaming red to bright blue
it's a long way back to where you come from
Gonna see yourself shining in the sun and
Time to look ahead to where you're going everything will be just fine
Feeling jaded, complicated
Trying so hard to write album
'Cause it's a long way back to where you come from
Gonna see yourself shining in the sun and
Time to look ahead to where you're going everything will be just fine
And it's a long
Back to where you come from
Gonna see yourself shining in the sun and
Time to look ahead to where you're going
Everything will be just fine
And it's love
Way back to where you come from
Gonna see yourself shining in the sun again
Time will come back to where you go and everything will be just fine
You gotta free your heart and shine
