Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Every day's a struggle
When you're on the down slide
Getting into trouble
Is the way of life
All the time you're fighting
And you want to escape
Just about surviving
Need to find your way
Light and darkness
You're somewhere in between
Getting restless
Something to believe
You're falling and calling
You're hanging in midair
Try to stay strong
Keep flying on a wing and a prayer
You're waiting and taking small steps not getting there
Now your time has come keep flying on a wing and a prayer
Every day's a battle
When you take a wrong turn
Running up that steep hill
Seems you never learn
Still believing
Things will work out right
Strongest feeling
Looking down the line
You're falling and calling
Still hanging
Try to stay strong, keep flying on
Owing and a prayer
You're waiting and taking
Small steps not getting there
Now your time has come, keep flying on
Your time has come, keep flying on, a wing and a prayer
Your time has come, keep flying on, a wing and a prayer
A wing and a prayer
