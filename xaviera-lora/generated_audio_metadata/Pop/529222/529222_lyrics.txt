Why does it feel like déjà vu?
Yet why does it hurt like never before?
You seem to be a stranger now
Yet I've known you so many lives before
Why does it seem so old and timeless
When I met you only yesterday
Why does the move look so new
When I've danced a hundred times before
The play button's on, but the images rewind, oh yeah
The play button's on, but the pictures unwind, I still like the
Why does it feel like the same rain
Yet it smells so fresh today
A new sun sets every evening
Yet the horizon has not changed
When I look in the mirror I see
And not just my face but so many ghosts
Behind my shoulder stands a lion
Filled with reality and my mind
The play button's on, but the images rewind, oh yeah
The play button's on, but the pictures unwind, but still last time
There might be pauses, but I shall be forever holding your hand, my love
There might be pauses, but I shall be forever holding your hand, my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, oh, mm
