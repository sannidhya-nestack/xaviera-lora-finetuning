Down
Keep an open mind, I don't think so
Break apart my soul, not just yet
Listen to what's on I don't think so
I like my stubborn where it's at
Music of today is like a cloud that covers the earth (and it's not just in my mind)
Same grey white black dream
Every single time
Oh time
My time
Your bed
Get even
Get ready
Get mad, get even, get ready
Styles and words like snowflakes that hit the ground
Gone in an instant, hello so long, I'm out
But I found a new friend in this city
Won't you step outside yourself
And give this thing a try
We could do without
This place we dreamed about
Everybody's mad on Madison
Beautiful at dawn (beautiful at dawn)
That street goes on and on
Let's stay here for another day
We've got to admit it
We don't work without it
New York is perfect, perfect, perfect now and then
Perfect, perfect, perfect now and then
