It was never easy for me
I was too complicated, over-speculated
Why couldn't I let things go?
It was never a breeze for you
You were too regulated, over calculated
Why didn't you let things go
One step closer to the moment
For I broke your heart
And you tore everything apart
Move me nearer
Stop the motion
What we had is gone
And everything we know is wrong
I'm tired of always working
Do not be confused or somewhat used
Why did I have to let things go?
You're always rearranging
Making sure that you're not used or slightly amused
Why did you let things go one step closer to the moment
For I broke your heart
And tore everything apart
Move me nearer
Stop the motion
What we had is gone
And everything we know is wrong
I tried to love you, you broke my heart
How did this happen, when did it start?
How do you love me? (How do you love me?)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
