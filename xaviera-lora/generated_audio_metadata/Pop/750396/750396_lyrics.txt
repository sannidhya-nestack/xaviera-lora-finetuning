I thought I could breathe underwater with you
Now our love is drowning, I'm broken in two
I don't wanna wait another life
Baby this is fate, you and I
I just wanna take another dive
One last time
Take me back to where it started and lay me down
Be my harness, the night will last for a lifetime
And our stars will guide us back home
Guide us back home
Guide us back home
Thought I could walk through the fire for you
And my heart is burning, I can't see this through
I don't wanna wait another life
Baby this is fate, you and I
I just wanna take another dive
One last time
Take me back to where it started and lay me down
Be my harness
The night will last for a lifetime
And our stars will guide us back home
Guide us back home
Guide us back home
Take my hand and don't let go
Guide us, guide us, guide us home
Take my hand and don't let go
Guide us, guide us, guide us home
Take me back to where it started and lay me down
Be my harness, the night will last
For a lifetime in our stars
To guide us back home
Guide us back home
Guide us back home
