You can count the times your dreams have been broken
Maybe a dozen
And you can count some sheep if that helped you sleep
But if it doesn't
Then you can count all the stars that shine in the sky
And all the clouds as they drift by
But I hope you know when push comes to shove
The only thing that really counts is love
You can count on me to give you a smile if you don't have one
Yeah you know I'll go that one extra mile to show you some fun
And you can count all the stars that shine in the sky
And all the clouds as they drift by
But I hope you know when push comes to shove
The only thing that really counts is love
Enjoy yourself, that's common sense
May happiness always find you
But I've learned from experience
The things of this world can bind you
In a thousand years when we are all gone
All this is history
Of people still will write their stories and songs
How life's a mystery
And they may count all the stars that shine in the sky
And all the clouds as they drift by
But I hope they know when push comes to shove
The only thing that really counts is love (love's the only thing that counts)
The only thing that really counts is love
