I like us hanging out, we're having tons of fun
Something good is going down, and we've barely just begun
I can't wait
It's getting better by the moment
Feels so great
We've got it all and we both know it
Holding hands, don't need plans
We're riding high, we're on a roll
Trust in fate, let's celebrate
Oh oh oh, I can't wait
We could lounge around at home
Or party under neon lights
You can fly me to the moon
Every day and every night
I can't wait
It's getting better by the moment
Feels so great
We've got it all and we both know it
Holding hands don't need plans
We're riding high we're on a roll
Trust in fate let's celebrate
Oh oh oh I can't
Even when I'm sleeping, I keep on made believing
Dreaming'bout being close to you
I can't wait, it's getting better by the moment
Feels so great
We've got it all and we both know it
Holding hands don't need plans
We're riding high, we're on a roll
Trusting fate, let's celebrate
Oh oh oh I can't wait
