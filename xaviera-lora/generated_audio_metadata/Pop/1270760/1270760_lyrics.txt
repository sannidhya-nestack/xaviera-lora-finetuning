Smiley face can show my heart
Thumbs up doesn't play the part
Thinking I'm used to far
Beyond emojis here we start
Crying face won't help me now
Broken heart and shining vow
The world fell but I can't bow
Words mean more but I don't know how
Beyond emojis I can't feel
Speak the truth let's keep it real
Know how well we'll seal the deal
Immortals can't help me heal
Hot eyes but my soul is blue
One hundred sun and still missing you
Fire flames but there's no view
Stock of love and all we do
Beyond emojis I can't feel
Speak the truth let's keep it real
No L .O .L. will seal the deal
Emoticons can't help me heal
Ghost in love and bits of lie
Find the way back to my heart
Hugging faces drift apart
Digital love ain't so smart
Beyond emojis I can't feel
Speak the truth let's keep it real
No LOL will seal the deal
Emoticons can't help me heal
Beyond emojis I can't feel
Speak the truth let's keep it real
No, I'm a well-sealed deal
Game on, it comes, can't help me here
Ghost in love and thinks alive
Find a way back to my heart
Hugging faces to goodbye
Pigeon love ain't so smart
