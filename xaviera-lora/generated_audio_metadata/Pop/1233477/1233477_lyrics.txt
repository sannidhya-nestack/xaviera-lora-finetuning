MJ and Wild Bill
Try to Netflix and chill
Wind up only zooming
She's a bad kitty, OMG
Looking all Gucci
Hoping love's blooming
Slay me with your eyes
You and I should be partners in crime
No more love online, head for bedside
How'bout L-M-I-R-L tonight
Slay me with your eyes
And then MJ tells Bill
Virtual romance doesn't have any chance
It just disturbs the flow
You're on fleek, off beat, statutory hood
Wink your motto is YOLO, YOLO
You're lit, crossfit, glad you got my digits
If we skirt now, hey, we're gonna miss it
And MJ tells Bill
Slay me with your eyes
You and I should be partners in crime
No more love online, head for bedside
How'bout L-M-I-R-L tonight?
Slay me with your eyes
Now what do we know about Bill?
I mean, is he even real?
Now I don't care if you wanna roast me
Just don't dare ever try to ghost me
And MJ and Bill both agree, slay me with your eyes
You and I should be partners in crime
No more love online, head for bedside
How'bout L-M-I-R-L tonight?
Slay me with your eyes
You and I should be partners in crime
This must be what open heart surgery's like
Not a drop of painkiller in sight
Slay me with your eyes
Slay me with your eyes
Slay me with your eyes (you're kidding me)
Slay me with your eyes
