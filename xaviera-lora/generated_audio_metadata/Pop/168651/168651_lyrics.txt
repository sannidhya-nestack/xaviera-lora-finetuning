In your mind
Do I sound a little vague?
Do I sound a little crazy?
I am just
In your mind
An illusion
Do I sound a little
Do I sound a little like you
I am just what in your mind
Breathe, breathe, smile
Breathe, breathe, smile
Do I sound a little
Do I sound little?
I am just
What?
Being you're my
I am just
I am just
An illusion
Being you're my
Illusion
Do I sound a little
Do I sound a little
Beguiled
In your mind
In your mind
In your mind
I am just what
In your mind
