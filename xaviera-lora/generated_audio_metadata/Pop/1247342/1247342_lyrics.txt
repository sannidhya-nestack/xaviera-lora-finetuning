Every time we fight the tears start to fall
You say you're alright but I see it all
In your eyes a river of blood shed pain
Your waterworks caught in the pouring rain
Your waterworks falling down, tears and heartaches all around
In the storm where we both drown, your waterworks without a sound
Every time we fight the tears start to fall
You say you're alright but I see it all
In your eyes a river of unshared pain
Your waterworks start in the pouring rain
Your waterworks falling down
Tears and heartaches all around
In the storm where we both drown
Your water without a sound
Late at night, a silence, emotions flow
Words left unspoken but always known
Underneath the surface where the hurt resides
Your waterworks reveal the pain you hide
Your waterworks falling down
Tears and heartaches all around
In the storm where we both drown
You're a waterwork without a sound
Tryna hold you close but that distance grows
Every tear that falls in the river flows
Wishing I could take all your pain away
Your waterworks keep pouring out
Your waterworks falling down
Tears and heartaches all around
In the storm where we both drown
Your waterworks without a sound
As the dawn approaches drying all the tears
Hope begins to rise chasing all the fears
In the light of morning love will find its way
Your waterworks will end then we'll be okay
We love the sound as the dawn approaches drying all the tears
Hope begins to rise chasing all the fears
In the light of morning love will find its way
Your waterworks will end and we'll be okay
Your waterworks falling down
Tears and heartaches all around
In the storm where we both drown
Your waterworks without a sound
You're crying out your eyes
Where the storm of summer lies
Finding peace in the profound
Waterworks no longer found
