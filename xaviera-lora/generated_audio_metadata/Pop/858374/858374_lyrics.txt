I walk alone between the lines that lead me to the edge
I get so numb between my acting all the words I said
And so grows on the life we choose to be our only way
Inside my head I face the ghost that haunts me everyday
You're the one you put on me
I regret the time
We waste now to live
To let it be how we find recovery
It had to be this way
I'll have to wait'til I go, I'll surrender
I'm pretty sure it'll come to me
Am I the only one who knows what's worth?
You are the only one who set me free
I'll have to wait'til I go, I'll surrender
I'm pretty sure it'll come to me
Am I the only one who knows what's worth?
You are the only one who set me free
I'll have to wait'til I go, I'll surrender
Pretty sure it'll come to me
Am I the only one who knows what's worth?
You are the only one that set me free
I have to wait till I go, I surrender
I walk alone between the lines that lead me to the edge
I get so numb between my acts and all the words I said
And so goes on the life which used to be our only way
Inside my head I face the ghost that haunts me everyday
You're the one you put on me
I regret the time we waste
Now it's too late to let it be
How we find recovery
It had to be this way
I have to wait to let go, I surrender
I'm pretty sure you'll come to me
Am I the only one who knows what's worth
You are the only one who set me free
I have to wait to let go, I surrender
I'm pretty sure you'll come to me
Am I the only one who knows what's worth
You are the only one who set me free
I'll have to wait till I go, I surrender
Pretty sure you'll come to me
Am I the only one who knows what's worth
You are the only one who set me free
I'll have to wait till I go, I surrender
