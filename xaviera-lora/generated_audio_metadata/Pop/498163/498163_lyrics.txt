I'm singing this broken tune to you
Cause you linger in my head and I don't want this
Oh release me from hell
All the pain it takes me to keep you beneath my skin
Oh anger, anger, I'm gonna rinse myself of you
I'm gonna take control of what I say and do
You don't belong here
You don't belong here
You don't belong here with me
Fighting something you know will never fall
Made to take the last breath
They feed us every day
I just wanted to stand tall
But you crept up in my chest and took control
Oh anger, anger, I'm gonna rinse myself of you
I'm gonna take control of what I say and do
You don't belong here
You don't belong here
You don't belong here with me
You don't belong here with me
You don't belong here
You don't belong here
You don't belong here with me
