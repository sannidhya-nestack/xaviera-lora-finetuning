I want to make a new day between Tuesday and Wednesday
And bounce right out of the week
The clock would strike twelve at last and we'd still away
So fast a day for just you and me
Just like our own private island
Cause I need hours with you
To extend on an extra day for you
I'd love to sidestep time just us
We could slip off nice and smooth
24 hours with my sweet crush
A new day for you
Feeling bright as a daisy
We'd show up on Wednesday
Without missing a beat
My heart would be fully fed
My thirst for you newly quenched
A sweet secret to keep
I wanna take you and withdraw
I wanna pause the whole world
Because I want an extra day for you
I'd love to sidestep time just us
We could slip off nice and smooth
24 hours with my sweet crush
A new day for you
Our time is never enough
Let's cross the date line and just run off
I need more you but life just takes more me
Let's jump into this opening
I want an extra day for you
I'd love to sidestep time justice
We could slip off nice and smooth
24 hours with my sweet crush
A new day for you
