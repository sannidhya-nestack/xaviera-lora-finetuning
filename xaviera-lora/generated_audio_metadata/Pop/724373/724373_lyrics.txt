She said love don't hurt
Don't you know I think about you everyday
When you wake up I'm on your mind
Please don't leave me behind
Send me a pic, say I miss you (Send me a pic, say I miss you)
I ain't got nobody else, baby, this you (I ain't got nobody else, baby, this you)
If I was right there, I would kiss you
'Cause it's you and me when they gone away
I care less what they think
They don't know what we've been through
They say what they wanna say
But it's you and me when they gone away
It's you and me when they gone away
Why you got the window down
And it's cold outside
You won't speak
And I don't know why
I care less what they think
They don't know what we been through
They say what they wanna say
But it's you and me when they gone away
Why you got the window down and it's cold outside
You won't speak and I don't know why
You know I just wanna love you
