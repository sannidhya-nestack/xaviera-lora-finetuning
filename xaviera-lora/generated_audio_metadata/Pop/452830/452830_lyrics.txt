When you're lost in space with no place to land
You see in every face a friend who'll understand
But behind that warm, sunny atmosphere
Was the coldest place where it all came clear
There is poison beneath the purest ground
It makes me feel like a rocket slowing down
You can't get away, you can just pretend
You're not getting pulled into the wheels again
If you lose your faith to a dead end track
Will you waste your life trying to get it back?
There's no decisions to be made when you play it safe and sound
I can look brand new
But I'll feel like a rocket slowing down
I got to fly for a while
In a sky so blue
I got to make you smile
And though I wanted to
Could not touch down
And now I drift into space
But I just can't seem to home in on a different face
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da, da da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da, da da-da-da-da, da da-da-da-da, da da-da-da-da, da da-da-da-da, da da-da-da-da, da da-da-da-da, da da-da-da-da, da da-da-da-da, da da-da-da-da
And what I had was gone before I had the time to turn around
Yeah, now I feel like a rocket slowing down
I got to fly for a while, sky so blue
I got to make you smile, though I wanted to
I could not touch down, I could not touch down
there's poison beneath the purest ground
Now I feel like a rocket soaring high
