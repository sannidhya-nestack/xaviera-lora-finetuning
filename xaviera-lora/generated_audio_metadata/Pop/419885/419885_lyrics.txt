Take my hand, let's run away
Take my hand
We've got our lives, let's watch the stars tonight
Would you hold my hand under the moonlight?
Hold me close, don't let go
Hold me close
Look into my eyes and steal my soul
I give you my heart forever and all
Kiss me quick it's okay
Kiss me quick
You don't have to move or talk at all
Just play me a sample of song
You don't have to move or talk at all
Just play me a sample of soul
You don't have to move or talk at all
Just play me a simple love song
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
