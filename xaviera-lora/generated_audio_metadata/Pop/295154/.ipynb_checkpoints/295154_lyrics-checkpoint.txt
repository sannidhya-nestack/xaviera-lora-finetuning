Open your eyes to see
A life that they used to be
Hoping that it still remains
But no nothing stays the same
So you walk into the light
Hoping that you'll come to find
Some distant memory
A memory of you and me
When you find out that I'm gone
You'll find yourself falling
With no one to catch you
everything's gone but you
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving, moving, moving
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving, moving, moving
Gotta keep moving on
Ooh
When everything that you believe in
Has drifted away with no reason
You feel like it's all gone wrong
Go back to where you belong
When you find out that I'm gone
You find yourself falling
With no one to catch you
'Cause everything's gone but you
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving, moving, moving
You gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep movin', movin', movin'
You gotta keep movin' on
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Movin', movin', oh
Movin', movin', oh
Gotta keep moving on, gotta keep moving on, gotta keep moving, moving, moving, gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving on (Gotta keep moving on)
Gotta keep moving on (Moving on, moving on)
Gotta keep moving, moving, moving (Oh)
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving on (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Gotta keep moving on (Moving on, moving on)
Gotta keep moving, moving, moving
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving on (I'm moving on)
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving, moving, moving
Gotta keep moving on
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
