Oh my God she's so damn pretty
Looking at me mouthing every word of the songs that I sing
Smiles at me as she catches me staring
Looking New York pretty she could change everything
While all my walls are breaking voluntarily
As I sing for her in New York City
Whoa, whoa, oh
Every move, every breath, every word that you say
Whoa, whoa, oh
I'm coming home
Whoa, whoa, oh
I want you in the front row of my life now, baby
Whoa, whoa, oh
I said whoa, whoa, oh
New York
New York
Singing every word I've ever written
Everyone and everything in this room just fades away
And every kiss from you I imagine
Could be more than enough, girl, to make me stay
Well all my walls are breaking as she sings to me
From the front row of my gig in New York City
Woah, woah, every move, every breath, every word that you say
Woah, woah, woah
I'll be coming home
Whoa, whoa
I want you in the front row of my life now baby
Whoa, whoa
I said whoa, whoa
New York (New York, New York, New York, New York)
New York, New York City, I'm coming home
Every move, every breath, every word that you say
New York City, I'm coming home
Come home with me NYC to Mecca, Al-Mashawn
PM all weather, tough leather, we hot, both better
Took a lil bit to get here, whatever
They rappin, rappin, rappin what we hear from the speaker
They sellin, sellin, sellin all they souls to the demon
Thinkin they achievement, riches from beyond
Success is what you making, we made it all along
