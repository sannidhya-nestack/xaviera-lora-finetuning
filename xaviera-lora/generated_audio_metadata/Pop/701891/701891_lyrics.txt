It's no wonder why
I didn't fall apart
When you said goodbye
I'm a hard design
Not gonna cry, I might rush home
And while my wires might get crossed
My heart is made of chrome
I am a machine
I am a machine
I am a machine
I am a machine (I am a machine)
You're right (you're right)
I'm cold as ice
So steel your nerves tonight
It's fine to panic
Not manual, automatic
I am a machine (I am a machine)
I am a machine (I am a machine)
I am a machine (I am a machine)
I am a machine (I am a machine)
Operator raise the faders like they're elevators
I am a machine
I am a machine
I am a machine (I am a machine)
I am a machine (I am a machine)
I am a machine (I am a machine)
I am a machine (I am a machine)
