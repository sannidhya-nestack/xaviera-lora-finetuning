You fool around with your friends lying on the floor
You dress so fine, living in a perfect world
But once again what happens when it's all the same
And I wanna know the fans face yeah
Suddenly I just realized
We are moving to a different phase
Day by day, I know what happens now
That will make you through another day
It's right now
I don't wanna thank our love
Just fade away right now
I don't wanna thank, oh
You fool around with your friends lying on the floor
You dress so fine by living in the perfect world
But once again what happens when it's all the same
I don't want another fancy face yeah
Suddenly I just realized
We're moving to a different phase
Day by day I know what happens now
I will make it through another day
Cause right now I don't wanna think
Our love just fade away right now
I don't want a thing out of love
Just fade away (right now)
right now I don't want a thing (out of love)
Out of love, right now
I don't want to stay alone
Just fade away now
I don't want to stay
