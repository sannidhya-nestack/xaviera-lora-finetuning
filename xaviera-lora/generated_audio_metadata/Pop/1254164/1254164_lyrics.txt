Driving through tears
Driving through tears
It feels like I haven't
Seen you for years
Driving through tears
Driving through tears
Picture yourself in a car downtown
With neon lights and concrete skies
Someone calls you, your heart rate is slowing
A voice that's filled with goodbyes
Street lights flash, you're holding tight
Trying to make it to his side
Look for the love that's just out of sight
But he's gone
Driving through days
Driving through tears
It feels like I haven't
Seen you for years
Driving through tears
Driving through
Follow the road to the place where we met
Where we laughed and danced until dawn
But now it's a shrine to the love we had left
And memories of what is now gone
Cars pass by but I'm standing still
Wishing I could bring him back to life
My heart is breaking but I love him still
And he's gone
Driving through tears
Driving through tears
It feels like I haven't seen you for years
Driving through tears
Driving through tears
I drive on through the night and the rain and the pain
Thinking of the love that we shared
Memories like diamonds that shine so very bright
I really could've sworn that he'd care
Time after time I imagine that he's there
But reality sets in quickly and it hits me again
It hits me very hard again
That he's gone
Driving through tears
Driving through tears
It feels like I haven't
It's over for me
It's over for me
