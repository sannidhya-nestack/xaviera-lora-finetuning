If you keep waiting for the other shoe to drop
You're gonna keep getting what you got if you keep spinning
Round and round
You're never gonna really touch the ground
No one knows about tomorrow
No one knows what it will bring
I know it gets hard sometimes although it ain't easy
You get knocked down to the ground bruised and dirty
Get on up, shake it off, move on, believe me
It ain't perfect but you're worth it
If you keep running
All the time
You're never gonna see the signs
If you keep forcing
Everything
You're never gonna let love's roots dig in
No one knows about tomorrow
No one knows what it will bring
I know it gets hard sometimes
I know it ain't easy
You get knocked down to the ground bruised and dirty
Get on up shake it off move on believe me
It ain't perfect but sure worth it
It's not perfect but ain't it worth it
I'm not perfect, but hey, it's worth it
You're not perfect, but hey, it's worth it
We're not perfect, but ain't it worth it? This love is perfect
