We have both gone our separate ways
While everyone around still acts like nothing's changed
You went to the left and I went to the right
At a four way stop we both said goodbye
We're too tired to fight
We're too tired to try
We just couldn't get it right
But we made it
We made it out alive
You, me, and everyone else
We take it for granted and notice what is left
Hurt and pain and all the in between
It's times like these that make you see all the little things
We're too tired to fight
We're too tired to try
We just couldn't get it right
But we made it
We made it out alive
We were too tired to fight
We're too tired to try
We just couldn't get it right
But we made it, we made it out alive
We made it out alive
We made it, we made it out alive
