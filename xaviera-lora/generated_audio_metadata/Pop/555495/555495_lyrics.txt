To have is not to hold
So baby please don't go
your heart would just grow cold
If you'd go
You're always on my mind
Twenty-five to life
I'm gonna make you feel alright
Hold you close'til you're all tongue-tied
I'll be the first one in your sight
And the last one for you to say goodnight
I'll taste your dinner and your wine
Cut the sugar but I'll raise the spice
I'm gonna make your world so bright
So I will find you even in the blind
I'll do this all for you, you, you
To keep you happy and for good, good, good
Don't be a fool, obey my rules
I'll be your bride, your mom and your muse
To love is not to hold
So baby please don't go
your heart will feel so cold if you go
So I'll just rewrite your life to your Mr. Right
In my own paradise
You're always on my mind
25 to life
I'm the one you would desire
So surrender I don't compromise
Gonna burn your eyes with fire
If you be good someone else is right
No I don't like yelling or lies
So kiss my feet and apologize
I'll be your shadow'til you die
Even haunt you in the afterlife
You know you do this all for love, love, love
And I need a little more, more, more
When it comes to love, I'm a bit hardcore
I'm your wife, your mom and your home
To love is not to hold
So baby please don't go
your heart would feel so cold if you'd go
So I'll just rewrite your life, dear Mr. Wright
In my own paradise
You're always on my mind, 25 July
If you could only understand
All these things I demand
Are meant to make you mine till the end of time tonight
So I'll just rewrite your life to your Mr. Right
In my own paradise
You're always on my mind
Twenty-five to love
To love is not to hold
So baby please don't go
your heart will feel so cold
If you go
So I'll just rewrite your life to your Mr. Right
In my own paradise
You're always on my mind
25 July
