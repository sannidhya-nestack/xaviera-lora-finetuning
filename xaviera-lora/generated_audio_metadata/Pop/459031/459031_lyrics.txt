When I'm with you I watch the clock ticking down
Knowing that I only got so little time with you
Yeah I miss you days
Seem like forever it just doesn't taste the same
But without you, yeah I miss you
It's just like mercury's in retrograde
Does it work? It's not feeling so okay
For a while we're just living in the moment
You and I we get just a little closer
Uh huh, hi
Miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you
When with you we're stuck together we're connected
Crazy glue still stuck on you
Yeah, I miss you, hey
Can't smell the flowers when you're not around today
You're so far away and I miss you
Yeah, just like Mercury's in retrograde
Does it work? It's not feeling so okay
For a while we were just living in the moment
You and I, we can just stay a little closer
I miss you
Some how I don't know what to say
Anything you want baby that's okay
Just know I'm around the way and I keep you in my heart
Girl know that still it ain't the same when I'm gone
Know you wondering what's going on
Can't say if it's right or it's wrong
But I need you with me girl
You gotta know that
everything I have ain't hunger without you
And everything I ever did wrong I never meant to
So understand what I mean when I say that
I just can't walk away from this love
I know everything will be fine
Baby girl if we just take time
Right now is the way that it is
So I'ma say goodbye tonight
Can't smell the flowers when you're not around today
You're so far away and I miss you
It's just like Valkyries in retrograde
Does it work? It's not feeling so okay
For a while we'll just live in the moment
Am you in my way? (What's going on?)
Just get a little closer (Anything you want baby that's okay)
That's okay, that's okay
I, I, I miss you
I, I, I miss you
