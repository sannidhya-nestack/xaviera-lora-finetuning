I'm frozen, I'm frozen for you
When you walk around me so good
What I can't do you make me impatient
I know that I'm not enabling
But I make you feel high, high, high yeah
Listen to the song, listen to the song, listen to the song
Baby I'll write for you, listen to the song, listen to the song, listen to the song
Baby I'll write for you, listen to the song, listen to the song, listen to the song
Baby I'll write for you, listen to the song
Listen to summer, listen to sun
Baby I'm right for you
I know that I'm not in a plane
But I make you feel high, high, high, yeah
Listen to the sun, listen to the sun, my, my, my
Listen to the sun, baby, I write for you
Listen to the sun
Listen to sun, listen to sun, baby I'm right for you
Listen to sun, listen to sun, listen to sun, baby I'm right for you
Listen to sun, listen to sun, listen to sun, baby I'm right for you
