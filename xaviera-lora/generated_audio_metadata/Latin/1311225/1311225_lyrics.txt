Oh, call it off, he there, say my street poor
Yeah, anymore me, I know the crack devil
Don't let shadows, they destroy you
They can't like nobody, I put that on my mind, yeah
And you might see lasers in the sky
They say people never let any of us go
And you might see a guy that's coming in a world only I've fallen in, I can't go with you
