Don't you care, don't you know it's true
Do me a favor, pretend you're mine tonight
Pretend you love me tonight
Every day, every way, darling, I'm falling again
Pretend you love me tonight
Don't you care
Why'd you sit here all alone?
Hey, ooh
Hey, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pretend you're mine tonight
Do me a favor, come on over here
Pretend you love me tonight, mmm
Pretend you love me tonight
La la la, la la la la
La la la, la la la la
La la la, la la la la
Pretend you're mine tonight
Pretend you're mine tonight
Ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-dum, ba-ba-dumb
Ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Pretend you're mine tonight
Why are you sitting there all alone? Do me a favor, come on over here tonight
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Why are you sitting there all alone? Do me your favor, come on over here tonight
Pretend you're mine tonight
Pretend you're mine tonight
Don't you care, you should know it's true
Do me a favor
Pretend you're mine tonight
Pretend you're mine tonight
Pretend you're mine tonight
