Where do you go when you go out so late at night?
Maleha
Who do you dance for under those nightclub lights?
Maleha (ooh)
She's the dancing queen in her tight-clothed jeans
Maleha (ooh)
Sneaking in the nightclub at seventeen
Malaya likes to dance in the rain on the southern coast of Spain
And Malaya likes to walk on the beach under the moonlight
Ooh, ooh, Malaya, ooh
Every boy wants their number on her telephone
Malaya, ooh, she always tells them no
And goes home all alone
Malaya, ooh
Said every boy wants to be her when I love her
Malaya
She's a good girl and she still live with her mother
Malaya likes to dance in the rain on the southern coast of Spain
And Malaya likes to walk on the beach under the moonlight
Malaya, she's a tea beauty queen
And she has her own special style
Malaya steals the hearts from the boys with just her smile
Oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya, oh Malaya.
I said, "Where do you go?"
Malaya likes to dance in the rain
On the southern coast of Spain
And Malaya likes to walk on the beach
Under the moonlight beam
Maleha she's a teen beauty queen
And she has her own special style
Maleha steals the hearts from the boys with just her smile
No, Maleha, Maleha, Maleha, Maleha, Maleha
