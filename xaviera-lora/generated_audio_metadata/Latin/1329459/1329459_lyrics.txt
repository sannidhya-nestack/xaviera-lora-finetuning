When we met who knew that we
Would have red hot chemistry
Though our love don't make no sense and if they knew that'd be a mess
No one else would ever guess we'd be so instantly obsessed
They say love is just a game if this game had a name it's
Don't tell
If they find out about us they'll all try to divide us
Just tell them all to go to
Don't tell
If we just keep our lips sealed our secret can't be revealed
Just tell them all to go to
They see we're not meant to be
But we feel things they cannot see
The way you take me by the hand
They would never understand
People would all talk so rude
Tell us that they don't approve
They say love is just a game
If this game had a name it's
Don't tell
If they find out about us
They'll all try to divide us
Just tell them all to go too
Don't tell
They say love is just a game
If this game had a name it's
Don't tell
If they find out about us
They'll all try to divide us
Just tell them all to go too
Don't tell
If we just keep our lips sealed
Our secret can't be revealed
Just tell them all to go too
