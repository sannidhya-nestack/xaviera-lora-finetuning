Some say lives are predetermined
And fate's a seal that burns
There's never fortune, lots of pain
We are where we are on earth
But I say that's mucho loco
And we're not stuck right where we lie
The only way I've found to get ahead
Is open up my eyes and see the green lights
And keep my dreams inside
See the green lights
And the world will shine so bright
I made my plan, it's straight ahead
No limit where I'll go
I see streets lit up with miracles
Horizons full of hope
Let them call me mucho loco
But I can't live if I don't try
To find a life I really want to lead
I just open up my eyes and see the green lights
And keep my dreams inside
See the green lights
And the world will shine so bright
See the green lights
And keep my dreams inside
See the green lights
And the world will shine so bright
And the world will shine so bright
Shine so bright
