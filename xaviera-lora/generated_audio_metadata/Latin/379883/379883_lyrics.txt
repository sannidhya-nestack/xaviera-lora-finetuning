Down by the border where the flatlands run
There ain't no escaping from the burning Texas sun
Past Amarillo on the way to Tucumcari
I ran across my old friend Louie
He gave me a wink, I gave him a smile
We proceeded to head down the Mojo Mile
Stretch of Texas highway where a man can take a chance
Dancing with the devil on the Cadillac Ranch
You're it
I'm buzzin' to the FM
I'm buzzin'
Buzzin' to the FM of KBCD
Cruisin' through the snowstorm as far as eyes can see
A stretch of Texas highway where Louis took his chance
And rumbled with the devil on the Cadillac Ranch
Down by the border where flatlands run
There ain't no escaping from the burning Texas sun
I passed Amarillo on the way to Tucumcari
I ran across my old friend on the way
