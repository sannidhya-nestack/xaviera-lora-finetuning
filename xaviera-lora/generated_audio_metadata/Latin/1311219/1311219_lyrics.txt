Sippin' on the curse of an idea that's the curse of each verse
What is it worth? No, it cannot go that's the virtue of the universe
You keep it thirsty, it runs down the reassign
And no hope for you, it's just a sign
You can't love that devil inside
All hope for you, it's just a sign
God for love, everyone's safe off the nerve
But they ot there's something more
Just on the reassign
Feel on the verse, I'm an idea, thanks to God, to feature verse
What is it worth, don't it matter, that's the virtue in your verse
You give me verse, they run down, love in your sight
Ain't no hope for you, this gas is hot
You can't know that though it's so
Black to winter, black to weakness
But if you wanna sweat, start at the worst
My love speak as though it has perfecting out
Doin' good, like doin' good
Fuckin' with us, first time out of us
And let's be just, oh yes, perfect, thank God
He don't burst
He don't burst
