Way back in time, what's yours is mine, the fairest wheel moves on
Contain the wind, bring youth again, anachronistic dawn
I'm seventeen, when knowledge gleams, the mystery of the soul
Way back again, when time begins, to teach me how to know
Sister Senorita sings her high scale melody
Promising the wonders of full scale fallacy
Vacation from the commonplace, escaping to the pure
Sister Senorita comes a marching with the cure
One for Papa, one for Mama, one for Sally Mae
Share the vision, overload, calm the light of day
Faith a monstrous undertow, both evil and divine
Sticking with the program, may not pass the brush with time
Sister Senorita
Sings her half scale melody
Promising the wonders of full scale fallacy
Vacation from the commonplace
Escaping to the pure
Sister Senorita comes a marching with the cure
Hold me steady on my feet
It's life that's rushing by
Every ready elegance
A kiss and then goodbye
Sister Senorita sings her half scale melody
Promising the wonders of full scale fantasy
Vacation from the commonplace, escaping to the pure
Sister Senorita comes a-marching with the cure
Sister Senorita
The cure
