A year away from London and I'm back in the airport lounge
And instead of flight arrivals they played a very familiar sound
I thought I was going crazy when I got on a taxi cab
The radio was playing salsa was this really London town
You're gonna like it
I bet you're gonna like it
That's why I'm coming back
You're gonna like it
I bet you gonna like it (you gonna make it now)
You gonna like it
I bet you gonna like it
You gonna like it
I bet you gonna like it
Some more you came to see us playing when nothing was on the ground
And really we are not complaining'cause you always pay my round
We played it and we liked it as we kicked around this town
Meeting people who were happy just to see us getting down
You gonna like it
I bet you gonna like it
You gonna like it
That's why I'm coming back
I bet you gonna like it
You gonna like it
Mamita sound yeah
You gonna like it
And I'm bringing you my sound
You gonna like it
I bet you gonna like it
You're gonna like it, I bet you're gonna like it, you're gonna like it, that's why I'm coming back
You're gonna like it, I bet you're gonna like it
You gonna like it
Mamita buena, sabrosa
En Nueva York se botó
El ritmo rico de salsa
Que el grupo mañana trajo
You gonna like it
Eh, papaya, papaya
You gonna like it
I bet you gonna like it
Yoku balakila hektate num dum dum
Tikiriki pam pam pam pam
Para que goce con mi sabor
Mira, vayalo, mira, vayalo, mira, vayalo
Que esta muy salsa
Esta es la salsa sabrosa
Y ahora la cosa se pone
Para que goce el trombón
