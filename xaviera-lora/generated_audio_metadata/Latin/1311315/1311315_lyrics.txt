So let me see you
You got the high don't go crazy
I just said I don't know
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
If I make a steady shot
I'll put your mask in place
And throw it on you if you so don't
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
You've meant to be
I've decided I'm missing you
(Oh oh oh oh)
I love the feeling
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Get off the field, yes, boy, baby
Get off the field, yes, boy, baby
I just made a wheel
Got the handle to be a stand-up and a dup-dup
(Oh, oh, oh)
But that's the key, sure
I'll put the best in the door, then I'll only floor
Movement in me, every thought that's from within me
Head of the buildings
Head of the buildings
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Out of the wilderness
Forever
Forever
