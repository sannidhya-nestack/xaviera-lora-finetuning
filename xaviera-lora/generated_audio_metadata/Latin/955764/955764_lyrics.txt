If you want me, I will surely drown
Waves are rising up in me
If you need me, then come on down
Don't expect the world, but you'll have me
Someone to talk it up, someone to talk you down
Someone to talk it up, someone to talk you down
Get ready for love, get ready for love
Get ready for love, get ready for love
Get ready for love, get ready for love
Get ready for love, get ready for love
If you love me, then come around
Scratch that itch that runs in you
If you want it, we'll work it out
Then you'll see just what I want to do
Someone to talk it up
Someone to talk you down
Someone to talk it up
Someone to talk you down
Get ready for love
Get ready for love, get ready for love
Get ready for love, get ready for love
Get ready for love, get ready for love
Get ready for love, get ready for love
Someone to talk it up, someone to talk you down
Someone to talk it up, someone to talk you down
Get ready for love
Get ready for love
Get ready for love
Get ready for love
Get ready for love
Get ready for love
Get ready for love
Get ready for love
Get ready for love
Get ready for love
Woo woo woo
Hey
Get ready for now
