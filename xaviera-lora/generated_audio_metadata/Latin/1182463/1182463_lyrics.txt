My Lena, say you're my ballena
She stole my heart in a cabana
I still can't listen to Santana
I need my guy to see my Lena, na, na, na
My Lena, na, na, na, na
Woah, mmm
Her hips did all the talking
I knew I was a dead man walking
There's no defense against those curves
Can't say it wasn't worth the pain I endured from Elena
Say you're mine but Elena
She stole my heart in a cabana
I still can't listen to Santana
I need my guy to see my lane, na-na-na-na
My lane, na-na-na-na, whoa, mmm
I had no doubt she'd be troubled
Her smile had me seeing double
I love the places she takes me
So not knowing where she is is making me crazy for Elena
Say you're mine but Elena
She stole my heart in a cabana
I still can't listen to Santana
I need my guy to see my Elena na na na na
My Elena na na na na
Whoa
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Madalena, say you're my ballena
She stole my heart in a cabana
I still can't listen to Santana
I need my guy to see Madalena
Say, "Yeah, my ballina
She stole my heart in a cabana"
I still can't listen to Santana
I need my guy to see my lean, nah, nah, nah, nah
My lean, nah, nah, nah, nah
