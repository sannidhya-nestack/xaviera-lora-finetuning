When I got to Auburn Yarrowville
Peppers were to blame
My tongue she was engulfed in flame
And it made my language spicy
My future dicey
But I stayed
But I stayed
Times Square and Jalapeno Land
The habaneros gather there
Strike up the mariachi band
And let the trumpets blare
My future Dicey
I stayed, but I stayed
What you feel is what you get in jalapeno land
If you can't stand the heat
You can always go back to blend
And back to the land of white bread
My future dicey
But I stayed
My future dicey
But I stayed
But I stayed
