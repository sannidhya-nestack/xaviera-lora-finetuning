Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Sexy whispers
Sexy whispers
Sexy whispers
Sexy whispers
Always on the phone
Always hearing your sexy whispers
Don't care where we are
Always time for your sexy whispers
Never pressed delete
I got a love on my cellphone
Kinda think it's neat
Sexy whispers, I got your number
Sexy whispers, love on my cellphone
Sexy whispers, just got the right tone
Sexy whispers, you got my number
Sexy whispers, in science of wonder
Time to do my job
All I hear is your sexy whispers
Guess we spend a lot
Got a lot of those sexy whispers driving in my car
But you know that I'll use my hands free
Don't care where we are
Always need our love on my cell phone
Sexy whispers, you got my number
Sexy whispers, it's science, so wonder
Sexy whispers, love on my cell phone
Sexy whispers, just got the right tone
Ooh, sexy whispers
Ooh, sexy whispers
Ooh, sexy whispers
Ooh, sexy whispers
Always on the phone
Always hearing your sexy whispers
Don't care where we are
Always time for your sexy whispers
Even when you text
Still I'm hearing your sexy whispers
Wonder what comes next
Next to full of your sexy whispers
Sexy whispers love on my cell phone
Sexy whispers just got the right tone
Sexy whispers you got my number
Sexy whispers in science of wonder
Sexy whispers love on my cell phone
Sexy whispers just got
The right tone
Sexy whispers
You got my number
Sexy whispers
In science and wonder
Sexy whispers
Love on my cell phone
Sexy whispers
Just got the right tone
Sexy whispers
You got my number
