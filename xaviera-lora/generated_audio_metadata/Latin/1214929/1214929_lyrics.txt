Hey Felicia, te amo
Tu eres mi destino
The sound you hear's the fire of
Sirens in our barrio
Hey Felicia, that's no cure
For that wounded heart of yours
Try to fill the hole in your soul
Careful you don't overdose
Ghetto bird hovers over us
Calling in for more backup
Won't be long'til they arrive
Play it wrong you won't survive
Hey Felicia, it's too soon
You were born to make men swoon
No one wants to see you lose
the needle is wound
Hey Felicia
Hey Felicia
Heavily shot
Damn all
Good rats and the alley cats
Time to leave them in the past
Romeos and dead end roads
Time to bid them adios
Hey Felicia te amo
Tu eres mi destino
The sound you hear is the fire of
Sirens in our body oh
Hey Felicia
Hey Felicia
Hey Felicia
Hey Felicia, take a moment
