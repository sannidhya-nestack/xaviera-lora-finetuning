Ooh, there was a shadow standing next to me
Ooh, the light was dim I could not see
Ooh, but I felt your touch so subtly
Ooh, within seconds I fall into a dream
I was a dream you kissed me so intimately
You held my body so tight I could not breathe
Oh still I knew who I wanted you to be
That meant I knew mysteriously
Who am I fooling to think he would be with me?
When there are so many women out there he could see
Why do I feel like we're supposed to be?
When my reality is my only company
I was a dream you kissed me so intimately (yeah)
You held my body so tight I could not breathe (yeah)
Though I was still I knew who I wanted you to be (yeah)
That man I knew mysteriously
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I was a dream you kissed me so intimately
You held my body so tight I could not breathe
Though I was still under who I wanted you to be
The man I knew
Mysteriously, I feel you making your way over to me (that man in blue)
I hold my breath, waiting for you (mysteriously)
Could this be real? Is this a dream?
What am I feeling? What does this mean? (mysteriously)
I feel you making your way over to me
I hold my breath, waiting for you (mysteriously)
Could this be real? Is this a dream?
What am I feeling? What does this mean? (mysteriously)
I feel you making your way over to me
I hold my breath waiting to see
Could this be real is this a dream
What am I feeling what does this mean
I feel you making your way over to me
I hold my breath waiting to see
Could this be real is this a dream
What am I feeling what does this mean
