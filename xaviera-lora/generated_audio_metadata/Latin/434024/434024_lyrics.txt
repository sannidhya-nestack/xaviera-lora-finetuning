I took some time to leave my mind
Just left home on my way to you
Now I find myself on these warm white sands
Feeling the heat and the cool sweet sweat of my skin
Watching a beautiful stranger to hold my hand
Show me what it means to feel alive again
Watching a beautiful stranger to hold my hand
Show me what it means to feel alive again
As we dance around the fire, you and I, our bodies move as one
You're more than I desire, in your eyes, I found paradise
As we dance around the fire, you and I our bodies move as one
You're more than I desire, in your eyes I found paradise
Esperando que un extraño tome mi mano
Y me deje sentir viva otra vez
Esperando que un extraño me ame
Wanting a beautiful stranger to hold my hand
Show me what it means to feel alive again
Wanting a beautiful stranger to hold my hand
Show me what it means to feel alive again
To feel alive again
I've been wanting a beautiful stranger to hold my hand
Show me what it means to be alive again
These are the words you said to me
