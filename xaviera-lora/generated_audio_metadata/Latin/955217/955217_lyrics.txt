Lost in his memories he sits on the banks of the Rio Grande
He stares at the watery living that night long ago
When the rain swollen river carried away
The only love of his life
With tears in his voice he whispers to her alone
Adios Angel, heaven knows why
You were taken away from this world
So young Caridad
Adios Angel, never goodbye
For here in my heart we grow old together
He promised her life would be better there on the Texas side
He said hold on to me and I'll swim us across in the dark
But the current was swift, it pulled her from him
She vanished calling his name
She calls to him still as he wanders the river's edge
Crying Adios Angel, heaven knows why
You were taken away from this world so young, Carita
Adios Angel, never goodbye
For here in my heart we grow old together
She calls to him still, this time she won't let go
He cries adios angel, heaven knows why
You were taken away from this world so young, Carida
Adios Angel, never goodbye
For here in my heart we grow old together
Here in my heart we grow old
Adios Angel
