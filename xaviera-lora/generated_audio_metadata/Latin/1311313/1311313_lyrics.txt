Feed us up
Is you still with us?
I've got to get enough
I've been worried all this is an ache
You can't regret your mother, oh shit
I'm just feeding us up
Put that roughness away from me
Make your noise all this day too
We start to doubt fit the wind can't spit for us
Overwhelmed by the world fit the most too
In the length of our life you grab the window for us
We're among the bad, the empty and trust
We don't look for us, we shed for us
First thought I came one day with it
I'm sweet as talk
You still feel my eyes tight but don't let it know
I won't worry all this is an ache
You came, we cried your mother was shit
And you sweet as talk
But now I'm dancing right in front of you
Sweet as talk
He's too still for ice that clouds are winning, no
I won't worry all this if and if you came
We brought your mind to ocean and we speedin' us up
We'll never dance away from you
One goes to stay but the next tellin' all me's lies, better set my phone
If I run they can make try, no more kiddo can't tell how many people are
Who knows the difference but one up when you know she false so when she numberin' gone
I'm a darling if you miss me hey, say goodnight
Come speed us up
If you still wanna step back to win and love
I won't worry all this Italy, UK
We've watched you battle ocean now you speed us up
We'll never dance away from you
Speed us up
He's still standing while he's got the door open, no
I won't worry or be sick that late, you can't
Regret you had all the shit, now you're spitting us off
When I really passed away from you
And his fearless love would never dance away from him
