Baby I was frozen
My heart was not open
To love somebody new
Then you broke through
A blade of light
On a cold night
Like this
Ice and fire
Ice and fire
Drowning in a pool of desire
Only one survivor
In ice and fire
Baby don't sweat it
Soon you'll et
How you touched my skin
How I let you in
How we crossed the floor
How you begged for more
Like this we're like ice and fire
Ice and fire
Drowning in a pool of desire
Only one survivor in ice and fire
We take a step
We can't ignore
What we feel
We never felt before
Like this
Like this
We're like
Eyes of fire
Ice and fire drowning in a pool of desire
Only one survivor in ice and fire
Ice and fire drowning in a pool
With you, only one, only one
Survivor in ice and fire, ice and fire
In ice and fire
In ice and fire
