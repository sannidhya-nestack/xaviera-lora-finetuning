Take my hand and let me dance with you
Take my hand I'll lead you onto the dance floor
Lost in rhythm, lost in love
Together both of us will rise above
Take my hand and let me dance with you
Take my hand I'll lead you onto the dance floor
I'll hold you close, we'll let the music play
Together we can dance the night away
Let's dance
In this moment we are free
Let's dance
Lost in love, just you and me, let's dance
Every touch ignites the flame, let's dance
This is more than just a game, let's dance
Take my hand and let me dance with you
We can let this moment last forever
Every move and every beat
With every pulse we feel the heat
Take my hand and let me dance with you
We'll keep dancing'til the end of time
Our hearts together in harmony
We'll dance together eternally
Let's dance
In this moment we are free
Let's dance
Lost in love just you and me
Let's dance
Every touch ignites a flame
Let's dance
This is more than just a game
Let's dance
In this moment we are free
Let's dance
Lost in love just you and me
Let's dance
Every touch ignites a flame
Let's dance
This is more than just a game
Love stamps
