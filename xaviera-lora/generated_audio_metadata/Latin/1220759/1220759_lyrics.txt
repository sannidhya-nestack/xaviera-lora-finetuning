¿Lo quieres como hielo o fuego?
Fire
Baby I was frozen
My heart was not open to love somebody new
Then you broke through
A blade of light on a cold night
Like this
Ice and fire
Ice and fire, drowning in a pool of desire
Only one survivor in ice and fire
Baby don't sweat it
Soon you'll et how you touched my skin
How I let you in
How we crossed the floor
How you begged for more
Like this, we're like ice and fire (ay como fuego amor)
Ice and fire, drowning in a pool
Full of desire
Sold up on thee
Only one survivor
In ice and fire
We take a step
We can't ignore
What we feel we never felt before
Like this, like this, like this
We're like
Ice and fire, ice and fire
Drowning in a pool
Of desire, soul, and pity
Only one survivor
In ice and fire
Weston, Weston, Weston in the fire
Weston, Weston, Weston in the fire
Running through with you
Un mar contigo (Solo, solo, solo, solo, solo, solo, solo)
Only one (Solo, solo, solo, solo, solo, solo, solo)
Only one survivor (Solo, solo, solo, solo, solo, solo)
In ice and fire (Muestrame, muestrame)
Muestrame tu fuego (Ice and fire)
Muestrame, muestrame tu fuego (Ice and fire)
Muestrame, muestrame tu fuego (Muestrame, muestrame)
West of it need fire, need ice and fire
