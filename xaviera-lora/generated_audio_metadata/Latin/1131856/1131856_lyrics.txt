What is love? Is in the blood, is just a way of life
What is love? Is everything, is something you can't hide
What is love? Is it the way you look into my eyes
What is love? The things you do that take me by surprise
Amor is to love you, amor is to care
Amor is to people with something to share
Amor for their Spanish, amor for their French
Love in any language always means the same
What is love? Is it the joy of having you around?
What is love? Is it the way you lift me when I'm down?
What is love? Is it a dream no one can do without?
What is love? It's in the words that I am singing out
Amor it's to love you, amor it's to care
I'm more into people with something to share
I'm more for their Spanish, I'm more for their French
Love in any language always means the same
La la la la ya la
La la la la la
La la la la ya la
La la la la ya
La la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la
(What is love?)
A no Brasil se fala de curtir
(What is love?)
Dis en français tout mot petit chéri
(What is love?)
Es la emotion que despierdas en mi
(What is love?)
Around the world they all know what it means
A more it's to love you, a more it's to care
A more it's to people with something to share
A more for their Spanish, a more for their French
Love in any language always means the same
I'm always to love you
I'm always to care
I'm always to people with something to share
I'm more for their Spanish
I'm more for their French
Love in any language
Always means the same
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Brr-brr-brr-brr-brr-brr-brr!
Amor is to love you, amor is to care
Amor is to people with something to share
Amor for their Spanish, amor for their French
Not being in their language always means the same
