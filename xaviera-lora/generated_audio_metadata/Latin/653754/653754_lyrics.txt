There's a tension tonight in the kitchen
There's a sizzling spice in the air
You turn with the whirl of your apron
But the maitre d' isn't there
A flame erupts on the stove top
A wine glass falls to the floor
And try as you may to regain control
It's no use, you're paying the price
For playing with spice
The knives have been freshly sharpened
The stockpot's beginning to boil
You hurriedly toss the new salad
With specific infusions of oil
The guests gather round the chef's table
When a voice cries out in alarm
She turns to you and you understand it's too late
You're paying the price for playing Will Spice
The temperature's hot in the kitchen
There's a sizzling spice in the air
You run to the walk-in cooler
But there's no escape even there
At first it all seems so adventurous
A pinch, a peck, why not?
Now try as you may, you can't get past you
The taste for paying the price
For playing with spice
For playing with spice
For playing with spice
For playing with spice
