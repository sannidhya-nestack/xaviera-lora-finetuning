Write it down, write it down
It's too much to remember
Write it down, write it down
To age I surrender
I have to write it down, I have to write it down
I have to write it down
I can't remember
Buy some milk at the store
Call the van to come at four
Repair the latch on the door
And sew up that old shirt that tore
I have to write it down
I have to write it down
I have to write it down
I can't remember
There is no gas in the car, nothing in the cookie jar
Fix Amelia's handlebar and call up my friends from afar
I have to write it down, I have to write it down, I have to write it down
I can't remember
Pick up the laundry at the mall
Plant tulips in the fall
Wash the carpet in the hall
Will I remember it all?
I have to write it down, I have to write it down, I have to write it down
I can't remember
Write it down, write it down
It's too much to remember
Write it down, write it down
To age I surrender
I have to write it down
I have to write it down
I have to write it down
I can't remember
I have to write it down, I have to write it down, I have to write it down
So I'll remember
