Somethin'bout you is different
Some kinda energy's messin'
With all the chemicals in my brain
Feel the temperature risin'
That look in your eyes paralyzin'
Forever you'll never leave in my vain
I ain't no reader
I ain't no reader
Heart is racing here now
Never wanna wait out
I want you right up to the end
Oh
You know what I'm feeling
Even if it doesn't make sense
You don't have to guess now
You're a minor eater
Minor eater
Something'bout you is different
Some kind of energy's messing
With all the chemicals in my brain
Feel the temperature rising
That look in your eyes paralyzing
Forever you'll never leave in my veins

Heart is racing here now
Never wanna wait out
I want you right up to the end
Oh
You know what I'm feeling
Even if it doesn't make sense
You don't have to guess now
You're my narrator
My narrator
Oh
You know what I'm feeling even if it doesn't make sense
You don't have to guess now
You're a minor eater
Minor eater
