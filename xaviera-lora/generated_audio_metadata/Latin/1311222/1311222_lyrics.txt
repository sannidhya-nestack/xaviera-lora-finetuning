I don't care if I look good, who the girl killin' good, I do my feelings good, my feelings good
I don't care if I look good, who the girl killin' good, I do my feelings good
This is a loop, yes,'cause I caught the finger
You're more the loner and we talk about all the lies
Let me know when all is said for the minute
I thought you'd get pretty, I got a knife
That's all I need, now we need these eyes
Move it like I do, but though I have time
Well I done lived all my life but you left
Was there any stuff for most of our life?
All can find good
Do the girl killin' good
I do my killin' good
All can find good
Do the girl killin' good
I do my killin' good
I don't care if I'm good, good if you're feeling good
I do my feeling good, good if you're feeling
I don't care if I'm good, good if you're feeling good
I do my feeling good
Oh yeah if I could
Do love your killer good
I do my killer good
My killer good
Oh yeah if I could
Do love your killer good
I do my killer good
