Hey Felicia, te amo
Tu eres mi destino
The sound you hear's the fire of
Sirens in our barrio
Hey Felicia, that's no cure
For that wounded heart of yours
Try to fill the hole in your soul
Careful you don't overdose
Good rats and the alley cats
Time to leave them in the past
Romeos and dead end roads
Time to bid them adios
Hey Felicia, te amo
Tu eres mi destino
The sound you hear is the fire of
Sirens in our body, oh
Hey Felicia
Hey Felicia
Hey Felicia
Good rats and the alley cats
Time to leave them in the past
Romeos and dead end roads
Time to bid them adios
Hey Felicia, te amo
Do it as we destined, oh
The sound you hear is the five of
Sirens in our body, oh
Hey Felicia
Hey Felicia
Hey Felicia
