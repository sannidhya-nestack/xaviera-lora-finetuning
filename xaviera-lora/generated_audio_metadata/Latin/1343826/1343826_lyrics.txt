The bar starts to close and a young girl named Rose is still sipping a drink in the corner
Tom's standing in the bar says I'll get you a car or I could call you a cab for a quarter
She shakes her head and says I should've known better than to hope Joe would be here tonight
I'll be okay, sometimes it makes me crazy
When I'm on a raymoons on the rise
Monterey moon in the sky
Just like the one we danced to that night
After leaving a cantina like this
We sealed our love with a kiss
Monterey moon don't you lie
I feel a promise of love in your light
Can I trust what my heart wants to do under a Monterey moon?
She starts to leave and Tom says that he knows exactly how she must be feeling
His girl is a door, left him six months before
And he ain't talked to no one who's seen her
He pours her a drink, says it's a shame, don't you think
To be wasting this night on goodbyes
Maybe it's fate that made you stay so late
With that Monterey moon on the rise, she said
Monterey moon in the sky
Just like the one we danced to that night
After leaving a cantina like this
We sealed our love with a kiss
Monterey moon, don't you lie
Just keep on working your magic tonight
I'm falling for somebody new
Under a Monterey moon
Margarine moon, don't you lie
Just keep on working your magic tonight
I'm falling for somebody new
Under a margarine moon
