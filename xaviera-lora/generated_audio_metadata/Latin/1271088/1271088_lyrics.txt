Across the border in Mexico
I found a place to go to have a good time
Where a dollar gets you the best tequila money can buy
All the pretty señoritas
Have a one too many margaritas look in their eyes
The moon is full
It's happy hour at the lonely bowl
Happy hour at the lonely pool
The chili's hot and the drinks are cold
Having a good time's the only rule
When it's happy hour at the lonely pool
Bartender pour me another shot
The last one I got is already gone
Armin' on the whole room swayin'
To the beat of a Freddy Fender song
We'll raise the roof, dancin' on the ceiling
Then party down'til the break of dawn
The moon is full
It's happy hour at the Lonely Bowl
Happy hour at the Lonely Bowl
The chili is hot and the drinks are cold
Havin' a good time's the only rule
When it's happy hour at the Lonely Bowl
Bartender pour me another shot
The last one I got is already gone
Arm and arm the whole room swaying
To the beat of a Freddy Fender song
Raise the roof dancing on the ceiling
Then party down'til the break of dawn
The moon is full, it's happy hour at the lonely bowl
Happy hour at the lonely pool
The chili's hot and the drinks are cold
Having a good time's the only rule
When it's happy hour at the lonely pool
