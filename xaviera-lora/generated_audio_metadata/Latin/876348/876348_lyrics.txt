There's something'bout that girl (yeah)
She's all up in my world (oh, oh)
She acts like she don't know
But when she moves it shows
There's something'bout that girl
There's something'bout that girl (oh, oh)
She's a precious pearl (so precious)
And when she smiles she's shimmer
Her eyes begin to glimmer
There's something'bout that girl (hey yeah)
She works on the magnifica (magnifica)
Dancing Rosalita (yeah, yeah)
We do the Lombarda
Or a slow tango
Oh no
Something'bout that girl (something'bout that girl)
Something'bout that girl (hey, something'bout that girl)
Yeah
She moves like a magnet in the midnight heat
Drawing everything everyone to the beat
You try to pretend that you don't care
You try to resist but you don't have a prayer
There's something about that girl
Take her for a whirl
Take her anywhere
But boy you best beware
There's something'bout that girl
She works on the magnifica
Singing Rosalita
My heart's a piñata
She beats at night and day
Hold it, yeah
There's something'bout that girl (something'bout that girl)
I'm all up in her world (I'm in her world)
My blood begins to simmer (yeah)
Put the light on dimmer
There's something'bout that girl (something'bout that girl)
There's something'bout that girl
