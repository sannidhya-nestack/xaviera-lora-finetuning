Snow is falling, lights are glowing
Hearts are open, love keeps showing
Dancing shadows on the street tonight
Every step we take, the stars ignite
Feel the river, bells collide
Future Christmas amplified
Sing it louder
Let it be a timeless love and harmony
Shine this Christmas, light the sky
Feel the magic, you and I
Every heartbeat, every song
Keeps us dancing all night long
Shine this Christmas, take my hand
Turn the world to wonderland
With the music we'll believe
This is Christmas
Twenty-six
Voices rising, choirs blending
Past and future never ending
Jazzy whispers with a neon glow
Orchestras dancing in overflow
Feel the rhythm
Bells collide, future Christmas amplified
Sing it louder, let it be
A timeless love in harmony
Shine this Christmas, light the sky
Feel the magic, you and I
Every heartbeat, every song
Keeps us dancing all night long
Shine this Christmas
Take my hand
Turn the world to wonderland
With the music we'll believe
This is Christmas, say yes
Twenty-three to six
Sleigh bells ringing (oh-oh)
Future singing (oh-oh)
Love is bringing us alive
Choir's soaring (oh-oh)
Beats imploring (oh-oh)
This is where our dreams collide
Shine this Christmas, light the sky
Feel the magic, you and I
Every heartbeat, every song
Keeps us dancing all night long
Shine this Christmas, take my hand
Turn the world to wonderland
With the music we'll believe
This is Christmas
Twenty-three states
