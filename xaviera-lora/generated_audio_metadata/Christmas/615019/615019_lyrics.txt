Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host
Host proclaim, Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Christ by highest heaven adored
Christ the everlasting Lord
Late in time behold Him come, Offspring of the Virgin's womb.
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see, Hail the incarnate Deity.
Pleased as man with man to dwell, Jesus or Emmanuel.
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Mild He lays His glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth
Risen with healing in his wings
Light and life to all he brings
Hail the Son of Righteousness
Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace
Hark! The herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
