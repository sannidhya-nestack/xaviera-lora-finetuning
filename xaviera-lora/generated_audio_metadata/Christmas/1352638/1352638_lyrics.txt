Hmm
Hmm, hmm
Hmm
Snow falls slow like the dream on rewind
Lights blur soft in the back of my mind
City whispers hum a low lullaby
Jingle bell blues, they're drifting through
Soft and sweet like morning dew
Jingle bell blues, a hasten view
Frost on the glass draws maps to nowhere
Warm breath fades like secrets in air
Shadows dance but no one's there
Tick-tock, the clock won't move
Tick-tock
Caught in the groove
Jingle bell blues, they're drifting through
Soft and sweet like morning dew
Jingle bell blues, a hazy view
Midnight calls in, whispers thin
Echoes of where I've been
The chill bites deep, but I let it in
Oh, oh, oh, oh
