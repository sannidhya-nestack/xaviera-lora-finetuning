Frosty air, it bites my nose
Snowflakes twirl like ballerinas
Hand in hand with little toes
Dancing like a wild hyena
Rudolph's nose lights up the night
Candy cane paths in moonlight glow
Santa's elves in shoes so bright
Twirl and leap like stars in show
Come and join the merry dance
Around the tree we spin and prance
The laughter ringing pure and true
Santa's elves with God crew
Tinkling bells and joyful cheers
Every twirl chases our fears
Stockings hung with dreams inside
On this ride let's spin and glide
Silent night, but hearts aloud
Magic sweeping through the crowd
In this wintery wonder dream
We're the music, we're the team
Come and join the merry dance
Around the tree, we spin and prance
The laughter ringing pure and true
Santa's house, we've got a crew
Come and join the merry dance
Around the tree we spin and prance
The laughter ringing pure and true
Santa's house, we've got a crew
