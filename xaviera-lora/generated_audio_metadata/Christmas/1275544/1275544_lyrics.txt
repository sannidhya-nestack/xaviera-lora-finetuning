Snow is falling, black and white
Wrapping us in pure delight
Children's laughter fills the air
Joy and love are everywhere
By the hearth, the fires glow
In our hearts, warmth we know
Winter's embrace soft and kind
In this season peace we find
Underneath the twinkling sky
Christmas love will never die
Candles flicker, windows green, holiday
Like a dream, gingerbread and sweet delights
Magic moments, festive nights
By the heart, the fires glow
In our hearts, warmth we know
Wonders embrace, soft and kind
In this season peace we find
Underneath the twinkling sky
Christmas love will never die
Candles flicker, windows clean
Holiday like a dream
Gingerbread and sweet delights
Magic moments, festive nights
Battle hearts, the fires glow
In our hearts, warmth we know
Winters embrace, soft and kind
In the season peace we find
Underneath the twinkling sky
Christmas love will never die
Holding hands and sharing dreams
Life is more than what it seems
In this time of hope and cheer
Love grows stronger every year
Windsor's embrace, soft and kind
In the season peace we find
Underneath the twinkling sky
Christmas love will never die
