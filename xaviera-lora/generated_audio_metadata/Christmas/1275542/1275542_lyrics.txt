Fire soft, the lights are lit
Outside the world is draped in snow
Your laughter fills this quiet room
Like Christmas lights in perfect gloom
Underneath the mistletoe I see your smile
It's just us two for a little while
The world can wait, it's you and me
Wrapped in love on Christmas Eve
The scent of pine, the candle's beam
Feels like we're living in a dream
I hold you close, your hands in mine
This love's the greatest gift to find
Underneath the mistletoe I see your smile
It's just us two for a little while
The world can wait, it's you and me
Wrapped in love on Christmas Eve
The scent of pine, the candle's dream
Feels like we're living in a dream
I hold you close, your hands in mine
This love's the greatest gift to find
Underneath the mistletoe I see your smile
It's just us two for a little while
The world can wait, it's you and me
Wrapped in love on Christmas Eve
The stars above are shining bright
But nothing glows like you tonight
In your eyes I see it clear
My heart belongs to you my dear
Underneath the mistletoe I see your smile
It's just us two for a little while
The world can wait, it's you and me
Wrapped in love on Christmas Eve
Wrapped in love, just you and me
On this perfect Christmas Eve
