Christmas is a-coming and the geese are getting fat
Please to put a penny in the old man's hat
If you haven't got a penny then a hey penny will do
If you haven't got a hey penny then God bless you
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
Merry Christmas to your neighbor and may God bless you
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
Merry Christmas to your neighbor and may God bless you
Christmas is a coming and the lights are on the tree
Hang up your stocking for all to see
If you haven't got a stocking then a little sock will do
If you haven't got a little sock then God bless you
God bless you, gentlemen God bless you
Merry Christmas to your neighbor and may God bless you
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
Merry Christmas to your neighbor and may God bless you
If you haven't got a thing for me, then God bless you
Christmas is a coming and the egg is in the nog
Please to let me sit around your old yule log
If you'd rather I didn't sit around and stand around I'll do
If you'd rather I didn't stand around then God bless you
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
Merry Christmas to your neighbor and may God bless you
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
Merry Christmas to your neighbor and may God bless you
Christmas days are coming, it's the season of good cheer
Let's all sing a carol for the brand new year
If you haven't got a carol, then a jolly song will do
If you haven't got a jolly song, then God bless you
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
Merry Christmas to your neighbor and may God bless you
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
Merry Christmas to your neighbor and may God bless you
If you haven't got a thing for me
Even God bless you!
Christmas is a-coming and the geese are getting fat
Least to put a penny in the old man's hat
If you haven't got a penny then a hey penny will do
If you haven't got a hey penny then God bless you
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
Merry Christmas to your neighbor and may God bless you
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
Merry Christmas to your neighbor and may God bless you
If you haven't got a thing for me, then God bless you
