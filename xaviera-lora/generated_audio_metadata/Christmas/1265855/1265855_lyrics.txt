When the snowflakes start to fall
Crystal wonders crowding all
Twinkling eyes of the Lord in each design
In the stillness of the night
Everything is pure and bright
We gather near, the sacred moment feels divine
Oh, I see His love in every flame tonight
The magic of this time makes everything feel right
Yes, it's warmth in the gentle blue outside
Christmas Eve will cherish every sight
By the fire stories told
Ancient carols, hearts of gold
Reflecting in the dances of the flame
Children's whispers, soft and sweet
Sockings hung with joy complete
Feeling closer to heaven, every little name
All I see is love in every sway tonight
The magic of this time makes everything feel right
Yes, it's warmth in that gentle glow outside
Christmas Eve will cherish every sight
In a minor soft embrace
Every twinkle shows his grace
Let's hold this warmth in space
We'll keep the spirit in our hearts away
Though I see his love in every slate tonight
The magic of this time makes everything feel right
It's his fourth in that gentle glow outside
Christmas Eve will cherish every sight
