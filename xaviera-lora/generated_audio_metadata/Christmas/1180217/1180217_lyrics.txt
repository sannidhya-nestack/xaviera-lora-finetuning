Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angels sing
Oh knowledge
When Christ was born
O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
O hear the angel voices, O night divine, O night when Christ was born, O night divine, O night divine, O night divine, O night divine, O night divine, O night divine, O night divine, O night divine, O night divine, O night divine, O night divine, O night divine, O night divine, O night divine, O night divine, O night divine, O night divine, O night divine, When Christ was born (Christ was born)
Divine, oh night, oh night divine
Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall he break, for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name
Christ
Christ is the Lord
Let ever, ever praise we know
Noel
O night (holy night) when Christ was born (Christ was born)
Noel (Noel) Noel
O night
A holy night
