Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob tails ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upside, oh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
A day or two ago, the story I must tell
I went out in the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by, in one horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as I there lay, but quickly drove away
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
So now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this slaying song
Just bet a barbed-tailed bay
240 at his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack, you'll take the lead
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
