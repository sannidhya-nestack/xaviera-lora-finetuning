Snowflakes fall, a gentle breeze
Wrapped in blankets, feeling ease
By the fire, our shadows play
Whispering love on Christmas day
In the glow of twinkling lights
Hearts find peace on winter nights
Cozy Christmas moments, you and me
Wrapped in warmth so tenderly
In this season love will bloom
Underneath this silver moon
Carol sung in harmony
Holding you so close to me
This old Torah hangs overhead
Sharing dreams and words unsaid
In the glow of twinkling lights
Hearts find peace on winter nights
Cozy Christmas moments you and me
Wrapped in warmth so tenderly
In this season love will bloom
Underneath the silver moon
Carol sung in harmony
Holding you so close to me
Mistletoe hangs overhead
Sharing dreams and words unsaid
In the glow of twinkling lights
Hearts find peace on winter nights
Cozy Christmas moments you and me
Wrapped in warmth so tenderly
In this season, love will bloom
Underneath the silver moon
Stars above, they guide our way
Through the night and into day
In your eyes, I see the light
Christmas love, so pure and bright
Cozy Christmas moments, you and me
Wrapped in warmth so tenderly
In this season, love will bloom
Underneath the silver moon
