Santa's got his boots on tight
Dancing through the snow so bright
His sleigh is swinging left and right
Christmas joy is taking flight
Reindeer tapping out the beat
Hooves are flying oh so fleet
Down the chimney ain't that neat
Bringing presents can't be beat
Jingle bells oh what a sight
With him in the silent night
Santa's swinging to the light
Making everything alright
Elves are surrounding in the shop
Toy guitars that never stop
Music makes their hearts just pop
Candy canes and lollipops
He's the king of Christmas time
With a jazz that's so sublime
Every note's like sparkling wine
Santa's groove, oh so fine
Jingle bells, oh what a sight
Rhythm in the silent night
Santa swinging to the light
Making everything alright
Elves are strumming in the shop
Toy guitars that never stop
Music makes their hearts just pop
Candy canes and lollipops
He's the king of Christmas time
With a jazz that's so sublime
Every note's like sparkling wine
Santa's groove oh so fine
Jingle bells oh what a sight
Rhythm in the silent night
Santa swinging'til the light
Making everything alright
