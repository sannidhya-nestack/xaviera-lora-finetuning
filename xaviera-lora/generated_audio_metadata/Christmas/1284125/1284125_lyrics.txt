Santa's got the whip, no reindeer, run away
Cruisin' through the night, holiday vibes in a way
Night full of toys, no parole parole
L's on the payroll, donuts in a bowl
Jimmy Dice movies won't leave no debris
Cookies on the table, milk by the tree
Midnight snack attack, slate bells chime
Santa's got the swagger, jolly prime time
Sleigh bells ringing, Santa on the track
Gifts stacking high, never looking back
Ho ho ho, hear the laughter in the night
Bringing cheer to all, under holiday light
Red suit clips drip colder than ice
Snowflakes fallin', holly lookin' nice
Rudolph in the lead, headlights beam
Peppermint on the air, fantasy scene
Santa's playlist, old school bangs
Jingle jams roll, while the sleigh swangs
Mistletoe magic, love in the glows
Waking at miss Claus, she already knows
Sleigh bells ringing, Santa on the track
Gifts snacking high, never looking back
Ho ho ho, hear the laughter in the night
Bringing cheer to all, under holiday light
Red suit crisp drip colder than ice
Gift stacking high never looking back
Ho ho ho hear the laughter in the night
Bring a cheer to all under holiday light
