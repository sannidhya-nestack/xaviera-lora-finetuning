Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Wrong young virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
In heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glory streaming from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing an Hallelujah
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
