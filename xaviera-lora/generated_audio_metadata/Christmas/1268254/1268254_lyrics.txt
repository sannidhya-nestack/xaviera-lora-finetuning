The snow is falling softly
The lights are shining bright
Every note of joy reminds me
Of you holding me tight
With every carol sung
I hear your voice in the sound
Christmas melodies fill my heart when you're around
Oh, the magic of the season
It all feels so true
But the greatest gift I've given
It's the love I feel from you
In the warmth of your embrace I found
Christmas melodies
Through my heart with you around
With you around, around
By the fire we are swaying
To the songs of the night
You and me, our love, love glowing
Everything feels so right
A deep bell that rings
A harmony profound
Christmas melodies fill my heart when you're around
Oh, the magic of the season, it all feels so true
With the greatest gift I'll give you
With the love I feel from you
And the warmth of your embrace
I felt that Christmas melody
From my heart with you around
With you around
Oh, through the snow and the cheer
Oh, won't you ever kneel with you beside me
Every Christmas feels new
All the songs we share, the love in the air
And my heart sings only for you, for you
Oh, the magic of the season (of the season)
It all feels so true (so true)
But the greatest gift of (gift of)
Is your love I give for you (you give for you)
I won't let your hand break my heart
Christmas melody
Fill my heart with you, oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh
