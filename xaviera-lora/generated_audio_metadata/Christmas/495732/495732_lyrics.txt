O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appears
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel
O come, thou wisdom from on high
Who orderest all things mightily
To us the path of knowledge show
And teach us in her ways to go
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Rejoice, rejoice
O come, thou Key of David, come
And open wide our heavenly home
Make safe the way that leads on high
And close the path to misery
Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Shall come to thee
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Israel, Israel
