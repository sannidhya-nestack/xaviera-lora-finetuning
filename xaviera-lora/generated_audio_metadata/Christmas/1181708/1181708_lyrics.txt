Christmas is here, there's holiday cheer
And presents beneath the tree
There's all kinds of gifts from a Christmas list
But one gift remains
The greatest gift that you'll receive is the gift from God within John 3 :16
It's not just for you
It's not just for me
A gift that is meant for one and all
It's the good news at Christmas
When He gave us Jesus
And as one of us
He reached the heart and soul of everyone
For God so loved the world He gave His Son
Heaven is a perfect place
But we're not free from false
He paid the price to let us in
When He died on the cross
He won the war of sin for good
His gift to you and me
Became a living sacrifice
Love in the first degree
We needed a Savior, so He gave us favor
And offered to us His only Son
When He came to die, showed us what God is like
And gave us the glory of His love
His steadfast love toward us
A reminder of his greatest gift
He showed us this, his perfect gift
God's great Christmas gift
Born from his love
