Wake up to a winter scene, snowflakes in the air
Lights are twinkling red and green, joy is everywhere
Stockings hanging by the fire, kiss beneath the tree
Every day a holiday, a jolly jubilee
Wake up to a winter scene, snowflakes in the air
Lights are twinkling, red and green, joy is everywhere
Stockings hanging by the fire, gifts beneath the tree
Every day a holiday, a jolly jubilee
Candy canes and cookie dough
Fresh out of the oven
Laughter ringing through the halls
Hearts so full of lovin'
Bells are packing Santa's sleigh
He's flying through the sky
Reindeer dancing on the roof
Rudolph's nose is nigh
Fa la la la la
Let's cheer on night and day
With sleigh bells ringing
We'll shout Hip Hoo-ay
Fa-la-la-la-la-la, let's make it extra bright
Every moment Christmas, let's light up the night
Gingerbread and mistletoe, cozy by the fire
Sipping cocoa by the glow, warmth we all aspire
Singing carols door to door, spreading faster cheer
Wishing it was Christmas every day of the year
Nordic nights a glistening snowman in the yard
Peace and love come easily when life gets kinda hard
Magic fills the winter breeze, hearts are feeling light
Look around, it's Christmas joy, glowing oh so bright
Fa la la la la, let's cheer all night and day
Whistling bells ringing, we'll shout hip hooray
Fa-la-la-la-la-la, let's make it extra bright
Every moment Christmas, let's light up the night
