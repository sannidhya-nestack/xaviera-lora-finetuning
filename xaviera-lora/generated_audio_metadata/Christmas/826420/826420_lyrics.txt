Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells
All seem to say, throw cares away
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer
To young and old, meek and the bold
Merry merry merry merry Christmas
Merry merry merry merry Christmas
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
That is their song with joyful ring, all caroling
One seems to hear words of good cheer from everywhere
Filling the air, oh how they pound, raising the sound
Oh hear them down, telling their tale
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of the cheer
Christmas is here
Merry merry merry merry Christmas
Merry merry merry merry Christmas
Merry merry merry merry Christmas
Merry merry merry merry Christmas
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
