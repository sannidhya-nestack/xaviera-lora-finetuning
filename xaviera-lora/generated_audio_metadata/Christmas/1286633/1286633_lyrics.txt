The sunrise on a snowy street
Candy canes and amber leafy
Rapping joy in boxes neat
Echoes of a heartbeat
Twinkling lights and mistletoe
Sleigh bells ringing silent snow
Whispers in the frosty glow
Magic in the air we tow
New day on Christmas morning
Hearts are brightly soaring
Laughter's in the snowflakes
Memories whiskering
Children's eyes are glowing with glee
Beneath the sparkling tree
Hopes and dreams set free
Moments pure and carefree
Warmth in every heart we share
Love's presence everywhere
Gift wrapped with tender care care
Joy beyond compare
New day on Christmas morning
Hearts are brightly soaring
Laughter's in the snowflakes
Memories whizz calling
Children's eyes are glow with glee
Beneath the sparkling tree
Hope's entry set free
Moments pure and carefree
Warmth in every hug we share
Love's presence everywhere
Gift wrapped with tender care
Joy beyond compare
New day on Christmas morning
Hearts are brightly soaring (brightly soaring)
Blaskets in the snowflakes (snowflakes)
Memories withering
