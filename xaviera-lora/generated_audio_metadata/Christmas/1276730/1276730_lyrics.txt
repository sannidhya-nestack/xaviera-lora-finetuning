Snow falls gently on the ground
Evergreens in silence found
Lights that shimmer in the night
Turning dark to pure delight
In the stillness hear the cheer
Christmas time is drawing near
Evergreen dreams soft and bright
Filling hearts with pure delight
In this magic love will gleam
Sharing joy in evergreen dreams
Voices sing a carol sweet
Families gather hearts to meet
Warmth of love a tender glow
In the winter's gentle flow
In the stillness hear the cheer
Christmas time's drawing near
Evergreen dreams soft and bright
Filling hearts with pure delight
In this magic love will gleam
Sharing joy in evergreen dreams
Voices sing a carol sweet
Families gather, hearts to meet
Warmth of love, a tender glow
In the winter's gentle flow
In the stillness, hear the cheer
Christmas time's drawing near
Evergreen dreams soft and bright
Filling hearts with pure delight
In this magic love will gleam
Sharing joy in evergreen dreams
Stars above they shine so clear
Guiding us to those we hold dear
In the quiet dreams take flight
Found my love on Christmas night
Evergreen dreams soft and bright
Filling hearts with pure delight
In this magic love will gleam
Sharing joy in evergreen dreams
Sharing joy in evergreen dreams
