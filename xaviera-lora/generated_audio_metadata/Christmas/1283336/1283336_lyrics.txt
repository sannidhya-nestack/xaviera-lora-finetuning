Jingle bells, jazzin' on the street
Santa's got swingin' his feet
Snowflakes fallin', can't be beat
Heart, let the rhythm feel the heat
Text the halls with feet so fine
Electric lights a-blowin' time
Ornaments that really shine
Swingin' Christmas, that's divine
Nutcrackers dancing'round the tree
Candy canes for you and me
Starlight nights as bright as can be
Melodies of mirth and glee
Text the halls with beats so fine
Electric lights that glow and shine
Ornaments that really shine
Swinging Christmas stops divine
From rooftops hear the carolers sing
Reindeer hoof beats and the last game ring
Hot cocoa sip and let it sing
St. Nick sleigh bells in full swing
The balls with beats so fine
Electric lights that glow and shine
Ornaments that really shine
Swinging Christmas staff divine
