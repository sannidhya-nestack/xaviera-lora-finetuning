Snow flakes are wetzing down the street Underneath the city's twinkling beat
The scent of cocoa fills the air Lovers pause at the corner cafe stare
Wreaths and ribbons on every door
Carolers singing like never before
A wink from Santa passing by
Neon lights reflecting kids wide eyes
Join a mistletoe mumbo it's the seasons delight
Wrap your arms around the joy of the night
Twirl with cheer beneath the starry glow
Let the magic of December flow
Jingle bells in the distance play
Skaters gliding in a festive ballet
Candles flicker on the windowsill
Echoing warmth of the winter chill
Oh, the city's alive with holiday bliss
Moments like these are too precious to miss
Greet each stranger with a warm embrace
A smile is the gift you can't misplace
Silver tinsel on the Christmas tree
Glistening like laughter wild and free
Stockings hung by the chimney's flame
Hoping for presents that bear our name
Join the mistletoe, mambo
It's the season's delight
Wrap your arms around the joy of the night
Pull the chair beneath the starry glow
Let the magic of December flow
Oh
