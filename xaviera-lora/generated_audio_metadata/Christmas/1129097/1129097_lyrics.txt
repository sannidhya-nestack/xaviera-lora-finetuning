It's almost too much to believe
That I'd drop by on Christmas Eve
And find you here, I was so sure
You wouldn't be at home
Probably nothing for me
And Santa's sleigh
But this must be my lucky day
No one should spend Christmas Eve alone
I should have called ahead, but hey
I didn't know just what to say
I thought I'd leave a note or something
To wish you Christmas cheer
I know it's been so
Many years I wasn't sure he still lived here
No one should spend Christmas Eve alone
I know no one lives without regret
But you're the one I can't et
Ain't met another like you yet
And I probably never will
Yet here we are, this could be fate
My heart says it's not too late
I truly feel that love might pay the bill
So let's talk a while, we'll take it slow
Just in case I brought some mistletoe
I can take it from my pocket
If you're feeling so inclined
You know I'm not the optimistic kind
But I've got romance on my mind
No one should spend Christmas Eve alone
No one should spend Christmas Eve alone
