When school let out in December
We got to play every day in the snow
We make snowman L's at Santa's village
Pretend it was the North Pole
I'd put on my Santa hat
You wore an apron at your play stove
I'd say, "Ho, ho, ho"
You'd laugh and smile at me
Then we'd kiss under the mistletoe
I'd be your Santa and you'd be my Mrs. Claus
We'd use my new red wagon to be our slave
My dog Rover was a reindeer
With his big ole furry paws
We'd bring gifts to all our friends on Christmas day
We both were sad when we found out you had to move away
Rover and I were lonely every single day
In December I'd still wear my Santa hat
But I missed you by my side
Wishing you'd come back and someday be my bride
I was still your Santa but I missed my Mrs. Claus
Every year my wagon got smaller as my sleigh
Rover was still my reindeer with his big old furry paws
All I wanted was to be with you on Christmas day
One December when we'd both grown up my wishes finally came true
I looked up and standing there was you
You were prettier than ever
I wanted to kiss you but you said no
You said we got to wait till we're under the mistletoe
I knew that I was in love with you
So I got down on one knee
Ask for your hand in marriage right there under the Christmas tree
I said, I'll be your Santa if you'll be my Mrs. Claus
I got a new red truck just waiting to be our sleigh
Old Rover these days rides shotgun
Curled up on his furry paws
Let's get married on Christmas day
And you said if you'll be my Santa
I'd love to be your Mrs. Claus
We'll use your new red truck to be our sleigh
Rover can ride between us
Curled up on his big old paws
Let's get married on Christmas day
