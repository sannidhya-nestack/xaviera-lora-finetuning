Snowflakes are falling, lights are aglow
Christmas time, our hearts start to show
Makes me treat you the way that I do
Oh baby, ain't I good to you?
There's nothing in this world too fine
For a love like yours and mine
I got you a fur coat for Christmas
A little diamond ring, way in lowly fame
Hot cocoa fire lights wrapped up tight
Sleigh bells ring softly through the night
Makes me treat you the way that I do
Baby, ain't I good to you?
I got you a firm move for Christmas
A little diamond ring
We ain't going ahead
What makes me cherish you
Through these festive nights
Hey baby, good to you
Thunder twinkling lights
I got you a fur coat for Christmas
A little diamond ring
We ain't gonna fade
