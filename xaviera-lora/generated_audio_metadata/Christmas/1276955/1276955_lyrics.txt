Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Bells are ringing clear and bright
City glowing feeling right
Jingle, jingle all night long
Streets are packed the lights are go
Everyone dancing here we go
Tinsel shimmering in the light
Santa's coming hold on tight
Jingle, jingle, jingle, yeah
Dance until the morning light
Feel the magic in the air
Jingle, jingle all night long
Children laughing, happy faces
Gifts and hugs, warm embraces
Holiday spirit everywhere
Ooh, your hands can shake, it's show you care
Jingo
All night long
Streets all packed, lights a glow
Everyone dancing, here we go
Tinsel shimmering in the light
Santa's coming home that night
Streets all packed, lights a glow
Everyone dancing, here we go
Tinsel shimmering in the light
Jingle all night long
Jingle, jingle, jingle, yeah
Dance until the morning light
Feel the magic in the air
Jingle, jingle, oh
All night long
Jingle, jingle, yeah
Jingle, dance until the morning light
Feel the magic in the air
Jingle, jingle, all night long
