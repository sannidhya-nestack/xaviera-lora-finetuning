Snowflakes falling from the sky
Shimmering lights they never lie
In the cold night we feel the cheer
Wishing upon a star so near
Children's laughter fills the air
Gifts under trees everywhere
Sparkling nights that warm the heart
Together though we're miles apart
Wish upon a Christmas star
Wherever you are near or far
Dreams come true under this light
Magic in the silent night
Candles flicker warm and bright
Joy and love in starry heights
Hopes we hold tight in our hands
Wishing on stars through many lands
Saturdays gather round to sing
Memories that the season brings
Heartfelt smiles and happy tears
Wish upon a star this year
Wish upon a Christmas star
Wherever you are near or far
Dreams come true under this light
Magic in the silent night
Candles flicker warm and bright
