O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul found its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morning
O hear the angel voices! O night divine! O night when Christ was born! O night, O night divine!
O night divine
O holy night
By the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of faith
The stars sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings laid thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night, O holy night, O night divine, O night, O holy night, O night divine.
