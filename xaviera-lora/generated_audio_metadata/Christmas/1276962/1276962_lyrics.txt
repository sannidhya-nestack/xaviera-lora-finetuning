Sparkling snowflakes cure delay
Dancing in the soft moonlight
Viewing by a winter's tale
Love's embrace we will prevail
In the silence hear this song
Christmas whispers all night long
Sparkling snowflakes hearts ignite
Warming souls in coldest night
In the season love will grow
Shine and cry like falling snow
Footprints in the frosty glade
Moments that will never fade
Holding close we share our dreams
Lost in love's enchanting beams
In the silence hear this song
Christmas whispers all night long
In the silence hear this song
Christmas whispers all night long
Sparkling snowflakes hearts ignite
Warming souls in coldest night
In this season love will grow
Shining bright like fallen snow
Footprints in the frosty clay
Moments that will never fade
Holding close we share our dreams
Lost in love's enchanting themes
In the silence hear the song
Christmas whispers all night long
Stars above they softly gleam
Guiding us through this sweet dream
In your eyes a world of light
Christmas love forever bright
Sparkling snowflakes hearts ignite
Warming souls in coldest night
In this season love will grow
Shining bright like fallen snow
