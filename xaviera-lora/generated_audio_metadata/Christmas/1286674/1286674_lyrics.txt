Twinkly lights and silent nights
Whispers of frost on window panes
Stars align in calming light
Peaceful echoes fill the lanes
Snowflakes dance on moonlit ground
Candles glow in quiet grace
Voices soft with harmony found
In this still and gentle space
Joy to the stars above
Silent blessings we're dreaming of
Magic woven in our hearts
As the world in wonder starts
Joy to the stars above
Silent blessings we're dreaming of
Magic woven in our hearts
Has the world in wonder scars
Crystal skies and frosty air
Glistening trees and love to share
Ancient carols softly play
In this night where dreams are made
Gifts of time and simple things
Warm embrace and what it brings
Moments shared with those we love
Underneath the stars above
Joy to the stars above
Silent blessings we're dreaming of
Magic woven in our hearts
As the world in wonder starts
Torn of the silence of birth
Sign of blessings we're dreaming of
Magic woven in our hearts
As the world in wonder starts
