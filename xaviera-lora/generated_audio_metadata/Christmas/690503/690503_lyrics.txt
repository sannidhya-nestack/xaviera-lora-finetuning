Angels we have heard on high (Angels we have heard on high)
Sweetly singing o'er the plains (Sweetly singing o'er the plains)
And the mountains in reply (And the mountains in reply)
Echoing their joyous strains
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Shepherds, why this Jubilee? (Angels we have heard on high)
Why your joyous strains prolong? (Angels we have heard on high)
What the gladsome tidings be? (Angels we have heard on high)
Which inspire your heavenly song
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Come to Bethlehem and see Him whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee Christ the Lord, the newborn King
Lord
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
See Him in a manger laid (In excelsis Deo)
Whom the angels praise above (In excelsis Deo)
Mary Joseph, lend your aid (In excelsis Deo)
While we raise our hearts in love (In excelsis Deo)
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
In excelsis Deo
In excelsis Deo
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
