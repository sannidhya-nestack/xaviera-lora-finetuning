Little Jesus, sweetly sleep, do not stir
We will lend a coat of fur
We will rock you, rock you, rock you
We will rock you, rock you, rock you
See the fur to keep you warm
Snuggling round your tiny form
Mary's little baby sleep, sweetly sleep
Sleep in comfort slumber deep
We will rock you, rock you, rock you
We will rock you, rock you, rock you
We will serve you all we can
Darling, darling little man
Methinks I see a heavenly host of angels on the wing
Methinks I hear their cheerful notes so merrily they sing
So merrily they sing
Let all your fears be banished hence the tidings I proclaim
For there's a Savior born today and Jesus is His name
And Jesus is His name
Lay down your clubs and quip your flocks to Bethlehem repair
And let your wandering steps be squared by yonder shining star
By yonder shining star
Seek not in courts or palaces, nor royal courts in store
But search the stable sea of God, extend it on the straw
Extend it on the straw
It's certainly a heavenly host around the shepherd's throne
Exulting in the threefold God and thus address his song
And thus address his song
To God the Father, Christ the Son, and Holy Ghost adore
The first and last, the last and first, eternal praise afford
Eternal praise afford
