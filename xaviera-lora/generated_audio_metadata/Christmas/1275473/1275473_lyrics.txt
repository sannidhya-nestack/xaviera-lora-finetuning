Starlit sky on Christmas Eve
Magic that we all believe
Snowflakes shimmer, softly fall
Casting wonder over all in the
Stillness haunts our light
Christmas makes the world so bright
Starlit Christmas night we sing
Feel the joy this season brings
In the glow of candlelight
Celebrate this holy night
Families gather, stories told
Treasures worth much more than gold
Carols sung by fires blow
Warming hearts in winter show
In the stillness, hearts are alive
Christmas makes the world so bright
Silent Christmas night, we sing
Feel the joy this season brings
In the glow of candlelight
Celebrate this holy night
Through the years these moments last
Memories of Christmas past
Hand in hand we find our way
In the light of Christmas day
Starlit Christmas night we sing
Feel the joy this season brings
In the glow of candlelight
Celebrate this holy night
Evergreens adorned with light
Shining through the silent night
In this peace we come together
Holding on to Christmas forever
Family years, these moments last
Memories of Christmas past
Hand in hand, we find our way
Warming hearts in winter show
In the years, these moments last
Memories of Christmas past
Hand in hand, we find our way
In the light of Christmas day
Through the years these moments last
Memories of Christmas past
Hand in hand we find our way
In the light of Christmas day
Through the years these moments last
Memories of Christmas past
Hand in hand we find our way
In the light of Christmas day
Evergreens adorned with light
Shining through the silent night
In this peace we come together
Holding on to Christmas forever
