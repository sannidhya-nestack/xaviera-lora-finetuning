Long ago, under a star that burned bright in the eastern sky
A baby boy was born to a special girl
Angels sang, shepherds came but she couldn't understand
What this little boy would really mean
Remember, don't ever et what this season is really about
Jesus Christ, Son of God was born
He was the greatest gift the world would ever receive
Salvation for all
Who believed
He grew up to be a man who lived God's word every day
Made the lame to walk the blind to see
Then He gave His life upon a cross to set us free
Now we can know exactly what He means
Remember, don't ever et what this season is really about
Jesus Christ, Son of God was born
He was the greatest gift the world would ever receive
Salvation for all who believe
This time of year, oh
I get my joy from the birth of that baby boy
Remember, don't ever et what this season is really about
Jesus Christ, Son of God was born
He was the greatest gift the world would ever receive
Salvation for all who believe
Salvation
For all who believe
