O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appears
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
O come, thou Key of David, come
And open wide our heavenly home
Make safe the way that leads on high
And close the path to misery
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
O come, O come, thou Lord of might
We to your tribes on Sinai's height
In ancient times did give the law
In cloud and majesty and awe
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel!
