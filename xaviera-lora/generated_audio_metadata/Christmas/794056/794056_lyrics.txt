I called everyone, they said they would come
And we all agreed we need you here on Christmas day
it's been way too long since you read the Christmas story
With the family gathered'round, so what do you say?
Make this our best Christmas
The best we've had in years
Promise us you'll be here
And you'll make this our best Christmas
The children wrote your name on a stocking that they made
And underneath the tree there'll be a present just for you
We'll even let you have an extra piece of pie
If you'll lead us in a Christmas carol or two
Make this our best Christmas
The best we've had in years
Promise us you'll be here
And you'll make this our best Christmas
When Christmas dinner's over
And the children are tucked in
We can make our plans
For sharing Christmases to come
Promise us you'll be here
And you'll make this our best Christmas
Oh, you'll make this our best Christmas
