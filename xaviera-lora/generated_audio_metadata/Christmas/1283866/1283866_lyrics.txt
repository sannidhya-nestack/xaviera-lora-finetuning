Cavity canes and ditches of a tunnel
Stuck in a tunnel and fires aglow
Owls are busy working fast
You'll tie cheer that's sure to last
Baking cookies by the fire
Spreading joy and never tire
Stringing lights around the tree
Magic here for all to see
Sleigh ho, sleigh ho, let's go
To the North Pole in the snow
Santa's elves are on a roll
Preparing for the old tide show
Tiny hammers, tink and nook
Building toys around the clock
Glue and glitter fill the air
Santa's sack with gifts to share
Reindeer passing in the yard
Hooves that land and never scarred
Song and laughter everywhere
Love and joy beyond compare
Sleigh ho, sleigh ho, let's go
To the North Pole in the snow
Santa's elves are on a roll
Preparing for the old tide show
Tide show
Tide show
Tired show, tired show, tired show
