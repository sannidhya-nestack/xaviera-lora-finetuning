Snowy paths, the moonlit days
In your eyes, a sweet romance
Wrapped in scarves, we brave the cold
Sharing secrets, dreams untold
In the hush of winter's night
Loving nights in soft moonlight
Holiday heartbeat, close and true
Every moment, me and you
In this magic love will grow
Underneath the mistletoe
Cocoa by the fireside
Warmth within, no need to hide
Gentle whispers, soft and clear
Christmas love, you're always near
In the hush of winter's night
Loving nights in soft moonlight
Loving nights in soft moonlight
Holiday heartbeat, close and true
Every moment, me and you
In this magic, love will grow
Underneath the mistletoe
Cocoa by the fireside
Warmth within no need to hide
Gentle whisper soft and clear
Christmas love you're always near
In the hush of winter's night
Loving nights in soft moonlight
Loving nights in soft moonlight
Holiday heartbeat close and true
Every moment me and you
In this magic love will grow
Underneath the mistletoe
Stars above, they shine so bright
Guiding us through this night
In your arms I feel the glow
Christmas love I'll always know
Holiday heart beat close and true
Every moment me and you
In this magic love will grow
Underneath the mistletoe
