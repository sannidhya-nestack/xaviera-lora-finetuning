Baby you know it's that time of year
But this Christmas is wrapped in fear
I'm hanging up my stockings six feet apart
Not hugging my Grammy breaks my heart
Cause it's a COVID quarantine Christmas
Cause it's a COVID quarantine Christmas
Get off my wish list for the gov
And sanitize a mess and some rubber gloves
And et the number one on the list
Toilet paper selling off the shelves
The elf getting pissed
it's a COVID quarantine Christmas
it's a COVID quarantine Christmas
Doing family dinners this year on Zoom
I wonder if they'll notice that I left the room
I'm rescheduling my life for two years
Now every Christmas movie brings me to tears
Cause it's a COVID quarantine Christmas
Cause it's a COVID quarantine Christmas
It's a COVID quarantine Christmas (COVID Christmas)
Yeah, it's a COVID quarantine Christmas
COVID
You're messing my plans
COVID
I'm just not a fan
COVID
On the news everyday
COVID
Can you just go away?
COVID
It's such a crime
Santa's replaced with Amazon Prime
Cooper and Lemon, Cuomo and Blitzer
No Dasher or Dancer, no Rudolph or Blitzen
No Blitzen
Baby, you know it's that time of year
But this Christmas hasn't lost its cheer
I'm sitting on my present six feet apart
Not sitting on Santa's lap breaks his heart
'Cause it's a COVID quarantine Christmas
it's a COVID quarantine Christmas
It's a COVID quarantine Christmas
Yeah, it's a COVID quarantine Christmas
Maybe it's COVID outside
Fauci's on time
Sanitizer's going to town (It's a Covid quarantine Christmas)
I guess you won't be seeing mommy kissing Santa Claus (It's a Covid quarantine Christmas)
Boys will not see (It's a Covid quarantine Christmas)
Yeah, it's a Covid quarantine Christmas (It's a Covid quarantine Christmas)
it's a Covid quarantine Christmas (It's a Covid quarantine Christmas)
it's a Covid quarantine Christmas
Albert! What?
I buried Paul
