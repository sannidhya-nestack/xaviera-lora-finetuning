The snow is falling, popping like corn
Lights a twinkle where magic is born
Chillin' by the chimney, heart keeps me warm
This festive fever's got me in a storm
Stacks of presents wrapped up in a red bow
Underneath the mistletoe lights with a glow
Giggling through the night, vibes that we show
Sharing, cheering like a movie in slow-mo
Dancing with the candy cane, swinging to the beat
Jingle bells tapping, I can't feel my feet
Reindeer's flying, yeah they're bringing that heat
The holiday spirit, man it can't be beat
Sipping cocoa with marshmallow delight
Stocking tongue tight by the fire light
Friends are laughing with such a sight
Feeling so alive under the starry night
Green sign hanging every door we pass
Joyful melodies that fill the class
Catching snowflakes they don't need a pass
Holiday vibes straight from the looking glass
So with the candy cane swinging to the beat
Jingle bells tapping I can feel my feet
Rainbeams flying after bringing that heat
The holiday spirit man it can't be beat
Dancing with the candy cane swinging to the beat
Jingle bells tapping I can't feel my feet
Reindeer's flying if they're bringing that heat
The holiday spirit man it can't be beat
Dancing with the candy cane swinging to the beat
Jingle bells tapping I can't feel my feet
Uh, reindeers flying, you have to bring in that heat
The holiday spirit, man, it can't be beat
Beat, beat, beat, beat
So with the candy cane swinging to the beat
Jingle bells tapping, I can't feel my feet
Reindeers flying, you have to bring in that heat
The holiday spirit, man, it can't be heat
It can't be beat
