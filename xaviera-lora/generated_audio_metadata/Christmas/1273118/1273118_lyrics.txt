Lights are twinkling on the tree
Joyful songs in harmony
Families gather, hearts aglow
Love and warmth in every show
Feel the magic in the air
Christmas spirit everywhere
Twinkle in the snow tonight
Hearts are shining oh so bright
Hold me close
Don't let go
In this wonderland of snow
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Gifts are wrapped with tender care
Memories we'll always share
Laughter echoes through the halls
Magic moments as snow falls
Feel the magic in the air
Christmas spirit everywhere
Twinkle in the snow tonight
Hearts are shining oh so bright
Hold me close, don't let go
In this wonderland of snow
Underneath the mistletoe
Love's embrace, let it show
In this season, dreams come true
Every wish starts with you
Twinkle in the snow tonight
Hearts are shining oh so bright
Hold me close
Don't let go
In this wonderland of snow
