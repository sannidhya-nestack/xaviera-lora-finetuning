We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star
Born a king on Bethlehem's plain
Gold I bring to crown him again
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign
Star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Guide us to thy perfect light
We three kings of orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Prayer and praising, all men raising
Worship him God on high
Glorious now, behold Him arise
King and God and sacrifice
Alleluia, alleluia
Sounds through the earth and sky
Star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still full seating
Guide us to thy perfect light
Guide us to thy perfect light
Guide us to thy perfect light
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
