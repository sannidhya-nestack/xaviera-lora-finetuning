Snowflakes fall at the reindeer glide
Santa's sleeping with a sack to hide
Little kids with dreams so grand
Wonder if he has his own land
Does he wish for peace
Or maybe a pie or a vacation under a sunny sky
A sleigh upgrade with bells that chime
Or a night off sipping warm old wine
Send us wishes who can truly know
Beneath the beard and the ho-ho-ho
Maybe a gift that's sparkle so bright
Or simply love on a silent night
Maybe he dreams of snowball fights
Or cozy evenings by Christmas lights
A conversation with an old friend
Or letters from kids that never end
Jolly old elf with a secret stash
Dark roots clicking on the snowy path
What could he ask for at Yuletide?
Maybe a chance to hitch a ride
Send us wishes who can truly know
Beneath the fear and the hope
Maybe a gift that sparkles so bright
Or simply love on a silent night
Does he wish for peace or maybe a pie
Or a vacation under a sunny sky
A sleigh, a crate with bells that chime
Or a night off sipping warm old wine
Send us wishes who can truly know
Beneath the spirit and the ho-ho-ho
Maybe a gift that sparkles so bright
Or simply love on a silent night
Tell the old elf with the secret stash
Dark roots clicking on the snowy path
What could he ask for at Yuletide?
Maybe a chance to hitch a ride
Send us wishes who can truly know
Beneath the beard and the ho-ho-ho
Maybe a gift that sparkles so bright
Or simply a love on a silent night
