I know you're working late, but babe I need a date to this merry Christmas party
I know right where you're at, too cool for Santa hats
But I like you, I'm not sorry
But I figured out, it's time to stand and shout
Don't you know that it's Christmas
Don't you know that it's time to spread some joy
Don't you know that it's Christmas
Happiness for every girl and boy
Don't you know that it's Christmas
It's Christmas
It's getting chilly out
But babe I really doubt that you'll find a better caller
So baby cross the line
And put your hand in mine
Christmas time don't be a baller
Happy Holiday
Time to shine and sing
Don't you know that it's Christmas
Don't you know that it's time to feel the joy
Don't you know that it's Christmas
Got a present for every girl and boy
Don't you know that it's Christmas?
It's Christmas!
I see you roll your eyes and try to turn and walk away
I just need you with a kiss to make my holiday
I feel it steady as I pull you up into the sleigh
You lean right in and we embrace the way, a bit cliche
There's no resisting love is in the air
And twinkle lights are all over me
Don't you know that it's Christmas?
Don't you know that it's time for trees to glow?
Don't you know that it's Christmas?
Time to go visit Santa, ho, ho, ho
Don't you know that it's Christmas?
Don't you know that it's time to spread some joy?
Don't you know that it's Christmas?
Happiness for every girl and boy
Don't you know that it's Christmas?
It's Christmas
Don't you know that it's Christmas
Yeah it's Christmas
Ho ho ho ho (ho ho ho)
It's Christmas, it's Christmas
Ho ho ho ho (ho ho)
It's Christmas, it's Christmas
