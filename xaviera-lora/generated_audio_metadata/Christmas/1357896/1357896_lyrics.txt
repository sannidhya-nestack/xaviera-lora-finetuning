Frost on the window, steam on the glass
Your gloves on the table, slow minutes pass
Brushed drums like snowfall, soft as a sigh
Vase taking small steps like folks passing by
Lean just a little, the city grows hushed
I taste orange and clove in the air as we brush
Let me keep time with the pulse of your hand
While the piano finds chords only we understand
Let the snow keep time while we sway
Under the glow of a holly lit day
Let it horn, whispers, the strings softly bloom
Silver notes drifting like lace through the room
Here in our corner
Where midnight turns kind
A Christmas in slow motion
Your cheek close to mine
Cups leave a crescent of warmth on the wood
Your laugh like a record that's crackling good
Sack draws a ribbon blue velvet and bright
And slate bells far off stitch pearls in the night
I've saved a few quiet words just for now
Tucked in my pocket like snow on a bough
If you'll let me I'll hum what I feel
Till the old year turns over and new lights reveal
Let the snow keep time while we sway
Under the glow of a holly-lit day
Scented horn whispers, the strings softly bloom
Silver notes drifting like lace through the room
Here in our corner
Where midnight turns kind
A Christmas in slow motion
Your cheek close to mine
I remember a postcard of trains in the dark
A candle and windows, a soft inking spark
Everything tinseled but nothing as true
As a low little lullaby dancing with you
The needle keeps circling, the world takes its cue
We'll treasure the hush that we're falling into
Let the snow keep time while we sway
Under the glow of a holly-lit day
Fitted horn whispers, the string softly blooms
Silver notes drifting like lace through the room
Here in our corner
The years fall in line
A Christmas in slow motion
Your cheek close to mine
Stay'til the morning draws light on the pain
Let the snow keep time and we'll sway once again
