Blue sky, dark blue surrounds her
One light, one star astounds her
Make room, they make a soft place
One sight, one sound is filled with grace
Eyes are wet with tears
Joyful for the sound she hears
A baby's crying
Cuts through the night, filling the sky
With a host of angel voices burning bright
In hearts of men hope began with a baby's cry
Hold him, she holds her baby close
One thought, one prayer each mother knows
Love but for all things
Lovely what the Christ child brings
A baby's cry
Cuts through the night, filling the sky
With a host of angel voices burning bright
In the hearts of men, hope began
With the babies crying
The light shines in the darkness
The dark has never put it out
She sings a lullaby in a stable
So very grateful for the sound
Of a baby's cry
A baby's cry
Cuts through the night
In the hearts of men
Hope began
With a baby's cry
