Snow writes its cursive on the window pane
Steam curls from cups with our names in the grain
Your wool scarf brushes my wrists like a bell
The trumpet in the corner whispers low somehow
December slows the clocks to candlelight
Your laugh rings silver through the night
Swing slow my dear, let the world fall still
In a warm calf where the cold can't fill
Well danced by the coat rack
Small and close, lay bells soft as secrets
Nobody knows if there's a standard we're meant to find
You're my evergreen rhyme, my favorite line
Sugar dissolves like a snowflake on the tongue
A needle finds its groove and the ears feel young
I draw little stars on the napkin by your hand
You tap the table softly like a gentle band
The city hums in velvet low and sweet
Our shadows sway where the lamplights mead
Swing slow my dear, let the world fall still
In a warm calf where the cold can't fill
We'll dance by the coat rack
Small and close, labels soft as secrets
Nobody knows if there's a standard we're meant to find
You're my evergreen, rhyme my fate
Outside the taxis wear snow like pearls
Inside your smile untangles the world
We take the long way home hand in glove
Let the past be your record
We'll play the B side of love swing slow
My dear, let the world fall still
In a warm calf where the cold can't fill
We'll dance by the coat rack
Small and close, lay bells soft as secrets
Nobody knows if there's a standard we're meant to find
You're my evergreen rhyme, my fate
Night drifts like ribbon through the closing door
Footprints sprayed the sidewalk to the corner store
Keep this hush for later when the winter winds begin
Every quiet note worth singing
I wanna sing again
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
