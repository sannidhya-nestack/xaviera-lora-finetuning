It's not a time or a place
But a feeling I cannot shake
I see white trees, sparkle tops
And red shiny pops
Hear footsteps at the door
Wind blowing, frost galore
Smells of ginger, chocolate and spice
Red ribbons flow through all those lights
Those are the days, memories of Christmas
Those are the days I recall
Those are my memories of Christmas
When will I see them again?
White flakes melting on my tongue
Nutmeg and sugar stirred into fun
I watch those paws jingle the bells
Young faces, open shiny bikes
Baby dolls, and train wreck
Those are the days, memories of Christmas
Those are the days I recall
Those are my memories of Christmas
When will I see them again?
Those are the days, memories of Christmas
Those are the days I recall
Those are my memories of Christmas
When will I see them again?
