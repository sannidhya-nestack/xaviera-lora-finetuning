Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Locks crackle low, fire burns slow
Wrapped up in your arms, I just let go
Lights on the tree, but you're my glow
December's never felt this warm before
Got cocoa in your hand, my heart in the other
Blanket round us tight, et the cold weather
Outside it's chill, but inside we're right
Love like this shines brighter than light
Smiling by the fire, looking at the stars
Christmas never felt so close to heart
Snow falls soft but we're still time stands still
And the world's ideal, baby with you it's all so bright
Under starry Christmas nights
Mistletoe weights but I already kissed ya
Silent night playing low in the picture
Frost on the windows, chill in the air
But I et it all when you're right there
Stockings hanging but I've gotten my prize
The way you look in that firelight
Let the world sleep, we're gonna stay
Watching stars while Christmas plays
Cuddlin' by the fire, lookin' at the stars
Christmas never felt so close to heart
Snow falls soft but we're still
Time stands still and the world's ideal
Baby with you it's all so bright
Under starry Christmas night
No gifts could match this peace of mind
Just your love and a little Christmas time
Heaven's near, I feel it now
Wish this night would last somehow
Cuddlin' by the fire, lookin' at the stars
Feels like heaven's right where we are
Snow falls soft, but baby we stay
Here in love'til the break of day
Forever starts when you hold me tight
On this starry Christmas night
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
