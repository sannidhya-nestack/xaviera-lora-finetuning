The first Noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in Fitz-Raz-Zay-Lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
They looked up and they saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
Hence you
The earth, it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King
King of Israel
Praises to the King of Israel
Praises to the God of Israel
Happy Birthday Jesus
And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far
To seek for a king was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
