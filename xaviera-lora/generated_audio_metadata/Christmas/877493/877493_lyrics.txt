Ooh yeah
Come on, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, yeah
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way, yeah
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
All right, yeah, dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh
Oh those fields we go
Laughing all the way, yeah
Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to write and sing
A slaying song tonight, oh yeah
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way, yeah
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey yeah
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way, all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, oh yeah
A day or two ago (day or two, day or two)
I thought I'd take a ride (take a ride, take a ride)
But soon Miss Fanny Bright (Fanny Bright, Fanny Bright)
Seated by my side (by my side, by my side)
The horse was lean and lank (jingle bells, jingle bells)
His fortune seemed his lot (jingle bells, jingle bells)
He got into a drifted bank
And we, we got upset
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way, yeah
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh, oh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse
One horse open sleigh
Jingle bells
