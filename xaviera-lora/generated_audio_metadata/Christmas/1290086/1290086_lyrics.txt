Snowflakes gently fall on a silent night
Wrapping up this gift, it feels so right
Fire cycle, oh, brings warmth to my soul
Underneath the mistletoe, I lose control
Your laughter echoes round the room, so sweet
Christmas magic in the air feels complete
Together we sing our favorite song
Hope you stay long, hope you stay long
Candles flicker, costume shadows that dance
Sharing this moment, a holiday bromance
The world outside is quiet, dressed in white
Inside with you, everything feels so right
Every present we open, a memory made
With every smile, darkness starts to fade
Seasons magic wrapped up tight
In your arms stars shine bright
No one's treasured within my heart
Forever and always, never to part
Hope you stay long, hope you stay long
With you here, I feel where I belong
Together we sing our favorite song
Hope you stay long, hope you stay long
