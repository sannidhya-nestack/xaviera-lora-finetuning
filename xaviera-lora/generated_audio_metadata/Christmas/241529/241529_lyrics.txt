The holy and the ivy, when they above the ground
O'er the trees that are in the wood, the holy bears the crown
O'er the rising of the sun and the running of the wind
O'er the wave of the river, sweet singing in the ground
The honeybees are blossom as white as any flower
And Mary goes sweet Jesus Christ to be our sweet Saviour
The Lord rides in our person and the Lamb in our body
And Mary goes in her home
Sweet singing in the dark night
The holly bears a belly as red as any
And Mary, O sweet Jesus Christ, true to God's sinner's door.
O the rising of the sun and the running of the deer,
And Mary, O Mary, sweet singing in the choir.
The holly bears a prickle, a shuffle's in the thorn
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ on Christmas day in the morn
All the night in our house all night long
Averdun, averdun, averdun
Sweet singing in the dark night
The holy vessel, darkest, bitter as any glow,
Ever and ever it pours sweet Jesus Christ, Lord, to redeem our souls.
All the rising of the sun and the running of the day,
All the morning of the Lord, sweetly sing.
Sweet singing in the wind
