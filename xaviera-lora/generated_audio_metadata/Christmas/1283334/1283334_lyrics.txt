Bells are ringing, stars are high, snowflakes falling from the sky
Gingerbread men in a row underneath the mistletoe
Stockings hanging with delight, gloves and scarves that keep us bright
Candy canes and peppermint, tinsel shining brilliance
It's a jingle jive extravaganza
Dancing with the snowmen flying around
Spinning round like Santa's sleigh
Magic in the air today
The ten soldiers march in a line
Hot cocoa by the fireside
Bells are rapping gifts of cheer
Wishing you a joyous year
It's a jingle-jive extravaganza
Dancing with the snowmen slide around
Spinning round like Santa's sleigh
Magic in the air today
Two yellow ghosts, two yellow guns
Ring their trumpets and their drums
Every note of your time's free
Join the festive symphony
Staple doom and sugar plums
Reindeer trumpets and big drums
Every note a yule tide spree
Join the festive symphony
