Santa is taking flight
How am I gonna sleep tonight
He's bringing lots of toys for the good girls and boys
And leaving them under the Christmas tree lights
The elves have been packing all day
The reindeer hitched up to the sleigh
In a lickety split it will come Saint Nick
I gotta get to sleep right away
I'll be tossin' and a-turnin', my mind will be a-churnin'
Over what he might bring for me
I hope my eyes are heavy'cause Santa's gettin' ready
To come down the chimney, yeah
Santa is takin' flight
How am I gonna sleep tonight?
No Christmas day surprise if I don't close my eyes
Better jump in bed and turn out the light
I'll be tossing and turning
My mind will be churning'bout what he might bring for me
I hope my eyes are heavy
Santa's getting ready
To come down my chimney
Down my chimney
Santa is taking flight
How am I gonna sleep tonight?
No Christmas day surprise
If I don't close my eyes
Better jump in bed and turn out the light
Santa is taking flight
How am I gonna sleep tonight
No Christmas day surprise if I don't close my eyes
Better jump in bed and turn out the light
No Christmas day surprise if I don't close my eyes
Better jump in bed and turn out the light
