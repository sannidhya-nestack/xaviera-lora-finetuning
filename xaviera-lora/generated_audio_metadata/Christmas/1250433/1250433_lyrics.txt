Outside snow is falling gently down
But there's warmth in the air all around
Santa sleigh is flying through the night
Delivering joy in the moonsoft light
Santa Claus is coming in the silent night
Bringing gifts and spreading Christmas delight
His laughter echoes in the stillness of the snow
Filling our hearts with a cheerful glow
Children tucked in bed dreaming with glee
Of the surprises Santa's bringing to see
His reindeer prance upon a rooftop so high
Guided by the sparkle in each child's eye
Santa Claus is coming in the silent night
Bringing gifts and spreading Christmas delight
His laughter echoes in the stillness of the snow
Filling our hearts with a cheerful glow
In the quiet of the night his presence is near
Bringing magic and wonder spreading cheer
The world is aglow with love and light
As Santa Claus visits in the silent night
Santa Claus is coming in the silent night
Bringing gifts and spreading Christmas delight
His laughter echoes in the stillness of the snow
Filling our hearts with a cheerful glow
So let's cherish this moment so pure and bright
Santa Claus is here in the silent night
May the spirit of Christmas forever ignite
In the joy and love that fills the night
