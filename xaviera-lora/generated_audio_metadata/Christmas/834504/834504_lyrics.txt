Days are growing short
Sweat and weather
I've been missing you this December
Twelve months flies by
I wonder where you are tonight
Fires are burning slow
Snow is falling
Watch the telephone
Thinking of calling
Where's the
Where'd time go? I will never know all I want
It's Christmas Eve
To be wrapped in your arms
Wrapped in your arms, oh
And fall into winter sleep
Watch movies by the tree
And be wrapped in your arms
Wrapped in your arms, oh
And fall into winter sleep
White little lights on the buildings
Make me think of you, you love the small things
Church bells ringing, choir singing
Pass a gentleman with his darling
See a payphone thinking of calling
Where's the phone?
Girl, oh baby please come home
'Til be wrapped in your arms, wrapped in your arms, oh
And fall into winter sleep
Watch movies by the tree
And be wrapped in your arms, wrapped in your arms oh
And fall into winter sleep
And fall into winter sleep, fall into winter sleep
Days are growing short, sweater weather
I've been missing you, this December
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh love
It's Christmas Eve
To be wrapped in your arms
Wrapped in your arms, oh
And fall into winter sleep
Watch movies by the tree
And be wrapped in your arms
Wrapped in your arms, oh
And fall into winter sleep
