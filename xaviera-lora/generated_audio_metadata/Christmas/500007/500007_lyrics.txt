Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Day or two ago I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank and we, we got upsot
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight and sing the slaying song
Just get up off town night 240 for his speed
Then hitch him to an open sleigh and crack he'll take the lead
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
