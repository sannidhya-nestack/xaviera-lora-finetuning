Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells
All seem to say, throw cares away
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer
To young and old, beak and the bow
Ding dong ding dong, that is their song
With joyful ring, all caroling
One seems to hear words of good cheer
From everywhere, filling the air
Oh how they pound, praising the sound
O'er hill and dale, telling their tale
Gave in every meanwhile
People sing songs of good cheer
Christmas is here
Merry merry merry merry Christmas
Merry merry merry merry Christmas
On on they send, on with out end
Their joyful time to every home
Ding dong, ding dong
Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells
All seem to say, throw cares away
Christmas is here, bring a cheer
To young and old, meek and the bold
Ding dong ding dong, that is their song
With joyful ring, all care will lead
One seems to hear words of good cheer
From everywhere filling the air
Oh how they pound raising the sound
O'er hill and dale telling the tale
Gaily they ring while people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here
Merry merry merry merry Christmas
Merry merry merry merry Christmas
On on they send on with that end
Their joyful tone to every home
Dee
Ding dong, ding dong
Gail in the ring while people sing songs of good cheer
Christmas is here
Gail in the ring while people sing songs of good cheer
Jesus is here
Merry merry merry merry Christmas
Merry merry merry merry Christmas
On on they send on without end
Their joyful tone to every home
Ding dong ding dong ding dong
