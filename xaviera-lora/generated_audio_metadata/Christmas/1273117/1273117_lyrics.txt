Snow has fallen, crisp and bright
City sparkles with delight
Children's eyes are filled with glee
On this enchanted Christmas Eve
Hilly sleigh bells in the air
Magic moments everywhere
Enchanted Christmas Eve is here
Filled with love and holiday cheer
Hold me close, let's make it last
Cherishing the moments past
Candles flicker, warmth they bring
Voices carol, joy they sing
Hearts are full of a world aglow
In this night we feel it so
Hear the sleigh bells in the air
Magic moments everywhere
Enchanted Christmas Eve is here
Filled with love and holiday cheer
Hold me close let's make it last
Cherishing the moments past
Candles flicker warmth they bring
Voices carol, joy they sing
Hearts are full, the world aglow
In this night we feel it so
Hear the sleigh bells in the air
Magic moments everywhere, oh
Enchanted Christmas Eve is here
Filled with love and holiday cheer
Hold me close, let's make it last
Cherishing the moments past
Underneath the starry skies
Love reflected in your eyes
As we gather hand in hand
Together in this winter land
Enchanted Christmas Eve is here
Filled with love and holiday cheer
Hold me close let's make it last
Cherishing the moments past
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Underneath the starry skies
Love reflecting your eyes
As we gather hand in hand
Together in this winter land
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
