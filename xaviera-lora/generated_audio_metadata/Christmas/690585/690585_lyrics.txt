Oh, oh, oh, yeah
God rest you merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
From God our Heavenly Father a blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy (joy)
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, joy
Now to the Lord sing praises, all you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas is full with heavenly grace
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
No, comfort and joy
