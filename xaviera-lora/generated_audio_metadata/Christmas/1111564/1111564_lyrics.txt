Here we go once again as the season begins
I'm reminded of sweet memories
As the star makes its way
To the top of the tree
Golden carols drift on the breeze
I lay together kids writing letters
To Santa to answer their list
It's a matter of time
I'm so blessed to be in an old fashioned Christmas like this
Gingerbread on the stove
Gets my heart on the glow
If the snow doesn't fall, that's okay
As the mists with toes hung
I think of the one
That I get to wake up to each day
I'm there to gather kids writing letters
To Santa to answer their list
It's a magical season, I'm so blessed to be
On an old fashioned Christmas like this
Family together, kids writing letters
To Santa to answer their list
It's a matter of time
I'm so blessed to be in an old-fashioned Christmas like this
Here we go
Once again, as the season begins
Have an old fashioned Christmas
An old fashioned Christmas
Have an old fashioned Christmas like this
