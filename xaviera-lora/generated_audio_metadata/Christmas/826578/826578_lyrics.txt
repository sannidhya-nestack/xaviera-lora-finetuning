I've been away so long
And the holidays are never like they were at home
There are people all around me
Yet I'm all alone
There are artificial Christmas trees and artificial snow
And plastic kisses under plastic mistletoe
I'm longing to be back with the people that I know
There's no place like home, no place like home for Christmas
There's no place like home, no place I'd rather be
It may not be a mansion, but I don't care
I know, no matter what, I'll be welcome there
In this wide, wide world of all the places I've ever been
There's no place like home and this Christmas I'll be home again
There's no place like home, no place like home for Christmas
There's no place like home, no place I'd rather be
It may not be a palace
But I don't care
It's the grandest place on earth
love lives there
In this wide, wide world of all the places I've ever been
There's no place like home
No place like home
There's no place like home
And this Christmas I'll be home again
I'll be home again
I'll be home
I'll be home for Christmas
