December rumpus in the flesh world
Jubal bells clatter, diamonds swirl
Santa in a sleigh, heights outrageous
Diff bags swollen, vibes contagious
A frosty gut snack, top hat lean
North pole living, ice cream scene
Hoes in the workshop, eats their bump
Holiday spirit got everyone pumped
Let's shout to the sleigh bells, echoes bright
Red nose ride to the silent night
Candy cane canes, dance and gleam
Wings of wonderland and dreams supreme
Reindeer prance off tracks in snow
Gloves on, hands red, zing, bolts glow
Chestnut roast, out of fire, all round
Joyful noise is the only sound
Stockings hung up, tinsel on trees
Hot cocoa sipping, it's at ease
Marshmallow fluff clouds up high
Lights on roofs, twinkle stars in the sky
Let's talk to the sleigh bells, echoes bright
Red nose ride through the silent night
Candy cane canes dance and gleam
Look to wonderland, a dream supreme
Reindeer prance with trash and snow
Gloves off hands, reds and golds glow
Chestnut roast by the fire all round
Joyful noise is the only sound
Stockings hung up, tinsel on trees
Hot cocoa sipping, it's at ease
Marshmallow fluff clouds up high
Lights on roofs, twinkle stars in the sky
Let's jive to the sleigh bells, echoes bright
Red notes ride through the silent night
Candy cane canes dance and gleam
Winter wonderland, a dream supreme
