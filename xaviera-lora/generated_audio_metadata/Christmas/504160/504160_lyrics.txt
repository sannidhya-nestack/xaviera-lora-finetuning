What child is this, who laid to rest on Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet while shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this, this, this, this, this, this is Mary's lap is sleeping.
This is Christ, the King who shepherds, guard and angels sing
Days, days to bring Him love, the Babe, the Son of Mary.
Why lies He in such mean estate, where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian, fear, for sinners hear
The silent word is pleading
Nail's spear shall pierce him through
The cross be born for me, for you
Hail! Hail! The Word made flesh, the Babe, the Son of Mary
So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh, a peasant king to own Him
The King of Kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
Raise, raise a song on high
The Virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy for Christ is born
The Babe, the Son of Man
Praise, praise the song on high
The Virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy for Christ is born
Abave the Son of Mary
