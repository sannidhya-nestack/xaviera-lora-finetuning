What a hip little Christmas this is baby it's just you and me
The mistletoe is tapping, tinsel's dancing off the tree
While the chimney shimmies and the snowflakes shake
The world sings harmony
What a hip little Christmas this is gonna be
What a hip little Christmas this is
All the halls are decked with jive
No more bebop shopping days'til December 25
Hop the herald angels swingin' sway from side to side
What a hip little Christmas let those spirits fly across the sky
While Bing sings carols in the clouds you and I
Should be fast asleep by now we close our eyes
And listen carefully
Rudy's hoofin' it up on the roof and it's proof enough for me
What a hip little Christmas this is baby yes I do believe
Santa knew that I was good'cause he brought you to me
And I love you like the Dickens and I wish you joy and peace
What a hip little Christmas this is gonna be
Across the sky while Bing sings carols in the clouds
You and I should be fast asleep by now
We close our eyes and listen carefully
Rudy's hoofin' it up on the roof and it's hoofin' out for me
Why hit little Christmas this is baby it's just you and me
The mistletoe is tapping, tinsel's dancing off the tree
And I love you like the dickens and I wish you joy and peace
What a hip little Christmas this is
How about a couple Christmas kisses?
What a hip little Christmas this is gonna be
