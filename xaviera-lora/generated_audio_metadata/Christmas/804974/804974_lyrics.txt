Joy to the world, the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
Let heaven and nature sing
Let heaven and nature sing
Let heaven and heaven and nature sing
Joy to the world, the Saviour reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy
He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
The wonders of His love
The wonders of His love
And the wonders, the wonders of His love
The wonders of His love
The wonders of His love
The wonders, the wonders of His love
