Ba-da-doop-ba-doop, ba-da-doop, ba-da-doop-ba-doop
Ba-da-doop-ba-doo, ba-da-doop, ba-dadoop-ba-doop
Snowflakes falling with a beat so fine
Dancing shadows under twinkling lights
Gingerbread dreams and candy cane skies
Jazz it up with joy and surprise
Electric rhythms in the Christmas air
Swing your beats, bring a holiday flare
Ornaments slicing like stars at night
Get lost in the melody, everything right
Jingle jammin' through the frosty streets
Holiday grooves, feel the festive heat
Light it up, let your spirits fly
Christmas swing, reaching for the sky
Cello bells ringing, toe-tapping joy
Mistletoe whispers for every girl and boy
Wrap yourself in a melody so sweet
Christmas nights, let your heartbeats meet
Warm fireside, tempo in the glow
Rhythms mixed with flakes of snow
Gifts of groove, present in the air
Feel the love, spread it everywhere
Jingle jive in, through the busty streets
Holiday grooves, feel the best in the heat
Light it up, let your spirits fly
Christmas swing, reaching for the sky
(Badadum badadum badadum badadum)
(Badadum badadum badadim badadum badadum)
(Badadum badadum badadam badadum badadum)
(Badadum badadum badadam badadam badadam)
Jingle chiding through the frosty streets
Holiday grooves feel the festive heat
Light it up, let your spirits fly
Christmas swing, reaching for the sky
