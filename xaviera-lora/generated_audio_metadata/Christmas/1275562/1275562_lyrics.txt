Snow is falling, black and white
Twinkling stars in the night
Pine trees draped in silver frost
In the season nothing's lost
In the quiet hear the cheer
Christmas time is drawing near
The winters glow, the shining light
Fills our hearts with pure delight
In this wonder we all know
Love and joy in winter's glow
Carol sung by candles flame
Every voice a sweet refrain
Families gather, spirits high
Magic in the frosty sky
In the quiet, hear the cheer
Christmas time is drawing near
And winter's love, a shining light
Fills our hearts with pure delight
In this wonder we all know
Love and joy in winter's glow
Snowy paths where lovers tread
Underneath the skies of red
Holding hands we feel the spark
Warmth within the winter dark
Winter's glow, a shining light
Fills our hearts with pure delight
In this wonder we all know
Love and joy in this earth's glow
A winter's glow
