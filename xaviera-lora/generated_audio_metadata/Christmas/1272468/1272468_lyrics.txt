Sprinkle the snow so fine
Let's find that mistletoe and gather
Oh, this Christmas night
While the lights twinkle bright
We'll dance away the hours so tender
Oh, this Christmas night
The trees glow, it's shining bright
Joined hands, we'll hold on tight
And this Christmas will be
A very merry time, you and me
Songs of joy fill the air
I see you smile now beyond compare
Oh, this Christmas night
With the jingle bells near
Laughing together, feel the cheer
This Christmas night
The trees glow, it's shining bright
Joined hands, we'll hold on tight
And this Christmas will be
A very merry time, you and me
Snowflakes fall, we're wrapped in bliss
Sealed with a loving kiss
The joy's all around tonight
This Christmas feels just right
The trees glow, it's shining bright
Joint hands will hold on tight
And this Christmas will be
A very merry time, you and me
