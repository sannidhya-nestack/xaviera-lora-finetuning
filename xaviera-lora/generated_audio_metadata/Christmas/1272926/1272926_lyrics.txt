Jingle bells and merry songs
Children playing all day long
Candles glow, the fire's warm
Love and joy in every form
Families gather, smiles so bright
Hearts are glowing in the night
Christmas joy awaits us all
Feel the magic, heed the call
Wrap your dreams in festive light
Celebrate this wondrous night
Yeah, mm-mm, mm-mm
Snowmen built with hearts and scars
Echoes of our happy laughs
Gingerbread and candy canes
Memories that will remain
Families gather, smiles so bright
Hearts are growing in the night
Christmas joy awaits us all
Feel the magic, heed the call
Wrap your dreams in festive light
Celebrate this wondrous night
When this gap is not so bright
Hearts are glowing in the night
Christmas joy awaits us all
Feel the magic, heed the call
Wrap your dreams in festive light
Celebrate this wondrous night
Snowmen built with hats and scarves, echoes of our happy laughs
Gingerbread and candy canes, memories that will last night
Snowmen built with hats and scarves, echoes of our happy laughs
Gingerbread and candy canes, memories that will remain
Stars are shining up above
Guiding us with endless love
Through the cold our hearts will sing
Welcoming what Christmas brings
Christmas joy awakes us all
Feel the magic, heed the call
Wrap your dreams in festive light
Celebrate this wondrous night, mmh, mmh, mmh
