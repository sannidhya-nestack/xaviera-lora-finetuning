For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
To seek and save the lost
But the way that he must come
He came through an immaculate conception
He was born of a virgin
Many people say
That there is no way
For it must have been supernatural
He was no ordinary child
He was no ordinary child
Not just a baby
But he is the king of kings
He was no ordinary child
He was no
He is King Jesus, the Son of God
As we tell this Christmas story
Of the Child from Bethlehem
For we must speak of His glory
For He is the Great I Am
He came through an Immaculate Conception
He was born of a Virgin
Many people say that there is no way
For it must have been supernatural
He was no ordinary child
He was no ordinary child
Not just a baby
But he is the King of Kings
He was no ordinary child
He was no
He is King Jesus, the Son of God
So we sing Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, for we sing Hallelujah
We sing Hallelujah, Hallelujah
O Hail King Jesus, Hail Emmanuel
Son of David, King of Israel
Hail King Jesus, O hail Emmanuel
Son of David, King of Israel
We sing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
We sing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
