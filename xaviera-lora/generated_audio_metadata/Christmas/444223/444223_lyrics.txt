Joy to the world, the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing
Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
Wild fields and floods
Rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
He rules the world with truth and grace
And he makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His love
Wonders of His love
Wonders of His love
Wonders of His love
One hundred joy to the world
Heaven and nature sing
Heaven and nature sing
Heaven and nature sing
Have a joy to learn
Bringing joy to the, bringing joy to the, bringing joy to the, bringing joy
Bringing some joy to the world
