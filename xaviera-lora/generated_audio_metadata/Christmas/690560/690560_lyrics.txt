Here we come, a caroling among the leaves so green
Here we come, a wandering so fair to be seen
Love and joy come to you, and to you glad Christmas too
And God bless you and send you a happy new year
And God send you a happy new year
We are not daily beggars who beg from door to door
But we are neighbor's children whom you have seen before
Love and joy come to you and to you glad Christmas too
And God bless you and send you a happy new year
And God send you a happy new year
(audience laughing)
Love and joy come to you
And to you glad Christmas too
And God bless you and send you a happy new year
Can God send you a happy new year?
Ah
Bless the master of this house
The little children that round the table go
Love and joy come to you
And to you glad Christmas too
And God bless you and send you a happy new year
And God send you a happy new year
Love and joy come
And God bless you and send you a happy new year
And God bless you and send you a happy new year
And God send you a happy new year
New year
New York
