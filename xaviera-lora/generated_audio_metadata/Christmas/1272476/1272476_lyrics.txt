You know
May I have some fun?
Santa sleighs at the front door
Ready for the night show
Reindeers at the snowball dance tonight
Jingle bells through rooftops
With lightning tights and shimmy tops
No way they'll be such here but then they might
Well, nice sugar plums and more, yeah
Skipping around with mistletoe
How'd you find this joyful?
Dooba dooba Christmas cheer
Dooba dooba magic spear
We never lose the Christmas blues
Dooba dooba sincere
Snowflakes fall, the night is young
Candles sing up the street
Candy canes and gingerbread so sweet
Holidays and New Years, we're
Dancing in our festive beers, ain't no ways
That we might
Trust in ice, laughter on court
Twirl in the snow and out we go
Haven't you felt this time before
Do-Ba-Do Christmas cheer
Do-Ba-Do our magic's near
We never lose the Christmas blues
Do-Ba-Do our sincere
Stockings hung by the fireplace
Loved one smiles like other place
Holiday magic in the air
Hospital nothing can compare
Do-ba-do-a Christmas cheer
Do-ba-ba-do-a do-ba-do-a-bear
We never lose
We never lose the Christmas blues
Do-ba-do-a Toys'n' Sees
