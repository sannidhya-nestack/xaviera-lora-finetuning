Moon and dance on ice and crystal night
As rain gives shadow across the sky
Mitten handles tight
While snowmen stand as time slips by
Sleeps off a winter's child
Dream of wonderland so wild
Angels paint the clouds with gold
As Christmas stories all unfold
Let the magic never grow old
Barberies by fire, lights so warm
Hotels of elves and Santa's flight
Outside the window, gentle storm
Wraps the world in peaceful white
Sleep softly winter child
Dream of one that lasts a while
Angels paint the clouds with gold
As Christmas stories all unfold
Let the magic never go
Time stands still on Christmas Eve
When all the world starts to believe
And miracles that fill the air
And joy that sparkles everywhere
Sleep softly, winter child
Dream of wonder, less of what
Angels paint the clouds with gold
As Christmas stories all unfold
Let the magic never grow old
Time stands still on Christmas Eve
When all the world starts to believe
In miracles that fill the air
And joy that sparkles everywhere
Sleep's all free when's a child
Dream of wonder lasts a while
Angels paint the clouds with gold
As Christmas stories all unfold
Let the magic never hold
