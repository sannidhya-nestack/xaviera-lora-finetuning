Snow falls gently, night is clear
Holding you, my love so near
By the fire, warm and bright
Lost in love on this cold night
In the quiet, feel the cheer
Christmas time, my love is here
Christmas by the firelight
Hearts aglow
In your arms loves embers glow
In this season
Warmth and light
Christmas love burns through the night
Mistletoe and candles gleam
Sharing cocoa winter's dream
Every whisper soft and sweet
Hearts in rhythm love's heartbeat
In the quiet feel the cheer
Christmas time my love is here
Christmas by the firelight
Hearts that glow in your arms
Love's embers grow in this season
Warmth and light
Christmas love burns through the night
Whistletoe and candles gleam
Sharing cocoa winter's dream
Every whisper soft and sweet
Hearts in rhythm love's heartbeat
In the quiet feel the cheer
Christmas time our love is here
Christmas by the firelight
Hearts aglow in your arms
Love's embers grow in this season
Warmth and light
Christmas love burns through the night
Stars above, they light our way
Through this wondrous holiday
In your eyes, the world feels right
Christmas love, so pure and bright
Christmas love, burns through the night
