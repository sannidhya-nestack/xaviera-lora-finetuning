Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Shows people down city look like glitter
Ornaments hanging lights writing on twitter
Chimney puffing up cold nipping shiver
Arrows in the background souls gotta quiver
The reindeer flags headlights up in flight
Santa in the slight red suit shining bright
Stockings hanging tough by the fire light
Cookies on the counter not a crumb in sight
stiffness vibes presence wrapped in rainbow
Eggnog sipping toasting in the glow
Family tight, seasons make the love grow
Out on the terrace see the frosty window
Wrapped up in a blanket, Netflix marathon
On the lunar loop, taking back the dawn
Big tips sparkling'til the strips drawn
Open up the box, it's a correlation porn
Midnight strike, I was beyond the moon
Toys on leash, kids in a groove
Sleigh bells echo up above the roof
Magic in the eye, nothing can behoove
Big mass fires, peasants wrapped in rainbow
Fake knocks slipping, toasting in the glow
Family type seasons make the love grow
Out on the terrace see the frosty window
