One, two, three, four
Hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Passing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go laughing all the way
Bells on foxtails ring making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing a sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
All the fun it is to run in a one-horse open sleigh
Day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon this funny bro was seated at my side
The horse was lean and lame
This fortune seemed his lot
We got into a drifted bank and then we got up sought
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
