Slave elves ringing, elves swinging hammers
Breaking toilets down, wrapping up the glamour
Santa's list long, ain't no time for flattery
Candy cane flow, sweet and kind of battery
Don't fall hustle, working every muscle
Stocking stuff tight, ain't no room to tussle
Red deer fly high, slaves filled to the brink
Cookies by the fireplace, hang on for a drink
L factory cranking gifts rapid
Christmas cheer ain't nobody liking
Snow falling heavy
Lights twinkle merry
Joy on the assembly line gifts we carry
Hold our vibe
Ice cold and chilly
L's in the workshop popping now willy
Magic dust, sprinkle, shake, shakes, fly
New Year's Eve, gift-giver of the night
Gingerbread beets, icing versus sweet
Kringle in the air, nightlife on repeat
Elf hats tilted, swagger in the stride
Santa loves his crew, pride worldwide
Elf factory, cranking gifts rapid
Christmas cheer, ain't nobody like it
It's not falling heavy, lights twinkle merry
Joy on the assembly line gifts we carry
Gingerbread beats, icing versus sweet
Kringle in the air, nightlife on repeat
Elf hats tilted, swagger in the stride
Santa loves his crew, pride worldwide
Elf factory, cranking gifts rapid
Christmas cheer, ain't nobody lacking
Snow falling heavy, lights twinkle merry
Joy on the assembly line, gifts we carry
Gifts we carry
Gifts we carry
