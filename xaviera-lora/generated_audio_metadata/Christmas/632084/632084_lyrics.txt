We three kings of orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star
Star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Born a king on Bethlehem's plain
Gold I bring to crown him again
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign
Oh, star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Frankincense to offer have I
Incense stones a deity deny
Prayer and praising, almond raising
Worship Him, God on high
Oh
Star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Oh, star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
