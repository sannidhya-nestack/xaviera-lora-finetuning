Oh little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamlessly
The silent stars go by
Yet in my dark streets shineth the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight
Are met in thee tonight
Oh yeah
For Christ is born of Mary and gathered all above
While lord asleep the angels keep their wives of wandering love
For morning stars together proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King and peace to men on earth
And priests and men on earth
O holy child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sins and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel
Oh Lord Emmanuel, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight
And praises sing to God the King and peace to men on earth
Peace on earth
