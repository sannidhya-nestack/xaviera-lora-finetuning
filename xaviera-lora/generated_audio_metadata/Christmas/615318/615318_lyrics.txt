O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels, O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord
Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens of Bethlehem

Come and behold Him, born the King of Angels
O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord
O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord
