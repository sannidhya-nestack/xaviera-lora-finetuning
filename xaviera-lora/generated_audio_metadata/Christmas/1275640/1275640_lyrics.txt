Aurora lights across the sky
Dancing colors oh so high
Winter's night, a sparkling show
In this magic, hearts aglow
Silent whispers in the air
Christmas wonder everywhere
Northern lights a Christmas tale
Guiding us through snowy trails
In their glow we find our way
Celebrating Christmas day
Frozen lakes, a glassy sheen
Reflections of a festive scene
Families gather, stories told
By the fire warmth unfolds
Silent whispers in the air
Christmas wonder everywhere
Northern lights a Christmas tale
Guiding us through snowy trails
In their glow we find our way
Celebrating Christmas day
Frozen lakes, a glassy sheen
Reflections of a festive scene
Families gather, stories told
By the fire warmth unfolds
Silent whispers in the air
Christmas wonder everywhere
Northern lights, a Christmas tale
Guiding us through snowy trails
In their glow we find our way
Celebrating Christmas day
Stars above, they shimmer bright
Casting dreams in winter's light
Hand in hand, we share a kiss
In this season's gentle bliss
Northern lights, a Christmas tale
Guiding us through snowy trails
In the glow we find our way
Celebrating Christmas day
