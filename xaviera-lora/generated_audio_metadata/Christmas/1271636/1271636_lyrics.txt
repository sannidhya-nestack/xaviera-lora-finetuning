There's a storm brewing over the Smokies
And I've heard it's coming our way
But I don't care where it's headed
Here's where I'm gonna stay
Let's put one more log on the fire
I don't want you catching a cold
If the phone rings we won't answer
We've got all our worries on hold
We'll be okay
Mistletoeing while the embers are glowing
As we watch it snowing, Christmas Eve, oh
Mistletoeing while the winter wind's blowing
We'll be mistletoeing, you and me
Ooh, you and me
While the carolers are making their house calls underneath a sea of stars
While the stores are filled with shoppers and the highways jammed with cars
We'll be far from the hustle and bustle when the reindeer are making their flight
It's a cozy kind of feeling
As we wait for Santa tonight
We'll be mistletoeing
While the embers are glowing
As we watch it snowing
Christmas Eve
Oh, oh, yeah
Mistletoeing
While the winter wind's blowing
We'll be mistletoeing
You and me
Mistletoeing
While the embers are glowing
As we watch it snowing
Christmas Eve
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Mistletoe
While the winter wind's blowing
We'll be mistletoeing
You and me
You and me
You and me
You and me
