Snowflakes swirl, the lights glow bright, we'll make it through the night
Hand in hand, we'll face December's chill
Deck the halls, the tree is trimmed, our spirits never dimmed
Christmas means I can stay with you
Yes, Christmas means I can stay with you
And all our dreams will come true
With your love I feel complete
Together by the fire's heat
Christmas means I can stay with you
Softly now, the carols play
We'll laugh and hear them say
Love grows stronger with each passing year
Gifts are wrapped, the candles clean, we'll live our Christmas dream
Christmas means I can stay with you
Yes, Christmas means I can stay with you
And all our dreams will come true
With your love I'll feel complete, together by the fire's heat
Christmas means I can stay with you
Snow outside, but here's our home, won't now face it alone
Love like this is oh so true
Christmas means I can stay with you
Yes, Christmas means I can stay with you
And all our dreams will come true
With your love I feel complete
Together by the fire's heat
Christmas means I can stay with you
