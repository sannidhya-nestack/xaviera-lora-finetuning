Snowflakes twirl in gentle dance
Midnight whispers in romance
Lights that twinkle warm and bright
Hold me close through winter's night
Far place crackles soft and low
Cocoa mugs in afterglow
Silent streets and snowy gaze
Warmth and love this Christmas days
Silence now fulfills the air
Linter magic everywhere
Soft and sweet like dreams unfold
Christmas tales both new and old
Do do do do, do do do do, do do do do
Window frosted canvas white
Glimmering stars in rum light
Wrap me in your arms tonight
Holidays perfect delight
Carols hum through frosty breeze
Feathery snow on silent trees
Laughing hearts in pleasant cheer
Hoping you'll stay always near
Silent snow fulfills the air
Winter magic everywhere
Soft and sweet like dreams unfold
Christmas tales both new and old
Do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do
Fallen snow through frosty breeze
Feathery snow on silent trees
Laughing hearts in pleasant cheer
Hoping you'll stay always near
Silence not fulfills the air
Winter magic everywhere
Soft and sweet like dreams unfold
Christmas tales both new and old
Do do do do, do do do do, do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do, Do do do do
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
