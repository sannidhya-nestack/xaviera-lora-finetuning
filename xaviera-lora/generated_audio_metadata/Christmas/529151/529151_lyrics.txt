Are you ready for Christmas?
It's coming, you know, with presents and packages
Ribbons and bowls
The lights and the ornaments are
Hung on a tree
And there's gifts piled high
For you and for me
It's time to get ready for Christmas
And when you start
Begin with your heart
Are you ready for Christmas?
It'll be here right quick
With snowmen and reindeer
And jolly Saint Nick
The carols, the laughter
The Jingle Bell Jeans
With drummer boys drumming and
Five golden rings it's time to
Get ready for Christmas and when you start
Begin with your heart
The kids are all wound up, it's well on its way
The radio tells us ten times a day
We're shopping and stopping all over town
Sometimes it's best to just slow down
Are you ready for Christmas?
Oh, where to begin?
How about in a small town with no room at the inn
With Mary and Joseph and angels who sing
And wise men bowing before the new king
It's time to get ready for Christmas and when you start
Begin with your heart
Christmas is coming
Are you ready for Christmas?
Christmas is coming
Are you ready for Christmas?
Christmas is coming
Are you ready for Christmas?
Christmas is coming
Are you ready for Christmas?
Christmas is coming
Are you ready for Christmas?
Christmas is coming
