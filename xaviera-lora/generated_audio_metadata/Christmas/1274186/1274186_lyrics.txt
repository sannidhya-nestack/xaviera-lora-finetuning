And I'd say bells echo clear
Through the silence drawing near
Moonlit paths of silver sheen
The spurred tails of what has been
When my sleigh bells guide our way
In the hush of night we sway
Stars above they softly sing
Of the magic this night brings
Frosted breath in the still air
Moments caught without a care
Twinkling lights on distant hills
Carry dreams and winter chills
Through the shadows, glimmers of light
Hope reborn in darkest night
Hand in hand we chase the sound
Finding joy where love is found
Night sleigh bells guide our way
In the hush of night we sway
Stars above they softly sing
Of the magic this night brings
In the quiet hearts align
Wrapped in warmth our spirits shine
Echoes of a timeless grace
Lingering in this sacred space
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
