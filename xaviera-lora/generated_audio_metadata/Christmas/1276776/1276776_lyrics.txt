Snowflakes dance in twilight's hue
Softly fall in the end due
Candles flicker hearts ignite
In a warmth of Christmas night
In the glow of your tight cheer
Love grows stronger year by year
Candlelight and carols sung
Hearts united old and young
In this season love will light
Every dark and silent night
Laughter shared by fireside
Wrapped in warmth, no need to hide
Mistletoe and stolen kiss
Moments filled with purest bliss
In the glow of you, tight cheer
Love grows stronger year by year
Candlelight and carol sung
Hearts united, old and young
In this season love will light
Every dark and silent night
Laughter shared by fireside
Wrapped in warmth, no need to hide
Mistletoe and stolen kiss
Moments filled with purest bliss
In the glow of yuletide cheer
Love grows stronger year by year
Candlelight and carol sung
Hearts united, old and young
In this season love will light
Every dark and silent night
Eyes above the guiding beam
Leading us through winter's dream
In your eyes the world feels right
Christmas love so pure and bright
In this season love will light
Every dark and silent night
Laughter shared by fireside
Wrapped in warmth, no need to hide
Mistletoe and stolen kiss
Moments filled with purest bliss
In the glow of your tight cheer
Love grows stronger year by year
Candlelight and carol sung
Hearts united, all and none
In this season love will light
Every dark and silent night
