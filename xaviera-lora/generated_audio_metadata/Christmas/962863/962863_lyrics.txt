Come and join me, it's time for Christmas
Streets are shining with sparkling lights
We'll have so much fun here at Christmas
Stars will make the night so bright
Cherish every good thing at Christmas
Kiss me under the mistletoe
Light the fireplace and roast some chestnuts
Cause it's Christmas time
Look, the snow is falling down
It's covering the town
And kids are all waiting for Santa Claus
Look, the snow is falling down
It's covering the town
And kids are all waiting for Santa Claus
When you hear the silver bells ringing
You know reindeer are on the way
Write some cards and wrap all the presents
Let's enjoy the holiday
Come and join me it's time for Christmas
Let the atmosphere warm your heart
So much fun here at Christmas
Time for laughing, time for praying
We love the holidays
