Late at night, the world is calm and still
Snowflakes falling gently, covering the hill (oh yeah)
Peace on earth, as the stars brightly shine
Silent night, a moment frozen in time
Families gather'round, fires warm glow (oh yeah)
Singing songs, feeling the love in the air now (oh yeah)
Wrapped in blankets, sipping hot cocoa
Embracing the magic as the melodies flow, yeah
Oh silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
