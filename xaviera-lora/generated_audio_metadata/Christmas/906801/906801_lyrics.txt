The years first snow it brought me back
To a Christmas time when all we had was nothing
And everything
Five years ago on Christmas Eve
A little girl was sitting on the floor of
An old apartment watching the snow fly
She said, "Mama, Mama, listen, Mama, listen, Mama, can you hear that sound?"
Is it Santa, has he come to bring me all the toys I wanted
All year round, you think he'll find me
Her mama looked at her and said
Baby girl you oughta know
The times are tough this year
But don't you be afraid that Santa won't find his way here
it's not about the presents, no
It's not about the toys
It's how you fill your heart with Christmas joy
That little girl got up and kissed him like a knight and went to bed
And as she left that little girl she saw her mama close her eyes
Wipe her tears and turn her head
That little girl went to her bedroom got down on her knees to pray
She said Lord I know my daddy is up there with you to stay
Can you give him a message for me?
Can you tell him that I said
Daddy, I'm sure you know
The times are tough this year
But I'm not afraid that Santa won't find his way here
it's not about the presents, no
It's not about the toys
Can you just fill Mama's heart with Christmas joy?
On Christmas moon that little girl
Found her mama by the tree
She ran to her daughter
Picked her up, put her on her knee
She said, "Baby girl, I love you more than anything"
Your dad was in my dream last night
Do you know what he said to me?
He said, "Baby girl, oh baby girl"
Times worse off this year
But don't you be afraid that Santa
Won't find his way here, no
Our daughter don't want no presents, no
She don't care about the toys
She just wanted to fill your heart with Christmas joy
I'm always here for you, my Christmas joy
