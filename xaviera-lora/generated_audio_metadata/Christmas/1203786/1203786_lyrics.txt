O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morning
Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh now
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, O night divine
Chains shall he break, for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night
When Christ was born, oh night divine, oh night
When Christ was born, oh
Oh night divine
Oh, oh
On your knees
