Exuding silence'til the night
Upon the windowsill
The moon seems to tiptoe by
The deep sky so still
When every single star
Seems to have
Something to say
Remembering the time
When one lived the Three Kings way
My heart goes jingle
It's Christmas time
Snowflakes always fall
It's Christmas time
Love has come a circle
It's Christmas time, sparkling lights twinkle
It's Christmas time, my heart goes jingle
It's Christmas time, snowflakes always fall
It's Christmas time, love has come a circle
It's Christmas time, sparkling lights twinkle
It's Christmas time
The dew drops hit the light
A promise to fulfill
Beyond the dark blue clouds
I'll find my fill
When every heart is blessed
With sounds of the sleigh
Jingling, ringing, singing now
Someone lights the way
My heart goes jingle
It's Christmas time
Snowflakes always fall
It's Christmas time, love has come a circle
It's Christmas time, sparkling lights twinkle
It's Christmas time, my heart goes jingle
It's Christmas time, snowflakes always fall
It's Christmas time, love has come a circle
It's Christmas time, sparking lights twinkle
It's Christmas time
