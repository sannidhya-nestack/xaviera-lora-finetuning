Oh, oh, oh
What child is this so late to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet
With phantoms sweet while shepherds watch are keeping
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him love
To babe, the son of Mary
Why lies he in such mean estate?
Where ox and donkeys are feeding
Could Christians fear for sinners here?
The silent world is pleading
His steel shall pierce him through
To cross he barred for me, for you
Hail, hail the Word made flesh
To obey the Son of Mary
So bring him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant king to own him
To king of kings salvation brings
Let laughing hearts enthrone him
Raise, raise this song on high
To virgins sings all love high
Joy, joy for Christ is born
To babe, to son of Mary
