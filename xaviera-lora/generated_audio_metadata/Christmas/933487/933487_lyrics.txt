Glory to God in the highest, glory to the Lord, Amen
Glory to God in the highest
There's a baby born in Bethlehem
Glory to God in the highest
Glory to the Lord, Amen
Glory to God in the highest
There's a baby born in Bethlehem
And all the angels sang with joy
Joy, Bethlehem joy
Sweet music filled the sky with joy
Wonderful Bethlehem joy
Wisemen came and knelt by the baby
Knelt by the baby
Precious gifts they wanted to bring
Then all of heaven and earth rejoiced
Celebrating this new born King
Yes, He's Jesus, the King of Kings
And all of heaven sang with joy, joy
Bethlehem joy
Sweet music filled the sky with joy
Wonderful Bethlehem joy
Can you imagine what the shepherds thought
When they heard about the Savior's birth?
They saw the star join the angels' song
Singing peace, goodwill on earth
And all the people sing joy, joy, Bethlehem joy (mm yeah, mm yeah, mm yeah)
She needs to be excited, joy, joy, joy (oh that joy, oh that joy, oh that joy, oh that joy)
You gotta believe that we will do it, joy, joy, joy
Joy, joy, joyful Bethlehem joy
You know that Bethlehem joy
Sweet music fill the sky with joy
Joy, joyful Bethlehem joy
That joy, that joy
Joy, joy, joyful Bethlehem joy
Joy, joy, joyful Bethlehem joy
You know I'm talking about that joy, joy
Talkin'bout the dark (Talkin'bout the dark)
