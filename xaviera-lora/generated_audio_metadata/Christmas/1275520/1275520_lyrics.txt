Soft lights flicker, shadows play
Warmth surrounds us, a gentle sway
In the silence, disperse of cheer
Moments together
Wrapped in love, the night feels right
Under stars, we find our light
Breath of winter, calm and slow
In this magic, oh
Will glow
Silent snowflakes
Softly fall
Dreams of laughter
Can hear the call
With every heartbeat
Time stands still
In this moment I feel the thrill
Wrapped in love the night feels right
Under stars we find our light
New breath of winter
Calm and slow
In this magic our hearts will glow
Silent snowflakes
Softly fall
Dreams of laughter
We hear the call
With every heartbeat
Time stands still
In this moment I feel
