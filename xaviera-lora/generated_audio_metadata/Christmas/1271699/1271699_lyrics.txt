Santa Claus got lost while on a sleigh ride
Rudolph and the reindeer flew away
Someone said the presents they got hijacked
Up in the projects East LA
Merry Christmas, merry merry Christmas
Happy New Year, happy happy New Year
Merry Christmas, happy New Year too
Merry Christmas to you
Jack Frost he made sure the roads were frozen
Cars went skidding down Route 66
Soccer moms stood by their banged up Humvees
Sending their insurance cell phone pics
Merry Christmas, merry merry Christmas
Happy new year, happy happy new year
Merry Christmas
Happy new year to
Merry Christmas to you
Sprinkle fairy pixie dust on Santa's magic bus
it starts rising up
Sprinkle fairy pixie dust on Santa's magic bus
it starts rising, oh
Merry Christmas, merry merry Christmas
Happy new year, happy happy new year
Merry Christmas, happy new year to you
Merry Christmas to you (to you)
Merry Christmas to you (you)
You
