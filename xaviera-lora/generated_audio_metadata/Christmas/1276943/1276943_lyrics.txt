Jingle bells be ringing (ooh yeah)
Electric bikes are singing (uh-huh)
Groovin' in the snow (yuh)
Set us out to swing (yuh) (woo)
Candy canes and hot cocoa (uh)
Dancing'neath the mistletoe (ha-ha)
Rain gear prancing through the streets (yeah)
Jazzy jams with funky beats (wee)
Christmas magic in the air (oh)
Feel the rhythm everywhere (yeah)
Clap your hands and stomp your feet (let's go)

Frosty on the funky train (it's true)
Twinkle lights in every lane (hey Jack)
Frost got that groove (uh-huh)
Santa's sleigh is on the move (keep up)
Snowflakes falling softly down (so light)
Parties hopping all around right
Elves and barking toys in hand (oh yeah)
Funky times across the land (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Christmas magic in the air
Feel the rhythm everywhere
Clap your hands and stomp your feet
Ho ho, feel the beat
Christmas magic in the air (whoa)
Feel the rhythm everywhere (hey)
Clap your hands and stomp your feet (let's go)
Ho, ho, ho, feel the beat (come on)
