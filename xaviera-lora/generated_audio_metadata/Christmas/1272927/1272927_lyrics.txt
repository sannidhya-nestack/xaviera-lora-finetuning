Snowflakes falling, lights are glowing
Every street a festive showing
Children's laughter fills the air
Magic's everywhere
All around the cheer is growing
Warmth and love hearts overflowing
Christmas time is here again
Feel the joy with family and friends
Let's celebrate, no time to wait
This holiday, let's make it great
Cookies baking, stockings hanging
Cavaliers with songs they're singing
Fireplaces burning bright
Cozy winter night
All around the cheer is growing
Warmth and love hearts overflowing
Christmas time is here again
Feel the joy with family and friends
Let's celebrate, no time to wait
This holiday, let's make it great
Underneath the mistletoe
Feel the love and let it show
Presents wrapped a special glow
Memories will still
Christmas time is here again
Feel the joy with family and friends
Let's celebrate, no time to wait
This holiday, let's make it great
