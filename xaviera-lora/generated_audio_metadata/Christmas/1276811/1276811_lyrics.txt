Gingerbread roofs and candy cane lanes
Snowflakes fall like sweet champagne
Icicles hang like chandelier bling
While the elves backstage all swing
Wrapped up lights, blue soft and sleek
Santa works on a holiday break
Chimneys puff in a foggy mist
What a reindeer on the checklist, mm-mm-mm
Silent nights full of jazzy groove
Snowman swaying, special to its use
Bells and gates all harmonized
And they twinkle lights through overdrive
Pop chocolate brews in the silent night
Dark cocoa that's extra bright
Jazz notes dance in a minor key
In our peppermint symphony
Stockings sway to the Christmas beat
Underneath the holly and dancing feet
Feast on tunes and sweet delight
This holiday jam feels just right
Silent nights full of jazzy groove
Snowman sway and specialty lute suits
Bells and beats all harmonized
Turn your twinkle lights to overdrive
Stalking the sway to the Christmas beat
Underneath the holly and dancing feet
Feast on tunes and sweet delight
This holiday jam feels just right
Silent nights full of jazzy groove
Snowman swaying special tailored suits
Bells and beats all harmonized
In your twinkle lights to overdrive
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
