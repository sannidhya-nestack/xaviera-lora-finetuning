Snow flutters around, lights all around
Children laughing, joy in the sound
Presence in sight, candles so bright
Hugs and cheer, love through the night
Joy to the world
Boys and girls sing out loud
Join the crowd
Bells ringing clear
Family near
Hearts so warm magic here
Joy to the world
Boys and girls sing out loud
Join the crowd, laughter and fun
Under the sun, holiday cheer
Time has begun, presents in sight
Candles so bright, hugs and cheer
Love through the night, joy to the world
Boys and girls
Sing out loud
Join the crowd
Bells ringing clear
Family near
Hearts so warm
Magic here
Hearts so warm
Magic here
Bells ringing clear
Family near, heart so warm, magic here
Bells ringing clear, family near
Heart so warm, magic here
Laughter and fun, under the sun
Holiday cheer time has begun
