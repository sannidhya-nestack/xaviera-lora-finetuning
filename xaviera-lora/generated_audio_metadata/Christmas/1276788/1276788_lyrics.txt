Santa's got his goof on tonight
Reindeer's dancing in pure delight
Elves are swinging by the tree
It's a jingle and jive jubilee
Snow is falling, rhythm's tight
Candy canes and twinkly lights
Starting song by the fire's glow
Feel the beat, let's start the show
Jingle and jive, oh what a sight
Christmas cheer in every bite
Tap your toes and swing along
Celebrate with dance and song
Gingerbread men on the floor
Sway to the bells we all adore
Presents piled high with care
Wrapped in joy and love to share
Take the halls and move your feet
Magic pulses in the beat
Drum and bass with sleigh bells ring
Dreams made of the swing
Jingle and jive oh what a sight
Christmas cheer in every bite
Tap your toes and swing along
Celebrate with dance and song
Jingle gratin' on the floor
Sway to the bells we all adore
Presents pilin' high with care
Wrapped in joy and love to share
Tack the halls and move your feet
Magic pulses in the beat
Drum and bass with sleigh bells ring
Dreams are made of this swing
Chewin' on the jive, oh what a sight
Cream is cheerin' every bite
Tuck your toes and swing along
Celebrate with dance and song
