Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas
Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho
Holding hands out in the cold
Jingle bells ringing on the radio
I remember falling in love
Under mistletoe and stars above
But here you were the only thing on my list
This Christmas got me reminiscing
There was magic in every minute
Of our first Christmas
Picking out the perfect tree
Decorating in red and green
Hanging stockings from twinkling lights
By the fire on snowy nights
Keeping warm with polar bear kisses
This Christmas got me reminiscing
There was magic in every minute
Of our first Christmas
Now every Christmas is better with you in it
Didn't know what I'd been missing
our first Christmas
Candy cane days and cocoa nights
A winter wonderland with you by my side
This Christmas got me reminiscing
There was magic in every minute
Of our first Christmas
Now every Christmas is better with you in it
Didn't know what I'd been missing
our first Christmas (Fa-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la)
(Fa-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la)
(Fa-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la)
(Fa-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la)
