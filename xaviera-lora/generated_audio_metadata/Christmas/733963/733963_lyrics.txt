I'm your present, open me first
You were a bad boy, you got what you deserve
I'm wrapped in love today
Gonna jingle your bells baby
All the way, been saving up for this all year
And I don't care if it snows or rains dear
I'm gonna keep you warm
This Christmas morning I'm yours
I'm your present who needs toys
I'm your sugar plum you little drummer boy
Come on and shake my tree
Gonna take you for a slayer
I'd make you shout with glee
Got stockings full of goodies for you
Let the chestnuts burn, baby
We will too, unchide my bow
Oh, oh, oh
I'm yours
I'm your presence
I'm your prison, no assembly required
Don't need no batteries, I never get tired
No need to wind me up at all
Hey, I'm your living, I'm your breathing
Bobby doll, oh baby when you made your list
Well, were you wishin' and hopin' for a get-to-life-ass?
Well, it's a little too late
I can't be exchanged
I'm yours
'Cause I'm your present
Ooh, Merry Christmas, baby
Ooh, I'm your present
