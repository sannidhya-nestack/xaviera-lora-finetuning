To everyone in a warmer climate
We may not have a Christmas of white
But there's a place and I know you can find it
Guaranteed to make your season bright
The neighborhood is all decked out
Lights hanging from every corner
And everyone knows what it's about
Jesus was born in a manger
So if you wanna go
And if there won't be snow
Let it rain, let it rain
For it's Christmas time once again
Let it rain, let it rain
As we walk down Christmas tree lane
There's no gift that I could receive
Better than you walking with me
Holding hands in the winter night
Hot chocolate by the fireside
So let me take you by the hand
To a winter wonderland
And let it rain, let it rain
For it's Christmas time once again
Let it rain, let it rain
As we walk down Christmas tree lane
Grab your coat, don't et your umbrella
Hear a song by Frank Pingarella
You never know just what's in store
But who could ask for anything more?
Let it rain for it's Christmas time once again
Let it rain, let it rain
As we walk down Christmas tree lane (as we walk down Christmas tree lane)
Let it rain (let it rain)
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
As we walk down Christmas tree lane
Later on we'll have a silent night
All is calm and all is bright
