I saw you on the frozen streets with packages and bowls
The decorations were just like icing made of gold
The shops were filled with the smell of oh so sticky sweet
It lingered as I rushed back home where Santa waits for me
Under the tree something's there for me
Under the tree
It's wrapped so cheerfully
Oh sleep come slow tonight
I can't wait for light
To see what you've left for me
Under the tree
Through the window I could see a blanket of pure white
And just in a mistletoe where you kissed me last night
Choruses of bells were playing in the room
I caught a glimpse of you going up the chute
Under the tree something's there for me
Under the tree, it's wrapped so cheerfully
Oh sleep come slow tonight,'cause I can't wait for a light
To see what you've left for me, under the tree
Shreds of paper fill the air
There's merrymaking everywhere
Bellies filled with lovely treats
And empty stockings now fit my feet
But under the tree, one more waits for me
Under the tree
It's wrapped so cheerfully
Oh it's such a lovely sight
So I laugh with delight
At what you left for me
Under the tree
Under the tree
Under the tree
Under the tree
