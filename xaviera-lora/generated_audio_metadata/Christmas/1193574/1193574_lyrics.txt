Let's build a fire from a spark, let it light up the dark
Cozy up for the night with some ginger delight
Something'bout this time of year
Always brings me so much cheer
You put the jingle in my jingle bells
Wouldn't be the same with anyone else
I love doing Christmas with you
Nothing better, you and me together
I love doing Christmas with you
Every December is one to remember
When we're hand in hand in a
Wonderland tell me how could I be blue
I love love love doing Christmas with you
Your little cocoa kiss is at the top of my list
Sugar cookie bliss on your cinnamon lips
Something'bout this time of year
Always brings me so much cheer
You put the tinsel on my evergreen
You're all the holly and the jolly I need
I love doing Christmas with you
Nothing better you and me together
Doing Christmas with you
Every December is one to remember
When we're hand in hand in a wonderland
Tell me how could I be blue
I love love love doing Christmas with you
Something'bout this time of year
Always brings me so much cheer
You put the tinsel on my evergreen
You're all the holly and the jolly I need
I love doing Christmas with you
Nothing better, you and me together
I love doing Christmas with you
Every December is one to remember
When we're hand in hand in a bed
Won't the land tell me how could I be blue?
I love love love doing Christmas
I love love love doing Christmas with you
