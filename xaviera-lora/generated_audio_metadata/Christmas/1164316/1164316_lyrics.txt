It's gonna be a Christmas that you won't et
It's gonna be a Christmas, the best one yet
Come on baby, hang the mistletoe
Here comes Santa Claus, ho, ho, ho
Of Christmas you won't et
It's gonna be a Christmas (Christmas)
That you won't et (you won't et)
It's gonna be a Christmas (Christmas)
The best one yet (the best one yet)
Come on, put up the Christmas tree
Girls, we're going on a shopping spree
Of Christmas you won't et
Bring on the eggnog, light up the eulog
Christmas caroling, my uncle's embarrassing
It's gonna be a Christmas you won't et
It's gonna be a Hanukkah that you won't et (you won't et)
It's gonna be a Hanukkah
The best one yet (the best one yet)
Light the candles, set the table
Say a prayer and spin the cradle of Hanukkah
You won't et
It's gonna be a new year (new year)
That we won't et (you won't et)
It's gonna be a new year (new year), the best one yet (the best one yet)
See you in Times Square for the ball drop
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five
(4, 3, 2, 1, Happy New Year)
Happy New Year, you won't et
Bring on the holidays
Pack up your suitcase
Eating all the candy canes
And etting all your cousins names
It's gonna be a holiday, you won't et
Come on baby won't you let it snow
It's the time of year you'll never outgrow a Christmas you won't et
It's gonna be a Christmas that you won't et
It's gonna be a Christmas the best one yet
Can't you hear the sleigh bells ringing
Plug your ears cause grandma's singing out Christmas you won't et
It's gonna be a Hanukkah we won't et
It's gonna be a Kwanzaa we'll never et (oh yeah)
It's gonna be a Christmas we'll never et
