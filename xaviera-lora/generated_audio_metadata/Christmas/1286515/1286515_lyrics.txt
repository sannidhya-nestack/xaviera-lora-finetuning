Snowflakes fall on silent streets
Crisp air where city heartbeat beats
Lights twinkle in a silver tree
Chilling in serenity
Sweater weather and a warmer place
Candles flicker at a gentle pace
Hot cocoa dreams beneath the star
Feels like paradise ain't that bizarre
Winter whispers magic in the breeze
Moments frozen in a wondrous freeze
Pack yourself in the quiet night
Everything feels so right
Footprints gently mark the snow
Silent footsteps where lovers go
Late night laughter fills the air
Holiday spirit everywhere
Footprints gently mark the snow
Silent footsteps where lovers go
Late night laughter fills the air
Holiday spirit everywhere
Winter whispers magic in the breeze
Moments frozen in a wondrous freeze
Wrap yourself in a quiet night
Everything feels so right
Midnight tales and cozy vibes
We got time, no need to rush the ride
Memories made in the simple moments
Holiday joy, pure bliss components
