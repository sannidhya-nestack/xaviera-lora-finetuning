The word of Santa won't come around
His herd of deer won't leave the ground
He won't pay you any mind
If you're not being kind
I heard if you're not living right
Your crib he'll skip
But it'd be thoughtful to be naughty tonight
Then save Santa the trip (I think we are)
Save Santa the trip (I think we are)
Save Santa the trip (I think we are)
Save Santa the trip (I think we are)
I'm impressed how you try to be good
You kept your cool like Jeff Frost would
Me I'm more like the Grinch instead
Besides the shorties tucked in bed
The in-laws are all out of sight
I think we gave'em the slip
So it'd be thoughtful to be naughty tonight
And safe side of the trip
I think Priyanka
And safe side of the trip
I think Priyanka
Safe side of the trip
I think Priyanka
Safe side of the trip
I think Priyanka
He could use the free time
Maybe catch a few rays
There's plenty other stockings he can fill
It would be so sublime
To heat up the holidays
We could help spread all of that goodwill
I see it's 1224 again
Peace on earth, goodwill to men
Some will try to be so nice
Some will choose their favorite pies
I'm not here to start a fight
Or come off tragically hip
Well maybe
But it'd be thoughtful to be naughty tonight
Save Santa the trip
I think he oughta
Save Santa the trip
I think he oughta
Safe side of the trip (I think we oughta)
Safe side of the trip (I think we oughtta)
Safe side of the trip (I think we ought)
Safe side of the trip (I think we ought to)
Safe side of the trip (I think we oughtto)
Safe side of the trip (I think we oughtta)
