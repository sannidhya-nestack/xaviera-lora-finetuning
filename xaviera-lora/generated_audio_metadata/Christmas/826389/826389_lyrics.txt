The snow and the Christmas lights
Shine in the street
It sure is pretty
There's a place I'd rather be
I won't miss the long cold nights
Bitter days and snowball fights
I won't be wearing the Christmas sweater
I gotta go to warmer weather
Sunshine makes it all so much better
Christmas with my family
That's where I oughta be
But I dream of a white Christmas
On a sandy beach
I'll miss you but I'll see you soon
I get more time off in June
Sorry we won't be together
I gotta go to warmer weather
Sunshine makes it all so much better
Don't look for a Christmas card
Of some old snowy scene
I'll send you a postcard
Of the best waves you've ever seen
I'll draw a snowman on the beach
With seaweed hair and clamshell teeth
Yuletide spirit, yeah, whatever
I gotta go to warmer weather
Sunshine makes it all so much better
I gotta go to warmer weather
