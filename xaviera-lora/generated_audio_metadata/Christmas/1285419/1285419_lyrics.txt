Star lights glowing on the streets tonight
Neon reindeer taking flight
City buzzing like a holiday
Laser beams and candy cane displays
Electric elves in a digitized sleigh
Robotics in a honest merry way
Organized chaos in each fight
Presents delivered by electric light
Wishing you a plugged in Christmas cheer
Holiday beats on a symphysphere
Reindeer gliding through a digital mist
An electric holiday he can't resist
Holograms of snowflakes falling
Smart lights deck the halls enthralling
Pixel trees that dance in sync
Mistletoe made of fiberlink
Gifts don't need no wrapping here
3D printed joy this year
Whisked away on cyberspace
Yuletide glows in every place
Wishing you were plugged in Christmas cheer
Holiday beats on a synthesphere
Reindeer gliding through a digital mist
An electric holiday you can't resist
Wishing you a plugged-in Christmas cheer
Holiday beats on a synthesphere
Reindeer gliding through a digital mist
An electric holiday you can't resist
