Sleigh bells ringing
Frosties waving as we go
Snowflakes falling
We don't mind the cold
No, no, no
It's Christmas time, ooh ooh ooh
Every time your hands are mine
Tell me that you feel it too
Whenever I'm with you
It's Christmas time
Are you listening?
Jingle, jingling all the way
The path is glistening
Like a gleaming Milky Way
Hey, hey, hey
It's Christmas time, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Every time your hand's in mine
Tell me that you'll be the jewel
Whenever I'm with you
It's Christmas time
What do you say?
It could be Christmas each day
As long as I have you by my side
It's Christmas time
Every time your hands in mine
Tell me that you feel it too
Whenever I'm with you
It's Christmas time
Baby, put your hand in mine
it feels so fine
It's Christmas time
