A firelight glows from the window, twinkling paints
White winter softly sings with snowflake tunes
It's time to light up the dark, it's time to light up the harp
It's that time in December when the stars shine with cheer
And there's love all around me
And there's love all around me
Smiling faces greet each other
Twinkling shop lights
Laughter brimming over
Linking hearts red
It's time to light up the dark
It's time to light up the heart
It's that time in December
When the greatest gift is near
And there's love all around me
And there's love all around me
Warm hands to hold my heart, silence unbound
I meet your eyes and know for sure all that's lost is found
It's time to light up the dark, it's time to light up the heart
It's that time in December when jingling bells are here
And there's love all around me
And there's love all around me
And there's love all around me
And there's love all around me
Every song is a prayer
Rung unto the white heavens
Every life is a prayer
Lived in brilliant green and blue
And there's love all around me
And there's love all around me
And there's love all around
All around me
And there's love
All around me
And there's love
All around me
And there's love
All around me
And there's love
All around me
And there's love
All around me
