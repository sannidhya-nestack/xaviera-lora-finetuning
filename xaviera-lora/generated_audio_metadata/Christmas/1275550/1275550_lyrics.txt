Frosty pace, the world asleep
Dreams of joy are running deep
Fireplace crackles, shadows dance
In this moment, love's romance
Stars above, they softly gleam
Guiding us in this sweet dream
Your tight whispers soft and clear
Fill our hearts with Christmas cheer
In this season pure delight
Hold me close this silent night
Carol sung in harmony
Voices blend so tenderly
Children's eyes with wonder shine
In this magic love we find
Stars above they softly gleam
Guiding us in this sweet dream
Your tight whispers soft and clear
Fill our hearts with Christmas cheer
In this season pure delight
Hold me close this silent night
Mistletoe hangs overhead
Promises in whispers said
In your arms the world feels right
Wrapped in warmth on this night
Your tight whispers soft and clear
Fill our hearts with Christmas cheer
In this season pure delight
Hold me close this silent night
