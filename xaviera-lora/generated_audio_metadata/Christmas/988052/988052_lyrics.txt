There was no Santa Claus, no wreath
Fancy decorations
Just us three little kids
Who made our own celebration
Poor Mama did her very best
To give life to our dreams
When she put those goodies
On our tiny Christmas tree
Tiny Christmas tree so beautiful
With your twinkling string of lights
Every Christmas brought us hope
Made our world look bright
Oh we never will et the joy
That we would feel
When Mama decorated that tiny Christmas tree
Tiny Christmas tree just three feet tall
With candy canes to share
In a corner by the window
Little wooden chair
Second hand angel on top
For everyone to see
How we loved those cookies
And chocolate drops so sweet
Tiny Christmas tree so beautiful
With your twinkling string of lights
Every Christmas brought us hope
And made our world look bright
Oh, we never will et the joy
That we would feel
When Mama decorated
That tiny Christmas tree
Now we are all grown up
With children of our own
We each have two Christmas trees that decorate our homes
One big special one with many presents underneath
And another to remember
Mama's tiny Christmas tree
Tiny Christmas tree
So beautiful with your twinkling string of lights
Every Christmas brought us hope
And made our world look bright
Oh, we never will et the joy
That we would feel
When Mama decorated
That tiny Christmas tree
Oh, we never will et you
Tiny Christmas tree
