Hark! The herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise
Joy that overflows
Of the skies with angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
On the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Christ, my highest heaven-adored
Christ, the everlasting Lord
Laid in time, behold Him come
Offspring of the virgin's womb
Held in flesh, the Godhead see
Held in corn, a deity
Priest as man with man to dwell
Jesus of Immanuel
All the herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King
Hail the heaven born Prince of Peace
Hail the Son of Righteousness
Light and life to all He brings
Priest with healing in His wings
Mountain King
This is glory by
Born that man, no war may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth
All the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
