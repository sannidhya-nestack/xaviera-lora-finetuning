Santa's sail blockin' proof
Rain-themed pants, you'll find them rude
Gifts are wrapped in neon hue
Snowflakes fall, a beat that's true
Santa's swingin' in the snow
Every town he glides below
Chimneys, pots, laughter bright
Making joy this wintery night
Elves are jamming in the shop
Candy canes, they never stop
Drums and strings, sleigh bell rings
Santa's song for all to sing
Santa swinging in the snow
Every town he glides below
Chimneys white, laughter bright
Making joy this wintery night
From North Pole the city's light
Santa's vibe will take its flight
Carving rhythms in the air
Magic tunes are everywhere
Santa's swinging in the snow
Every town implies below
Chimneys whites left abright
Making joy this wintery night
Santa's swinging in the snow
Every town flies below
Chillin' in these pods, laughter bright
Making joys with dream night
