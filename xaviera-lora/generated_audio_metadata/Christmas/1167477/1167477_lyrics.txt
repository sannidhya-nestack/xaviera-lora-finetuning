Snowflakes, they trickle on down
Beautiful blanket of white on the ground
Yeah it's cozy by the fire who could ask for more
But if we slip on our slippers and head out the door
We could be dancing, dancing in the snow
Your kiss is so warm and the nights are so cold
We'd be more than okay holding each other tight
Swaying to the rhythm of our hearts
Making magic under the stars
Baby, wouldn't you like to go dancing in the snow?
We checked everything off of our list
Cookies and milk are out for Saint Nick
Oh, string of lights are painting the stage
Softly calling our names
We could be dancing, dancing in the snow
Your kiss is so warm and the nights are so cold
We'd be more than okay holding each other tight
Swaying to the rhythm of our hearts
Making magic under the stars
Baby wouldn't you like to go dancing in the snow?
Oh, swaying to the rhythm of our hearts
Making magic under the stars
Wouldn't you like to go?
Oh, baby, I'm yours to hold
Oh, wouldn't you like to go?
Dancing in the snow, ah, ooh, ah
