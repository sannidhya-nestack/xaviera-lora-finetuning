Ornaments and twinkling lights
Homes that glow on winter nights
Choir singing voices blend
Holiday cheer around the bend
Love and laughter fill the air
Christmas spirit everywhere
In Christmas harmony we find
Joy and peace for all mankind
Sing together hearts entwined
In this season, love's defined
Gather'round the table, say
Sharing stories we won't et
Echoes of the past so near
Filled with warmth and endless cheer
Love and laughter filled the air
Christmas spirit everywhere
In Christmas harmony we find
Joy and peace for all mankind
Sing together hearts entwined
In this season love's defined
Through the cold and through the storm
In our hearts we keep it warm
With each carol let it show
Christmas magic let it grow
In Christmas harmony you find
Joy and peace for all men, mankind
Sing together hearts entwined
In this season love's divine
Ooh
Through the cold and through the storm
In our hearts we keep it warm
With each carol let it show
Christmas magic let it grow
In Christmas harmony we find
Joy and peace for all men mankind
Sing together hearts entwined
In this season love's defined
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Through the cold and through the storm
In our hearts we keep it warm
With each carol let it show
Christmas magic let it grow
