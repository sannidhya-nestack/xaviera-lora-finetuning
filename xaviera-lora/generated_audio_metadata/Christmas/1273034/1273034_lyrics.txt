Trestles grow and shadows dance
In this season we take a chance
Every corner filled with cheer
Bringing warmth as the night draws near
Wreaths and ribbons, colors bright
Joined together on this night
Festive lights and love abound
In every heart joy can be found
Hold my hand let spirit soar
This magic's what we've waited for
Songs are playing, echoes sweep
Every moment feels complete
Snowflakes falling, dreams take flight
With you here it feels so right
Wreaths and ribbons colors bright
Joined together on this night
Festive lights and love all bound
In every heart joy can be found
Hold my hand let spirits soar
This magic's what we've waited for
Through the laughter, through the tears
We'll cherish all our hopes and fears
Every hug, a promise made
And this love will never fade
Fast invites and love abound
In every heart joy can be found
Hold my hand let spirit soar
This magic's what we've waited for
