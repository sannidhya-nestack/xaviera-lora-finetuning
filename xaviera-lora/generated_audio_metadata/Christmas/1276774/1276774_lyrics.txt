Underneath the sky's clear, snowflakes dancing night to night
Polar station magic near, reindeer prance with pure delight
Waiting here with frosted cheer, Santa's sleigh in red-green hue
Hoping soon that he'll appear, sparkling lights come into view
Razors glide on silver beams, glimpse of Santa's laughing eyes
Candy canes and snowy dreams, lifting spirits to the skies
In the glow of star-touched snow, antlers twinkle in the night
Santa's suit, a scarlet show, gleaming bright in velvet light
Harmony, a jingle sound, hearts beat with a festive thrill
Polar station, joy abound, winter won't rechase the chill
Rangers glide on silver beams, glimpse of Santa's laughing eyes
Candy canes and snowy dreams, lifting spirits to the skies
Rangers glide on silver beams, glint substantial laughing eyes
Candy canes and snowy dreams, lifting spirits to the skies
