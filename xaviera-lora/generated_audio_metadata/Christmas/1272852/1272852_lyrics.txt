I wanna turn around and head on back to a time before
We both lost track of the things we know are right and true
And when we get to our journey's end
And we're back where we both began
May you look in these eyes of mine
And finally see Christmas for the first time
For the first time
For the first time
For the first time
I've got a four-wheel drive we can use for a sleigh
To deliver the gifts on Christmas day
Well, I'll even do my best to fake
That I don't hate your mom's fruitcake
And when we get to our journey's end
And we're back where we both began
May you look in these eyes of mine
And finally see Christmas for the first time
For the first time
For the first time
For the first time
I've learned no well
Ain't just a word in a song
And you know very well
With me is where you belong
And when we get to our journey's end
And we're back where we both began
May you look in these eyes of mine
And finally see Christmas for the first time
It feels like the first time
For the first time, for the first time
Christmas for the first time
