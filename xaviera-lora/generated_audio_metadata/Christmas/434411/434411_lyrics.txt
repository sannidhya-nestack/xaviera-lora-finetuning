There is a pain deep in my heart
End of the year now we're apart
I love you all
There is no gift that can replace my only dream
To have you stay, I need you always
You said it would be forever
How we'd always stay together
Tell me how to make it right
If I wish (On the snow that falls down like my tears)
If I wish (On a star you'd be holding me near)
If I wish
Now the season of wishes is here
I'll make it happen in a Christmas wish
I miss the things we'd talk about
Close by the fire
Keep the cold out
You have
You said it would last a lifetime
And how you would always be mine
Tell me why it all went wrong
If I wish
On the snow that falls down like my tears
If I wish
On a star you behold in me, me
If I wish
Now the season of wishes is here
I'll make it happen in a Christmas way
Wish on the snow that falls down like my tears
Wish on a star you'd be here
Wish on the snow that falls down like my tears
Season of wishes is here
Oh yeah yeah
You said it would be forever (forever)
But we'd always stay together (stay)
Tell me how to make it right (if I wish)
All the snow that falls down like my tears (if I wish)
On a star you'd be holding me near
If I wish
Another season of wishes is here
I'll make it happen in a Christmas wind
On the snow that falls down like my tears
If I wish
On a star you'd be holding me near
Now the season of wishes is here
I'll make it happen in a Christmas wish
On the snow that falls down like my tears
On a star you behold in the evening
Now the season of wishes is here
Make it happen in a Christmas wish
