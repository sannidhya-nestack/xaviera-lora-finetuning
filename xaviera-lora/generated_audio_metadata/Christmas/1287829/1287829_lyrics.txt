Snowflakes, fall lights are glowing the night
Windows, frosted presents wrapped tight
Silent streets, hearts beating fast
Love in the time of Christmas will last
Mistletoe hung above our heads
Whispers linger soft like threads
Fires crackling, faces near
Our love grows, exudes no fear
Underneath the starry sky
Kisses sweet, never dry
Hold my hand in this winter's chill
Together forever our hearts will thrill
Yeah, carols sung by strangers in the street
Echoes of joy as our hearts meet
Candles lit, the warmth they share
Love in our eyes beyond compare
Snowmen built with scarves so bright
Laughter echoes deep in the night
Gifts exchanged, arms wrapped in cheer
Christmas love so sincere
Underneath the starry sky
Kisses sweet, never dry
Hold my hand in this winter's chill
Together forever our hearts will thrill
