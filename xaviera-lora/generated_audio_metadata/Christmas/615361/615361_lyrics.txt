Up on the housetop, reindeer paws
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones Christmas joys
Ho, ho, ho, who wouldn't go
Ho, ho, ho, who wouldn't go
Up on the housetop, click, click, click
Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick
First comes a stocking of little Nell
Oh dear Santa, fill it well
Give her a dolly that laughs and cries
One that'll open and shut her eyes
Ho, ho, ho, who wouldn't go
Ho, ho, ho, who wouldn't go
Up on the housetop click, click, click
Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick
Next comes a stocking of little will
Oh, just see what a glorious fill
Here is a hammer with lots of tacks
Also a ball and a whip that cracks
Ho, ho, ho, who wouldn't go?
Ho, ho, ho, who wouldn't go up on the housetop
Click, click, click
Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick
Down through the chimney with good Satanic
