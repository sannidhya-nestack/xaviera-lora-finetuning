Black leather boots up to his knees
Big steel buckle at his waist
A little bit strange doing his own thing
Has a long white beard'cause he just won't shake
Santa was the first punk rocker
Santa was the first punk rocker
Santa was the first
Santa was the first punk rocker
He was a homeless child in his hometown
He never could seem to fit in
The police didn't want him around
Cause he wouldn't conform (hey)
He wouldn't conform (hey)
Santa Claus just would not conform
Santa was the first punk rocker
Santa was the first punk rocker
Santa was the first
Santa was the first punk rocker
The crowd he's hanging with are as strange as they can be
Flying Ranger and little people dressed in green
He's a rebel against society
he won't take part in our hate and greed
He shares all he has like a giving treat
He's a jolly old-advocate for love and peace
Santa was the first punk rocker
Santa was the first punk rocker
Santa was the first
Santa was the first punk rocker
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na, Santa was the first punk rocker
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na, Santa was the first punk rocker
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na, Santa was the first (hey)
Santa was the first (hey)
Santa was the first punk rocker
