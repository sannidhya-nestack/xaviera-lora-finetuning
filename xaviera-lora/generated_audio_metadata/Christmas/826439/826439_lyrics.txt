Winter wonderland is here
The streets are paved in glacial dreams
The atmosphere is full of life
There's something magical
Insight and anything is possible when I am dreaming here with you
We will walk these enchanted streets together in a winter wonderland
And the night comes alive in the moonlight
And I come alive in your eyes
You pull me in and hold me close
The snowflakes nip your frosted nose
We'll dance along the streets of white
Our footprints ever dance
Delight in anything is possible when I am dancing here with you
Here with you
We will walk these enchanted streets together in a winter wonderland
And the night comes alive in the moonlight
And I come alive in your eyes
In your eyes
In a winter wonderland
The world will fade away
In a winter wonderland
The world will fade away
And the night comes alive
In the moonlight
And I come alive in your eyes
Winter wonderland, winter wonderland
Winter wonderland, winter wonderland
