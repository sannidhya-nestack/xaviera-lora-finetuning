It's that cold night, the stars are light
You shine so brightly like an angel
The snow is falling in the moonlight
But you're here with me
Angels singing high in the sky
Hear them whisper joy tonight
All that glitters in your eyes
Makes this world feel so bright
In snowfall we take our time
Your arm around me
It's the right one
The night's still young
Let this chime and you'll hear
Angels singing high in the sky
Hear them whisper joy tonight
All that glitters in your eyes
Makes this world feel alive
Stars like diamonds shine so true
There's magic in our hearts anew
Christmas warmth wrapping me in you
This moment the dreams come true
Angels singing high to the sky
Hear them whisper joy tonight
All that glitters in your eyes
Makes this world feel so bright
