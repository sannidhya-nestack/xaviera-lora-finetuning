Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow, on one horse open sleigh
On the fields we go, laughing all the way
Jingle bells, bells on both their rings
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, sing jingle bells, jingle all the way
What fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, two jingle bells, jingle all the way
One would find in a certain ride, one knows something's lame
A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And something's found me bright
You're sitting by my side
The ocean's leaving land
Fortune's in my slot
I got into a cryptic band
We were kind of soft
When I see jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, it's fine, it's alright, it won't know someone's name
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, it's fine, it's alright, it won't know someone's name
