Don't give enough, so bright lights sway
Snow falls, still you watch the jazz cats play
Rhythms tapping like the reindeer's hooves
Lip-sensing, drawing a winter groove
Candy canes hang stocking the line
Each note captures that holiday shine
Frosty windows with a cozy glow
To the beat of the falling snow
So let's mix up the Christmas cheer
With a smooth beat that's oh so clear
Jingle bells and a retro vibe
Feel the love fly in every scry
Old time records spin with a crackle
The little elves join the swing battle
Santa's way right through the sky
Jazz beats take us way up high
Twinkling lights on the city streets
Every corner jumps to swing beats
Snowflakes twirl in the evening light
Electro swing makes the season bright
So let's mix up the Christmas cheer
With this new beat that's oh so clear
Jingle bells and a retro vibe
Feel the lo-fi in every scribe
So let's mix up the Christmas cheer with this little beat that's oh so clear
Jingle bells and a retro vibe, feel the lo-fi in every scribe
