Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Snow falls softly, whispers in the air
Lights are glowing, love is everywhere
Footsteps crunching, a rhythm so rare
What a beautiful white Christmas, oh
What a dream, so timeless
The world wrapped in a velvet stillness
Windows frosted, patterns like lace
Candles flicker, warm every face
Time slows down in the sacred space
Breathe it in, the magic tonight
Hold it close, the stars are bright
What a beautiful white Christmas, oh
What a dream, so timeless
The world wrapped in a velvet stillness
Memories like snowflakes
They drift and dance
Moments frozen, a fleeting romance
Under the glow, we take our chance
