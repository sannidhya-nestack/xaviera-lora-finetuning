Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child, Holy infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace.
In heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream
Sing from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ our Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord of Thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Silent night, holy night
Sleep
