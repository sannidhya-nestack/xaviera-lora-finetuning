Christmas lights, twinkling magic in a frosty night
Every moment with you feels so right
Snowflakes dancing in the silent sky
Christmas cheer, doesn't it feel like we're the only ones
Wrapped in love'til the morning comes
Christmas needs
Celebrating with you
All these dreams
Coming true
Mistletoe
Sharing secrets in a fire-sized globe
Whisper wishes of the world will know
Hand in hand on the stars will go
Holding tight
With every hug we melt the ice
You and me in this paradise
Christmas Eve
Celebrating with you
All these dreams
Coming true
Mistletoe, sharing secrets in a fireside glow
Whispered wishes of the world we'll know
Hand in hand under stars we'll go
Holding tight, with every hug we met with the eye
You and me in this paradise
Christmas means celebrating with you
All these dreams coming true
In your arms I find my peace
Every moment a tender release
With you beside my heart's at ease
Love grows stronger never ceases
Christmas leaves (Christmas leaves)
Celebrating with you
All these dreams coming true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
