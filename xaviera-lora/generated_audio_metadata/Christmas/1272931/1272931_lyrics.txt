Curious trees dressed in coats of white
Silent whispers on this night
Snowflakes dance, a soft ballet
Magic moments here stay
Cocoa steam and laughter rings
Hearts are full of joyful things
Winter wonderland, dreams tonight
Sparkling stars and pure delight
Hold me close, let's make a vow
In this moment, here and now
Courage rides the streets of gold
Feeling in love with every flow
Hands entwined, our spirits soar
Every second, wanting more
Cocoa scene and laughter rings
Hearts are full of joyful things
Went to wonderland, dreams tonight
Sparkling stars and pure delight
Hold me close, let's make a vow
In this moment, here and now
All underneath the mistletoe
Kisses shared, like feelings glowed
Together we'll embrace the night
Chasing dreams in soft moonlight
Into wonderland, dreams tonight
Sparkling stars and pure delight
Hold me close, let's make a vow
In this moment, here and now
Underneath the mistletoe
Kisses share, let feelings grow
Together we'll embrace the night
Chasing dreams in soft moonlight
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
