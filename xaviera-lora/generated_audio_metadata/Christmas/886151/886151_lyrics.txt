The holly and the ivy
When they are both full grown
Of all the trees that are in the wood
The holly bears the crown
The holly bears a blossom
As white as lily flower
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
To be our sweet Saviour
Oh, the rising of the sun and the running of the deer
The playing of the merry an, singing of the choir
The holly bears are very as red as any blood
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to do poor sinners good
The holly bears a prickle
As sharp as any thorn
And merry boy sweet Jesus Christ
On Christmas day in the morn
Oh the rising of the sun
And the running of a deer
The playing of merry ans sweet
Singing of the choir
Oh, the rising of the sun
And the running of the deer
The playing of merry ans
The singing of the clown
The hollering and the ivy
Now both are full well grown
Oh all the trees that are in the wood
The holly bears the crown
Ooh
