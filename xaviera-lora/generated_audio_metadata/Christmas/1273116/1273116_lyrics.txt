Crimson ribbons, gifts in tow
Fireplace with a gentle glow
Carols sung by candlelight
Magic fills this wondrous night
Every heart is feeling light
In the glow of festive light
Warm our wishes and cheer tonight
Love and joy in every sight
Let's embrace the season song in our hearts where we belong
Frosty windows, stars so clear
Echoes of a joyful year
Loved ones gathered, laughter sweet
Making memories so comfy
Every heart is feeling light
In the glow of festive light
Warm with wishes and cheer tonight
Love and joy in every sight
Let's embrace the season song
In our hearts where we belong
As we stand beneath the tree
Filled with love and harmony
Every smile and every kiss
Wraps us in pure Christmas bliss
Warm we wishes and cheer tonight
Love and joy in every sight
Let's embrace the season song
In our hearts where we belong
May the spirit last all year
Spreading warmth and heartache yeah
