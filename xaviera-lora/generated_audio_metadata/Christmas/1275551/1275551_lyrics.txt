Frosted branches silver glow
Twinkling lights on streets below
Moonlit paths where angels sing
Hearts alight with everything
In the hush of winter's breeze
Magic whispers through the trees
Enchanted Christmas Eve, pure and bright
Fill our hearts with love tonight
Stars above, the world in peace
In this moment joy is really
Coco wants the cozy cheer
Loved ones gathering so near
Songs of old and tales of new
Christmas wonder me and you
In the hush of winter's breeze
Magic whispers through the tree
Enchanted Christmas seems pure and bright
Fill our hearts with love tonight
Stars above, the world in peace
In this moment, your days will really
Coco wants a cozy cheer
Loved ones gathering so near
Songs of old and tales of new
Christmas wonder me and you
In the hush of winter's breeze
Magic whispers through the trees
Enchanted Christmas Eve, pure and bright
Fill our hearts with love tonight
Stars above, the world in peace
In this moment, joy is relieved
Underneath the starry sky
Dreams are born and hopes fly high
In your arms I find my place
In this night's soft embrace
Enchanted Christmas Eve, pure and bright
Fill our hearts with love tonight
Stars above, the world in peace
In this moment joy is relieved
