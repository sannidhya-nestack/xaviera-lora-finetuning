Jolly Santa red and white
Coming through the snowy night
Stockings hung, trees with lights
Oh, beautiful Christmas sight
Twinkle, twinkle, Christmas star
Shining brightly from afar
Gifts and joy near and far
That's how wonderful you are
Candy canes and cookies, sweet Christmas really is a treat
Rudolph with his nose so bright, guards and a sleigh through the night
Twinkle, twinkle, Christmas star
Shining brightly from afar
Gifts and joy near and far
That's how wonderful you are
Sleepy eyes, it's time for bed
Dreams of Christmas dance in our head
Santa's visit, oh so right
Wish you all a merry Christmas and a nice night
Here comes Santa, oh so jolly in his sleigh
Pulled by holly gifts for all big and small
Christmas time is best of all
Look at the tree, shining bright
Stars and tinsel, sparkling light
Cookies and milk, set just right
For Santa Claus this silent night
Here comes Santa, oh so jolly in his sleigh
Pulled by holly, gifts for all
Big and small, Christmas time is best of all
Look at the tree, shining bright
Dream zooms of toys dance in our head
When we awake what will we find
Gifts that Santa left behind
Early morning such a sight
Packages wrapped up tight
Oh what joy Christmas brings
To good little girls and kids
