There's a house high on a ridge
Where a family used to live
I called it home
Once upon a Christmas
My folks don't live there anymore
By now they've passed through heaven's door
But I recall them every once upon a Christmas
Out on the ice, we'd try to make figure eights with our skates
We'd go sledding down the bend, all the fun we had back then
As I decorate my tree
I relive those memories
They take me back
To once upon a Christmas
All the nights we drove around
To see the lights in our hometown
Last time I felt this way was once upon a Christmas
I've moved on in life and yet
There's no way I can et
The ones I loved
Once upon a Christmas
Every night I kneel and pray
To see them all again someday
And celebrate
Once upon a Christmas, just like we were
Once upon a Christmas
