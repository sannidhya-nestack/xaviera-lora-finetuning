Hiding trees whisper secrets old
Stars like silver bright and bold
Smoke from chimneys curls up high
Through the velvet country sky
Out here where the wild things know
But Christmas comes on feet of snow
Barn owls watch the midnight clear
While forest creatures gather near
To share in Christmas cheers
Lantern light through cabin glass
Deer prints in the mountain pass
Quilts and cookies wood stacked high
As winter whispers lullaby
Out here where the wild things know
Christmas comes on feet of snow
Barn owls watch the midnight clear
Wild forest creatures gather near
To share in Christmas cheer
Nature's got her party dress
Everything in white you'll bless
Mountain peaks and valley floors
As Christmas magic opens doors
Out here where the wild things know
Christmas comes on feet of snow
Barn owls watch the midnight clear
While forest creatures gather near
To share in Christmas cheer
