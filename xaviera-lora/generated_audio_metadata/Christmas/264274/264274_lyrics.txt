Old man winter is in town tonight
Snowflakes like gems turn everything white
Candy canes Rudolph wreaths on the doors
To me Christmas is something more
Shoppers filled streets with holiday cheer
Children tried hard to be good all year
Reading their wish lists on Santa's knee
That's just not Christmas to me
Now I love holly, tinsel, and bows
Carols, sleigh rides, and mistletoe
But the one gift I want won't be under the tree
you are Christmas to me
Hang stockings and lights, trim windows with pie
There's gingerbread men, roast turkey and wine
Cookies and eggnog, fresh apple pie
But Christmas isn't something you buy
Just us alone, a yuletide log on the fire
A quiet dinner for two
Side by side as the embers burn down
It can't be Christmas without you
Now I love holy tinsel and bows
Carols, sleigh rides and mistletoe
But the one gift I want isn't under the tree
you are Christmas to me
You make the season all it can be
You are Christmas to me
