It's cold outside, ooh-ooh
A typical December night
We sit around the fire
Freezing, getting tired
It doesn't really matter
When you're here with me
It doesn't really matter
When you're here with me, ooh-ooh
Here with me
Forever Christmas it should be
I feel the joy inside of me
The love of Christmas in my heart
Will stay and never break apart
Forever Christmas it should be
We're spending all day, ooh-ooh
Sitting here dreaming away
Love is in the air, feel it everywhere
It doesn't really matter when you're here with me
It doesn't really matter
When you're here with me
Ooh, here with me
Forever Christmas it should be
I feel the joy inside of me
The love of Christmas in my heart
We stay and never break apart
Forever Christmas it should be
It's cold outside (cold outside) a typical December night (December night)
I feel in love with you, a Christmas night for two
And it doesn't really matter
That I'm feeling cold
It doesn't really matter
it's me you hold
Forever Christmas it should be
I feel the joy inside of me
The love of Christmas in my heart
Will stay and never break apart
Forever Christmas it should be
I feel the joy inside of me
The love of Christmas in my heart
Will stay and never break apart
Forever Christmas it should be, oh
Forever Christmas it should be
It's going outside (going outside)
It's going outside, ooh-ooh
It's going outside (for real, for real, for Christmas)
It's going outside, ooh-ooh (for real, for real, for Christmas)
