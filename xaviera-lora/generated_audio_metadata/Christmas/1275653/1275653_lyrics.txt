The days stretch out slow and sweet
I count the hours, far from everything
The lights shine in the distance
But your smile, well I miss it so
I while away the time gently
Dreaming of you and the moment
When your steps will find the way
To my heart, yes I wait
The fir trees dance under the wind
The garlands glow a touch of white
But without you all seems grey
I wait for Christmas lost in time
I'll while away the time gently
Dreaming of you and the moment
When your steps will find a way
To my heart, yes I'll wait
The bells will soon start to ring
But I still prefer the words
Of your intoxicating promises
That will make my night so bright
I'll while away the time gently
Dreaming of you and the moment
When your steps will find the way
To my heart, yes I'll wait
I'll while away the time gently
Dreaming of you and the moment
When your steps will find the way
To my heart, yes I'll wait
