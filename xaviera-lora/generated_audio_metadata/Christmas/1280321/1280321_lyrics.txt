School bus tracks in morning white
Made the first path through the night
Teacher cancelled class today
Now all the children run to play
First Christmas snow of December
Making memories to remember
Building snowmen ten feet tall
Catching flakes before they fall
On this perfect winter day
Yellow scarves and mismatched gloves
Snowball fights and turtle doves
Hot chocolate steam fills the air
While dogs and children run and tear
First Christmas snow of December
Making memories to remember
Building snowmen ten feet tall
Catching flakes before they fall
On this perfect winter day
The world stops spinning for a while
As nature paints and curdled doves
Hot chocolate steam fills the air
While dogs and children run and tear
First Christmas snow of December
Making memories to remember
Building snowmen ten feet tall
Catching flakes before they fall
On this perfect winter day
Yellow scarves and mismatched gloves
Snowball fights and turtle doves
Hot chocolate steam fills the air
While dogs and children run and tear
Yellow scarves and mismatched gloves
Snowball fights and turtle doves
Hot chocolate steam fills the air
While dogs and children run and tear
While dogs and children run and tear
The world stopped spinning for a while
As nature paints in curdled doves
Each moment precious as can be
Like ornaments on Christmas trees
First Christmas snow of December
Making memories to remember
Building snowmen ten feet tall
Catching flakes before they fall
On this perfect winter day
First Christmas snow of December
Making memories to remember
Building snowmen ten feet tall
Catching flakes before they fall
On this perfect winter day
