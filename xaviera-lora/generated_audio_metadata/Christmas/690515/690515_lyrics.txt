Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Dashing through the snow
In the one horse open sleigh
Through the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on both tails ring
Ooh, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight, oh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Now the ground is white
Oh, go with while you're young
Take the girls tonight
And sing this swaying song
Just get up up'til day
Two forty forty
Then hitch into an open sleigh and crack you'll take the lead
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, a jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells, a jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, one-horse open sleigh
