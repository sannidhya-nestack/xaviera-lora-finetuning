Silent night, holy night
All is calm
All is bright
Round yon virgin
Mother and child
Holy infant
So tender and mild
Sleep (in heavenly peace)
Miracles do happen (this is a wonderful world)
Sleep (in heavenly peace)
I believe, I believe
On this holy night
Be still my soul
Be still my soul
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep
Silent night
Holy night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from
Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Sleep, in heavenly peace
Miracles do happen
My soul can heavenly be
I believe, I believe
On this holy night, be still my soul
Sleep in heavenly peace
