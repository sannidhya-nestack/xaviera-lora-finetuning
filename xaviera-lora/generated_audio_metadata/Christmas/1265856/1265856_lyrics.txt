Under mistlet moonlight gleaming
Winter whispers feels like dreaming
Beside you it all seems right
Snow is falling stars are glowing
Cuddle closer hearts are showing
Christmas magic in the night
Need to celebrate Christmas
With you both, my dearest love
Wrapped in holiday cheer
With you my darling near
Fire crackles warm surround us
In your arms is all a plus
This season all my dreams came true
Holly lights we're keeping close
Gift of love no need to boast
Every wish fulfilled with you
Need to celebrate Christmas with you close my dearest love
Wrapped in holiday cheer with you my darling near
Wind winds may blow but in your arms I know
The world feels warmer glow
With every kiss my love starts to show
Snowflakes dance around
But with you I'm found
We celebrate Christmas
With you close my dearest love
Wrapped in holiday cheer
With you my darling dear
