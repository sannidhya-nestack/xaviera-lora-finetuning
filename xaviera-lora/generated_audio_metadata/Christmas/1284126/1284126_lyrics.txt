Snowflakes fall on Silent Night
Stars above are shining bright
Lights they twinkle people cheer
Christmas time is drawing near
In a sleigh with magic gear
Santa flies without a fear
Gifts and joy he brings around
Silent Night's the only sound
Away with Santa through the sky
Hold on tight and don't ask why
Magic's real just close your eyes
Feel the wonder, see the skies
By the fire warmth and gleam
Lost in Christmas dream
Whispers soft of holiday
Hearts and minds they drift away
Underneath the mistletoe
Candles lit they softly glow
Love surrounds us tender night
All is calm and all is bright
Away with Santa through the sky
Hold on tight and don't ask why
Magic's real just close your eyes
Feel the wonder see the sky
La, la, la, la, away with Santa through the sky
La, la, la, la, la, away with Santa through the sky
Hold on tight and don't ask why
Magic's real just close your eyes
Feel the wonder, see the skies
