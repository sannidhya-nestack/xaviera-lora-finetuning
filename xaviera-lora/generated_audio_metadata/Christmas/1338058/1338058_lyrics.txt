Flashing lights on a neon street
Bouncin' boots to the jingle beat
Got that rhythm in my soul tonight
Snowflakes shimmerin' under city lights
Candy canes spinnin', sleighs on the go
Pocket full of gin, ready to flow
Turn up the bass, slide to the floor
Jingle bell jam
Give me some more
Hear that sound, it's ringing through
Frunky little reindeer bustin' a move
Raise your hands, let the world know
Jingle bells, we're ready to roll
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Jingle all the way
We're gonna fly
Movin' in the moonlight, sleighs in the sky
Funky funky bells, don't you stop
Shakin' up the season, let the good vibes drop
Jingle all the way, come dance with me
Spinnin' around the tree in perfect harmony
Funky funky bells, bring the holiday heat
Everybody on your feet
Feel that Christmas beat
Oh, yeah
Hey yeah
Trendy boots and a velvet hat
Santa struts in feeling all that
Tambourines jingling delight
Coolest North Pole party tonight
Stockings swing to a syncopated groove
Socks and slippers getting the move
Gift wrap crackles
Spirits ignite funked up Christmas
Shining bright
Hear that sound, it's ringing through
Funky little reindeer bus on the move
Raise your hands, let the world know
Jingle bells, we're ready to roll
Jingle all the way, we're gonna fly
Groovin' in the moonlight, slice in the sky
Funky funky bells, don't you stop
Shakin' up the season, let the good vibes drop
Jingle all the way, come dance with me
Spin around the tree in perfect harmony
Funky funky bells, bring a holiday heat
Everybody on your feet, feel that Christmas beat
Let the horns play, let the chorus sing
Jingle bells boogie, let that rhythm ring
Glow in your smile
Joy by the ton
Funky Christmas magic come on everyone
Jingle all the way through the funk and snow
Holiday fire, we'll never let go
Funky funky bells, oh what cheer
Dancing with love this time of year
