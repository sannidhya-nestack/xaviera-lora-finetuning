Bling, bling, bling-o-bounce
Fill my heart with joy
Diamond rings and fancy things, I love my big girl toys
I should get my warm and fuzzies from the memories that we make
But I'm all about the bling, bling, bling, bling all the way
Used to be the caroling that gave me Christmas cheer
Trimming trees with popcorn strings and holding loved ones near
Giving unto others, grandmas, pumpkin pies and such
You still should be enough for me but lately not so much
Yeah only bling, bling, bling-o bells fill my heart with joy
Diamond rings and fancy things, I love my big girl toys
I should get my warm and fuzzies from the memories that we make
But I'm all about the bling, bling, bling, bling all the way
I'm all wrapped up and sparkly stuffed with fourteen carat shine
The warm embrace of glittered lace gets me every time
No need to stay up late to hear the sound of reindeer paws
'Cause I can wake up to my sugar daddy's Santa Claus, Santa Claus
He brings me bling, bling, blingle bells
To fill my heart with joy
Diamond rings and fancy things
I love my big girl toys
I sure get my warm and fuzzies from
The memories that we make
But I'm all about the bling, bling, bling
Blingo all the way
Yeah, I'm all about the bling, bling bling
Blingo all the way
I'm all about the bling bling bling
I wanna go all the way
