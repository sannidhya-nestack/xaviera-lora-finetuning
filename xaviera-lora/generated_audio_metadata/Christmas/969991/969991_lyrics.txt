I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men
I thought how as the day had come
The bell-frees of all Christendom
Had rolled away the unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men
Mm-hmm
And in despair, I bow to my head
There is no peace on earth, I said
For hate is strong, it marks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men
Goodwill to man
Then feel the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead, nor does he sleep
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, good will to man
Good will to man
Good will to man
A good will to men
