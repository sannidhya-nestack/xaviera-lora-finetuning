Snow is falling, popping like corn
Lights are twinkling, your magic is born
Chilling by the chimney, heart keeps me warm
This festive fever's got me in a storm
Stacks of presents wrapped in a red bow
Underneath the mistletoe, lights with a glow
Giggling through the night, vibes that we show
Sharing cheer like a movie in slow-mo
Dancing with the candy cane, swinging to the beat
Jingle bells tapping, I can't feel my feet
Reindeer's flying, yep they're bringing that heat
The holiday spirit, man it can't be beat
Sipping cocoa with marshmallow delight
Stuck in time, tied by the firelight
Friends and laughter, it's such a sight
Feeling so alive under the starry night
Breeze so hanging every door we pass
Joyful melodies that fill the class
Catching snowflakes they don't need a pass
Holiday vibes straight from the looking glass
Dancing with the Kenny Kenny gang
Swinging through the beat
Jingle bells tapping I can't feel my feet
Radiance flying you're bringing the heat
The holiday spirit man it can't be beat
