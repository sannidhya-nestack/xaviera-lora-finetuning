Fires burning, crackling low
We're under the blankets
In the softly falling snow
It's a warm bright Christmas when I'm with you
You're my joy tonight
And my morning sunlight
Can't wait to kiss you
Beneath the mistletoe
The tree lights are shimmering bright
Hold me close to the night
The city's sparkling white
But here by the fireside
It's just right
He laughs a melody, sweet sound
Brings warmth to the cold night
As the snowflakes dance around
It's a peaceful Christmas with your love, Mir
You bring the cheer
And you chase away my fears
Beside this fire
There's nothing else I need
The tree lights are shimmering bright
Hold me close to tonight
The city's sparkling white
But here by the fireside
It's just dry
In your arms I find my way
You make the darkest night gay
Together we'll keep the chill at bay
With love warming everyday
The tree lights are shimmering bright
Hold me close to tonight
The city's sparkling white
But here by the fireside
It's just right
