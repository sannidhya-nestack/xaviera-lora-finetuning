Frosty air paints the window's face
Crackling fire whispers embrace
Twinkle lights on the tree they sway
In this low-fire world we stay
Snowflakes fall onto silent streets
Tiny footprints where memories meet
Gingerbread dreams fill the air
With every beat show we care
Silent night, lights out dim and low
In this quiet peace we grow
Without a word we understand
Feel the warmth of my hand
Candy canes on the windowsill
Old records spin round standing still
Humming songs of the inner glow
In this low fire world we stay
Snowflakes fall onto silent streets
Tiny footprints where memories meet
Gingerbread dreams fully there with every breath
Silent night, lights are dim and low
In this quiet peace we grow
Without a word we understand
Feel the warmth hold my hand
Candy canes on the windowsill
Old records spin round standing still
Humming songs softly in the glow
In this lo-fi Christmas flow
Hot cocoa swells in midnight cups
Cozy blankets we won't give up
Simple joys in the soothing haze
Countless stars in holiday maze
Silent night lights are dim and low
In this quiet peace we grow
Without a word we understand
Feel the warmth of my hand
