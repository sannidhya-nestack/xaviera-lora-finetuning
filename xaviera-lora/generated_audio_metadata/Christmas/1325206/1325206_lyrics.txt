Tonight's a special night
And we're here for you
Maybe now it's Christmas time again
And your stars will be shining bright on the horizon, yeah
This Christmas feel Christmas time
Become the love you want if you want the world to change
And these moments that you can't fight
When you keep peace in your heart
Love is not so very strange
Don't spend it by yourself
Please think about someone else as it's Christmas time my friends
Can we one day stop the fighting right on the dividing lines
This Christmas feel Christmas time
Become the love you want if you want the world to change
And these moments that you can't fight
When you keep peace in your heart
Love is not so very strange
This Christmas feel Christmas time
Become the love you want if you want the world to change
These moments that you can't find
When you keep peace in your heart love is not so very strange
