Christmas, Christmas time is here
A time so nice, you say it twice
Everybody's full of cheer
So warm and bright, smile
Why it makes me cry
I know I'll miss you every time
It's cold at night
The bed's too light
It's late and I can't close my eyes
So if it's not too late
Christmas go away
Last year we were hand in hand
Still best friends till the end
I thought it would last but then
You intended that awful thing
You made it so your body'd go
Down all the way, beneath the lake
Another year I say
Christmas don't be late
But now my mind has changed
Christmas go away
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Christmas go away
I don't wanna stay
Christmas go away
I don't wanna stay
Another year and say
Christmas don't be late
But now my mind has changed
Christmas go away
