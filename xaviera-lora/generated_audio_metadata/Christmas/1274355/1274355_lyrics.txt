Yeah, like the fire's gentle glow
Stories from long ago
Laughter mingles with the flame
In this house, love's the same
Silent night, soft and bright
Hot side warmth feels just right
Ooh ooh
Hot side at home and me pure and sweet
Where our hearts and memories meet
And in this glow we find our peace
Christmas joy will never cease
Evergreen with lights adorned
Echoes of the child reborn (the child reborn)
Stockings hung with care and pride
In this warmth we all abide
Silent night (silent night)
Soft and bright (soft and bright)
Heart's side warmth
Feels just right, ooh just right
Hearts sigh in harmony, pure and sweet
Where our hearts and memories meet
And in this glow we find our peace
Christmas joy will never cease
Underneath the mistletoe
Wiggles of the child reborn
Stockings hung with care and pride
In this warmth we find our peace
Christmas joy will never cease
Underneath the mistletoe
Whispers soft feelings show
Promises in candlelight
Binding us through this night
On silent halls
Harmony, pure and sweet (pure and sweet)
Fill our hearts and memories (memories)
In this glow we find our peace (we find our peace)
Christmas joy will never cease
Underneath the mistletoe
Is this our feelings show
Promises in candlelight
Binding us through this night
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Never cease
