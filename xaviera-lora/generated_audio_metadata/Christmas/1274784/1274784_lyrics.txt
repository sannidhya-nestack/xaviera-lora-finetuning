The stars we shout for the signal
The light warms every home
The bells are ringing we're singing loud
The joy of Christmas we carry it with us still
Christmas lives in us we laugh and smile
We want from each other that's all we give
Love spreads and reaches every corner
Together we create a Christmas so wonderful yeah
The scent of pine and mulled wine fills our house
The children's joy is heard in every step
Music and song blend with the light
Christmas is here and we feel its peace
Christmas lives in us, we laugh and smile
We've won from each other, that's all we give
Love spreads and reaches every corner
Together we create a Christmas so wonderful yet
Crescent of pineapple, wine fills our house
The children's joy is heard in every step
Music and song blend with the light
Christmas is here and we feel its peace
Christmas lives in us, we laugh and smile
With warmth from each other, that's all we give
Love spreads, it reaches every corner
Together we create a Christmas, so wonderful yeah
