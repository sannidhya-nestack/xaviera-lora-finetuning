I'm believing what I'm feeling
It's gonna last all winter long
My cup of cheer is soulful
And joyful heart is hopeful
And I just can't stop singing along to every song
I've been walking through eight worlds of wonder
Loving every part
Of the spell I'm under
Absolutely no doubt this will be
The Christmas of my dreams
Of my dreams
When we're dancing, slow snowman-cing
I'm hearing sleigh bells, oh baby can't you tell that
I've been walking through eight worlds of wonder, love
In every part of the spell I'm under
Absolutely no doubt this will be
The Christmas of my dreams
Of my dreams
I've been walking through a world of wonder
Loving every part of the spell I'm under
Absolutely no doubt this will be, no
I've been walking through
Hey, world, have a wonder
Love in every part
Of the spell I'm under
Absolutely no doubt this will be
No, absolutely no doubt this will be
The Christmas of my dreams
The Christmas of my dreams
The Christmas of my dreams
