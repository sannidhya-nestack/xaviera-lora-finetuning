I love, oh oh
I love, give
Silent snowfall graces ground
Hasteful whispers all around
Candlelight and windows glow
Gentle warmth and winter show
Stars above so pure and bright
Guide us through this holy night
Silence, no false serenade
In this moment love conveyed
Hearts are open, spirits high
Underneath the Christmas sky
Carols sung by fire's light
Voices blending sweet delight
Children's laughter soft and clear
Filling hearts with Christmas cheer
Stars above so pure and bright
Guide us through this holy night
Silent snowfall serenade
In this moment love conveyed
Hearts are open, spirits high
Underneath the Christmas sky
In the stillness dreams take flight
Wishes made on stars so bright
Hand in hand we celebrate
Bound by love we elevate
Silence, no false serenade
In this moment love conveyed
Hearts are open, spirits high
Underneath the Christmas sky
I alone, oh oh
I alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I love'em
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I love'em
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I love'em
Oh, oh, I'll, oh, oh, I'll
