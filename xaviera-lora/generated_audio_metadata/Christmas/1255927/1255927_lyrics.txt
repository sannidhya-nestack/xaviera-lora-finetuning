Lingle below in the night
Christmas stars oh so bright
Santa's coming oh what a sight
Christmas is here oh what do you like
See the tree all shiny and tall
Gifts beneath for one and all
Sweet cookies baked in the hall
Christmas time we have a ball
Jingle jingle in the snow
To the North Santa must go
His reindeer fast, never slow
Ho, ho, ho, he calls out in a row
Stockings hung by the fire
Love and joy never tire
Listen to the Christmas choir
Singing carols takes you higher
Jingle, jingle, bells ring cheer
Love and hope so clear
Christmas time is here
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
See the tree, all shiny and tall
Gifts beneath for one and all
Sweet cookies baked in the hall
Christmas time we have a ball
Jingle jingle in the snow
To the north Santa must go
His reindeer fast, never slow
Ho, ho, ho, he calls out in a row
Staglings hung by the fire
Love and joy never tire
Listen to the Christmas choir
Singing carols takes you higher
Singing carols takes you higher
