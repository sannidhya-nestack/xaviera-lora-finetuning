Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank and then we got upset
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Now the ground is white
Go wait while you're young
Take the girls tonight
And sing this slaying song
Just get a bobtail bait
Two forty at his speed
Hitch a to and up and slay
And crack you'll take the lead
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
All we're found is to ride in one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
All what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
All what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
