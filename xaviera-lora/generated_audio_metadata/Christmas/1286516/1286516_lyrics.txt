Snowfakes fall on the midnight ground
Streetlights glow, no one's around
Whispers echo in the frosty air
Silent night without a care
Silver bells they gently chime
Peaceful moments frozen time
Under stars where dreams unfold
Warming hearts when nights are cold
Cuddled close by the fly side flame
Softly sharing sweet holiday names
Laughter as light fills the empty streets
Soft snow blankets the city's peace
Silver does they gently chime
Peaceful moments frozen in time
Under stars where dreams unfold
Warming hearts when nights are cold
Carols hum with a sleepy tune
Magic flow beneath the moon
Silent whispers in the air
Holidays are everywhere
Silver bells they gently chime
Peaceful moments frozen in time
Under stars where dreams unfold
Warm in hearts when nights are cold
