Snow is falling, crisp and clear
Chilly winds, the seasons here
Horses trotting through the glade
Whispers of the love we've made
Hot cider warming in our hands
Building dreams with winter's plans as plans
Sleigh rides in for me tonight
Music echoing, hearts in flight
Hold on tight, let's drift away
In this moment we will stay
Fire crack and shadows play
Telling stories come what may
Every glance a spark ignites
Underneath the starry nights
Hot cider warming in our hands
Building dreams with winter's plans, those plans
Sleigh rides in for me tonight
Music echoing, hearts in flight
Hold on tight, let's drift away
In this moment we will stay, oh
Wrap your arms around me tight
Feel the warmth of pure delight
As we glide the snowy lanes
In our hearts the love remains
Sleigh rides in for me tonight
Music echoing hearts in flight
Hold on tight like stretched away
In this moment we will stay
Oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Wrap your arms around me tight
Feel the warmth of pure delight
As we glide through snowy lanes
In our hearts the love remains
Hot cider warming in our hands
Building dreams with winter's plans as plans
Oh, oh, oh
But we will stay
Oh, oh, this moment we will stay
