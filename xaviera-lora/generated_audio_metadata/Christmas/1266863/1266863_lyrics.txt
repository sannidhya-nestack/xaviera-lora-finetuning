The lights on the tree shine bright with cheer
Snowflakes fall in slow, it's that time of year
Let me enjoy, feel the warmth we share
In a Christmas wonder, in a Christmas wonder
In a Christmas wonder, in a Christmas wonder
In a Christmas wonder
Hear the bells ring out in every song
The magic's everywhere, let's sing along
Sharing these moments with the ones we love
In a Christmas wonder, in a Christmas wonder
In a Christmas wonder, in a Christmas wonder
In a Christmas wonder
Hold these memories tight
In the glow of night
Christmas feels so right
Together we shine bright
In a Christmas wonder
In a Christmas wonder
In a Christmas wonder
In a Christmas wonder
