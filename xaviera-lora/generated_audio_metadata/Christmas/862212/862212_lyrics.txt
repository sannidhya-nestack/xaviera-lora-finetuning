Mistletoe and silver trees
Strings of lights that line the streets
It's snowing down on our town
I remember
Wreaths are hung on city lights
Families strolling through the night
And bells will ring while people sing
I remember
Christmas in my town
I go there each year
If only in my heart
It keeps my family near
Stockings hung with tender care
Love and joy fill the air
I see Santa Claus, I know it was
I remember
Mom and dad excited to
Wake us up to all that's new
Gifts under the tree, rich ones for me
I remember Christmas in my town
I go there each year
If only in my heart
It keeps my family near
Christ was born on Christmas day
To bring us peace on earth we pray
That's what it's about
That's what it's about
Remember
Oh Christmas in my town
I go there each year
If only in my heart it keeps my family near
