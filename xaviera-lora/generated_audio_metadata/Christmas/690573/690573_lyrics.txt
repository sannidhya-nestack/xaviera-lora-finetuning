Sing we now of Christmas, Noel's in the air
Sing our grateful praises to the mates for dear
Sing
And give more Noel
Sing we now of Christmas
Singing Noel
Singing Noel
From the eastern kingdoms come the wise men far
Bearing ancient treasure following on the star
Sing we Noel, the King is born Noel
Sing we now of Christmas, sing we hear Noel
From the distant mountains, hear the trumpet sound
With angelic blessings on the silent town
Sing we Noel, the King is born Noel
Sing we now of Christmas, sing we hear Noel
Sing ah, Noel, Noel
Sing ah
Noel
Sing we now of Christmas
Noel, sing we here
Sing our grateful praises
To the mates, your dear
Sing we Noel
Give you more Noel
Sing we now of Christmas
Sing we here Noel
Sing we here Noel
Sing we here Noel
Come let us surround him on this magic night
Gather here around him wonders babe of light
Sing we Noel
The King is born Noel
Sing we now of Christmas
Sing we Noel
Oh sing now of Christmas
Sing our grateful praises to the maid so dear
Sing we Noel, the King is born Noel
Sing we now of Christmas, sing we hear Noel
Sing of Noel
Noel, sing, ah, sing, Noel
