Hey, hey, hey, Santa buddy
Man it's Christmas Eve and hey Santa buddy
Man I still believe in mistletoe
And the ruby red glow of Rudolph leading your sleigh
Hey, hey, hey, Santa buddy
Can I bend your hand hey Santa buddy
What you got in there in that sack for me and my baby
For Christmas, Christmas day
We got a yule log on the fire
We got eggnog chillin' on ice
My baby's plunkin' on a Christmas stacket
They were a little bit naughty but oh so nice, hey, hey
Santa buddy, I ain't always good but hey
Santa buddy, I still think you should cut me some slack
And I'll pay ya back by being a real good boy next year
That's a good deal, yeah
We got a human log on the fire
We got eggnog chillin' on ice
My baby's floating on her Christmas stockings
They were a little bit naughty but oh so nice hey hey
Santa buddy, please don't leave, come on
Santa buddy, man it's Christmas Eve
Cut me some slack and I'll pay you back
By being a real good boy next year
I'll be a real good boy next year
Hey, hey, hey

Hey, hey, hey, Santa body
Hey, hey, hey, Santa body
Hey, hey, hey
