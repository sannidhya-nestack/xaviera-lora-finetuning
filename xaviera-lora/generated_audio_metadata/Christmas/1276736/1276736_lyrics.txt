Snowflakes twirling, moonlit air
Softly landing everywhere
Holding hands, we walk the lane
Heartbeat sink low, sweet refrain
In this winter wonderland
Feel the magic hand in hand
Winter's love, a tender glow
In your eyes it starts to show
Underneath the star-reach skies
Christmas love that never dies
Mistletoe above our heads
Words of love so softly said
In your arms the world feels right
Warming hearts on this cold night
In this winter wonderland
Feel the magic hand in hand
Winter's love, a tender glow
In your eyes it starts to show
Underneath the star-reached skies
Christmas love that never dies
Candles flicker shadows play
In this moment here we'll stay
Whispers soft a kiss so sweet
Love's embrace our hearts complete
In this winter wonderland
Feel the magic hand in hand
Winter's love, a tender glow
In your eyes it starts to show
Underneath the star-reach skies
Christmas love that never dies
Candles flicker, shadows play
In this moment, here we'll stay
Whispers soft, a kiss so sweet
Love's embrace, our heart's complete
In this winter wonderland
Feel the magic hand in hand
Winter's love, a tender glow
In your eyes it starts to show
Underneath the starry skies
Christmas love that never dies
