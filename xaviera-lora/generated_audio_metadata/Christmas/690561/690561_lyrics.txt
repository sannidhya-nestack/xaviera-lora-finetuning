I saw three ships come sailing in on Christmas day, on Christmas day
I saw three ships come sailing in on Christmas day in the morning
And what was in those ships, all three, on Christmas day, on Christmas day
And what was in those ships, all three, on Christmas day in the morning
Mary, Myl, and Christ were there on Christmas day, on Christmas day
Mary, Myl, and Christ were there on Christmas day in the morning
And all the bells on earth did ring on Christmas day, on Christmas day
And all the bells on earth did ring on Christmas day in the morning
I saw three ships come sailing in on Christmas day, on Christmas day
I saw three ships come sailing in on Christmas day in the morning
What was in those ships all three on Christmas day, on Christmas day
And what was in those ships all three on Christmas day in the morning
And all the angels in heaven did sing on Christmas day, on Christmas day
And all the angels in heaven did sing on Christmas day in the morning
So let us all rejoice again on Christmas day, on Christmas day
And let us all rejoice again on Christmas day in the morning
I saw three ships come sailing in on Christmas day, on Christmas day
I saw three ships come sailing in on Christmas day in the morning
So let us all rejoice again on Christmas day, on Christmas day
So let us all rejoice again on Christmas day in the morning
Christmas day in the morning
Christmas day in the morning
