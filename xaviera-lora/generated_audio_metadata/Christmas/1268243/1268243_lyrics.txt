The snow is falling softly
The lights are shining bright
Every note of joy reminds me
Of you holding me tight
With every carol sung
I hear your voice in the sound
Christmas melodies fill my heart when you're around
Oh the magic of the season it all feels so true
But the greatest gift I'm given is the love I feel from you
In the warmth of your embrace I found
Christmas melodies fill my heart with you around
By the fire we are swaying to the songs of the night
You and me, our love glowing, everything feels so right
With each bell that rings, a harmony profound
Christmas melodies fill my heart when you're around
Oh, the magic of the season, it all feels so true
But the greatest gift I'm given is the love I feel from you
In the warmth of your embrace I've found
Christmas melodies fill my heart with you around
Through the snow and the cheer
I'll hold you ever near
With you beside me every Christmas feels new
All the songs we share
The love in the air
My heart sings only for you
Oh, the magic of the season, it all feels so true
But the greatest gift I'm given is the love I feel from you
In the warmth of your embrace I found
Christmas melodies fill my heart with you around
