Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey
Up on the housetop reindeer paws
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Yeah yeah yeah
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones
Christmas joys
Yeah yeah yeah
Here comes the stocking of little Nell
Oh dear Santa, fill it well
Give her a dolly that laughs and cries
One that can open and shut her eyes
Yeah yeah, oh oh oh
Who wouldn't go, oh oh oh
Who wouldn't go up on the housetop, yeah
Click click click
Down through the chimney (down through the chimney)
With good singing
Up on the housetop (up on the housetop)
From reindeer paws
Our jumpsuit or Santa Claus
All for the little ones
Oh yeah
All for the little ones
Well, next comes a stocking of little will
Oh, just see what a glorious fill
Oh, look at that
Here is a hammer and lots of tacks
And also a bone and a whip that cracks
Oh
Ho, ho, ho, who wouldn't go
Ho, ho, ho, who wouldn't go
Up on the housetop (up on the housetop)
Click, click, click
Down through the chimney (down through the chimney)
With good faith, think
Up on the housetop
For the house towns, for reindeer paws
Our jumps good old Santa Claus
All for the little ones (for the house towns)
Click, click, click, down through the chimney
Down through the chimney, with good St. Nick
Up on the house top, up on the house top
For the reindeer boys, oh
I'll jump good on Santa Claus
All for the little, all for the little
All for the little
All for the little ones
