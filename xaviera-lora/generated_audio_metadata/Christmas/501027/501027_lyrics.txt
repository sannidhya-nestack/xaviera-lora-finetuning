O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appears
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
O come, thou rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Satan's tyranny
From depths of hell Thy people sing
And give them victory over the dead
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
