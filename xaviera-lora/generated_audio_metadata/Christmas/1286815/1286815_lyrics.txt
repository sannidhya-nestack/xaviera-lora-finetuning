Snow falling on the town bright
Laughter echoes in the cold moonlight
Santa's coming bringing joy and cheer
Mistletoe magic gets you near
Beat the blues with Christmas hues
Wrap your worries in twinkling views
Candy canes and gingerbread delights
Feel the warmth on frosty nights
Tinsel sparkles on the tree so high
Children's faces light up the sky
Stockings hung with care and dreams
Family bonds are stronger it seems
Beaker blues with Christmas hues
Wrap your worries in twinkling views
Candy canes and gingerbread delights
Feel the warmth on frosty nights
Tinsel sparkles on the tree so high
Children's faces light up the sky
Stockings hung with care and dreams
Family bonds are stronger it seems
Beaker blues with Christmas hues
Grab your worries and twinkling views
Candy canes and gingerbread delights
Feel the warmth on frosty nights
Hot cocoa in a mug so sweet
Cozy fires bring the heartbeats
Sleigh bells ringing pure delight
Christmas magic in the night
Stars are shining so bright above
Echoes of laughter filled with love
Gifts of kindness spread for cheer
Christmas spirit brings us near
