Snow is falling on the town bright
Laughter echoes in the cold moonlight
Santa's coming bringing joy and cheer
Mistletoe magic gets you near
Paint the blues with Christmas hues
Wrap your worries in twinkle-infused
Candy canes and gingerbread delights
Feel the warmth on frosty nights
Tinsel sparkles on the trees so high
Children's faces light up the sky
Stockings hung with care and dreams
Family bonds are stronger it seems
Lidl blues with Christmas shoes
Wrap your worries in twinkling views
Candy canes and gingerbread delights
Feel the warmth on frosty nights
Hot cocoa in a mug so sweet
Cozy fires bring the heartbeat
Sleigh bells ringing, pure delight
Christmas magic in the night
Stars are shining so bright above
Echoes of laughter filled with love
Gifts of kindness spread the cheer
Christmas spirit brings us near
Stars are shining so bright above
Echoes of laughter filled with love
Gifts of kindness spread the cheer
Christmas spirit brings us near
