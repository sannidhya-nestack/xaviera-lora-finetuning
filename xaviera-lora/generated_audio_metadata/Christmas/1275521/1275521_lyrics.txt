The fire's soft, the lights are low
Outside the world is draped in snow
Your laughter fills this quiet room
Like Christmas lights in perfect bloom
Underneath the mistletoe I see your smile
It's just us two for a little while
The world can wait, it's you and me
Locked in love on Christmas Eve
The scent of pine
The candles gleam
Feels like we're living in a dream
I hold you close
Your hands in mine
This love's the greatest gift to find
Underneath the mistletoe I see your smile
It's just us two for a little while
The world can wait, it's you and me
Rocked in love on Christmas Eve
The stars above, the candles gleam
And nothing glows like you tonight
And in your eyes, I see it clear
My heart belongs to you, my dear
Underneath the mistletoe
I see your smile
It's just us two
For a little while
The world can wait
It's you and me
Wrapped in love on Christmas Eve
Wrapped in love, just you and me
On this perfect Christmas Eve
