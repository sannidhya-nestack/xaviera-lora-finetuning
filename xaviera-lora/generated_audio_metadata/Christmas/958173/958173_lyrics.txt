We dragged the tree up four long flights of stairs
Dressed it up in tints of lights
Sang off key carols in the crisp clean air
When I sing in silent nights
Dressed in our red suits and our black boots
All the real stones in our party, yeah
Here but in the nights in the north, yeah
It's a long flight from the North Pole
But South Park cookies and wine
We're in our red suits and our black boots
Maybe tonight
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby tonight
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa
Lights flash so he'll know it's the place to stop
There's no charge to valet the sleigh
Wake up the neighbors even call the cops
Everyone
He's headed this way
Dressed in their red suits and their black boots
On the roof, no one's in our party, yeah
Invited the nice and the gnarly, yeah
It's a long flight from the North Pole
First out for cookies and wine (first out for cookies and wine)
I'm in our red suits and our black boots, baby tonight
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby tonight
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa
Sliding down chains ain't much fun
But you win, his work is done
On the roof, throwin' Santa a party, yeah
In bed, and the night's in the night, yeah
It's a long flight from the North Pole
But South Park cookies and wine (but South Park cookies and wine)
I'm in the red suits and the black boots, baby tonight (night)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, baby tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
