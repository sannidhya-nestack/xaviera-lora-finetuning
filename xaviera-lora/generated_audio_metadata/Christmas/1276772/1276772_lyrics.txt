Frosty windows, gentle night
Holding hands in soft moonlight
Walking through this winter's dream
Love reflected in the gleam
In the stillness, hear the cheer
Christmas magic drawing near
Frosty kisses, warm embrace
Love's sweet touch on every face
In this season hearts will glow
Underneath the falling snow
Candlelight and, and whistle-toe
Everywhere we seem to go
Sharing secrets, stolen glance
In this festive, pure romance
In the stillness, hear the cheer
Christmas magic drawing near
Frosty kisses, warm embrace
Love's sweet touch on every face
In the season hearts will glow
Underneath the falling snow
Ooh, underneath the falling snow
Candlelight and mistletoe
Everywhere we seem to go
Sharing secrets, stolen glance
In this festive pure romance
In the stillness hear the cheer
Christmas magic drawing in
Frosty kisses warm embrace
Love sweet touch on every face
In this season hearts will glow
Underneath the falling snow
Stars that twinkle in the night
Guide us through the season bright
In your arms I find my home
Never more to be alone
Frosty kisses, warm embrace
Love's sweet touch on every face
In the season hearts will glow
Underneath the falling snow
