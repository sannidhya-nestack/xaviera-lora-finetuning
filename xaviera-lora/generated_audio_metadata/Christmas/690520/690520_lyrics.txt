Oh Christmas tree
Oh Christmas tree
You stand in verdant beauty
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree
You stand in verdant beauty
Your boughs are green in summer's glow
And do not fade in winter's snow, oh
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree
You stand in verdant beauty
Oh Christmas tree
Oh Christmas tree
Your candles shine out brightly
Oh Christmas tree (Oh Christmas tree)
Oh Christmas tree
Your candles shine out brightly
Each bell does hold a tiny light
That makes each tone to sparkle bright, bright
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree
Thy candles shine on brightly
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree
Thy candles shine on brightly
