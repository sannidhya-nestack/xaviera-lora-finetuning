O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and rejoice
O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him, Christ the Lord
Light of light
Gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria, gloria
Mary God, begotten, not created, O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him.
In Christ the Lord
See how the shepherd summons to his cradle
Living death must go nigh with glory filled
We, too, will live now, and our joyful footsteps, O come, let us adore him, O come, let us adore him, O come, let us adore him, Christ the Lord.
Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation,
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven.
Alleluia, alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia!
O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, Alleluia!
