Hi kids, Christmas is such an exciting time of the year
Did you ever lie in bed on Christmas Eve
And suddenly hear Santa's bells up in the sky?
I know I did once
I tried to look out the window and see his sleigh
But somehow he got away
Merry Christmas ho ho ho
Santa Claus is coming
With a pack upon his back
Santa Claus is coming
With the reindeer in the sky
Santa Claus goes flying by
See them there way up high
Hear the bells up in the sky
Merry Christmas ho ho ho
Santa Claus is coming
With a pack upon his back
Santa Claus is coming
Now they're landing on the ground
Then the chimney he comes down
Bringing presents all around
Doesn't even make a sound
Merry Christmas ho ho ho
Santa Claus is coming
With a pack upon his back
Santa Claus is coming
Up the chimney he will go
Out into the night of snow
Oh, the chilly wind does blow
Goodnight Santa, ho, ho, ho
Merry Christmas, ho, ho, ho
Santa Claus is coming
With a pack upon his back
Santa Claus is coming
Merry Christmas, ho, ho, ho
Santa Claus is coming
With a pack upon his back
Santa Claus is coming
