Downtown lights are twinkling bright
Shop windows dressed in red and white
Carolers sing on street corners there
While snowflakes twirl through city air
This tinsel town at Christmas time
Feels like your heart wrapped up in rhyme
Every face wears a smile today
As children laugh and music plays in our tinsel town
Santa's ringing new bells of gold
Hot chestnuts warm hands in the cold
Horse-drawn carriages clip-clop by
As evening paints the winter sky
This tinsel town at Christmas time
Feels like your heart wrapped up in rhyme
Every face wears a smile today
As children laugh and music plays
In our tinsel town
The city glows with hope tonight
Every dream shines crystal bright
Strangers greet with warm hellos
As Christmas spirit overflows
This tinsel town at Christmas time
Feels like your heart wrapped up in rye
Every face wears a smile today
As children laugh and music plays in our tinsel town
