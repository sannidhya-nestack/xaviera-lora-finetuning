Three kings of orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and mountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star
Oh, star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Born a king on Bethlehem's plain
Gold I bring to crown him again
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign
Oh, star of my heart
Star of night, star with loyal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Glorious now, behold Him arise
King and God unsacrificed
Alleluia, alleluia
Heaven to earth replies
Oh, star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Guide us to thy perfect light
