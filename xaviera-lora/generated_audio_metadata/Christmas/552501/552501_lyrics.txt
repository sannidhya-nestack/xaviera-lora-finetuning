It's just a tiny tree with a star and colored lights
Barely fits in our apartment but feels so cozy right
We brought it home together decorated it with love
I can't wait for tomorrow, it's all I'm thinking of
On our first married Christmas
As husband and wife
This is only our beginning
Cause I will love you all my life
I thank the Lord above us
For granting all our Christmas wishes
With the hope each year
You will be as blessed as this is our first married Christmas
In the morning we will raise
Like children filled with glee
To see what each has hidden
Underneath our Christmas tree
A kiss under the mistletoe
Cider and a soft sunrise
When I wrap my arms around you
You'll see the love there in my eyes
On our first married Christmas, as husband and wife
This is only our beginning,'cause I will love you all my life
I thank the Lord
God above us for granting all our Christmas wishes
With the hope each year will be as blessed
Hence this is our first Merry Christmas
We'll spend time with both our families
And enjoy a Christmas feast
All their love, the warmth and laughter
Will make this special day complete
On our first married Christmas
As husband and wife
This is only our beginning
I thank the Lord above us for granting all our Christmas wishes
With the hope each year will be as blessed as this is
On our first married Christmas
As husband and wife
This is only our beginning
Cause I will love you all my life
I thank the Lord above us
For granting all our Christmas wishes
With the hope each year
We will be as blessed as this is
Our first married Christmas
Our first married Christmas
