Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Dashing through the snow
In one horse open sleigh
About the up we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on cocktails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in one horse open sleigh, hey!
Dashing through the snow in one horse open sleigh
Oh, the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring, making spirits bright
Oh, what fun it is to laugh and sing a sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in one horse open sleigh, hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in one horse open sleigh, hey!
