Love, moonlight glistens on the snow
In the night our spirits glow
On the wall we take a ride
Sleigh bells ringing far and wide
Through the fields of sparkling white
Guided by the starlit night
Stay right under the stars
Holding close no matter how far
In this moment pure delight
Christmas magic in the night
Horses breath in frosty air
Whispers of a love we share
Laughing as we glide along
Hearts united in this song
Through the fields of sparkling white
Guided by the starlit night
Stay right under the stars
Holding close no matter how far
In this moment, pure delight
Christmas magic in the night
Horses breath in frosty air
Whispers of the love we share
Laughing as we glide along
Hearts united in this song
Do do do do do do do do
As the snowflakes gently fall
We find wonder in it all
Underneath the twinkling sky
Time stands still as we fly by
Lay right under the stars
Holding close no matter how far
In this moment pure delight
Christmas magic in the night
Memories we'll cherish dear
In this season full of cheer
Every smile, every kiss
Captured in our hearts like this
As the night turns into day
Slay ride dreams will light our way
Christmas love forever ours
Guided by the midnight stars
As the night turns into day
Sleigh ride dreams will light our way
Christmas love forever our way
