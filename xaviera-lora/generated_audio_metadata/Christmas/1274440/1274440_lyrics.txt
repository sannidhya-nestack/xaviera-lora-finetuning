Snow is falling, lights are bright
Sleigh bells ringing through the night
Dancing feet on frosty street
Swinging to that jolly beat
Candy cane and hot cocoa
Merry vibes, we let it flow
Tinsel trees and window frames
Swinging tunes in festive frames
Jingle, jangle round we go
Twist and turn in golden glow
Snap your fingers, clap your hands
Feel the rhythm of the band
More in twenties meets your tide
Sparkling cheer we can't hide
Flapper hats and Christmas lights
Little glows on chilly nights
Snowflakes falling soft and white
Grooving in the winter light
Every heart is full of cheer
Bringing joy and joy in the air
Jingle, jangle round we go
Twist and turn in golden glow
Snap your fingers, clap your hands
Feel the rhythm of the band
Warring twenties meets yuletide
Sparkling cheer we can't hide
Flapper hats and Christmas lights
Glitter glows on chilly nights
Small fish falling soft and white
Grooving in the winter light
Every heart is full of cheer
Bringing joy and drawing near
Jingle, jangle round we go
Twist and turn in golden glow
Snap your fingers, clap your hands
Feel the rhythm of the band
