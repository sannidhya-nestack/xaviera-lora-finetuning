The days switch out slow and swoon
I count the hours far from everything
The lights shine in distance
But your smile, well, I miss it so
I while away the time gently dreaming of you
And the moment when your steps will find a way
To my heart, yes, I wait
The fir trees dance under the wind
The garlands glow a touch of white
But without you all seems grey
I wait for Christmas lost in time
I while away the time gently dreaming of you
And the moment when your steps will find a way
To my heart yes I wait the fir trees dance under the wind
The garments glow a touch of white
But without you all seems grey
I wait for Christmas lost in time
I'll wallow away
The time gently dreaming of you
And the moment when your steps will find a way
To my heart, yes I wait
Yes I'll wait
Yes I will
Yes I'll wait
Yes I will
