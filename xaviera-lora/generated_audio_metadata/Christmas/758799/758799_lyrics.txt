The first Noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that
Was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far and deep
It gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King
Love is right
