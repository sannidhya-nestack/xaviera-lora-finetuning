Ave Maria
Where have you been hiding?
Don't you know we need you?
Things are looking pretty bad down here
I know that there is beauty
Gentleness and laughter
These are things you always stood for
Help us find them too
Hey there, Maria
Santa Maria
May I take a liberty
And say that it's a shame to me
Not to live in harmony
We're all just hoping
Someone will step forward singing
Amen
Amen
Come on let us join in
And sing Ave Maria
Where have you been hiding?
Don't you know we need you?
Things are looking pretty bad down here
I know you hear the fighting
See the torch we're lighting
On our quest for peace and freedom
Help us see this through
Hey there Maria, Santa Maria
Maria, Maria
May I take liberty
And say that it's a shame to me
Not to live in harmony
We're all just hoping
Someone will step forward singing
Amen, Amen
Come on and let us join in and sing
Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen
