Snowflakes dance like stars above
In the air a scent of love
With gypsy tunes we play our part
It's Christmas on the card
The fire's warm, the night is cold
Stories of the seasons told
Gypsy strums and fingers smart
It's Christmas on the card
Oh, merry melodies we weave
Under twinkling lights we dream
With every note a joyful spark
It's Christmas on the card
Laughter shed and whispers sweet
With dancing feet and joyful beat
Gather round the strings and heart
It's Christmas on the card
Beyond the tinsel and the cheer
What brings us close is crystal clear
A gypsy rhythm never far
It's Christmas on the card
Oh merry melodies we weave
Under twinkling lights we dream
With every note a joyful spark
It's Christmas on the card
Oh, merry melodies we weave
Under twinkling lights we dream
With every note a joyful spark
It's Christmas on the card
