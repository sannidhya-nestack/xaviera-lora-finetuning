God rest ye merry gentlemen, may nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Saviour was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray
Oh, oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
Oh, oh, tidings of comfort and joy
From God our Heavenly Father a blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same
How glad in Bethlehem was born the Son of God, my name
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
In Bethlehem in Jewry this blessed babe was born
Yeah, laid within a manger upon this holy morn
That which is mother Mary did nothing take in scorn
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy, oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy, oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy, oh, tidings of comfort and joy
