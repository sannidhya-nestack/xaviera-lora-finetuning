Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight
And sing this slaying song
Just pay the Bobtail Bay
Two forty for his feed
And hitch him to an old friend's sleigh
And hope he'll take the lead
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
