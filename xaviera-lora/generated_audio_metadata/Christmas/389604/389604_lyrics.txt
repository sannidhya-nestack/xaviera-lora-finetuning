Happy holidays from me to you
May all your dreams and wishes come true
Have a happy holiday
Let's all sing and play
We'll throw your troubles away on this holiday
There's always a special kind of love
A magic feeling from the stars above
Have a happy holiday (Holiday)
Let's all sing and play
We'll throw your troubles away on this holiday (Holiday)
A happy holiday from me to you
May all your wishes and dreams come true
And have a happy holiday
I want for all of us to sing and play
And we'll take your troubles away on this holiday
Have a happy holiday (happy holiday)
I want for all of us to sing and play (all of us to sing and play)
And I will take your troubles away on this holiday
Happy Holiday
