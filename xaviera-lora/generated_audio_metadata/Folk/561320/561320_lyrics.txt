What the hell is wrong with everyone
What the hell is wrong with the world
Load up your bombs and guns
Murder all the innocent ones
Till every single last one of them is gone
Someone will come along
Every once in a while
That makes this whole spinning earth
Seem so juvenile
And so it goes
Another day comes to a close
But what can we do?
Just sit here and watch
The world never speeds up, nor does it slow down
But it seems like it stops turning for just an hour or two
To make sure everything is still green and blue
And so it goes, another day comes to a close
Where are we going now?
When the hell will all this turn around?
Let us not be defined
Let us not be confined
Give us some sort of other reality
Don't let us lie awake tonight
Give us some false peace of mind
To wrap our thoughts around
Maybe someone will come along
To set our minds at ease
I can't see it happenin' soon
Unless someone hears my pleas, ooh
And so it goes
Another life comes to a close
