There was a gallant, lofty ship a-sailing on the sea
Though high, though low, and so sailed we
And our captain, he was searching for the pirate's enemy
A-sailing down along the coast of High Marbury
Look ahead, look astern, look the weather and the lee
Low high, low low, and so sailed we
I see a wreck to windward and a lofty ship to lee
A sailing down along the coast of high Barbary
We'll hail her, we'll hail her, our gallant captain cried
Though high below and so sailed we
Are you a man of war or a privateer pridey?
A-sailing down along the coast of High Barbary
No, I'm not a man of war, no privateer, cruddy
Though high, though low, and so sailed we
But I'm a salty pirate, all a searchin' for me
A-sailin' down along the coast of high Barbarie
For broadside, for broadside, a long time we lay
Though high, though low, and so sailed we
Low and so sailed we
Until at last the frigate shot the pirates fast away
A sailing down along the coast of High Harbour E
From quarters to quarters the saucy pirates cried
"Lohai !"
I, alone, so sailed we
The quarters that we gave'em was to sink'em in the tide
A-sailing down along the coast of High Harbour Wee
But, oh, it was a cruel sight and raved us full sore
Low high, low low, and so sailed we
To sea them all were drownin' as they tried to swim to shore
A-sailin' down along the coast of High Barbary
Heartless and with one oar we fought them our way
Low high, low low, and so sailed we
And the ship, it was their coffin
And their grave, it was the sea
Sailing down along the coast of High Arboree
