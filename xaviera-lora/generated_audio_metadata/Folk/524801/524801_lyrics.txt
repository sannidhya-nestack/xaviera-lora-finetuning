There's a photo lying on the table of friends from years ago
Forty-two folks from high school, only five who I'd still know
From a small town in Ohio
We're spread all over the globe
Back home again to reunite
Hoping our friendships grow
Wondering if it's a good idea
To relive those days again
Opening up the old shoebox
Can be a dangerous game
Not sure if there's a future
At the end of memory lane
Some folks found their fortune
A few lives came to a stop
While flowers came in to blossom
The prom queen's not so hot
From a small town in Ohio
We spread all over the globe
Back home again to reunite
Hoping our friendships grow
Wondering if it's a good idea
To relive those days again
Opening up the old shoebox
Can be a dangerous game
Not sure if there's a future
At the end of memory lane
We danced and dined and reminisced
Someone remembered their first kiss
Headed home from a long weekend
Will we get together again? I don't know
Wondering if it's a good idea
To relive those days again
Opening up the old shoebox
Can be a dangerous game
Not sure if there's a future
At the end of memory lane
Not sure if there's a future
At the end of memory lane
