Here I am on this runway
Swimming from face to face
Recalling all that is beautiful
Just growing into my race
Tripped and real in reality
I'm wondering where is my gate
Ebbing flow and change and grow
Transgressing into my fate
Deviations from life
People in all phases of life
From child to elder in strife
One third to one half through
Force to choose to do
Keep the faith till it's gone
Now I don't know but I've been told
Most things in life are worth your soul
But you sell it even though you know
We all continue to grow
Left and right and back again
Fill those spaces with your friends
Wander out in the dark
Till you can't feel it break apart
Deviations from life
People in all phases of life
From child to elder in strife
One third to one half through
Force to choose to do
Keep the faith till it's gone
