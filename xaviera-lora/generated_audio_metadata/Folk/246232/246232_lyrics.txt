We often speak to no one listening
Though seemingly bleak, the colours glistening
Love the rhythm of the creek, water slow and blistering
Hot to the touch is the dust that lands
Demons as a crutch is thought that stands
The test of time and as much as the force that it demands
Why follow without question?
Why wallow in oh, always fear?
La da da da da
La da da da da
La do lo li la da
La da da da ni na da
Speak from the heart,'cause the heart is heavy
Give away love,'cause love she shines everywhere
Take from nothing, you come and make available everything
We often speak to no one listening
