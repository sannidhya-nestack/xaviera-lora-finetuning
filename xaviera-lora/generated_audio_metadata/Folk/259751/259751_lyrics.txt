Let me breathe for just a moment
I guess the day has now arrived
Will I be like my father was when he was young
Did he believe that he knew what was right
Oh how can I be saved
I'm feeling this tonight
What about love
What about truth
And what about me by your side
And what about love
And what about truth
What about me by your side
I never felt the need to question
What I wanted out of life
But you're all that matters now
And I wanna know
And I wanna feel like it's gonna be alright
Oh help me with these fears
And tear me up inside
What about love?
And what about truth?
What about me by your side?
And what about love?
What about truth?
What about me by your side?
We always believed we could decide
But woke up to someone else's life
Then how could we have known
What about love? What about truth? What about me by your side?
And what about love? And what about truth? What about me by your side?
