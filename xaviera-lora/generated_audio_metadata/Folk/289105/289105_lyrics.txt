Let us pause in life's pleasures
And count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times come again no more
the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more
There's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
With a worn heart whose better days are o'er
Though her voice would be merry
sighing all the day
Oh, hard times come again no more
the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more
While we seek mirth in beauty and music bright and gay
There are frail forms fading at the door
Though their voices are silent
Their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times come again no more
the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door
Oh, hard times, come again no more
Oh hard times come again
