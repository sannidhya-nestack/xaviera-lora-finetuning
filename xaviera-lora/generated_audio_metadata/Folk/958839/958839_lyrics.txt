Don't run, try not to hide
Call me from the other side
Bring what you hope to find
So maybe don't run
Try not to hide
And I, I, I
Oh how I try not to hide
Caught up in the riptide
Flipside
Don't go running, don't go hiding, don't go running
Don't go running, don't go hiding, don't go running
Love sings all day all night
Dark things will bring you light
Try me though I'm out of sight
baby love sings all day all night
And oh, how my love sings through the night
Caught up in the red tide, flipside
Don't go running
Don't go hiding
Don't go running
Try not to, try not to
Don't go running
Don't go hiding
Don't go running
Try not to, try not to hide
There's time
I try not to, try not to hide
All this time
Don't hide dark things
Don't go love sings
Don't hide dark things
Don't go love sings
Don't hide dark things
Don't go love sings
Love sings
Love sings
Love sings
Love sings, yeah
Oh, love sings
