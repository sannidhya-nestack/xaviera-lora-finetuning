It's one of those days
Everybody's in your way
All the lights are red
Should've stayed in bed
And pulled the shades
Everybody's stressed out
Oh, makes you wanna check out
Before you come undone
Looks like someone could use a hug
You need a hug, a tender touch
A little love you dive when I give too much
Makes you wanna sing like a bird and buzz like a bee
Puts a grin on your face like a chimpanzee
Like the spin of the earth, just slow down
And you can't quite keep your feet on the ground
When you need to feel that rush, you need a hug
Just a human touch
It doesn't take that much
Chicken soup for the soul
Get you out of the hole
Out of the rut
I squeeze around the middle
I guarantee that it'll
Be a miracle drug
So bring it on in
Hug it on up
You need a hug, a tender touch
A little love you dove when I give too much
Makes you wanna sing like a bird and buzz like a bee
Puts a grin on your face like a chimpanzee
Like the spin of the earth, just slow down
And you can't quite keep your feet on the ground
When you need to feel that rush
You need a hug
Nothing weird about it
Just wrap your arms around it
And share the love
You need a hug
A tender touch, a little lovey-dove when I kiss too much
Makes you wanna sing like a bird and buzz like a bee
Puts a grin on your face like a chimpanzee
Like the spin of the earth, just slow down
And you can't quite keep your feet on the ground
When you need to feel that rush, you need a hug
Yes when you need to feel that rush
You need a hug
