I can see the sunlight peeking out beyond this stony wall and
I can see the clouds are coming I hear the rain as it falls and
I can feel the breeze a blowing or watch it rustle through the trees and
I am here right now but soon I think that I'll be leaving
You roll your eyes and wonder why I do not cry
Why so happy with my plain and simple life
Look around and let the world up in your eyes
I can feel the sunshine now far beyond that stony wall and
I can see the clouds are going, I hear the rain as it stops falling
I can feel the warm breeze blowing, hammocks swinging in the trees and
I am here right now, ain't no use in leaving, leaving
There are many who can't see and they wish they could
But they smile anyway cause they're here real good
Those who know no sound are happy that their eyes can see
What's the deal with you and me
You need to look inside and change that point of view
Change your point of view
Stop listen can you hear it
So tell me, why do you fear it?
I don't wanna wake up sad
I don't wanna feel so blue
I don't wanna feel that bad
I'm not unhappy, how about you?
Maybe the problem is you
Maybe that problem's you
'Cause I don't wanna wake up sad, no
I don't wanna feel so blue
(I don't wanna wake up sad)
I don't wanna feel that bad, no
I'm not unhappy, how'bout you?
(You don't wanna feel so blue)
I don't wanna feel so blue
Oh no, no, no
That problem's you
Uh-uh,'cause I can see that sunlight
I don't wanna wake up sad
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, no
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna,
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna,
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
Wake up sad
Wake up sad
Oh no, no, no, I don't feel that bad
I can feel the sunshine now
Far beyond that stony wall
I can see the clouds are going
Feel the rain as it stops falling
And the hammock is swingin' I'm here right now and
Well I ain't leavin'
maybe that problem is you
Oh, you gotta stop and live
