From this valley they say you are going
I will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
For they say you are taking the sunshine
Which has brightened our pathway while
Come and sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
But remember the Ohio Valley
And the one who has loved you so true
Won't you think of the valley you're leaving
Oh how lonely how sad it will be
And think of the fond heart you're breaking
And the grief you are causing me
Come and sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
But remember the Ohio Valley
And the one who has loved you so true
As you go to your home by the ocean
May you never et those sweet hours
That we spent in the Ohio Valley
And the love we exchanged amid the flowers
Come and sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
But remember the Ohio Valley
And the one who has loved you so true
And remember the Ohio Valley
And the one who has loved you so true
