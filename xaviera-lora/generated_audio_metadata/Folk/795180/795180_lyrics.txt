As I walked out of the London Bridge One misty morning early
I overheard a fair pretty maiden Was lamenting her voyage away
Oh, my journey will be a hind in a golden chain
not a chain of many
He was born of King's royal breed
And lost to a virtuous lady
Go bridle me, my milk-white steed
Go bridle me, my pony
I will ride to London's court
And to plead for the life of Jodie
Oh, my Jodie never stole, no cow, no calf
He never hurt a denny
Stole sixteen of the king's royal jeer
And his own they've been blaming
Two pretty babies, who have I inborn
Peter lies in my body
I'd freely part with them, everyone
If you'd spare their life for Jodie
The judge looked over his left shoulder
He said, "Fair maid, I'm sorry"
Said we made it, you must be gone
For I cannot pardon your leave
All my jewelry was behind in a golden chain
This not the chain of many
Stole sixteen of the king's royal deer
And he sold them in plenty
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Exiled out over London Bridge
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, yes, I walked out on a London break
