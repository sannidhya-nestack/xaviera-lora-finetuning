I loved trains junked off the track
Like a bolt out of the blue
It was like a sneak attack
From the girl I thought I knew
I don't know just what I lack
But I know just what I'll do
You don't have to love me back
But I'll keep on loving you
Oh, you don't have to love me back
But I'll keep on loving you
My bright blue skies turned to black
When you changed your point of view
I watched your wedding vow crack
Well, mine stays forever true
And I don't know just what I lack
But I know just what I'll do
You don't have to love me back
But I'll keep on loving you
Oh, you don't have to love me back
But I'll keep on loving you
Yeah my blue skies turned to black
When you found somebody new
You told me I better pack
Said take this wedding ring too
And I don't know just what I lack
But I know just what I'll do
You don't have to love me back
But I'll keep on loving you
Oh, you don't have to love me back
But I'll keep on loving you
Now I'm shivering in this shack
Down to my last buck or two
I just checked my almanac
More big storms are coming through
And I don't know just what I lack
But I know just what I'll do
You don't have to love me back
But I'll keep on loving you
Oh, you don't have to love me back
But I'll keep on loving you
