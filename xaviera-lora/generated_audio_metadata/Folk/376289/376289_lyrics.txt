I don't squeeze a puppy, I don't squeeze a cat
If I squeeze either one, they'll jump from my lap
Soul's got to fly free like butterflies
Soul's got to fly free
That's just how they be, like you and me
Souls got to fly free, like butterflies
When I'm stuck in deep concern
I take two step backward and see the pattern
Soul's got to fly free
Like butterflies
Souls got to fly free
That's just how they be
Like you and me
Souls got to fly free
Like butterflies
I try not to hold on, I never grasp
For this illusion of living is not gonna last
Soul's got to fly free like butterflies
Souls got to fly free (oh yeah)
That's just how they be
Like you and me
Souls got to fly free
Like butterflies
Souls got to fly free (let'em fly)
That's just how they be
Like you and me, souls got to fly free
Like butterflies, oh let'em fly
