Matthew let Ezell grow
Mike wore a pink T-shirt
He wanted to be rock stars
They played no white girls, rash
They had many girls
Who asked them for autographs
They didn't care at all
They play in a white garage
Matthew wore old tennis shoes
Marked Harris jeans and bars
They wanted to be rock stars
They played in a white garage
They had many girls
Who asked them for autographs
But they didn't care at all
They played in a white garage
They had many girls who asked them for autographs
But they didn't care at all, they played in a white garage
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-da-ba-ba
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da-da-day
