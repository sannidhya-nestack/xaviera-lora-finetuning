When the wind blows hard against your windows
And the trees shake their naked limbs
When the flowers are covered up with deep snow
And the sun shines its lights dim
Remember times when summer's sky was so blue
Remember times when green was on the trees
And in the nights when sadness does surround you
It'll fare you well if you remember these
When it seems your heart has been forsaken
And kind words are lost and can't be found
When your faith in people has been shaken
And your friends no longer come around
Remember times when flowers were all blooming
Remember times when you danced in the summer breeze
And in the nights when everything seems gloomy
It'll fare you well if you remember these
Remember times when summer sky was so blue Remember times when green was on the tree
And in the nights when sadness does surround you
It'll fare you well if you remember these
It'll fare you well if you remember these
