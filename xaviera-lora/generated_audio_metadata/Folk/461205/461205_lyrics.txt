You could love me like I love you
It could be a sweet romance
It could be the best
But we'll never know unless
You will give me just one little chance
Say the grass is always greener
Just across the fence
Leave it for the cows
We could have love right here right now
If you would give me just one little chance
Everyday we get just a little bit older
With a little less time to find what we're dreaming of
Won't you take just a minute
Take a look over your shoulder
Don't overlook the one who can give you all her love
There's no need to be so lonely
Our fate is in our hands
I'm not too proud to beg
we could sure start something big
If you would give me just one little chance
Every day we get just a little bit older
With a little less time to find what we're dreaming of
Won't you take just a minute, take a look over your shoulder
Don't overlook the one who can give you all her love
There's no need to be so lonely
Our fate is in our hands
I'm not too proud to beg
But we could sure start something big
If you would give me just one little chance
If you would give me just one little chance
You will give me just one little chance
