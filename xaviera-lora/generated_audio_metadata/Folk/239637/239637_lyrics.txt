A life will pass you by
If you're a someday person always putting off
What you can do today
We're born to have a life
Till the clock stops and takes it all away
You've got to live for today
You've gotta be in this day
It's moments like now you'll miss
yesterday didn't stay
So don't lose your way
You just live for today
You gotta live for today
If you worry about tomorrow
It's life this day you borrow
To worry about the things
There's no control over
Best to stay in the moment
You'll deal with what life brings
You've got to live for today
You've got to be in this day
Tomorrow is far away
Yesterday didn't want to stay
Embrace life in a new way
You gotta live this day your way
Live a life on this day
If you hang on to yesterday
you lost your smile
And even lost your way
And more memories are yet to be
They're in every moment and you'll see
You've got to live for today
You've got to be in this state
This moment's now your miss
As yesterday didn't stay
So don't lose your way
Just live life for today
You've gotta live for today
And I've lived in all three
Replaying pains of the past
Scared of the future
But the choice is only mine
To grasp the moments of now
And just live in this day
Just live
For today
