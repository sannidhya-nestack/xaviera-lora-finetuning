It's a lover's lullaby
Watch your dreams go drifting by
I'm a home where your fears can hide
Rest in my arms, close your eyes
I will be your pillow, a place to rest your weary head
I will be your blanket, in a warm inviting bed
It's a lover's lullaby, watch your dreams go drifting by
I'm a home where your fears can hide
Rest in my arms, close your eyes
I will be your shelter when the world goes by too fast
I will be your shield, dear, when the stones are being cast
It's a lover's lullaby
Watch your dreams go drifting by
I'm a home where your fears can hide
Rest in my arms, close your eyes
I will be your listener when you feel you must be heard
I will be an anchor in a dark and stormy world
It's a lover's lullaby watch your dreams go drifting by
I'm a home where your fears can hide
Rest in my arms, close your eyes
It's a lover's lullaby
Watch your dreams go adrift and by
I'm a home where your fears can hide
Rest in my arms, close your eyes
Close your eyes, close your eyes
Close your eyes, close your eyes
