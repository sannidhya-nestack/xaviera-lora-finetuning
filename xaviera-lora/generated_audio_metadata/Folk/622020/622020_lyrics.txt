So I sit here behind the veil of truth
While you go on believing it was real
That words could flow upon some gilded page
From thought to pen to act upon a stage
Long, long time ago
London in the snow
We kissed at Bishop's Gate
I held the dark lady
It just began as fun between us two
But then was known to all before we knew
Beneath me was this thespiatic prose
And so we hid the hand that penned this rose
Long, long time ago
London winds did blow
We kissed at Bishop's Gate
I held the dark lady
Long, long time ago
London in the snow
We kissed at Bishop's Gate
I held the dark lady
Long, long time ago
London, winds did blow
We kissed at Bishop's Gate
I held the dark lady
