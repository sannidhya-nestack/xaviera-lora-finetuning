Once there was an old man, I saw him pass me by
He was just an old man, but I saw him go right by
I don't know why he passed me by
Well, I don't know why he passed me by
But he passed me by
Once there was a young man, I saw him pass me by
He was just a young man, but I saw him go right by
I don't know why he passed me by
Well, I don't know why he passed me by
But he passed me by
He passed me by
Once there was this woman, I watched her pass me by
She was such a good one, but I let her go right by, and I know why
She passed me by,'cause I made her cry
And that is why she passed me by
She passed me by, they all passed me by
Don't pass me by
Don't pass me by
