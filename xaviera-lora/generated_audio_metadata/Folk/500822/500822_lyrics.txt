Under the tree, the sun is climbing high
I opened up to you my butterfly
Winds of seduction around us
Leaving my seeds under your wings
Under the tree, the sun is shining bright
Colors of lust, tingle in my eyes
Time drops, falls down on my petals
Leaving the wide open fields behind, oh
Bearing my life without you there
Under the graceful moon
I will carry it
With the memory of your whispers
Spring in my heart
Under the tree, the bitter ending night
I'm closing down on you my butterfly
Dance so the stars will remember
Flittering light in your last light, oh
Bearing my life without you there
Under the graceful moon
I will carry on
With the memory of your whispers
Spring in my heart
