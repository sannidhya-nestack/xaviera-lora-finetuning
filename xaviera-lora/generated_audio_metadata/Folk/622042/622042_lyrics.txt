I'm happy, happy, happy, happy
I love to see your smiling face
I'm happy, happy, happy my old friend, oh yeah
I'm happy, happy, happy, happy
Life is good the sun be shining
I'm happy, happy won't you sing with me, with me
I'm gonna take this day just as it comes
And when the stars come out we'll have some fun
Happy, happy, happy, happy
The music makes me feel so good
Happy, happy, my blues they melt away to stay
I'm happy, happy, happy, happy
My heart it has a song to sing
I'm happy, happy, won't you sing with me? Oh yeah
I'm gonna take this day just as it comes
And when the stars come out we'll have some fun
I'm gonna take this day just as it comes
And when the stars come out we'll have some fun
I'm happy, happy, happy, happy
I love to see your smiling face
Happy, happy, happy my old friend, oh yeah
I'm happy, happy, happy, happy
Life is good the sun is shining
Happy, happy won't you sing with me, oh yeah
