It was Friday morning when we set sail and we were not far from the land
When our captain, he spied a mermaid so fair with a comb and a glass in her hand
And the ocean waves do roll and the stormy winds do blow
And we poor sailors go skipping at the top
While the landlubbers lie down below, below, below
While the landlubbers lie down below
Well up spoke the captain of our gallant ship
And a fine old man was he (real old)
He said, "This fishy mermaid has warned us of our doom
We will sink to the bottom of the sea"
And the ocean waves do roll
And the stormy winds do blow
And we poor sailors go skipping at the top
While the landlubbers lie down below, below, below
While the landlubbers lie down below
Then up spoke the gunner of this gallant ship, and a sharp shooting arm had she
She said, "I may go down with the ship beneath the waves, but I'm taking me cannons with me"
And the ocean waves do roll, and the stormy winds do blow
And we poor sailors go skipping at the top
While the landlubbers lie down below, below, below
While the landlubbers lie down below
Then up jumped the laddie from this gallant ship
And he saw the mermaid smiling happily
He said, "I've never kissed a girl, I'll give that one a whirl"
And he leapt to the bottom of the sea
And the ocean waves do roll
And the stormy winds do blow
And we poor sailors go skipping at the top
While the land lovers lie down below, below, below
While the land lovers lie down below
I've been stuck on this ship for months and months and months
And I'm sick, as seasick as can be
They kept saying I'd get my sea leg soon
But'til then I'll be heaving in the sea
And the ocean waves do roll
And the stormy winds do blow
And we poor sailors could skip it at the top
While the Latin lovers lie down below, below, below
While the Latin lovers lie down below
Then off spoke the drunkard of our gallant ship
And an old besotted wretch was he
He said, "I once caught a mermaid, this bitch !"
And the ocean waves do roll
And the stormy winds do blow
And we poor sailors go skipping at the top
While the Latin lovers lie down below, below, below
While the Latin lovers lie down below
I've stowed away on this big old ship, looking for adventure on the sea
So far all I've found are rats and mice and fleas, and now they're the last men that I'll see
And the ocean waves do roll
And the stormy winds do blow
And we poor sailors go skipping at the top
While the landlubbers lie down below below below
While the landlubbers lie down below
Three times round spun our gallant ship, and three times round spun she
Three times round spun our gallant ship, and she sank to the bottom of the sea
And the ocean waves do roll, and the stormy winds do blow
And we poor sailors go skipping at the top
While the landlubbers lie down below, below, below
While the landlubbers lie down below
