Little bird, where did you come from?
Little bird, was it a long run?
Now you're here, I wish you could stay
Little bird, there's no time to rest
Little bird, gotta build a new nest
You've been travelling such a long way
And you don't seem to fear the speed of your flight
You just spread your wings and you soar into prisms of sunlight
You fly, little bird
Little bird, I could take a plane to Africa
Maybe down to Spain and see the world
From your point of view
Fly away, far from the cold as
Chill me down to my very soul
Little bird, if only you knew
How I've tied myself down
Set in bed, rock wild, the river flows all around
Here I'll stay until time and tide pull me away
So fly, little bird
And you don't seem to fear
Flying black against the blue sky
Then like magic you disappear
As elusive as the night to the day
You fly away
