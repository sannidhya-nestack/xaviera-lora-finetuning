The trees have dropped their leaves
The air is turning cold
There's no one here to speak to
There's no one here to hold
The sky's gone metal grey
I haven't felt the sun
Since we embraced
Since this war's begun
There's no one here to warm my bed
I'll carry on, I'll carry on
No shoulder where I rest my head
For my love is a soldier
I wander on the shore, I gaze beyond the waves
Horizon rises toward the sinking of the day (sinking of the day)
I wonder if he's safe, and what his eyes might see
I cannot rest inside myself'til he returns to me
There's no one here to hold my bed
I'll carry on, I'll carry on
No shoulder where I rest my head
For my love is a soldier
The same earth turns beneath us
Below a map of stars
The same heart knows to follow
Watch for me, I'll find you where you are
Our love and longing bind us
And I'll pretend I'm brave
our reunion finds us
Bathed in sunlight one bright day
If spring returns without you
And blossoms finally bloom
If rain-drenched earth smells dark and sweet
As I walk from my room
I'll wait for you to warm my bed
And I'll carry on
I'll carry on
On your shoulder I will rest my head
My love
My love, my love is a soldier
