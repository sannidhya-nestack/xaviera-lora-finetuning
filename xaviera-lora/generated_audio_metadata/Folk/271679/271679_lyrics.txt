Well, it was torture in that Twilight Zone
With the lights all off and the TV on
Somehow something did not belong
And what belonged was no longer there
And he tried to push the thought away
And he wondered what the day might bring
But it didn't matter much anyway
it was out of his control
And he briefly hoped the phone might ring
And he'd hear a voice like an angel sing
She could have said anything to melt his pain away
But he stopped himself'cause it ain't no use
And he borders on self abuse, imagining some kind of truth
In a world that's lost and gone
He remembered a scene from his childhood days
With his mom and his bros down by the bay
Now he used to hate those waves that tore his castles down
And he remembered a day in July
He left his mom for a job in Lafayette
Ended up tangled in a net from which he could not escape
She was pretty as the first spring day
Stormy as the month of May
And always seemed to get her way
No exception to the rule
He was fourteen months under her thumb
When he woke up to find his day had come
He loved her better than anyone
But she was leaving him behind
Really thought once more on the words she'd said
She packed a blue suitcase on his bed
It wasn't anything you did, more what you failed to do
And he licked his lips and he rubbed his eyes
And it shouldn't have come as such a surprise
She was young and pretty and full of life
While he'd been full of fear
Well that fear was gone now that much he knew
But it was far too late and he knew that too
Noticed it was quarter till too as he took it from the drawer
He opened the box and he put one in and
Lifted the barrel beneath his chin
Spoke her name out loud and then
It took his pain away
