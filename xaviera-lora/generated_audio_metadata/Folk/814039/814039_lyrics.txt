Within levels of illusion
People go always to the next conclusion
We need to let go
Come on in, bend your skin
Sit on down, pass it around
Surrender to the now, awaken
All that is, all within
On and on
Beyond
Join on in the discipline
Let it go, your status quo
Surrender to the now
We're getting there
All that is, all within
On and on
Eternal and beyond
Within language is confusion
Labels grow
Always to the next illusion
We need to let go
Fly on in, let's begin
Moving deeply into the now
Surrender to the now, wake up
All there is, all within
All and one
Eternal
Eternal and beyond
Eternal and beyond
