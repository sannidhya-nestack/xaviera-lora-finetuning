Molly went to Wollongong Wollongong, yes, Wollongong
Molly went to Wollongong And we sang her song
Molly went to Wollongong Wollongong, Wollongong
Molly went to Wollongong And we sang her song
She flew there for holiday To visit
And to play and like she had found there so decided to stay
Molly went to Wollongong, Wollongong, Wollongong
Molly went to Wollongong and we sang her song
Molly went to Wollongong, Wollongong, Wollongong
Molly went to Wollongong and we sang her song
There's no worries'bout the future there
Just because already it's tomorrow in the land of Oz
Miley went to Wollongong, Wollongong, Wollongong

Miley went to Wollongong, Wollongong, yes Wollongong
Miley went to Wollongong and we sing her song
