The way your body's talking to me
Is telling me something
The way you're walking, the way you're moving
It's got me wanting you too soon, too fast
Can't slow down even if I wanted to
Can't stop this feeling
Feeling way too good
Can't stop this feeling
Wouldn't even if I could
Can't stop this feeling
No, oh
Why hide it?
Why fight this feeling?
I can't stop this feeling
Thinkin'bout our shadows dancin'
Slow and sexy
Lookin' at you has got me thinkin'
About you and me
Goin' downtown, foolin' around
The two of us, makin' love in the moonlight
Can't stop this feelin'
Feelin' way too good
Can't stop
This feeling
Wouldn't even if I could
Can't stop this feeling
No, no, no
Why hide it?
Why fight?
I'm falling to temptation
Can't stop this feeling
I'm feeling way too good
Can't stop this feeling
Wouldn't even if I could
Can't stop this feeling
No, oh, oh, why
Why fight this feeling? (Can't stop this feeling)
I can't stop this feeling (Can't stop this feeling)
I can't stop it, no (Can't stop this feeling)
Can't stop this feeling (Can't stop this feeling
I can't stop, I can't stop, can't stop this feeling, no
Can't stop this feeling
I can't stop, no
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this feeling
