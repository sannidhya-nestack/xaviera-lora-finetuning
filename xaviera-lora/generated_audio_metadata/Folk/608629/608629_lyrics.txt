Her face was drained and her mind was set
On an end to being a road ahead
On a quest for change and a bigger life
She thought
I'm leaving you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She said I always known it would come to this
And there's nothing here for me to miss
The train was late but I couldn't stay
I had to hide my face and wait
Singing hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Didn't plan this from the start, no I
I don't see how it's my fault
We're always changing without cause, no I
Didn't mean for us to part
Ayy
It was a sunny day in a happy town
No dramatic rain or thunder here
Yeah I was hurting bad so I had to find
The means to leave it all behind
And
And
So I did some things I said I wouldn't do
Fifteen shots then they took my shoes
Then I spent the night on a concrete floor
I wanted more but they locked the door
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
