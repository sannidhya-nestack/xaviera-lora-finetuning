My life is a hell of a life
Hell of a life
Stay with me right here
We'll build a house from these stones
Cause what's a house without a home
A house without a home
These empty walls they always haunting me
Like ghosts when I'm alone
And no matter all the blankets on my bed
This night's never been so cold, love
But still I'm still here waiting
When the lights are just for you
Still I'm still here waiting
I'm waiting just for you
Should I keep my feet on the ground
Or my head up in the clouds
Cause I just need to hear the sound
But still I sit here waiting
With the lights on just for you
Still I'm still here waiting
Oh I'm waiting just for you
My lips are sealed with your blood
And hell will be my place
