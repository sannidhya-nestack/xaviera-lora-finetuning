Why don't you come around
Before we start the season of the summer days
Why don't you come again
And let it start from where you stop
And see me face to face
I promised myself nothing ever could break down my soul
When it's gonna stop
I don't even know
I'm looking for the reasons why I love you
So I can't even walk the streets
Cause everything I see
Brings back the memories
Why don't you come with me
And let me cross the world for you
While you just fall like rain between my fingers
Why you don't fall from grace
And let me show you how I'm feeling
Oh I promised myself nothing ever could break down my soul
When it's gonna stop
I don't even know
I'm looking for the reasons why I love you
So I can't even walk the streets
Cause everything I see
Brings back the memories
When it's gonna stop
I don't even know
I'm looking for the reasons why I love you so
I can't even walk the streets
Cause everything I see
Brings back the memories
When it's gonna stop
I don't even know
I'm looking for the reasons why I love you so
I can't even walk the streets
Cause everything I see
Brings back the memories
When it's gonna stop
I don't even know
I'm looking for the reasons why I love you so
I can't even walk the streets
Cause everything I see
Brings back the memories
When it's gonna stop
I don't even know
I'm looking for the reasons why I love you so
I can't even walk the streets
everything I see
Brings back the memories
