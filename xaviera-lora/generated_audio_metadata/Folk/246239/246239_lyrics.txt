When the sun comes up in my hometown
It won't shine on me today
For it seems as though this old winding road just keeps calling me away
And tired I grow of this winding road and sometimes I lie down
And I dream a dream of that mountain stream flowing through that sleepy town
Well, my grandma lives in that sleepy town
And her grandma lived there too
And everything in that sleepy town was so old there was nothing new
And tired I grew of that town I knew and I finally moved away
Now those memories all come back to me on a sad and lonesome day
Sometimes this world seems a weary place
With sadness everywhere
But my grandma sings of joyous things
Rockin' in her rockin' chair
And I leave my load by that winding road
When someday I move down
To a young girl's dream of that mountain stream
Flowin' through that sleepy town
When the sun comes up in my hometown
It won't shine on me today
For it seems as though this old winding road
Just keeps calling me away
And tired I grow of this winding road
And someday I'll lie down
And I'll dream a dream of that mountain stream flowing through that sleepy town
