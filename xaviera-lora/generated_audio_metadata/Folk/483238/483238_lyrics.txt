At this stage of the game
It's too late to raise, too soon to fold
At this stage of the game
Your run of luck is running cold
Are your bridges burned?
Mean you can't return?
Back the way you came
At this stage of the game
At this stage of the game
A hard act is following you
At this stage of the game
I keep trying to tell you something new
Sure you missed your shot
But you always thought
You'd still be in the frame
At this stage of the game
'Cause everybody has their time to shine
And you've had yours, now someone's shouting, "Hey, where's mine?"
One day you will outstay your welcome
It's hard to see that it could be just maybe
This stage of the game
At this stage of the game
You look back but all you see
At this stage of the game
The melting tracks of your history
And that once distant dread
Is now just up ahead
Where silence comes to claim
At this stage of the game
