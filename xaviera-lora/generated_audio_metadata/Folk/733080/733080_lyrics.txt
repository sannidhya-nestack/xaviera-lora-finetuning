Candlelit aroma, I am looking at you and all I see
Is darkness closing in, not much left to say
And no fight left in me, I guess this is when
Nobody wins, can't put this on me, I give everything I try
I wanted this to work with you, can't put this on you, I know you did too, so what more could we do?
But if I told you that I loved you, would you stay?
Would anything make a difference? Could we change?
It's nobody's fault and no one to blame
If I said it was me, babe, would you stay?
I guess this is life now
I guess this is it, how do I say goodbye
To my only wish
These knickknacks and things, they have lost their meaning
But I know that once they meant so much
Do we stifle this and now all wait for a meltdown?
All I know is this thing is just too hard to touch
You don't expect me to be just like you, I just can't
I just can't be this way
I don't expect you to change what you do
So we're stuck in a stalemate
But if I told you that I loved you, would you stay?
Would anything make a difference? Could we change?
It's nobody's fault and no one to blame
If I said it was me, babe, would you stay?
I guess this is life, darling
I guess this is it
So I'll blow this out and make a wish
That it doesn't have to come to this
With eyes closed tight and fingers crossed
A wish for all that's been lost
But if I told you that I loved you would you stay?
Would anything make a difference
Could we change
It's nobody's fault, no one to blame
If I said it was me, babe would you stay
I guess this is right, I guess this is it
If I told you that I loved you, would you stay?
Would anything make a difference? Could we change?
It's nobody's fault, and no one to blame
If I said it was me, babe, would you stay?
I guess this is lights out, I guess this is age
I guess this is lights out, oh, I guess this is it
I guess this is lifetime
Oh I guess this is it
How do I say goodbye
To my only wish?
