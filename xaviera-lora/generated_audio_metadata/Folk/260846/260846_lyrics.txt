Ah, for just one time, I would take the Northwest Passage
To find the hand of Franklin reaching for the Beaufort Sea
Tracing one warm line
Through a land so wild and savage
And make a northwest passage to the sea
Westward from the Davis Strait was there'twas said to lie
The sea route to the Orient for which so many died
Seeking gold and glory, leaving weathered broken bones
And a long otten lonely cairn of stone
Ah, for just one time I would take the Northwest Passage
To find the hand of Franklin reaching for the Pole Four Sea
Tracing one warm line through a land so wild and savage
And make a Northwest Passage to the sea
Three centuries thereafter, I take passage over land
In the footsteps of brave Kelso, where his sea of flowers began
Watching suitors rise before me
Then behind me sink again
This cardial stick's floor erases a heart across the plain
Ah, for just one time
I would take the northwest passage
To find the hand of Franklin
Reaching for the Beaufort sea
Tracing one warm line
Through a land so wild and savage
And make a northwest passage to the sea
And through the night, behind the wheel, the mileage clicking west
I think upon Mackenzie, David Thompson and the rest
Who cracked the mountain rampart and did show a path for me
To raise the roaring Frasier to the sea
Ah, for just one time I would take the Northwest Passage to find the end of Franklin reaching for a low-floor seat, tracing one warm line through a land so wild and savage, and make a Northwest Passage to the sea.
Then how am I so different from the first men through this way?
Like them I left a saddened life, I threw it all away
To seek a northwest passage at the call of many men
Too far there but the road back home again
Ah, for just one time I would take the Northwest Passage
To find the hand of Franklin reaching for the Beaufort Sea
Tracing one warm line
Through a land so wild and savage
And make a northwest passage to the sea
Ah, for just one time
I will take the Northwest Passage
To find the Angel Franklin Bridge
For a boat or sea
Tracing one warm line
Through a land so wild and savage
And make a Northwest Passage
To the sea
