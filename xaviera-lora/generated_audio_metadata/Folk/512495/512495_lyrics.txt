Thy strong arms are around me love
My head is on thy breast
The words of comfort come from thee
My soul is not at rest
For I am but a startled thing
Nor can I ever be
Ought save a bird whose broken wing must fly away from thee
I cannot give to thee the love I gave so long ago
The love that came and struck me down amid the blinding snow
I can but give a sinking heart and weary eyes of pain
A faded mouth that cannot smile and may not laugh again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yet keep thine arms around me, love, until I drop to sleep
Then leave me be, saying no goodbye, lest I might fall and weep
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
