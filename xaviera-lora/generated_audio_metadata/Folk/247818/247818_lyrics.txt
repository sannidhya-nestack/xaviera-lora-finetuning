Oh, I know it's been said so much better than this
It's been whispered and rumored and wrapped up and hidden
It's been shown around town, it's come back home again
If I said it out loud, would you be glad that I did?
It's the way that "I love you" is said
We've been fighting and cursing and nursing our pain
Made each other feel small, gave each other the blame
Found our hearts in our throats, poured our tears down the drain
Still we lift each other up and get back in the game
Where the feel of "I love you" remains
Yours is a full heart but not too full for me
You've been letting me see deep inside
Why should redemption be too good for me?
You're what keeps me from wanting to hide, oh
Yours is a full heart, but not too full for me
You've been keeping it free from your bride
How can redemption be too damn good for me
You're what keeps me from wanting to hide
I know sometimes it's rough and just living's a fight
But would it kill you, would it kill me to believe it's alright?
Seeing you tender and tough, you've been shadow and light
I've heard all of your sounds and I still love the sight
So listen close, honey, let the music delight
It's the sound of "I love you"
The sound of "I love you" tonight
Oh oh oh oh oh
Na na na na na
