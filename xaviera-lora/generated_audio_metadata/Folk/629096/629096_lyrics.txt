I've been walking down a rocky road
Waiting for the light to show me the way
I've been listening for a heavenly voice
Meantime I've made my choice to stray
But Lord, Lord, Lord, I'm in the wilderness
Lord, Lord, Lord, I need a place to rest
Lord, Lord, Lord, I'm in the wilderness
I need a place to rest, take me home
I've been listening to the demon voice
Leading me far, far away
I've been sizzling in the summer sun
I need a cool stream to wash my face
But Lord, Lord, Lord, I'm in the wilderness
Lord, Lord, Lord, I need a place to rest
Lord, Lord, Lord, I'm in the wilderness
I need a place to rest
Take me home
Let me stay with you awhile
Let me stay and rest my weary bones
Take me home
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, I'm in the wilderness
Lord, Lord, Lord, I need a place to rest
Lord, Lord, Lord, I'm in the wilderness
I need a place to rest, take me home
Lord, Lord, Lord, I'm in the wilderness
Lord, Lord, Lord, I need a place to rest
Lord, Lord, Lord, I'm in the wilderness
I need a place to rest
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
