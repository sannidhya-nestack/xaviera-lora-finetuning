The enlisted men ride in the launch boat
The captain he rides in the barge
It's not that he goes any faster
He just wants us to know he's in charge
Singing Tur-A-Lide, Tur-A-Lide, Tur-Alide
Tur-A-Lide, Tur-Alide
Turtle eye, turtle eye, turtle eye
Turtle eye, turtle eye, turtle eye
The enlisted men eat in the mess hall
But the captain won't eat with that mob
Now it's not that he eats any better
He don't want us to know he's a swab
Singin' tur-lie, tur-lie, tur-lie
Tur-lie, tur-lie, ay
To rely, to rely, you're a lie
To rely, you're a lie, hey
The enlisted men sleep in their hammocks
Now the captain he sleeps in his bed
Now it's not that he sleeps any better
He's just twenty feet nearer the head
Singing tur-a-lay, tur-a-lay, tur-a-lay
Tur-a-lay, tur-a-lay
Tur-lie, tur-lie, tur-lie
Tur-lie, tur-lie, ay
Now everyone's heard of a turtle head
It's when a bowel movement draws nigh
Now if they're above you and they shout "Cardilou !"
You'll look right into the turtle's eye
Singing, "Turtle Eye, Turtle Eye, Turtle Eye"
Turtle Eye, Turtle Eye-ay, it's a
Turtle Eye, Turtle Eye, Turtle Eye
Turtle Eye, Turtle Eye-ay
Since the dawn of civilization
And the seas were conquered by man
The pirate has the reputation
Of buggerin' whatever he can
Singin' tur-o-ly, tur-o-ly, tur-o-lly
Tur-o-ly, tur-o-ly day
Thur-lur-li, thur-lur-li, thur-li
Thur-lur-li, thurr-lur-li, thur-li
