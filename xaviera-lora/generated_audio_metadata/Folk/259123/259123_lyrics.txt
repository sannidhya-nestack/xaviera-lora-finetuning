Landlubbers we were back then just working on the shore
A captain came to port one day and he promised more
Mermaids fair and strange he said at night you'll hear them sing
The booty's ours for taking men more riches than the king
I cursed that man I cursed my greed I knew not what I had
If I knew then what I know now I'd kept from going mad
And kept from walking the plank
Ho, ho, walkin' the plank
Ho, ho, ho, ho, walkin' the plank
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Walkin' the plank
(Woooo)
Our captain was a drunkard, he mostly stayed below
In a fortnight we were lost at sea and then began our woe
With rations low and tempers high, the scurvy made us bleed
The hull had sprung a leak which made the ship pitch to the lee
I lost my head and found my dagger, I began to yell
Let's mutiny men, bring me the captain, I'll send him to hell
And he'll be walking out blank
Ho, ho, walk in the plank
Ho, ho, ho, ho, walk in the plank
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Walk in the plank
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
The captain got the jump on me, his pistol to my head
"You'll pay for your misdeeds," he said, "soon you will be dead"
And now I'm walkin' the plank, ho, ho
Walkin' the plank, ho, ho, ho, ho
Walkin' the plank, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Walkin' the plank, ho, ho, ho, ho
