When you hear them bells go ding-a-ling-a-ling
All joining in sweetly you must sing
When the verse is through and the chorus all join in
There'll be a hot time in the old town tonight
Please oh please do not let me fall
You're all mine and I love you best of all
You must be my gal or I have no gal at all
There'll be a hot time in the old town tonight
When you hear them bells go ding-a-ling-a-ling
All join in as sweetly you must sing
When the verse is through and the chorus all join in
There'll be a hot time in the old town tonight
There'll be a hot time in the old town tonight
