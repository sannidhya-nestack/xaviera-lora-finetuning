I asked the sparrow, come fly with me
And I will sing a harmony
He only turned and flew away
Like the love I thought would always stay
Always stay
I walked onto the water's edge
And perched myself upon the ledge
Until I heard the heron cry
Has true love already passed you by
Passed you by
Sparrows sing your tune
The deeper the heart
The deeper the wound
Ah, deep is the wound
I ask the dove high in a tree
Come and alight a while on me
Even a bird in the hand
May not come upon command
Upon command
I asked the owl, so old and wise
Won't you give to me a sign
He only sang from the branch above
Beware to whom you give your love
Ah, give your love
Sparrows sing your tune
The deeper the heart
The deeper the wound
Ah, deeper the wound
Then sang the sparrow
Come fly with me
And I will sing
Harmony for the heart broken in two
Will grow to shine more bright and true
Bright and true
Sparrows sing your tune
The deeper the heart
The deeper the wound
The deeper the heart
The deeper the wound
Oh yeah
The deeper the wound
Ah
Deeper the wound
Ah
