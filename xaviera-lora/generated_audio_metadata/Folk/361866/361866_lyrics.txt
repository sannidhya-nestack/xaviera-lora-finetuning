He is the light of the world, let him light your way
He's the light of the world, invite him in, he will stay
he's the light of the world, let him light your way
He's the light of the world, invite him in
And he will stay
Now you think to yourself
What should I do?
I'm stuck in the middle
Deciding about you
Look around for somebody to help you
But it really is between you and him
he's the light of the world
Let him light your way
He's the light of the world
Invite him in
He will stay
he's the light of the world
Let him light your way
He's the light of the world
Invite him in
And he will stay
