Though my sails be torn and tattered
And the mast be turned about
Let the night wind chill me to my very soul
Though the spray might sting my eyes
And the stars no light provide
Give me just another morning light to hold
For I will not lie me down
This rain a-ragin'
No, I will not lie me down
In such a storm
And if this night be unblessed
I shall not take my rest until I reach
Though the only water left is but salt to wound my thirst
I will drink the rain that falls so steady down
Though night's blindness be my gift
And there be thieves upon my drift
I will thank the fog that shelters me along
For I will not lie me down, this rain a-ragin'
No, I will not lie me down, in such a storm
And if this night be unblest, I shall not take my rest
Until I reach another shore
Though my mates be drained and weary
And it seems their hopes are lost
There's no need for their bones on that blackened bottom
Though death waits just off the bow
We will not answer to him now
He shall stand to face the morning light without us
For I will not lie me down
This rain a-ragin', no, I will not lie me down in such a storm
And if this night be unblest, I shall not take my rest until I reach another shore
For I will not line it up (line it up)
This rain a-raging (oh)
I will not line it up (line it up in such a storm)
And if this night be unblessed
I shall not take my rest
Until I reach another shore
Until I reach
