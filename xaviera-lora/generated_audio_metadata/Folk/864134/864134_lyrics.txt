Seems our time has begun
The angel's bell has been rung
And so we have come
To stand and face the sun
Our light, light is bright
We're like stardust in the night
And so one might say
That we showed each other the way
And I never knew love before I met you
And now I can say that I know the way to that field
Out beyond all right and wrong
I'll meet you there and we'll greet the dawn
So your soul may be old
But there's more love to unfold
Our tales yet to be told
As we face the great unknown
And now that you're here
I can conquer all those fears
And so as above
Our below is filled with love
And I never knew love before I met you
And now I can say that I know the way to that field
Out beyond all right and wrong
I'll meet you there and we'll greet the dawn
