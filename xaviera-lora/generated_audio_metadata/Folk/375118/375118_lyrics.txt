What a fellowship, what a joy divine
Leaning on the everlasting arms
What a blessedness, what a peace is mine
Leaning on the everlasting arms
Leaning, leaning
Safe and secure from all alarms
Leaning, leaning
Leaning on the everlasting arms
What have I to dread, what have I to fear
Leaning on the everlasting arms
I have blessed peace with my Lord so near
Leaning on the everlasting arms
Leaning
Safe and secure from all alarms
Leaning, weaning, leaning on the everlasting arms
Leaning safe and secure from all alarms
Leaning, leaning, leaning on the everlasting arms
