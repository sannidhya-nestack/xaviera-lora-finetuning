Should all acquaintance be ot
And never brought to mind?
Should all acquaintance be ot
And old longsign?
For old longsign, my dear
For auld lang syne, we'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne
And surely you'll be of fine stuff
And surely I'll be mine
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For old Lang Syne
For old Lang Syne
For auld lang syne, my dear, for auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet for auld lang syne
