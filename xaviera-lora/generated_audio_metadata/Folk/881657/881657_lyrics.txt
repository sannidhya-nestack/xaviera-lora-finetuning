I'll hold on and I won't let go
No matter how far you climb
So I'll hold on and I hope you know, babe
That it's you and I this time
It's you and I this time
How many miles can a love song travel
If I sing it into the wind
How often must my longing for you wrestle
With time and the demons within
But don't doubt me, just let me show
That I'll hold on and I won't let go
No matter how far you climb
So I'll hold on and I hope you know, babe
That it's you and I this time
It's you and I this time
In whatever direction life carries you
I'll be there, your co-conspirator
In laughter and in tears
Never with intention to trap you anywhere
I'll just catch you if you fall and calm your fears
So don't doubt me, just let me show
That I'll hold on and I won't let go
No matter how far you climb
So I'll hold on and I hope you know, babe
That it's you and I this time
Yes, I'll hold on and I won't let go
No matter how far you climb
So I'll hold on and I hope you know, babe
That it's you and I this time
It's you and I this time
It's you and I this time
