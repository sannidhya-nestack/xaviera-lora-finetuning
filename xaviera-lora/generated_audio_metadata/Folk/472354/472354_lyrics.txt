Here's a little song called Patty Murphy, it's a good old classic
Well on the night that Patty Murphy died is a night I'll never et
Oh some of the boys got loaded drunk and they ain't been sober yet
As long as a bottle was passed around every man was feeling gay
Oh Leary came with his bagpipes, the music for to play
Oh that's how we showed our respects for Patty Murphy
That's how we showed our honour and our pride
We sang him a song and we danced with one another
Every glass in the house was full on the night Pat Murphy died
Hi diddle dum diddle diddle I'd um diddle dee diddle diddle I'd uh hey hey
Well, Mrs. Murphy sat in the corner pouring out her grief
And Kelly and his gang came out tearing down the streets
They went into the closet and a bottle of whiskey stole
They put it in with the corpse, "Gonna keep the whiskey cold !"
Oh, that's how we showed our respects for Paddy Murphy
That's how we showed our honour and our pride
We sang him a song and we danced with one another
Every glass in the house was full on the night Paddy Murphy died
I did it on the little light, on the little light, hey hey
'Round two o'clock in the morning after empty and the jug
Doyle lifts up the icebox lit to look at old Paddy's mug
We stopped the clock so Mrs. Murphy couldn't tell the time
At a quarter after two we still argued it was nine
Oh that's how we showed our respects for Paddy Murphy
That's how we showed our honour and our pride
We sang him a song and we danced with one another
Every glass in the house was full on the night Pat Murphy died
Hi diddy dum diddy diddle I dum diddy diddly diddle I die hey hey
I'm taking it up on the dance floor
We stopped the persons in G e Street outside some dance saloon
We all went in at six o'clock and staggered out at noon
We went into the graveyard so holy and sublime
We found out when we got there we left the corpse behind
Oh that's how we showed our respects for Paddy Murphy
That's how we showed our honour and our pride
We sang him a song and we danced with one another
Every glass in the house was full of a night bed for a feed-ide
Hi-di-di-dum-di-di-di-da-lide, um-di-di-di-di-di-da-lide-ide
On the night that Paddy Murphy died is a night I'll never et
Some of the boys got loaded drunk and they ain't been sober yet
As long as a bottle was passed around every man was feeling gay
Leary came with his bagpipes and music for the play
Oh that's how we showed our respects for Paddy Murphy
That's how we showed our honour and our pride
We sang him a song and we danced with one another
Every glass in the house was full on the night Pat Murphy died
I said every glass in the house was full on the night Pat Murphy died
Oh every glass in the house was full on the night Pat Murphy died
