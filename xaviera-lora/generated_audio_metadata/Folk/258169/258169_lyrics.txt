Sometimes I still miss you and I don't know what to do
I'm almost beside myself'cause I still can't hold you
And I've cried many days, many hours
I've cried so much, I fear that to this world I'm living in
I'm out of touch
I thought I would do fine, I thought I would mend my ways
Never thought those broken hours would turn to months and days
Life is funny sometimes, we don't see what's round the bend
Life is funny sometimes, rocky roads don't ever seem to end
But everybody says la la la la la la la la life is just that way
Hold on to your heart son for there'll be a better day
But they don't remember you, the things you do
The way you'd smile at me, no how can they remember you
The way I do and the love that set me free
Every day I wish that we could go to where we were
A diamond on the blanket in the sun
I hear those words and I do remember you
Even though I fear I won't one day
And I do remember you
And how I dreamt of loving you always
Now I cry, la la la, la la la, life can't be this way
God in heaven help me, but don't wipe my tears away
For I still love her, so what do you know
She was my everything and in my heart I fear
Without these tears she'll fade away
And I do remember you, even though I fear I won't one day
And I do remember you, and how I dreamt of loving you always
Now I cry la la la la la la la la life can't be this way
God in heaven help me but don't wipe my tears away
For I still love her so I do you know she was my everything
And in my heart I fear without these tears she'll just fade away
Oh, don't fade away
I'll remember you
And I'll remember you
You've made a way
I'll remember you
Don't fade away
Oh, don't fade away
