Well, I hope you won't mind my asking
But I'd sure like to know if it was true
The bartender said he saw you looking over at me
Well, if he was looking at me, baby, he was looking at you
I must admit you kind of caught my eye
As I walked in through the door
I couldn't figure if we had met somewhere before
But if I knew you a little I'd have liked to know you more
See I've only been here in town a couple weeks
And old Rick at the bar's about the only one that I know
And I sure could use a lady's company
See I've been too long without and I'm afraid it shows
So I hope you won't mind my asking
But I'd sure like to know if it was true
The bartender said he saw you looking over at me
What if he wasn't looking at me baby, he was looking at you
Mind if I grab me a chair there by your side
Well I can keep these old hands to myself
And I could go on for hours about the smile there in your eyes
But in the meantime order a beer and we'll toast your health
Well I hope I don't offend with my unusual ways
But it's a solitary life out on the road
And it's funny how you'll stand before a hundred other people
And yet you think you never did feel so alone
So I hope you won't mind my asking
But I'd sure like to know if it was true
The bartender said he saw you looking over at me
Well if he was looking at me baby, he was looking at you
Well, I hope I have not bored you with my tales
I know I'm not the world's most interesting man
But I could not help but notice when you offered me your hand
That you might be the kind of girl to understand
So I hope you won't mind my asking
But I'd surely love to know your name
And you can whisper mine tonight
When you've turned out all the lights
And wherever I am, baby, well, I'll do the same
