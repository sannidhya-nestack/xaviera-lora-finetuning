In the evening when you wake up next to me
Got a pain in your heart that just won't let you be
I was gonna wake up in the morning and do things right
Turn your darkness into light but I
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
So we're risin' to face another day
Tell me you cannot go on this way
Well I ain't got money, I got time
Got more love than the sun got shine
But I, I couldn't reach you
Who was on your line
I couldn't reach you
We both will rise
We both will rise
We both will rise
When I finally get my head on straight
You've been broken and you tell me it's too late
Well I ain't got style but I got soul
Got more light than the moon got glow
But I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
Who was on your line
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
I couldn't reach you
