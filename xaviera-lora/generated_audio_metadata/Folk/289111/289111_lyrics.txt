When the eagle flies up in the sky, it is a sight to see
But it almost always flies alone, it keeps no company
And even though it has a mate and they raise a family
It almost always flies alone,'cause that's how eagles be
The eagle and the crow, the eagle and the crow
One flies high up in the sky and the other it flies low
The eagle and the crow, the eagle and the crow
Neither one is good or bad just different you know
When the crow shows up and flies around there's always four or five
But they send a scout to check it out before the rest arrive
And they hunt their food and jump and play like one big family
And they like to fly together'cause that's just how crows be
The eagle and the crow, the eagle and the crow
One flies high up in the sky and the other it flies low
The eagle and the crow, the eagle and the crow
Neither one is good or bad just different you know
The great Spirit sent a blessing down upon them both
And the earth and sun and wind and rain helps them with their growth
And Spirit taught them so well that they act instinctively
And they know they have a purpose and they live it easily
The eagle and the crow, eagle and the crow
One flies high up in the sky and the other it flies low
The eagle and the crow, eagle and the crow
Neither one is good or bad just different you know
Neither one is good or bad, just different, you know
The eagle and the crow, the eagle and the crow
The eagle and the crow, the eagle and the crow
