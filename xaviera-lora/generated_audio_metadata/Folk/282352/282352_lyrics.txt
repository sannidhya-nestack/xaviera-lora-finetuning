As he walked out one morning fair
Heave away, haul away
There he met Miss Nancy Blair
We're bound for South Australia
Haul away, you rolling king
Heave away, haul away
Haul away, all you're missing
We're bound for South Australia
There's just one thing that grieves me mind
Heave away, haul away
To leave Miss Nancy Blair behind
We're bound for South Australia
Haul away, you rolling king
Heave away, haul away
Holloway, you'll hear me sing
We're bound for South Australia
I rung her all night, I rung her all day
Heave away, Holloway
I rung her before we sailed away
We're bound for South Australia
Holloway, you rolling king
Heave away, Holloway
Holloway, you'll hear me sing
We're bound for South Australia
I shook her up, I shook her down
Heave away, Holloway
I shook her round and round and round
We're bound for South Australia
Holloway, you rolling king
Heave away, haul away
Holloway, oh, hair missing
We're bound for South Australia
Miss Nancy Blair ain't come to harm
Heave away, haul away
Been seen at night on a new man's arm
We're bound for South Australia
Holloway, you rolling king
Heave away, haul away
Haul away, oh hear me sing
We're bound for South Australia
Oh when you wore the brown cape horn
Heave away, haul away
With your wish to God you'd never been born
We're bound for South Australia
Heave away, haul away
Haul away, you'll hear me sing
We're bound for South Australia
Haul away, you rolling king
Heave away, haul away
Haul away, you'll hear me sing
We're bound for South Australia
