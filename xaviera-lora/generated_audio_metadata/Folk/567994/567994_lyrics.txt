Sitting on the sofa watching a bad team movie
Everything is perfect inside a box when he says
Once upon a time you and I
I was yours and you were mine
But what happens outside the box
What happened to you
What happened to me
The truth is that
Nothing would really change
If we met again
Met again
Upon a time
You and I
I was yours and you were mine
