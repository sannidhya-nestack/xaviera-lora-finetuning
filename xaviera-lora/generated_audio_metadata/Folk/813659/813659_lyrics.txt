Tabletop wine, tabletop wine
Crate's gone ripe, hanging heavy on the vine
Rooster done crowed, telling me it's time
Time to make some tabletop wine
Tabletop wine, tabletop wine
Grapes have turned and it's a mighty good sign
Better grab your pail, pick'em all in time
Time to make some tabletop wine
I'm startin' up my truck, head down to Santa Rosa
Pick me up a hand or two
Gonna make a stop on the Russian river
And pickin' some flowers for you
Tabletop wine, tabletop wine
The vines go deep and it's a mighty fine line
Call it a hunch but I think it's time
Time to make some tabletop wine
Tabletop wine, tabletop wine
Grapes gone ripe, hanging heavy on the vine
Rooster done crowed, telling me it's time
Time to make some tabletop wine
Pressin' and a-stompin' in the full moonlight
Workin'til the red runs true
We're blendin' it with love and it feels alright
Gonna steal a taste or two
Tabletop wine, tabletop wine
Grapes have turned and it's a mighty good sign
Better move your tail and pick'em all in time
Time to drink some tabletop wine
