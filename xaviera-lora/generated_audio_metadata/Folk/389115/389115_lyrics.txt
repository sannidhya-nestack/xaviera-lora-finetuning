We could take this setting sun
To its natural conclusion
Have a little bit of bedroom fun
Until we collapse from exhaustion
We could fall in love against our will
Kidney punch each other till we had our fill
And then look back with regret
Fight over the dining set
Wish that we had never met
But you know I did that all before
You know I did that all before
You know I did that all before
You know I did that all before
I met you
We could grab a coffee and sit
Impress each other with a clever way
Eat desserts and make suggestive moans
Talk about passion just to set the tone
We could fall into our usual roles
Think we understand each other's deepest souls
And then do the moth and flame
Realize we're not the same
Get our wings singed again
But you know I did that all before
You know I did that all before
You know I did that all before
You know I did that all before
I met you
We could turn each other into gods
Praise our luck and love against all odds
To peace
Then apart
We could scrape away our dirty pores
Till we bumped against our solid cores
And found ourselves exposed
Diametrically opposed
Oh but you know
I did that all before
You know I did that all before
You know I did that all before
You know I did that all before
You know I did that all before
You know I did that all before
You know I did that all before
You know I did that all before
I met you
