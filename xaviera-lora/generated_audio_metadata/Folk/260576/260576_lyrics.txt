Thump, thump, thump, thump
They say life has its ups and downs
That really now is quite profound
I like to push the capstan round
But it's pump me boys before we drown
Pump me boys, bump or dry
Down to hell and up to the sky
Bend your back and break your bones
We're just a thousand miles from home
Thump, thump, thump, thump
The ocean we all do adore
So come on lads, let's pump some more
Don't worry if you're stumpin' sore
I believe we've pumped this pump before
Pump me boys, pump'er dry
Down to hell and up to the sky
Bend your back and break your bones
We're just a thousand miles from home
The captain's daughter, I suppose, could be called an English rose
What would you think when I propose the fuck she gave to me or dose?
Bummy boys, pump her dry down to hell and up to the sky
Bend her back and break your bones, we're just a thousand miles from home
This rose well she did pluck me sore I've never felt so bad before
Thanks to the girl I did adore I believe I'll never pluck no more
Thump me boys, thump her dry Down to hell and up to the sky
Bend your back and break your bones We're just a thousand miles from home
Thump, thump, thump, thump
I call the doctor right away
To find out what he had to say
That's two pounds ten, get on your way
I'm sure the girl is in his pair
Thump me boys, thump me
Driving down to hell and up to the sky
Bend your back and break your bones
We're just a thousand miles from home
Thump, thump, thump, thump
There's so much water down below
Just how it got there I don't know
The old man says let's crawl and go
But I think we're bound for Davy Jones
Pump me boys, pump'er dry
Down to hell and up to the sky
Bend your back and break your bones
We're just a thousand miles from home
Pump me boys, pump'er dry
Down to hell and up to the sky
Bend your back and break your bones
We're just a thousand miles from home
Thumb, thumb, thumb, thumb, thumb
