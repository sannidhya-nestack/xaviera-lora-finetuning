You don't know how lucky you are
I know just how lucky I am
You wished upon a star
And I'd do it all over again
I have a new heart
I have a new start with you
You and Emmylou
Do you think the phone's gonna ring
I know the phone's gonna ring
Will you say sweet nothings to her
She'll say sweet something to me
The bloom on the rose
And nobody knows but you
You and Emmylou
Will it be Venice or Rome
No matter where we'll be home
Why is it as good as it seems
It's our bag of wishes and dreams
Seeing you being you
Seeing me being me
With you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You and Emmylou
You and Emmylou
You and Emmylou
You and Emmylou
You and Emmylou
You and Emmylou
