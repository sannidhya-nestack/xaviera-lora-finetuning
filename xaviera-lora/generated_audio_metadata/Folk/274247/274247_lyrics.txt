Charlie's coming in the night
Do your duty, firefight
Follow orders, stay alive
America, wrong or right
You've got to stand your ground
So freedom can exist
What can we learn
What can we learn from this
Green bamboo trees, mountain breezes
Week will overcome the strong
Right will overcome the wrong
Winds of change blow in the morning mist
What can we learn from this?
Can you see what they've done with our money and our sons
And they lie and tell us what this killin's for
Draft cards will burn, turn, turn, turn
We'll be studying war no more
When our brothers die
The people rise up and resist
What can we learn from this?
What can we learn from this?
Can you see what they've done
With our money and our sons
And they lie and tell us what this killing's worth
While the waters stay alive
America, we're all alright
You've got to stand your ground
So freedom can exist
What can we learn from this?
What can we learn from this?
What can we learn from this?
What can we learn from this?
What can we learn from this?
