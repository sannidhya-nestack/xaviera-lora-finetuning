It feels like I've known you my whole life
And you're the only one who knows my head to my toes
So stand by my side and be forever mine
the secret's out on our love
Can I borrow you?
For a lifetime or two, ooh
Let's make something beautiful
And let the sun shine in
And seal us with a kiss, ooh
Let's make something beautiful
The best parts of me you see them
And every little bit is yours
Every day and every night
You're the only single solitary thing on my mind
So let's wrap it up in a bow
Try and not spin it'round, see where it goes
Let's fall free, just you and just me
Can I borrow you?
For a lifetime or two, ooh
Let's make something beautiful
And let the sun shine in
And seal us with a kiss, ooh
Let's make something beautiful
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I love you (I love you)
I do (I do)
Oh yes, I do (Oh yes, I do)
I love you (I love you)
I do (I do)
I do (I do)
Can I borrow you?
For a lifetime or two, ooh
Let's make something beautiful
And let the sun shine in
And seal us with a kiss
Let's make something beautiful
Oh woah
Let's make something beautiful
Oh woah
Let's make something beautiful
