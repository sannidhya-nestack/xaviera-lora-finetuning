Don't claim to know
What will save us in our modern world
There's too much at stake
For hearts not to open
When so many people are dying while I sleep warm in bed
But I still have the same nightmare of the ocean so red
A line in the sand
Is that all that's between us
And the hour is late
For the branches of peace to be broken
And everything wants to go backwards
With the fire burning fast
When someone wants you to answer
For the sins we've put to rest
Will I live on the day
When we are without reason for
A son could be born
Without needlessly giving his life for
When so many people are dying while I sleep warm in bed
But I still have the same nightmare of the oceans all within
