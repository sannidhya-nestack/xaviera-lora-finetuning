Lord Nelson knew the perfect way to cure your Maldemere
And if you pay attention, a secret I will share
To any seasick sailor, he'd give this advice for free
If you're feeling seasick, sit underneath a tree
I'm marching inland from the shore
Over me shoulder, I'm carrying an oar
When someone asks me what
Is that funny thing you got?
Then I know I'll never go to sea no more, no more
Then I know I'll never go to sea no more
Columbus he set sail to find out if the world was round
He kept on sailing to the west until he ran aground
He thought he'd found the Indies but he'd found the USA
I know some navigators who can still do that today
I'm marching inland from the shore
Over me shoulder I'm carrying an oar
When someone asks me what is that funny thing you got
Then I know I'll never go to sea no more, no more
Then I know I'll never go to sea no more
Drake, he's in his hammock and a thousand miles away
Granville's revenge is at the bottom of the bay
Many's a famous sailor never came home from sea
So take my advice, Jack, come and follow me
I'm marching inland from the shore
Over each shoulder I'm carrying an oar
When someone asks me what is that funny thing you got
Then I know I'll never go to sea no more, no more
Then I know I'll never go to sea no more, no more
Sailors take a lesson from these men of high renown
When you leave the ocean, and it's time to settle down
Never cast your anchor less than ninety miles from the shore
There'd always be temptation to be out to sea once more (Hey!)
I'm marching inland from the shore
Over me shoulder I'm carrying an oar
When someone asks me what is that funny thing you got
Then I know I'll never go to sea no more, no more
Then I know I'll never go to sea no more, no more
Then I know I'll never go to sea no more
