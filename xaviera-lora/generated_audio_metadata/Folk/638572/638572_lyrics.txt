If I could number the days
Like the stars up in the sky
And I could count the ways
Life has kept me waiting
If I look back at all the times
That I was left high and dry
I'd see those so called friends of mine
Took more than they were giving
Can I see a show of hands
From those left standing
Can I see a show of hands
From those who walked through fire
Can I see a show of hands
From those who got left behind
Can I see a show of hands
From those who have survived
Tired of being stuck on all the days
Life didn't treat me fair
It might be a crying, crying shame
But I got no more time to waste
Gonna have my ups and downs
Gotta hold my head up high
Pick myself up off the ground
And have a little faith
Can I see your shoulder hands
From those left standing
Can I see a show of hands
From those who are through fire
Can I see a show of hands
From those that got left behind
Can I see a show of hands
From those who have survived
