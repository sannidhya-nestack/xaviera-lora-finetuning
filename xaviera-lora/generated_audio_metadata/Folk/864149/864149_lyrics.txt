I got nothing to do but make the lunch
Watch the rain maybe play a hunch
Nothing to do but wait around for you
I got nothing to do but clean the house
Check the mail maybe trap a mouse
Nothing to do but wait around for you
I heard the song say there's twenty million things to do
Twenty million things
I got nothing to do but wait around for you
I got nothing to do but mend the fence
Plant alibis for my defense
Nothing to do but wait around for you
I got nothing to do but think too much about little things and such and such
Nothing to do but wait around for you
I heard the song say there's twenty million things to do
There's twenty million things
But I've got nothing to do but wait around for you
I got nothing to do but my next chore
Nothing to do but wish for more
Nothing to do but I wish I was with you
So there's twenty million things
They're lined up at my door
There's twenty mil and you know that there'll be more
They say there's twenty million things to do
There's twenty million things
But I've got nothing to do
But wait around for you
