Listen to the birds sing
Every morning, every day
If you hear them you should praise
The maker of all great things
Listen to the birds sing
In the fall and spring
If you hear them you should praise
The maker of all great things
Listen to the birds sing when the night falls
The mockingbird does its thing
If you hear them be relieved
That you lived another day
Listen to the birds sing
Listen to the birds sing
