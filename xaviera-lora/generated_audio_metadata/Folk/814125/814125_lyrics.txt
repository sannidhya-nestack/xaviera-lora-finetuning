I dreamt I saw John Lennon
Alive like you and me
He was driving down the freeway
In a yellow limousine
With his suitcase right beside him
Filled with brand new songs to sing
Oh these are dreams that make me happy
And these are things I long to dream
Come on dream
Flowers drifting across the ocean
My boat moved on my dream's command
I saw the world's hungry children
On the shores without stretched hands
In the skies there came this cloud of dove
Dropping seed onto the sand
And from the seed they threw
The orchards grew and fed the starving throughout the land
As I dream
Come on and dream
You can dream
Come on and dream
You can dream about
Those orchards full
For a million years to come
Come on dream
Come on dream
He dreamt a dream of Martin Luther King in a train on Golden Track
He had piled all the hatred of the earth in the freight cars on the back
With his great big engine filled with coal
And those smokestacks billowed steam
Right then I knew as the whistle blew
This was a very special dream
Then he called up his army of angels
To fly them hard into the sun
In a blinding flash
With all hatred smashed
Peace had finally come
And I dreamed
Come on dream
Let's dream about this masterpiece
Painted perfect in the sky
Come on dream
Come on dream
Let's make a dream
A dream come true
Of peace for you and I
Come on dream
When I dreamt I saw John Lennon
