I'd take my eggs over medium honey
Can't face a plate so relentlessly sunny
That sounds funny but in this kitchen it's okay
And I love the smell of the coffee you're brewing
But even half a cup would run me to ruin
So nothing doing, just turn the cup, take it away
In this kitchen, you could serve her any day
I know you're itchin' to break some eggs and break away
The morning paper gets read over OJ
My horoscope hasn't changed from day to day
What did Anne say about this kitchen and this life?
Upon the spice rack the sage has gone missing
What can we learn if we can't learn to listen?
Reminiscing won't turn the past into today, no way
In this kitchen, I could bake a humble pie
Grow with ketchup, won't go down well still I must try
The traffic girl on the radio saying
Always a clear, there's no need for delaying
We can't be staying in this kitchen'til we die
And we're both itching to kiss this kitchen goodbye
