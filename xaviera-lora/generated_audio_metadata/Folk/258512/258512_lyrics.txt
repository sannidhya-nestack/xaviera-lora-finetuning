My name was Captain Kidd
As I sailed, as I sailed
My name was Captain Kidd
As I sailed
My name was Captain Kidd
God's laws I did forbid
And most wickedly I did
As I sailed, as I sailed
Most wickedly I did
As I sailed
I murdered William Moore as I sailed, as I sailed
I murdered William Moore as I sailed
I murdered William Moore and left him in his gore
It was thirty leagues from shore as I sailed, as I sailed
It was thirty leagues from shore as I sailed
Well I was being crueller still
As I sailed, as I sailed
I was being crueller still
As I sailed
And being crueller still
The gutter I did fill
With the precious blood that spilled
As I sailed, as I sailed
The precious blood did spill
As I sailed
I was sick and near to death
As I sailed, as I sailed
I was sick and near to death
As I sailed
I was sick and near to death
And vowed with my last breath
I would walk in wisdom's way
As I sailed, as I sailed
I would walk in wisdom's way
As I sailed
Well my repentance last did not
As I sailed, as I sailed, my repentance lasted not
As I sailed, my repentance lasted not
God's laws I soon ot, damnation is my lot
As I sailed, as I sailed, damnation is my lot
As I sailed
To execution dock I must go, I must go
To execution dock I must go
To execution dock
Lay my head upon the block
God's laws I will not mock
As I sailed, as I sailed
God's laws I will not mock
As I sailed
My name was Captain Kidd
As I sailed, as I sailed
My name was Captain Kidd
As I sailed
Name was Captain Kidd
God's laws I did forbid
And most wickedly I did
As I sailed, as I sailed
Most wickedly I did
As I sailed
