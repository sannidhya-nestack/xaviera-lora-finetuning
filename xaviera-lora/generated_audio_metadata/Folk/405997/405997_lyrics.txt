I remember warm, thin sight, long summer days and time we once shared
Now autumn leaves fall gently to the ground
Colours now fading, a sign of times past
Hold on to the springtime
Don't let this season end
When life is full of color
Let the sunlight shine
Life is a gift
Just living is not enough
In between the winter cold, love lies here still, sleeping at friend's door
I long to see the sun return
Melting the hardness and letting life in
Hold on to the springtime, don't let this season end
When life is full of color
Let the sunlight shine
Life is a gift, just living is not enough
So let the sunlight shine
Life is a gift, just living is not enough
