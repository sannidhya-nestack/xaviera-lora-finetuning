He left behind the crowds, the critical acclaim
The write-ups and reviews
He left behind his name
He brought his old guitar
His sweet and soulful voice
And he took to the road
To make another choice
Troubadour, Troubadour
Knowing somewhere there is so much more
He travelled'cross the sea
He travelled'cross the land
Just living by his ways, a guitar in his hands
He gave it all to faith and wrote a rhythm true
In the current of his songs where winds of chance blow through
The heart of a troubadour
Knowing in his soul there's so much more
You can hear him in the subway station
Streets of Paris or the train to Rome
Where he listens for a destination
Inspiration heard by him alone
He sings in poetry and allegory
Strumming on the steps of Amsterdam
Weaving chords into a gift of story
Grief and glory falling from his hands
His hands
Die die die die die die die die die die die die
Die die die die die die die die die die die die die
And in the passing crowd
Where he stands to perform
A few may stop and hear
Some things somehow transform
For some it's just a flesh
A moment I too wide
For summer's shining jewel
Revealed in passing by
The heart of a troubadour, troubadour
Knowing in his soul there's so much more
Troubadour
Finding in his journey so much more
Finding in his journey so much more
