Lynn says that there'll be rain on Tuesday
Buckets full before it's through
I say this time of year
The west wind blows
A daily gale makes me wonder
If I'll ever make it out
I'll take my box of chances
I'm gonna toss'em to the sky
Two years now
She's been sunk up on the bridge
We must not be so cavalier
She'll teach LS no two
They say before she's through
They know we lose a few most every year
I'll take my box of chances
I'm gonna toss'em to the sky
I'll never learn to use'em anyhow
I'll walk away and let'em fall for you
Walk away and let'em fall for you
I only want to let'em fall for you
And when it's quiet out on the tide
There'll be no doubt, no change, no yearning
We'll float there free from fears and
The will where all those years
They won't believe a thing remained
Lynn says so what about the winter
The same will come as come before
I say I'm thinking somewhere warm this time around
Can't stand when corners fill with leaves, you know
I'll take my box of chances
I'm gonna toss'em to the sky
I'll never learn to use'em anyhow
Walk away and let'em fall for you (walk away and let'em fall for you)
Walk away and let'em fall for you (walk away and let'em fall for you)
I only want to let'em fall for you
Lynn says that there'll be rain on Tuesday
Buckets full before it's through
