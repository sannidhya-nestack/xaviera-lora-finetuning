Stay, stay, stay, it'll be alright, it'll be alright
Just stay, stay, stay, it'll be alright, it'll be alright
Be alright
And you know it's true that it's just me and you
Since we were small way back in Montreal
So you know it's true that it's me and you
That it's me and you, me and you, me and you
Stay, stay, stay, it'll be alright, it'll be alright
Just stay, stay, stay, it'll be alright, it'll be alright
Be alright
Today is a big old fight
You know I'll make it right
I love you more than life
Want to make you my wife
And you know it's true
That it's just me and you
That it's me and you
That it's me and you
Me and you
Stay, stay, stay, it'll be alright, it'll be alright
Just stay, stay, stay, it'll be alright, it'll be alright, be alright
And you know it's true that it's just me and you
Since we were small way back in Montreal
So you know it's true
That it's me and you
That it's me and you
That it's me and you
Oh me and you
Stay, stay, stay, it'll be alright, it'll be alright
Just stay, stay, stay, it'll be alright, it'll be alright, be alright
Today is the big ole fight, you know I make it right
I love you more than life
Want to make you my wife
And you know it's true
