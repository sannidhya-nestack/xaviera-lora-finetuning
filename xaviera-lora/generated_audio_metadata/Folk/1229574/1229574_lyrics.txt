I don't know which way I was going
Somebody told me not to fear
And the tide just kept on flowing
And washed me up here
I heard the knock is in the action
The subtle flick of practice wrist
But it was simply a distraction
An ending with no twist
Walking the promenade
Glancing out to sea
I wonder where you are
And if you still believe
That we could have it all
The likes of you and me
Instead of these four walls
Painted royal garden green
They say that money comes to money
They say that all's well that ends well
But how can they say this isn't funny?
This heaven within hell
Show me the knack show me some action
Show me that flick of practiced wrist
Won't you give me a distraction
Just don't give away the twist
Walking the promenade
Glancing out to sea
I wonder where you are
And if you still believe
That we could have it all
The likes of you and me
Instead of these four walls
Painted royal garden green
Royal garden green, green
So I'll turn in my resignation
Leap from this ship before it sinks
Lord lead me please into temptation
Back from off the brink
Still don't know which way I am going
No point pretending not to fear
And the weather tide forever flowing
I will be anchored here
Walking the promenade
Glancing out to sea
I wonder where you are
And if you still believe
Then we could have it all
The likes of you and me
Instead of these four walls
Painted royal garden green
Green
Royal garden green
Green, royal garden, green, green, royal garden, green, green
