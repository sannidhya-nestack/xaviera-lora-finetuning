Joy, joy, nothing but joy
Better than Christmas and a brand new toy
Nothing they can do, nothing they can say
Gonna take this brand new joy away
You, you, there's nothing like you
To lift me up when I'm feeling blue
The way you smile, the way you talk
My knees grow weak when I see you are
Joy, joy to my heart
I'm gonna make it work with a fresh new start
There's nothing they can do, there's nothing they can say
Gonna take my brand new joy away
You, you, there's nothing like you
You make me smile when I'm feeling blue
All my troubles gonna melt away
When you lean in closer and I hear you say
Joy, joy to my song
Hope I'm not singing on way too long
Nothing they can do, there's nothing they can say
Gonna take this brand new joy away
You, you, you make me laugh
The way you smile and you shake that ass
All my troubles gonna melt away
When you lean in close and I hear you say
Joy, joy
Joy, joy
Joy, joy
