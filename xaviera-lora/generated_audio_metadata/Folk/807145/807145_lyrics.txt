Hide your face from thought
A place where you feel safe
Home again
The fear is finding places to hide
From things outside
Home again, again
Hide your face from the light
And breathe a place where you feel safe
Oh, the gun that fear is finding places to hide
From things outside
Home again, home again, again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
