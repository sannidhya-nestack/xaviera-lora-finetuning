Came of age in the Depression
Didn't have a cent
Gave his paper route and money to his folks
To help pay the rent
And he vowed back then
That when he grew up
He would never be poor again
No, he'd have money someday
Took a job at fourteen in the retail trade
And he saw right away there was money to be made
Went off to war for a while
And when he came home to stay
It was time to start making money today
Now he sits in his chair with a drink or two
Maybe more
After all, he had a long hard day working at the store
So his wife cooks and cleans for him
And his kids do all the chores
He deserves it, he says
He made money today
Somewhere on the way it took over his life
No more quality time for his kids and his wife
He'd rather spend his time making money today
As the years rolled on and his bank account grew
He was free to do whatever he wanted to
But he sat in his chair with a drink or two
'Cause he'd just as soon make more money today
Now his chair sits empty and worn with age
His Wall Street Journal open to the financial page
They buried him yesterday morning with a funeral parade
And he still made money today
Too bad he can't take it with him
Beyond the grave
