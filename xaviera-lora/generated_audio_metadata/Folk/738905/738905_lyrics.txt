Look at me in this one trying hard to be sincere
And look at you in fencing trousers and your finest sneer
We were so young and we were full of it
Fearless on the face of it and not much underneath
To hold us back from taking all the chances
Never looking in, never needing answers
Look at how we lost ourselves and found ourselves again
I pissed off to the USA while you went down to London
To find yourself
I guess I did the same
On different streets with different names
And different points of view
To fall into
Busy taking chances
Drinking it all in
Looking for the answers
Hello hello
Hello hello
Hello hello
We're back again
Then your parents leave you with no one to impress
Little children helping you to make sense of
This great big mess of headlines, deadlines, white lines
Buy the book, take your time and take a look at him
He looks a lot like you, it might be just as well
Look at her upon the pedestal
She's casting spells
They are so young and they are full of it
Fearless on the face of it
And innocence beneath
Pure and easy
Living in the moments
Drinking it all in
It's looking like the answer
Hello hello
Hello hello
Hello hello
We're back again
Hi-yi-yi
Hi-yi-yi
Hi-yi-yi
Hello hello
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
You make me happy when we share the love (Hello, hello)
Beautiful to hear we sing about what we don't know (Hello, hello)
You make me happy when we share the love (Hello, hello)
Beautiful to hear we talk about what we don't know (Hello, hello)
Beautiful to hear we talk about what we don't know (Hello, hello)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
