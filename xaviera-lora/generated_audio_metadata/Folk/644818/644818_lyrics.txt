There's always a road home, the only path I've known
There's always a road home, the only path that I've known
The path I took was never mine
Search for meaning everywhere I looked
The only thing that was true was always just you
There's always a road home
The only path I've known
Always a road home
The only path I've known
Why did I go
Because of the pain
I knew the lows, so hard to explain
Why did I say goodbye, I never knew why
There's always a road home
The only path I've known
There's always a road home
The only path I've known
The road is light, windy and dark
Cutting like a knife in full circle
Always back to you, always to you
Meaning everywhere I look
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There's always a road home, the only path I've known
Always a road home, the only path I've known
