Hello and hola to you Spanish ladies
Hello and hola to you ladies of Spain
For we have turned pirate have no use for England
So you know in a short time you'll see us again
We'll rant and we'll roar like doom pirate sailors
We'll rant and we'll roar all on the south seas
We'll never strike soundings in the channel of old England
For the gallows are closer than you may believe
Our captain was cruel, he starved us to nothing
He sat in his cabin and he ate like a hog
He threw our rations high over the rail
And so we threw him overboard to fish for our grog
We'll rant and we'll roar like doomed pirate sailors
We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas
We'll never strike soundings in the channel of old England
For the gallows are closer than you may believe
The first ship we sighted was called La Rocha
A French merchant vessel under naval guard
We took her so quickly the French begged for quarter
But the only thing given was blood to the tide
We'll rant and we'll roar like doomed pirate sailors
We'll rant and we'll roar
All on the salt seas
We'll never strike soundings in the channel of old England
For the gallows are commoser than you may believe
That French merchant vessel was laden with cargo
Furs, gems and gold, fruits of the new world
We divided our prizes into equal sizes
And then we set sail for the Tortuga Isles
We'll rant and we'll roar
Doom pirates, sailors will rant and will roar
All on the salt seas, we'll never strike soundings
In the channel of old England
For the gallows are closer than you may believe
The signal was given for our good ship to anchor
In a port more approving of pirates like we
Let's run to those taverns and the rooms with red lanterns
We'll only live once, you, the devil and me
We'll rant and we'll roar like doomed pirate sailors
We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas
We'll never strike soundings in the channel of old England
For the gallows are closer than you may believe
Let every man drink off of his full bumper
Let every man drink off of his full glass
To oceans of gore and fat prizes galore
And we'll drink to the health of each black-hearted lass
We'll rant and we'll roar like two pirate sailors
We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas
We'll never strike soundings in the channels of old England
For the gallows are closer than you may believe
