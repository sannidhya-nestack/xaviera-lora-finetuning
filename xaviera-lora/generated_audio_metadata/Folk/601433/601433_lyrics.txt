Come to our Father, come as you are
Homeless and starving, we've come from so far
We've seen the plagues of darkness, that's all that we've known
But now, God's children, we're never alone
We come to our father, our father
We sing this song together
We call on your name, sweet Jesus, sweet Jesus
You're the hero for our souls
We're slaves to this world, bitching to our lust
Looking for freedom, not someone to trust
Pushed down and broken, that's all that we've known
But now God's children were never alone
We come to our Father, our Father
We sing this song together
We call on your name, sweet Jesus, sweet Jesus
You're the hero for our souls
We come to our Father, our Father
We sing this song together
We call on your name, sweet Jesus
Sweet Jesus, you're the hero for our souls
Drifting through life, suffering and shame
Looking for something to numb all the pain
Nothing ever helps, that's all that we've known
But now, God's children were never alone
We come to our Father, our Father
We sing this song together
We call on your name, sweet Jesus, sweet Jesus
You're the hero for our souls
We come to our Father, our Father
We sing this song together
We call on your name, sweet Jesus, sweet Jesus
You're the hero for our souls
We come to our Father, our Father
We sing this song together
We call on your name, sweet Jesus, sweet Jesus
You're the hero, you're the hero, you're the hero for us all
