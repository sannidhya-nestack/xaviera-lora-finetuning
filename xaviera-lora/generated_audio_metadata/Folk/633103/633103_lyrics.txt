There is nothing left to lose
And I don't know what to choose
So don't tell me what
To do
I won't do what you want to
Don't remember who I am
There is nothing left to lose
And I don't
Know what to choose
So don't tell me what to do
I won't know that it's just you
Don't remember
Her hand
Don't remember her hand
I ot that we were friends
Don't remember her hand
I ot that we were friends
There is nothing left to lose
And I don't know what to choose
So don't tell me what
To do, oh, I won't do what you want to
Don't remember who I am
Don't remember who I am
I ot that we were friends
Don't remember who I am
I ot that we were friends
