In Canemara
River Eryth flows through time and tides
It meanders its way to sea
I was a girl
Born in a small harbor town
Where I found what the ocean gives free
There was a young lad
Open sky, blue eyes
We would wander the shore, he and I alone
At every moon tide
Kneeling down by my side
He would give me the gift of a stone
Beyond the green road
He'd gather me
The sea mist clouds low on the hills
A mind may drift growing old
Risk letting lifetimes unfold
Giving over to love lingering still
Still in Connemara
Rivers flow towards home
To the swirls and the swells and the girls
Garden of stars
Beyond the green road
He'd gather me stones
The seam is clouds
Love on the hills
A mind made drift
Growing old
Risk letting lifetimes unfold
Given over to love lingering still
In Connemara rivers flow towards home
To the sliding tomorrow
To the swirls and the swells and a girl's garden of stones
