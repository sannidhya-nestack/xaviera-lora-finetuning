I always thought that the path was the way that you go
But I figured out that the path is built off what you chose
And I cannot help but feel great when it all lined up perfectly straight and I know now it was all worth the wait
So take my hand and we'll go for a ride
All the worst things are just all in your mind
And it's all said and done
They end up as the best parts of your life
Feels like I finally got to the end of the road
And finally feel like I got everything that I'm owed
It's bittersweet just like everything else that we know
And being on top of the world feels just like how it's told
And I cannot help but feel great when it all lined up perfectly straight and I
Know now it was all worth the wait
(It was all worth the wait)
So take my hand and we'll go for a ride
All the worst things are just all in your mind
And when it's all said and done
They end up as the best parts of your life
It's just all in your mind
It's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
Thank God for all of the pain
And all the times you were going insane
Say there's nothing worth as much as you overcame
So take my hand and we'll go for a ride
All the worst things are just all in your mind
And when it's all said and done
They end up as the best parts of your life
