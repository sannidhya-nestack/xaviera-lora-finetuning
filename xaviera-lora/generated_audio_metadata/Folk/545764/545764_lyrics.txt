In he comes, to sell his combs
Man with a half nose and visible bones
Stands at the window and waits for your time
As if by being there he's committed a crime
You open the fridge and you look down inside
You haven't got time and you're not in the mood
To talk to this gentleman come from afar
To see if you might want a few ice cream bars
Hey ice cream man, ice cream man
A business is slow and you ain't got the dough
Wish that he'd get in his ice van and go
But he stands there waiting for you to say yes
To a ten penny ice pop which he sells for less
And the other ice cream men have now come and gone
You listen in silence and you turn the light on
You don't really need any ice cream right now
But you'll let him yap her on for the time being anyhow
Hey Ice Cream Man, Ice Cream Man
The engine is running outside on the curb
It stands in a grey Dunstor's shirt, unperturbed
The summer evening outside is now turning grey
He wished that this phantom would just go away
Oh he stands there even when you turn the lights off
As if waiting for something he gives a slight cough
Some customers come in to get cigarettes
Down to the bingo hall to place their bets
I'm the ice cream man, ice cream man
And finally you're given
How much is the price
I'll give you a pound off a box of Chuck Ice
So you give him the money and off then he goes
To the next destination his ice cream van blows
Ah the Ice Cream Man
Ice Cream Man
The Ice Cream Man
The ice cream man, ah, the ice cream man, ice cream man
