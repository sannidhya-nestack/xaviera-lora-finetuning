The winter is gone in your soul
And your heart will carry you home
The winter is gone
In your soul
And your heart will carry you home
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, you're just gone
In your soul
In your heart
Look at it all
The rain has gone
In your soul
And your heart will never carry you home
Free, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
