Well it's all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog
It's all for me beer and tobacco
You see I spent all me tin on the lassies drinkin' gin
Now far across the western ocean I must wander
Well I am a wandering lad and my story is so sad
For my whole life has been a blunder
You see I spent all me brass in the bottom of a glass
Now far across the western ocean I must wander
it's all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog
It's all for me beer and tobacco
Well I spent all me tin on the lassies drink and gin
Now far across the western ocean I must wander
Oh where are me boots, me noggin noggin boots
They're gone for the beer and tobacco
You see the heels they were worn out
And the toes were kicked about
And the souls were looking out for better weather
Cause it's all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog
It's all for me beer and tobacco
You see I spent all me loot
In the house of ill repute
And I think that I will go back there tomorrow
Oh where is me bed
Me squeakin' squeakin' bed
It's gone for the beer and tobacco
You see I traded to a whore
For the sheets were stained and tore
And the springs were looking out for better weather
it's all for me grog
Me jolly jolly grog
It's all for me beer and tobacco
You see I spent all me dough
On the last seas don't you know
Now far across the western ocean I must wander
Oh where's my guitar
My electric guitar
It's gone for the beer and tobacco
You see I sold to a pawn shop
For those malted barley hops
I can always sing a drunken acapella
it's all for me grog
Me jolly jolly grog
It's all for me beer and tobacco
You see I spent all me tin on the lassies drinkin' gin
Now far across the western ocean I must wander
Oh it's all for me grog me jolly jolly grog
It's all for me beer and tobacco
You see I spent all me tin on the lassies drinkin' gin
Now far across the western ocean I must wander
