Were you sitting on the sidelines, were you really in the fight?
Helping people raise their voices all together, black and white
Were you preaching civil rights
Teachin' door to door in Mississippi in that summer of'64
Did we learn from Mississippi when hatred burns today?
Can we keep that dream of mountains from ever fading away?
It's been thirty years and counting, but that watch ain't over yet
Oh freedom, let'em know we won't et
Oh freedom, oh freedom, oh freedom over me
And before I'd be a slave, I'd be buried in my grave
And go home to my Lord and be free
Did we learn from Mississippi when hatred burns today?
Can we keep that dream of mine that once forever fade away?
It's been thirty years and counting, but that march ain't over yet
Oh freedom, that I know we won't et
Oh freedom, oh freedom, oh freedom over me
And before I'd be a slave, I'd be buried in my grave
And go home to my Lord
And be free
And before I'd be a slave
I'd be buried in my grave
And go home to my Lord and be free
