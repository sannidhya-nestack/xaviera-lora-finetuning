When first I landed in Liverpool I went upon a spree
Me money alas I spent it fast got drunk as drunk could be
But then me money was all gone'twas then I wanted more
But a man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more
Once more boys once more
Go to sea once more
And a man must be blind to make up his mind
To go to sea once more
Well, I spent a night with Angeline, too drunk to roll in bed
Me watch was new, me money too, and the morning with them she'd fled
And as I walked the streets about the whores they all did roar
There goes Jack Spratt, the poor sailor lad, he must go to sea once more
Once more boys, once more
Go to sea once more
There goes Jack Sprat, the poor sailor lad
He must go to sea once more
And as I walked the streets about I met with Robert Brown
I asked him for to take me on and he looked at me with a frown
He said last time you was paid off with me you cut no score
But I'll give you a chance and I'll take your advance and I'll send you to sea once more
Once more boys once more
Go to sea once more
But I'll give you a chance and I'll take your advance
And I'll send you to sea once more
He shipped me on board of a whaling ship
Bound for the Arctic Sea
Where the cold winds blow through frost and snow
And Jamaica rum would freeze
But worst to bear, I'd no hard weather gear
For I'd spent all my money on shore
then that I wished that I was dead
And could go to sea no more
No more boys, no more
Go to sea no more
then that I wished that I was dead and could go to sea no more
So come all you porcey-faring men who listen to me song
When you come off them long trips I'll have you not go wrong
Take my advice drink no strong drink
Don't go sleeping with them whores
Get married instead, spend all night in bed
And go to sea no more
No more, boys, no more
Go to sea no more
Get married instead, spend all night in bed
And go to sea no more
