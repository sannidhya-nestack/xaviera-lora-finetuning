Some days things they just get to me
I could come up with a million reasons why
To vent all the anger inside of me
And somehow be justified
But there comes a time when I feel comfort there
I never did try to abide
By all the dealings of dishonesty
All the people I despise
And when all's said and done
There's two adventures in life
And here's to beauty and the pain
And each one has a ride
Oh, just wanna hear you say
Oh, just wanna hear you say anything
"Kindly, sir, might I ask of you?"
Or did it all go wrong?
Could it be you were far too young?
Taken by a song, you said
Son, there's a song in everything you hear
In the wind rustling leaves
In the feel of your lover's touch
In the mountain, in the sea
In all the scars of the universe
And every living being
Will only you need believe
Oh, just wanna hear you say
Just wanna hear you say anything
