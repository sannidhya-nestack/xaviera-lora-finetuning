I wonder what you'd say
If I should shake you oh so softly
Wake you from your slumber just to say
That I need you here
That I want to hold you now and always
That I love you dear well I don't know
I wouldn't wanna wake you, I don't know
I wouldn't wanna have you say goodbye
And I wonder what you do
If I should walk into the kitchen
Start a pot of coffee, fry some eggs
Maybe a little bacon
And put it on a silver platter
Laid by your head, well I don't know
I wouldn't want to wake you, I don't know
And I wouldn't want to have you say goodbye
I wouldn't wanna have you say goodbye
Now I wonder what you'd choose
Would you prefer to go on sleepin'
Or have me gently wake you with a kiss
Perhaps a few caresses
And a whisper in your ear
Other things I'd like to do, well I don't know
I wouldn't want to wake you, I don't know
I wouldn't want to have you say goodbye
I wouldn't wanna have you say goodbye
Mmm, I wouldn't wanna have you
I never wanna have you say
I never wanna have you say goodbye
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
