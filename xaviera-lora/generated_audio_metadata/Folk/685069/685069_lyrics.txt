After the thrill is gone
When love comes to an end
And I'm no longer a pawn
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone
Remembering fresh and alive
Didn't even need to try
And I knew that you could see
Just what you meant to me
Just what you meant to me
After the thrill is gone
Once lovers now friends
Like night is to the dawn
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone
Nights are cold and dark
Your touch now has no spark
The thrill has become a chill
We just have lost the will
We just have lost the will
After the thrill is gone
When love comes to an end
And I'm no longer a pawn
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone
Only the memories remain
Of love and lust and pain
Love has happened before
Only to walk on out the door
Only to walk on out the door
After the thrill is gone
Once lovers, now friends
Like night is to the dawn
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone
Days of Christmas and New Years
Once fun, now only bring tears
Birthdays and Valentine's days
No more as we just lost our way
No more as we just lost our way
After the thrill is gone
When love comes to an end
And I'm no longer a pawn
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone
