We're traveling on this train across this land of ours
Let's hope this engine makes it through the rain again
Grand Central Station is behind us many miles
Wondering what is just around the bend
Cause we have to see what's out here
This country is divine
So many mysteries deep inside
We know we'll end up somewhere, adventure by design
Never sure what's next before us, hoping that the winds adore us
We're traveling on this train through Appalachian skies
The sunset tucks the mountains down for certain sleep
The clouds are dancing, are they angels in disguise?
For this I pray the Lord my soul to keep
And we have to see what's out here before we settle down
Our little town can't stretch this far
We know we'll end up somewhere, a sweet and scary sound
Never sure what's next before us, hoping that the winds adore us
We're driving on this train to San Francisco Bay
I love you for your sense of curiosity
Just let the moment keep your worries far away
Just rolling down these aimless tracks with me
And we had to see what's out here
And now we know it's right
Let's go back to the town we know
We'll never lose the memories, our journeys and the night
This train has made us stronger, don't feel the need to wander
On this train I'll sleep with you tonight
