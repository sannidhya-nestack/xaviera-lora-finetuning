They are talking, talking
But I don't hear a sound
And they are calling, calling
But I won't turn around
They send me warnings, warnings
But they won't slow me down
Because I'm going, going
Nobody can stop me now
I'm on my way
And the sun is my guide, I'm on my way
My guitar by my side, I'm on my way
I got a song in my mind, I'm on my way
And it feels so good to say, I'm on my way
They are screaming, screaming
all they do is fight
They are running, running
And they have no place to hide
They're counting money, money
They don't know what to buy
You see I'm going, going
And this is my goodbye
I'm on my way
And the sun is my guide
I'm on my way
My ukulele by my side
I'm on my way
I got a dream in my mind
I'm on my way
And I feel so good today
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
And the sun is my guide
I'm on my way
My ukulele by my side
I'm on my way
I got a song in my mind
I'm on my way
And it feels so good to say
I'm on my way
