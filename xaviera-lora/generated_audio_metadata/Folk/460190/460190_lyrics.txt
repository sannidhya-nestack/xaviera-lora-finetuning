Leaf-faced elf of spring has spoken
Leaving me like quaking aspen
Rooted deep but lightly shaking
In the buffered breeze
She brings light and flights of fancy
Stolen from the god of dance
She flits and flies before my eyes
And kisses all she sees
Toad and swallow, rose and weed
Know the green girl's every deed
On April wings, at blazing speed
The green girl comes to me
Green girl tiptoes across my lawn, lifts the summer sun beyond
She stutters in the waking wind and shakes the berry vine
She of wine and she of sorrow, she of lovers in the meadow
She who promises tomorrow's pleasures we will find
Toad and swallow, rose and weed
Know the green girl's every deed
She makes the sap vein pine tree bleed
As she comes to me
There is nothing I can't teach her
Burst like bubbles if I touch her
Playful star, I only see her when I look away
Braiding vines of twining creeper
Blissful peaceful promise keeper
Bringing dreams to every sleeper
Finding love someday
Toad and swallow, rose and weed
Know the green girl's every deed
In every shoot and every seed
The green girl comes to me
The green girl comes to me
