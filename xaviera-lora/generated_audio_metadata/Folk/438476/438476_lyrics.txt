I'm just rushing down the road and I got some joker on the phone
Telling me my mortgage is late, here's the middle right now
I got tequila on my mind, though my bills are way behind
Some tell me it's all just fate, it's the middle right now
And we'll reach for the top but they'll kick us down one notch
To the middle right now
Work our fingers to the bone but we'll know we're not alone in the middle right now
So they tell me not to stress
While they criticize my dress
And my buttons they all press
In the middle right now
Everyone's just getting by
Half of them are getting high
While we all just wanna fly
That's the middle right now
And we'll reach for the top
But they'll kick us down one notch
To the middle right now
Work our fingers to the bone
But we'll know we're not alone
In the middle right now
Wee-ee-ee-ee-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Wee-ee-ee-ee-na-na-na
And it's all just the same that there's no one left to blame
So we'll learn to live again in the middle right now
And we'll live within our means with those other kings and queens
We'll be cleansed of our sin in the middle right now
And we'll reach for the top but they'll kick us down one notch to the middle right now
Work our fingers to the bone but we'll know we're not alone in the middle right now
I'm about to say, "Wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-na-na-na-na-na-na"
"Wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-na-na"
Say, "Wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-na-na-na-na-na"
"Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na"
(Humming)
Hands will reach for the top but they'll kick us down one notch to the middle right now
Work our fingers to the bone but we'll know we're not alone in the middle right now
Everyone's just gettin' by
While we all just wanna fly
That's the middle right now
Ooh, I said, we, we, we, we, we, we
