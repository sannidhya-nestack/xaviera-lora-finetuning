We met at the bowling club last night
I was waiting for you and it went cold
There were many well dressed strangers
They were all hiding in the backyard
Oh, it's gonna wait in a yellow suit
It's gonna wait for me in a yellow suit
It's gonna wait for me in a yellow suit
We sat there for a while
Looking without talking
Then we drove so far
In the middle of nowhere
Who's gonna wait in a yellow suit?
Who's gonna wait for me in a yellow suit?
Who's gonna wait for me in a yellow suit
Oh, she got away in a yellow suit
She got away from me in a yellow suit
She got away from me in a yellow suit
Yellow shirt
