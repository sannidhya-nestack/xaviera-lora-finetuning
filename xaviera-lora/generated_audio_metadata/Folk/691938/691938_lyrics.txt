You might tell yourself someday
I'm tired of just trying
You might tell yourself someday
I don't love what I'm buying
You might try to get away
There's no use in hiding
There's no telling what you'll pay
While you're not deciding
Because your dreams won't go away
Don't let your colors turn to grey
Don't feel like you can't be yourself
Don't feel like you can't be yourself
Don't be shy, just share your wealth
Don't feel like you can't be yourself
There's a reason why we ache
It drives us together
And no, you're not a big mistake
You'll get things together
You know you've got to be yourself
Because your talent is your health
Get your head out of the sand
It's your duty this demand
Find a place that you can grow
Just like a river's got to flow
You've got to grow up into space
Don't disappear without trace
Because your dreams won't go away
Don't let your colors turn to grey
Don't feel like you can't be yourself
Don't feel like you can't be yourself
Don't be shy just share yourself
Just be yourself
You are my life, you are my life
You might tell yourself one day
I'm tired of just trying
