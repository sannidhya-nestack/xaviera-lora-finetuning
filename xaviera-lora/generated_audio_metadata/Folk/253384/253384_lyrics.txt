You aren't the memory
To hold you forever
And nothing temporary
Aw but sometimes
You just don't sever
Baby
He's your baby
That beautiful boy
So much he'll never know
The source of your joy
Now you just can't let him go
Baby
He's your baby
So easy to exist
In the drama of sorrow
Your emotions twist
Till you have no
Breath to borrow
Baby, he's your baby
Ah, there's so much pain
And so much sadness
You are out of your mind
Taken over by madness
The trick is
To find the will
To live again
You must live again
Baby
