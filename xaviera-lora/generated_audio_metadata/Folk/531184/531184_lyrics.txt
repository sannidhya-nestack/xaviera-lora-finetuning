Sitting alone with this letter of why
The writing is hard to decipher
The spelling's just wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
I twist and I turn just to see it her way
But nothing's okay when she tries to explain why she's gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Tell me something I don't know
Just for show the same
It's your fear, I'll move on when you've gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I'm so tired of lies and another love dies
As I read between the lines that hardly defines what went wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
You scream and you shout just to get it all out
Two words don't make sense so I won't take offense
Are you done? Done, done, done, done
Tell me something I don't know
Just for show let's sing
We're all here, it's your fear
Tell me something I don't know
Just for show, let's save our story
We're all here, it's your fear
I'll move on when you've gone
This flutter of wild leaves me hanging to dry
I drown in your mess but you'll never confess what you've done
I don't easily crack but it's all coming back
Can't get up and run but you've already won since you're gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
'Cause you're gone, gone, gone, gone
Oh, you're gone, gone, gone, gone
Oh yeah you're gone
Oh you're gone
Now you're gone
