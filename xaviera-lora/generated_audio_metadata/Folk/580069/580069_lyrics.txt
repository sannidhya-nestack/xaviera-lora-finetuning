You know you can't have me
But I see your gaze
You touch me with your eyes
In so many ways
I try to approach you
But you vanish yet again
Don't keep doing this to me
You're the shadow on the wall, you'll keep haunting my dreams
I can't take much more, everything is not what it seems
Will you just disappear, or just walk through the door?
Goodbye phantom
You follow me places
Where you know I will be
It's tormenting just to see
That you're looking at me
I try to approach you
But you vanish yet again
Don't keep doing this to me
You're the shadow on the wall
You keep haunting my dreams
I can't take much more
Everything is not what it seems
Will you just disappear?
Or just walk through the door?
I try to approach you, but you vanish yet again
Don't keep doing this, no
You're the shadow on the wall
You keep haunting my dreams
I can't take much more
Everything is not what it seems
Will you just disappear?
Or just walk through the door?
Ooh ooh ooh
Goodbye phantom
