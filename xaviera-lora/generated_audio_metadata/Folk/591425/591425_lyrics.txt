Take this kiss upon the brow
And imparting from you now
Thus much let me avow
You are not wrong, Houdini
That my days have been a dream
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night or in a day
In a vision or in a
Is it there for the last gone
All that we see or see
Is but a dream within a dream
Pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa, pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-ta-ta-ta, pa-pa, pa-pa
I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore
And I hold within my hands
Grains of the golden sand
How few yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep
While I weep while I weep
Oh God can I not grasp them with a tighter grasp
Oh God can I not say
One from the pitiless way
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream within a dream
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Dream within a dream within a dream
Dream within a dream within a dream
Dream within a dream within a dream
Rewriting our dream within a dream
Rewriting our dream within a dream (We have a heart, we have a shoulders)
(Shut them up, just as we're dreaming)
(Straighten hands, just as we're fighting)
(We don't like to make decisions to stay in the dark)
(We're so stupid, why would they darken our plans?)
(We're with the lies, the lies, the lies)
(Skeletons, we're the monsters)
(We're the children, we're the children)
