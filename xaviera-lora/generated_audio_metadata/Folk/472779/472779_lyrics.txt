Dreams and promises surround me
They're everywhere, a vision of you in my mind's eye
I fall into a deep sea of memories
Struggle for breath as I try
I reach out to grasp the shadow of hope
To pull me to the surface to survive
I see a light that shines all around me
I'm so glad I'm alive
Tales from the unexpected
Tales from the other side
Tales from the unexpected
Keep tellin' me you're fine, tellin' me you're fine, you're fine, tellin' me you're fine, you're fine
I fail to see the reason for being with the greed and evil in this world
Poets and saints have written countless warning in the ones taken heed to their words
Tales from the unexpected
Tales from the other side
Tales from the unexpected
Keep telling me you're fine
Telling me you're fine
You're fine, telling me you're fine, you're fine
Tales from the unexpected
Tales from the other side
Tales from the unexpected
Keep telling me you're fine
Telling me you're fine
You're fine
Telling me you're fine
You're fine
Oh you're fine
You're telling me you're fine, you're fine, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
