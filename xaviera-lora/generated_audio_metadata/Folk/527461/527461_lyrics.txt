I wasn't afraid, I had it all arranged
Just how to say goodbye
I just walked away, it was easy to say
I barely gave it a thought
I didn't weep, I went right to sleep
Till I awoke all alone
'Til I awoke all alone
And I didn't know'til the dawn
You don't know what it means'til it's gone
I don't grow attached to things in the past
Things I don't need anymore
Old clothes and galoshes, I packed them in boxes
Old pictures of long, long ago
And memories of you, I packed them up too
Memories I thought all would fade
The moment that I turned away
And I thought the earth was under my feet
I thought a circle was always complete
Till one early morning proved I was wrong
You don't know what it means till it's gone
And I thought the earth was under my feet
I thought a circle was always complete
one early morning proved I was wrong
You don't know what it means'til it's gone
And I didn't know'til the dawn
You don't know what it means'til it's gone
