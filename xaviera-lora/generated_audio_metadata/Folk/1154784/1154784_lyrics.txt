And you said love, oh love is blind
And so I hope, I hope you don't mind
When they tell me that you don't look so fine
I tell them that love, oh love is blind
And when we dance, we dance without eyes
To left feet, to left thighs
And when you dwell on me, I start to unwind
Because our love, oh our love is blind
El amor, el amor es Diego
El amor, el amor es Diego
El amor, el amor, el amor, el amor es Diego
El amor, el amor es Diego
