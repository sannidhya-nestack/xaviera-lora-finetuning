I was a dancer then, under the moonlight
He was an angel, looking into my eyes
He wasn't just any man, so little did I know then
Just what it was to be, an old soul's deceive
Memories of late December
Haunt me still
You took away my pride
Though once I yearned
When the moon is high
I still shed a tear
On old souls deceived
He gave me shelter then, a cloak he found for me
He gave me stories in exchange for my heart
I told him everything, but I never knew his name
Oh what would become of all souls deceived
Memories of late December haunt me still
You took away my pride, for once I knew
When the moon is high, I still shed a tear
On all souls deceived
I was a beauty then, and I had my fill of men
But never the same as the man who carried my heart
And every now and then, I think of way back then
Back to the night of old
