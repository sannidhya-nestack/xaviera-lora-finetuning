She was a warm spring breeze in my way back when
She's still the woman of my dreams and I'm just an old boyfriend
I ran fast and free
Wilder than the wind
She said, "Lava, stay with me
But I'm just an old boyfriend"
Looking back now, I can see how
She loved me so
But my life was a blur and I just couldn't see
What lay down the road
Class reunion, she and her husband
Go slow dancing by
She gives me a little smile
Lays her head on his shoulder
And closes her eyes
She is an autumn breeze
Cool against my skin
Color fades from falling leaves
And I'm just an old boyfriend
I'm just an old boyfriend
