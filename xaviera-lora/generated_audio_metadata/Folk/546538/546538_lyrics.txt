And I'm back in Chicago for Christmas again
Just hearing the jazz and feeling the blues
I'm back to see her since I don't know when
I'm back in Chicago to play the same old dues
Wow, I'm back in Chicago at Christmas again
She's covered in silver bells and winter snow
There may be joy but it's tinged with sadness
Matched by the lake's chill as everybody knows
Be a while before there's warmth and rainbows, rainbows
Back in Chicago for the fall, God knows why
And I buttoned up my coat as I feel nothing but cold
It was never in my blood to totally say goodbye
So it's back to Chicago for Thanksgiving again
Back for Thanksgiving and October again
And October again
Splashed in colors of red and orange and yellow
People and cities alive in traditional thanks
Hearts are warm through the cold is below zero
Foreboding the worst to come of winter's chill, winter's chill
Back in Illinois for St. Valentine's Day again
Memories of Capone's massacre linger in the sky
I hear the sultry jazz and I'm feeling the blues
Lots of red hearts and cards to mix with the rye
So good to be back in Chicago again
Yeah, St. Valentine's Day in Chicago again
Valentine's makes her a place of pure red
With a charm of young love in the air
But they do not know what life has ahead
In this special place they call the Windy City
Back in Chicago for Christmas again
Just hearing the jazz and feeling the blues
I'm back to see her since I don't know when
Yeah, back to Chicago to pay the same old dues, wow
Back in Chicago at Christmas again
Back in Chicago at Christmas again
Back in Chicago
