Did you find your way?
It's better if you just stay with me
The sun sets for you
It blackens my mood
Again
Help me, I'm in trouble, water
Don't change me, I couldn't change you
I can't take much more
Eyes turned to gold
You whispered names you weren't told
To me
Try out this cloud
Use pictures not sounds
Let's be
Help me I'm in trouble water
Don't break me, I couldn't break you, I can't take much more
Of me, I'm in trouble water
Don't break me, I couldn't break you, I can't take much more
Tears start to fall on me, I'm in troubled water
Don't break me, I couldn't break you, I can't take much more
Tears start to fall
Help me, I'm in trouble, water
Don't break me, I couldn't break you, I can't take much more
Tears start to fall
