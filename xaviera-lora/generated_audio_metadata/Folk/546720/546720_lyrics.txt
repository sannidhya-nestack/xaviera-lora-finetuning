We put a band together, the year was'96
Played in bars around the town, tried to pick up chicks
But the beer it tasted funny, the crowds were just a bunch of
Whatever makes you tick, makes you tick
I met a girl called Nancy, I went back to her flat
We made love on her bed all night
On the floor cat sat
I said I best be going
If I leave you'll think I'm just a prick
No she said whatever makes you tick
Makes you tick
So I came back the next night
The next night and the next
Wrote those songs at your place
And left you feeling vexed
All the women dancing round
We played those songs so badly and so quick
Oh whatever makes you tick
Makes you tick
Back forty seven were the kings
We were the underlings
Their songs were on the radio
None of us could sing
Paddy Riley's on a Saturday night
Got to get there quick
Oh, water makes you tick, makes you tick
Oh, the new flippy is still there
In the rancid New York air
Our language is bad language
We don't fucking care
Nancy's all a-wise as she no longer wants her midnight kicks
Oh, whatever
Made her tick
Made her tick
You can't kill a dream so easily, it just won't let go
The women aren't so easy, we never made much dough
But that's the way it goes, the same old chords, the same old tricks
Oh whatever makes you tick, makes you tick
Yeah whatever makes you tick, makes you tick
