In the still of night I whisper your name
We had a love that could never be tamed
How I miss being lost in that loving embrace
All I have now are tears on my face
All I have now are tears on my face
I gave you my heart but you pushed me away
All I have now are memories of yesterday
Never thought love could hurt so much
Yet I still feel desire for one final touch

You are my best mistake
The sweetest pain I've known
We gave it everything
But now we're on our own
Now we're on our own
You are the best mistake and though you are gone

I cherished our love and though it's gone
In my soul it'll always live on
I know I can survive this heartbreak
Because you were my best mistake
You were my best mistake
You are my best mistake
The sweetest pain I've known
We gave it everything
But now we're on our own
Now we're on our own
I gave you my heart but you pushed me away
All I have now are memories of yesterday
Never thought love could hurt so much
Yet I still feel desire for one final touch
I still feel desire for one final touch
You are my best mistake
The sweetest pain I've known
We gave it everything
But now we're on our own
Now we're on our own
You are the best mistake
And though you are gone
Memories we'll live on
Now that we're on our own
That we're on our own
Now that we're on our own
Now that we're on our
