In this holy place I am me
I can think, I can sing, I can breathe
In this holy place I believe
In this holy, holy place
In this holy, holy place
In this holy place there is you
And you teach and you learn and you do
In this holy place you renew
In this holy, holy place
In this holy, holy place
In this holy home
In this holy, holy place
And then you and I become we
We create a community
And we sing in harmony
In this holy, holy place
In this holy, holy place
And we sing in harmony
In this holy, holy place
In this holy, holy place
