Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
For ye once was a true love of mine
Ask him to come and take my hand
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Upon the sea in foreign lands
And then he'll be a true love of mine
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Tell my love that I'll wed him there
And then he'll be the true love of mine
