Hester lies in dreamless sleep beneath Quinn Abbey
The only child of M. Henry MacDonald
Of Castle Bar
She left this life at Ballyline
The ninth day of October
Eighteen forty-eight
Twenty-eight years old
May the Lord have mercy on her soul
Hester may have been in love, she may have had a lover
Perhaps she gave her heart to a soldier lost in the war
And bore their only daughter here the ninth day of October
1848, 28 years old
May the Lord have mercy on our souls
The daughters of the world lie sleeping in the air
What we wouldn't do to save them
But who will remember
The one who's lying here
The Goddess
The Goddess
Hester lies in dreamless sleep
Beneath Quinn Abbey
The only child of God
Who needed saving
For everyone
She left this life at Ballyline
The ninth day of October
Eighteen forty eight
Twenty-eight years old
May the Lord have mercy on her soul
May the Lord have mercy on our souls
