And we all bleed the blood of humanity
And yet we separate to the point of insanity
Truly distant from one another
And trusting only family as sister or brother
And we belong to a race of equals
Within us all a trace of sequels
The vibration may be high and the vibration may be low
The level of ignorance, deep or shallow
Deep or shallow, raise up your head
Now look me straight in the eye
Earth walker now is not the time for sleeping
I as you were born to live love and rise
You were born to live, love and rise, yeah
Regardless the colour of your skin
And the countless times you were told you were different
In order for the world to spin
We all had to be here, written again
For it to begin
Raise up your head
Now look me straight in the eye
Earth walker now is not the time for sleeping
I as you were born to live love and rise
As you were born to live, love and rise
Love from our bodies and be
Love from our bodies and be
Love from our bodies and be
Simply be
Simply be
Simply be, yeah
