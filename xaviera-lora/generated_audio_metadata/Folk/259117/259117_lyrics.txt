A pirate sails from port to port, we don't have time to woo
We're here today, gone tomorrow, let's hurry up and screw
We love the women, those friendly willing women
The free and lusty women we meet by the sea
A pirate doesn't like to wait, he's not inclined to court
He'd like to have a pretty wench, but he'll take any sort
We love the women, those friendly willing women
The free and lusty women we meet by the sea
Now some girls are prim and proper
For a pirate they're no fun
A girl who's not uptight will treat you right
And make sure you get done
Now she doesn't want your money
And she doesn't want your ring
And if you treat her right
Hell, she'll do most anything
Now we love the women
Those friendly, willing women
Those free and lusty women
We meet by the sea
At sea for weeks or months on end we make it back to shore
Those girls of easy virtue soon have us feeling sore
Well there's never enough to go around for us to debauch
We'll have to wait our turn but till then we get to watch
For we love the women, those friendly willing women
Those free and lusty women we meet by the sea
Now when I am upon the deck and I am all alone
I think to myself, I'd like to have a home
With a special someone by my side and children all around
But here come me mates, so let's sing another round
We love the women, those friendly willing women
The free lusty women we meet by the sea
We love the women, those friendly, willing women (the women)
The three lusty women we meet by the sea
