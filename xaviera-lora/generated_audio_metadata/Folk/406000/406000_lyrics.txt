If you're heading for the good life
Then take me to where there is new life waiting
I want to feel the grass beneath my feet
I want to drink from water's crystal clear
I want to see perfection everywhere
I want to know you're endless
Love
If you're heading for the good life
Then take me to where my lost hope can be found
I want to feel the grass beneath my feet
I want to drink from water's crystal clear
I want to see your reflection everywhere
I wanna know your endless love
If you're heading for the good life
Then take me too
Where my tired soul can be restored
I want to feel the grass beneath my feet
I want to drink from waters crystal clear
I want to see perfection everywhere
I want to know your end there
Last love
