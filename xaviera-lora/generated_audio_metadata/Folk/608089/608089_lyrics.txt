To see the light is nice but what's the use in that
The storms I've lived through bring me right here where I'm at
The longest night could never blow the past away
The way I look tonight just really makes my day
And I'm dreaming
Oh I'm dreaming
What's good about us is what's good about our life
The time we spend together makes me feel alright
The tender memories come and feed my better side
I've been around the world and ruled you in my mind
And I'm dreaming
Yeah, I'm dreaming
What I know is that I've been here before
What I know is the world's an open door
What I've seen brings my heart there to sing
Where I've been is all I have to bring
And I'm dreaming
Oh, I'm dreaming
I feel a make up but I don't know what that means
I see a rambling road and builders of a dream
You see the roadblocks but you never know what's there
I've seen the road is clear and I'm telling you I care
And I'm dreaming
Oh yeah, I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming, yeah I'm dreaming, well I'm dreaming
