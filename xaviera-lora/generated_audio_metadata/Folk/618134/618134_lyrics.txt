Just give me something to believe in again
I don't care
I don't care
The world is a restless place
With all sorts of random wrongs and plights
Deep inside me I'm a crying stream of care and lost light
I don't care now
I don't care now
Just hold the tide and worry back from me
I don't care
The sadness in your eyes still takes the best of me
But you know sometimes, baby, I don't care
I don't care now
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
