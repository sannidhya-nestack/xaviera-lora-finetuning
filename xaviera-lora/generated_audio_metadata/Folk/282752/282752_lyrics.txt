Hey Sally, it's been years since I had the chance
To come back here to our hometown
I've been hanging out on the courthouse square
By the old memorial there
Reading names of local heroes
A few more years, a few more names
A few more tears cried at this place
And more prayers than you'll ever know
For memories carved in stone
Hey Sally, I just saw your daughter down in Arkansas
She's doing fine
She's got two dogs and a piece of land
Built a cabin with her own hands
Over three years in the summertime
She's got your eyes, she's got your steel
Takes on the world like it's no big deal
I've always loved her like my own
Like a promise carved in stone
The roads we chose to take
Took us separate ways
Before I had the chance to say, hey, hey, hey, Sally
You were the best big sister I could ever have
I missed you
How we'd walk down here on a summer night
Talking about the things we'd like to see and do
When we had the time
But that was then and now I stand
With two-inch letters beneath my head
Lieutenant Katherine Sally Jones
Forever carved in stone
Hey Sally, it's been years since I had the chance to come back here to our hometown
