She called you the prince of charm
Assured you shall cause no harm
And then in her gentle way
Took you in her arms
And while she was weaving strings
Impatiently ing rings
You told me you had to think
Far away from tears
Sometimes I feel like I'm a fading dream
Falls down alone and turns into a gleam
Now I know why it wasn't as it seemed
My love like sand was carried in the wind
And yet when the sun goes down
I sometimes still walk around
And trying to stay awake
Waiting with no sound
Sometimes I feel like I'm a fading dream
Falls down alone and turn into a queen
Now I know why it wasn't as it seemed
My love like sand was carried in the wind
Sometimes I feel like I'm a fading dream
Falls down alone and turn into a gleam
Now I know why it wasn't as it seemed
My love like sand was carried in the wind
