Take up the sheets, me hearties, and water the deck with brine
Now bend to the oars, you lousy whores, none is bigger than mine
Three old whores from Winnipeg were drinking a sherry wine
Says one of them to the others, none is bigger than mine
Now take up the sheets, me hearties, and water the deck with brine
Now bend to the oars, you lousie whores, none is bigger than mine
"You're a liar," said the other old whore for minds as big as the sea
The battleships sail in and out, they never bother to me
Oh, take up the sheets, sweet hearties, and water the deck with brine
Now bend to the orange, you lousy whores, none is bigger than mine
"You're a liar," said the last old whore for mines as big as the moon
The fleet sails in, the first of the year, they don't come out until June
"I'll take'em, the sheets, me hearties, and water the deck with brine
Now bend to the oars, you lousy whores, none is bigger than mine !"
You're both liars, said the first old whore I blushed to be so small
Now many a fleet have sailed on in and never come out at all
Take the sheets, me hearties, and water the deck with brine
Now bend in the orange, you lousy whores, none is bigger than mine
Now ladies, you're so tight, you must be pissing mist
Now I on the other hand won't feel a lover unless he uses his fist
Now take up the sheets, big hearties, and water the deck with brine
Now bend to the oars, you lousy oars, none is bigger than mine
"You're a liar," said the third old whore for minds as big as the air
Fists go in and fists go out, they never tickle a hair (oh)
"Take up the sheets, me hearties, and water the deck with brine
Now bend in the y, lousy whores, none is bigger than mine"
Now ladies, let me tell you
When I'm servicing my men
They strap an oar across their ass
To keep from falling in
Take up the sheets, me hearties
And water the deck with brine
Now bend to the oars, ye lousy whores
none is bigger than mine
Take up the sheets, me hearties
And water the deck with brine
Now bend to the oars, ye lousy whores
none is bigger than mine
Oh yeah
