Well I have hope and I have belief
And I carry love on my sleeve
Trust in me and trust in you
Walk with the light, search out your truth
Always remember and always remain
The flower of life with free will to change
We are the ones
To illuminate this world
We are the ones
To illuminate
To illuminate this world
We are the ones
To illuminate this world
Always remember
And always remind
The beacon of light with
The free will to change
