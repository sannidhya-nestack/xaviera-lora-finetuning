In a valley near a mill by a brook
I met a girl, fell in love and that was all it took
In a moment, in the blinking of an eye
I had a love that I'd keep'til the day I die
She would sing when the days did start
All the things that she kept in her heart
I didn't know what a love could be
I didn't know she could mean so many things
So many things to me
But oh, changes will come
And our lives come undone
And each night when I dream
She will insist that I lay
But oh, my heart belongs in springtime
A little grace, a little hope, a little fear
We are all in the dark, but when the time is near
So here am I, in an empty town
All alone, let the wheels of the world turn around
And every day and everywhere that I look
I see a girl in a valley by a brook
If only life, only time would allow
I'd bring her back to the town
Bring her back somehow
But oh, changes they come
Forcing us all to move on
And it seemed like when I dreamed
She still loved part of me
And so my heart was saying springtime
