Nobody wants to be alone
Nobody wants to be far from their phone
Nobody wants to be the last man alive
Nobody wants to have a drink with Clive
Nobody wishes to be ever lost at sea
Nobody wishes to be ever late for tea
With the Queen of England she starts at five
And nobody wants to have a drink with Clive
Nobody wants to be gathering no mass
We all want our lives to mean something right boss
To feel that we're here to live not just survive
But at the same time nobody wants to have a drink with Clive
He's an old shop robber who lives up the block
And when he gets drunk boys he sure can talk
He shuffles all day round town from dive to dive
And nobody wants to have a drink with Clive
He'll put you down and he'll put down your mother
Your father and your sister and even your big brother
His face is like marble, his eyes are like knives
Which is why nobody ever wants to share a drink with Clive
Sometimes when he's sober he's good for a laugh
He tells us a few things that really sound daft
And he's really quite a gentleman from the moment he arrives in the bar
And you know you just can't escape from having a drink with Clive
He's an old shop robber who lives up the block
And when he gets drunk boys he sure can talk
He shuffles all day round town from dive to dive
And nobody wants to have a drink with Clive
You're the only one it seems who'll give him the time
Otherwise he sits alone muttering in strange rhyme
I have locked him away in my look back archive
And I'm sure that still nobody wants to have a drink with Clive
If he's still alive
Yeah he's an old shop robber who lives up the block
And when he gets drunk boys he sure can talk
He shuffles all day round town from dive to dive
Yeah nobody wants to have a drink with Clive
Yeah nobody wants to have a drink with Clive
