I got my own patch of blue sky
With swallows soaring over me
Here in my own patch of blue sky
That only I can see
Sing a summer song
Winter has been here now for so long
I turn in my face to the sun
Everything is clear
Like the crystals casting rainbows'round my room
Bright as the midsummer moon
I got my own patch of blue sky
With swallows soaring over me
Here in my own patch of blue sky
That only I can see
Gotta get away
Take myself to some holiday
Throw open the windows again
Gonna start anew
Go out walking in the morning dew
See the rainbows in the rain
I'm gonna capture this moment
I'm gonna stow it away
When the winter winds blow
I can say
I got my own patch of blue sky
With swallows soaring over me
I'm gonna capture this moment
I'm gonna throw it away
And when the winter winds blow
I can say
I got my own patch of blue sky
With swallows soaring over me
Here in my own patches
Ooh, sky that only I can see
Sing a summer song
Winter has been here now for so long
I'm turning my face to the sun
