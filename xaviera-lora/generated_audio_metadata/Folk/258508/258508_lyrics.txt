Come aboard
Join the Mighty Sailor crew
Now you come aboard
And have yourself a pint of brew
Oh maybe three or four but come aboard
And join this Mighty Sailor crew
Now you come aboard and have yourself a pint of brew
A baby's beer for we'll sing and fight in drunken debauchery
We will together live the life that you always thought you'd be
And all you got to do, my mates, is come aboard
And join the Mighty Sailor crew
Now you come aboard
And have yourself a pint of brew
Or maybe three or four, but come aboard
And join this Mighty Sailor crew
Now you come aboard
And have yourself a pint of brew
Oh maybe three or four
We'll leave the shores for more adventuring
Come with me! (Yeah!)
See the sights that no man has ever seen
And all you got to do, my mates, is come aboard
And join the Mighty Sailor crew
Now you come aboard
And have yourself a pint of brew
Maybe three or four, but come aboard
And join this Mighty Sailor crew
Now you come aboard and have yourself a pint of brew
While maybe three or four will roam the fjords like Norsemen and Vikings did
We will together live as free men under no one's authority
And all you got to do, my mates, is come aboard
And join this mighty sailor crew
Now you come aboard
And have yourself a pint of brew
Or maybe three or four, but come aboard
And join this mighty sailor crew
Now you come aboard and have yourself a pint of brew
Maybe three or four but come aboard and join this mighty sailor crew
Now you come aboard and have yourself a pint of brew
Maybe three or four but come aboard
I'll be back, I'll be back
