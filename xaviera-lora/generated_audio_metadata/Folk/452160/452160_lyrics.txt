There's a few things that might stop the captain
From dropping another string down
Like the bell in the dead of the night
To turn the northwest around
We had pushed the lives apart to the ocean floor
And I made my way to the bridge
Seems the cruelest of waves had crashed back on the shore
Back where my Chelsea Dawn lives
And I wept in the arms of my brothers
The wind knocked me down to my knees
When I tried to be strong for my mother
The truth is I'm lost at sea
I heard the broken voice of my mother
She said Chelsea was taken today
I told her that she need say nothing more
I'm on my way, yeah
Said come hell and high water, I'll get there
I'll drift on a wing and a prayer
And I'll make it home to my sweet Chelsea dome
I'll swim if I've got to, I swear
And I wept in the arms of my brothers
The wind knocked me down to my knees
While I tried to be strong for my mother
The truth is I'm lost at sea
The good Captain Sagan been listening
He was an ethical man
He left those strings
And the profits they bring
To the ice jam
He said, "Wouldn't we were dispatching"
As the Northwestern said to the squall
Just one more night on the ocean, brother
We'll have you back to St. Paul
Once we drew close to the harbor
I rode the last league alone
I chartered a flight from Alaska
And made my way home
And we lived to rest my big sister
My best friend and my confidante
Knew it'd be me who'd be lost at sea
Just not with my sweet Chelsea dog
And I wept in the arms of my brothers
When you knocked me down to my knees
While I tried to be strong for my mother
The truth is I'm lost at sea
Yeah I wept in the arms of my brothers
When you knocked me down to my knees
While I tried to be strong for my mother
The trick is, I'm lost, let's see (we just begun) yeah, that's why I have you lost
While I'm aboard the Northwestern
Lost at sea, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why have you lost at sea?
While I'm aboard the Northwestern
Lost at sea, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's me
Lost at sea, yeah, that's me
