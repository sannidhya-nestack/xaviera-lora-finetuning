Leave your doubts and your fears
Don't try to hold them
This is what you've wanted all these years
But you just didn't know it
Heaven, hell, and then the seas were bought
And you feel that it's just the start
It's not a something but you just don't know
And there are a million different ways it could go
So you take a step and make your move
Because whatever it is you can't afford to lose
And it's never the right time
But it's always the right time
Leave your doubts and your fears
Don't try to hold them
It's what you've wanted all these years
But you just didn't know it
So you start to inch ahead
But it all feels uncertain
Little voices inside your head
Try to tell you it ain't worth it
Think of all you may not gain
If you let things stay the same
Heaven's never the right time
But it's always the right time
Leave your doubts and your fears
Don't try to hold them
Is what you've wanted all these years
But you just didn't know it
You've been wishing on the stars above
Now's your chance to show what you're made of
Leave your doubts and your fears
Don't try to hold them
It's what you wanted all these years
But you just didn't know it
Leave your doubts and your fears
Don't try to hold them
It's why you've wanted all these years
To just stand in no way
