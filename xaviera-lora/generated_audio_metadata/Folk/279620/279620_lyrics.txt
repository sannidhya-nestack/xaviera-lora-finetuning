et, ive the house
Where we lived is not looking very well
Here it stands an empty shell but the spirit is here
Don't you know it's all around
Precious she was don't cry
'Cause though it seems she went away
And you find it hard to take
Don't you know she's still here
Don't you know she's all around
I see her every time I close my eyes
I can't believe how much I need her
In my life (I'm off to blanket ride)
Don't you know she's all around (I'm off to wooden heaven)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Watch this scotch mist
You don't have the brains you were born with
Now it's time to get upstairs
Up the wooden hill for prayers
you know that you'll hear
Don't you know she's all around
I see her every time I close my eyes
I can't believe how much we need her in our lives (I love to let it get bad)
Don't you know she's all around (I wonder what I have)
Don't you know she's all around
On even Stevens all at odds
I'm all at sea I hope to God you're listening
The world ahead, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Up the wooden hill
Under covers
Up the wooden hill
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And the apples and pears, off the blanket fur
