Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Our ship set sail from Portsmouth town
Ro me hearties, heave ho
Was a gallant ship, both fore and aft
Now ro me hearties, heave ho
Romi Harji's heave-ho
Now bring her about with a heave and a ho now
Romi Harji's heave-ho
Was a pirate crew with the Captain Bold
Romi Harji's heave-ho
Sinking ships of silver and gold now
Romi Harji's heave-ho
Romi Harji's heave-ho
To Gala Barun so bring her about now
Romi Harji's heave-ho
With Captain Victor at the wheel
Romy Hartiseem, ho
We took our ships with shot and steel now
Romy Hartiseem, ho
Romy Hartiseem, ho
We'll point her bow into the gale boys
Romy Hartiseem, ho
We turned for ports, its golden shores
Ro me hearties ye ho
As we neared the rocks, the mainsail tore
Now ro me hearties ye ho
Ro me hearties ye ho
The gale is here, God save us all boys
Ro me hearties ye ho
We're done for boys, the pilots said
Ro me hearties ye ho
We're going down, we'll all be dead now
Ro me hearties ye ho
Romi Hartitibho
With the terrible crash she broke in two now
Romi Hartitibho
There's bones on the bottom as white as snow
Romi Hartitibho
They're in the embrace of Davy Jones now
Romi Hartitibho
Row me hearties, heave ho
This pirate crew are roost in hell now
Row me hearties, heave ho
Row me hearties, heave ho
