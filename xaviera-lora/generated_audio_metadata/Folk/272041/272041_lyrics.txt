One, two, three, four
Well I have seen the sunshine and I've seen the pouring rain
Driven through the mountains and upon the greatest plains
And everywhere I travel I always thought of you
And still I'm just beginning to learn to live with the pain of losing you
Engraved upon my mind is the day you caught my eye
You smiled at me so sweetly all that I could say was hi
My given name is Joseph though my friends all call me Jay
And I do believe I just might fall in love with you someday
Well you smiled again on hearing this and you whispered in my ear
That you had seen me coming in your dreams now for a year
And you leaned to me and pressed your lips upon my windburn brow
We began to make the plans to run away somehow
Well I have seen the sunshine and I've seen the pouring rain
Driven through the mountains and upon the greatest plains
And every day I travel I always thought of you
And still I'm just beginning to learn to live with the pain of losing you
That summer in the foothills, it was the greatest of my life
We talked about the kids we'd have and how you'd be my wife
The sparkle in your eyes shone brighter than the stars
When you told me that you loved me in the backseat of my daddy's car
But then upon one August night your daddy came to know
That we had planned it secretly to run away to Chicago
And he said no little girl of his would ever run away
With a city boy from Illinois before his dying day
Now I have seen the sunshine and I've seen the pouring rain
Written on the oceans and upon the fastest trains
Yes, I've done all the things that you and I, we said we'd do
And still I'm just beginning to learn to live with the pain of losing you
