Some day, somewhere, a glaring ray of morning
Will bridge the curtains of your laid-back eyes
Knockin' down brings a burdensome wall
Then you cry all the stupid fakin' acts of crying out yourself
Then you
Life is worth starting from today
Some day somewhere a glaring ray of morning
Will bridge the curtains of your laid back eyes
A knocking down brings a boredom storm
And then you'll cry all those stupid faces
I tell right out to sell
Then you realize life is worth starting from today
