Feel like a laundry on the clothesline
Has been dragging on the ground
Feel like a laundry on the clothesline
Has been dragging on the ground
I'd call someone to help me
But there ain't
No one around
I once was wet and clean
Out in the morning air
I once was wet and clean
Out in the morning air
But some birds flew overhead
And dropped something
That they could share
And the winds blew kinda hard
Knocked pieces of me down
The winds blew kinda hard
And knock pieces of me down
When my master come to get me
Well she, she just might wear a frown
But she'll pick me up real gentle
Wash away the dirt within
She'll pick me up real gentle
Wash away the dirt within
Then she'll hang me back on that clothesline
Let me try again
Feel like laundry on the clothesline
Has been dragging on the ground
Feel like laundry on the clothesline
Has been dragging on the ground
I'd call someone to help me
But there ain't
No one around
