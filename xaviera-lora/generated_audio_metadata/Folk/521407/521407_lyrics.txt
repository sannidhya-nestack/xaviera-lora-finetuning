Hail Yah-ho, boys
Let it go, boys
Bring her head round
And all together
Tell your whole voice
And let the cold voice
Say we go
To make a lake
What can we have
Wipe them inches
What can we for
Windy weather
Hail your old boys
Every inches
Sailing closer to Mingulay
Hail your old boys
And let her go, boys
Bring her big round
And all together
Oh hail your home, boys
And let her go, boys
Sailing home to me in good lay
Wives and sweethearts
On the hillside looking seaward
Through the meadow old man said go boys
And we'll land above
Hear the sun sets on Minger Lane
Oh, hail your old voice
And let her go, boys
Oh, bring her head'round
I know together
Oh hail your ho voice
Unless a gold voice
Sayin' ho
To Mingulay
When the wind is wild
With shouting and the waves mount
Ever higher, anxious eyes turn
At the sea world
To see us old boys
To mingulate
Oh hail your old boys
And let her go boys
Oh
And all together
Oh hail your old boys
And let her go boys
Say you know
So it's a mean year there
Heal your old voice
And let her go boys
Oh bring her head round
And all together
Oh heal your old voice
I'm left to go boys
Sailing home to Mingulay
Oh, sailing home to Mingulay
Oh, sailing home
To Minger Lake
Hail Yaho voice
Hail Yaho voice
Hail Yaho voice
