I never knew you at all
Oh I never knew you at all
Unaware of the coming fall
I just didn't know you at all
We once had a time of joy
A new love so full of hope
You a lawyer, me a cowboy
We laughed about Vegas just to elope
But I didn't realize I was walking a tightrope
I never knew you at all
I never knew you at all
Unaware of the coming fall
I just didn't know you at all
You were jetting around so much
Writing up big international deals
I just longed for the thrill of your touch
I didn't know just how well deception conceals
I only have time to think
As I eat a lone cold meal
Never knew you at all, never knew you at all
Unaware of the coming fall, just didn't know you at all
Your words still echo in my head
When you told of a new man
A salesman, very well read
She had to go, a new deal in Japan
And that was it, so many things left unsaid
No I never knew you at all
I never knew you at all
Unaware of the coming fall
Just didn't know you at all
I never knew you at all
I never knew you at all
Unaware of the coming fall
I just didn't know you at all
