We were so close
Now you're so far
You're so beautiful
Yes you are
Oh how I miss you
Yes I do
That's why I'm simply blue
You were an arrow
I was the bow
But I pulled back
And let you go
Oh, I still want you
Yes, I do
That's why I'm simply blue
Simply blue
For my Peggy Sue
I will never not think of you
Simply blue, my honey dew
You're the first girl I ever knew
All this pain I'm now going through
Has left me simply blue
We were so happy, now I'm so sad
Your sweet love, I once had
Oh, I still love you, yes I do
That's why I'm simply blue
That's why I'm simply blue
You've left me simply blue
Doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo
Do do do do do do
That's why I'm simply blue
