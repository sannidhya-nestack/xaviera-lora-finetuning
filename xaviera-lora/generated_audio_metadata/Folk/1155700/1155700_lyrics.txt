I just didn't know if I would find my way back
I'll continue on my own, growing slowly
Now I found myself within
I can't get you off of my mind
I've been wasting so much
I've been waiting for this
Time can't get you off of my mind
I've been wasting so much
I've been waiting for this time, ooh
Time, ooh
I just didn't know
If I would find my way back
I'll continue on my own, growing
Slowly
Now I found myself within
I
Can't get you off of my mind
I've been wasting so much
I've been waiting for this
Time
Can't get you off of my mind
I've been wasting so much
I've been waiting for this
Time, ooh
Time, ooh
I can't get you off of my mind
I've been wasting so much
I've been waiting for this time
Can't get you off of my mind
I've been wasting so much
I've been waiting for this
