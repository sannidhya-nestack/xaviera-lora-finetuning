Well, as fine a sight as ever you'd see
Ah hee ah ho, are you most done?
Is Liza Lee all on me knee?
Clear the track and let the bull jine run
To me hay riggah jig in a jaunting car
Ah hee ah ho, are you most done
Liza Lee all on me knee?
Clear the track and let the bull jine run
Now when I get home across the sea
Ah hee ah how are you most done?
Liza will you marry me?
Clear the track and let the bull jine run
To me hay riggah jig in a jaunting car
Ah hee ah how are you most done
Liza Lee all on my knee
Clear the track and let the bull jine run
I'll stay with you upon the shore
Ah hee ah ho, ah you most done
And go away to sea no more
Clear the track and let the bull-gine run
To me hay-rig a-jig in a jaunting car
Ah hee ah ho, ah you most done
Lies a leol on my knee
Clear the track and let the bull-gine run
When I gets back to Liverpool town
A-hee-ah-ho, are you most done?
I'll stand your whiskies all around
Clear the track and let the bull-gine run
To my hay-rig-a-jig in a jauntin' car
A-hee-ah-ho, are you most done?
Lies a Lee all on my knee
Clear the track and let the bull-gine run
