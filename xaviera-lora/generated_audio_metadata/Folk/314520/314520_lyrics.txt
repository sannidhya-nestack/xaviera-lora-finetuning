You used to be 39, now you're 30 old
You used to be a rolling stone, now you're getting mold
You're officially a has-been, at least that much is clear
You are 40 and it's all downhill from here
A fire truck was radioed to help put out your cake
The heat was so intense they had to throw it in the lake
When people say you're looking good you wish they were sincere
You are forty and it's all downhill from here
'Cause you are 40, beyond the shadow of a doubt
You've hit the big 4-0, your body's wearing out
You've climbed the highest mountain, now you're way beyond your prime
You are 40 and you're on that great decline
You've traded in your minivan for a brand new SUV
You're the reason they invented extra comfort jeans
You're way too old to look for work or start a new career
You are 40 and it's all downhill from here
You're packing on the cellulite
You've got a pig behind
Your biological clock is starting to unwind
Wrinkles, moles and liver spots are starting to appear
You are forty and it's all downhill from here
Cause you are forty
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
You've hit the big 4-0
Your body's wearing out
You've climbed the highest mountain
Now you're way beyond your prime
You are 40 and you're on that great deep line
'Cause you are 40
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
You've hit the big four-oh
Your body's wearing out
You've climbed that highest mountain
Now you're way beyond your prime
You are 40 and you're on that great decline
You are 40 and you're on that great decline
You are 40 and you're on that great decline
