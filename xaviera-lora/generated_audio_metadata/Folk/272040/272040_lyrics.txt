One, two, three, four
And Alabama, Alabama, it's hard to leave again
Feels so good to be back home here among my friends
And your red dirt and your white sands and your blue bayous
Made me who I am today and I'm wondering what's the use
And leaving because frankly I've come to understand
You can wander away from Perdido Bay but the bay sticks with a man
In Alabama, Alabama it's hard to leave you again
Feels so good to be back home
Here among my friends
Where the cold's the same hell and it never changes
I hope it never will
Let'em build their bridges and sell their souls
It'll be here still
it's lived through more than one hurricane
It even outlived old Paul
And it'll outlive me if I have my way, it'll outlive us all
I can't resist your guitar pickin'
And all those great old songs
So I'm hooded out, but I promise you this
I'll be back one of these days
One day I'll be back to stay
In an Alabama red dirt gray
I'm hooded out, but I promise you this
I'll be back one of these days
Someday I'll be back to stay in an Alabama red dirt grave
