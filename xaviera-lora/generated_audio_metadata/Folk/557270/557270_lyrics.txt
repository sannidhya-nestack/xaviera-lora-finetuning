I talked to Brian Wilson recently
Though in the middle of a perfect dream
I said it's great to hear how you finished Smile
After all the trouble it has been
Help me out, I need to know
I've got a strong conviction
Can't you tell me so and so
I need a look in your kitchen
He said make it a story and leave half of it out
Imagination fills in what it's all about
Give us a picture made of words and sound
It will stay in our minds like a merry-go-round
Kissed by your girlfriend or any other muse
Tell us about her in a twelve bar blues
Now I'm sitting right here at this perfect place
Pen and paper and a shady tree
Throwing words like dice around in my head until they make some sense to me
And I will not pull back or leave anything out
Cause don't you know what they say
The one thing that you'll be when you're gone
Remembered for what you gave away
He said make it a story and leave half of it out
Imagination fills in what it's all about
Give us a picture made of words and sound
It will stay in our minds like a merry-go-round
Kissed by your girlfriend or any other muse
Tell us about her in a twelve bar blues
He said make it a story and leave half of it out
Imagination fills in what it's all about
Give us a picture made of words and sound
It will stay in our minds like a merry-go-round
Kissed by your girlfriend or any other muse
Tell us about her in a twelve bar blues
