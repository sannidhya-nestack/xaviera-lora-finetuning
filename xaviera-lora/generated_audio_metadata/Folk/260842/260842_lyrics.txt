When I was a little lad, me mother often told me
Way hollow way, well hollow way, Joe
That if I did not kiss the girls, me lips would grow all moley
Way hollow way, well hollow way, Joe
Way hollow way, we're bound for better weather
Way hollow way, well hollow way, Joe
I sailed the seas for many years, not knowing what I was missing
We'll haul away, we'll haul away Joe
But then I got myself to shore and started in a kiss and told me
We'll haul away, we'll haul away Joe
We'll haul away, we're bound for better weather
We'll haul away, we'll haul away Joe
Though first I had a Spanish girl but she was daft and lazy
We haul away, we'll haul away Joe
Now I got an Irish girl out dammit drives me crazy, tell me
We haul away, we'll haul away Joe
We haul away, we're bound for better weather
We haul away, we'll haul away Joe
Well, Louis was the King of France before the Revolution
We'll haul away, we'll haul away Joe
Then he got his head chopped off which spoilt his constitution
We'll haul away, we'll haul away Joe
We'll haul away, we're bound for better weather
We'll haul away, we'll haul away Joe
We'll haul away, we'll haul away together
We'll haul away, we'll haul away Joe
