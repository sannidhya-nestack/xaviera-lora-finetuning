The silence falls
A window shut to conversation
The colour fades to grey
I can't back down
This moment it's already fleeting
It cradles away as it goes
And I know this part
I've seen how it plays out
All I can do is hold on
You say
Together we will fall
I say
Together we will rise above it all
You say we will crash and burn
I say we could choose to live and to never learn
This changing fate, it plays with my mind
It dances and taunts and then flees
And I close my eyes, reach out into the morning
The world stops and then spins again
I know this part
I've seen how it plays out
And all I can do is hold on
You say, together we will fall
I say
Together we will rise above it all
You say we will crash and burn
I say we could choose to live and to never learn
And every single time
I feel you slip away
I laugh and hold on
Oh hold on
You say together we will fall
I say
Together we will rise above it all
You say we will crash and burn
I say we could choose to live and to never learn
To never learn, to never learn
To never learn
