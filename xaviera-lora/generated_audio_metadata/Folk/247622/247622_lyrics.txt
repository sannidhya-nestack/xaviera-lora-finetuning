Michelle had a baby with the first man that said she was pretty
And she stayed at home with mom and dad
And worked at Wendy's, the first job she applied for
She never wanted more than what she had
And I've heard the stories
Of how my parents had to struggle
And somehow they got the ends to meet
And they stay together
They did it for Michelle and me
And happily they don't admit defeat
But I'm not like that, not that that's so bad
They say that life is tough and they say they've got enough
But I want more than enough
Is that asking for too much?
And my boyfriend Tommy, he's working at Joe's Auto Body
And he says he's happy fixing cars
And he makes good money, and sometimes he buys me something
But mostly he spends it all in bars
But I'm not like that, not that that's so bad
He says that life is tough and he says he's got enough
But I want more than enough
Is that asking for too much?
I was hypnotized, I was almost paralyzed
They wanted me to stay in line (wanted me to stay in line)
But they don't understand, that was all their plan
Not mine, not like that
Not that that's so bad
I want more than enough
Is that asking for too much?
Is that asking for too much?
