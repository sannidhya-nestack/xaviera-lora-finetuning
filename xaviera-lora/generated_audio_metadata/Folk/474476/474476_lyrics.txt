Whoa, I won't be heard again
Stayin' in my castle right to the end
Whoa, won't be heard again
Oh no, never ever again
I laid my heart out there
With every hot spot light on it
Some things for love just ain't fair
Telling truths and even little lies
Oh, I won't be hurt again
Staying in my castle right to the end
Whoa, won't be hurt again
Oh no, never ever again
Know the pain of a million years
Love is just minutes it appears
Some things for love just ain't fair
In the end does anyone really care?
Whoa, won't be cut no more
Stayin' in my castle, closin' every door
Whoa, won't be cut no more
Oh no, won't be cut no more
Seems easier to keep the walls up
Thirty lows for even one tiny high
Way it goes till the day I die
Sellin' truths and even a couple lies
Whoa, won't be heard again
Stayin' in my castle right to the end
Won't be heard again
Oh no, never ever ever again
Never ever again
Ever again
