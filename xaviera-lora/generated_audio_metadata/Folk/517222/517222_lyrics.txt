I wonder why when green leaves die
They turn a color that's beautiful
Guess nature set a plan in motion
I wonder why I need to cry
When your heart shows how true it is
And my tears flow to the ocean
When I was a child I never dreamed
Of the woman I'd turn out to be
No fairy tale weddings
Or knights on white horses
No little girl fantasies
But blindly I went
Towards the sweetest of songs
And found what I was not looking for
I wonder why
I wonder why
