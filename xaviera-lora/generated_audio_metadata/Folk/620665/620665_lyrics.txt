All I know is that I don't know anything
I'm only swimming in a pond
How can I know?
What is fiction, what is real?
How can I know what I should feel?
Well I need you, you, you
Only you, you, you
Yes, I need you, you, you
Yes, only you, yeah
And even if I want to renegotiate
I'm just a switch on a machine
How can I know if I'm on time or I'm late
If I'm a saint or filled with sin
Well I need you, you, you
Yes only you, you, you
Yes, I need you, you, you
Yes, only you, yeah
In this life
There is nothing I can do
I know I'm right
'Cause all I think about is you
Well I need you, you, you
Only you, you, you
Yes, I need you, you, you
Only you, yeah
