All by yourself, you didn't know what to find there
Walking back home
You're just a boy but with grey hair
Looking upward
The home you left long ago
Seems so small now
But if they're standing strong
You are gone too
Kota Lama
Yang tercinta itu
Kota Lama
Yang tercinta itu
Then after one year
You took us down to the same place
I still can recall
The sad look on your face
When looking upward
The house was snowing
Didn't anyone care
Let's go back to
Kota lama yang tercinta itu
Kota lama yang tercinta itu
Kata lama yang tercinta itu
