You're the most beautiful in the room
Waiting on tables for cowboys and fools
Out here outside of Spokane
I wanna be your man
Well, you've lived a hard luck life
Without losing that spark in your eyes
I love the way you laugh and the way that you move
I want to be the man for you
I want to stay all night
I want to stay all night
Just talking to you
Singing for you
I wanna hear the words you say
I wanna hear everything
I wanna stay all night
We'll make breakfast in the morning
And I'll play you an old Bob Dylan tune
I'll help you get your kids ready for school
I'll be good to you
I wanna stay all night
Stay, stay all night
Ooh
Well it's just hard to say
How two strangers meet anyway
It's not something that you can plan
When a woman meets a man
I wanna stay all night
I wanna stay all night
Just talking to you
Singing for you
I wanna hear the words you say
I wanna hear everything
I wanna stay all night
I wanna stay all night
I wanna stay a whole night
