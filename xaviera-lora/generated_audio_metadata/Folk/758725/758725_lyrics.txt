And he gets the best of your love now
And I know somehow I will fight, I vow
So I'll get the best of your love now
The best of your love now
The best of your love
Where did it go wrong
Keeping a secret inside
Trying to be too strong
Until nothing remains
Except constant pain
And he gets the best of your love now
And I know somehow I will fight, I vow
So I'll get the best of your love now
The best of your love now
The best of your love
I waited with a smile on one of those nights
Waiting to make things right
Normally not my style should be once in a while
And he gets the best of your love now
And I know somehow I will fight, I vow
So I'll get the best of your love now
The best of your love now
The best of your love
I could not compete with him or me
I love you would be sweet, didn't see that was key
But I won't accept defeat
And he gets the best of your love now
And I know somehow I will fight, I vow
So I'll get the best of your love now
The best of your love now
The best of your love, the best of your love
The best of your love, the best of your love
