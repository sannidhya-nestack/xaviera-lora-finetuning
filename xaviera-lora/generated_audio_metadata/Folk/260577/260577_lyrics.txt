As I walked by the dockside one evening so rare
To view the sea waters and take the salt air
I spied an old sailor man singing a song
Oh take me away boys me time is not long
Wrap me up in the oil skins and blankets
No more orthodox I'll be seen
Just tell me old shipmates I'm taking a trip mates
I'll see you someday on Finland's Green
Oh, Fiddler's Green is a place I hear tell
Where sailor men go and they don't go to hell
The weather is fair and the dolphins do play
And the cold coast of England is far, far away
Wrap me up in the oil skins and blankets
No more on the docks I'll be seen
Just tell me old shipmates I'm taking a trip mates
I'll see you someday on Fiddler's Dream
Oh when you're in dock and the long trip is through
There's pubs and there's clubs and there's lassies there too
The girls are all pretty, the beer is all free
And there's bottles of rum hanging off every tree
Wrap me up in the huskins and blankets
No more on the docks I'll be seen
Just tell me all shipmates I'm taking a trip mates
I'll see you Sunday on Fiddler's Green
Oh, I don't want a harp nor a helo, not me
Just give me a breeze in the good rolling sea
I'll play me old squeezebox as we sail along
With the wind in the rigging, I'll sing this song
Wrap me up in me old skins and blankets
No more on the docks I'll be seen
Just tell me old shipmates I'm taking a trip mates
I'll see you someday on Fiddler's Green
Just tell me old shipmates I'm taking a trip mates
I'll see you someday on Fiddler's Green
