See her walking out by the garden, the motion in her stare
Her strange stillness, almost otten the memory
She always carries long ago
When she was still a girl
Back before the grieving came
Mother, oh mother, she cries, come back to me
She calls to the winds to hear her spirit answer
Oh my baby girl
I'm always with you above and behind
you always see me in the sunlight of your mind
As you're calling to my memory
Don't be so sad girl, you're not a bad girl
You're beautiful
See him standing there by the window, compassion in his face
He's quite the man of good reputation
But it means nothing without her long ago
When the summer stayed forever
Long before the restless days
Mother, oh mother, he cries, come back to me
He calls to the wind to hear her spirit answer
Oh my baby boy
I'm always with you, above and behind
you always see me, in the sunlight of your mind
As your call
Don't cling to my memory
Don't be so sad boy
You're not a bad boy
You're beautiful
Listen to the wind
Cry out for her
Gentle it's siren song
Softly is heard
See her walking out by the garden, emotions in her stare
Our strange with stillness, almost otten the memory
She always carries on a go when she was still a girl
Back before the griefing days
Mother, oh mother she cries
Come back to me
She calls to winds to hear her
Spirit answer, oh my baby girl
I'm always with you above and behind
Cause you always see me in the sunlight of your mind
As you're calling to my memory
Don't be so sad girl
You're not a bad girl
You're beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
