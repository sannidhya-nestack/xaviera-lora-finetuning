I look at you, you force a smile
Is it reciprocal, the feeling I hide
We touch the ground with open eyes
We let the silence spread, the feelings we hide
Hold me tight across the chest
For I can't face another day
Nothing's left to fight for anymore
Nothing's left to define
Nothing's left to fight for anymore
Maybe you, maybe me
Oh, it's me, if I lose your love
Oh, I can't face another day
Nothing's left to fight for anymore
Nothing's left to define
Nothing's left to fight for anymore
Maybe you, maybe me
Touch the ground with open eyes
Hold your ground, realize
That nothing's left to fight for anymore
Nothing's left to define
Nothing's left to fight for anymore
And maybe you, maybe me
So hold me, and tight across the chest
For I can't face another day
