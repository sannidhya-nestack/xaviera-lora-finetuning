Your voice is a still wind that sits on the water
Without disturbing the tide
Your lips tease and tempt
The deepest of laughter each time is a perfect surprise
And you pause and you beckon with a look as you turn
And I will follow you without question'til the end of the earth
the end of the earth
the end of the earth
Your words are a whisper that welcome the twilight
As everything's fading away
Your silence, the shadows that soften with moon bright eclipses
That simply amaze
And you pause and you beckon with a look as you turn
And I will follow you without question till the end of the earth
Till the end of the earth
Till the end of the earth
Your hand's soft as feathers that lift us to soar out into a new morning's light
Your heart beat, the rhythm of life
I adore your touches, the burnishing fire
And you pause and you beckon
With a look as you turn
And I will follow you without question
Till the end of the earth
'Til the end of the earth
the end of the earth
And you pause and you beckon with a look as you turn
And I will follow you without question
