Well the world is your oyster
As you gallop far and wide
Trying to hide what man hasn't seen
Where his destructive hand has not been
Keep this world as your oyster
Cause God only knows you've tried
Oh Cherokee, one of God's black pearls
Oh Cherokee, leader of the four winds
Oh Cherokee, is there a place you haven't been
Oh Cherokee, oh Cherokee
You've run through the Sahara Desert
Raced hard from sea to sea
Trying to find any piece of a dream
What they've done to earth is just plain mean
But this world is still your oyster
Cause you're still one who holds a key
Oh Cherokee, one of God's black pearls
Oh Cherokee, leader of the four winds
Oh Cherokee, is there a place you haven't been
Oh Cherokee, oh Cherokee
Your mane is a glossy jet black
Though your eyes seem to just fade away
And as the dust rises high from the power of your stride
Over the river you made for all the times you cried
Keep this world as your oyster
Cause God only knows you've tried
Oh Cherokee, one of God's black pearls
Oh Cherokee, leader of the four winds
Oh Cherokee, is there a place you haven't been
Oh Cherokee, oh Cherokee
Oh Cherokee, oh Cherokee
