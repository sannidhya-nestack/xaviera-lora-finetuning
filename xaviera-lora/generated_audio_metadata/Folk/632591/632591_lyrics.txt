Beautiful boy with an easy smile
Gentle soul and a flair for style
Tried his best to please his mom
Did his chores, got his homework done
Bully coiled to attack
That beautiful lad in the schoolyard
Enlisting his gang to sink their fangs
Into that child's innocent heart
Oh bully, what have you done?
He said you and your gang were just having fun
Calling him faggot, calling him queer
Spewing your venom to his ear
But the day arrived that lad couldn't go inside that school yard
So filled with pending doom
So he stayed at home instead and hung himself in his room, bully
What have you done?
You said you and your gang were just having fun
Calling him faggot, calling him queer
Spewing your venom to his ear
Now beneath the cold grey sky the hearse rolls by
Cars snaking along behind
And the kids and the gang come over and hang at the edge of the sidewalk
To try and catch a glimpse of the ghost that will haunt them the rest of their lives
Oh, bully, what have you done?
You murdered a child with your hateful tongue
Calling him faggot, calling him queer
But he can no longer hear
