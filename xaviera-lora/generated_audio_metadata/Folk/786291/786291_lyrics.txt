Jesus loved the sinner as much as the saint
He shared his love with everyone and we should do the same
So open up your heart and let the love flow in
And you will see there will be a change from within
God bless the universe and everyone on earth
God bless the universe and everyone on earth
God bless the universe and everyone on earth
God bless the universe and everyone on earth
Go out and spread the good news
There's hope for everyone
We are all God's children
Each and every one
And love is a sacred flower
That grows in the heart
It may not be all we need
But it's a good start
God bless the universe and everyone on earth
God bless the universe and everyone on earth
God bless the universe and everyone on earth
God bless the universe and everyone on earth
God bless the universe and everyone on earth
God bless the universe and everyone on earth
God bless the universe and everyone on earth
God bless the universe and everyone on earth
And everyone on earth
Everyone on earth, everyone on earth
Everyone on earth, everyone on earth
Everyone on earth, everyone on earth
