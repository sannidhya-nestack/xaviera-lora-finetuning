Going up to Sligo
Gonna climb Mount Knapneray
Wanna conjure up a double rainbow
Just like we did that day
Sligo from your mountain looking down
I can feel your hills and valleys hear your sounds
I can wander at the stones piled on this mound
Sligo
Climbing up to Karakil
Gonna slip under a stone
Let the sunrise on the equinox
Set fire to our bones
Sligo from your mountain looking down
I can feel your hills and valleys, smell your sounds
I can wonder at these dolmens, hallowed ground
Oh, Sligo
Sunstorm on the ocean
Blowing up a spray
Ten thousand years of mystery
Splashes on our face
Splashes on our face
Going up to Slago
Gonna climb upon Maeve's mound
Hear the crashing of the ocean
See her strike the hammer down
Slido from this mountain looking down
I can feel your hills and valleys hear your sounds
I can wander up the stones while under this mound
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
