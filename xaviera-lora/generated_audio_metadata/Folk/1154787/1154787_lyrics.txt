Where are all the songs gone? I don't hear them anymore
Where are all the tunes that brought me to my knees down on the floor?
The themes that used to walk me to your door?
Have been drowned by accusations
Of who went where and why, what for?
Where have all your friends gone if they see them around?
You used to have such energy but now your power's running down
They only ever see you drinking these days
And when it comes to conversation well there's nothing left to say except
Where has all the love gone?
Where has all the love gone?
And where have all the drugs gone since love's gone wrong?
Hey, where has all the sex gone? I don't get none anymore
What happened to the one night stands that kept me apart from my best hand?
And where are all the women that I need?
To help me get my head down
And share the goodness of my seat
So where has all the love gone?
Where has all the love gone?
And where have all the drugs gone
Since love's gone wrong?
Where have all the drugs gone since this love's gone wrong
What happened to the heart shaped pills, cocaine speed and opium
The needles I need to come alive
Have been broken up by visions of bloody wounds and genocide
So where has all the love gone
Where has all the love gone?
And where have all the drugs gone since love's gone wrong?
And where are all the women that I need?
Help me get my head down
And share the goodness of my seed
So where has all the love gone?
Where has all the love gone?
And where have all the drugs gone since love's gone wrong?
Where has all the love gone?
Where has all the love gone?
And where have all the drugs gone since love's gone wrong?
Where has all the love gone since love's gone wrong?
Since love's gone, yeah (where has all my love gone?)
Since love's gone, yeah (where has all the love gone?)
