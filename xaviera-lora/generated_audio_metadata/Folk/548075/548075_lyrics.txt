Praise the Lord, we call Almighty
Praise to Him for every soul
Praise the Lord for every child born
Through every bell we toll
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord for every mountain
Every valley, every field
For giving us this world to strive in
And for all our wounds He's healed
Praise the Lord
Praise Him, praise Him
Praise the Lord
For every sunrise
And for every sunset too
Praise to Him
For the gift of life
And for loving me and you
Praise the Lord
More more than any other thing
We'd bank with one accord
It's iving the things we haven't done
Like helping those ignored
Praise the Lord (Praise Him, Praise Him)
Praise the Lord for every sunrise
And for every sunset too
Praise to Him for the gift of life
And for loving me and you
Praise the Lord
Praise Him for the gift of life
And for loving me and you
Praise the Lord
