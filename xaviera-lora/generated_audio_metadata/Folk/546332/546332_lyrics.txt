All I ever do is put me down
When I'm alone or hanging round the town
I hear the voice come whispering in my ear
You're a loser, you're a loser, do you hear?
I try to shut me out, I drink a beer
But I won't go away, I stay right here
You're a nugget, bum, a waster like they said
My words sink to the bottom of me like lead
Oh all I ever do is put me down
When I'm alone or hanging round the town
Oh, I hear the voice come whispering in my ear
You're a loser, you're a loser, do you hear?
I try to get up, been trying to for years
Soon as I do, the devil reappears
Is he right or is he wrong, who knows?
Here he comes, dressed in familiar clothes
Yeah I try to get up but I put me down
I'm tired of being a nobody in this town
I turn a corner there I am again
Follow me around since the lord knows when
Oh, all I ever do is put me down
When I'm alone or hanging round the town
I hear the voice come whispering in my ear
You're a loser, you're a loser, do you hear?
I try to shut me out, I drink a beer
Beer or tequila's all they got right here
You're the nugget, nothing, everybody was right
You got no friends, no nothing but the night
I go back inside, darling, where've you been?
Out for a walk, downtown I mean
Did you see anybody she says no just myself
In an old shop window gritting on a shelf
Oh all I ever do is put me down
When I'm alone or hanging round the town
I hear the voice come whispering in my ear
You're a loser, you're a loser, do you hear
You're a loser, you're a loser, do you hear?
