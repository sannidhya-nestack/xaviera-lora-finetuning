You know I think kudzu's got a bad rap
What's wrong with someone that just wants to reach out and hug you?
You folks got it too good
I had kudzu for three meals a day during the depression
Mama put syrup on it in the morning
Catsup in the afternoon
Barbecue sauce at night
There's even a restaurant in Juliet, G ia that sells fried green kudzu
What other color does it come in?
By the time you done eating that vine that's hanging from your mouth and dragging on the floor
Don't tell me'bout sanitary conditions
I'll grab that vine and want you'til you tell me kudzu's middle name
And you'll show it some respect and be doing the kudzu crawl
Oh, I hear mama calling me
