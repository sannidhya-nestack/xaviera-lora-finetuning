I told you I loved you in London town
Surprised my lips when the words fell out
They stumbled out clumsy and foolish
Oh yes they did
And do our debts ever leave?
No, no, never in my wildest dreams
You said that you think you love me too
I blushed, burning red and so did you
And then I ot my surroundings
Oh yes I did
And do I dare to believe
No one or never in my wildest dreams
So lay me down in fields of green
Somewhere we won't be seen
And you can et your surroundings
Oh yes you can
Do I dare to believe
No no never in my wildest dreams
So come on and say it'll always be true
And I will never betray you
So give me your soul and your body
Always
And do I dare to believe
No no never in my wildest dreams
And do I dare to believe
No no never in my wildest dreams
No no never in my wildest dreams
No, no, never in my wildest dreams
