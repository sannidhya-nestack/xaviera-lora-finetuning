I was thinking about something I read
Where love is a hunger and life's daily bread
So what is the answer to the hunger we've known?
The message is simple, let your love grow
time after time, we're counting when it ends
Truth is everlasting while the days that pass away
Don't measure our worth by the places we've been
Wrathed by the soul that lives on and within
You let your love grow in the spirit
You let your love grow with your heart and soul
Let your love grow
Let your love grow
I was thinking about something you said
When life is an ocean of dreams in our head
We're head above water, we can float, sink or swim
Hey, now we're already wet, so jump right on in
time after time, only kinda win the days
Truth is everlasting while the days they pass away
Don't measure our worth by the places we've been, rather by the soul
That lives on and within
You let your love grow in the spirit
You let your love grow with your heart and soul
You let your love grow
Let your love grow
It don't matter all the songs that I sing
If I don't give now all the love that I bring
What is the answer to the heartache I've known
Well the message is simple, let iveness grow
Cause time after time
Now I count away my days
Truth is everlasting
While my days they pass away
Don't measure my worth by the places I've been
Or rather by the soul that lives on and within
You let your love grow in the spirit
You let your love grow with your heart and soul
You let your love grow
You let your love grow in the spirit
With your heart and soul
And your spirit
Heart and soul
Let your love grow
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let your love grow
In the spirit
With your heart and soul
