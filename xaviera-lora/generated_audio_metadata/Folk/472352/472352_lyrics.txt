Here's a song called "Black Velvet Band"
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds
You'd think she was queen of the land
Her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band
As I was driving down Broadway
Not intending to stay very long
I spotted a frolicsome dancer
As she came a-tripping along
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds
You'd think she was queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band
And what she pulled from my pocket
And slipped it right into my hand
On the very first day that I met her
Bad luck to your black velvet band
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds
You'd think she was queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band
In front of the judge the next morning
When both of us did appear
And the gentleman claimed was his jury
And the case against us was clear
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds
You'd think she was queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band
For ten long years accommodation far away from Cape Breton Isle
Far away from friends and relations bad luck to your black velvet band
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds you'd think she was queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds
You'd think she was queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band
