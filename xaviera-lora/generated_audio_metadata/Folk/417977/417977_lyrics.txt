Come through the water into the night
Deep in the darkness you will find light
Come, he seemed to say that night
With open arms of dazzling white
But I was young and oh so afraid
I turned from the water and I ran away
Come through the water into the night
Deep in the darkness you will find light
Haunted by that summer night
I search for answers to my fright
Are facing shadows deep in my soul
Embracing the darkness and finding the goal
Come through the water into the night
Deep in the darkness you will find light
Roads and rivers they lead us home
Different paths and journeys to find your home
There is one meant only for you
Pursue it with passion and a heart that is true
