Apples, pears, nuts and fruit
Chips and dip with lots of soup
Lettuce and biscotti sauce
Deli counter cubes of ice
Website groceries to my door
Everything I need for sure
Frozen entrees and dessert
Discount pricing doesn't hurt
Website groceries, you're the best
I'll abandon all the rest
Open all the day and night
I can shop till moon daylight
I can shop
I can shop till moon daylight
Moon daylight
I can shop
I can shop till moon daylight
Moon daylight
Moon daylight
Moon daylight
Fresh strawberries in season
Why look elsewhere, no reason
Dairy products, so much more
Shop from home, so much allure
In my jammies, night or day
I can shop without delay
Even stamps to post my mail
Even coupons for a sale
Website groceries, you're the best
I'll abandon all the rest
Open all the day and night
I can shop till moon daylight
I can shop
I can shop till moon daylight
Moon daylight
I can shop
I can shop till moon daylight
Moon daylight
Moon daylight
Moon daylight
Salting crackers, tangerines
Laughed so hard, split my screen
Stuck inside my house all day
You delivered, no delay
Even when the order's placed
Add those things, otten haste
No long lines, it beats the band
Charge card miles, yes I can
Website groceries, you're the best
I'll abandon all the rest
Open all the day and night
I can shop'til moon day light
I can shop, I can shop'til moon day light
Moon day light
I can shop, I can shop'til moon day light
Moon day light
