Wishing, wishing, wishing I was home with you
Wishing, wishing, wishing home just us two
Wishing, wishing, wishing home with you
My life is a journey
And no matter where I roam
All paths lead me back to home
Took me some time to see
Such wasted time to see
Wishing, wishing, wishing I was home with you
Wishing, wishing, wishing home just us two
Wishing, wishing, wishing home with you
The times when I closed my eyes
I remember our long goodbyes
Your beauty and fragrance lingers still
To leave you took all of my will
Leaving you took all of my will
Wishing, wishing, wishing I was home with you
Wishing, wishing, wishing home just us two
Wishing, wishing, wishing home with you
You were the best thing
Had to leave just to be, but
No matter where I hear you sing
What will be is going to be
You and me will have to see
Wishing, wishing, wishing I was home with you
Wishing, wishing, wishing home just us two
Wishing, wishing, wishing home with you
Wishing, wishing, wishing I was home with you
Wishin', wishin', wishin' home
