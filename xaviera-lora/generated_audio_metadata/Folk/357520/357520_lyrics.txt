Dancing on heat waves that roll from her skin
The sweetness that love brings when I let her in
The streets filled with ponies, they're dancing around
The music box children who sing from town to town
They sing one, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
Little birds
Out of the silence and into the west
Pictures of memories found in a chest
Childhood glue and boxes of tin
The dreamers and the truth are gathered within
One, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
Little birds
And we all know
We try not to show restraint
Restraint could be our love
When tears become armor, a shield to hold
When shame and fatigue have taken their toll
When all of the kindness locked in your soul
When will the broken feel
But one, two, three, and one, two, three, one, two, three, little bird
