Oh, the summer time is coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
For their colors are perfuming
We'll go lassie go
And we'll all go together
And pluck wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Where you go, lassie, go
I will build my love a bower
By your clear crystal fountain
And on it I will pile all the flowers of the mountain
We'll go, lassie, go, and we'll all go together
And pluck wild mountain thyme all around the blooming heather
Where you go, lassie, go
If my true love will not go
I shall surely find another
Where the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the purple heather
Will you go, Lassie, go?
And we'll all go together
And pluck wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Will you go, Lassie, go?
Oh, the summertime's coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
For their colors are perfuming
We'll go lassie go
And we'll all go together
And pluck wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Where you go, lassie, go
