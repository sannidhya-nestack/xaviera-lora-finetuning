A simple man, son of a carpenter
Walked amongst us to spread the word
Travelled far and wide, anywhere to be heard
Built a following, they say even heard
At the heart of the message, just ten simple rules
Oh, Jesus, won't you please take my hand?
And Jesus, do you still have a plan?
Jesus, be quick, you know I can't stand
Jesus, let's go to your land
Now is now and anything but simple
The power of a church that has their own word
And many today think that you're still here
With the world in despair
Do you really care?
When time's running low, good time for you to be heard
Oh, Jesus, won't you please take my hand?
And Jesus, do you still have a plan?
Jesus, be quick, you know I can't stand
Jesus, let's go to your land
Oh, to be open
I never thought you were supreme
I felt you were just human
But I liked your dream of simple rules that carve out
Honor and value and strong family love
Just like you two, Mary and you
This world sure needs you
Oh Jesus
Jesus
Oh Jesus, won't you please take my hand
And Jesus, do you still have a plan
Jesus, be quick, you know I can't stand
Jesus, let's go to your land
Jesus, please take my hand
And Jesus
Do you still have a plan
Jesus be quick
You know I can't stand
Jesus let's go to your land
Let's go to your land
Jesus
