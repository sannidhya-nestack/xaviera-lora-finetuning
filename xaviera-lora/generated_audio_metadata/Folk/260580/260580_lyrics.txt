It's a damn tough life full of toil and strife we whale men undergo
And we don't give a damn when the gale has stopped, how hard the wind did blow
We're homeward bound is a grand old sound on a girl's ship, taunt and free
We don't give a damn when we drink our rum with the girls on Old Maui
Rolling down to Old Maui, me boys rolling down to Old Maui
We're homeward bound from the Arctic round, rolling down to Old Maui
Once more we sail with a northerly gale through the ice and sleet and rain
And them coconut fronds in them tropic lands we soon shall see again
Six hellish months we've passed away in the cold Conchargo sea
And now we're bound from the Arctic ground
Rolling down to Old Maui
Rolling down to Old Maui
Me boys rolling down to Old Maui
We're homeward bound from the Arctic ground
Rolling down to Old Maui
We'll heave the lead where old Diamond Head looms up on old Oahu
Our masts and yards are sheathed with ice, our decks are hid from view
The horrid tiles of sea cut ice that deck the Arctic Sea
Are miles behind in the frozen wind since we steered for old Maui
Rolling down to old Maui
Me boys rolling down to old Maui
We're homeward bound from the Arctic round
Rolling down to old Maui
And now we're anchored in the bay
Where the Kanaka's all around
With chants and soft alohais they greet us homeward bound
And now ashore we'll have good fun we'll paint them beaches red
Awaken in the arms of a wahine with a big fat aching head
Rolling down New Old Maui
Me boys rolling down New Old Maui
We're homeward bound from the Arctic ground
Rolling down New Old Maui
Rolling down New Old Maui
Me boys rolling down New Old Maui
We're homeward bound from the Arctic ground
Rolling down to old Maui
