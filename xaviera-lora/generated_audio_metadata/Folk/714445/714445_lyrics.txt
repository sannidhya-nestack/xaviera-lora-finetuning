I first met you in the highland
Pretty girl so strangely fair
As to catch my eye and keep it hand
To steal my breath away
I was young but you were younger
And I followed in
Just to touch your freckled cheek last summer
To hold your lily hand
It was far from me to wonder
How you left me half begun
Why you strove so hard to make me love the
Of my child
Though I've built a life I'm proud of
As her husband and his dead
From a distance I have watched you often
Feeling somewhat sad
Now you watch me too, I venture
Feeling somewhat centered trust
Yet glad that we were right enough
To do what well we must
So my own, you mapped the road I had to travel
Though it left you quite alone
I was young but you were younger
And I followed
Just to touch your freckled cheek last fall
To hold your lily hand
Now you're older and I am older
And our future's closer hand
Soon we'll be at last together
In our dreams of Ireland
In our dreams of Ireland
In our dreams of Ireland
