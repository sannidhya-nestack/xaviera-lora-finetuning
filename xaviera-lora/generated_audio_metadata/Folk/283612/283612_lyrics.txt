I killed Jesus Christ That's what I was told
When I was in the first grade
And only six years old
I tried to say I didn't do it
But I was told to shut my trap
They say he died because of my sins
I killed him and that was that
What's a young boy to do?
How's the rest of his life supposed to be?
Only six years old and guilty
Of murder in the first degree
I told Jesus and Mary I was sorry
But I really did not remember the crime
They just smiled down upon me and said
The real criminals will pay in due time
I killed Jesus Christ
That's what I was told
When I was in the first grade
And only six years old
