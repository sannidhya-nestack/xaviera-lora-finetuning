Looking for a love that I know will grow
Looking for a love that survives the lows
Looking for the one and I know it's you
Let's give it a go, a chance to grow
You gotta know that I love you so
Love comes with so little rules
Attracts the deserving and the fools
Is it true love or a nightmare
Hard to dare to care
Hard to dare to care
But I care
Looking for a love that I know will grow
Looking for a love that survives the lows
Looking for the one and I know it's you
Let's give it a go, a chance to grow
You gotta know that I love you so
Love is never how we planned
Emotions go from a laugh to a cry
Love it when you take my hand
Nothing like love to create this high
Nothing like love to create this high
And I want this high
Looking for a love that I know will grow
Looking for a love that survives the lows
Looking for the one and I know it's you
Let's give it a go, a chance to grow
You gotta know that I love you so
So maybe love is blind
To nurture it
It takes time
To trust the other mind
To say I love you
When I finally knew
And I know
Looking for a love that I know will grow
Looking for a love that survives the lows
Looking for the one and I know it's you
Let's give it a go, a chance to grow
You gotta know that I love you so
Looking for a love that I know will grow
Looking for a love that survives the lows
Looking for the one and I know it's you
Let's give it a go, a chance to grow
You gotta know that I love you so
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
