When life's upsets leave you gasping
And you're looking for a cure
I have got a strategy that works each time for sure
And it doesn't have any calories
And it doesn't cost anything
And it's always available
Just blame someone
It's so easy it hardly takes any practice
You're the cause of all my problems, mom
You grounded me when I was eight
I couldn't get a tattoo
Pierce my tongue or come in late
Now I have sex without protection
Because I know it makes you mad
And if I get pregnant accidentally
Well, we'll move in with you and dad
Oh, blaming's not defaming or disclaiming, can't you see?
It's so sticky, it's so icky, taking responsibility
It's so simple, it's so obvious, we shouldn't suffer or feel pain
And if we do, we need a who?
We need someone we can blame
This verse is for the men
You're the cause of all my problems, dad
I could never do enough
Even if I went to Harvard
I wouldn't be packing the right stuff
So now I'm doomed to prove my manhood
Every day in every way
And if I win a Nobel Prize
You'll have nothing good to say
Oh, blaming's not defaming or disclaiming, can't you see?
It's so sticky, it's so icky, taking responsibility
It's so simple, it's so obvious, we shouldn't suffer or feel pain
And if we do, we really need a who
We need someone we can blame
Well, I'm a woman, so of course the gender I would choose to blame would be, well, men
You're the cause of all my problems, men
I give and give, you take and take
Your self-absorption drowns me like a bottomless sucking lake
I feel lonely and unworthy
No one will ever cherish me
And in my last enlightened moments
I hope you get an STD
Oh blaming, stop defaming or disclaiming, can't you see?
It's so sticky, it's so icky, taking responsibility
It's so simple, it's so obvious, we shouldn't suffer or feel pain
And if we do, we need a who?
We need someone we can blame
Well, if blaming parents isn't enough
And if blaming the other gender isn't enough
There's always another place we can go to blame
You're the cause of all my problems, God
You created gravity
Now every time I stumble
I'm sure the earth is picking on me
Hurricanes and floods are nasty
Measles, death, and avian flu
And if you don't improve your job performance
I may have to outsource you
Oh, blaming's not defaming or disclaiming, can't you see?
It's so sticky, it's so icky, taking responsibility
It's so simple, it's so obvious, we shouldn't suffer or feel pain
And if we do, we'll find a who?
We'll find someone we can't blame
