The flick of a tail, the blink of an eye
Lurkers in the shadows, a distant cry
Darkness pales, dawn breaks clear
But there's a rumble in the distance that the wild ones hear
And where will the wild ones go in the wake of the bulldozer blade?
Where will the wild ones go?
Chainsaws roar, another tree falls
Forests topple for shopping malls
Wild ones scramble while humans plot
The next invasion of their Camelot
And where will the wild ones go in the wake of the bulldozer blade?
Where will the wild ones go?
Black bear wandered into town
In search of food and a place to lie down
But the crowd they saw him and they gathered round
Then they shot him, shot him to the ground
No place left to go in the wake of the bulldozer blade
No place left to go
So where will the wild ones go in the wake of the bulldozer blade?
Where will the wild ones go?
Where will the wild ones go?
