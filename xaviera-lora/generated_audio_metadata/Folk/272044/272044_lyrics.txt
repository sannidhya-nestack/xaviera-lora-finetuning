One, two, three, four.
Tell me baby is it me you think of
When your thoughts drift far away
Tell me baby when you wish upon a star what do you say
Do you still love me
Do you still miss my touch
Well I guess I pushed you away
Well I guess I love too much
Tell me baby would you take my hand
If I asked you for a dance
Tell me baby is it late for us or is there still a chance
Because I still love you and I still miss your touch
And I guess I pushed you away well I guess I love too much
Tell me baby is it me you think of
When your eyes are all ablaze
Tell me baby when you wish upon a star
What do you say
I still love you and I still miss your touch
I guess I pushed you away well I guess I love too much
