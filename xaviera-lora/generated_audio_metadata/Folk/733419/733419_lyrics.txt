I'm not bald (he's not bald)
I'm not bald (he's not bald)
Je ne suis pas un ouillet
I'm not bald (he's not bald)
I'm not bald (he's not bald)
Je ne suis pas un ouillet
I can look out of this window and watch the rain come down
Or imagine what it's like when the sun shines on this town
I can stare at the grey wall, look faces to my room
And if I crimp my neck I can see four square feet of gloom, I'm not bored
I'm not bored (he's not bored)
I'm not bored (he's not bored)
Je le suis pas, oui, yeah
I'm not bored (he's not bored)
I'm not bored (he's not bored)
Je le suis pas, oui, yeah
Well, it's not as if I'm trapped in here
I know that I am free
And if I were you (and you were me)
Then both of us could see
That if I had a raincoat
I could have a splashing time
But I left it with my umbrella
And my Wellington boots of mine
I'm not bored
Well, I'm not bored (he is not bored)
I'm not bored (he is not bored)
Je ne suis pas un "oui et"
I'm not born, he's not born
I'm not born, he's not born
Je ne suis pas un "oui et"
What is he doing on his own in this room?
I don't know, but I think he doesn't know.
I'm not bored, what does that mean? Is it French?
Well, he's not French, is he?
No, but we're going to make him think it's okay.
Well, I've inspected every corner of this little chambre d'hôte
And I've found a couple of things that you might call worthy of note
There's a towel (and a sheet) and a little bottle of shampoo
And a brand new shower cap that I might use if I have to (if you have to)
Well, I'm not bored (he's not bored)
I'm not bored (he's not bored)
Je ne suis pas ouillé
I'm not bored (he's not bored)
I'm not bored (he's not bored)
Je ne suis pas ouillé
There's a wardrobe with no door and a miniature TV
It gets all the French channels from one to twenty-three
And there's a small formica table with an interesting array of tea and sugar sachets
Not to mention Nescafe
I'm not bored
Well I'm not bored (he's not bored) I'm not bored (he's not bored)
Je ne suis pas enouillé
I'm not bored (he's not bored)
I'm not bored (he's not bored)
Je ne suis pas enouillé
I'm not bored (he's not bored)
I'm not bored (he's not bored)
Je ne suis pas enouillé
I'm not bored (he's not bored)
But I'm not bored (he's not bored)
Je ne suis pas, je ne suis pas, je ne suis pas un mouillé
