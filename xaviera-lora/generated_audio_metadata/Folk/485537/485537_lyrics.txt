I guess it's time to go, leave this place for a while
And go back to the life that I've known since I was just a child
I tried to fit in here, become part of your world
I looked for the meaning in you, you were my pearl
In a sea full of oysters that spread out on these streets
They never let their shells open so they're never released
They'll stay locked up inside
Fear that their only prize might become stolen
You know they might become stone
I think part of its culture may be part of its pride
I was willing to learn without taking sides
And now we're both caught adrift
In fear of overturning
The wind changed direction
And everyone went flying
Into a sea full of oysters that spread out on these streets
They never let their shells open so they're never released
They'll stay locked up inside, fear that their only prize might become stolen
You know they might become stolen
When will I learn that as hard as I try
Some people don't wanna be saved from the lives that they're living in
And they're living in
A sea full of oysters that spreads out on these streets
They never let their shells open so they're never released
They'll stay locked up inside
Feared that their only prize might become stolen
You know they might become stolen
Stolen
(I'm gonna leave you)
(Hmmmm)
