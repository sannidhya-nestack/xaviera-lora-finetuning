What care we how light the spray is
What care we for wind or weather
Let her go boys every inch is
Sailing homeward to Mingulay
Heel your hoe, boys, let'er go, boys
Heave her head'round into the weather
Heel your hoe, boys, let'er go, boys
Sailing homeward to Mingulay
Clap your eyes on the sun a-rising
Ghouls and doves fill the sky with feather
Cut her loose, boys, for the horizon
We'll be home soon in Mingulay
Heel your hoe boys, ladder go boys
Heave ahead round into the weather
Heel your hoe boys, ladder go boys
Sailing homeward to Mingulay
Wives are waiting on the bank or looking seaward from the heaven
Pull her round boys and you'll anchor, ere the sun sets on Mingulay
Heel your hoe boys, let'er go boys
He will head'round into the weather
Heel your hoe boys, let'er go boys
Sailing homeward to Mingulay
Wives are waiting by the gate
We've been waiting since the break of day
We're pumped dry and walking larver'd
To our wives on Mingulay
Heel your hoe, heel your slat and go, boys
Leave the head around into the weather
Heel your hoe, heel your slat and go, boys
Sailing homeward to Mingulay
What care we have like the rising of stars?
We're waiting on the dawn of a new day
Nightingale birds have their nest at Cheshire
Sailing round home to Mangalaysia
In Mingulay, on Mingulay
Heal your homeward to Mingulay (Heal your homeward as land ago lies)
Beaverhead round into the weather (Beaverhead round into the weather)
Heal your homeward as land ago lies (Heal your homeward as land ago lies, oh)
Sailing homeward to Mingulay
Sailing homeward to Mingulay
