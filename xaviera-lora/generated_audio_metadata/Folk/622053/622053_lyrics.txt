When I think of all the things you gave me
A love that I will always know
A place that I can always go
I close my eyes and I can hear you saying
The words that make it all okay
No matter what I face today
And time don't stand a chance
The years they just fade away
It's like you were here just yesterday
And I, I'm a better man
Knowing that the wisdom you shared long ago
Still lives in me yet it's still just taking hold
And I, I know love
In the sun or in the rain
In the joy or in the pain
And I, I know love
Good days or the bad
If they're happy or they're sad
I know you're loved
When I think of all the love
You showed me, showed me how to always see the light
That everything will turn out right
I can feel your arms wrap around me
Even when I had no words to say
Your love always made it okay
Now I, I understand
Now look into my child's face
It's me standing here in your place
And I, I'm a better man
Knowing that the wisdom you shared long ago
Still lives in me, yet it's still just taking hold
And I, I know love
In the sun or in the rain
In the joy or in the pain
And I, I know love
Good days or the bad
If the happy or the sad I know your love
It carries on
It's never gonna fade away
Your love it lives today it makes me strong
I, I know love
In the sun or in the rain
With the joy or in the pain
And I, I know love
Good days or the bad
Whether happy or they're sad
I know you love
I know you love
