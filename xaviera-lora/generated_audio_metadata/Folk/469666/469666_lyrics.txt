Way hey and away we go
Donkey riding, donkey riding
Way hey and away we go
Riding on the donkey
Was you ever down Mobile Bay, screwing cotton all the day
Dollar a day is a white man's pay, riding on the donkey
Way hey and away we go, donkey riding donkey riding
Way hey and away we go, riding on the donkey
Was you ever in Canton where the men wear pigtails long
And the gals play honky-konk riding on a donkey
Way hey and away we go donkey riding donkey riding
Way hey and away we go riding on a donkey
Was you ever in London town where them gals they all come down
To see the king in a golden crown riding on the donkey
Way hey and away we go donkey riding donkey riding
Way hey and away we go riding on the donkey
Was you ever off Cape Horn
Where your backside's never warm
Wished to hell you'd never been born
Riding on the donkey
Way hey and away we go
Donkey riding, donkey riding
Way hey and away we go
Riding on the donkey
