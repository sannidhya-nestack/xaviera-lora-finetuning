I know that you're out there
You take after me
I know when you've been through
You've seen what I've seen
You're working on something in your life
For you to be
Pick it up
I know you're after, learned it from me
But I couldn't teach you
Everything
When you're out on your own
You'll find what you need
Cause you know
Where we hide
The key
It's time to come back home
Come back home
I know why you're out there
When are you coming back home? (Come back home)
It shows us you care
I know that you know we know why you're out there
So keep the light on
When are you coming back home?
Wherever you roam
Your eyes tell me everything
And they hurt you sometimes
You whisper the breath
Secure your heart
Your promise leads us everywhere
Believe in our dream, it's our dream
It's alright if you can't stop tonight
So the lights are green
It's time to come back home
Come back home
I know why you're out there
When are you coming back home
Come back home
You show us you care
I know that you know
We know that you're right
So we'll keep the light on
Know that you know that we know that you're out there
I know that you know that we know that you care to share
I know that you know that we know that you're out there
I know that you know that we know that you care
Has it been a while?
It's time to come back home
I know why you're out there I know that you're out there
We're coming home
It shows us you care
I know that you're out there We're coming back home
We know why you're out there (know that you're out there, out there, out there)
We're coming home (home)
Show us you care, I know that you know
We know why you're out there
So keep the light on
