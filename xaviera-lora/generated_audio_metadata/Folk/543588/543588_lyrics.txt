Love me or leave me, it's all up to you
Just know I'll always be true
Take me, forsake me, whatever you do
Just know I'll always love you
There'll be times in the sunshine
There'll be times in the rain
Times we'll be laughing
And times we'll feel pain
But when it's all over
I'm sure you'll agree
That those were the times of our lives
Love me or leave me it's all up to you
But know I've always been true
Take me or forsake me whatever you do
Just know I've always loved you
Still living, the times of our life
