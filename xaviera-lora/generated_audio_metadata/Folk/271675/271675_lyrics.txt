There's nothing that I'd rather do than to spend a night with you
No place that I'd rather stay than where I am today
No one who I'd rather see each time I close my eyes
Didn't always feel this way but I will until I die
I just want you to hold my hand
I just want you to try and understand
I just want you
And you're all I really need now
And I need you like the morning meets the sun
There's nothing that I'd rather do than to come home every night
Take you in my arms and hold you'til the morning light
Wake you every morning with a kiss upon your brow
I know I seldom say these things but I hope you know somehow
I just want you girl to hold my hand
I just want you to try and understand
Girl, you're all I really need now, and I, I need you like the moon and is the sun
There's nothing that I'd rather do than to spend my every day
Following you all around the house and looking at you that way
The weather makes you light all up and say that you'll be mine
Tomorrow and the next day until the end of time
I just want you, girl, to hold my hand
I just want you to try and understand
I just want you, girl, and you're all I really need now and I
I need you like the morning is the sun
I just want you, girl, to hold my hand
I just want you to try and understand
I just want you
Girl, you're all I really need now and I
I need you like the morning needs the sun
Yeah, I need you like the morning needs the sun
