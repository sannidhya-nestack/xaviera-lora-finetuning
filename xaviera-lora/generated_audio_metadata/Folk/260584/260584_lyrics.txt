Fifteen men on the dead man's chest
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum
Drink and the devil had done for the rest
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum
The mate was fixed by the bosun's pike
The bosun brain with a marlin spike
And cookie's throat was markby like
It had been gripped by fingers ten
And there they lay all good dead men
Like break of day in a booze and can
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Fifteen men are the whole ship's list
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum
Dead and bedammed and the rest gone waste
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum
The skipper lay with his knob in gore
Where the scion zacks his cheek at shore
And scion he will stab times four
And there they lay while soggy skies drip
All day long in upstairin' eyes
In murk sunset and foul sunrise
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Fifteen men of'em stiff and stark
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Ten of the crew at the murder mark
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
a cutlass swipe or an ounce of lead
A yawing hole in a battered head and the scuff
Burrs glut with a rotting red
And there they lay, I damn me eyes
All lookouts clapped on paradise
All souls bound just contrary wise
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Fifteen men of'em good and true
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Every man jack could a sail with hope you
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
There was chest on chest full of Spanish gold
With a ton of plate in the middle hold
And the cabins right of loot untold
And they lay there that took the plumb
With sightless glare and their lips struck dumb
While we shared all by the rule of thumb
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
More was seen through a stern light screen
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Charting, no doubt, where a woman had been (Yo-ho-ho, in a bottle of rum)
A flimsy shift on a bunker cot
With a dark slit sheared through the bosom spot
And the lace stiff dry in her purplish blot
Well, she went to some shuddering maid
Who dared the knife and took the blade
By God, she had stopped for a plucky jade
Yo-ho-ho, in a bottle of rum
Fifteen men on the dead man's chest
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Drink and the devil had done for the rest
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
We wrapped'em all in a mainsail tie
With twice ten turns of a hauser's bite
And we heaved'em over and out of sight
With a "Yo heave ho" and a "fare thee well"
And a sudden thump in the solitary swell
Ten fathoms deep on the road to hell
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
