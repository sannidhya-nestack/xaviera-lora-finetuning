Someday the real rain is gonna fall on you
And it won't matter what you do
One way or another you are gonna fade away
And it don't matter what you say
Sometimes the sun will shed some light
Every little thing is alright
Sometimes the day delays the night
But you know, the real rain's gonna fall
It's gonna fall
Today, what do you plan to do?
To keep the rain clouds off of you
Enjoy your sunshine days
And your skies of blue
And keep the dark skies far away from you
Sometimes the sun will shed some light
Every little thing is alright
Sometimes the day delays the night
But you know the real rain's gonna fall
It's gonna fall
These are the seasons of your life
As lessons in them all
With sunshine
The rain sometimes falls
Sometimes the sun will share some light
And every little thing is alright
Sometimes day delays the night
But you know the real rain's gonna fall
It's gonna fall
