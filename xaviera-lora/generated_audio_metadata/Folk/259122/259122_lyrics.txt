Riggin' in the Riggin'
Riggin' in the Riggin'
Riggin' in the Riggin'
there's fuck all else to do
'Twas back in'69, we worked the blackball line
Sad where we went out to sea, we left the gals behind
Now we're friggin' in the riggin', friggin' in the riggin', friggin' in the riggin'
there's fuck all else to do
The cook, his name was Davey, he was cashiered from the Navy
He dipped the bread inside the head and he served it up his gravy
Friggin' in the Riggin', Friggin' in the Riggin'
Friggin' in the Riggin','cause there's fuck all else to do
The bosun's mate was Larry
We knew he was a fairy
He caught the sif in Tenerife
And the clap in Buenos Aires
Friggin' in the riggin'
Friggin' in the riggin'
Friggin' in the riggin'
there's fuck all else to do
The first mate's name was Randy
And when he's feeling dandy
He likes to cool his favorite tool
In the gupp of the captain's brandy
Friggin' in the riggin'
Friggin' in the riggin'
Friggin' in the riggin'
there's fuck all else to do
