The girl starts screaming and the temperature is rising
It's just a part of daily life
Mother puts hands into the washing basin
She scrubs away the family tears
She's the rock, the strength, the love for all these years
The father comes and goes and tries to be assertive
He can't be heard above the sound
The sound of barking dogs and plastic fire engines
The queue outside the bathroom door
It will stretch on and on and on forevermore
Angel face rivalry
Or sisterly harmony
The dog's climbing up the tree
I'm chasing a bumblebee
And your mama just wants to know
Have you paid?
Your daddy just needs to know
Who you're seeing
The funny thing in this life
And heaven knows how much longer we'll all be there
Now you will always know
If there's a place where you can call home
Dawn is rising, the Olympic Games have started
The children banging on the wall
Auntie Alex stares, but she'll never be awoken
She's slept through worse than all these years
I try to wake her up, but no, she just can't hear
There's something inside of me
This family identity
It's taking a hold on me
It's my final destiny
And your mother just wants to know
Have you paid?
Your daddy just needs to know
Who you're seeing
The funny thing in this life
Is I still care
So heaven knows how much longer
We'll all be there
Now you will always know
If there is a place where you can call home
And your mother just wants to know of your pain
Your daddy just needs to know who you're seeing
The funny thing in this life is we still care
So heaven knows how much longer we'll all be there
Well, I see you, you see me
Diggin' that family harmony
And I've been through shades of blue
Lovin' all the things we still can do
So take your place in the human race
Turn the other cheek just to save your face
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
