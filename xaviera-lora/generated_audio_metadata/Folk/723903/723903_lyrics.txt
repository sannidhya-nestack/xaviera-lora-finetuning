So many times you've tried to walk away
So sure you couldn't stay
So many tears overflow from my heart
My fear's unguarded
It's time to pretend
Time it will mend
A heart that doesn't know
How it will beat again
So now I'll say goodbye
With a smile and a lie
how I'll be alright
And how I'll get by
Yeah, I'll be okay
Living every day
So now I'll say goodbye
Now I'll say goodbye
With a smile and a lie about how I'll be alright
And how I'll get by, yeah, I'll be okay
Living every day with a smile and a lie
So many dreams held together by a promise
That's now an empty wish
So many words I've heard a hundred echoes
That only my voice knows
It's time to pretend
Time it will mend
A heart that doesn't know
How it will beat again
So now I'll say goodbye
With a smile and a lie
how I'll be alright
And how I'll get by
Yeah, I'll be okay
Living every day
So now I'll say goodbye
With a smile and a lie
About how I'll be alright
And how I'll get by
Yeah, I'll be okay
Living every day
With a smile and a lie
