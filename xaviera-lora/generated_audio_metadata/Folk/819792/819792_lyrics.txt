From before I came to thee
You mothered me
Divine
Is your love
Perfection everywhere
Safe inside
The love you made for me
before I left to walk
You hold my eye
Covered in your love
Save from harm the love you gave to me
The love you gave to me, to me
From before I left to love my own
You sheltered me
Wrong
Protected by your love
I know
I know I know I know I know I know I know
