Every time I get to see you laugh
I know that I would never have enough
The way that you look, the way that you look tonight
Oh, why can't I get you out, out of my mind?
Oh, is this love? Oh, is this love that I feel?
Oh, is this love? Oh, is this love that I feel?
I feel for you
I feel for you
I feel for you
I feel for you
Every time I get to see you laugh
I know that I would never have enough
The way that you look, the way that you look tonight
Oh, why can't I get you out, out of my mind?
Oh is this love, oh is this love that I feel
Oh is this love, oh is this love that I feel
I feel for you
I feel for you
I feel for you
I feel for you
