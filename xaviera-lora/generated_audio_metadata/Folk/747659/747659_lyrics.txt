God sent me an angel
From up above
To teach me right and wrong
And how to love
Trials and tribulations
She kept me strong
God sent me an angel, yeah
And I call her mom
Did you ever see the side of me that made you so ashamed
Well it's all my fault I'm telling you I know you're not to blame
But you look past all the bad in me
And good comes shining through
It's because you're an angel, yeah
And I got it from you
Did you ever see the side of me that made you so ashamed
Well it's all my fault I'm telling you I know you're not to blame
But you look past all the bad in me
And good comes shining through
It's because you're an angel, yeah
And I got it from you
God sent me an angel
And I'm glad it was you
