It isn't love that I'm feeling
Love don't make you feel this way
Midnight staring at the ceiling
Trying to make this heartache go away
And I guess I'm a fool for believing
That anything this fine could come my way
it isn't love
It isn't me that you're needin'
You don't seem to be the needin' kind
Lying close enough to feel you breathing
Knowing I'm the last thing on your mind
And I guess I'm a fool for believing
And I should pack my heart and fly away
it isn't love
There was a time when our passion burned so brightly
Lighting up my loneliness brighter than the day
Love was a line you never would cross over
A prisoner of promises you made your getaway
There was a time when our passion burned so brightly
Lighting up my loneliness brighter than the day
Love was a line you never would cross over
A prisoner of promises you made your getaway
This is a game that we're playing
And I'm the one who's losing out to you
Read between the lines of what you're saying
Any fool would know it isn't true
And I guess I'm a fool for believing
And I should pack my heart and fly away
it isn't love
It isn't love
It isn't love
No, it isn't love
It isn't love, ooh, love, ooh
