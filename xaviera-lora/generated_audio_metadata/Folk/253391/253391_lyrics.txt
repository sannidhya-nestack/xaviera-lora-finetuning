I've been nodding out in my own way, that I do
Frustrated yet willing, still get tired and rude
Said my, said my eyes don't see
It's been all the waiting, a changing, the way that I be
Pretty little child inside
Run, jump and hide
Then beyond my reach I may drown
Before I get to die
But could I, could I
Stay for now
I get warped by the delusions
Of me and my confusions
The light has grown
Lady Voodoo Dawn
Could be a normal life
Still can't be alone
As much as I would really like
Been a long time since I smiled
Myself to sleep
River wide
The mountains steep
Get by, get by
Only way I know how
All the things to reach for
I just can't ignore
And I will walk alone if I have to
Make company in my head
Meet you all when this novel reaches an end
Or can I?
Can I do it naturally
All the things that people say
It doesn't matter anyway
And it's a day gone by
Maybe we ease all the years I've tried
But before I go, I'm gonna let it roll
No need to show my waiting gold
No need to show my waiting gold
No need to show my weight and go low
