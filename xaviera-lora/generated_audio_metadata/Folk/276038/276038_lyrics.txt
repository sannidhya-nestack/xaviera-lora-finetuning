You haven't been gone too long now
Just for a breath of air
To breathe an island trade winds in the rain
And from my window I can see
Your drizzle dampened hair
As I await your wet return
Return to me
Under a big fat moon
That hangs where the stars are
There's nowhere in this world I'd rather be
Than under a big fat moon
Spun of silk and silver water
Up where the clouds are thin
And stars have broken free
The headlights on the distant road illuminate a memory
Of highway songs and stories I once knew
Now it's just music in my head
Those days are gone and every road I travel winds its way to you
Under a big fat moon
That hangs where the stars are
There's nowhere in this world I'd rather be
Than under a big fat moon
Spun of silk and silver water
Up where the clouds are thin
And stars have broken free
You bring bouquets of blooming jasmine
Drenched in your hands
And lay them on my pillow
You carry fistfuls of the moonlight
Shining in your hands
And then you splash it over us
From my open window we can breathe rainy island air
And hear the music of the dark and rising sea
Under the big fat moon it hangs where the stars are
Come close your sleepy eyes and lie with me
Under a big fat moon
Spun of silk and silver water
Up where the clouds have been
And stars have broken free
Under the big fat moon
It hangs where the stars are
There's nowhere in this world I'd rather be
Then under the big, fat moon
Spun of silk and silver water
Up where the clouds are thin
And stars have broken free
Up where the clouds are thin
And stars have broken free
Mahina moko polu polu o
Mahina moko polu polu o
Mahina moko polu polu o
Mahina moko polu o
