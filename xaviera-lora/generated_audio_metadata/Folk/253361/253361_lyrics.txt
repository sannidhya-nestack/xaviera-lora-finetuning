If you're traveling to the North Country Bear
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Please say hello to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine
And if you're going where the snowflakes fall
Where rivers freeze and summers end
Please see for me she'll be wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from howling wind
Please see for me that her hair is hanging down
That it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me that her hair is hanging down
For that is the way that I remember her best
Sometimes I wonder if she remembers me at all
All the many times that I have often prayed
Through the darkness of my night
And through the brightness of my day
So if you're traveling to the North Country Fire
And where the wind's hit heavy on the board
Please say hello to one who lives there
For she once was a true lover of mine
For she once was a true lover of mine
For she once was a true lover
Mine
