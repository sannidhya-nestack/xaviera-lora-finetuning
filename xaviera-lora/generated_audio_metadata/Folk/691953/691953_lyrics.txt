I left things behind when I put my foot forward
For life is defined by the brave not the coward
Things weren't the same they in fact got much better
For change is a game that rewards a go-getter
Home is not a place or a time
Because home is
In your heart and your mind
It's true that I cried once it hit home I'm going
I staggered unsteady the patient winds blowing
It's tough to move on though we made sacrifices
I've tallied the cost still don't know what the price is
Not a place or a time
Because home is
In your heart and your mind
Home is
Not a line on the sand
Because home is
In the palm of your hand
Hold me closer
Keep me in your dreams
Hold me closer
Keep me in your dreams, dream, dream
So many words lie between us
Can't they be just like a bridge
Chains that were once underneath us
Have just freed us like the wind, like the wind
Home is not a place or a time
Because home is in your heart and your mind
Home is not a line on the sand
Because home is
In the palm of your hand
