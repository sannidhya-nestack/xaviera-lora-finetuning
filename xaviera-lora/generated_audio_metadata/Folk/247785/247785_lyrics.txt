They say a coal miner's daughter is a good friend indeed
her papa might land you the job that you need
If you pass his inspection, the ticket he'll read
every coal mine is measured by the lips that it feeds
And now we're working the shop at Wabamalake
I'm another electrician, gold miners pay
After fixing equipment, there's a man in the pit
We'll head out to the gain-fert, we'll all drink a bit
Let's drink to wide open spaces and familiar faces
And fishing through holes in the ice
Towards unlaxed in admissions through white woodwork fishing
Turning coal into diamonds and northern lights
Well my father before me and his before
He standing deep in the hole before turning fifteen
They were working for peanuts and breaking their backs
Till alone came the sun dancing wobbling stacks
So the next generation
New to the game, built these generators stations
The stones threw away and the drag lines made mountains
The coal disappeared, we'll move more in a week than they could in a year
While the miners keep digging, we tend to the rigging
We work hard but we won't work for free
We'll make union decisions and constant revisions
So the steel workers deep in the sea
Can keep chasing those coal miners' dreams
Let's drain two wide open spaces and
Vermillion faces and fish in through holes in the ice
Towards all accident missions
Through whitewood road fishing
Turning coal into diamonds and northern lights
Turning coal into diamonds and northern lights
With computer's compassion
The scheduler's forms have been laser surveyin'
The prospector's daughter's and the coal miner's daughter
Is pregnant again while the whitewoods exhausted in 2010
If we've learned from the past, no coal miner'll last
The son of a coal miner's daughter
Since our genesis bridge, guess we'll leave Siva beach
we'll never make blood out of water
And we'll never make coal out of stone (never make coal out of stone)
But I've married that coal miner's daughter
Guess we're leaving our warbler below
Let's drink to wide open spaces and familiar faces
And fishing through holes in the ice
Towards unlike-seen ambitions
Through whitewood we're fishing
Turning coal into diamonds and northern lights
Turning coal into diamonds and northern lights
Turning coal into diamonds and northern lights
Turning coal into diamonds and northern lights
Northern lights
Northern lights
Northern Lights
