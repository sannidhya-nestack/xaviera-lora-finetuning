She will always break your heart
Phantom voices, why don't you listen?
You'd rather let her rip you to pieces
She's got this way about her that's tragic
And you would do anything and take it on the chin
Time after time and again
Just to feel that magic
She will always break your heart
No matter what you do
She will always break your heart
She will tear you apart
She will tear you apart
She will always break your heart
And you would hold your breath and die
If she wanted you to
Wait for her to give you a sign or let you turn
Another shade of blue, that's what she'd do
And you could walk through a thousand lives
And never once have true love
Faint by her touch, completely overwhelmed
She would never know of it, she would never know of it
Good God you just can't control it
She will always break your heart
No matter what you do
She will always break your heart
She will tear you apart
She will tear you apart
She will always break your heart
