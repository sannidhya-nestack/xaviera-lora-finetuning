Hang down your head Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Hang down your head Tom Dooley
Poor boy you're bound to die
He met her on that mountain
There he took her life
He met her on that mountain
He stabbed her with his knife
Hang down your head Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Hang down your head Tom Dooley
Poor boy you're bound to die
'Bout this time tomorrow
Reckon where he'll be
Down in that lonesome valley
Hanging from that tall oak tree
Hang down your head Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Hang down your head Tom Dooley
Poor boy you're bound to die
Hang down your head Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Hang now, you'll hear Tom Dooley
Poor boy, you're bound to die
