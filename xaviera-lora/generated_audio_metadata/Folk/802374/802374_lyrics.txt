No, I don't want, I don't wanna play it no more
I don't wanna fake it no more
This miracle of life and I am too far
Far away from the truth
I would like to say it to you every day
Know what I can do
Can't I be singing no more
I can’t ever hear it no more, it’s happening again
Why do you know, all this is what it is
I guess it is up to me now, to become
This time in love, an angel that you want me to believe
If you can't keep a secret, I'll tell you I am in
This smiling face could easily be understood
The smartest people move it to the other room
you don't want anybody around to see
What you tell me to be
This charming, loving angel that you want me to believe
If you can keep a secret then I tell you I am in
This charming loving angel that you want me to believe
If you can keep a secret then I tell you I am in
