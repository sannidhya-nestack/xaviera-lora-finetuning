We hear the wind blowin', it brings us your name
We'll keep the fire goin', you're findin' your way
We're hearing the pounding, the beating of war
We're sending our people, we've heard this before
Hey yeah, hey yeah-ee
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Snow is falling, our hearts are almost broken
We've been calling and spirit wind has spoken
It's coming down and we'll take this fine token
Of you coming home to your own
We hear the wind blowin'
It brings a new name
It tells us that freedom is makin' her way
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Snow is falling, our hearts are almost broken
We've been calling, and spirit wind has spoken
It's coming down, and we'll take this fine token
Of you coming home to your own
We'll fly up higher than eagles
Our hearts will shine like the sun
We'll shine like the sun
We'll spread our arms out to greet you
As you fall to the ground
Little one, little one
Snow is falling, our hearts are almost broken
We've been calling and spirit wind has spoken
It's coming down
Snow is falling, our hearts are almost broken
We've been calling, and spirit wind has spoken
It's coming down, and we'll take this fine token
Of you coming home to your own
