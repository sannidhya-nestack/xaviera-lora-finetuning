The sun sets on the sea tonight
And leaves its pure golden ray
We're here on the beach alone
And you're begging me to stay
That sea keeps calling out to me
Making whispers in the night
The choice is very hard to make
I just want to see the light
I just want to see the light
The moon on the water glistens with might
Cozies into Baja Bay
And now I know what I must do
She's calling me away
She's calling me away
Go far, far away
Oh wind sail, oh my wind sail
I built you with my hands
You keep me free and let me be
Let's go to other lands
You keep calling me away
You keep calling me away
Go far away to stay
The anchor's up, the ropes are in
The sails in full bloom above
And I look back to the dark and see
The woman that I love
The woman that I love
She's begging me to stay
Not go that far away
But that sea keeps calling out to me
Making whispers in the night
The choice is hard to make
Is it her or the sail so bright?
Her or the sail so bright
Her or the sail so bright
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
