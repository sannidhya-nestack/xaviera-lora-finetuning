Light suitcase and a smile
Stepping up into relief
Battle's over for a while
It's gonna be
This train and me
Got a real good book to read
Piece of paper and a pen, ooh yeah
Tickets money all I need
To be free
This train's my friend
I just love that feeling
When it picks up speed
Like the lights dimmin'
Before I'm moving
A seed that's growing
Going to my baby
Oh yeah, here I come
Mmm
I have earned my key
Lots of work, too little sleep
I deserve this feel
Going to my baby
Countryside is racing by
Wheels beating to my heart
Foreign couple bumping right
And it feels
Like another start
I just love that yearning
This turning down below
Oh, twisting and turning
I feel it grow
A river that's flowing
Going to my baby
I have earned my key
Lots of work but too little sleep
I deserve this leave
Go into my baby
Go into my baby
Going to my baby
