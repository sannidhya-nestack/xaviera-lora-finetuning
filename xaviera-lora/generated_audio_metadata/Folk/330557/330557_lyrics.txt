I like the way you look at me every time
You first come into my mind
I like the way you fit perfectly on my side
I like the way you hold my hand
And bury your head in my chest
Every time you're tired
Every time you want to rest
I like the way your face looks when you sleep
I like your legs crossed over me
I like how you always want me to win
I like how you touch my skin
I like you, you
Oh I like you
How else do I tell you?
I like the way you always ask for another song
And how we always get along
I like how you dress for me
I wish you could see what I see
I like how you're slow to get into the pool
Oh, I like to hold you when you do
I like the way you smile at me
I wish the whole world could see I like you
You, oh I like you
How else can I tell you
I like you, you, oh I like you
How else do I tell you
I like you, you, I like you
How else do I tell you
I like the way you walk into a room
Like how people look at you
Like in your ski clothes and warm hair
Like how you talk in your accent
I like the way you dance with me
I like how you lack family
I like how you inspire me
I like you so much can't you see
Can't you see, can't you see
Can't you see, I like you
Can't you see, can't you see
Can't you see, can't you see
