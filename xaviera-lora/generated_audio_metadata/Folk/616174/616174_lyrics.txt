Angel on the road
Wings of dreams and steel
Strong, dynamic, bold
Yet humble, unassuming, silently it fares
Over spills and potholes, seemingly unaware
It's a gift of love, the product of care
Grey simplicity
Born from wealth and means
Lovely hybrid thing
Once so dependent on fathers of greed
Now transcendent to foster to seed
A new kind of world, a better breed
See what changes hence
Bonding, work, well-being
Beauty, common sense
Look there it goes again, gliding down the road
In the driver's seat a boy, laughing as he goes
Waving to disbelievers, gawking from afar
Neil's car, Neil's car
Neil's car
Neil's car
