And as she danced, the angels gathered'round
And when she sang, tremors cracked the ground
She was the morning, the dawning and the day
Then she just left
She has flown away
Come away with me, Samantha
Come away with me and ride
And when she talks, she don't make a scene
But when she walks
All the leaves turn green
She has the fire
Of turning night to day
And she just left
She has flown away
Come away with me, Samantha
Come away with me and ride
