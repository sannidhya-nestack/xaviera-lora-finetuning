I don't care anymore
I think I've lost my touch
And I know what a smile is worth
But I don't have that much
I know, I know, know, know
Oh Lord
I can't be sad for this
I do it to myself
Tattered and torn, yet lingering
As dust gathers on my shell
Oh no, no, no, no
Oh Lord
Time has become irrelevant
A chasm in my mind
I sit and wait so patiently
A simple stretch of sublime
A simple stitch of zip line
A simple stitch of zip line, I know
Oh no, no, no
Oh Lord, I know
Oh no, no, no
Oh Lord, oh no
Oh Lord, oh no, no
Oh love, no, no, no
