Shady Grove, my little love, shady Grove I say
Shady Grove, my little love, bound to go away
Cheeks as red as a blooming rose and eyes as pretty as brown
She's the darling of my heart, sweetest girl in town
Shady Grove, my little love, shady Grove, I say
Shady Grove, my little love, bound to go away
I wish I had a big fine horse and corn to feed him on
Shady Grove to stay at home and feed him while I'm gone
Shady Grove my little love, shady Grove I say
Shady Grove my little love, I'm bound to go away
Went to see my Shady Grove, she was standing in the door
Her shoes and stockings in her hand, her little bare feet on the floor
Shady Grove my little love, Shady Grove I say
Shady Grove my little love, I'm bound to go away
When I was a little boy I wanted a Barlow knife
Not one little shady grove to say she'll be my wife
Shady Grove my little love, shady grove I say
Shady Grove my little love, I'm bound to go away
Kiss from pretty little Shady Grove
The sweetest brandy wine
There ain't no girl in this old world
That's prettier than mine
Shady Grove my little love
Shady Grove I say
Shady Grove my little love
I'm bound to go away
Shady Grove my little love
Shady Grove I say
Shady Grove my little love
I'm bound to go away
