This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine
Let it shine
Everywhere I go
I'm gonna let it shine everywhere I go
I'm gonna let it shine everywhere I go
I'm gonna let it shine, let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
Not gonna make it shine
Gonna let it shine
Not gonna make it shine, no
Gonna let it shine
Not gonna make it shine
Gonna let it shine, let it shine, let it shine, oh let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
Out in the dark, I'm gonna let it shine
Out in the dark, I'm gonna let it shine
Out in the dark, I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
