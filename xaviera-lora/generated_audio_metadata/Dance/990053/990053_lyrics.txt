You got me right where you want me at
You got me right where you want me at
You got me right where you want me at
You got me right where you want me at
Spread my hair, tell me, tell me what you want me, to be
Say you wanna love me, right here, tell me are you ready, oh
I don't wanna play no, no games, I've been working hard all day
I just wanna kick back and play under the moonlight woah
You got me right where you want me at
You got me right where you want me at
You got me right where you want me at
You got me right where you want me at
Spread my hair, tell me, tell me what you want me to be
Say you wanna love me, right here, tell me are you ready oh
I don't wanna play no, no games
I've been working hard all, all day
I just wanna kick back
And play under the moonlight, woah
