Take me tonight on an escapade
Now is the time to go far away
Don't look behind it's a big mistake
Let's get away
Hold, hold, hold, hold
Hold me in your arms
Look into the stars so bright
Reach into your heart
And open your eyes
Let's keep moving on
Leave your troubles in the past
Now we've just begun
We can make it last
So take me tonight on an escapade
Now is the time to go far away
Don't look behind it's a big mistake
Let's get away
Take me tonight on an escapade
Now is the time to go far away
Don't look behind, it's a big mistake
Let's get away
Everything's alright
A new adventure's just begun
And it's looking fine
Under the sun
We'll be running free
There's no sense in looking back
Won't you come with me?
We can make it last
We can make it last
Take me tonight on an escapade
Now is the time to go far away
Don't look behind it's a big mistake
Let's get away
Take me tonight on an escapade
Now is the time to go far away
Don't look behind it's a big mistake
Let's get away
Oh, let's get away
Let's get away
Oh, let's get away
Let's get away
Let's get away
