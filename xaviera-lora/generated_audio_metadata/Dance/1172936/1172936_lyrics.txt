You got that fire in your eyes again
That look you get when you got something to say
Come on now baby don't hold it in
Yeah you got my full attention
You know you kill me when you shoot from the hip
Your aim is perfect girl you'll never miss
When you call me out it works every time
So just say what's on your mind
Tell me I'm wrong, tell me you're right
Tell me you thought about telling me goodbye
Tell me to get it together, tell me to change
Tell me you can't live like this another day
Tell me how lucky I am, tell me I'm no Romeo
Baby tell me something I don't know
Oh, baby tell me
Tell me something I don't know
Oh, baby tell me
I'm not real good about reading your mind
My crystal ball can't show me what's in your heart
Sit down beside me boy we got time
To spend the night just talking
Tell me you're scared, tell me I'm strong
Tell me you can't live a minute if I'm gone
Tell me I could've done better, tell me I'm chic
Tell me how my kisses make your knees go weak
Tell me how wild I am
Tell me you won't let go
Baby tell me something I don't know
Oh, oh, oh
Baby tell me
Tell me something I don't know
Oh, oh, oh
Baby tell me
When we're good, we're golden
Nothing can get in our way
Let's not let things go unspoken
Say what we need to say
Tell me am you one and only
Tell me you're proud
Tell me what we have will never ever run out
Tell me you're not keeping score
Tell me the same
Tell me the world is ours each and every day
Tell me we're bulletproof
Tell me I'm your heart and soul
Baby tell me something I don't know
Oh, baby tell me
Tell me something I don't know
Oh, baby tell me
Tell me something I don't know
Oh, baby tell me
Tell me something I don't know
Oh, baby tell me
Tell me something I don't know
