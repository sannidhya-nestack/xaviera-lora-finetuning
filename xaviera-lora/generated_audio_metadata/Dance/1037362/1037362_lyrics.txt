Oh I sink and drown in you
Oh, I sit and drown in you
You're the type that doesn't back down
Don't say I don't get how I look
I'll show you how I earn my crown
And you fall again for my sharp hook
Don't get me out, don't get me out
I will do something terrible
Don't tell me you, don't tell me you
Took my number by mistake
I'll show you how, I'll show you how
Show you how to fix me up
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Or worse I can drown
Or worse I can drown
Or worse I can drown, drown
Oh, I just can't drown in you, hmm
Oh, I just can't drown
Oh, I just can't drown in you
I can't drown
You're the type that doesn't back down
Don't say a tongue at how I look
I'll show you how I earned my crown
And you're far again from my side, hook
