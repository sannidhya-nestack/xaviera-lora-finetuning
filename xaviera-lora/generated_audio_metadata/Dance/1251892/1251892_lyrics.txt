Glimmer in the moonlight
Echoing your heartbeats
We're chasing stars, won't touch the ground
we're soaring past the speed of light
So take my hand, let's own the night, we won't fall
And I know we've got that inner fire
We're standing tall, we're standing tall
We're standing, never in the moonlight
Echoing your heartbeats
We're chasing stars, won't touch the ground
we're soaring past the speed of light
So take my hand, let's own the night
We won't fall
And I know we've got that inner fire
We're standing tall, we're standing tall
We're standing tall
This city never knew a love so bright
When we're together we ignite
Through every high and every low
We're invincible, watch us glow
Take my hand, let's own the night
We won't let go
