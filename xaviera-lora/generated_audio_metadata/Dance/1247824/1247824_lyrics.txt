Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Stars are shining bright above
In the moonlight we find love
Feel the rhythm in the air
Take my hand let's go somewhere
Hearts are beating fast as one
Underneath this midnight sun
Twirl and spin just me and you
Let the night it see us through
Moonlight dance we're lost in time
Melodies we start to rhyme
Hold me close let's feel the chance
In the night we moonlight dance
Ooh, ooh, ooh, moonlight dance, we're lost in time
Ooh, ooh, melodies, we start to rhyme
Ooh, ooh, hold me close, let's feel the chance
In the night we moonlight dance
Footsteps echo on the ground
Silence is our only sound
In your eyes I see a spark
Guiding us here in the dark
The world outside just fades away
All we need is where we stay
In this moment here with you
Every dream it will come true
Moonlight dance we're lost in time
Melodies we start to rhyme
Hold me close let's feel the chance
In the night we moonlight dance
Ooh, ooh, ooh, moonlight dance, we're lost in time
Ooh, ooh, ooh, melodies, we start to rhyme
Ooh, ooh, ooh, hold me close, let's feel the chance
In the night, we moonlight dance
Ooh, ooh, ooh, moonlight dance
Ooh, ooh, ooh
World outside just fades away
All we need is where we stay
In this moment here with you
Every dream it will come true
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Moonlight dance, we're lost in time
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, the melodies will start to rhyme
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hold me close let's feel the chance
In the night we moonlight dance
