Evening hums a tender hymn across the meadow, I
Silver dust of fireflies drifts on the twilight tide
You traced a laughing clover where the rusty fence divides
Tied a ribbon to a willow cell, let's teach the wind to glide
You pressed the sky between two palms and folded up the light
Then handed me a promise shaped like dreams in silent flight
Heartbeat quick as crickets, hope as weightless as a sigh
We let go of doubting shadows, raised our wishes to the sky
Fly, fly, little paper kite
Ride the hush of velvet night
Carry every whispered prayer
Higher than a summer fair
Oh, dance beyond the candle glow
Where the gentle breezes blow
Hold our love in open
Fly, fly, little paper kite
Moon spilled milk on pasture hills
The barn roof caught the gleam
Owls kept watching silent pews
While we unraveled dream
You said a morning steals the magic
But it never steals a spark
So we tied a knot in sunrise
Just to save a piece of dark
Hardly quick as crickets
Dawn is knocking on the gate
But that fragile, fluttered promise knows
That dawn can simply wait
Fly, fly, little paper kite, ride the hush of velvet night
Carry every whispered prayer higher than the summer fair
Oh, dance beyond the candle below where the gentle breeze is low
Hold our love and open, fly, fly, little paper kite
If the strings should ever falter, drifting far from earthly view
I'll trace the turning constellations'til they point me back to you
For every tear that falls like rain, the wind will lift it clean
Stitch it to the starlight in the fabric of unseen
Fly, fly, little paper kite
Ride the hush of velvet night
Carry every whispered prayer
Higher than a summer fair
Oh, let's dance beyond the candle glow
Where the gentle breezes blow
Hold on love and open flight, flight
Little paper kite
Soar into the dawn like brushes linger where the dreams ignite
Love will keep you ever rising
Gentle little paper kite
