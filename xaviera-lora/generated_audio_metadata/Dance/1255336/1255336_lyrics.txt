Darting through the city of connections, we're witty
Long speech racing, whole world chasing
Rigs flash, parts clash like Titans
Great flicks on the wrist, time rip
Got that brush, no fuss, double dutch
Converse deep peaks, loves in March
Motion in the ocean
Potion of devotion
Seating on highways
Loving on sideways
Zoom calls to moon falls
Night crawl
Number of cyber halls
Text installed
Hearts linked
Synced like bluetooth
Fast track
No slack
Undisputed truth
Rapping out
Can't get enough
Final entrance
No suspensions
Link in this
Electric kiss
Rapping love can't get enough, feel not flying, never trying
Paradise speeding, hearts unleading, shh
Full day that's against the romance, lightning on veins
No restraints, cupid's arrow Ferrari
No sorrow, quick thrills, no tomorrow
Chasing fast, titan blast, flames roar
Can't ignore, ask the wolf
Swipe right, ignite snipe right
DM delight, feel that slight
Fast forwarded sense, no defense
Love hacked without pretence
Low speed, fulfilling need
Pure breed, blinks pace
Hearts race, loves a chase
Rapping love can't get enough
Funneled engines, no suspension
Link in this electric kiss
Rapping love can't get enough
Feel hot flying, never trying
Paradise speeding, hearts unbeating
Rapid love, can't get enough
Throttled engines, no suspension
Blink and miss, electric kiss
Rapid love, can't get enough
Feel how I'm flying, never trying
Paradise speeding, heart's unweeding
