Darkness fades, a new dawn is breaking
Positive vibes, a fresh start I'm making
No more dwelling on sadness and pity
Time to embrace life's radiant beauty
Shedding that negative self doubt
I'll be lifting my spirit no more living in drought
A rebirth is happening from deep within
New opportunities are just about to begin
I'm growing up, letting my light shine
Manifesting the blessings that will soon be mine
Elevating my mindset, leaving the past behind
Choosing gratitude, breathing in life's simple joy
Affirmations kickstarting my transformation
Self love igniting my life's bright celebration
A misery will fill them leaving the past behind
Seizing pride to breathe in irresistible joy
Affirmations kick starting our transformation
Self love igniting my life's bright celebration
No reason we will dim down my warm rays
I'm soaring forward onto positive pathways
Embracing my flaws and perfections made perfect
Releasing toxic patterns I no longer need to protect
Unapologetic in my quest for jubilance
Allowing the universe's magic to enhance
I'm glowing up
Letting my light shine
(Dark shine)
Manifesting the blessings that will soon be mine
(Finding light)
Elevating my mindset
Leaving the past behind
Soothing gratitude
Breathing in life's simple joy
Oh, like a phoenix rising from the ash
Of life's trials and emotional crashes
I'm being reborn into my truest self
Allowing the universe's magic to enhance
Like a phoenix rising from the ash of life's trials and emotional crashes
I'm being reborn into my truest self
No critics or setbacks will hold my wealth
I'm glowing up
Letting my light shine (let it shine)
Manifesting the blessings that will soon be mine (soon be mine)
Elevating my mindset, leaving the past behind
Truth in gratitude
Breathing in life's simple joys, ooh, ah, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm going up, letting my light shine
Manifesting the blessings that will soon be mine
I'm letting my mind set, leaving the past behind
Choosing gratitude, breathing in life's sinful joy
