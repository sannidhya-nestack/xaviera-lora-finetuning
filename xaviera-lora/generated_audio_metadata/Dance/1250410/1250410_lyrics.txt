She walks in sparkles bright
Every step the flash of light
Eyes on her she owns the night
She's got that magic fire all right
Lipstick lit her heels so high
Catching dreams she reaches sky
Planning plans for me to try
She leaves a trail of wonder why
Glamour girl she's shining bright
Turning heads in every light
Dancing through the starry night
Glamour girl all pure delight
Her laughter goes silver bells
Mystery in the tales she tells
A world of dreams where she dwells
No one breaks her spell
Clamor girl she's shining bright
Turning heads in every light
Dancing through the starry night
Glamour girl of pure delight
Her laughter echoes to the best
Mystery in the tales she tells
A world of dreams where she dwells
No one breaks her spells
Glamour girl she's shining bright
Turning heads in every light
Dancing through the starry night
Climb a girl out your daylight
Have a girl you treat she'll stay
Leading hearts to find their way
In her glow, sway and play
Climb a girl don't fade away
Glamour girl in dreams she'll stay
Leading hearts to find their way
In a global sway and play
Glamour girl don't fade away
Glamour girl she's shining bright
Turning heads in every light
Dancing through the starry night
Glamour girl I'm your daylight
Glamour girl she's shining bright
Turning heads in every light
Dancing through the starry night
Glamour girl, I'm trapped in love
Glamour girl, in dreams she'll stay
Bleeding hearts to find their way
In her clothes, sway and play
Glamour girl, don't fade away
She walks in, sparkles bright
Their feet stop, the flash of light
Eyes on her, she owns the night
She's got that magic vibe, alright
Lipstick wear, her heels so high
Catching dreams, she reaches sky
Nothing press, no need to try
She feels the dread of wonder, why?
Who's the girl that heals so hard?
Can't she dream she'll reach the sky?
Glamour creates the need to try
She feels the dread of wonder, why?
Glamour girl, the dream she'll stay
Bleeding hearts to find their way
In a glorious way and play
Glamour girls don't fade away
Her laughter a colour silver else
Mystery in the tales she tells
The world of dreams where she dwells
No one breaks her spells
