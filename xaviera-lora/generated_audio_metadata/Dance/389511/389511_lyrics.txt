Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Shake your body baby, move your body baby
Shake your body baby, let me see you moving
Shake your body baby, move your body baby
Shake your body baby, let me see you moving
Moving groups from place to place come face to face
With every race USA to the UK
We're breaking charts along the way
Laurie Vaughan has got the voice
Break a dawn the voice of choice
Jay's music makes you sway
In a way you can't display
So shake your body unify
Let me see you pump it high
Take this party to the max
Come on fellas in the back
Now ladies now don't be shady
Shake and drive those fellas crazy
Everybody get somebody
Erase the race and taste the party
Shake your body baby, move your body baby
Shake your body baby, let me see you moving
Shake your body baby, move your body baby
Shake your body baby, let me see you moving
Gon' come together, gon' stay forever
Gon' come together, gon' stay forever
Gon' come together, gon' stay forever
Gon' come together
Gon' stay forever
Shake your body baby
Move your body baby
Shake your body baby
Let me see you moving
Shake your body baby
Move your body baby
Shake your body baby
Let me see you moving
Gon' come together
Gonna stay forever
Gonna come together
Gonna stay forever
Shut your body baby
Move your body baby
Shut your body baby
Let me see you moving
Shut your body baby
Move your body baby
Shut your body baby
Let me see you moving
Shut your body baby
Move your body baby
Shut your body baby
Let me see you moving
Shut your body baby, move your body baby
Shut your body baby, let me see you move it
Shut your body baby, move your body baby
Shut your body baby, let me see you move it
Shut your body baby, move your body baby
Shut your body baby, let me see you move It
