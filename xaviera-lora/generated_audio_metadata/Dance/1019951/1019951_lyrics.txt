Too late to be a child prodigy
Too old to be young and married
Maybe I picked at nineteen
Oh oh oh
Taking it one step at a time
Too reckless to align
Distracted by the high, oh, oh, oh, oh
Some may call it fate or destiny, oh
But I'm where I'm meant to be
I'm where I'm meant to be (I'm where I'm meant to be)
I'm where I'm meant to be (I am where I'm meant to be)
Am I losing my desire?
Can I set my goals on fire
Want to be someone I admire
Oh, oh
Taking it one step at a time
As opportunity arrives
Focused on the drive, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Some may call it fate or destiny, oh
But I'm where I'm meant to be
I'm where I'm meant to be
Where I'm meant to be (Where I'm meant to be)
Where I'm meant to be (Where I'm meant to be)
A blunt knife through solid rust
Cutting through but I still felt lost
A blunt knife through solid ground
But now I'm found, oh
Some may call it fate or destiny, oh
But I'm where I'm meant to be
I'm where I'm meant to be
I'm where I'm meant to be
I'm where I'm meant to be
I'm where I'm meant to be
