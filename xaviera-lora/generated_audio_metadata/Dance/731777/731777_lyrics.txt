I woke up tonight
Got a dream that you were laying at my side
You and me tonight
We'll love each other till it's alright
We'll move into the light
We all wanna party
We all wanna dance the night away
We all wanna
We don't wanna party, we don't stop, never stop, never give it up
We are gonna dance, we'll be friends, stay friends, get into a trance
We don't wanna holla, I call up, give you ring and you're gone up
You and me together, forever and ever
Just come with me now
I got a feeling that you and me, we're all about
Just stay with me now
Stay this way and I'll be okay, just stay this way
I can feel how it's supposed to be
You wanna be with me, I wanna stay forever
Loving me like you used to be
We gonna feel so free
Let's dance forever, do it again
I wanna see you again
Tonight we're going again
Let's stay this way together
Hold me close, feel like an overdose
I just hope it shows
Come on let's stay together
We all want, we want, we can do it, we can make it
We all want some more, get your body on the dance floor
Get your body on the dance floor
We all want a party
We all want to dance the night away
We all want a
Party, we all wanna dance the night away
I know how you feel, we gonna get so real
We are gonna party, it's love that we conceal
Come on baby girl, it's you and me in this world
We are gonna dance, baby come on now and clap your hands
Show me everything you can
I just wanna be with you
And be the best man that I can
We all wanna party
We all wanna dance the night away
We all wanna party
We all wanna dance the night away
