Driving with the city far behind
Memories of us playing on my mind
Every mile I take feels like a thousand years
Running from the shadows of my rear view mirrors
Neon lights are fading and the mirrors glare
Echoes of our love hanging in the air
In the quiet whispers the night hears
I'm haunted by the ghost of my rearview fears
Rearview views to night years
I'm haunted by the ghost of my rearview fears
Review fears chasing me tonight
In the darkness searching for the light
Every road I take leads me back to tears
Can't escape the past and my review fears
Raindrops on the windshield light tears in the sky
Watch the lower traces of our last goodbye
Bags, sleeves, cardboard, and we meet here
Misty days I see my mother, I feel your fears
Neon lights, my face, I see my memories
The neon lights are fading and the mirror's glad
Echoes of a love hanging in the air
In the quiet whispers the night hears
I'm haunted by the ghost of my rearview mirrors
Review fears chasing me tonight
In the darkness searching for the light
Every wrong I take leads me back to tears
Can't escape the past and my review fears
As the dawn is breaking and the shadows start to fade
Left with the memories of the love you made
Though the future's calling and we're all in fears
It's a love that came back, like a review of fears
In the rearview, fading like a dream
Moving forward, life's a brand new theme
Listening, the future calls to me
Now I'm losing those rear view mirrors
