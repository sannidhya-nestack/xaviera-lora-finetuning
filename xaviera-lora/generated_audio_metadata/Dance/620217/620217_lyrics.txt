Take me up high, straight up to the ceiling
It's heaven to me, and I'm loving this feeling
Take me up high, up to the ceiling
It's heaven to me
I've been working hard a whole week straight
There's one thing on my mind (one thing on my mind)
All work no play, you know what they say
I'm ready to unwind (to unwind)
The DJ has a way, he knows just what to play
To chase my blues away
I'm into that booming bass
As the floor vibrates
So into the, so into the, so into the party
Take me up high
Straight up to the ceiling
It's heaven to me
And I'm loving this feeling
Take me up high
Up to the ceiling, it's heaven to me
And I'm lovin' this feelin'
Oh, I'm lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin' this feelin'
Yes, I'm lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin' this feelin'
I'm lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin' this feelin'
I'm lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin' this feelin'
The place is packed, everybody's up
And we ain't coming down, no (we ain't coming down)
We won't have enough'til the sun comes up
And the DJ works us out (works us out)
Now we have a way, he knows just what to play
To chase my blues away
Get into that booming bass
As the storm vibrates
So into the, so into the, so into the party
So DJ, take me up high
Straight up to the ceiling
It's heaven to me
And I'm loving this feeling
Take me up high
Up to the ceiling, it's heaven to me
And I'm loving this feeling
Oh, I'm loving, loving, loving, loving this feeling
Yes, I'm loving, loving, loving, loving this feeling
I'm loving, loving, loving, loving this feeling
I'm loving, loving, loving, loving this feeling
I'll be alright, I'll be alright, I'll be alright
