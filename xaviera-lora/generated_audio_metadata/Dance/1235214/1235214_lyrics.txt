Come alive inside with what I feel
We're taking flight in this endless moment
Everything feels right
We're dancing soaring high
Breaking free of nothing to see
Breaking free of boundless energy
Breaking free of nothing to see
Breaking free of boundless energy
We are number one, we are number one, we are number one, we are number one, we are number one, we are number one
Collide inside with what I see
We're taking flight in this endless moment
Everything feels right
We're dancing soaring high
Breaking free from the darkness that you see
Breaking free from the boundless energy
Breaking free from the darkness that you see
Breaking free from the boundless energy
Breaking free from the darkness that you see
Breaking free from the boundless energy
