Your look hit me hard sparks fly
Eyes locked feels like the sky
Heartbeat racing can't deny
Power in your grandson eye
Every step you take so close
Time stops nobody knows
Whispers in my mind it flows
Magic in the way you pose
Hit me hard like a bolt
Can't resist, no control
Hit me hard, feel the jolt
In your eyes I find my soul
No escape from this thrill
Every moment standing still
Wanting you can't get my feel
We're flying high at our will
Hit me hard like a bomb
Can't resist no control
Hit me hard feel the jolt
In your eyes I find my soul
No escape from this thrill
Every moment standing still
Wanting you, can't get my fill
We're flying high at our will
Hit me hard, like a bolt
Can't resist, no control
Hit me hard, feel the jolt
In your eyes I find my soul
Your look hit me hard tonight
Dancing in the city lights
Love's spark burnin' so bright
Hold me as we take flight
Your look hit me hard tonight
Dancing in the city lights
The love spark burning so bright
Hold me as we take flight
