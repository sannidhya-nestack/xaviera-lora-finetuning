Electric nights, we're feeling high
Dancing under flashing lights
Fire in the eyes, oh no disguise
Feel it pulse, feel it rise
Move your hips with my heartbeat
Baseline groove on repeat
In the shadows we're alive
Feel my vibe, feel my vibe
Feel your vibe, it's electric
Come alive, it's kinetic
Take a ride on this hot tide
Feel your vibe, feel your vibe
Keep this rising body sway
Knee on love in the alleyway
Lost in sound, sky so wide
Feel it here, deep inside
Break away, no need for words
Let the rhythm take us onward
In this moment we collide
Feel your vibe, feel your vibe
Moonlight falls and shredding skin
Whispers lost amid the din
And every touch is magnified
Feel your vibe, feel your vibe
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Feel your vibe, feel your vibe
Moonlight falls on sweating skin
Whispers lost amid the din
Every touch is magnified
Feel your vibe, feel your vibe
Moonlight falls and sweat is still
Whispers lost and winter too
Every touch is magnified
Feel your vibe, feel your vibe
Moonlight falls and sweat is still
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Feel your vibe, feel your vibe
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
