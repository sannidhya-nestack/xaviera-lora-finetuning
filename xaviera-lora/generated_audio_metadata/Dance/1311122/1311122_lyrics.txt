L-G-B, every groove feel it flowin'
Under close to our bright blue skies, music blowin'
From the soul of the house, let it shine
In the factory, we're pigeons in the swine
Let the soulful sounds rise
In the dance, we find our size
Feel the bass, let the heart ignite
Soul of house, we're takin' flight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Inside of them melodies of gold
True passion lives in each of us, oh
Faced with groundless and thirsting
In their fragments, music to the very end
Echoes of your youth
Like it
That they resonate in all youth
The best is death, that's all I know
So sad, oh, but shy, this is the truth
The shine, oh, drinks, that's heartache
I love the show, oh, but I'll skip it now, can't do
Watch out, so when you're me, baby, sink your shoe
Both your hands need to be nice to try to do
Both your soul went to my stains, I gotta chew
et it all
Ik wil sitkast land
Wil I never play
Smysel van
Mo me dat la
Golden Dairy Oars
For me like it glows
Liskit dus, liskit dus et je pleer
Je vo' sa, je vo' sa, je vo' sa man ponien
Je vo' sa, je vo' sa, je vo' sa man ponien
Je vo' sa, je vo' sa, je vo' sa man ponien
Je vo' sa, je vo' sa, je vo' sa man ponien
