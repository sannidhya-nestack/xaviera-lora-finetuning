I feel so high
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I feel so high
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh, yeah
et the stress, get in the jet
Waiting for my private snack
Got you always on my back
Jewel diamonds on my neck
We're floating on a bow tech
No worries'bout a price tag
Spending like a brunette
Step by step by night day
Sipping on that lean
Tripping on that bean
Lighting up the blunt
Now I'm getting drunk
Sipping on that lean I feel so high
Tripping on that beat now I feel so wild
Lighting up the blunt I feel so high
All I wanna do is getting blind
Sipping on that lean now I feel so high
Tripping on that beat now I feel so wild
Lighting up the blunt I feel so high
All I wanna do is getting blind
I feel so high, I feel so fine, I feel so high
I got money, don't you worry, don't be shy
Don't tell mommy, she will cry, I know you love me, ain't gonna lie
Everyday no sleeping, I am restless, yes
Don't sit down, make noise, just in progress, yes
Deep at night, super quiet, I'm undressed, yes
Everyday no sleeping, I am undressed, yes
Sippin' on that lean, I feel so high
Tripping on that beat now I feel so wild
Lighting up the blunt I feel so high
All I wanna do is get implied
Sipping on that lean I feel so high
Tripping on that beat now I feel so wild
Lighting up the blunt I feel so high
All I wanna do is get implied
