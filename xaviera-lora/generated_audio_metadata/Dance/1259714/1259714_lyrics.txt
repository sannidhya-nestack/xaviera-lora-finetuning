Island of beginning, of eternity
The end of time and space
What dances with light and shadows
But never loses place
I'm the force that binds, the stars that finds
What caresses planets soft
The universal time
In the cosmic rhyme
Finding my tribe
Let's cut that into stellar light
The universal time
In the cosmic rhyme
Finding my tribe
Let's cut that into stellar light
What is all the waste
Right in front of you
But can never quite be seen
What can travel around the universe while staying in a corner
The roots nobody sees are taller than the trees
Up up it goes yet never grows so take it as you please
Universal time in the cosmic rhyme
Finding my tribe let's cut back into stellar five
In universal time
In the cosmic rhyme
Finding my tribe
Let's cut that into stellar vines
What fills a room but takes no space?
What can you catch but never throw?
I'm in the sky and in the ground
When you live I fly
I sing when you die
I drift forever with the current
And flow to places unknown
Every planet a brand new mystery
All the races I have known
Universal time, in the cosmic rhyme
Finding my tribe, let's cut back into stellar vibe
In universal time, in the cosmic rhyme
Finding my tribe, let's cut back into stellar vibe
Or it's seen in stars and places unknown
Every planet, a brand new mystery
All the races, I have known
Universal time, in the cosmic realm
Finding my tribe, let's go back into Stellavine
In universal time, in the cosmic realm
Finding my tribe, let's go back into Stellavine
What is seen in the stars and heard in the stillness
And felt in the heartbeat of every creature
What binds us together yet sets us apart
An eternal enigma, born in each heart
I'm in my tribe, let's got that interstellified
Finding my tribe, let's got that interstellified
A whisper in winds, a secret in streams
A silent companion in all of our dreams
It's the song of the cosmos, a universe in tune
Played in the light of an ever changing moon
It's the spark of creation, the dancer of time
In every age, almost blind
Unseen yet felt, a paradox so true
The interstellar link between me and you
Universal time
In the cosmic prime
Finding my tribe
That's got that interstellar vibe
Universal time
In the cosmic prime
Finding my tribe
That's got that interstellar vibe
