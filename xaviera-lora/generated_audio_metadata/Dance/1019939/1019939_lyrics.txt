Oh, I know, oh, I know
This ain't my battle, baby
I'm facing what has faced me
I walk the waters now, not sinking, I won't drown
I'm doing what I believe, I know where I will be
I see it all before me
I let my future call me
I walk through all this now, I'm sinking, I won't drown
I'll do what I believe, I'll know what I believe
I felt, I'm finally free
The sky is feeling thin, cause failure gave me wings
I'm gonna get to you
You're the one that's gonna come through
Oh I know, oh I know
This ain't my battle baby
I'm facing what has faced me
I walk the waters down not sinking I won't drown
Under what I believe I know what I believe
I see it all before me
I let the future call me
I walk the waters down not sinking I won't drown
Under what I believe I know what I believe
I know what I believe
I know what I believe
I know what I believe
Oh I know
This ain't my battle baby
I'm facing what has faced me
I walk the waters now, I'm sinking I won't drown
Under what I believe, I know what I believe
I know what I believe, I know what I believe
If I know what I believe, oh I know, oh I know
