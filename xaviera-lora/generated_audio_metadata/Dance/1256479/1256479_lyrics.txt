Sail in the ocean, music in motion, waves of sound tonight
Beats are calling, stars are falling, feel the rhythm and light
Into the night, I, deep as the light, I
Sail away, feel the sway, party till the day
Bassline pumping, heartbeat thumping
Lost in a sea of groove
Lights are flashing, energy is clashing
Nothing but way to move
Into the night
I keep house the light
I sail away, feel the gusts wave
Party till the day
Into the night, I
Deep past the light, I
Sail away, feel the sway
Party'til the day
Bassline poppin', heartbeat thumpin'
Lost in a sea of groove
Lights are flashing, energy's clashing
Darling don't wait to move into the night, I
Deep house the light, I
Sail away, feel the sway, party till the day
