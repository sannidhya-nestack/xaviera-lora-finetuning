Some single bad times
Mother nature isn't it too much
Living lonely in a modern world, oh yeah
Days are rolling on into night
Shaking up chemicals of light
Little matter of a broken mind, yeah
'Cause you know, you know, you know, you know
That you're gonna love her forever, baby
You know, you know, you know, you know
That your imminent destiny is just the way it's meant to be
You know, you know, you know, you know
That you're gonna love her forever, baby
You know, you know, you know, you know
That your imminent destiny is just the way it's meant to be
This just the way it's meant to be
All the stars need the dark to shine
Maybe you can move it all in time
I need a world with love and all this light
you know, you know, you know, you know
That you're gonna love me forever, baby
You know, you know, you know, you know that your
Evening destiny is just the way it's meant to be
You know, you know, you know, you know that you're gonna love me forever baby
You know, you know, you know, you Know that your evening destiny is just the way it's meant to be
It's just the way it's meant to be (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's just the way it's meant to be
You know, you know, you know
You'll love her forever
You know, you know, you know
You'll love her forever
you know, you know, you know, you know
That you're gonna love her forever, baby
You know, you know, you know, you know that your
Imminent destiny is just the way it's meant to be
You know, you know, you know, you know that you're gonna love forever baby
You know, you know, you know, you that your
Imminent destiny is just the way it's meant to be
It's taken away, it's made to be (It's taken away, it's made to be)
