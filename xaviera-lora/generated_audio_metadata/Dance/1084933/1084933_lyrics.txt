Is this the end? I don't wanna let you
Leave me here just to pretend
You're someone I met who just walked in and got a drink
You've been on my mind I think can't let you go right now
Not tonight I'm looking down
Stuck and I've been figuring how
I just wanna dance, I just wanna dance, I just wanna dance
I just wanna dance, I just wanna dance, I just wanna dance
The feeling in my bones, yeah, I can wanna dance
I'm caught up in my head now and I just wanna dance
I just wanna dance, I just wanna dance ,I just wanna dance
I just wanna dance, I just wanna dance, I just wanna dance
Make me feel like you used to
Make me feel like you used to
Make me feel like you used to
Make me feel like you used to
Make me feel like you used to
Make me feel like you used to
I just wanna dance, I just wanna dance, I just wanna dance
I just wanna dance, I just wanna dance ,I just wanna dance
I just wanna dance, I just wanna dance, I just wanna dance
I just wanna dance, I just wanna dance ,I just wanna dance
