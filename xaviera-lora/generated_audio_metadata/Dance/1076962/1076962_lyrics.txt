I make him beg, dance till the moon meet the sunset
Whenever he wake, he get the, the pancakes
Come on baby, come on baby, you know where I'm at
I can give you anything and you know that's a fact
Don't be afraid to give your heart away
Silent your phone, it's just you and me alone
All the rooftops, the reviews and the deep talks
Come on baby, come on baby, tonight is a dream
It don't even matter as long as you with me
No te preocupes, esta noche it's just us
You give me like everything, I give them that's what's on ya ya ya
You give me like everything, I give them that's what's on ya ya ya
Yo puedo darte el mundo, eres mio yo soy tuyo
He give me like everything, I give him that to-to-to-to
I make him mad, I confuse him, make him stressed
But I make him laugh, I know what buttons to press
I know baby and a baby will hide the one cold
But when I back it up and do it, it's when I'm told
You seem okay,'cause I can make everything go away
When he needs love, I don't put no on a belt
And if he falls down, I'ma pull my baby up
You don't gotta, you don't gotta worry on me
I can be your rock and you can be my king
No te preocupes, esta noche is just a
You give me like everything
