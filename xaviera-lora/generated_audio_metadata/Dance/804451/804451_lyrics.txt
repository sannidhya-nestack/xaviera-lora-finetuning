What's killing me?
What's killing me?
You're so tactical, impractical
But I just can't stop, that's factual
You're pleasable, teasable, so unbelievable
Can't you just be reasonable?
Yeah, pull me in just like a drug
You get me high, then pull the plug
Can't get out, the hole I dug
Tell me when's enough enough
Everything I love is killing me
You're hot and sick, that makes me weak
And drives me to insanity
Everything I love is killing me (what's killing me?)
I can't say no, I can't let go, you're messing with my energy
You're lovable, you're hateable, you're just so inescapable
You're picking me, shaking me, blasting, forsaking me, play the doll, so sexual
So reel me in, on your line
I take the bait, every time
Hooked again, I know that I'm
Going where I can't rewind
Everything I love is killing me (it's killing me)
The hide and seek that makes me weak and drives me to insanity
Everything I love is killing me (it's killing)
I can't say no, I can't let go, you're messing with my energy
You look deep inside me, unhypnotized
You get me, you make me so paralyzed
You get me high, high
Just get me high, high
And you'll know why
Everything I love is killing me (yeah, pull me in just like a drug)
Taking me, shaking me, blessing, forsaking me
Everything I love is killing me (yeah, it's killing me)
The hide and seek that makes me weak and drives me to insanity
Everything I love is killing me (it's killing me)
I can't say no, I can't let go
You're messing with my energy
Everything I love is killing me (it's killing)
Your hide and seek that makes me weak and drives me to insanity
Everything I love is killing me (it's killing you)
I can't say no, I can't let go
You're messing with my energy
