Give me, give me, give me just a taste of your lemonade
Taste of your lemonade
Hit the lights, make'em bright, burn up the floor tonight
Live it up, live it up, adrenaline speed in the club
My appetite's flying blind, I'm drinking vodka and lime
Fill my cup, fill my cup, I'm fancy on a Friday night
Now I could die, can't you look that fly
You're teasing me
You make a grown man cry
Now I won't lie
You're the bomb all right
Keep on grinding me
And lose yourself tonight
Would you give me just a taste of your lemonade
Oh oh baby
It's so hot it hurts but I can feel no pain
Just a taste of your lemonade
Oh oh baby
Your lipstick traces make me radiate
The sweetest soda
Cherry cola
You're my favorite flavor
Your lemonade is like a sick first aid
Just the taste of your lemonade
Oh oh baby
I'm sure out on your lemonade
Run the band
Wear the shin
Wear the ballroom blitz
Shakin' it (shakin' it)
Songs are bad by bad
It's like a spell I can tell
Lost in heaven or hell
Freakin' me (freakin' me)
Out on your epic heels
I could die'cause you're making me high
Just by squeezing me
Feels like a house on fire
Now I won't lie
You're playing from car ride
I can't keep fighting it
Gonna lose myself tonight
Won't you give me just a taste of your lemonade
Oh oh baby
It's so hard it hurts but I feel no pain
Just a taste of your lemonade
Oh oh baby
Your lipstick traces make me radiate
The sweetest soda, cherry cola, you're my favorite flavor
Your lemonade is like a sick first aid
Just the taste of your lemonade, oh oh baby
I'm straight out on your lemonade
You're burning and burning me can't cool down
And I'm screaming out loud
You're turning and turning and making me bounce
Girl you got me strung out (strung out) of your lemonade
Just a taste of your lemonade
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Just the taste of your lemonade)
Oh, oh, baby (Oh, oh, yeah)
It's so hot it hurts but I feel no pain
Just the taste of your lemonade (She's a delaminator)
Oh, oh, baby (Oh, oh, oh)
Your lipstick traces make me radiate
You're sweet and so are your toes (Oh, oh, yeah)
So I got my favorite flavor
Your lemonade is like a sick first aid
Just the taste of your lemonade (The lemonade is like a six-foot)
I'm strung out on your lemonade (lemonade)
Taste of your lemonade (oh baby)
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh (taste of your lemonade)
Sweet soda, oh oh oh oh
