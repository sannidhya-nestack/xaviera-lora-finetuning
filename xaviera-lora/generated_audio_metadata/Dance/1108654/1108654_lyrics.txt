Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm, I should realize I'm blind
That I got to read between the lines
That a day may come too soon
When everything I knew should be done
You were right, I could be wrong
I tried to sing your favorite song
Come on babe, don't leave me here
We could be real in another tear
Baby, you're my bright light
And you know I'll make you money
Put a pistol to my head
Wish I was dead, I'm just not your kinda girl
Put a pistol to my head, pistol to my head
You wish I was dead, I'm just not your kinda girl
Put a pistol to my head, pistol to my head
True love is a deed of the past
Nothing left, nothing new to last
Everything I thought was right
Is going on some hard tonight
Going on some hard tonight
Your soft touch and your sweet kiss
Whispering words in all this bliss
Swimming in your eyes of blue tonight
Come on baby, you know it's right
Baby, you're my bright light (you're my bright light)
And you know I'll make you money (make you money)
Put a pistol to my head
You wish I was dead, I'm just not your kind of girl
Put a pistol to my head, pistol to my head
You wish I was dead, I'm just not your kind of girl
Put a pistol to my head, pistol to my head
Baby, you're my friend like
You wish I was dead
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You were right, I could be wrong
I tried to sing your favorite song
Come on babe, don't leave me here
We could be real in all the tears
Baby, you're my bright light
And you know I'll make you money
Put a pistol to my head
You wish I was dead, I'm just not your kinda girl
Put a pistol to my head, pistol to my head
You wish I was dead, I'm just not your kinda girl
Put a pistol to my head, pistol to my head
