Messages on the windshield
Words to make us feel
Nighttime echoes around
City lights and a boring sound
Love notes on the white birds
Heartbeats stacked by wires
Grooving to the street vibe
Dancing to the beat we ride
Messages on the glass
In the moment that all we had
Opened me like the wind
This night is where love begins
Raps and smiles and glances
In the funk our romance dances
Engines hum in the night
We shine in the street light
Tires roll, the beat goes on
Love lets a crack of dawn
Feel the pulse on the windshield
In this night we are unfilled
Let's reduce all the glass
In the moment we're all we have
Cruising in life and when
This night is where love begins
Eyes for the people's own
Love like it's a crack of dawn
Feel the pulse on the windshield
In this night we are unseen
Message is all of us
In the moment it all we have
Proving you like the wind
This night is where love begins
