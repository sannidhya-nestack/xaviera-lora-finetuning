Every day and every night you are running through my mind
Got me feeling oh so light can't escape it even if I try
Can't stop thinking about you
You're the sunshine breaking through
I can't stop thinking about you
In my dreams and when they do
When I'm walking down the street, every face is so repeat
Got your love on endless beat, never felt supposed to cease
When I'm walking down the street, every face is gonna be
Got your love on endless beat, never felt something so sweet
Can't stop thinking about you
You're the sunshine breaking through
I can't stop thinking about you
In my dreams and when they do
