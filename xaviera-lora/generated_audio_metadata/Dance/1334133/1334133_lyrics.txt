I'm a bad ass, I'm a bad ass, I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad ass
You walk in and the room takes shape
Every word's got a perfect weight
But I've heard charm before
Don't need polished anymore
If it's real I don't need a show
Let it hit me soft or bold
I'm not chasing smoke again
So start where the truth begins
Don't need a script don't need a line
I just want what's really mine
Say it like you mean it
Don't hold back, give it to me straight
I can handle that, if it's love let it land
Don't leave me guessing, every word you feel
Like a confession, I don't need perfect
Just give me real
Say it like you mean it
Let me feel
We both danced around the edge
Said enough but never said
I'm not here for halfway hearts
If we start then let's start
Pull me closer not away
Mean the things you choose to say
I don't need a sugar high
Give me so give me why
If it's worth it, take the leap
Say it loud, don't let it be
Say it like you mean it
Don't hold back
Give it to me straight, I can handle that
If it's love, let it land
Don't leave me guessing
Every word should feel like a confession
I don't need perfect
Just give me real, yeah
Say it like you mean it, let me feel it
Every second counts for something
Don't waste mine pretending
You don't have to know the ending
Just speak like you're defending
Say it like you mean it
Don't hold back
Give it to me straight
I can handle that
If it's love let it land
Don't leave me guessing
Every word should feel
Like a confession
I don't need perfect
Just give me real, oh
Say it like you mean it, let me feel
