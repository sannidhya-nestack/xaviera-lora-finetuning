Midnight whispers start to play
Neon lights lead the way
Hearts are racing feel the beat
In the night it sounds so sweet
Dancing shadows cross the floor
Open hearts, they want more
Stars above, tails held so close
Every touch, every kiss
Glorious tales in the night
Good night days, feeling right
Love unfolds in the glow
Never end, don't let go
Let it close up, I'm about to hide
Ooh, there's sparks in the sky
Midnight air feels so for free
Just one look, you and me
Glorious tales in the night
Midnight days feeling right
Love unfolds in the glow
Never end, don't let go
Glorious tales in the night
Moonlit sparks in low-eye
In the dance, story told
In the night, love in gold
(Led the, led the)
(Led the, led the)
Yeah, baby, look at those
Get those out all night to hide
Moonlit sparks in the sky
Midnight air feels so for free
Just one look, you and me
In this hour, hearts collide
Warriors tails, we won't hide
Every dance a story told in the night
Love in gold
Dope and gold
D-d-d-dope and gold
D-d-d-dope and gold
D-d-d-dope and gold
Loop and go, loop and go
Loop and go
In this hour, how's your life?
Are we sales or on high?
Every dance a story told
In the night, are we cold?
In this hour, our laughter high
Moonlit sparks in the sky
Midnight air feels so fool free
Just one look, you and me
