My baby says she's really getting so old
Been left in the cold
Every time she says it I say hey, oh no
And help you grow
I was made for loving you, I know that is true
So now that I say this to you
Do you love, do you love me too?
Do you love, do you love me too?
You know I'm true
I don't need to tell you that I love you so
And I don't need to say these words
But I love you all the time, baby
I love you all the time, baby, I love you
I don't need to tell you that I love you so
And I don't need to say these words
I love you all the time, baby
I love you all the time, baby, I love you
I hope that bad thoughts roll away in your life
I'll help you find the love
Do you need, do you need me too
I was made for loving you
I know that it's true
So now that I say this to you
Do you love, do you love me too
Do you love, do you love me too? (Yeah, yeah)
You know I'm true
I don't need to tell you that I love you so
And I don't need to say these words
I love you all the time baby
I love you all the time, baby, I love you
I don't need to tell you that I love you so
And I don't need to say these words
I love you all the time, baby, I love you all the time, baby, I love you
Thank God times won't fade, baby
Love you all the time, baby
I love you, I love you all the time
Oh, I love you all the time
I love you all the time, baby
Oh, yeah, yeah
Love you all the time, baby
I love you
I love you all the time, I love you all the time, yeah, I love you
