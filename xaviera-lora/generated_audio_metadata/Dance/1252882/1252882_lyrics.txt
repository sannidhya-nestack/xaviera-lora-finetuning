Taking clouds and shifting tides
In the balance where we ride
Edge of reason, point of no return
In the friction we discern
Every moment tensions rise
Lines are drawn and we're the prize
In the heat we find desire
Dumb through the wire
Hearts on fire
Down to the wire, stakes are high
In this game, we learn to fly
Every breath is sharper, it's higher
Down to the wire, we aspire
Fractured echoes time collides
In the chaos youth resides
Breaking free from all we've known
In the struggle we have grown
Every moment tensions rise
Lines are drawn and bear the prize
In the heat we find desire
Dumped through the wire
Hearts on fire
Down to the wire, stakes are high
In this game, we learn to fly
Every breath is sharp but tired
Down to the wire, we aspire
In the silence hear the hum
Of the battles yet to come
In the shadows find the spark
Down through the wire we embark
Down through the wire stakes are high
In this game we learn to fly
Every breath is sharper, tired
Down through the wire we aspire
Final seconds sharp and clear
In this moment we revere
Down to the wire face our fear
With this fire we endure
