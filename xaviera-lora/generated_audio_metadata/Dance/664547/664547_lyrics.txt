I've been up
I've been up
I've been up
I've been up, I've been down late around the summer
I've been up
I've been up
I've been up
I've been up
I've been up, I've been down, been around this town now
I've been up, I've been down, been around this town now
I've been up, I've been down, being around this town now
I've been up, I've been down, been around this town now
I got a big big house in my kitchen
I got twenty three bullets in my brain
I found the world now I'm wishing
I hear ten more pennies to my name
Talk to what's my condition
There's nothing left in your head
Priest I have a confession
I want a page 3 in my pen, my pen, my pen
Look I know you wanna follow
But believe I've been around
Seen the faces, different cases
Embraced them up in my town
There's no point in playing catch up
No match up to me I'm gone
Look I bullied my way in this game
This ain't even my song
No you're wrong
Yes I'm down for the cold babe
But I ain't Chris
You want rap?
Nah you don't say
But okay listen to this
All the bullets in my brain left me lost
But today I'm found
If you didn't hear before
Then I hope you're hearing me now
Got too many fans, yeah, Henna club, pop too many shams (Got too many fans, yeah, Henna club, pop too many shams)
Got too many fans, yeah, Henna club pop too many shams
Got too many fans, yeah, Henna Club got too many shows
Wednesday, Thursday, too many plans down by 2B, got too many fans
I've been up, I've been down, been around this town now
I've been up, I've been down, been around this town now
I've been up, I've been down, been around this town now
I've been up, I've been down, been around this town now
I got a big big house in my kitchen
I got twenty three bullets in my brain
I found the well now I'm wishing
I had ten more pennies to my name
Doctor, what's my condition?
There's nothing left in your head
Priest, I have a confession
I want a page three mother in my bed
I've been up, I've been down, been around this town now
I've been up, I've been down, been around this town now
I've been up, I've been down, been around this town now
I've been up, I've been down, been around this town now
I've been up
I've been down
I've been up, I've been down
I've been up, I've been down
I've been up, I've been down
I need my Nintendo, I need my Nintendo, Nintendo
I've been up, I've been down, been around, but still done (x2)
