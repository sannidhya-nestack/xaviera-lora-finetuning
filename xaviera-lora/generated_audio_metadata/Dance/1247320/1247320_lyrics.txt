In the dark where dreams sway
Every step a mystery
Fade away set me free
Fade away like the night
With your glow shining bright
Through the ancient trees where the secrets hide
Feyre's laughter echoes far and wide
In the heart of nature where the spirits dwell
Feyre's enchantment casts a spell
Feyre shows the way
In the dark of dreams way
Every step a mystery
Feyre set me free
Feyre light the night
With your glow shining bright
Stars above are twinkling in the midnight sky
Feyre's magic lifts me as I fly
In the realm of wonders where the wishes lay
Feyre leads me to a brighter day
Feyrey show the way
In the dark where dreams sway
Every step a mystery
Feyrey set me free
Feyrey light the night
With your glow shining bright
As the dawn is breaking
Whispers start to fade
Feyre's light lingers in the memories made
In the quiet morning as the new day starts
Feyre's magic stays within our hearts
Fairy, show the way
In the dark we dream this way
Every step a mystery
Fairy, set me free
Fairy, light the night
With your glow shining bright
Fairy, guide my flight
Through the realms of the night
