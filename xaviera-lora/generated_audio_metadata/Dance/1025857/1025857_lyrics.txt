Sorry, I was too emotional, that's what you said
All blue when you told me I was just a measure, you
Oh, but you don't know what you don't know when you only see black and white
What's gonna love you so when you're a moon over the color blind
Well, I won't turn it off, no, no, no, turn it off
I won't go nothing, no
I won't turn it off, no, no, no, see them all
The colors of the spectrum
Palette, palette, palette
Palette of the spectrum
Palette, palette, palette
Palette of the spectrum
Yellow, scared that I will leave you
So you let me go
Earth and green
When you're dark to dark, oh, don't know what to feel
Oh, but you don't know what you don't know when you only see black and white
What's gonna happen when you're a rainbow over the color blind?
Well, I won't turn it off, no, no, no, turn it off
I won't go numb for no one
I won't turn it off, no, no, no
Cinema
The covers of the spectrum
Palette, palette
Palette of the spectrum
Palette, palette
'Cause it's all the same to me
Lovin' me is the sunset of the sea
Baby, too bad you can't see none of it
You can't see none of it
Lovin' me is the brightest I gotta see
But it's too fast that you don't see none of it
You don't see none of it
Well, I won't turn it off, no, no, no
Turn it off
I won't go nothing, no
I won't turn it off, no, no, no
See'em all
The colors of the spectrum
Palette, palette
Palette of the spectrum
Palette, palette
'Cause those are the stripes, yeah
