You don't have to say anything
Your ways told me
All those words don't count for nothing
That's one word you said, sing what you say
You don't have to say anything
Your ways told me
Your lips keep moving and talk talk talk
But there's one thing you said
A single word said
A single word said
You don't have to say anything
'Cause your waist told me
Your lips keep moving and ta-ta-ta
But there's one thing you said, I said you're upset
Mister, do you really think you can fool me?
The way you move, the way you walk, it all tells me
That you ain't doing right to me
You ain't doing right to me
You can't fool me
Do you really think I'm a fool for you
And die when you're gone
Let me tell you something
I won't, I won't, I won't, ooh
I just wanna tell you what I'm going through
I want you to look me in my eyes
Say that I would do the same thing that you do to me
Would you still love me?
Say I would get a phone call and walk to the other room
And I'd lower my voice and when you call me and you hear me say
I love you too
Would you still love me?
I don't wanna shout at you but I'm so mad
How could you think you could walk around with your lady so bad?
No more shit from you
Now get your gun back to set
Go to your room
Get your stuff on
Get gone and dance the ball
