On and on with you can show it
On and on with you can show it to me
I never got the time to get you down
I never got the time to get you down
So tell me how long you will send me away
So tell me how long you will send me away
Take it from you and send it your way
Only know it, you can show it
Only know it, you can show it to me
I've never got the time to get you down
I've never got the time to get you down
I need you to tell me I know you won't send me away
I need you to tell me I know you won't send me away
I need to tell me I love you or send me away
