Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Glitter on my skin, neon in my veins
Dancing all night long, no time for chains
They say I'm too loud, too proud, too bright
But honey, that's just how I shine my light
I'm a firework, ready to explode
A supernova on the dance floor
Can't dim my spark, can't tame the flame
Get ready'cause I'm'bout to change the game
I'm electric, eclectic, magnetic, can't resist it
So let it flow, I'm fantastic, bombastic
Elastic, watch me glow, glow, glow
You can't stop this hurricane
For some nature break the chains
I'm electric, watch me light up the sky
Tonight I'm gonna fly, fly, fly
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Can't try to clip my wings but I soar higher
Haters stand my flames just fuel my fire
I'm a tiger hear me roar
Got the world knockin' at my door
I'm a shooting star across the night
A disco ball of pure delight
Can't hold me back can't slow me down
I'm here to claim my rifle crown
I'm electric, eclectic, magnetic, can't resist it
So let it flow, I'm fantastic, bombastic, elastic
Watch me glow, glow, glow
You can't stop this hurricane
I'll force out nature, break the chains
I'm electric, watch me light up the sky
Tonight I'm gonna fly, fly, fly
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
They can try to put out my light
But I'll just shine twice as bright
I'm a supernova, can't you see?
This is who I'm meant to be
I'm electric, eclectic, magnetic, can't resist it
So let it flow, I'm fantastic, bombastic, elastic
Watch me glow, glow, glow
You can't stop this hurricane
Force of nature break the chains
I'm electric
Watch me light up the sky
Tonight I'm gonna fly, fly, fly
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
