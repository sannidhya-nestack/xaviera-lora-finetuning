And what about all of the love
And what about the things that we said
And what about the places we've been
And all of us
And all of us
Tonight it's us against them
Tonight we will win
Oh, oh, we win-win
Oh, oh, we win-win
Oh, oh, we win-win
Oh, oh, we win-win
And what about all of the love
And what about the things that we said
And what about the places we've been
And all of us
And what about all of the love
And what about the things that we said
And what about the places we've been
And all of us
And all of us
