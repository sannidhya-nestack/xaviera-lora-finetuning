Stay tonight, stay with me tonight
You better believe when I say you should stay for the night
Cause I'm not afraid of letting you know
Yeah you know it's on my mind
Hey baby I'll show you the time of your life
Don't be shy
Come follow me into a night of desire
Be like fire, you and I
Wanna hold you (tonight)
Gonna show you (tonight)
You're my getaway
Stay with me tonight
Stay with me all night
Stay with me tonight, I'm very fantasy, baby
Stay with me tonight, tonight, tonight
You better believe when I say you should stay for the night
But I'm not afraid of letting you go
Yeah you know when we're satisfied
So take it or leave it but only today
Is all I can say
So make up your mind before I'm walking away
Away from the night of play
Wanna touch you (tonight)
Gonna use you (alright)
For the night if you stay, baby
Gonna take you (tonight)
Wanna quake you (oh)
You're my getaway
Stay with me tonight
Stay with me all night
Stay with me, tonight I'm all you're gonna need, baby
Stay with me, tonight, tonight, tonight
You wanna hold you, gonna show you, you're my getaway
Stay with me tonight (oh baby stay, oh yeah)
Stay with me all night (oh you should stay all night)
Stay with me tonight, it's all we're gonna need (baby, baby)
Stay with me tonight

Tonight I'm every fantasy (baby) baby stay (stay) with me (with me)
Tonight (tonight) tonight (tonight) tonight
