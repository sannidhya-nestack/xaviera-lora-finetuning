I can barely sleep'cause you were always on my mind
I can hardly breathe, I'm so afraid to lose the time
We were so big, we were lovers
We were superstars undercover
We shared so many things together
Thought our love would last forever
Don't leave me, no don't leave me, don't leave me
Your love kept my heart on fire (kept my heart on fire)
It burned with desire (it burned with desire)
But our world is falling down (falling down)
Falling down without you (without you)
You kept my heart on fire (you kept my heart on fire)
It burned with desire (it burned with desire)
Our world is falling down (falling down)
Falling down
Tell me where is the man who really cares what I feel
Tell me where is the faith that removes all my fears
Can you turn back the time to relieve my pain
I wish that you could deny
What you all have done in your life
Don't leave me, no don't leave me
Don't leave me, no don't leave me
Don't leave me
Your love kept my heart on fire
It burned with desire
And my world is falling down
Falling down without you
You kept my heart on fire (you kept my heart on fire)
It burns with desire (it burns with desire)
Now it is falling down (now it is falling down)
Falling in love, falling in love without you
Falling in love without you
You kept my heart on fire (kept my heart on fire)
It burned with desire (it burned with desire)
My world is falling down (falling down)
Falling down without you
You kept my heart on fire (you kept my heart on fire)
It burns with desire (it burns with desire)
My world is falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down without you
Falling down without you
