All night, all night long, night long, long, long
I'm running out of my thirst for you
I need to break from this taboo
It's holding me down, I don't want you around
My heart is hot and my feet won't touch the ground
I'm moving on from the things you do
I got a new love and it's not you
I need to break free
To a higher degree
I'm daring you to come and have a go with me
All night long
The music's got me high tonight
Under the ultraviolet light
I can't explain it
All night long
The music's got me high tonight
Under the ultraviolet light
I can't explain it
Whoa, all night long
And now I'm free from the things you do
I won't sit still and wait for you
The time is just right, I'll be out of sight
My feet are moving and I won't be turning to you
Music sounds good with or without you
It's a certified method, tried and true
Please don't bring me down
I'm the talk of the town
I'm warming up so let's spin this record around
All night long
The music's got me high tonight
Under the ultraviolet light
I can't explain it
All night long
The music's got me high tonight
Under the ultraviolet light
I can't explain it
Oh, all night long, all night long, all night long
All night long, the music's got me high tonight (got me high tonight)
Under the ultraviolet light (ultraviolet light)
I can't explain it, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
All night long, the music's got me high tonight (got me high tonight)
Under the ultraviolet light
I can't explain it
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
All night long
The music's got me high tonight
Under the ultraviolet light
I can't explain it
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
All night long
The music's got me high tonight
Under the ultraviolet light
I can't explain it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Glow, glow, glow
