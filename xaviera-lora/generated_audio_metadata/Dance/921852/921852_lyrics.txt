Day I look up to the blue
Laying next to me
I only think of you
And what I do
Follow me
And what I do
Follow me
And what I do
Follow me
Hold me close to you
I'll hold me close to me
Come on baby
Share the world with you
Hold me close to you, I'll pull me close to me
Hold me close to you, I'll pull me close to me
Hold me close to you, I'll pull me close to me
Hold me close to you
Under covers that stretch the skies
You're with me I can always fly
Feel my heart beat so fast
Come share with me my pillow
Let's make this last
(Follow me, I wanna know)
(Follow me, I wanna know)
(Follow me)
Pull me close to you, I'll pull me close to me
Come on baby, show me what you want
Pull me close to you, I'll pull me close to me
Pull me close to you, or pull me close to me
(Oh, baby, yeah, baby)
Pull me close to you, or pull me close to me
Only cause to you are only girls, Sammy
Only cause to you are only girls, Sammy
Only cause to you are only girls, Sammy
Only cause, only cause, only cause
Only cause, only cause, only cause
