I will stand fast in love through the storm above
Heart is strong enough for the both of us
When the nights are long hold tight stay strong
Our love is the song we'll sing all night long
Stand fast in love we rise above
No fear no doubt love's what it's about
Sunshine sky so clear
No more tears to fear
With you always near
Love will persevere
Through the highs and lows
Love forever shows
We'll take it slow
In this life we grow
Stand fast in love
We rise above
No fear, no doubt
Love's what it's about
When nights are long, hold tight, stay strong
Our love is the song we'll sing all night long
Stand fast in love, we rise above
No fear, no doubt, love's what it's about
