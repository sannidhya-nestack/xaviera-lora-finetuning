You had me wrapped around your finger from the first day
And I know that we were meant to be so don't you walk away
I won't let you go until you've given me, given me
Hundred percent, that's what I want
Hundred percent, less is not enough
Hundred percent, that's what I need
Hundred percent, just give your love to me
Just give your love to me
I want it all
I won't settle for anything else now
I let my feelings show
And there is no turning back, no when or how
I won't let you go until you give me
Hundred percent, that's what I want
Hundred percent, less is not enough
Hundred percent, that's what I need
Hundred percent, just give your love to me
I have been missing you since yesterday
Now I want to kiss you again and again
Again and again
Hundred percent
That's what I want
Hundred percent
Less is not enough
Hundred percent
That's what I need
Hundred percent
Just give it up to me
Hundred percent
That's what I want
Hundred percent
Less is not enough
Hundred percent (that's why I got you)
(Hundred percent)
Just give you love you love you love you love you love you love
Hundred percent (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Hundred percent (percent)
