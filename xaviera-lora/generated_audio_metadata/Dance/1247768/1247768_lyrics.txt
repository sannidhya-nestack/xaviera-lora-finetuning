Neon lights paint this concrete jungle
Baselines throb with an urban jungle rumble
Flambo rumble
Calling all creatures to link their cages
This primal playground knows no ages
Skid buck wild, let your hair shake
Break free from rules that society makes
We're that blazing bonfire of truth tonight
Burning all insecurities with rebel heartlight
Melodies chant like ancient tribal cries
Igniting our spirits to reach new heights
We sway and stomp with unhindered soul
One liberated tribe with no control
So get buck wild, let your hair shake
Break free from rules that society makes
We're that blazing bonfire of truth tonight
Burning all insecurities with rebel heartlight
In this oasis of unbound expression
We shed all facades, embrace transgression
Reborn as bare beings of raw animation
This uncaged freak scene is our true nation
So get buck wild, let your hair shake
Break free from rules that society makes
We're that blazing bonfire of truth tonight
Burning all insecurities with rebel heartlight
As the concrete dawn breaks the primal spell
Battle scars remind just how hardly we're built
A permanent blaze in our fertile souls
Of the night we dance free of our reaching truth
As the concrete dawn breaks the primal spell
Battle scars remind just how hard we rebelled
A permanent blaze in our feral souls
Of the night we dance free of all rigid controls
As the concrete dawn breaks the primal spell
Battle scars remind us how hard we rebelled
A permanent blaze in our feral souls
Of the night we dance free of all rigid controls
As the concrete dawn breaks the primal spell
Battle scars remind us how hard we rebelled
A permanent blaze in our feral souls
Of the night we dance free of all rigid controls
