Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
My mouth starts lifting at the corners, tongue's a wild ride
You're waiting joy up on my face, and letters ten feet wide
I'll jump with electricity when your hand touches mine
A living breathing sculpture of the way I feel inside
You're air be my emotions, I'm buzzy like a neon sign
You got me smiling
Lips curl up keep rising
Blowing like the sun in the morning sky
There's no denying
Deep flesh bright as lightning
Beaming like a torch in the black of night
Girl you got me smiling
Oh oh oh
You know you got me smiling
Oh oh oh
Bones are radiating, shake my body into life
Your kisses drop like falling bombs exploding in my mind
Lungs fill up with laughter'til my eyes begin to stream
Your happiness bumps through my veins in waves of ecstasy
This party's getting started, I'm bubbling like a smoke machine
You got me smiling
Lips curl up keep rising
Blowing like the sun in the morning sky
There's no denying
Deep black Friday's lightning
Beaming like a torch in the black of night
Girl you got me smiling oh oh oh
You know you got me smiling oh oh oh
I'm not so delirious with positivity
Feels so incredible the change you've made to me
Got me smiling, lips curl up keep rising
Blowing like the sun in the morning sky
It's no denying
Deep flash brightest lightning
Beaming like a torch in the black of night
You got me smiling
Lips curl up keep rising
Blowing like the sun in the morning sky
There's no denying, teeth clutched bright as lightning
Beaming like a torch in the black of night
Girl you got me smiling, oh oh oh
You know you got me smiling, oh oh oh
Got me smiling, lips curl up keep rising
Keep rising, glowing like the sun in the morning sky
This morning now you got me smiling (you got me smiling)
Black Friday's lighting
Beaming like a torch in the black night sky (like a torch in the black night sky)
Girl you got me smiling, oh oh oh
You know you got me smiling, oh oh oh
