The sun is shining all day long
Feet and scent feel so wrong
But with you we can't go wrong
Feel the rhythm, let's belong
Dance, dance on the sand
Take my hand, take my hand
Under the sun, oh so grand
Let's dance, let's make a stand
Waves are crashing to the beat
In the heat find our retreat
On this beach it's you and me
Moving freely can't you see?
Waves are crashing to the beat
In the heat, find our retreat
On this beach, it's you and me
Moving freely, can't you see?
Footprints fading in the tide
Side by side, hearts open wide
In this moment, nothing to hide
Together we collide
The moonlight guides our way
In your arms I want to stay
As the music softly plays
Forever and a day
Dance, dance through the night
Feel the rhythm, hold me tight
The stars above shine bright
With you everything's light
Dance, dance on the sand
Take my hand, take my hand
Under the sun, oh so grand
Let's dance, let's make a stand
