Mmm, I want you bad
Mmm, I want you bad
Mmm, I want you bad
Mmm, I want you bad
It's growing so fast
Your lips, this dance, hold on
The sun in our backs
Our fate in the sand
I want you bad
I want you bad
Mmm, I want you bad
Mmm, I want you bad
And I want you better
I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm fine, too bad (I-I-I-I-I -I-I-I-I'm fine, too bad) (I'm fine, too bad) (I-I-I-I-I-I'm fine, too bad) (I-I-I-I-I -I-I-I-I'm fine)
And when I want you bad (I-I-I'm fine)
Too bad (I-I-I'm fine)
I-I-I'm fine
Too bad (I'm fine)
Too bad (I-I-I'm fine)
Too bad (I-I-I'm fine)
I-I-I'm fine
Waiting patiently
Sleeping in love for me
Mmm, I want you bad
Mmm, I want you bad
Mmm, I want you bad
Mmm, I want you bad
It's growing so fast
Your lips see the distance, hold on
The sun in our backs
Our fate in the sand
Mmm, I want you bad
Mmm, I want you bad
Mmm, I want you bad
Mmm, I want you bad
And I want you bad (I-I-I-I-I)
Too bad (I-I-I-I -I)
I-I-I-I-I
Too bad (I-I-I-I)
Too bad (I-I-I-I I)
Too bad (I-I-I-I, I)
I-I-I-I -I
And I want you bad (I-I -I -I)
Too bad (I-I-I-I-I-I -I-I-I-I-I-I)
Too bad (I-I-I-I)
Too bad (I-I-I-I-)
Too bad (I-I-I-I I-)
I-I-I-I-I (Mm, I want you bad)
Mm, I want you bad
Mmm, I want you bad
Mmm, I want you bad
