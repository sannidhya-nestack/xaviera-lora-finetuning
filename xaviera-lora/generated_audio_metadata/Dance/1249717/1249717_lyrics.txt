I've been dying for you, I've been dying for you, I've been dying for you
Dreamer on the rise (ah-ah) heart like neon lights (ah-ah)
Feel the rhythm in your soul, baby, take me to the night (ah-ah)
Warrior in the dance (ah-ah) shining through the fight (ah-ah)
This is where we both belong, baby, let's ignite the light
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, yeah!
Dreamer on the rise, heart like neon lights
Feel the rhythm in your soul, baby take me to the night
Warrior in the dance (so clear)
Shining through the fight (oh oh)
This is where we both belong
Baby let's ignite the light
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, yeah, oh, ooh, ooh, yeah, oh
We're soaring high above the city lights
Embrace the freedom, lose ourselves in the heights
Through every heartbeat, the pulse electric flows
In this moment our love forever glows
