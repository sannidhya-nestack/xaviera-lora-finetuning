Hola, ¿cómo está, mamita?
Yo, what's your name?
You ain't from around here.
Hey let me ask you something you ever been to Miami
You and I Miami rendezvous
You and I Miami rendezvous
You and I
Girl you're just too eous to be walking around with a frown
Beauty queen with a crown
Supermodel swag attires rockstar down
Haven't seen your face around
So you gotta be from out of town
Give me the privilege I just wanna show you how Miami gets down
For us tonight, here together,'til the morning light
Walk along the shore standing high
Out on the moonlight, never in the same
Come with me and I'll take you there
Love and music is in the air
An oasis of sun and fun
Forever like lovers, we'll be as one
You and I, Miami Ronde 2
You and I, Miami Ronde 2
You and I, Miami Ronde 2 (Tu y yo, tu eres mi chula)
You and I, Miami Ronde 2 (Tu and yo, tu eres mi chula)
You and I
No hay ninguna duda, mami tu eres muy chula
Es la primera vez que te conocí, you stuck to my metula
Llámame el maestro mulata, cause I'm a school ya
And just for the looks you got an A + extra credit, come sooner
Just a party, meet me at South Beach
Life's exciting, all with M .O. reads
Famous mad life and sparkling wine
Everybody's always feeling fine
Come with me and I'll take you there
Love and music is in the air
Feel alive, you feel the mood
Miami, Miami, rendezvous
You and I, Miami rendezvous
You and I, Miami rendezvous
You and I, Miami rendezvous (tu y yo)
Eres un chula (you and I)
Tu y yo (Miami rendezvous)
Eres un chula (you and I)
Come on mamita, take my hand, come walk with me
Ay mamacita you teasing me
When I went through the process to keep you around
Now you say that you leaving me
You deceiving me
But I'ma be alright
Just promise me you won't et tonight
When you come back baby I'ma get you right, alright
You'll be back some day
And I believe that day will be around spring break
Nobody's waiting for us tonight
Here together'til the morning light
Walking on the shores hand in hand
Out on the moonlight never in the same
Come with me and I'll take you there
Love and music is in the air
Feeling like you feel the mood
Miami, Miami rendezvous
You and I, Miami rendezvous
