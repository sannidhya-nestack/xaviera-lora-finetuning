I never let you go, let you go, let you go
You got me feeling like I'm crazy for you
A hunger so misunderstood, stood, stood, stood
I tried to fight it but I can't ignore you
crazy never felt so good, good, good
When I'm with you it's like a throwback
What can I do so we can go back?
Bitch we're naked'cause we got low jack
I miss that little smile
I've run in circles since the rollback
Put in the work to get the show back
Let's go and get a glass of Malbec and I'll get at you
I never should've let you go
Let's get a little retro, retro
It's better just to let you know
I'm feigning for the retro, retro
I never should've let you go
Let's get a little retro, retro
It's better just to let you know
I'm feigning for the retro, retro
My mind just blown, my head is aching for you
I know it's only getting worse, worse, worse
I wait and wish and watch the world adore you
But they don't know I had you first, first, first
I never stood to let you go
Let's get a little retro, retro
It's better just to let you know
I'm feigning for the retro
I never should've let you go
Let's get a little retro
It's better just to let you know
I'm feigning for the retro
I miss you, miss you, PM Dawn
I miss you, miss you, Technotronic
I miss you, miss you, Flare and Soul
I miss you, I miss you
I'm fading for the retro (I miss you) I'm fading for the retro (It's better just to let you know) I'm fading for the retro (I miss you, I miss you)
(The retro, the retro, the retro)
I never stood to let you go
Let's get a little retro, retro
It's better just to let you know
I'm faded for the retro, retro
I never should've let you go
Let's get a little retro
It's better just to let you know
I'm fading for the retro
