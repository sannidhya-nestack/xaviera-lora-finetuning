Good, I guess I never thought you would
Oh, I wish that I had understood
Darling, we could never be so good
Darling, won't you let me in
If you let me close so I can love you better
And there's nothing wrong with giving in
We could be much better if we got together again
I guess I never thought you would
Oh I wish that I had understood
Darling we could never be so good
Darling I've been suffering
Thought that we had something but I still got nothing and I'm slowing down chasing it
But my heart beats faster when you call my number
Good
I guess I never thought you would
Oh I wish that I had understood
Darling we could never be so good
I guess I never thought you would
Oh I wish that I had understood
Darling we could never be so good
We could never be so good
Good
I guess I never thought too much
Oh, I wish that I had understood
Thought that we could never be so good
Good
I guess I never thought you would
Oh, I wish that I had understood
Darling, we could never be so good
