We're all dreamers in our own way
Tryna find our own way home through the galaxies
We're on a mission to release
We've had our way done now
Might not ever be coming back
I see a shooting light
I think it means we'll be alright
Be alright
Be alright
We're all dreamers in our own way
Tryna find our own way home through the galaxies
We're on a mission to release
We've got a weather map
I could never be coming back
I see a shooting light
I think it means we'll be alright
Be alright
Be alright
Be alright
I think it may well be alright
