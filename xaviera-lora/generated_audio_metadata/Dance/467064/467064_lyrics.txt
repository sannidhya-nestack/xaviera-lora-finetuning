I the name is (name is) (name is) (name is) (name is)
Name is (name is) (name is) (name is) (name is) (name is)
Anonymy, down on the ground, doing what they doing
Acting crazy, feeling for each other, things are really moving
Ooze and Oz are flying around, that's the sound of heaven
I get a grip'cause I know it's really coming
I try to keep my head on
They're having a ball all by themselves
They're having a special moment
It's just for them and nobody else (Nobody else)
Nobody else (Nobody else)
Shame me, shame me, shame me, shame me, shame me (x10)
I don't know the name of, name of, name of, name of, name of, name of, name of, name of, name of, name of, name of, name of, name of, name of, name of, name of, name of, name of, name of
And an Amy down on the ground
Doing what they doing
Acting crazy feeling for each other
Things are really moving
Ooze and Oz are flying around
That's the sound of heaven
I get a grip'cause I know it's really coming
I try to keep my head on
They're having a ball all by themselves
They're having a special moment
It's just for them and nobody else (Nobody else)
Nobody else (Nobody else)
