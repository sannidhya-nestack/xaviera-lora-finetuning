You've got me saying words in my head
Filling my mind with these images, yeah
And it's the way that you look at me
Makes me feel like I can't breathe
It ain't right, right, right
It ain't right, right, right
It ain't right, oh no
It ain't right, right, right
It ain't right, right, right
It ain't right when you're coming back around
You've got me all in my feelings
Like I could die without you next to me
It's the way that you look at me
Makes me feel like I can't breathe
It ain't right, right, right, it ain't right, right, right, ain't right, oh no
It ain't right, right, right, it ain't right, right, right, it ain't right
When you're coming back around
You're calling my phone
I'm being patient but I'm all alone
Staying faithful and I'll never know
When you're coming back around
When you're coming back around
When you're coming back around
When you're coming back around
