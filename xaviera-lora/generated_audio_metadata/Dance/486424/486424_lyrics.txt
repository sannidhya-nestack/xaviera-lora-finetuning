The moon is shining spotlight from above
Stars are dancing in the sky
It's party time I'll never get enough
And I can't wait to start tonight
So come with me and I'll show you the way it's the weekend
I'm ready to play
We're making love
On the dance floor
As the DJ hits my spot
We're making love
On the dance floor
And it makes my body rock
Go up and down
Around and around
In and out
Make it scream and shout
I'm making love
On the dance floor
music gives you more
Late in the evening wondering what to do
You want something that's right for you
Well in this place you'll get just what you need
So come on in, do what you please
Just feel the beat, let it spin you around
On the dance floor, don't you wanna get down
We're making love on the dance floor
As the DJ hits my spine
We're making love on the dance floor
And it makes my body rock
Go up and down, around and around
In and out, make you scream and shout
I'll make you love on the dance floor
music gives you more
Move, DJ, spin me around, up
And down, don't let me touch the ground
Hot from the rock, play with the sound
On the dance floor, I want more
So go DJ, people on the floor
Everywhere, music gives you more
Go up and down, listen to the sound
On the dance floor, I need more
We're making love
On the dance floor
As the DJ hits my spot
We're making love
On the dance floor
And it makes my body rock
We go up and down
Around and around
In and out, but make you scream and shout
I'll make you love on the dance floor
music gives you more
Make you love on the dance floor
Music gives you more
