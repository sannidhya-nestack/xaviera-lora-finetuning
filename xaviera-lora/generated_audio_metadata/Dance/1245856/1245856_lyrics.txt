Sure applied, hypnotized, the urban night
Electric pulse awakens our primal might
The baseline throbs with a seismic cry
We can't resist, our being's compliant
I, we can't resist, our being's compliant
Ride the wave, let the rhythm flow
Parties move forever as the beat goes
Melodies soar through a sonic swell
Merging our souls in a euphoric spell
We dance as one, transcendent tribal reign
Let the groove unleash pleasure's fate
Ride the wave, let the rhythm flow
Body smooth, forever the beat goes
So space to run but can't extinguish the fire
Night celestial universe forever burnt in a fire
An eternal dance of fashion's residue
So quake awake and give your existence a new
Let's all break away in our existence anew
