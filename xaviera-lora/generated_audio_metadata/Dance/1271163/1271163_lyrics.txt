I walk in with the confidence
Head held high got that face real nice
I'm a queen yeah
Love my life nothing bands can buy
Give a feeling like this
Cause I never miss
In a world full of noise I'll make a perfect melody
Leave a legacy to remember me as the one with the good life
I got it all here to run with it
Cause I got everything I wanted
I got it all here to run with it
Cause I got everything I wanted
Hey, got it all here, I'm riding with it
I got everything I wanted
Hey, got it all here, I'm riding with it
I got everything I wanted
I got it
I got it
I got it
But I'm my own boss and I'm in control
You count in your loss'cause I'm making gold
Diamonds on rings, diamonds I own
The finer things are better alone
I got game but I'm not playing with you
No shade, got better things to do
I'm locked in a rhythm of life
Comfortable sleeping at night
Ain't in love but I get the two
In a world full of noise I'll make a perfect melody
Leave a legacy to remember me as the one with the good life
He got it all in a moment
Cause I got everything I wanted
He got it all in a moment
Cause I got everything I wanted
I got it all here already
Cause I got everything I wanted
I got it all here already
Cause I got everything I wanted
Got it
