Baby, you're bad in the best of ways
Oh, I gotta say, yeah, I think you're great
Oh, look at that, what a mess we made
Oh, I gotta say, yeah, I think you're great
I've had too much to think
I need another drink
Kiss me, we're on the brink
Baby, you and me, we can take this whole town
We can burn it all down, just stay with me
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna hold back
Baby, you should know that you're all I need
Take this whole place down
Take this whole place down
Baby this feels so right, tonight could be our night
Take this whole place down
Make your mind up, in the end you gon' be alright
Take your time though, don't rush into something you'll regret, live your life
To the fullest, anything you feel like doing, I'm with it
Pour a little liquor, gin and juice, free spirit
Tie up a couple loose ends, before we get it, how we get it ain't a secret
Smoking brewed banner on the beaches, then it's off to the club, late night features
Saint, to end off a late night adventure
Off into the sunrise just like a western
Tonight was the best yet, we ain't slept yet
We just wanna go on and on'til we get lit
We can burn it all down, just stay with me
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna hold back
Baby you should know that you're all I need
Take this whole place down
Take this whole place down
We gon' take it on down (Baby, this feels so right)
(Tonight could be our night) our night (Take this whole place down)
Take this whole place down (Baby, this feels so right)
(Tonight could be our night) our night
This feel so right, tonight is our night and we ain't stopping until the sunrise (Baby, this feels so right)
(Tonight could be our night) our night
Burn it all down we worked all night now it's time to hit town just stay with me
Baby you and me
We can take this whole town we can burn it all down just stay with me
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna hold back baby you should know that you're all I need
Baby you and me, we can take this whole town
We can burn it all down, just stay with me
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna hold back
Baby you should know that you're on the lead
Take this whole day down, take this whole day down
Take this whole place down (We gon' take it on down)
Baby, it's just alright, tonight we'll be all night (all night)
Take this whole place down (Take it on down, take it on down)
Baby, you and me, you and me (We can take this whole town)
We can burn it all down, just stay with me
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna hold back
Baby, you should know that you're all I need
Take this whole place down
