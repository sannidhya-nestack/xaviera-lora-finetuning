I made a mistake last night
Maybe I can make it right
Slide on closer baby
We can talk about it
No need to be mad
Hate to see you sad
Yes, I know I'm crazy
Crazy'bout you, crazy'bout your love
I know I'm a flirt sometimes
I know I get drunk some nights
I know I get way too high
I just wanna live it up with you
I know that it might be tough
I know when you've had enough
It's just how I show my love
Darling, can I live it up with you?
