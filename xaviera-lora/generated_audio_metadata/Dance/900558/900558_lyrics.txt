All the things you try to tell me
Don't really make no sense at all
When you say you'll always love me
But I don't feel it when you won't even call
I can't feel this baby
Where's this love that
Oh you say you have for me
Whoa
I can't touch it baby
Seems like nothing ever really comes for free
I can see your heart, your words
Keep pouring down all over me, woah
All this fighting, boy, we're high on
Won't you please just come on down with me
I can see your heart, your words
Keep pouring down all over me, woah
All this fighting, boy, we're high on
Won't you please just come on down with me
All the ways you tried to hide it
No apologies will work with me
Instead I'm sitting here crying
Wondering why I ever wasted my time
I can't feel this baby
Where's this love that all you say you have for me
Oh, I can't touch it baby
Seems like nothing ever really comes for free
I can see your heart, your words
Keep pouring down all over me, woah
All this fighting, boy, we're high on
Won't you please just come on down with me
I can see your heart, your words
Keep pouring down all over me, woah
All this fighting, boy, we're high on
Won't you please just come on down with me
All the ways you tried to hide it
No apologies will work with me
Instead I'm sitting here crying
Wondering why I ever wasted my time
I can't feel this baby
Where's this love that all you say you have for me
Oh, I can't touch it baby
Seems like nothing ever really comes for free
I can't see your heart, your words keep pouring down all over me, woah
All this fighting, boy, we're high on
Won't you please just come on down with me?
I can't see your heart, your words keep pouring down all over me, woah
All this fighting, boy, we're high on
Won't you please just come on down with me?
