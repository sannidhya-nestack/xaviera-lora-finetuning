My mama used to tell me to always take a stand
Never praise or thank God and don't depend on no man, yeah
Not your father or your brother, they'll treat you like a tool
Then you'll be a lame child and baby that ain't cool
Don't listen to the losers
Don't listen to the fools
Don't listen to the haters
If you do, that ain't cool
My friends used to say, "Babe, you better trap a man before you get too old"
Hey, I say that ain't a plan, I'm gonna fight my battles each and every day
Then I remember what Mama used to say
Don't listen to the losers
Don't listen to the fools
Don't listen to the haters
If you do, that ain't cool
Don't listen to the losers
Don't listen to the fools
Don't listen to the haters
If you do, that ain't cool
Don't listen to the losers
Don't listen to the fools
Don't listen to the haters
If you do, that ain't cool
Don't listen to the losers
Don't listen to the fools
Don't listen to the haters
If you do, that ain't cool
