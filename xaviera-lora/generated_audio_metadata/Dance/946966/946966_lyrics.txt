I know you've been feeling me, baby
Won't you give it up?
And we both know that this could be something
But that ain't enough
when the leaves start falling down
I need to see you be around
I gotta know that you'll be there
You gotta show me that you care
I gotta know that you'll be there
Just give me the duty, yeah, oh
You gotta show me that you care, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know you've been feeling me baby
Won't you give it up
And we both know that this could be something
But that ain't enough
when the leaves start falling down
I need to see you be around
I gotta know that you'll be there
Scooby-dooby-dee yeah
You gotta show me that you care
Can't, can't, can't, can't be there, can't be there
I gotta know that you'll be there
It's coming to do the yeah, oh
You gotta show me that you care, care, care, care
Way bigger, way bigger
