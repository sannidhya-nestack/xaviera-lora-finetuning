Saturday night, black look right, for goin' up with invites
You got my squad, feelin' right, tonight we'll make memories we've never had
No need to wait, let's celebrate
Our time is now, so let's show'em how
We're setting the world on fire, rising higher and higher
Our moment's here, it's clear, we're gonna own this year
So dance until sunrise, we're reaching for the skies
These feet soft, dry, we'll ride the wave of our lives, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Speakers loud, moving crowd, energies up, we're feeling proud
No regrets, raise the stakes, this is our time to make our breaks
The world's off stage, we're all the rage
So let it out and sing it loud
We're setting the world on fire
Rising higher and higher
Our moment's here, it's clear
We're gonna own this year (here, here)
So dance until sunrise
We're reaching for the skies
This beat's our guide, we'll ride
The wave of our lives
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
We're young, we're bold, our stories untold
The night is ours, we've got superpowers to make it last
No looking back, so let's go crazy and make history
We're setting the world on fire
Rising higher and higher
Our moment's here, it's clear
We're gonna own this year
So dance until sunrise
We're reaching for the sky
The sky is our guide
We'll ride like the wave of our lives
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We're young, we're bold, our stories untold, the night is ours
We've got superpowers to make it last, no looking back
So let's go crazy and make history
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
