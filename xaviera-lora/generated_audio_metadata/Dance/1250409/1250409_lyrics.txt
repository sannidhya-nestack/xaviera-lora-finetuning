Everybody's looking sharp tonight
See a thousand bright lights in my sight
Test was calling, let's take flight
Oh, we're feeling it right
Laughter, echoes, drinks and help
Friends around, it's a one night band
Grandma glitters when we stand
She glows, let's make our own brand
Laughter echoes, drinks in hand
Friends around, it's a one night band
Grandma glitters when we stand
She glows, let's make our own brand
She glows, can you hear me breathe
Heartbeat sinking perfectly
Shake love under disco lights
Hold on tight through the night
Step by step just you and me
Let'em flow like the ocean sea
Shake love that's our melody
Feel the rush set your spirit free
Moments flash like a Polaroid
Joy so pure never get annoyed
In this space we can't avoid
All the world's noise, shake love deployed
Shake love, in the air we breathe
Heartbeat sick in perfect weave
Shake love, I'm against all lights
Hold on tight
Through the night
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Bomb and splash like a Polaroid
Try something new and everything unknown
In this space we can't afford
All the world's machine I've deployed
Shake it off, give me how we breathe (give me how we breathe)
Heartbeat's sinking, nothing we've found is second to none
Shake it off, under the starlight
Hold on tight through the night (hold on tight through the night)
