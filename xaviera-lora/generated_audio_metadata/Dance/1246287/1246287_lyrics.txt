Every beat drops, floor shakes
A new night awakens, a new story to share
Neon Colors, scope colors blur
Rhythmic pulse, heart stir
In ambitions they let loose
Be free this sanctuary
Our reverence our key
The music builds, the energy grows
We surrender to the dynamo
Break free, break the chains
Lose yourself in the refrain
This electric dream
Our FM on the stream
Walk your brains to freeze
Bass rumbles to breeze
Rumbles, melodies soar
One tribe united forevermore
Escape the daily crime
This rest that divine
We shine, entwine, align
The future must sound, our souls are bound
In this moment, we're the now
Break free, break the chains
Lose yourself in love with brains
This electric dream
Our fair moments stream while you reign supreme
The world fades away, only what matters
Rhythmic heartbeats, sonic splatters
Transcend state, the upper feathers
In this realm, they truly exist
Break free, break the chains
Lose yourself in the refrain
This electric train
All of them on the stream
While we race afraid
The night may break
But the fire remains
A fleeting flame
But the spark sustains
We'll return
Break free, break the chains
Lose yourself in the refrain
This electric train
Heart of them of a string
Will be raised so free
In nightly rain but fire remains
A fleeting flame but this heart sustains
Will return
