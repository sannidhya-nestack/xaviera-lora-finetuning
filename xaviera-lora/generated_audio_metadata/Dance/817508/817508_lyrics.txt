I might talk to this girl at the bar
But she's acting hard and she's acting raw
Step side to side, slide back, round and round
Bartenders love me that's why I get drinks for free
That, that, that, that, that
That, that, that, that, that
I might talk to this girl at the ball
But she's acting hard and she's acting raw
Step side to side, slide back, round and round
Bartenders love me, that's why I get drinks for free
