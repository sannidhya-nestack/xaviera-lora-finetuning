Take me up, take me up, take me up, take me up (DJ)
I've been working hard a whole week straight
There's one thing on my mind (one thing on my mind)
All work, no play, you know what they say
I'm ready to unwind (to unwind)
The DJ has a way, he knows just what to play
To chase the blues away
I'm into that booming bass as the floor vibrates (woo)
So into the (woo) so into the (woo) so into the party
So DJ, take me up high
Straight up to the ceiling
It's heaven to me
And I'm loving this feeling
Take me up high
Up to the ceiling
It's heaven to me
And I'm loving this feeling
Well I'm loving, loving, loving, loving this feeling
Yes I'm loving, loving, loving, loving this feeling
I'm loving, loving, loving
Love in this feeling, I'm loving, loving, loving, loving this feeling
The place is packed, everybody's up
And we ain't comin' down, we ain't comin' down
We won't have enough'til the sun comes up
And the DJ works us out, works us out, works us out
Now he has a way, he knows just what to play
To chase my blues away
Get into that booming bass
As the blues operates
So into the flow, so into the flow, so into the party
So DJ, take me up high
Straight up to the ceiling
It's heaven to me
And I'm loving this feeling
Take me up high
I hope to see you there
It's happened to me
I'm loving this feeling
Well I'm loving, loving, loving, loving this feeling
I'm loving, loving, loving, loving this feeling
I'm loving, loving, loving, loving this feeling
I'm loving, loving, loving, loving this feeling
So DJ, take me up high, straight up to the ceiling
It's heaven to me, and I'm loving this feeling
Take me up high, up to the ceiling
It's heaven to me,'cause I'm loving this feeling
Take me up high
Take me up DJ
Take me up high
Take me up DJ
Take me up high
Take me up DJ
Take me up high
Take me up DJ
