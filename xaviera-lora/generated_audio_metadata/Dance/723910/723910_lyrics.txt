Money, money, money, money, money, money, money
Shopping down on the road
Buying all in high dose
That is how the day goes
My ego rises
Ready for the action
Hunting your attraction
In spite of the reaction
A game with prices
I'm the girl that hated, money compensated
I was terminated and lost in crisis
Looking in the mirror, now I see it clearer
Believing was an error, no more disguises now
I'm drowning alone, so
Never going back, such a money-making act
Drew the least I could and never stopped
Green and gold forevermore, money all my friends
I was dollar, they were cents
They got tired of my show and they would fall like a game of dominoes
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Fall like a domino
Going for the flavor
Living like a player
Diamonds are forever
Addiction rises
Every little penny
Took me on a journey
Bought you all the money
No more disguises now
Though I'm drowning alone
I'm never going back
Such a money maniac
Drew the least I could in every store
Green and gold forevermore
Money all my friends
I was dollar they were cents
Ain't got time
On my show and they would fall like a game of dominoes
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Fall like a domino
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Fall like a domino
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money
Money maniac I am dying to come back
To my basic ordinary store
Buying more and more and more
Money for my friends that are dying all I send
They get tired of my show and they will follow
Like a game of dominoes
But I'm drowning alone, so
Never going back
Such a money-making actress
Drew the V's and cuttin' every stone
Green and gold forevermore
Stupid to pretend
I was molding all my friends
They got tired of my show
And they were falling like a game of dominoes
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never going back, searching money made me act
Drew the V's, I caught in every store
Green and gold forevermore, money all my friends
I was down and they were sins, they got tired of my show
And they were falling like a game of dominoes
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Fall like a domino
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Fall like a domino
