I, I'm living life on my own
Why, oh why
When it's everywhere that I go
So what now
I figure out what you say
But my, oh my
Every time I try
I get numb inside again
And every time it's the same
Oh my god did I die?
I can feel my body's trying hard to breathe
When it's leaning in over me
I'm feeling like a teen again
I never felt so alive
But I see him turn and walk the other way
And spinning inside of me, why
I didn't try to make him stay
Oh my god did I die
I
I'm trying hard to get by
My oh my
And I lie awake in the night
But why oh why
And I see your face everywhere
So what now
Don't know what to do
To get over you, I pray
But you're here again, everyday
Oh my god did I die?
I can feel my body's trying hard to breathe
When it's leaning over me I
I suffocate and make believe
I can't break out of this lie
I see him turn and walk the other way
And spinning inside of me why
I couldn't make him stay
Oh my god did I die
Did I die
Every time I try
I feel warm inside, again
Don't know what to do
How to get over you, let it break
Every night and day
Oh, beat it down
I can feel the fire's turning back to me
When you're spinning it over me I
I'm feeling like a teen again
I never felt so alive
But it's the internal work the other way
And it's burning inside of me why
I didn't try to make you stay
Oh my god did I die
Every time I try (my body's turning hard to breathe)
I can't love inside again
Don't know what to do
How to get over you
How to break
Every night and day
Inside of me why
Why it didn't stay
Oh my god did I die
