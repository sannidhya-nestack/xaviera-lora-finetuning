The things we do for love
The things we do for love (yeah)
She's living in a movie, she has always doubted
But the things we do for love
All the painted faces and the race for attention
But the things we do for love
Maybe you could make it if you seen through all the fakers
But the things we do for love
You better believe that you receive as you perceive it
But the things we do for love
We do what we do
What we do only for love
We do what we don't want to do
Only for love
It's only, it's only for love
It's only, it's only for love
It's only, it's only for love
It's only, it's only for love
Looking at myself and all the roads I could have taken
But the things we do for love
All the painted faces and the race for attention
But the things we do for love
It takes you and it breaks you when the time is through
But the things we do for love
Things are broken down everyday I cry
But the things we do for love
We do what we do
What we do only for love
We do what we don't want to do
Only for love
It's only for love
It's only for love
It's only for love
It's only for love
It's only for love
It's only for love
It's only for love
It's only for love
It's only for love (It's only)
It's only for love (It's only for love)
It's only for love (It's only for love)
It's only for love (Oh, baby)
We do what we do
What we do only for love
It's only
We do what we don't want to do
Only for love
It's only
We do what we do
What we do only for love
We do what we don't want to do
Only for love
