Just let go and give up the fight
Save your words and all your weapons
Cause I've heard it all before
You can try but you're never gonna break me down
No you're never gonna shake my ground
Cause I've already been through the fire
You can't only take me higher
No, you're never gonna break me down
No, you're never gonna shake my ground
I've already been through the fire
You can't only take me higher
Got some new friends, new perspective
And now I'm standing strong
No, I don't care what you're thinking
But it's nice to prove you
I will give everything that I've got
It just might shoot me straight to the top
Save your words and all your weapons
Cause I've heard it all before
You can try but you're never gonna break me down
No you're never gonna shake my ground
Cause I've already been through the fire
You can only take me higher
No, you're never gonna break me down
No, you're never gonna shake my ground
I've already been through the fire
You can only take me higher
I can tell you're not done, you've got more to say
Go ahead, throw whatever you want my way
Doesn't work anymore'cause I found freedom
I will fight, I will win, I will overcome
No, you're never gonna
No, no, you're never gonna
You can only take me higher
You can try but you're never gonna break me down
No, you're never gonna shake my ground
I've already been through the fire
You can only take me higher
No, you're never gonna break me down (break me down)
No, you're never gonna shake my ground
I've already been through the fire
You can't only take me higher (take me higher)
