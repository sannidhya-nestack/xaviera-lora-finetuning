Empty promises and broken dreams
We were golden once, so it seemed
Now we're standing here with nothing left to prove
In the wreckage of our bankrupt love
Well, our whisper's in the night of what used to be
Fading echoes of our lost melody
In the ruins of a paradise gone cold
Our bankrupt love with stories left untold
Bankrupt love with stories left untold
Bankrupt love, we gave it all away
In the shadows of the night and the light of day
Once we had it all now there's nothing to say
Bankrupt love, just a debt we couldn't pay
Lovers' fortunes lost in the game we play
Silver linings, burnt shades of grey
Hearts invested in a dream that couldn't last
Now we're haunted by the ghosts of our past
Now you broke love and gave it all away
In the shadows of the night and the light of day
Once we had it all now there's nothing to say
Let it grow, no, just a debt we couldn't pay
In the empty rooms where laughter died
Echoes linger where the tears were cried
In the silence now we both understand
Pancroped love slipping through our hands
Whispers in the night of what used to be
Fading echoes of our lost melody
In the ruins of a paradise gone cold
A bankrupt love with stories left untold
Bankrupt love, we gave it all away
In the shadows of the night and the light of day
Once we had it all now there's nothing to say
Bankrupt love, just the debt we couldn't pay
Want to kiss at the glass of the faded stars
In the mirror, mirror where our memories lie
At night we'll look out the distant sky
In the book of lost we say goodbye
