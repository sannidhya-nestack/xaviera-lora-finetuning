If you know, like I know, cuidado, cuidado
New York, Chicago, D .C., Key Largo
Boston to Kingston, London, the Kingdom
Everywhere, all the time, all the time
On the grind, truth hurts but they better do work
80 grand in the hand for my brand new verse
New Jag, super shift, super new bag
Is the body on the girl, superb
It's my way, the fly way
Roof off, new Porsche on the highway
From Akla to Mumbai
From sundown to sunrise
If you know, like I know, cuidado, cuidado
New York, Chicago, D .C., Kilago
Boston, to Kingston, London, the Kingdom
Everywhere, all the time, all the time, on the ground
Crews up, everybody move up and they looking at the number on my brand new Benz
Too much, we hit a few clubs and I leave with a couple of my brand new friends
No sleeping, no siesta, the weekend don't remember
It's our life, it's our time and your love is all mine
If you know, like I know, cuidado, cuidado
New York, Chicago, DC, Kilago
Boston, to Kingston, London, the Kingdom
Everywhere, all the time, all the time, all the grind
If you know, like I know, cuidado, cuidado
New York, Chicago, DC, Kilago
Boston, to Kingston, London, the Kingdom
Everywhere, all the time, all the time, all the grand
Cuidado, Cuidado, Maoklik, Desperados, New York, Chicago, DC, Kilago, Boston, to Kingston, London, the Kingdom, we everywhere, everywhere, all the time, all the time, all the time, all the time, on the grind
