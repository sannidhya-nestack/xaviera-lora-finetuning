Excuse me is this table 16? Yes it is. Can I see your card please? Sure, here you go. Ah, good evening Mr. Sweet. You're the big blind, good luck! Woo! Okay dealers, shuffle up and deal!
So there's this fish sitting at my table
Gotta hope it ain't me
There's a croc to my left with a bib in his chest
Licking his chops at me
You slow played the flop
I got a flush draw on the turn
You set the trap on the river
How that table turned, haha
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)
Got your back up against the wall
You better think before you make that call (Yeah, I'm all in, I'm all in now, I'm all in now)
You thought you had me fooled (Yeah, I'm all in)
Now look who just got schooled (Woo, yeah)
You took a chance in the river
Thinking that you can swim
You had a cut on your toe
You didn't know
And here comes my dorsal fin
There's chum floating in the water
Better hang your flag half mass
You thought you were smooth
I was playing you
And it's gonna cost you your ass
Without luck I'd be the best around
No one could compare
You act real tough, I know it's a buff
Your shades can't hide your stare
You're bullied around the table
And you push the few jumps out
You're talking trash, you ain't gonna last
Your luck just ran out
Sucker
I'm only, I'm only man
Man you ain't got a clue
I'm only, who the hell is teaching you
I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, look who just got schooled (I'm all in, I'm all in, I-I-I-I'm all in, I-I-I -I'm all in, I'm all in, yeah, I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in, look who just got schooled (I'm all in, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-) He thought poker was all luck (Yeah, I'm all in), postcards like that and the mark (Yeah, I'm all in), he thought you had me fooled (Yeah, I'm all in), he thought you had me fooled (Yeah, I'm all in), he
Yeah, and I guess you just got schooled (I'm on in now, I'm on in now, I'm on in now)
Final table, dealers, shuffle up and deal (Come on)
I caught a satellite to the top (to the top now)
Sitting here with Dolly Parton
Gotta see that fly for the rules I've just otten
I ain't got the nuts, I'm playing this hand on tilt
My life's on the line with the one of a kind
To risk this stack I built
You gotta be kidding me (I'm only, I'm only, I'm only, I'm only)
He just called me bluffing (I'm only, I'm only, I'm only)
Sitting here holding nothing (I'm only, I'm only, I'm only, I'm only)
I never felt so low (cause I'm all in)
Don't you dare tell me that you told me so (I'm all in)
(I'm all in now)
I gotta gamble in new places (I'm all in)
Saratoga and my lucky suitcases (I'm all in, I'm all in)
I tried my luck on football or horse races (I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in)
Man, I recognize all these faces
I'm back in town, I ain't messin' around
I got a bankroll and an attitude
You're feeling good and it's understood
My big stack's gonna change your mood (I'm all in, I'm all in)
Sitting pretty, such a pity
You're gonna have to face it
There's no doubt, you'll soon find out
It's my time to win that bracelet
Blind man's bluff, those days were tough
Wow, Billy and cool hand Luke
There's Gilligan and Mary Ann
The professor and Annie Duke
A cheering section, what he win an election?
Or is she Aussie banging in my head?
I lost my gold tooth to Phil helm youth
et the steak, I'll have a shake instead
Gus's ears are ringing
The motor mouth keeps singing
And poison Ivy said he's heard enough
That Johnny Chan's no Jackie
That Texas Doyle's no slacky
Cause at the table they're both hot stuff
Lost my lease to some guy Reece Foss
Old man dig up Ming the master
Sky the wings yeah baby Jah is Daniel crazy
Save me Jesus from this disaster
