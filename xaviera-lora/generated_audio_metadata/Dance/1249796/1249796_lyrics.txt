Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I wanna be with you
Be with you
When I wake up in the morning light
I see you shining oh so bright
They just don't know what you're like, no
When they're waiting and they're shouting down on you
I know exactly what they're trying to do
I just want to tell them
I don't wanna play these games no more
I just want you to know
The way I'm saying how you make me feel
my feelings just not real
I don't wanna be with you
I don't wanna see it through
I don't wanna
I don't wanna be with you anymore now in my life
Don't wanna be with you
I don't wanna see it through
I don't wanna see it through
I don't wanna be with you anymore now in my life
When I'm looking deep into your eyes
I get the feeling I don't like
And you told me it's not right, no
The way you make me feel inside
Don't wanna be with you tonight (tonight)
And I just don't wanna fight no more
I just want to tell them
The reason I'm not staying here no more
I just want you to know that I ain't playing any of your games no more
'Cause I don't wanna be with you (with you)
I don't wanna see it through (see it through)
I don't wanna be with you anymore now in my life
Don't wanna be with you (with you)
I don't wanna see it through (see it through)
I don't wanna
I don't wanna be with you anymore now in my life
Be with you
See it through
Be with you
