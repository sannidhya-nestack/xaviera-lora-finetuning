Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woke up feeling something new
In my chest there's a song
Beat aloud I think it's you
See your face in my dreams
Now you're real, it's unreal
In your eyes I see the gleam
Zip into my heart
Take my hand, let's start
Feel the beat, we're one
Underneath the sun
Every word you say, ooh
Melt my fears away, away
In your touch I wanna stay, ooh
Can't deny this spark
Girl, you're my shining star
We don't need no fancy car
Swim into my heart (into my heart)
Take my hand and start (start)
Feel the people warm underneath the sun
Underneath the sun (ooh)
Underneath the sun (ooh)
Every word you say melts my fears away
In your touch I wanna stay
Can't deny this spark girl you're my shining star
We don't need no fancy car (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tap into my heart (tap into my heart)
Take my hand, it's gone (my hand, it's gone)
Feel good being the one
Underneath the sun (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Underneath the sun (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Can't deny the spark
Girl, you're my shining star
We don't need no fancy car
Ooh, take my hand to my heart
Take my hand to my heart
Take my hand, let's start a show
Feel the beat of my heart
Underneath the sun
Underneath the sun
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I believe that's all it holds
Can't deny the spark
Girl, you're my shining star
We don't need no fancy car
Ooh, ooh, ooh
