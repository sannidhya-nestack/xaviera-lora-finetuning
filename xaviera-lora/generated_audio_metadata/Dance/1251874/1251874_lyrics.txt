Glitter in the lights
Heartbeat on the floor
I get magic in my stride baby
Open up the door
Stars up in the night
Shining through my soul
This will turn into a ride baby
We are in control
Queens up in the night
Crowns about to shine
Feel the rhythm take a hold
Baby step into the light
Sparkles on the dance
Glowing through the time
Let the energy unfold baby
We were born to shine
Euphoria in the air
Beats a line with stars
Feels like wonder everywhere, baby
That's just who we are
Magic in our sway
Echoes of our sound
Make the moments last today, baby
Lift us off the ground
Queen's up in the night, crown's about to shine
Feel the rhythm, take a hold baby, step into the line
Sparkles on the dance, glowing through the time
Let the energy unfold baby, we were born to shine
Queen's up in the night, crown's about to shine
Feel the rhythm take the hold, baby, step into the light
Sparkles on the tongues, glowing through the time
Laying us low, let the energy unfold, baby, we were born to shine
