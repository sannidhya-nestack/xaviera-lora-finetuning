Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Beneath the city lights, our hearts be out of sight
In shadows we will find, the love so pure in mind
Sneak away from the crowd
Silent but all out loud
Whisper secrets unknown
In this hidden love zone
Love underground
Oh love underground
Listen to our hidden sound
Love underground
Oh love underground
Hearts together they confound
Running through tunnels deep
Secrets we wanna keep
No one can see us fall
In our secret lovers hall
No bright lights blinding us
Just our feelings and trust
Echoes of love so clear
Knowing you'll always be near
Love underground
Oh love underground
Listen to our hidden sound
Love underground
Oh love underground
Hearts together they confound
No bright lights blinding us
Just our feelings and trust
Echoes of love so clear
Knowing you'll always be near
Love underground, oh love underground
Listen to our hidden sound
Love underground, oh love underground
Hearts together they confound
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
