Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So for me, that's what makes a song or track hook special, unique
That's what I think about when I sit down to write a song
Music for me can express those types of feelings far better than any other language can
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
