This is for all you funny people out there
I know you can get down with this, yeah
Come on and feel the sky with me
Just wanna get sky high
Yeah, clap your hands, feel the sky high
Oh, just wanna feel sky high
Yeah, yeah, yeah
the lover gets gone
Here we go, come on
Sometimes I know that I get crazy with this life of mine
Exchanging pieces in the middle, it ain't no crime
But I feel there's something that you really ought to know (know, know, know, know, know, know, know)
If my spirit comes across the real light it will go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let me hear you sing this for the sky
Yeah, just let it sky
Just wanna feel sky
Yeah
Just learn to get sky
I wanna see you feel sky
Show me how you feel sky
This mental chain around my heart just seems to feel so tight
This flame that burns inside will always be the right
But I feel there's something you don't really understand
No, no, no, no, no, no, no you know, yeah
This time I'll spend each time to know where it will land
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I do wanna get sky high
Feel it, feel it, come on
Just make me sky high
Yeah, sky high
Just let me get sky high
Yeah, yeah
I wanna see you pull up to that sky high
Get sky high
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me get sky high
Let me get sky high
Let me get sky high
Now don't go thinking that I need to sign a bet I'm high
This groove is way too sweet don't need to kiss the sky
But I feel there's something that is really hard to say
Oh, oh, this music is my higher price
That's hard to pay
Ooh, ooh, I can't feel this without you
Does it wanna get sky high?
Sing it to me, sing it to me
Come on and sing it, come on and sing it to me
Come on and sing it, sing it to me
Sky high, I wanna sing this baby body with the big sky
Sky high, just let me get sky high
Just let me get sky high
Just let me get sky high
Sing it to me, sing it to me
Get more than sing it, get more than sing it
