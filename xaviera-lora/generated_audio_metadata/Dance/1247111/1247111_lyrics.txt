Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh -oh, oh-oh-oh
The city's alive, the night is young
Live vibes on, let's have some fun
Feeling myself in these new threads
Looking so fire from my head to my feet
All my legs that's gonna show
Making them do wherever we go
Confidence dancing, no need to prove
Watch me slay as I make my move
I'm that girl, the one you can't ignore
Still in the spotlight, you want more
Magnetic energy, captivating aura
Bow down, it's my time to reign, signora
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Flawless make-up, hair laid to trick
Hypnotizing moves, making jaws
Drop seven bucks, giving you life
This is just the start of my life
All eyes on me, that jealous stare
They can't compete, I'm too damn rare
Unbothered queen, so badass and bold
Let the haters hate while I'm stacking my rolls
I'm that girl, the one you can't ignore
Still in the spotlight, you want more
Magnetic energy, captivating aura
Bow down, it's my time to reign, signora
My confidence can't be shook, all these infants are killers
But I don't care, don't need their approval
I make my own rules, uh, uh
I make my own rules
I make my own rules
I make my own rules
One you can't ignore
Still in the spotlight
You want more
I'm that girl, the one you can't ignore
Skill in the spotlight, you'll want more
Magnetic energy, captivating aura
Bow down, it's my time to reign, signora
My confidence can't be shook
All these inferior looks
But I don't trip, don't get disapproved
I wanna make my own rules
I'll make my own rules
