I've been down this road so many times
And I know that tonight we're gonna survive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
All that it takes is one night to break
And then I'll catch your fall and
All that I need, all that I feel is love tonight
Oh, is the love tonight
Love tonight
All it takes is one last break and then I'll catch your fall
