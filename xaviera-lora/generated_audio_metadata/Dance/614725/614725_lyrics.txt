(audience chattering)
I'm windswept so my hair's mad shaggy
I'm kinda heavy but I'm not too flabby
I'm kinda talkative kinda like gabby
Must feel good cause the girls all want a grab
Ready ready ready so we ready fi di back inna
Hot to see ya come wid wah fear dat is chemical
We wid laugh a joke but do a thing wid simple
Weh certain things wid take personal why?
Ready ready ready so we ready fi di back inna

Ooh, yellow curtains shining down on me
Do you see what I see? Why am I not happy?
All I see is just this raging blue
It's like my heart's in two
You've got some blood on you
Bad summer bad boy suffer dem a Allah
