Emotions went away
No longer feel the same
But I see beauty in the small things
I hid it deep inside this universal mind
But it is vibrant all around me
So I'll be, I'll be, I'll be better than you left me
I'll be, I'll be better without you
Dancing in the starlight watching it glow
I could feel the warmth of letting you go, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
In the sparkle
Dancing in the starlight watching it glow
I could feel the warmth of letting you go, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
In the sparkle
I've learned to let you go
Be okay on my own inside the pigments of the memories
Those parts of me have changed
Moved on to brighter days still
Seeking beauty in the small things
So I'll be, I'll be, I'll be better than you left me
I'll be, I'll be better without you
Dancing in the starlight watching it glow
I could feel the warmth of letting you go, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
In the sparkle
Dancing in the starlight, watching it glow
I could feel the warmth of letting you go, uh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, in the sparkle
