Now it's time, time to say goodbye
You could have told me your reasons why
You spoiled things now with all those lies
No more chances for a second try
All you can do is stand there and pray
I told you now tell me the reason why
Only you know the reasons why
You keep on telling me those lies
Please don't stand there and cry
It's over now time to say goodbye
