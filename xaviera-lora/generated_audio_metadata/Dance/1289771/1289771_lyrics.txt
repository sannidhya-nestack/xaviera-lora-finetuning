Young lights, they paint the night, a restless pulse, a burning sight
Chasing rhythms, chasing schemes, lost in the echoes of our dreams
Some walk the line, some break away, some seek the dark, some crave the day
But every shadow plays its part, guided by the beating heart
Neon skin, I'm into him
Neon dreams are made of this
A spark, a touch, a fleeting kiss
Who am I to stop the flow?
Come on baby let's go
City streets they hum and sing a symphony of everything
Dancing whispers fading streams alive in a maze of neon dreams
Some build the walls some tear them down
Some wear the smiles some wear the crown
But every journey starts the same
Chasing sparks defeat the flame
Neon skin, I'm into him
Neon dreams are made of this
A spark, a touch, a fleeting kiss
Who am I to stop the flow?
Come on baby let's go
Come on baby let's go
We're caught in a loop, a velvet chain
Searching for meaning in the rain
Through every high, through every low
We find the path, push it forward, let's go
Neon skin, I'm into him
Neon dreams
I'm made of this (oh yeah)
A spark, a touch, a fleeting kiss
Who am I to stop the flow?
Come on baby let's go
Come on baby let's go
Neon dreams, they never fade
Sexy, sassy, books on lassi
Step by step, I love the scent
Forever in my lovely neon skin
We're caught in a loop
We're caught in a loop
Neon skin, I'm into him
Neon dreams, I'm made of this
A spark, a touch, a fleeting kiss
Who am I to stop the flow?
Come on baby let's go
Come on baby let's go
Neon dreams, they never fade
Sexy sassy, book some lassie
Step by step, I love the sin
Forever in my lovely neon skin
