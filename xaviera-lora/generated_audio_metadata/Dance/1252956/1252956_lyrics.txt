Sun is high, the air is thick
Lazy hours, the clock won't tick
Sweat drips slow, you don't mind
In this heat we unwind
Cicadas sing their summer song
In the shade where we belong
Watermelon, sticky sweet
Barefoot on the gravel street
Dark days delight under the sun
Every moment endless fun
In the stillness time stands still
Feel the warmth feel the thrill
Hammocks sway with the breeze
Laughter floats with such ease
Ice cream melts on messy trees
Cooling off in summer heat
Cicadas sing their summer song
In the shade where we belong
Watermelon sticky sweet
Barefoot on a gravel street
Dark days delight under the sun
Every moment endless fun
In the stillness time stands still
Feel the warmth feel the thrill
Hammocks sway with the breeze
Laughter floats with such ease
Ice cream melts, a messy treat
Cooling off in summer heat
Colden waves, all tanned skin
Let the summer days begin
Slipping stones across the pond
In these days were so fun
Time to pause, time to play
In the golden, hazy day
Sweat and smiles, pure delight
Underneath the sunlight bright
Dark days delight
Under the sun, every moment
Endless fun in the stillness
Time stands still
Feel the warmth, feel the thrill
As the sun dips out of sight
Memories of dark days fly
In our hearts they shine so bright
Holding on to dark days to light
