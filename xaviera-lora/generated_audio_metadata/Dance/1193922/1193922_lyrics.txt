All that we went through
Every morning wake up next to you
And the sun sneaks up on us
You look at me with those eyes
I can see that loving them is true
And I know we have it all
we do have trust but
I am clear on what I wanna do
All that we went through
Where we wanna be
And I know you're not telling me we're through
You say I'm your boo
But my head's like who outgrew who
Am I lying to myself
Am I lying to myself and you
You
Am I running from myself
Am I running from myself and you
You
Want you to be real
But it scares me too
Maybe you know that you can't bring me down or lift me up with you
Am I lying to myself, am I lying to myself and you, you, uh-huh, uh-huh
Hand in hand, I'm standing next to you
Yeah, we are invincible, who can bring us down?
Someday we'll take on the world together
Yeah, we said forever, I know you'll come through
But I am clear on what I wanna do
All that we went through
What we wanna be
And I don't hear you telling me we're through
You say I'm your boo
But my head's like who outgrew
Am I lying to myself?
Am I lying to myself and you?
You're lying to me, yeah
Am I running from myself?
Am I running from myself and you?
I'm running from, running from myself
Baby please be real
You know I'm scared too
Oh, you know you can't break me down
And lift me up with you
Am I lying to myself?
Am I lying to myself?
Thank you, you, oh-oh-oh-oh
