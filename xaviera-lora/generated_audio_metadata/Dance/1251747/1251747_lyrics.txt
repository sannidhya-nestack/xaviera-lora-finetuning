Woke up with a fire burning in my soul
Got a vision in my mind I'm ready to go
Been a world past waiting ain't no time to delay
Gonna hit the ground running find my way
Hit the ground running, no looking back
In the light of morning, on a brand new track
Every step we take, we're on the attack
The ground running, keep on the fast track
Heart beats racing feel the rush inside
With every moment passing let the future ride
In the heat of the chase where dreams ignite
Gonna hit the ground run and reach new heights
Hit the ground running, no looking back
In the light of morning, on a brand new track
Every step I take, we're on the attack
Hit the ground running, keep on the fast track
In the face of fear we won't slow down
In the storm we won't drown
With our eyes on the prize we won't break
Hit the ground running no mistake
As the sun is rising, casting golden light
We'll be standing stronger, ready for the fight
In the rhythm of life, we find our song
Gonna hit the ground running where we belong
Hit the ground running, no looking back
In the light of morning, on a brand new track
Every step we take, we're on the attack
The ground running, keep on the fast track
With the wind at our backs, we take our step
In the journey ahead, we're hand in hand
With our spirits high and our hearts so grand
The ground running, cross this land
