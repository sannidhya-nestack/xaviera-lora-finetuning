An air of mystery, it always follows me
So I never look back, no I never look back
The sound of closing steps accelerates my breath
So I never look back
No, I never look back
Your ghosting makes me cheerful
Its presence makes me fearful
Running through the shadows
Running through the shadows
Everything reminds me of the love behind me
Running through the shadows
Running through the shadows
Always haunting me your love still haunting me
I try to lose the past
A tear in every glass
So I never look back
No, I never look back
But the spectre of our love
Hovers here up above
So I never look back
No, I never look back
This freezing, creeping feeling
What is the dark concealing?
Running through the shadows
Running through the shadows
Everything reminds me of the love behind me
Running through the shadows
Running through the shadows
Always taunting me your love still haunting me
Running through the shadows
Running through the shadows
No I never look back
No I never look back
No I never look back
No I never look back
