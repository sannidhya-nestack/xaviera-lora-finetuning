I've been chasing pieces out of place
Trying to win a losing race
Told myself I'd get it right
If I held on just a little tight
But time doesn't wait and truth doesn't bend
And you don't get back what you never sent
Then one spark cut through the doubt
And I knew what life was really about
Not yesterday, not someday soon
It's beating loud in every room
It feels like now, it feels like far
Like every note just fed the wire
It feels like truth with nothing to prove
Like I'm finally standing in my shoes
No looking back
No second guess
I'm everything I haven't been yet
Yeah this is the sound
This is the vow
It feels like now
I don't need to finish the line to win
The magic's in the mess I'm in
Not waiting on a green light flash
I'm stepping on the gas
You can keep the map, I've got the flame
It's not a game, I have to name
The future's leaning into me
And I like what it believes
No rewind, no fading out
Just my voice and this new shout
It feels like now, it feels like fire
Like every note just fed the wire
It feels like truth with nothing to prove
Like I'm finally standing in my shoes
No looking back, no second guess
I'm everything I haven't been yet
Yeah this is the sound
This is the vibe it feels like now
I waited, hesitated, tried to find the right beat
Turns out the rhythm was always underneath
It feels like now, it feels like fire
Like every note just fed the wire
It feels like truth with nothing to prove
Like I'm finally standing in my shoes
No looking back, no second guess
I'm everything I haven't been yet
Yeah, this is the sound, this is the vow
It feels like now
Oh, it feels like now
