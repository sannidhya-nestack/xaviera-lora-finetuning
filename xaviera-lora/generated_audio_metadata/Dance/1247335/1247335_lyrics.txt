Waking up to silence in a sleepy town
Where the streets are empty and the sun goes down
Suburban houses standing all in a row
And the cracks of evening dreams begin to grow
Suburban stolen dreams lost in the night
Underneath the streetlights faded out of sight
Whispers in the shadows longing for the gleam
Suburban stolen dreams frozen in between
Children playing outside, but their minds are thought
Chasing hidden futures, wishing on a star
Parents talking softly of what could happen
In the quiet suburbs where the dreams begin
Suburban stolen dreams lost in the night
Underneath the streetlights faded out of sight
Whispers in the shadows long and horribly
Suburban stolen dreams frozen in between
Teenagers are restless, craving something more
In the endless cycle, they can't ignore
Broken hearts and secrets in disguise, so why?
Suburban stolen dreams where hopes collide
Suburban stolen dreams lost in the night
Underneath the street that's faded out of sight
Whispers in the shadow longing for the beat
Suburban stolen dreams frozen in between
In the stillness echoes of what could be
Suburban stolen dreams yearning to be free
In the night we find what it all means
Suburban stolen dreams chasing me unseen
To the stillness echoes of what could be
Suburban stolen dreams yearning to be free
In the night we find what it all means
Suburban stolen dreams chasing the unseen
