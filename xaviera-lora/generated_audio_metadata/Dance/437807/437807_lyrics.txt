Need to get away, really far away
From all the things that make me weary
Nine to five each day, want to jump and sway
In the fading light lies the promised night
Hot and long and so inviting
Want to feel so free, free as I can be
Take me dance, dance'til the morning
I don't want to be alone
Take me dance, dance'til the morning
I don't want to be alone
There's a groovy place where the music plays
Faces of the people jumpin'
Won't you take me there, oh please take me there
Dance, move, dance, dance
Beat goes on and on'til the break of dawn
There's no stopping once you've started
Want to feel so free, free as I can be
Take me dance dance till the morning
I don't want to be alone
Take me dance dance till the morning
I don't want to be alone
Take me dance dance till the morning
I don't want to be alone
Take me dance dance
'Til the morning
I don't want to be alone
They be dancing
Oh,'til the morning, oh
Take me dancing, oh
Take me dancing (take me dancing) to the morning (to the morning) I don't want to be alone
Take me dancing to the morning (to the morning) I don’t want to be alone
Take me dancing'til the morning
I don't want to be alone
Take me dancing'til the morning
I don't want to be alone
