When the sun turns hazy, I'm hanging with all my friends, ready or not, here we come, we're a beautiful mess
Crowd is getting crazy, doing things I will regret, won't matter, I'll remember to never et
When my heart is melting my hands will freeze, got to get your eyes on me
Do you wanna wanna do you want me to want ya
Do you wanna want me too
Do you wanna wanna do you want me to want you
Do you wanna want me too
Do you wanna wanna do you want me to want cha
Do you wanna want me too
Do you wanna wanna do you want me to wantcha
Do you wanna want me too
All I want is for You to want me
Only me
All I want is for You to want me
Heartbeats racing, living love in lalaland
Hope you're ready to let it go
Make your love do the test
Gonna make you chase me
So you're gonna take my hand
Sure you haven't ten times in a row
But save the best for last
When my heart is melting my head will freeze
When I have your eyes on me
Do you wanna wanna, do you want me to want ya?
Do you wanna want me too?
Do you wanna wanna, do you want me to want ya?
Do you wanna want me too?
Do you wanna wanna, do you want me to want ya?
Do you wanna want me too?
Do you wanna wanna be? Want me to want ya?
Do you wanna want me too?
All I want is you to want me, only me
All I need is you to need me, only me
All I want is you to want me, only me
All I need is you to need me
Got to give into me, just come and get it
Got to give into me, just come and get it
All I want is to see you've got your eyes on me
All I need is to feel you belong to me
All I want is to see you've got your eyes on me
All I need is to feel you belong to me
When my heart is melting my head will freeze
When I have your eyes on me
Do you wanna wanna? Do you want me to want ya? Do you wanna want me too?
