I found myself swimming
Tell me that
Of floating around
Been around seven days
People saying my name
Taking so wide a shame
Start all over again
You got me thinking again
What's it?
I've lost and I've found them
But you've been running alone
Been waiting for too long
Can it be simple once?
Start all over again
What's it?
Was it you when you told me I'd die?
Everything would be fine again
Everything would be fine again
Maybe this is our time
Everything
Nothing's keeping me warm
I should get used to it
Someone should never be sad
Doesn't matter how I feel
Start all over again
What's it, what's it to when you talk me out of mine
Everything will be fine again
Everything will be fine again
What's it, what's it to when you talk me out of my mind?
And everything would be fine again
Everything will be fine again
