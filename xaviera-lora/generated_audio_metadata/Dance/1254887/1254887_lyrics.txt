The skies are careless painted hues
Crimson waves and orange mules
We're driving down a winding road
Chasing color stories told, told
Feel the warmth of days grip by
Whispers of a gentle sigh
Golden rays that kiss the sea
Moments here just you and me
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Sun sets, sizzle in the air
Burning bright without a care
Colors melt, the world ignites
In this glow our hearts take flight
Mountains cast their shadow gray, soft reflections on your face
Hand in hand we trace the shore, every sunset calls for more
Feel the warmth of days goodbye, whispers of a gentle sigh
Golden rays that kiss the sea, moments here just you and me
Sunset sizzle in the air
Burning bright without a care
Colors melt, the world ignites
In this glow our hearts take flight
Rises blend a blazing crest
Find our place where we are blessed
Every glance a silent vow
In the dusk forever now
Sun sets sizzle in the air (in the air)
Burning bright without a care (without a care)
Colors melt the world ignites
In this glow our hearts take flight
As the sun dips low we find
In this love entwined in kind
Sunset sizzle never fades
In our hearts the warmth remains
