White flowers bloom
I gather the fragrance on my own
White stars in the gloom
I gather to brilliance for my own
You take me in your arms and hold me close to charm
You fold me right into your heart
You fill me with your warmth
Spread my wings and soar away'cause with you I'm gonna fly
Spread my wings and soar away'cause with you I'm gonna fly
Every moment, the colors sing in cadence
Sparkling hopes every moment, glittering in silence
You take me in your arms and hold me close to jump
You fold me right into your heart
You fill me with your warmth, spread
Spread my wings and soar away'Cause with you I'm gonna fly
Spread my wings and soar away'Cause with you I'm gonna fly
Spread my wings and soar away'Cause with you I'm gonna fly
Spread my wings and soar away'cause with you I'm gonna fly
