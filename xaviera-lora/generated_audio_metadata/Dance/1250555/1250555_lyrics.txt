Bury lips shine bright, underneath your light
Dancing through the night, feels so right
Bury lips just kiss, in a moment of bliss
Can't resist this twist, pure and crisp
Bury lips, touch the sky
Feel alive, never shine
Berry lips, we can fly
Chase the moon, you and I
Berry lips whisper, secrets in my ear
Laughing with the fear, you're so near
Berry lips are sweet, rhythm in the beat
Lose it on repeat, dancing feet
Berry lips, a taste, don't let it go to waste
In this lovely space, hearts race
Berry lips just kiss in a moment of bliss
Can't resist this twist, pure and crisp
Berry lips touch the sky, feel alive never shy
Berry lips touch the sky, feel alive never shy
Berry lips whisper
Secrets in my ear
Laughing without fear
You're so near
Berry lips are sweet
Rhythm in the beat
Listen on repeat
Dancing feet
Berry lips a taste
Don't let it go to waste
In this lovely space
Hearts race
Her lips are sweet, rhythm in the beat
Lose it on repeat, dancing feet
