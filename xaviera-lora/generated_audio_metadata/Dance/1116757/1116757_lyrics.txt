Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've got one hand
Two hands
Two feet
And one heart
I can only be at one place at one time
Better stop pulling me here and there or you're gonna lose it
a man can only take this much
You better slow it down now
I'm just a man that's trying to be the best he can
I'm just a man that's searching for some peace of mind
Would you let me have it
Or you're gonna lose everything right now
Moda moda rock it baby
Moda moda rock it baby
Moda moda rock it baby
All I want is my peace of mind
All I want is fame and circle
All I need is
One time
I can only be in one place at one time
I'm fighting these demons one at a time
Just a man in search of peace of mind
Just a man trying to be the best he can
One time
One at a time
One time
You don't have to overwork this distance
It's not the way that it goes
That ain't the way it should be
Let everything just work out at its own time
Moda moda rocka baby
Moda moda rocka baby
Moda moda rocka baby
One time
I can only be in one place at one time
I'm fighting these demons one at a time
It's the man who searches for peace of mind
It's the man who tries to be the best he can
One time
One at a time, one time
You don't have to overwork this system
It's not the way that it goes
That ain't the way it should be
Let everything just work out at its own time
