Just a flip of a switch
And we got no more resistance
Like a bolt from the blue
Babe I'm coming for you
You know it's gonna be now
Yeah nothing can stand in the way
Nothing can stop this thing we started
If there's a city of trees or a tower of stone
You know I'm knockin'em down, yeah
Ya la la la la
You're movin' like you got a sting inside the back of your skin
Ya la la la la
And I'm movin' like I got a shot at that adrenaline
We get off the ground
We go cloud to cloud
Baby bounce around
Move it like
We are birds screaming out
Lightning reaching out
Move it like
Electricity, electricity, electricity, electricity, electricity
But I still need a quick goodbye from you to me
A little shock to the heart
You get it spinning like a pinwheel
You know it's fully evaporating
Power generating
Feeling the flow, oh
Only darkness before
You put the stars up in the city
Yeah life is a dream that I just couldn't see
But now everything glows
Ya-la-la-la-la, you're moving like a cat
Sting inside the back of your skin
Ya-la-la-la-la, and I'm moving like a cat
I shout at that adrenaline
We get off the ground, we go cloud to cloud
Baby bounce around, moving like
We are birds dreaming now, lightning reaching down
Moving like electricity
Electricity, electricity, electricity, electricity
But I still need a quick goodbye from you to me
Once you grab hold, you can't let it go, no
That chill up your spine, that's how you know
Once you grab hold, can't let it go
(La, la, la, la)
Oh, I wanna chill up your spine
Electricity (electricity)
Electricity (electricity)
Electricity (electricity)
Now everything glows (oh, oh)
Electricity (electricity)
Electricity, Electricity, Electricity, Electricity
But I still need a quick goodbye from you to me
