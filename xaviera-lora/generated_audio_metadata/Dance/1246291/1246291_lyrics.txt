Work the magic on your heart
Lost your mind right from the start
Feel the rhythm take control
Let the music find your soul
You can't resist my charm
Get lost in my smile
Dancing under stars, staying with me a while
Catch my breath and feel the heat
In this moment we compete
In this moment we compete
Every beat pulls you closer
Every touch you're falling over
Lost in lights we all the night in my arms feels so right
