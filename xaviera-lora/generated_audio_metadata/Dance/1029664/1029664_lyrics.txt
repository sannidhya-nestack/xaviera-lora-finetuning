There's a dark cloud on the horizon
But the love keeps shining on through
We gotta be strong, yeah
We gotta be strong, oh
There ain't no dream
There ain't no dream
That we can't achieve
We gotta be tough
We gotta be strong
Shining on through yeah
We gotta be tough yeah
We gotta be strong, yeah, yeah
There's a dark cloud
But the light keeps shining on through
Shining on through
