I know that I am in control
Open up, feel the chills from head to toe
Oh, I can see colors of a celebration
This can be the most beautiful sensation
Can you feel the sparkle of the happiness in you?
I can feel the sparkle of the happiness in me, oh
It's the sound answering my desire
The attraction pulls me way up higher
I can see colors of a celebration
This can be the most beautiful sensation
Can you feel the sparkle of the happiness in you
I can feel the sparkle of the happiness in me
Can you feel the sparkle of the happiness in you
I can feel the sparkle of the happiness in me
I can see colors of a celebration
This can be
Feel the most beautiful sensation
Can you feel the sparkle of the happiness in you?
I can feel the sparkle of the happiness in me
Can you feel the sparkle of the happiness in you?
I can feel the sparkle of the happiness in me
Can you feel the sparkle of the happiness in you
I can feel the sparkle
In me, in me
Can you feel the sparkle of the happiness in you?
I can feel the sparkle of the happiness in me, in me
