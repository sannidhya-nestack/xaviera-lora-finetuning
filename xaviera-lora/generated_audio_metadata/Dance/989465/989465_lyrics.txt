I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I won't let you go, I won't let you go
The arrow made found my throne
The triple sounds speed my flesh and bones
And all I've got denied I want to hide
Brown light goes in the dark
The brightness is here to find
I'm breathing slow air
Wondering for reasons known only to myself
I changed the way
As if the sin had been already set by whom
Guess me, guess me
Encrypted moon, flooded the sun
But if my life ain't that
We start the night
My mind alright
The breathing's falling next to me
Oh, we've got the night
We want to, we want to hide from light
in the dark the brightest sea
The earth it finds
I know this is my home
I know this is my home
I know this is my home
I know this is my home
I need love, this is my home
I need love, this is my home
