A silver light above
Neon skies below
I get lost in your
Irresistible glow
Why you so magnetic
I can't let go
Why you so electric
Irresistible glow
Glow
Why you so magnetic
I can't let go
Why you so electric
Irresistible
Glow
You got me dancing
Under city stars
Heartbeats with your pose
On electric guitars
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
