Morning sun, a gentle start
Every day you steal my heart
In your eyes I find my place
Every moment sweet embrace
Pulse for words and laughter pure
In your arms I feel secure
Every heartbeat syncs with mine
Endless love, a sweet dissonance
Love, don't et every day
In your touch you find my way
Through the highs and through the lows
With you my heart forever knows
Mornings talks in quiet sighs
Every tear and every smile
Side by side we face it all
In this journey we won't fall
Whisper words and laughter pure
In your arms I feel secure
Every heartbeat syncs with mine
Endless love a sweet design
Love won't repeat everyday
In your touch I find my way
Through the highs and through the lows
With you my heart forever knows
Every sunrise, every kiss
Moments that we never miss
Hand in hand we take the leap
Building memories love so deep
Love on repeat everyday
Your touch I find my way
Through the highs and through the lows
With you my heart forever knows
In this loop we find our beat
Every moment love so sweet
With you life feels so complete
Together love on repeat
Every sunrise, every kiss
Moments that we never miss
Hand in hand we take the leap
Building memories love so deep
When this song we find our beat
Every moment love so sweet
With you life feels so complete
Together love on repeat
