The iconic Barbara Coleman
Lord knows she had so many
In the heart of DC, a light shone bright
Barbara Coleman, the beacon in the night
With a ballad as diverse as her beats, her life
A canvas of extraordinary feats
From Texas roots to the world's grand stage
She danced through life, defying age
Her brush strokes bold, her rhythm tight
In art and music, this girl took flight
The iconic Barbara Coleman
The iconic Barbara Coleman
A queen of style, a muse of sound
It was King C, she was totally unbound
A DJ with a heart spun pure gold
In every playlist another bold story told
From Houston's hustle to DC's streets
Her life a symphony of eclectic beats
With acrylics and collages
She set trends in her melodies
A message she sends
The iconic Harvard Coleman
The iconic Harvard Coleman
In the corridors of embassies, her art resides
Across continents, her spirit glides
A foreign service life, adventure in her eyes
In every city, her spirit flies
A designer, a collector, a visionary true
In her vibrant home, cultures brew
From Indo-Chinese arts, Afro-African grace
Each piece in her collection found its place
Her legacy, a tapestry so rare
In every note, a love affair
With music, art and life's embrace
She left this world a more beautiful place
So here's to the marvel of DJ Supreme
In the halls of art, not just a dream
A life well lived, a journey grand
In the beat of my heart, she'll forever stand
Lord knows she had soul, man
