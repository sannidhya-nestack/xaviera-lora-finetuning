Feels like a cardinal sin
When you look at me
Building chemistry in my veins
I hate to take risks
This is more than me
This nuclear energy burns my brain
You're on my mind, a free ride, it feels right
A losing hand that suddenly wins, mm-hmm
I can't deny your white lies that prove right
Seem to make my hungry heart sing
But when my heart takes over
I know I'll be flying blind and lose my mind
And when my heart takes over
It will be your name that's been signed across the sign
No matter how it takes and my knees shake
I will get you on my grind to make you mine
When my heart takes over
I don't dare to exhale
It's like this fairy tale
That chains are ripped I scale
Earthquake in love
I'm releasing my veil
I'll song my holy grail
It's like a ship that sails in the skies above
I'll fantasize on this night, our first light
It's head over heels, this thing
I can't disguise my heart cries, how time flies
When I feel the state I'm in
But when my heart
I know I'll be flying blind, I'll lose my mind
And when my heart takes over
It will be your name that's been signed across the sign
No matter how it takes, and my knees shake
I will get you on my grind to make you mine
When my heart takes over
I won't be living a lie, living a lie
When my heart takes over
We'll be dancing in the rain, in the rain
When my heart takes over
I broke love ages for losing game, no losing game
When my heart takes over
When my heart takes over (heart takes over)
When my heart takes over (heart takes over)
When my heart takes over (heart takes over)
When my heart takes over (heart takes over)
When my heart takes and my knees shake
I will get you on my grind to make you mine (on my grind, on my grind)
When my heart takes over
I want me living the life, living the life
