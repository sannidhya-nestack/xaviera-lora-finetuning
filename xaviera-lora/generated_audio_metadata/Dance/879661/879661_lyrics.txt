It's so hot out, makes me feel better, no matter what it is, put our hands together
I love my country,'cause it's my home, whatever it take, I'ma hit the goal
I can never give you love when we say no, together we'll pray for tomorrow (tomorrow, tomorrow)
Together we will pray for tomorrow (tomorrow)
To get it we'll pay
Who's there waiting for the town
I can't make it full cause everything is now
Run around sir you gotta take it slow
Bustin on the bean bag everything go low
Troubling, hustling, blabbering, jangling
I ain't give a damn
But I need to be patient
I feel the hell of it
Most people dancing me
Don't know why the people love trouble to me
It can't explain why they will never let be me
I'm on my own
I need no business at all
I'm on my home, waiting my own world, I'ma do the heat, the cold
North for north, explanation, cultivation
Dedication to provocation, more the more the nation
You never do my thing, you're blaming me when you're close to me
So harder, makes you feel better, no matter what it is, we put our hands together
I love my country'cause it's my home, what I gotta give, I'ma have to go
I do everything you love, I'ma say no, together we pray for tomorrow
Together we will pray for tomorrow (tomorrow, tomorrow)
Together we will pray (yeah, yeah)
It's so hard and so clever, everything is fine
The world is a better place, one better day no matter what it takes
The apple's eyes are spinning in
Struggling, struggling, yeah
I can't believe that I feel so troubled and everything is hate
Trying to understand what I'm seeing within that I am going insane
Don't doubt the training that has to be so hard to make it all insane
It feels so tough, don't feel so bad
When it's too much, you don't pass well
If you don't like it, better get behind it
Don't step your shoes on another man's throne
Struggling and hustling, pinning and gobbling
Peace and troubling, throwing and wrestling
Muddled and grumbling, lusher and hungering
For the speed, the world will change
You make it all back down
In my country, living so luxury
No, no hungry, no need to fear
Sing a song, we'll be together all day long
It's so hard to hide, we should do better
No matter what it is, put our heads together
You're in my country,'cause it's my home
For the hurricane, got my head to go
Nothing like hearing the moon say no
Together we'll pray for tomorrow
(Tomorrow)
Together we'll pray for tomorrow
(Tomorrow, tomorrow)
Together we'll pray
It's so hard to make you feel better
No matter what it is, put your hands together
I wanna love country'cause it's my home
I wanna put a flag on my head for gold
And when I clean it up I say no
Together we'll pray for tomorrow
(Tomorrow, tomorrow)
Together we will pay for tomorrow
Together we will pay
Look at those guys!
