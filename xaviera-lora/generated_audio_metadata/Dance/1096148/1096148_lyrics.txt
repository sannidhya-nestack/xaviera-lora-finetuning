Spendin' our money like there's no payday
Couché Louis Fendi, this is how we pray
Being young means no time for regret
No time, no time for regret
No time for regret
Don't try to find, don't try to find, don't try to find
We're lost tonight, we're lost tonight, we're lost tonight
Don't try to find, don't try to find, don't try to find
We're lost tonight
Don't try to find, don't try to find, don't try to find
We're lost tonight, we're lost tonight, we're lost tonight
Don't try to find, don't try to find, don't try to find
We're lost tonight
Drinkin' and lovin', lovin'
Join us, darlin', darlin'
Drinkin' and lovin', lovin'
Join us, darlin'
Drinkin' and lovin', lovin'
Join us, darlin', darlin'
Drinkin' and lovin', lovin'
Join us darling
Don't try to find, don't try to find, don't try to find
We're lost tonight, we're lost tonight, we're lost tonight
Don't try to find, don't try to find, don't try to find
We're lost tonight
Don't try to find, don't try to find, don't try to find
We're lost tonight, we're lost tonight, we're lost tonight
Don't try to find, don't try to find, don't try to find
We're lost tonight
