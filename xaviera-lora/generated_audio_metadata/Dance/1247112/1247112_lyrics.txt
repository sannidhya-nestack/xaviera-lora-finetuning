Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, yeah
Melling clouds my mind
Trapped in this lonely confinement
(Confinement)
Known to the world outside
Fading light, emotional drought
A something stirs within
A flicker of hope reignites
I feel a rhythm beginning
To shake off these lonely nights
The beat drops, bassline thumps
Euphoria, electricity pumps
Feel my veins breaking these chains
Music is the remedy, curing all my pains
On the dining floor, I'm reborn
And the visions left behind
Worries and fears no longer mourn
In this safe haven I can shine
The melodies wash over me
A sonic tidal wave to detox
Flesh transgressive harmonies
Rinse away thoughts of self torture
The beat drops, bassline thumps
You for hold electricity pumps
Feel my veins breaking these chains
Music is the remedy, cure all my pains (ooh-ah) (ooh-ah) (ooh-ah)
Lose myself in the rhythm, so far from the world's clues
This atmosphere, this unreal atmosphere
Is where I truly feel at home
The big drops, baseline thumps
You forehold electricity pumps
Through my veins, breaking these chains
Music is the remedy curing all my pains
