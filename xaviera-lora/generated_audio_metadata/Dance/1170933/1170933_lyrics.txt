Met you up at a bar
Ain't nobody see you're going wild
We don't know just how far
Temperature is rising
I see you fantasizing
I'll have you here
Until sunrise
You hold me near
Look in my eyes
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Like that
Mm-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Easy time I kill the lights
You look like trouble and I like that
Save me all your Friday nights
Got you tasting my Chanel
Call me Kokuman Moise
I'll have you here
Until sunrise
You hold me near
Look in my eyes
I can't waste all night with you
Just to find a place for two
With the view all around
I ain't ready'cause you knew
That the city makes us do
Crazy things, are you down?
Mmm, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
