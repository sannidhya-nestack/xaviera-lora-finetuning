Come on!
My mouth starts lifting at the corners, tongue's a wild ride
You've written joy up on my face in letters ten feet wide
I'll jump with electricity when your hand touches mine
A living breathing sculpture of the way I feel inside
Your air be my emotions, I'm buzzy like a neon sign
You got me smiling, lips curl up keep rising
Glowing like the sun in the morning sky
There's no denying, teeth flash bright as lightning
Beaming like a torch in the black of night
You know you got me smiling, oh oh oh
You know you got me smiling, oh oh oh
Bones are radiating, shake my body into life
Your kisses drop like falling bombs, exploding in my mind
Lungs fill up with laughter'til my eyes begin to stream
Your happiness bumps through my veins in waves of ecstasy
This party's getting started, I'm bubbling like a smoke machine
You got me smiling, lips curl up keep rising
Glowing like the sun in the morning sky
There's no denying, teeth flash bright as lightning
Beaming like a torch in the black of night
You know you got me smiling, oh oh oh
You know you got me smiling, oh oh oh
Find myself delirious with positivity
Feel so incredible the change you've made to me
You got me smiling, lips curl up keep rising
Blowing like the sun in the morning sky
There's no denying
Deep flesh bright as lightning
Beaming like a torch in the black of night
You got me smiling
Let your good love keep rising
Growing like the sun in the morning sky
There's no denying
Deep flesh bright as lightning
Beaming like a torch in the black of night
No you got me smiling
Oh, no you got me smiling
Oh, girl you got me smiling
Oh, no you got me smiling
Oh
