Hey, hey
Fire in the sky, I see it getting higher
Drums keep beating in my heart
Don't say these words, I know you are a liar
I knew this right from the start
You think you can play me just like the others
Move me around your board like this
Let me tell you now, one thing you'll discover
You're playing with a serpent's kiss
This girl ain't overseas
Like her, she don't back down
Don't mess with Bodeci
This queen don't wear no crown, woah
Oh, oh, booty cut, woah
Oh, oh, oh, woah, woah
Oh, oh, booty cut, woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Walls tear down, you think that you got me in your sights
So true tonight
Don't blink twice'cause then you just won't see
This girl's heart she wants to find
You think you can play me just like the others
Move me around your board like this
Let me tell you now one thing you'll discover
You're playing with a serpent's kiss
This girl ain't bow to sea
Like her, she don't back down
Don't mess with bow to sea
This queen's the one I'll crown
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, booty car
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-whoa-whoa
Whoa-oh-oh, booty car
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-whoa-whoa
I think you can play me just like the others
Move me around your board like this
Let me tell you now one thing you'll discover
You're playing with the sevens king
This girl ain't bold to see
Like her she don't back down
Don't mess with bold to see
This queen don't wear no crown
This girl ain't bold to see
Like her she don't back down
Don't mess with her tonight
This queen don't wear no crown
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
