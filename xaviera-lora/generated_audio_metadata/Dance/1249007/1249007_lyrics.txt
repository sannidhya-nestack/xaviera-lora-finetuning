Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woke up late, the clock is ticking fast
Running through the moments gotta make them last
Every second counts, can't afford to waste
I got no time to lose, life's a frantic chase
I got no time, no time is fair
Living in the fast lane everywhere
Chasing dreams, I can't rewind
I got no time, gotta stay on the grind
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Skipping breakfast, heading out the door
Every step a hustle, always wanting more
Calendar is full, every hour planned
I got no time for breaks, gotta take a stand
I got no time, no time to spare
Living in the fast lane everywhere
Chasing dreams, I can't rewind
I got no time, gotta stay on the grind
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
In the rush I find my strength
Pushing limits going to great lengths
No slowing down, no looking back
I got no time to fall off track
Midnight oil burning working through the night
Colours are in my sight, shining so bright
Every minute matters, can't afford to slow
I got no time to stop, watch me as I go
I got no time, no time to spare
Living in the fast lane everywhere
Chasing dreams, I can't rewind, I got no time
Gotta stay on the grind
In the chaos, I find my own way
Living for tomorrow, season to day
No regrets, I'm on the climb, I got no time
Making every second mine
In the chaos, I'll find my way
Living for tomorrow, seize it today
No regrets, I'm on the climb, I got no time
In every second mine
