And every glance is a spark in disguise
Every move pulls me closer inside
In the noise you're the rhythm I find
Like a map that rewrites in my mind
All the distance keeps breaking away
Every moment is telling me stay
Gravity knows where I belong
Pulls me in deep and spin you all along
No reason left, I don't need control
Gravity knows, it's under my soul
Gravity knows, I can't deny every breath leads me back to your side
The louder the world, the stronger it shows
Gravity knows, gravity knows
We collide but the motion is sweet
Every step keeps repeating the beat
Even storms couldn't wash this away
You're the truth I keep chasing each day
All the distance keeps breaking away
Every moment is telling me stay
Gravity knows where I belong
Pulls me in deep and spin you all along
No reason left, I don't need control
Gravity knows
It's under my soul, gravity knows
I can't deny every breath leads me back to your side
The louder the world, the stronger it shows
Gravity knows, gravity knows
I don't fight it, I don't pretend
Every start only meets at the end
Nothing else ever pulls me the same
Every road just repeats your name
Gravity knows where I belong
Pulls me in deep, it's been you all along
No reason left, I don't need control
Gravity knows it's under my soul
Gravity knows, I can't deny every breath leads me back to your side
The louder the world, the stronger it shows, gravity
Gravity knows, gravity knows, yeah, gravity knows
