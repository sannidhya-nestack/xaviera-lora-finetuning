Eyes, weak hearts collide
Moments share side by side
In this world where we confide
Special intentions we can't hide
Special intentions in our hearts
Every day a new start
Love and hope play their parts
Special intentions make us smart
Words spoken softly clear
Feelings grow without fear
In this space where we are near
Special intentions always here
Special intentions in our hearts
Every day a new start
Love and hope play their parts
Special intentions make us smart
Dreams we chase so bold
In our story we hold
Finding treasures like gold
Special intentions unfold
I'm gonna start
Where we stand hand in hand
So grand future dreams we command
Special intentions well planned
Special intentions in our hearts
Every day a new start
Love and hope play their parts
Special intentions make us smart
In this journey we seek
All that we can be
Living wild and free
Special intentions set us free
