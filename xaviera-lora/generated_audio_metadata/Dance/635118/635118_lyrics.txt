Bankrupt and ashamed
You stumble through the days
Feeling weakly sentimental
Kinda bored, kinda bored
Dance like a puppet on a slowly fraying string
It's easy and you're easily ignored
Don't feed, no don't pursue it
Don't be so driven to it
Everybody on your block says
You're not gonna make it
And that you can't escape it
So close your eyes and fake it
Yeah, everybody on your block says
You can't keep pretending
They don't know all you have is nothing left to lose
That's your point of view
I'm not arguing with you
I'm just trying to explain
That it's a lie (it's a lie)
If you make up easy answers
To the questions you won't ask
When the reasons slip away
Don't act surprised
Act surprised
Don't feed, no don't pursue it
Don't be so driven to it
Everybody on your block says
You're not gonna make it
And that you can't escape it
So close your eyes and fake it
Yeah, everybody on your block says
You can't keep protecting me
And they don't know all you have
Is nothing left to lose
Everybody in this arbitrary conference is just pretend
Rearrange the planes and pieces in your head
Rearrange the planes and pieces in your head
Everybody on your boxes (impossible)
You're not gonna make it (there's gonna be no way)
And that you can't escape it (you can't be incredible)
So close your eyes and fake it (you can't stop the change)
Yeah, everybody on your boxes (you're like impossible)
You can't keep protecting me
They don't know all you have is nothing left to lose (impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible)
