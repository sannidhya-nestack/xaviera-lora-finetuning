Ain't got love
Ain't got love
I've got nothing if I ain't got love
I'm breaking all the rules that I know
Burning all the bridges as I go
Doing what I can to build my fortress, yeah
The higher that my buildings all grow
The higher all my fences are, you know
What is in the way of our real treasure, yeah
And I'm broken down'cause I got lost
Chasing the crowds for any cause
Believing I could conquer it all
And I'm falling down when I got it all
When I thought all I had would be enough
Now I see it's time from above
Ain't got love
I got nothing to fight
Ain't got love
Ain't got love
Ain't got love
Happiness is something we all measure
Will you find your peace in what you own?
If you never loved then you never had anything
You'll never know
The higher that my built-ins all grow
The higher all my fences are, you know
What is in the way of our real treasure?
And I'm broken down'cause I got lost
Chasing the crowds for any cause
Believing I could conquer it all
And I'm falling down, when I got it all
When I thought all I had would be enough
Now I see, it's time from above
I've got nothing if I ain't got love
Ain't got love
Ain't got love, ain't got love
