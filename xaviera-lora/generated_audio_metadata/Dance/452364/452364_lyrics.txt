You spent the night with me
I think you should come inside
Do you want the cake?
I need it
Give it to me
(I need it, I need it, I need it)
Right there
(I need it, I need it, I need it)
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'll get it tomorrow
I need it. Give it to me.
Come spend the night with me
I think you should come inside
Do you want to look at it?
I need it
Give it to me
I'm not right there
Give it to me
Let's do it again
