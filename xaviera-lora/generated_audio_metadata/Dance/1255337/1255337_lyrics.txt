(Light it for the city, connections real weedy)
(From the Gulf's beach racing, whole world changing)
(Dark pink flash, sharks flash like titans)
(Quick flex on the wrist, time writing)
(Got that rush, no fuss, double dutch)
(Climbing steep peaks, lost in much)
(Ocean in the ocean, bunchin' of devotion)
(Speeding on highways, lovin' on sideways)
(Zoom calls to moon falls, night crawls)
(I'ma rush to the halls, text installed)
(Hearts lit, sync like Bluetooth)
Fast track, no slack, undisputed truth
Rapid love, can't get enough
Throttled engines, no suspension
Blinking miss electric kicks
Rapid love, can't get enough
Feel high flying, never trying
Paradise speeding
Hearts on weeding
Ill-ill-infant weeding
Hearts are leading
Shuffle dances and romance, lightning on veins, no restraints
Cupid's arrow, Ferrari, no sorrow, quick thrills, no tomorrow
Peace and fast, time blast, flames roar, can't ignore, ask no more
Strike bright, ignite tonight, bright, the end of delight, feel that slight
Fast forwarded sense, no defense, love hack, thought prevents
Raw speed, fulfilling need, pure breed, blinks pace
Hearts race, love's a chase
Rapid love, can't get enough
Throttled engines, no suspension
Blinking, it's electric kiss
Rapid love, can't get enough
Feel high flying, never trying
Paradise speeding
Hearts are weeding
If nothing's a weeding
Hearts are weeding
