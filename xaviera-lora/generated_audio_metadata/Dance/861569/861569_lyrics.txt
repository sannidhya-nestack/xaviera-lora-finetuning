When I saw you, when I saw you, when I saw you, when saw you
When I saw you standing right in front of me
I heard the angels sing and I became yours eternally
When I looked into your eyes love opened the door
And I had to realize that nothing was like before
I've got so much more
I didn't know you
Didn't need you,'til the day I met you
Now I look for you everywhere you're in my heart
Like a prayer now, and I never felt the way I do
the day I met you
When you spoke so honestly I had to give in
To this sweet fantasy and the world began to spin
When you touched my hand I knew right away
That you'd be the one to mend everything that went astray
Baby let me say I do know you
Didn't need you'til the day I met you
Now I look for you everywhere you're in my heart
Like a prayer now
And I never felt the way I do'til the day I met you
Sometimes love can be a real surprise
Just like a ray of light at sunrise
And everything seems so new
And all I've dreamed of will come true
I didn't know you (I didn't know you)
Didn't need you (Didn't need you)
Till the day I met you
Now I look for you (for you)
And it's weighing on my heart
Like a brand now (like a brand now)
When I never felt the way I do
Till the day I met you (I didn't know you)
Didn't need you (didn't need you)
Till the day I met you (met you)
Now I look for you
Everywhere you hit my heart like a brand new
And I never felt the way I do
Till the day I met you, met you, met you, met you, oh
Till the day I met you
Till the day I met you
