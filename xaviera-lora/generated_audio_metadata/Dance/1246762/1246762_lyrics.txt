Midnight shadows whisper tales of old
In the witching hour secrets to unfold
Candles flicker softly in the cool night breeze
Superstitions linger, haunting memories
Witching hour, spirits in the air
Superstitious, find us everywhere
Underneath the moonlight where the shadows cower
We face the magic of the witchy hour
Black cats gloss up as we hold our breath
Broken mirrors bring the feel of death
In the quiet darkness whispers fill our ears
Witching hour plays upon our fears
Wishing hour, spirits in the air
Superstitions find us everywhere
Underneath the moonlight where the shadows cower
We face the magic of the wishing hour
Oh, watch tales and stories pack through time
In the witching hour with you in mine
Soak on those shoulders like he charms
Inhale in the dance of faith
We understand
Wishing our spirits in the air
Superstitions find us everywhere
Underneath the moonlight where the shadows cower
We face the magic of the witching hour
As the clock strikes twelve, we heed the signs
In the witching hour, we read the lines
Through the veil of night, superstition flows
In the moonsong flow, the magic grows
Witching hour, spirits in the air
Superstitions find us everywhere
Underneath the moonlight, there the shadows come roll
In the moons and every hidden power
Standing on it in the witching hour
In the still of night where fears live our world
Find our strength in the witching hour
With every omen every hidden power
Standing on it in the witching hour
