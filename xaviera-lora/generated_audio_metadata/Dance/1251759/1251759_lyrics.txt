In the quiet of the morning where the unknown lies
I feel the pull of something underneath the skies
A whisper in the silence, a promise in the air
A door that's slowly opening, taking me somewhere
Oh, the opportunity, it's calling out to me
A moment of infinity where I am meant to be
Hold an opportunity, a chance to break free
Unfolding every possibility, it's all that I can see
Through the haze of hesitation, I can see it clear
A path that's never taken, a way without fear
Every step is courage, every breath is new
I'm chasing down the heartbeat that only I pursue
Hold an opportunity, it's calling out to me
On the moment of infinity where I am meant to be
Hold an opportunity, a chance to break free
Unfolding every possibility, it's all that I can see
From the pulse of transformation in the wave of change
I find a revelation in the rearrange
No more second guessing, no more standing still
I'm reaching for the future, bending time and will
Pulled an opportunity, it's calling out to me
A moment of infinity where I am meant to be
Pulled an opportunity, a chance to break free
Unfolding every possibility, it's all that I can see
Of an opportunity, the world in my hands
A symphony of chances, breaking all demands
Of an opportunity, I'm taking the stand
Writing my own story across the shifting sands
