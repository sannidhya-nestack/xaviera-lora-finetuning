Underneath the surface where the secrets lie
In the quiet moments we can't deny
Polished dreams and memories shining bright
Mint condition everything feels right
Mint condition flawless and true
In this world it's me and you
Every touch a perfect rendition
Living life in mint condition
Through the trials and the tests we remain a star
In the game of life we play our cards
Every step we take a new tradition
Holding on in mint condition
Mint condition all is in true
In this world it's me and you
Every touch a perfect rendition
Living life in mint condition
Through the trials and the tests we remain as art
In the game of life we play our cards
Every step we take a new tradition
Holding on in mint condition
Mint condition flawless and true
In this world it's me and you
Every touch perfect rendition
Living life in mint condition
In the chaos we find our calm
In the storm, you're my song
Every moment, pure and clear
Mint condition, always near
As the seasons change, we stay the same
In this picture perfect frame
Through the highs and lows, our love's ignition
Together in mint condition
In condition, flawless and true
In this world it's me and you
Every touch, perfect rendition
Living life in incondition
In the end we hold the key
To a life that's pure and free
Every day, our love's mission
Forever in incondition
