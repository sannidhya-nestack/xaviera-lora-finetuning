Everybody gather'round, it's time to hear the sound
Lights are dancing, hearts are pounding, feel the rhythm all around
We're breaking through the walls, standing tall for it all
In this moment we are golden, let the echoes never fall
Hey now, you're a superstar
Let your light shine, take the stage
Hey now, raise the bar
Step into the light, turn the page
And all the dreams that we hold
Are written in the stars
Together we will go far
Somebody once said
Chase the light inside your heart
You'll find your way when it's dark
With every step we take making memories that stay
In this story we are glory every move a new day
Hey now you're a superstar, let your light shine, take the stage
Hey now raise the bar, step into the light, turn the page
And all the dreams that we hold are written in the stars
Together we will go far
Hey now, you're a superstar, let your light shine and take the stage
Hey now, raise the bar, step into the light, turn the page
And all the dreams that we hold are written in the stars
