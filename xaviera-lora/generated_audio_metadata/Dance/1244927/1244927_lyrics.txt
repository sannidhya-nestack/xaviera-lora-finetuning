We said forever, but forever's come and gone
And now I'm left to wonder where did our love go wrong
I see your smile on strangers and it cuts like a knife
Reminding me of the memories we left behind
We're chasing the ghosts of our past
Trying to find what didn't last
We're searching for a love that will last
But it's hard to move on when the memories still last
I try to fill the silence with temporary highs
But they never last
And I'm left with tears in my eyes
I'm yearning for a love that's real, something that's true
But it's hard to find my way and I'm lost in what to do
We're chasing the ghosts of our past
Trying to find what didn't last
We're searching for a love that will last
But it's hard to move on when the memories still last
Maybe we can learn to let go and move on from the pain
Maybe we can find our way to love again
Maybe we can learn to ive and heal our hearts
And maybe we'll find our way to a brand new start
And we'll leave the ghosts of our past
And find a love that will truly last
We'll learn to love again and move on from the pain
And find a way to
