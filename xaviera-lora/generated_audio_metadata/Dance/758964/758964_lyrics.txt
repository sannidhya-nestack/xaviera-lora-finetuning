I'm watching you
You move like sworn tattoos down your neck
Sliding between cigarettes, Brooklyn lips
Manhattan sips, earthly angel low and fly
Shining in the dim light, and I can't help myself
And I want nothing else, my body said it's self in more
Well, I know, well, I know I'm no longer human
With a kiss you're waking up a machine
Overthrown by the hidden power of a woman
Don't believe in what you see
Everything is changing
Everything is changing
A queen, a drift
All faces lift
I see right through your disguise
Trap you in my diamond eyes
A mastermind
I know your design
Gonna transform you without a touch
You're mine, you're mine
And I can't help myself
And I want nothing else
My body's at itself in motion
Well I know, well I know I'm no longer human
With a kiss you're waking up a machine
Hold me down by the hip and pile up a woman
Don't believe in what you see
Everything is changing
Everything is changing
Taking me to my knees
Making it hard to breathe
I'm falling at your feet
Begging begging please
Well I know, well I know, I'm no longer human (no longer human)
With the kids you're waking up a machine (you're waking up a machine, yeah)
Overthrown by the hidden power of a woman (of a woman, yeah)
Don't believe in what you see
Everything is changing (Everything is changing)
Everything is changing (Everything is changing)
Everything is changing (Everything is changing)
Everything is changing (Don't believe what you say)
Don't believe what you say
