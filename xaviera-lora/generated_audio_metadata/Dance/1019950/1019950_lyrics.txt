Tell me lies, tell me lies, but don't hurt me
I see your eyes, it's no surprise, please don't hurt me
And if it's cold outside, I'm here if you're lonely
But if you're cold inside
Maybe you're not worth it
You'll be fine, you'll be fine
I found a message in a bottle saying
You'll be fine, you'll be fine
I said you'll be fine
Let me be clear
Touch is a move
And I'ma stay way back here
Let me be clear, I'ma stay way back here
Way back here
Let me be clear, touch is a move, and I'ma stay way back here
If you want another touch of my skin, hold my tongue
Still tryna figure out how to end this before I run
I never subscribed to this idea
Never did I promise poetry, I ain't on Shakespeare
If it's cold outside, I'm here if you're lonely
But if you're cold inside
Maybe you're not worth it, uh-huh
You'll be fine, you'll be fine
I found a message in a bottle saying
You'll be fine, you'll be fine
I said, "You'll be fine"
Let me be clear, touch is a move
And I'ma stay way back here (way back here)
(Way back here)
Let me be clear
(I'ma stay, I'ma stay)
I'ma stay way back here
(Way back here)
Way back here
(Way back)
Way back here
(Way back)
Let me be clear
Touch is a move
And I'ma stay way back here
(Way back here, way back here)
Let me be clear
(I'ma stay, I'ma stay)
I'ma stay way back here
Way back here (way back) way back here (way back)
Let me be clear, touch is a move and I'ma stay way back here
You'll be fine, you'll be fine
I found a message in a bottle saying you'll be fine
You'll be fine, I said you'll be fine
Let me be clear, touch is a move and i'ma stay way back here
Let me be clear, I'ma stay, I'ma stay, I'ma stay way back here
Way back, way back, let me be clear, touch is a move, I'ma stay way back here
I'ma stay, I'ma stay, way back here
I'ma stay, I'ma stay, way back here
I'ma stay, I'ma stay, way back here, way back here
