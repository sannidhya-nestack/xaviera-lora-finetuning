Day I look up to the blue
Laying next to me
I only think of you
Clouds rising while you pull me close
I think we're ready to go (follow me)
When now I know (follow me)
Follow me
The clouds (follow me)
Underneath the clouds
Hold me close to you, I'll pull you close to me
Come on baby, share my pillow
Hold me close to you, I'll pull you close to me
Hold me close to you, I'll pull you close to me
Come on baby, share my pillow
Hold me close to you, I'll pull you close to me
Under covers that stretch the skies
You're with me, I can always fly
Feel my heart beat so fast
Come share with me my pillow
Let's make this last
Let's make this last
Let's make this last
Hold me close to you, I'll pull you close to me
Pull me close to you, I'll pull you close to me (underneath)
Pull me close to you, I'll pull you close to me (underneath)
Pull me close to you, I'll pull you close to me
Hold me close to you, I'll pull you close to me
Underneath the clouds
Hold me close to you, I'll pull you close to me
