It's contagious
So many lovers just seem to get trapped in cages
With all that fussing and fighting they look so faceless
Come take a trip and leave them all behind as we break out from that mode
We can dance
But we don't lie
everyone's living it up, living it up, living it up right now
So can I get up?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Living it up, living it up, living it up right now
So can I get a
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's outrageous
They never really get to thinking about who pays us
Now all them people think that we should just act so gracious
Come take a trip and leave them all behind as we break out from that mold
We can dance but we don't lie
Cause it's everyone living it up, living it up, living it up right now
So can I get a oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Livin' it up, livin' it up, livin' it up right now
So can I get a
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I see them chasing their tails (chasing their tails)
Tapping their jails (yapping their jails)
Losing their dreams (losing their dreams)
Out on the streets (out on the streets)
Chasing their tails (chasing their tails)
Tapping their jails (yapping their jails)
Losing their dreams
But we won't join them now
Living it up, living it up, living it up right now
So can it get up right now?
Living it up, living it up, living it right now
So can it get up right now?
