I'm never around, not making no sound
Until I'm undercover
You're running around, making the sounds
Until you run for cover
You are perfect, make no mistake
You fight every word until you run
I don't think I'll have a word
To say that you make me dizzy, dizzy
You are my mystery, mm-mm, you
You are my mystery, oh, oh
You are perfect, make no mistake
You fight every word until you run
I don't think I'll have a word
To say you make me dizzy, dizzy, you
You are my mystery, mm-mm
You are my mystery, oh-oh
