Night's out, city bow
Feel the beat now here we go
Hearts racing, out of time
In the neon cosmic shine
Hands up, touch the sky
Make the moments fly on by
I see sparks in your eyes
Lost in this electric high
Let me show you how I feel
In the rhythm let's be real
Dancing through the night so bright
In this future called delight
Every pulse takes us higher
Feel the heat, it's burning fire
Heartbeat sings, we'll never tire
In this dream, we both conspire
Easy said, don't care what's around
Lost in love when you're found
Was in love when you heard the sound
All you started did just sound
Together we are bound
Let me show you how I feel
In the rhythm, let's be real
Dancing through the night so bright
In this future popped delight
Every pulse takes us higher
Feel the heat, it's burning fire
Heart beats, it will never tire
In this dream we both conspire
Voices echo, pure surround
Lost in love, we're never found
Understarlet digital sound
Together we are undone
Let me show you how I feel
In the rhythm let's be real
Dancing through the night so bright
In this future popped in life
Let me show you how I feel
In the rain, unless they're real
Dancing through the night so bright
In this future popped in life
It both comes fire
The future popped in line
