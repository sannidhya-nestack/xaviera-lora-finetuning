When midnight falls and the lights come alive
We're hitting the streets, yeah we're ready to drive
With a beat in my chest and you by my side
There's no stopping us now, let's enjoy the ride
I'm addicted to you, can't get enough
Every moment we share, it's the good stuff
With your smile so bright, and your head in mine
We're unstoppable, yeah we're one of a kind
In the fast lane, where the world is a blur
You're my go-to, my friend that's for sure
When we're out on the town, living life to the max
We're a dynamic duo, nothing we lack
I'm addicted to you, can't get enough
Every moment we share, it's the good stuff
With you smile so bright, and your hand in mine
We're unstoppable, yeah we're one of a kind
In the fast lane, where the world is a blur
You're my go-to, my vibe is for sure
When we're out on the town, living low, living life to the max
We're a dynamic duo, nothing we lack
I'm addicted to you, can't get enough
Every moment we share, it's the good stuff
With your smile so bright and your head in mine
We're unstoppable, yeah we're one of a kind
The music's bumpin' and we're feelin' the beat
We're lost in the rhythm, movin' our feet
In this crazy world, you're my favorite escape
Together we shine, yeah, we set the pace
I'm addicted to you, can't get enough
Every moment we share, it's the good stuff
With your smile so bright and your head in mine
We're unstoppable
Yeah, we're one of a kind
So let's keep it rolling
Things getting real tight
Through everything feels just right
I'm just alright
Breaking through
Forever and always
I'm addicted to you
So let's keep it rolling
Let's keep it real tight
With you everyday feels just right
In this wild ride
We'll break it through
Forever and always
I'm addicted to you
