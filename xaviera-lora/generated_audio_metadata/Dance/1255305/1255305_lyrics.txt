Woke up the morning with a brand new attitude
Just added it's time for a little gratitude
Got my favorite playlist volume up to ten
Ready to face the world here we go again
I'm done with all the drama, no more playing games
Today I choose to shine bright, watch me as I change
I'm walking on sunshine, got good vibes in my pocket
Nothing's gonna stop me now, I'm ready to rock it
Living in the moment, no looking back
This is my time to shine, I'm on the right track
Mirror tells me I'm looking fine today
Confidence is key that's what they all say
Got a spring in my step and a smile on my face
Taking on the world at my own pace
No room for negativity only good thoughts allowed
Spreading love and kindness standing tall and proud
I'm walking on sunshine
Got the vibes in my pocket
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'm ready to rock it
Living in the moment
No looking back
This is my time to shine
I'm on the right track
Every day's a new beginning, a chance to redefine
Who I am or where I'm going, it's my time to align
With all the dreams I'm chasing and the person I can be
Watch me as I bloom and grow into the best version of me
And walking on sunshine
Got good vibes in my pocket, nothing's gonna stop me now
I'm ready to rock it, living in the moment, no looking back
This is my time to shine, I'm on the right track
