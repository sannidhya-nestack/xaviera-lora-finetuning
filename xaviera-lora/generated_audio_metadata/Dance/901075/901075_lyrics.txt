She was the one who was always by my side
Stayed inside my heart we were so deep in love together
And I know that I was the one for her
Always meant to be with her, oh
But now she has gone away
My cheating was her of the pain
I'm trying to change my ways
'Cause she hates love and I know it's all on me
And I know it's all on me to make it right, get right
she hates love and I know it's all on me
And I know it's all on me to try and fight, and fight
My love, oh
Let me be your hero, my love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And I know I did it wrong but now let me tell you I'm sorry
You deserve so much more and now I promise I'm ready
If you let me near, I will dry your tears
We could be a second star of a world, girl
Oh please love me, I will never fight with you
I will never lie to you, you, you
I mean what I say, I'll do anything for you, you, you
Cause she hates love and I know it's all on me
And I know it's all on me to make it right, it right
Cause she hates love and I know it's all on me
And I know it's all on me to try and fight, and fight (yeah)
Let me be your hero
Let me be your hero
'Cause she hates love and I know it's all on me
And I know it's all on me to make it right, it right
she hates love and I know it's all on me
And I know it's all on me to try and fight, and fight
Cause she hates love and I know it's all on me
And I know it's all on me to make it right, get right
Cause she hates love and I know it's all on me
And I know it's all on me to try and fight, and fight
