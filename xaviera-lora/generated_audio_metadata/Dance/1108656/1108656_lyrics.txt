Baby, baby, the sight of you is making me sway
I never thought I'd see the sun passing my way
Your heat's burning me up like the blue of the sky
I almost think it's impossible you're flying so high
You look super fly, it's surely gonna make my day, uh-huh
You're super natural, like a bee attached, you're ballin' my way
You look super fly, it's surely gonna make my day, uh-huh
You're supernatural, I could be attached to you, but I'm over my way
Over my, I'm over my way
Over my, over my
Over my, I'm over my way
Over my
Over my, over my, over my way
I wonder what's wrong with me for standing away
Could it ever be possible for you and me?
Like the light of the sun you take me away
I wanna be lovin' you, I beg to stay
You look super fly, ain't sure they're gonna make my day, uh-huh
You're supernatural, they'll be attached, but they're moving my way
You look super fly, ain't sure it gonna make my day, uh-huh
Supernatural, could be a touchable and move my way
Move my, move my way
Move my, move my
Move my, move my way
Move my
Move my, move my, move my way
Move my way
Move my way
Move my way
Move my, move my way
Move my, move my, move my, move my way
Move my, move my, move my way
You look super fly and sure gonna make my day, uh huh
Supernatural, could be touchable and move my way
You look super fly and short it's gonna make my day, uh-huh
Supernatural, I could be attachable and move my way
Move my, move my way
Move my, move my
Move my, move my way
Move my
Move my, move my, move my way
Move my, move my, move my, move my way
Move my, move my, move my, move my way
Move my, move my, move my, move My way
Move my, move my, move my, move my way
