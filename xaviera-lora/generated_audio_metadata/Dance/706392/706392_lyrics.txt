(Silence down)
(Silence down)
Silence slips into my wall
And it follows into my dreams
Moonbeams flicker across my room
And in the twilight, your thoughts will be broken
And when the sun goes down
The shadows cast on this town
And when the sun goes down
The night
And when the sun goes down, a shadow is cast on this town
And when the sun goes down, the night breaks away
The sun goes down
The sun goes down
Your dreams
Echo my mind's eye
In the daylight
Painting the sky
Sun comes
Crossing the water
We're breathing sunlight
And resting our eyes
And when the sun goes down
The shadow is cast on this town
And when the sun goes down
The night breaks free
And when the sun goes down
The shadow is cast on this town
And when the sun goes down
The night breaks free
