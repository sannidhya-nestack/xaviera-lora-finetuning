We were shadows in the static
Chasing sparks in the dark
Every street light felt cinematic
Every step lit a mark
We were louder than the silence
We were sharper than the rain
Every laugh a kind of science
Every glance a hurricane
Didn't know where we were going
Only knew what we could do
All the pieces started showing (showing)
Coming into view
So sing it out all the way through
Love like it's endless, wild and true
We're wide awake, we've got nothing to lose
Hold me close and we'll make it through
All the way through, all the way through
We were dancing on the pavement, making time disappear
Every word became a statement, only you I could hear
We were building something brighter
Out of silver, out of blue
Every stumble pulled us tighter
Till the world was brand new
Didn't know where we were going
Only knew what we could do
All the pieces started showing
Coming into view
So sing it out all the way through
Love like it's endless, wild and true
We're wide awake, we've got nothing to lose
Hold me close and we'll make it through
All the way through, all the way through
No map, no plan, just a hand in mine
Every wrong road still feels right in time
Every moment's gold when it's me and you
We're not just surviving, we're shining through
So sing it out all the way through
Love like it's endless, wild and true
We're wide awake, we've got nothing to lose
Hold me close and we'll make it through
All the way through
All the way through
All the way through
Every step is vital
When it's me and you
