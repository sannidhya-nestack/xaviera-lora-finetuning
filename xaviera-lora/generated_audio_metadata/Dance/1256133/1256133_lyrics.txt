Stuck into the glow
Lost in the show
The reality's fading
Dead dreams creating
Eyes wide shut
Never wake up
In this delulu
All that I knew
Doolooloo eh-oh
Our time to fly (fly)
High above the world, let's touch the sky (sky)
In our own just where we belong (belong)
Doolooloo eh-oh
Don't wake up strong (wake up strong)
We'll whisper in the night
Stars shining bright in fantasies
We trust glitter and stardust
World of make believe
Heart of my city
Living surreal
That's how we feel
The Lulu air
Our time to fly
High above the world, touch the sky (sky)
And the moon shines where we belong (belong)
Blue, blue air, don't wake up strong
To-loo-loo air, our time to fly
High above the world, let's touch the sky
In the oceans where we belong
To-loo-loo air, don't wake up strong
Whisper in the night, stars shining bright
In fantasies we trust, glitter and stardust
World of make believe, hard on my sleeve
Living surreal, that's how we feel
Don't lose no air, our time to fight
High above the world, let's touch the sky
In the oceans where we belong
Don't lose no air, don't wake up strong
