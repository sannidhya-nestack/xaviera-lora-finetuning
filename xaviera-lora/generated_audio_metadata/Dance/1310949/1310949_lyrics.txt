Do you know what love is, yeah?
I don't think you do, think you do
Your love is torture
I was fine'til I fell in love with you
Baby, I don't trust you, you should move on
Dropping moves, I'll bounce like a slow song
You think that I'm trippin', but you're so wrong, so wrong, yeah
Love is a dirty word (such a dirty word)
Love is a dirty word (yeah, ooh, now)
Such a dirty word
Love is a love is a dirty word
Your body's rocking
Got me feeling it feeling it
Left me in the morning
But I can't seem to quit it
Got you on my mind now
All I wanna do is focus
Told me that you love me
Say no more gotta show me
Baby I don't trust you, you should move on
Dropping moves, your bombs like a snow storm
You think that I'm tripping but you're so wrong, so wrong, ayy
Love is a dirty word (such a dirty word)
Love is a dirty word (yeah, ooh, now)
Such a dirty word
Love is a dirty word
Now I said that four letter word
Hoping one day you don't kick me to the curb
Took me so long to break down my fence
Such a dirty word, you're so full of shoe
That 90's love, it was so much better
Better love me right boy, find somebody that'll love me better
That 90's love, it was so much better
Better love me right boy
Find somebody that'll love me back
Love is a dirty word
Love is a dirty word
Such a dirty word
Love is a dirty word
