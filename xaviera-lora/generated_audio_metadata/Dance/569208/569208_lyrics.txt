Hold on
How long can I wait for you?
Oh
This is the love
This is the love
There's a space where my heart has been
You and me forever walking
Hold on
Hold on

This is love
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
This is love
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-la
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ooh, girl, this is love
Girl, hold on
There's a space where my heart has been
You and me forever walking
Girl
This is love, girl
This is love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love
