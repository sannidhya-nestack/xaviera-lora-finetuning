Them being like, what's wrong? You turned off your phone
Say what you wanna say then play all your stupid games
Baby there's no one to blame just give your love to someone new
Just move move on just move move on
Just one more phone
Just one more phone
Just one more phone
Just one more phone
Just one more phone
Just one more phone
Say what you wanna say
Play all your stupid games
No one to blame
Maybe all I wanted to be on my own
Tears fall down, can't answer your call
Someone new, someone new
Someone new, someone new
Just one more boy, just one more boy
Just one more boy, just one more boy
Just one more boy, just one more boy
Just move on
Just move on
