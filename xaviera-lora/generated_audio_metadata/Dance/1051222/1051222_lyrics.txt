You treat me so bad, oh
You treat me so bad, oh
You treat me so bad, oh
To the highest ground
You'd see me super, oh
You'd see me super, oh
You'd see me super, oh
To the highest ground
It's my heart hanging on a thread
Begging for iveness
For something I had said
That offended you
Every foot that he read my feet
The power of my transgression
Told her I couldn't see you to laugh to me
You'd see me so far, oh
You'd see me so far, oh
You'd see me so far, oh
To the highest ground
You take me so far, oh
You take me so far, oh
You take me so far, oh
To the highest ground
Kept my heart hanging on a thread
Begging for iveness for something I had said
That offended you
Every foot and here at my feet
That followed my progression
So glad I couldn't see
You to lie to me
You'd see me so far, oh
You'd see me so far, oh
You'd see me so far, oh
Into the highest ground
You take me so far, oh
You take me so far, oh
You take me so far, oh
Into the highest ground
You take me so far, oh
You take me so far, oh
You take me so far, oh
To the highest ground
You'd see me super, oh
You'd see me super, oh
You'd see me super, oh
To the highest ground
