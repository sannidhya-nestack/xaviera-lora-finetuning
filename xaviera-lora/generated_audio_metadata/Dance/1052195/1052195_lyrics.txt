You tell me you're not ready to love again even though you adore me
So would you just use me, abuse me
I guess I let my own self down
Thinking that you'd come around
I got better things to do
You won't catch me feeling blue not over you
You
Tell me how it's true
Oh, will you turn your back and let me fall?
I'll rise above it all
Stay in the strong and tall
Oh, will you turn your back and let me fall?
I'll rise above it all
Stayin' strong and tall (Stayin' strong and tall) (Stayin' strong and tall)
