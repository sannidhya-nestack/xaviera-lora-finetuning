See no evil, hear no evil
Thank you all you perfect people
Fear's the only way that I can get inside your shallow minds
Genes that bind and genes that rip
I feel my soul, I start to slip inside this bloody hell
In which I find my little bloody pill
I, I wanna feel your eyes
I want to feel you, love me like a mad man, blow me like a bomb
Never gonna let me go, the lust of my desire
There's no word that mortals fear
Sins of lust, a painful tear
Being the victim which I feed
Souls are burning, plant my seed
You took my breath away
You took it and you killed it and you left it that way
You never have to treasure it but I would spill the pain
It doesn't even matter when you're dying day by day
Cause I, I wanna feel your heart
I wanna feel you moving like a mad man burning like a fire
Never gonna let me go the rest of my desire
You got my breath away (I wanna feel your)
You got my breath away (I wanna feel you moving like a mad man burning like fire)
Tell me you don't let me go the rest of my desire
Hear no evil see no evil
Hear no evil see no evil
Hear no evil see no evil
