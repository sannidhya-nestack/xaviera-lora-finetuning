It's right, leave us all behind
It's right, leave us all
Behind
I'm going out of my mind
Wake me up when I can't go out and stand
I spent so long here
I don't know if I can see the light
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna be free
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna be free
It's right, leave us all behind
It's right, leave us all behind
It's brave leave this all behind
It's brave leave this all behind
