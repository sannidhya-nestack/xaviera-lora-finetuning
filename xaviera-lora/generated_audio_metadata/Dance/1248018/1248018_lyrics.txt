Underneath the cherry trees where petals fall
Softly whispering secrets of it all
In the springtime breeze where the magic lies
Cherry blossom kisses under open skies
Cherry blossom kisses in the night
Soft as a whisper, sweet as a lie
In the glow of moonlit dreams
Cherry blossom kisses it seems
Walking down the paths where the blossoms sway
Hand in hand together in the sweet ballet
Every kiss a promise, every touch a sigh
Cherry blossom kisses make me feel alive
Cherry blossom kisses in the night
Soft as a whisper, sweet as a lie
In the glow of moonlit dreams
Cherry blossom kisses it seems
Stars above are shining in the twilight hue
Painting us in colors that feel so true
In the gardens a whisper where the heartache dies
Cherry blossom kisses underneath the skies
Cherry blossom kisses in the night
Soft as a whisper, sweet as a lie
In the glow of moonlit dreams
Cherry blossom kisses it seems
As the dawn is breaking and the night moves on
Memories of kisses linger though you're gone
In the quiet morning where the love still lies
Cherry blossom kisses light up the sky
Cherry blossom kisses in the night
Soft as a whisper, sweet as a lie
In the glow of moonlit dreams
Cherry blossom kisses it seems
Cherry blossom kisses fade away
In my heart forever they will stay
In the echoes of our bliss
Cherry blossom kisses I miss
