Huh?
The way you work that floor
The way you do it raw
Don't need no fakes, yeah
Don't need no make up
You lookin' kinda tasty, girl
You are my creme brulee
I wanna eat you up and chase you with some bubbly
You got my stomach rumblin', brain fumblin' for the words
I'm London Bridge fallin' hard, you are my London Bird
I love that accent
You love my f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f
I'll be your tugboat, I wanna row, row, row
I'll tug you merrily, merrily, merrily down the stream, stream
you're the sweetest thing these eyes have ever seen, seen
Known from the start, boy, that you stole my heart
This is what I gotta do, I just wanna rock with you
Wanna blow the whole spot, shake them bottles, make them pop
Take this lil show on the road, watch them women ram the globe
Fall in love with my flow, when I do this thing I do
She's classy, no tramp, she's got that genies lamp
I love it, whip it out, I rub it, things come out
She's like my teeny eeny genie, grantin' all my wishes
She's the sweetest thing I've tasted since Swedish fishes
She ain't pitbull vicious
She's all hugs and kisses
I send her XOXOXOTUI bitches
Call me superman
I'm diving undercover
Ain't got no rings of purity
I ain't no Jonas brother
Know from the stars boy that you stole my heart
This is what I gotta do, I just wanna rock with you
While I blow the whole spot, shake them bottles make them pop
Take this whole show on the road, watch them women round the globe
Fall in love with my flow, when I do this thing I do
This is what I gotta do, I just wanna rock with you
While I blow the whole spot, shake them bottles make them pop
Take this whole show on the road
Watch them women'round the globe
Fall in love with my flow
When I do this thing I do it for you, son of a gun
I'll do what you love
I'm wild Janice Joplin
Oh child don't you stop it
Floorboards creaking
Shore more freakin'
Four shores screamin'
Fiendin', focus, can't you breathin'?
BP, your oil's leakin'
This is what I gotta do, I just wanna rock with you
While I blow the whole spot, shake them bottles make them pop
Take this whole show on the road, watch them women round the globe
Fall in love with my flow, when I do this thing I do
This is what I gotta do, I just wanna rock with you
While I blow the whole spot, shake them bottles make them pop
Take this whole show on the road, watch them women round the globe
Fall in love with my flow
When I do this thing I do
