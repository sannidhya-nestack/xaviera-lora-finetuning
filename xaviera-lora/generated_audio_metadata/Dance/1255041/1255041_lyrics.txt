Waves are calling, feel the breeze
Chasing moments, wild and free
Take the dive, let's make the scene
In this world where we're evergreen
Jump right in, let's break the mold
Every story has to hold
Ride the tide, embrace the thrill
In this flow, we find our will
Make a splash, let's paint the bed
With every drop, we pave our way
In the rush, we find our grace
Every leap, a bold embrace
Stepping stones on waters blue
Every ripple starts anew
Sun kissed smiles and laughter loud
In this wave we'll stand unbound
Jump right in, let's break the mold
Every story has to hold
Ride the tide, embrace the thrill
In this flow, we'll find our will
Make a splash, let's paint the day
With every drop, we pave our way
In the rush, we find our grace
Every leap, a modern grace
For the currents we will glide
Side by side, we'll never hide
Every challenge face it strong
In this journey we belong
Make a splash, let's paint the day
With every drop we pave our way
In the rush we find our grace
Every leap a golden grace
Waves will rise and winds may blow
Hand in hand our spirits grow
Make a splash, let's leave our mark
In this world, we're like a spark
