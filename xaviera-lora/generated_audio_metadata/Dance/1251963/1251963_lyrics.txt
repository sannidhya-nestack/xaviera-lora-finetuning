City lights, flash, cars racing fast
Another club, another glass
Lipsticks, much hair, a mess
Tonight we're chasing happiness
Think the beat it's in my veins
No time for sorrow or for pain
This rhythm's got me hypnotized
Let's lose ourselves and close our eyes
I'm electric, can't you see?
Sparks fly when you look at me
Dance floor's hot, we're burning bright
Let's keep this party going all night, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm electric, baby
Hands in the air, sweat on my skin
Don't know where I end, where you begin
DJ spinning our favorite song
In this moment we belong
Feel the beatings in my veins
No time for struggle or for pain
This rhythm's got me hypnotized
Let's lose ourselves and close our eyes
I'm electric, can't you see?
Spawns dark when you look at me
Dance floor's hot, we're burning bright
Let's keep this party going all night
Oh oh oh oh
I'm electric baby
When the world outside is cold and grey
We'll make our own sun, light up the day
Nothing can stop us, we're on fire
Reaching higher, higher, higher
I'm electric, can't you see?
Sparks fly when you look at me
Dance floor's hot, we're burning bright
Let's keep this party going all night
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm electric baby
