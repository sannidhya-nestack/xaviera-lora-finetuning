I'm supersonic, when I move to the beat
I'm getting on it, burning up with the heat
So electronic, music is a release
And we'll dance to the morning light
When I hear it I just lose control
It's ticking over and I feel I'm ten feet tall
Can you see that I'm in overdrive
Music makes your heart ignite
No slow motion you can't stop me now
Intoxicated by the rhythm of that sound
Like the fusion of the dynamite
Music it will blow your mind
I'm supersonic when I move to the beat
I'm getting on it running up with the heat
So electronic music is the release
And I'm beating like I could fly
Raise the volume and the room explodes
Keep on going far beyond that twilight zone
Change the tempo to an all time high
Catch me at the speed of light (Like a flight) I'm supersonic
When I move to the beat
I'm getting on it
Riding up with the heat
So electronic
Music is a release
And I'm beating like I could fly
I'm supersonic (supersonic)
I'm getting on it (getting on it)
I'm getting on it, so electronic (electronic, yeah)
And we'll dance'til the morning light (morning light)
I'm supersonic (supersonic)
I'm getting on it (getting on it)
So electronic (ooh)
And I beat it like I could fly
Super Sonic
Get it on in
Yeah baby
Music is the release baby
Super Sonic
Baby yeah yeah
Oh yeah
It will blow your mind
I'm supersonic
When I move to the beat
I'm getting on it
Riding up with the heat
So electronic
Music is a release
And we'll dance to the morning light
I'm supersonic
Snapping up to the groove
I'm getting on it
Making all the right moves
So electronic
Music's pushing me through
Beating like a good fly
