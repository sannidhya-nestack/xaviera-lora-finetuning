It's an easy song
Under the guitar
I saw the ballad under the stars
City dizzy song
It changed your life
I recognize it by spots in your eyes
Stayin' here with me
All I wanted for
Stayin' here for me
Stayin' here'bout your love
Stayin' here with me
I want it more and more
Stayin' here for me
What I need
Sing the easy song
Under the guitar
A song about us under the stars
Sing the magic song
Looking at you
Do you see these words in my eyes
Sing it with me
All I want it for
Sing it for me
Sing about your love
Sing it with me
I want it more and more
Sing it for me
But I'm in
