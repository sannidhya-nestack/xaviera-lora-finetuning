Better run, better run, better run
Better run, better run
Devastating earthquake
I can make the floor shake
Split level pipers
Wall to wall waterworks
Crunch up steel burst of flame
Plaster shower crystal rain
Hardware glassware
Everything you see
Get down now
The worthless things around you
Na na na na na na na
Come on now
It's all about to change
I am a demon, I'm a dream cut down
A nightmare from the underground
Now the things I touch are easily crushed
Better run, better run, I'm dangerous
Better run, better run, better run
Better run, better run, huh
Ruse-butt blood blooms all over the bathroom
Copper guts and water mains open up their cool lanes
Wear a chandelier crown, all your treasures trashed now
Busted mirrors, everything you see, get down now (get down now)
The worthless things around you (nah nah nah nah nah nah nah)
Come on now (come on now)
It's all about to change (show, not show)
(Touch, touch)
I am a demon, I'm a dream cut down
A nightmare from the underground
Now the things I touch are easily crushed
Better run, better run, I'm dangerous
When it stops, I can see
Silent graveyards of debris
Wooden bones, broken homes
Fractured city scenery
Better run, better run, better run
Better run, better run, better run
