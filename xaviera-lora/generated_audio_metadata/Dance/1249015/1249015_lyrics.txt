Met you on a summer night, underneath the starlit skies
Your smile it shone so bright like a thousand fireflies
We whispered secrets in the dark
Hearts racing beating fast
Fell in love with just one spark
Hoping that this night will last
Oh midnight fireflies
Lighten up our dreams our lives
Dancing in the moonlit breeze
Catching moments we can't free
Hold me close
Don't let go
In the glow of love we know
Midnight fireflies you and I
Chasing stars across the sky
Talked about our wildest dreams
The places we would someday go
Our laughter echoed in the streams
Of every word we let it flow
The world was ours, just you and me
No worries, no goodbyes
In the magic we were free
Living in our firefly light
Oh, midnight firefly
Lighting up our dreams online
Dancing in the moonlit breeze
Catching moments we can't free
Hold me close, don't let go
In the glow of love we know
Midnight fireflies, you and I
Chasing stars across the sky
Oh, oh, oh
Midnight firefly
Oh, love never dies
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Now autumn leaves are falling down
But memories keep us warm
We'll always have that night in town
When fireflies became our norm
But seasons change and time goes by
And summer stays in our heart
In dreams we still chase fireflies
Together never apart
Oh midnight firefly
Lighting up our dreams online
Dancing in the moonlit breeze
Catching moments we can't free
Hold me close, don't let go
In the glow of love we know
Midnight fireflies you and I
Chasing stars across the sky
Oh, oh, oh
Midnight firefly
Oh, oh, oh
Love never dies
Midnight fireflies you and I
Mandai Fireflies, you and I
