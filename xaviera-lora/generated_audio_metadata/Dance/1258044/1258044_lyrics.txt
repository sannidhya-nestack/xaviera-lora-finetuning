Living in the rhythm of city lights
Chasing all the dreams in our crazy lives
Riding on a wave under the moon's glow
Tonight it feels right, this is our stage show
Got our hearts on fire, running wild and free
In this magic moment, just you and me
Living for the beat, in this neon sea
Share this dance with me, lose yourself in three, two, one
Dance with me, under the moonlight
Shake it loose, let's ignite the starlight
Live your dreams on this rhythm fly
Nothing compares to this night, just hold on tight
Horses are racing, feeling burned so bright
In the rhythms, waves, our souls ignite
Electric connection in this galaxy
When the night's calling, it's our symphony
Music's our language, bodies intertwined
Caught up in the magic, time is redefined
With every heartbeat, our colors shine
Tonight's the time, in three, two, one
Ten
Dance with me, under the moonlight
Shake it loose, let's ignite the starlight
Live your dreams on this rhythm flight
Nothing compares to this night, just hold on tight
Side by side with the rhythm we ride
To the break of dawn
