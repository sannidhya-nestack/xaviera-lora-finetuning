Oh, oh, oh, oh
Once the battle time
Feel the rhythm flow
In the moonlight shine
Let's take it slow
Let's go slow, feel the breeze blow
Heart's beating fine, let's do slow
Oh, oh, oh
No need to rush, under stars we grow
In this gentle hush
Love's melody we sew
Ooh
Let's go slow
Feel the breeze blow
Heart's beating it's high
Let's go slow
Feel the night
Look like there's nothing left to show
Ooh
In the shadow hearts will find our glow
Let's go slow
Feel the breeze though
Hearts beating in time
Let's go slow
Let's go slow, feel the breeze blow
Heart's beating in time, let's go slow
