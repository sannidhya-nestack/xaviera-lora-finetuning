I feel good, good, good, good, good, good
I feel good, good, good, good, good, good
Lights flash, the beat drops
Let's make this night ours
Rhythm takes control
Every move empowers
Lose yourself in the groove
Leave your worries behind
Let the music move your soul
Let the rhythm unwind
We're alive
We're electric, we're on fire tonight
Let's dance like there's no tomorrow, shine ever so bright
Feel the energy surging, let your body sway
This is our moment, let's make it stay
Sweat glistens, heart's racing, a magnetic force
Strangers become family on this dance floor course
Inhibitions fade away as the baseline rumbles
Let the melodies embrace you, let the rhythm crumble
We're alive, we're the electric girl on fire tonight
Let's dance like there's no tomorrow, shine ever so bright
Feel the energy surging, let your body sway
This is our moment, let's make it stay
The world fades away, it's just you and me
Lost in the euphoria of this melody
Tonight we're invisible, nothing can stop us
Let's make memories that will forever rock us
We're alive, we're electric, now I'm fired tonight
Let's dance like there's no tomorrow, shine ever so bright
Feel the energy surge and let your body sway
This is our moment, let's make it stand
The world fades away, it's just you and me
Lost in the euphoria of this melody
Tonight we're invincible, nothing can stop us
Let's make memories that will forever rock us
We're alive, we're electric, we're on fire tonight
Let's dance like there's no tomorrow, shine ever so bright
Feel the energy surging, let your body sway
This is our moment, let's make it stay
