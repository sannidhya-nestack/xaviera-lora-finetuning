One sunny day, we packed our bags and went away
To an end so far, chalo chalin, oh chalo chalin
A paradise where we could play from the moment I set foot on that golden sand
Chalo chalin, oh chalo chalin
I knew this vacation was about to be grand
Quiet shit, keep me feeling your head
Through the crowded streets
I saw your smiling face
Feeling like a dream
Ahopa, aja opas
A love we couldn't erase
Our eyes met and our hearts started to race
Ahopa, aja opas
In that magical moment
Time and space erased
Quiet shit, keep me feeling your head
Oh, summer beach with the waves as our sound
Underneath the stars, oh, pierre qui tourne à l'air
We found our melody, love's our harmony, oh yeah
We found a melody, love's the harmony
Au-pien qui tourne à rien, yeah, yeah
Dancing on the beach with the waves as I sound
Underneath the stars
Au-pien qui tourne à rien, yeah, yeah
We found a melody, love's the harmony
Oh yeah
Au-pien the melody
Love's a harmony, oh yeah
Gotta keep them yeah, yeah
Gotta keep them yeah, yeah
