In the lights where the bass drops down to the floor
Feel the beat, hear the sound where the night takes all control
Dance with no intention, just lose it, let it go
Find that sweet redemption in the music's endless flow
When the lights start to blind, feel the love electrify
In this space, cross the line, feel the power unify
When the lights start to blind, feel the love electrify
In this space, cross the line, feel the power unify
I'm not sure I'm not sure
