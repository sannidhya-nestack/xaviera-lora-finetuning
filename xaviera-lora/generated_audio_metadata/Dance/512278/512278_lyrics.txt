We're making it move, we're making it hot, we're giving it high
We're rocking the house, owning this porch, just making it fly
We're getting it going alright, you gotta get moving tonight
Let's turn this place inside out
We're letting you bump, we're letting you jump, we're getting you high
We're doing the job to glide and it rips, so give it a try
You gotta get out of your head, so groovin' and body and legs
And turn this place inside out
Show me your moves, you're making me dance
Make me dance baby
You're making me dance dance dance dance dance
Dance that ass
Woah oh
Come on and dance with me
You're making me dance dance dance dance dance
Dance that ass
Jump up and down
Woah oh
You're making me dance dance dance dance dance
Dance that ass
You're making me dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
We're making you sweat, we're making you shake, we're putting you out
You're doing the moves, you're giving the grooves
You're rocking no doubt
You ladies are ready to play
You guys keep moving this way
Let's turn this place inside out
You're feeling it yet, you're feeling okay, you're feeling the crowd
Keep bombing the bass, beating your face, just take it, it's now
The band is making you rock, and DJ is taking the spot
My center stays inside out
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hey, you're making me dizzy
Jump up and down
Da da da da da da da
Alright everybody
Are you ready to dance?
I said are you ready to dance?
Alright this is an emergency
All the up women take off your clothes and dance
Hey you're making me dance dance dance dance dance dance
Dance dance dance
Oh oh
Dance come on
You're making me dance dance dance dance dance
Dance dance dance
I wanna see you dance
Oh oh oh
You're making me dance dance dance dance dance
Dance dance dance
You call that dancing?
Oh oh
You're making me dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, oh
