Ever since I ran into you
You've been running through my head leaving tracks too
It's almost like I'm in need of some food
Though I seem overfed with the thought of you
But it's never gonna stop until I've had a bite of your love
Never gonna stop, never gonna stop, stop
I'm gonna get it sometime and get it off my mind
Never gonna stop, never gonna stop, stop
It should be so good and right
No it's never gonna stop until I've had a bite of your love (Never gonna stop, never gonna stop)
I wanna bite (bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite)
I wanna bite (bite, bite, bite)
I wanna bite (bite, bite, bite), I wanna bite
You're in my thoughts like the sugar in sweets
Gonna ruin my teeth if you want me to
I've had enough of this lonely fantasy
Though it makes me realize where I want to be
But it's never gonna stop until I've had a bite of your love
I'm gonna get it sometime and get it off my mind (never gonna stop, never gonna stop)
It should be so good and right
No, it's never gonna stop until I've had a bite of your love (never gonna stop, never gonna stop)
I wanna bite
I wanna bite (I wanna bite)
I wanna bite (I wanna bite)
I wanna bite
I'm never gonna stop
I'm never gonna stop baby
But it's never gonna stop until I've had a bite of your love (never gonna stop, never gonna stop, stop)
I'm gonna get it sometime and get it off my mind (never gonna stop, never gonna stop, stop)
It should be so good and right
No, it's never gonna stop until I've had a bite of your love (Never gonna stop, never gonna stop)
I wanna bite (I wanna bite)
I wanna bite (I wanna bite)
I wanna bite (I wanna bite)
I wanna bite
