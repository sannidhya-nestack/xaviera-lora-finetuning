I don't understand what you're saying
Your eyes talk to me, light up the dark
Words fall silent, heartbeats play loud
In the quiet, love's in the crowd
I speak truth, no need to talk
We walk the night in our eyes' light
Silent whispers between our souls
I shimmer bright in moons and rays
Gaze into mine
Stars align
Feel the fire
Through our desire
I speak truth
No need to talk
We walk the night
In our eyes light
