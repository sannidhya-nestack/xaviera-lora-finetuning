Dancing in the spotlight, feeling kinda shy
Stumblin' on the dance floor but I still try
You laugh and take my hand, guiding me along
To the left feet, we find our own song
To the left feet, we find our own song
To the left feet, but we keep movin'
Tu pie' di sinistri ma continuamo' a ballare
In this rhythm, we are provin'
Nella musica il cuore vuole restare
Underneath the disco lights we find our groove
Every little misstep makes us feel so smooth
You smile and I know everything's alright
Too luffy, we dance through the night
Too luffy, we dance through the night
Too luffy, but we keep moving
Tu piedi sinistri ma continuiamo a ballare
In this rhythm we are moving
Nella musica il cuore vuole stare
Even when the music stops we carry on
In the silence of the night our love is strong
You and me together we can't go wrong
We're two left feet we belong
To left feet, we belong
To left feet, oh we keep moving
Tu pie di sinistri, ma continuamo a ballare
In this rhythm, we are proven
Nella musica il cuore vuole stare
With two left feet we find our way
Con due piedi sinistri troviamo la via
Dancing together come what may
Balliamo insieme notte e di
