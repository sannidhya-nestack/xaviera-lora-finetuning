The lightning in the distant skies are turning gray
Dark thunder rolling in it's gonna make us all weep
Feel the tension rising in the air tonight
In the storm we're dancing under flashing lights
Dark thunder here we roll
Shaking ground to the core
In the night we'll come alive
Dark thunder feel the vibe
Winds are howling louder as the rain pours down
In the chaos we find rhythm spinning all around
Electric in the atmosphere, sparks against fire
Dark thunder in our hearts, reaching for the sky
Dark thunder, here it roars, shaking ground to the core
In the night will come a light, dark thunder feel the vibe
Feel the vibe
Through the storm we're moving shadows in the night
Every beat is pounding filling us with light
In the eye of the tempest we are standing tall
Dark thunder is power echoing in our soul
So thunder hear our roar hear it roar
Shaking down to the core
In the night we'll come alive
Just try not to feel the vibe
Thunderstorm, we're moving shadows in the night
Everything is coming, filling us with light
In the eye of the tempest, we are standing tall
Dark thunderous power echoing in us all
Dark Thunder Hero, ooh
Dark Thunder Hero
Shaking ground to the core
In the night we'll come alive
Dark Thunder feel the vibe
As the stormy candles still fade
Dark Thunder leaves its shade
In our hearts the echoes stay
Dark Thunder leaves the way
