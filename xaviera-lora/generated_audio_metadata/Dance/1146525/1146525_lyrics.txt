Move my, move my, move my, move my way
Move my, move my, move my, move my way
Superfly, superfly, supernatural
Baby, baby inside of you is making me sway
I never thought I'd see the sun passing my way
Your heat's burning me up like the blue of the sky, uh-huh-huh
I almost think it's impossible, you're flying so high
You look super fly, it's surely gonna make my day, uh-huh-huh
You're supernatural, like a bird, touchable and moving my way
'Cause you look super fly and it's surely gonna make my day, uh-huh
You're supernatural, like a bitch that you're'bout to move my way
Move my, move my way
Move my, move my
Move my, move my way
Move my
Over my, over my, over my way
I wonder what's wrong with me for standing all the way
Or could it ever be possible for you and me
Like the light of the sun you take me away
I wanna be lovin' you, I'm beggin' to stay
You look super fly, ain't sure that gonna make my day, uh-huh
Supernatural, a little bit touchable, move my way
You look super fly, ain't sure that gonna make my day, uh-huh
Supernatural, flippin' touchable, move my way
Supernatural, move my way
Move my, move my, move my way
Move my, move my way
Move my, move my, move my, move my way
Move my, move my way
Move my
Moving my, moving my, moving my way
Moving my, moving my, moving my, moving my way
Moving my, moving my, moving my, moving my way
Moving my, moving my, moving my, moving My way
