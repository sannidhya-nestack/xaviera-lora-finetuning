Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
If you were a book, I'd turn every page
Trace every line, let your story engage
I'd dive in deep where your secrets reside
In the heart of your chapters where memories hide
I'd write a song of your pages worn in the margins
Where dreams are born
A melody of whispers through time's gentle look
If you were a story
If you were a book
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'd linger on words
That speak to my soul
In your sentences
I find my role
Your cover worn
But your spirit so bright
In the silence of night
I read you by light
I write a song
Of your pages worn in the margins
Where dreams are born
A melody of whispers to touch and talk
If you were a story
If you were a book
Every dogged corner
Every distinct place
I'd see you returning in every space
In your wake
I'd find my way back home
Through every story, I'll never be alone, alone
Let me hold you in my hands so tight
In the library of my heart, you are the light
In every chapter I find my hook
If you were a story, if you were a book
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, so let me hold you
In my hands so tight
In the library of my heart you are the light
In every chapter
I will find my hope
If you were a story
If you were a book
