Meu silenzio d'avenida
Your voice echoes in my mind
Ti procuro na saída
Lost in the night I try to find
Teu jeito levi mi leva
Through the lights I feel you near
Mio segreto si revela
I'm not afraid when you're here
Vem comigoo
Just let it flow
Sigo o mundo slow, so slow
Vem comigoo
Don't let me go
We've got all night to grow
Tua sombra me acompaña
Every street I walk alone
Meu caminho ganha cor
When I feel your heart with my song
Teu jeito leva e me levant
Through the lights I feel you near
Meu segredo se revela
I'm not afraid when you're here
Vem comigo
Just let it flow
Sinto o mundo dos lows
Vem comigo
Don't let me go
We got a light to grow
Mesmo cuando todo cala
Hear the rhythm in the dark
Te oigo a mi embala
You're the spark inside my heart
Ten conmigo
Just let it flow
Siento el mundo slow, too low
Ten conmigo
Don't let me go
We got all night, let me grow
Fem-pu-mi-pu
Oh oh
Just let it flow
