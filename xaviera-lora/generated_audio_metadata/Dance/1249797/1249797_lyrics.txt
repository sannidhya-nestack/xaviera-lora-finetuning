There's a message I can't choose, I'm down with you, tell me something
Just try to come closer
I don't wanna say or do the things you do, not ever
I've tried it in my life
Count my blessings all the same, that's all I can do
I just can't control what's over you
There's a lesson all the time, it's on my mind
I'm setting my attention over you
I don't wanna hide, I'm right here by your side
And I can't take you higher, let's do this right
There's no reason why you can't deny me twice
Don't wanna run away, I want you to know
I just wanna say that I'm living my life
You turn around and seem to know it's true
There's one thing I can say, I am doing it right
That's how I'm gonna bring it to you
Like a butterfly, I can take you high
I can tell you there's no question I can't even try
There's no reason why
I can make you mine
I keep on guessing life without you
We can do this right
I can satisfy
I don't waste no time
You got attention all around you
It's not hard to find
If you don't know why
I can't turn back time
Can't deny I'm glad I found you
You're always in my mind
You're always in my mind
I don't wanna walk away I'm here to stay
There's a meaning
My world's getting colder
I can turn around and dance away the pain
It's a feeling
A soul into the light
Every moment in the new
It's my turn to choose
I don't want to be the one to lose
There's a lesson all the time
It's on my mind
I'm setting my intention over you
I don't wanna hide, I'm right here by your side
So I can catch that feeling, I can do this right
I just can't decide, I want you out of sight
Don't try to turn away, I want you to know
I just wanna say that I'm living my life
You turn around and seem to know it's true
There's one thing I can say, I am doing it right
That's how I'm gonna give it to you
Like a butterfly, I can take you high
I can tell you there's no question I can't even try
There's no reason why
I can make you mine
I keep on guessing life without you
We can do this right
I can satisfy
I don't waste no time
You got attention all around you
It's not hard to find
If you don't know why
I can turn back time
Can't deny I'm glad I found you
You're always in my mind (mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind ,mind ,mind ,mind ,mind ,mind ,mind ,mind ,mind ,mind ,mind ,mind ,mind ,mind ,mind ,mind ,mind ,mind ,mind,
