Trust I'm ready for the night left fear and doubt behind
It's over once I step through the door
Party people dancing everywhere
But I feel like the only one in here, in here
It's like the dance floor is a ring and I'm gonna fight the day away
(Manos arriba toda mi gente)
So take a sip of this adrenaline it's about to get crazy
when the DJ drops this song I'ma dance like it's for the win
For the win
We gon' party hardcore this time like it's for the win
For the win
Crazy class in the air
And all the winners in here say yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We gon' party hardcore this time like it's
For the win
For the win, yeah
Esta vez, I want more outta this
I'ma move my body sweat like it's my last night
Goin' all the way this time
Let the rhythm cut me loose
So I can reach the finish line
It's like the dance floor is a ring
And I'm gonna fight the day away
(Final say, but don't blind me, hands up)
So take a sip of this adrenaline
It's about to get crazy
when the DJ drops this song
I'ma dance like it's swallowin'
For the win
We gon party hardcore this time like it's
For the win
For the win
Crazy class in the air all the winners in here say yeah
We gon party hardcore this time like it's
For the win
For the win yeah
Oh, so if you feel what I do
Go on and own the dance floor
Everybody do it like it's for the title
Baila al rimo de la noche
Turn the place out on the breakdown, oh yeah
When the DJ drops this song
I'ma dance like it's for the win, for the win
We gon' party hardcore this time like it's for the win
Follow it
Crazy class in the air
And all the winners in here say yeah
We gon' party hardcore this time
Like it's
Follow it
Follow it
Yeah
