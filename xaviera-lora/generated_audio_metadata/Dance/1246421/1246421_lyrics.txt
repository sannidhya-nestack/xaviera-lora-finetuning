On digital beaches where the bright lights glow
We surf the waves of screens where the cold winds blow
Lost in virtual sunsets with no end in sight
Digital beaches keep us up all night
Digital beaches keep us up all night
Digital beaches where we escape
In the world of pixels where we reshape
Lost in the cold hearts on display
Digital beaches take us away
In the cyber safe
Digital beaches take us away
In the cyber sandcastles we build our homes
Caught in matrix nothings as it seems
Virtual footprints that we leave behind
Digital beaches where we unwind
Digital beaches where we unwind
In the world of pixels where we reshape
Lost in the cold hearts on display
Digital beaches take us away
In the cyberse
Digital beaches take us away
Inside the sandcastles we build our homes
Caught in matrix nothings as it seems
Virtual footprints that we leave behind
Digital beaches where we unwind
Digital beaches where we unwind
In the blue light where we chase our thrills
In the sea of day oil where we get our fills
Connections leading like the tide's up sway
Digital beaches call us to stay
Digital beaches call us to stay
Digital beaches where we escape
In the world of pixels where we reshape
Lost in the cold hearts on display
Digital beaches call us to stay
In the sound I say
Digital beaches take us away
Digital beaches call us to stay
Digital beaches all us to us away
In the virtual horizon where the future lies
Digital beaches under electric skies
Lost in the vision we'll find our way away
Digital beaches where we'll always play
