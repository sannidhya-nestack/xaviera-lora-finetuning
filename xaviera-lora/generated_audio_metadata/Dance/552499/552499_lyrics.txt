We are guns, we are fire
We are guns, we are fire
We are guns, we are fire
It's not safe to sleep now

We love guns, we got fire
We love guns, we got fire
We love guns, we got fire
It's not safe to sleep now
It's not safe to sleep now
We are guns, we are fire
We are guns, we are fire
We are guns, we are fire
We are guns, we are fire
We are guns, we are fire
We are guns, we are fire
We are guns, we are fire
