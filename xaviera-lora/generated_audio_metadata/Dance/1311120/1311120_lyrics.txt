MF Rodriguez
Y'all Peru
From the coast is
Peace that move
Soul is a house
Yeah I feel divine
In coastal Spain
Camelotta
I got truck
At the Sochi lane
Yeah we can
Keep so tight
Every sun
Every pinkly light
I pass away
In the starlight
How soon you'll see magic's all it seems
That soon it comes up, how she swayed, sing her song
And then that record, that's the one song
In every way, a remedy finds its place
A ruse timeless, that's a rate can't erase
Feel the warmth of the coastal promise sun
Soulful tunes, a journey just begun
When the mountains kiss the sea, beats stay blank
There ain't no crap
Feel like ice, glide up the Spanish ice
The tracks unfold, tales of love, past and hope
I got track, got some track
I feel me, keep so tight
I feel excited every night
I feel so high in the starlight
To your speech
Matches fall, mixing leaves
That's a double up
Bunches sway, sing the same song
In that record, there's a different slide
Your graceful soul, it's grand
You can throw nasty candy
A grip we lost, a cat pursuant
Put me down inside
Through the bustling streets of Rosestown
MF Records, we're sounding now
Every vinyl, a treasure to hold
Spinning tales of passion and gold
The Mediterranean whispers sweet serene
Every melody a vibrant scene
With soulful mouths igniting dreams
Lost in rhythms like sunlit beams
Sunlight, the ones you've drawn
But they can't express what they are
And that's why I can't explain it so
That I've always felt so sorry and new
I guess I can't explain it
Feel the beat, keep so tight
Can't stop, don't take me back
I guess I'm in the starlight
My address was so
It's a brand new phone
That's spaghetti
A brand new gloss
That's half the saloons
Over the island inside
Words, the problems just to seem
It's the great white of the rose where we each become alive
Three false and then two is five
So called house, and all is one decision
Great white, sweet and solid life
The honest you don't know
I believe magic, I believe love
And as I grasp a little further
There are all sorts of stories in you
And
You and me, we still fight
Every time, love and delight
The sun in the sky
I miss the whispers of the coastal mist
Damn ass breakfast in every twist
Trapped in tracks with passion sparked
The bus still don't ignite the gun
Salad rice, it's time to see your bone
Rough me back, that's the body of
A frantic, stupid soul
Whereabouts of his or your near
Connection, that's what you make
And I feel the beat, keep yourself tight
And I carry some, don't need to be bagged
I'm just a little, in style
(Badass, badass, badass, badass, badass, badass, badass)
