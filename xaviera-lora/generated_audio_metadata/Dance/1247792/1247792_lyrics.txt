The beat drops, the lights go down, everyone's moving to the sound
I feel the energy in the room, my body wants to move
There's something electric in the air, a spark is throwing me right there
To you like a magnetic pull, I can't resist on losing control
Tonight we're setting this place on fire, burning brighter than a thousand desires
Two souls united, passion inspired
Come alive when I'm with you
Your eyes lock onto mine
Stop the world frozen in time
Every inch of me is alive
Wanting you here by my side
The way you move sets my heart aflame
I call your name but it's not a game
I need you close to feel your embrace
Nothing else matters in this place
Tonight we're setting this place on fire
Burning brighter than a thousand desires
Two souls united, passion is fire
Come alive when I'm with you
The heat between us is blazing
Our bodies crash like waves raising
I'm drugged on the way you make me feel
This rush is so unreal
Tonight we're setting this place on fire
Burning brighter than a thousand desires
Two souls united, passion inspired
Come alive when I'm with you
The heat between us is blazing
Our bodies crash like waves, rays raising
I'm trapped on the way you make me feel
This rush is so unreal
Tonight we're setting this place on fire
Burning brighter than a thousand desires
Two souls united, passion inspired
Come alive when I'm with you
