The whole time
You got me hypnotized
With every little thing
Now I'm thinking I got it, it's mine to do
Won't let you pass that way
So baby won't you stay
Just want to explore this thing you do to me
Ooh baby got me
Ooh baby got me
Ooh baby got me
Ooh baby got me
Can't control what I feel about you
When you glance my way
Am I the party loser since I've left you too
Is this all a game or will you keep the pace
Are you afraid of this thing you do to me
Ooh baby got me
Oh baby
(Hypnotized)
I'm hypnotized by every move
(Hypnotized)
I gotta get more into you
You got me hypnotized and you got me mesmerized
You got me hypnotized and you got me mesnerized
You got me hypnotized and you got me mesnervized
You got me hypnotized and you got me
I just wanna know who you are and what you do
How you got me this way won't you say
Tell me what you do
How you get me this way
I just wanna know who you are and what you do
How you got me this way? (This way, this way, this way)
Tell me what you do
How you got me this way? (How you got me this way?)
I'm going crazy
I just wanna know (I just wanna know)
The whole time
You got me hypnotized
With every little clue
Now I'm thinking I gotta get more into you
Won't let you pass my way
So baby won't you stay
Just one two next to this thing you do to me
Ooh baby got me
Oh baby
Hypnotized
I'm hypnotized by every move
(Hypnotized)
Gotta get more into you
You got me hypnotized and you got me mesmerized
You got me hypnotized and you got me mesnerized
You got me hypnotized and you got me mesnervized
You got me hypnotized and you got me, got me, got me
You got me hypnotized and you got me mesnevised
You got me hypnotized and you got me mesmerized
You got me hypnotized and you got me mesmerized
You got me hypnotized and you got me mes -<|13.16|>
You got me hypnotized and you got me mesnerized
You can make me crazy, you can make me crazy, make me crazy, make me crazy, make me, make me, make me, make me, make me, make me, make me, make me crazy, you can make me crazy, you can make, make, make, make, make, make me crazy
