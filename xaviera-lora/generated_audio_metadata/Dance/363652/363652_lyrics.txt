Na, na, na-na, na, na, na-na-na

Na, na, na-na, na ,Na, na-na-na
I've got so much baggage
I need to hire a caddy
You see I shrink
Try so weak because of issues with your daddy
I got OCD and ADD and you're a schizophrenic
We got VIP passes to the after hours clinic
We're on a collision course baby hidden for danger
I gotta cover my eyes until it's over
We're an accident waiting to happen
We're an accident waiting to happen
Feeling empty, waiting to happen (feeling empty, waiting to happen)
So, waiting to happen
They say that opposites attract, but not in this case
We're both so thrown out of whack, can hardly wait for the taste
Of an electrical, tyrannical, sadistical existence
There's nothing to narcissistic psych better than resistance
Let the neighbors take cover, I don't care what they say
So we'll fight 24 /7, but I like it that way
We were an accident waiting to happen (x4)
We're an accident waiting to happen
We're an accident waiting to happen
We're an accident waiting to happen
We're an accident waiting to happen
And it could be so beautiful
It could be so
Oh, beautiful
We could be so freaking beautiful
So beautiful together, yeah, yeah, yeah
Even if they didn't, waiting to happen
Waiting to happen
I don't see me and me deep in your schizophrenic clinic
We relax today and we're ready to have fun
We relax today and we're ready to have fun
We will see it, waiting to happen (na na na na na na na na na na na)
We will see it, waiting to happen (na na na na na na na na na na)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na (na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
