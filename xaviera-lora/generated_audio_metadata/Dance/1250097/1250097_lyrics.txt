Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Golden grey shine bright
In your eyes tonight
Pictures in my mind
Our love intertwined
Holding hands so tight
Stars are out in sight
Feelings like a dream
In this endless dream
Picturesque love
You're all I'm thinking of
In a frame it fits like a glove
Oh oh oh oh oh
Baby all picturesque love
Walking on the sand
You and I hand in hand
Moments like these
Captured in memories
Time can never fade
The scenes that we've made
Forever will remain
In this love we sustain
Picture is gone
You're all, all, all, all, all, all, all
You're all I'm thinking of, love
Picturesque love, you're all I'm thinking of
In your frame it fits like a glove, oh oh oh oh oh
Baby, our picturesque love
