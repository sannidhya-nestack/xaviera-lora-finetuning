Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me
Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee
Sounds of the real world heard in the day
Love by the moonlight
Have the heart passed away
Beautiful dreamer
Queen of my song
God mother cares of life's busy throng
Beautiful dreamer
Awaken to me
Beautiful dreamer, awaken to me
Oh, awaken to me
Starlight and dewdrops
Are waiting for thee
Sounds of the real world
Hurt in the day
Left by the moonlight
Have the heart passed away
Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song
Come now, the cares of life's busy throng
Beautiful dreamer, awaken to me
Beautiful dreamer, awaken to me
Awaken to me
Sounds of the real world
Look by the moonlight
Have all passed away
Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song
Karma, the curse of life's busy throng
Beautiful dreamer, awaken to me
Beautiful dreamer, awaken to me
Oh, awaken to me
