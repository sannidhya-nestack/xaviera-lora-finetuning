Feeling myself, confidence is soaring
In the spotlight, I'm totally glowing
All eyes on me, jealousy a-pouring
But I don't sweat it, just keep on going
They can't compete with this aura I possess
Level above you, gotta confess
Making jaws drop with my signature finesse
I'm that girl, bow down nothing less
I'm on another level, can't be rivaled
Magnetic energy so undeniable
Captivating, yes it's your unable
To look away, I make your heart unravel
Having a bad attitude all about my mama's teachings
Slaying any competition with my incredible beings
Nothing can penetrate my impenetrable force field
All you see is a queen and you know I'm for real
Unstoppable, unshakeable, you can't break me
Convincible mindset, haters can't phase me
Born a winner, success automatically chases me
I'm iconic, get used to this blazing majesty
I'm on another level, can't be rivaled
Magnetic energy so undeniable
Captivated since you're unable
To look away, I make your heart unravel
Daddy with attitude, all about my mama's teachings
Lay in any competition with my incredible wins
Nothing can penetrate my impenetrable force field
All you see is a queen and you know I'm for real
Unstoppable, unshakable, you can't break me
Invincible, my instincts can phase me
Owner winner success automatically chases me
I'm iconic piece of praise and majesty
I'm on another level can't be rivaled
Magnetic energy so undeniable
Captivating is this you're unable
To look away I'll make your heart unravel
Resonates like my frequency
Elevating humanity's consciousness is fatigue
Ascend in my echelon with royalty
My superlative reigns there's no debating me
I'm on another level, can't be rivaled
Magnetic energy so undeniable
Captivating you since you're unable
To look away, I'll make your heart unravel
