He said, he said, he said, he said, he said
Candles burning, shadows tall
Whispers rising through the hall
Ancient voices chant the doom
Echo deep inside the tomb
Oh, in the night of pain, blood and fire shall remain
Darkness rules, the angels fall
The curse of night consumes us all
Bells are tolling midnight near
Ghostly choirs fill with fear
Frozen statues start to weep
Secrets buried awake from sleep
King, King, King, King, King, King
Horror eternal, Gloria
King, King, Darkness infernal
Voices crying, Souls enslaved
Halloween, The world decayed
(Flash) shadows rise (Flash) demons sing (Sing) welcome to Halloween (Halloween)
Halloween!
