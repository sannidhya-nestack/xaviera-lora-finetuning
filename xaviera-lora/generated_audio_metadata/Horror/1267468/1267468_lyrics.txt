In a forest dark and deep where the shadows silently creep
There stands a house of cobbled stone when whispers fill the ancient bones
Oh, the witch's house on Halloween Eve
Where spirits dance and shadows weep when jackals howl
And whispers blow the spookiest place you'll ever go
Candles flicker in the night
Jack-o-lanterns give their fright
Windows crack, so full of lore
Secrets drift from every door
Oh, the witch's house on Halloween Eve
Where spirits dance and shadows weep
The jackals howl and whispers blow
The sickiest place you'll ever go
Candles flicker in the night
Jack-o'-lanterns give their fright
Windows cracked so full of lore
Secrets drift from every door
Old witches' house on Halloween Eve
Where spirits dance and shadows weep
And jackals howl and whispers low
The spookiest place you'll ever go
Ghostly wails and banshee cries
Underneath the moonlit skies
Midnight strikes and all shall see
The witch's power wild and free
Spiders claw the bats to flight
On this eerie haunting night
The ground of cauldron spirits sway
In the witch's house they'll always stay
Oh, the witch's house on Halloween Eve
Where spirits dance and shadows weave
The cackles, howls, and whispers
Of the spookiest place you'll ever go
So beware my friends and heed this rhyme
From the house where witches bide their time
For once you step through that dark door
You may return nevermore
