Ring the lights so deep and dark
Stands a house haunting mark
Every night as shadows grow
Witches laughter starts to flow
Candles flicker, whispers rise
Underneath the eerie skies
On Halloween Eve the spirits played
Welcoming all who dare to stay
Wicked winds howl through the trees
Mischief dances in the breeze
Ghostly
Figures round the fire chanting their unholy choir
Spooky, dreary, misty air, beware, beware those who dare
Step inside the witch's lair, none who ventured ever fair
Burnstakes flying, cats in tow
Jack-o'-lanterns, eerie glow
Cobwebs hanging, shadows creep
In the night they'll steal your sleep
Dark enchantments, potion brew
Wicked spells are cast on you
Bones are rattling, spirits scream
Living through their haunting dream
Haunted house with windows cracked
History of souls attacked
Watch your step or feel their might
Howl and shriek all through the night
Old man cackles, midnight chills
Heartbeats racing, grasp the thrills
Festive dread and fright galore
Witches curse forevermore
So heed the tale I tell tonight
Of the witch-macabre delight
If you wander to her door
Know this might be forever
Birdsman cackles, midnight chills
Heartbeats racing, grasp the thrills
Festive dread and fright galore
Witch's curse forevermore
So heed the tale I tell tonight
Of the witch-macabre delight
If you wander to her door
Know this might be forever
Burns, mine, cackles, midnight chills
Heartbeats racing'cross the thrills
Festive dread and fright galore
Witch's curse forevermore
