In a village far and old
Where the tales are often told
Lies a house of stone and wood
Witches haunting haunted hood
Lanterns lit with eerie glow
Cast their shadows to and fro
Pumpkins grinning teeth so bright
Greet the moon on Hallows Night
Come gather round the witches door
On Halloween we'll fear no more, no more
A spell of whisper in the tree
Dance with horror, wild and free
That's a loft in midnight sky
Ghosts and ghouls go drifting by
Creaking stairs and whispers low
In the witch's house you'll go
Black cats and sweet buys of fire
Cauldron bubbles meet this fire
Hag and cloak with cackles sharp
Plays her tune on haunted harp
Come gather round the witch's door
On Halloween we'll fear no more, no more
A spell of whisper in the tree
Dance with horror, wild and free
Boomsticks sweep the cobbled path
The winds howl through the widow's wrath
Children's laughter, bells that chime
Mark the passage of the time
Candles flicker, shadows leap
In the night of restless sleep
Spooky tales in whispers shared
In the witch's house, take care
Come gather round the witch's door
On Halloween, we'll fear no more, no more
A spell, a whisper in the tree
Dance with horror, wild and free
So heed the call of Halloween
In the night where none are seen
A witch's house upon the hill
Waits to cast its ancient thrill.
