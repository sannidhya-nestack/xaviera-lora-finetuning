In the field he stands so tall
Mr. Scarecrow hears it all
In the night he starts to creep
Through the shadows he will seek
Got a pumpkin for a head
Straw filled body so undead
Watch him dance through moonlit haze
In his eyes a fiery blaze
Mr. Scarecrow's on the prowl
Hear a bat speak into howl
Tango steps so eerie strange
In the dark his face deranged
Sparing crows with mocking tune
Underneath the ghastly moon
Ragged clothes and twisted grin
He's the master of the sin
Mr. Scarecrow's on the prowl
Hear the bats begin to howl
Tangled steps so eerie strange
In the dark his face deranged
When the night turns pitchy black
Mr. Scarecrow comes to track
Every footfall, every sound
On his haunted spooky ground
Was the scarecrow on the prowl
Hear the bats begin to howl
Tango steps so eerie strange
In the dark his face drained
When the night turns pitchy black
Mr. Scarecrow comes to track
Every footfall, every sound
On his haunted spooky ground
(Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
