Halloween's here, the moon is full
The air is cool, the shadows pull
Monsters, goblins sought to rule
Tonight we break every rule
Halloween, oh Halloween The scariest night that's ever been
Ghosts and witches on the scene It all feels like a dream
Jack-o'-lanterns lit so bright
Telling tales of the night
Candy corn and delights
Brought by eerie ghostly knights
Halloween, oh Halloween
The spookiest night you've ever seen
Don't be shy, don't be mean
On this night of Halloween
