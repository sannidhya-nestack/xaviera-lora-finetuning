It's Halloween
It's Halloween, a time for tricks and treats
(Treats, treats)
We wear our spooky costumes as we walk the moonlit streets
(Treats, treats)
Witches, ghosts and vampires are how they bring us joy
Every girl and every boy playing with their spooky toy
Halloween, Halloween, oh what a scary sight
Pumpkins are glowing in the moonlight
Bats are flying, cats are prowling, everyone's in delight
Oh what a fun, it's Halloween night
Knock on the door, trick or treat, we say so loud and clear (clear, clear)
We open up our bags and hope some candy will appear (appear, appear)
Snickers, Twix and Tootsie Rolls, oh what a sweet delight (blah)
Laughing and giggling into the spooky mess
Halloween, Halloween, oh what a scary sight
Pumpkins are glowing in the moonlight
Bats are flying, cats are growling, everyone's in delight
Oh what a fun, it's Halloween night
Knock on the door, trick or treat, we say so loud and clear (clear, clear)
We open up our bags and hope some candy will appear (appear, appear)
Snickers, Twix and Tootsie Rolls, oh what a sweet delight
Laughin' and gigglin' into the spooky nights
Halloween, Halloween, oh, what a magical time
Ghosts are whispering riddles in rhyme
The last cat's hissing calls, it's wobbling under the moonshine
Oh, what a night, it's Halloween time
So here's to Halloween with its candy bags and spooks
Enjoy the fun and laughter, that's the rule, it's spoilers, no spooks
Here's to every princess, pirate, robot and vampire spike
Happy Halloween to all and to all a spooky night
Oh, what a scary sight
Pumpkins are glowing in the moonlight
Bats are flying, cats are prowling, everyone's in delight
