Goblins dance, inspectors wail
Through the lanes, a ghostly trail
Creaking doors and howls, beware
Witches laugh, the fools, beware
Spooky shadow spirits rise
Underneath the moonlit skies
Vested fear and eerie glee
On Halloween eve, so hauntingly
Jack-o'-lanterns green so white
Children scurry trying to hide
From the witch's cackling spell
In her house the darklings dwell
(Outro)
