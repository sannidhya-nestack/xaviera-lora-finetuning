In the moon's pale glow through the mist and the murk
Lies a house on the hill where the shadows all lurk
With a cackle and a whisper on a broom she flies
Through the creaking old door with her black cat eyes
Welcome to the witch's house
On this eerie Halloween Eve
Where the phantoms dance and call and shadows never leave
There's a cauldron boiling filled with a ghastly brew
A potion for the lost souls wandering through
Cobwebs hang like curtains over ghostly light
As the spirits rise up to revel in the night
In the room's pale glow through the mist and the murk lies a house on the hill where the shadows all lurk
With a capillana whisper on a broom she flies through the creaking old door with her black cat eyes
Welcome to the witch's house on this eerie Halloween
Where the phantoms dance in cold and shadows never leave
The pumpkins they are grinning with their flaming eyes
Underneath the twisted ancient gnarly trees that rise
Badfoot overhead, there's a chill in the air
In this tale of terror where the bold don't dare despair
The bell tolls midnight
The witch begins her spell
Enchantments in the wind
Her laughter breaks the stillness well
The spires spin their silken threads
The ravens cry their song
On this fine chilly night
Where the hollow dead belong
Welcome to the witch's house
On this eerie Halloween eve
Where the phantoms dance in cold
And shadows never leave
So as you walk the winding path, hear the spooky rhyme
The witch's house awaits you when the clock strikes the time
With every shiver down your spine, let the mysteries weave
For all who step inside can never trust what they perceive
In the mead field glow through the mist and the murk
Was the witch's house on the hill where the shadows all look
