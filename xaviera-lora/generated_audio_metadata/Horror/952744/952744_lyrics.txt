Death be not proud
Mindsly and dreadfully
Mindsly and dreadfully
That's being on prowl
That's being on prowl
Fighting Dreadful
Dynamical Death
Death be not proud, though some have called thee mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so
For those whom thou thinkest thou dost overthrow, die not for death, nor yet canst thou kill me
Die not for dead
Mighty and dreadful
Destiny not proud
Destiny not proud
Destiny not proud
Death do not prowl
Dine on your death
Nor yet canest thou kill me
