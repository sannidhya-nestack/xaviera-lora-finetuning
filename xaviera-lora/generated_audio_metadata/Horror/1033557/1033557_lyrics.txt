Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
We made a, we made a, we made a Halloween song
We made a, we made a Halloween song
Aye hold up look if I don't get these treats
Yo you gone get these tricks
That's the nature of the social contract
Bro I did it make up it I did it
We gone go to the rich neighborhood
Where they got them full sizes
Maybe they got costco memberships
And don't pay full prices
Maybe October is it
And it's the best month of the year, I said it
Number one Zodiac, we know where to party at
Just follow me, yo
Gettin' that money, that's dollar-ween
Gettin' good grades, that's scholarween
Next month turkey and collard greens
But right now it's Halloween
Halloween
We need a Halloween song
Halloween
We need a Halloween song
Yo, you think I'm on a track, DPM app
I know you like this content (okay)
Spare me your nonsense, all up in my comments
Jake found the beat, he was like, "Mom, it's sick like gravy" (haha)
Candy, costumes, haunted houses
This is a boy where Jake go crazy
It's Halloween, bump it at the trunk or treat
Halloween
Pump it at the trunk of treats
Pumpkin shaped Reese's, they the best believe me
Snickers bars sweet tarts Hershey's kisses better than Christmas
Can you tell I need a sponsor? I'm for real though, I need a sponsor
She does, I ain't got nothing to rhyme with that, oh wait, Monsters, good one
Cause it's Halloween
We need a Halloween song (I mean we only got five)
We need a Halloween song (play this after thriller)
This beat won't ever be wrong (cause you already played it about time)
We need a Halloween song (come on, you know that routine by now)
We need a Halloween song (at your costume party)
This beat won't ever be wrong (I'm just sayin' it wrong)
Well, this ain't your playlist too
Between Monster Mash and Ghostbusters songs
That's the Halloween spirit
Get it? Get it?
Give it all a chance
I'm sayin' just put it in your playlist
We made a Halloween song
Bump it at the trunk a treat
We made a Halloween song
Bump it at the trunk a treat
Since we will never be around
But bump it at your trunk a treat
We made a Halloween song
Bump it at your trunk a treat
We made a Halloween song
Bump it at your trunk a treat
This beat will never be on
Bump it as your trunk or train
We made a Halloween song
Bump it as your trunk or train
