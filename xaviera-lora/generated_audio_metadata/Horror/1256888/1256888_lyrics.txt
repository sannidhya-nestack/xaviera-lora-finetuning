It's the middle of October, moon is full
The night is magic, the air is cool
Skeletons, witches and ghosts take flight
Through the shadows of this Halloween night
Halloween, Halloween, all Hallows Eve
Pumpkins growing, a sight to believe
Tricks and treats under the midnight weave
This is the night of Halloween
The costume parade through the dimly lit streets
Candies and whispers and heart beating beats
Haunting echoes, laughs and screams
Embrace the wonders this eve it seems
Halloween, Halloween, a night of fear
Whispers of the unknown in your ear
In this spooky revelry we cheer
Oh the joy of Halloween is here
Bats take flight, owls hoot in the night
Spiders web glinting in the pale moonlight
A celebration like no other in sight
Halloween, oh what a delightful fright
From dawn until the striking midnight
Sharing tales that bring us light fright
Every laugh, every scream feels just right
On this haunting, enchanting Halloween night
Halloween
The costume parade through the dimly-lit streets
Candies and whispers and heart-beating beats
Haunting echoes, laughs and screams
Embrace the wonders this eve, it's eve it seems
Halloween, Halloween, a night of fear
Whispers of the unknown in your ear
In the spooky revelry we cheer
Oh, the joy of Halloween is here
The costume parade through the dimly lit streets
Candies and whispers and heart beating beats
Haunting echoes, laughs and screams
Embrace the wonders this eve it seems
