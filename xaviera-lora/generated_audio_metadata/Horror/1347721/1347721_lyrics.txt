Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
The first dark room, a spooky sight
With ghostly figures glowing bright
They play with toys that spin and roll
Then disappear into a hole
I'm walking through the haunted hall
Not scared at all, no not at all
The friendly ghosts and ghouls I meet
Make this house feel so bittersweet
The dining room has a dusty table with phantom guests who are more than able to float right by and offer tea and a spooky ghost just for me
I'm walking through the haunted hall
Not scared at all, no not at all
The friendly ghosts and ghouls I meet
Make this house feel so bittersweet
Up the creek he stares, a spooky sound
A little creature comes from the ground
He gives a pop and a little cheer
Happy Halloween, I'm so glad you're here
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
The house is empty, all is still
But I'll be back to play until
