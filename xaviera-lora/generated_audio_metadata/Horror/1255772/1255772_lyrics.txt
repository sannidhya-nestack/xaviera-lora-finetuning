Halloween, Halloween, oh what a sight
Pumpkins glowing bright in the night
Trick or treat, say it's sweet
Waiting for a yummy treat
Halloween, Halloween, so much fun
Ghosts and witches on the run
Candy here and candy there
Sweetness is in the air
See the bats flying high
In the dark October sky
Costumes on, let's have some fun
Halloween has just begun
Halloween, Halloween, laugh and scream
It's all part of the nightly dream
Knock on doors, then you'll see
How fun Halloween can be
Halloween, Halloween, now it's time to end the scene
Say goodnight, turn off the light, until next year's spooky night
