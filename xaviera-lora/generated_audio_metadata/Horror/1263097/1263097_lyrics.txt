In a realm where shadows reign
Cold whispers stir the midnight's pain
Under a moon as pale as frost
Deeper into the dark we're lost
Hear the ghastly lullaby
In the barren sky where spirits fly
Dancing bones in the crypt's alley
Sing the chorus of the night's finale
Through the cold stone corridors
Music of the night forever soars
Violins weep their haunted tune
In the chilling symphony of the moon
