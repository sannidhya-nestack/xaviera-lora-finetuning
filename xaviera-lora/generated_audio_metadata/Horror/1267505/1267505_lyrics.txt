In a dark and eerie wood
Where a crooked house once stood
Beneath the moon's pale glow
On a Halloween long ago
Winds were whispering through the trees
Casting shadows, ghostly breeze
Witches' cackles filled the air
Mask your fright if you dare
Oh come gather round and hear
the season of the fear
By the light of lanterns gleam
Welcome to your darkest dreams
In that house of creaks and groans
Lay the witches cursed of bones
Dripping candles spectral wail
Tales of horror never stale
Spiders spun their silky threads
Crossed the floor where spirits tread
Black cats yelled and eyes aglow
Secrets owned
These shadows know, come gather round and hear
the season of the fear
By the light of lanterns gleam
Welcome to your darkest dreams
