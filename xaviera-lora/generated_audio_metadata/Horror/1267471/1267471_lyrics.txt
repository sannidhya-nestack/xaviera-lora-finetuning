In the dark, men in their shrouded skins
The witches chant and the night enchants
A house of legends so old and grand
Lures the curious to its haunted band
Gather round on Halloween eve
Where the witches weave their spell
In a house where shadows breathe
Hark the tolling midnight bell
Hark the tolling midnight bell
Are the flicker of the moon's pale light
Our old souls in the deep of night
Whispers echo in the autumn air
Of the secrets hidden there
Candles flicker in the windows high
Skeletons dance, spirits dance
Creaking doorways bid you near
To a land of dread, to a land of fear
Gather round on Halloween eve
Where the witches weave their spell
In the house where shadows breathe
Hark the tolling midnight bell
Hark the tolling midnight bell
On cauldrons thick with garlic brew
De facto whispers none know who
Bats and spiders weave their thread
the house of chilling dread
But where the flicker of the moon's pale light
Huddled souls in the deep of night
Whispers echo in the autumn air
Of the secrets hidden there
By the flicker of the moon's pale light
Huddled souls in the deep of night
Huddled souls in the deep of night
With the moon's pale light
Of the moon's pale light
Gather'round on Halloween Eve where the witches weave their spell
In the house where shadows breathe, hark the tolling midnight bell
Hark the tolling midnight bell
But why the flicker of the moon's pale light
Huddle souls in the deep of night
Whispers echo in the autumn air
Of the secrets hidden there
Candles flicker in the windows
