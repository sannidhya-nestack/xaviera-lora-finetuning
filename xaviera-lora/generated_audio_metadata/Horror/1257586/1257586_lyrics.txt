Creeping through the shadows underneath the moonlight
Unseen, unheard in the chill of the spooky night
Witches on their brooms laughing in delight
Ghosts and ghouls roaming, it's a scary sight
Halloween, Halloween, night of the fright
Masks and costumes in every street light
Jack-o'-lanterns grin with a fearsome light
Halloween, Halloween, oh what a night
Haunted houses speaking, cobwebs twirling tight
Black cats prowling under the pumpkin light
Candy wrappers rustling in the children's sight
Skeletons are dancing in the graveyard left and right
Halloween, Halloween in the eerie night
Trick or treat ringing out in the cold moonlight
In every shadow waits a new eerie sight
Halloween, Halloween feel the spooky might
As dawn replaces night and fear is out of sight
We wave goodbye until next year's fright
