There's a chill in the air, everyone beware
On this frightful night something isn't right
Flickering lanterns cast spooks in sight
It's Halloween where day turns into night
Witches cappling bats in the moonlit sky
Ghosts are lurking as the time goes by
Grab your costumes and put on your mask
Temper your courage for the eerie task
Halloween, Halloween, time to scream
The night of fright under the moonbeam
Trick or treat through the creepy street
This ghastly night's the living and the dead meet
Pumpkins grinning with their eeriest face
In every shadow a monster does brace
Behind every door a nightmare to embrace
It's Halloween in an uncanny space
Halloween, Halloween, everything's unseen
A spooky spectacle in the night sheen
Knock on the doors under the night's gleam
Halloween, Halloween, where fear is the routine
Midnight shines as the fears unwind
Look back on the night, what terror did you find?
As the sun peaks up, leave the scares behind
It's Halloween where shadows are outlined
Where shadows outlined
Were shadows outlined
