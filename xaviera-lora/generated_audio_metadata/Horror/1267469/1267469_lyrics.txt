In the dark and winding night,'neath the pale moon's sight
A witch's house, too tall and fright
Where shadows come to life
In the village, whispers grew as the clock struck midnight true
Festive fears, they all accrue
When Halloween is due
Oh, gather'round the haunted sound
It's Halloween Eve tonight
Beware the witch, her magic rich
Under the eerie light
With horror's tune under the moon
The spirits come to play
A simple tale with faces pale
On this haunted holiday
Candles flicker in the gloom while whispers fill the room
Spooky ghosts in costume loom like echoes from the tomb
Through the forest children creep where secrets never sleep
Into the witches' hold so deep where fear their heart shall see
Oh gather around the haunted sound, it's Halloween Eve tonight
Beware the witch, her magic rich
Under the eerie light
With horror's tune under the moon
The spirits come to play
A simple tale with faces pale
On this haunted holiday
In the cauldron bubbles brew smells of fright and ghastly blue
Flying brustets in the view, the festive night ensues
Laughter hides behind the veil of jack-o'-lanterns, faces frail
Simple yet so potent tale, that turns the young to pale
