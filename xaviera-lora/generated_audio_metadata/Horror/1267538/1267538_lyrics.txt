In the heart of a town where shadows dance
Stands a house, a witch's chance
Candles flicker in the night
Sitting spirits all alight
Oh Halloween Eve, the winds do howl
At the passing of a witch's scow
Festive lights and creeping gloom
This haunted house shall seal your doom
Spooky tales and ghostly wails
Echo through the midnight veil
Witchy cackles shadows creep
On this night none shall sleep
Gather round, the moon is high
As bats and broomsticks sweep the sky
Candied apples, masks of fright
Welcome to the witch's night
Halloween, oh Halloween
In this house, the haunting queen
Simple chants and eerie spells
Drawn you are by mystic swells
In the corner, spirits linger
Daunting with their icy fingers
Windows rattle, floors do creak
In this house, the dead do speak
