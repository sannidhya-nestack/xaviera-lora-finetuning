In the heart of October when the moon is high (moon is high)
Creepy shadows whisper and the bats fly by (fly by)
Knocking on your door hear the children's screams (children's screams)
Welcome to the night of frightful dreams
Halloween, Halloween, night of the unseen
Creeping shadows whisper and the bats fly by
Knocking on your door, hear the children's screams
Welcome to the night of frightful dreams
Halloween, Halloween, night of the unseen
Witches, ghosts and creatures prowling oh so mean
Halloween, Halloween, when the lights go dim
We're celebrating the night, let the smoke fest begin
Orange pumpkins glowing, an eerie sight
Cobbled on the porches under the moonlight
Trick or treat they chat dressed in disguise
Tales of haunted houses and spooky surprise
Halloween, Halloween, night of the unseen
Monsters ghouls and goblins are now the main scene
Halloween, Halloween, when the lights go dim
Join the dance of death, let the fear sink in
As midnight shines, ending the ghoulish spree
Remember the magic of the night's scary spree
Until next time, say goodbye to the scream
In the enchanting night of Halloween
