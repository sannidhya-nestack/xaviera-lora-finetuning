I'll never love you
In the depth of the night
Beneath the old will of shadow
Creeping silence whispers
Through the Halloween meadow
Scallops and hands rise
From their graves so cold
Echoing chilling stories
From the days of old
It's a dark, ambient Halloween
Where spirits roam unseen
Beneath the blood-red moonlight's gleam
It's a dark, ambient dream
In the haunting hour
Where the clock hands freeze
Ghouls dance in the fog
With a ghostly ease
The black cat's eyes glow in the dim lit street
On this dark ambient Halloween where spectral sights you'll meet
It's a dark ambient Halloween where phantoms hold the scene
Away from human sight they convene in the dark ambient serene
As the Halloween night grows still
