In the deep of the night when the moon's glowing bright
There's a house on a hill that's been lost to the sight
With the whispering winds and the chill in the air
Witches brew in the cauldron casting spells everywhere
Oh, witch's house on Halloween Eve
Where shadows dance and spirits grieve
Candles flicker and the jack-o'-lanterns gleam
In a place where nightmares and reality convene
Goblins and ghosts, they gather around
In the yard where the old twisted trees abound
A black cat crosses and the ravens cry
Underneath the eerie glow of the spectral sky
Pull the witch's house on Halloween Eve
Where shadows dance and spirits grieve
Candles flicker and the jackal enters gleam
In the place where nightmares and reality convene
Through the cobwebs and the creaky door
Footsteps echo on the cold stone floor
Beware the potions and the wicked broom
In the lair where the witch crafts her doom
The clock strikes twelve and the spell is cast
For the spirits of the night to join the ghastly blast
Skeletons rattle and the werewolves howl
As the witch stirs her brew with a sinister scowl
Oh, the witch's house, a howling heave
Where shadows dance and spirits grieve
Candles flicker and the jackal enters gleam
In a place where nightmares and reality convene
Three, the warning says to clear of the door
For the witch's house holds tales of yore
On Halloween night it's best to believe
And steer clear of the house on Halloween
