In the woods they're up and bright under the candlelight
Ghosts are dancing, shadows prancing, Halloween is inside
She's a ruling jack-o-lanterns growing, she lifts down the spine
Trick or treat, hear the heartbeat in the haunted moonshine
Oh it's Halloween, feel the magic on its theme
In the darkness, in the stillness where the eerie has been
Hear the whispers of the wind where the chill begins
Frightened from the night it's begun, let the Halloween win
Spiders spinning, spirits grinning through the creepy old mansion
Midnight knocks, tick-tock clocks add to the chilling tension
Wrapped in a cloak beneath the oak, a story untold
Silver moon dries near, burning eye, secrets unfold
Is it a trick or is it a treat?
Feel the Halloween beat
Carrying art under the facade
It's a spooky retreat
Join the parade, don't be afraid
That's the Spectre Suite
On this Halloween night
In the ghostly light
Where the shadows creep
Oh, it's Halloween, feel the magic unseen, you can see
In the darkness, in the darkness
In the stillness where the eerie has been, the eerie has been
The whispers of the wind where the chill begins
Frightened from the night has begun, let the Halloween win
Spiders spin and spirits sprinting through the creepy old mansion
In my notes, tick-tock clocks, active the ghillie has been
In the whispers of the wind where the chill begins
Frightened from the night has begun let the Halloween wind
Spiders spinning spirits grinning through the creepy old mansion
In the knocks ticked clocks add to the chilling tension
Wrapped in a cloak beneath the open story untold
Silver moon's rise mirrored in high secrets unfold
The moment's arrived and is it a treat? Feel the Halloween beat
Feel the Halloween beat
Is it a trick or is it a treat
Feel the Halloween beat
Feel the Halloween beat
Is it a trick or is it a treat
Feel the Halloween beat
Eerie and odd under the facade
It's a spooky retreat
Join the parade, don't be afraid as the spectres sweep
On this Halloween night in the ghostly light where the shadows creep
As the dawn breaks and the spirit quakes
Bidding Halloween goodbye
They'll lift the round shifts under the morning sky
Until next year hold the memories dear as the magic spins
