Hollow beneath a shadowed light
A witch's house with eerie light
In the woods so dark and deep
Where restless souls forever sleep
With spooky tales of witches' brooms
Lurking, creeping out of view
Skeletons dance in the moon's cold glare
Festive whispers fill the air
Candles flicker, firelight
Casting spells to curse the night
Black cats yowl and ravens caw
Drawing all to witchly law
Spooky tales of witches' brew
Lurking, creeping out of view
Skeletons dance in the moon's cold glare
Festive whispers fill the air
Goblins filled with blood red wine
Ghosting goblins intertwine
Midnight chimes, witches flight
Sorrows through clouds of pale moonlight
Pumpkins grin with jagged smile
