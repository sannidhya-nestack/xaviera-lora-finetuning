Fly from dry to sky, fly to sky, fly to sky, fly to sky (I will never be the same)
Fly from dry to sky, fly to sky, fly to sky, fly to sky (I will never be the same)
Like the flying army standing at the door
Half to passing night we standing on store
Falling on your knees, repairing all the ashes
Destiny decided you're a victim of the night power
Night power
High from dry, high sky, high sky, high sky, high sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, high from dry, high from dry, high from dry, high sky, high sky, high from dry, high sky, high sky, high sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky
I've been falling to the floor
Dripping fast tears
Sweating, dripping blood
Nothing in the eye of sight to reveal
Destiny is haunting you, hungry of the unknown
