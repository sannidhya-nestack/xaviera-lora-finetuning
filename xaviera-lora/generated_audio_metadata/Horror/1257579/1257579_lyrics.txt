Draining down through the night, under the pale moonlight
Ghosts and ghosts at sight, Halloween's delight
Witches flying high, ghosts across the sky
On this spooky night, mysteries ignite
Humpkin faces glowing in the eerie flowy
The air is cold, the wind is blowing
Trick or treat the kids are showing
In their spooky garb that they're growing
Halloween, oh Halloween
The night of fright and scream
Monsters in the shadows unseen
Underneath the haunted moon's gleam
Lacking cats prowling near
Croaks whispering in the air
A chill in the air
But do not fear
The spirit of Halloween is here
The haunted house at the end of the lane
Hide behind masks, join the masquerade train
Candy and hand join in the fun
Halloween night has just begun
Oh Halloween, oh Halloween
A night so wickedly keen
Celebrate in the pitch black scene
Underneath the haunted moon's gleam
As the night draws to an end
Spooky spirits start to descend
Halloween my eerie friend
Will return to scare again
