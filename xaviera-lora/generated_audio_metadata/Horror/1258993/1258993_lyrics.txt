Don't walk in the park after dark
There are creepy creatures lurking
Like one-eyed purple people eaters
And Eula Tomatoes burping
Chardonnay's on the beach sharpening his teeth
It's guaranteed to give you a fright
That's alright, it's Halloween night
Halloween night, that freaky time of year
When the dead rise from the grave
And the ghosts, goblins and ghouls
Put fear in the hearts of the brave
Dress up like Bambi, trick or treat for candy
Keep a bottle of holy water sprites
That's alright, it's Halloween night
Buffy kills Bella, but go see
Frankenstein clips Freddy Krueger's nails
Crazy Michael Myers, psycho clowns with pliers
Werewolves and gargoyle tales
Turn on a light if you wanna sleep tight, that's right
That's alright, it's Halloween night
Halloween night, that freaky time of year
When the dead rise from the grave
And the ghosts, goblins and ghouls
The fear in the hearts of the brave
Dress up like Bambi, trick or treat for candy
Keep a bottle of holy water sprite
That's alright, it's Halloween night
Halloween night, I want my bat droppings
Halloween night, and venomous spider legs
Halloween night
Give me some magic toads
And I'll be happy
