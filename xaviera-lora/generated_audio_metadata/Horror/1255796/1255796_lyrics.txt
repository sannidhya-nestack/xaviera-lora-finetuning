Halloween, Halloween, oh what a sight
Pumpkins glow in the night
Costumes on, now we're ready to go
Out in the night with moonlight's glow
Trick or treat, we happily shout
Going door to door, running about
Candy here, candy there
Sweet treats everywhere
Ghosts and witches come out to play
On this special spooky holiday
We laugh and sing all through the night
Halloween fun is pure delight
Halloween, Halloween is sitting neat
All dressed up for the treat so sweet
It's the best night we all agree
Happy, happy Halloween as happy as can be
Halloween night now ends with cheer
We'll wait for you again next year
A night of fun, a night of spree
Goodbye Halloween'til we next see
Trick or treat, we happily shout
Going door to door, barring about
Candy here, candy there
Sweet treats everywhere
Ghosts and witches come out to play
On this special spooky holiday
We laugh and sing all through the night
Halloween fun is pure delight
Halloween, Halloween, isn't it neat?
All dressed up for the treat, so sweet
It's the best night, we all agree
Happy, happy Halloween, as happy as can be
It's happy as can be
Halloween night now ends with cheer
We'll wait for you again next year
A night of fun, a night of free good
