On Halloween night, oh what fun
Wear a costume and we'll run
Ghosts and witches, everyone, boo
It's Halloween, the joy has just begun
Trick or treat, shout with glee
Candies for you and me, me
Knocking doors, one, two, three
On Halloween night, as happy as can be
As can be
Silly monsters, pumpkins bright
In the spooky, cool night
Sharing scares and pure delights
Boo, it's Halloween with all our might
Trick or treat, shout with glee
Fill our bags'til we can see
Thanks for treats, we all agree
On Halloween nights, we feel so free
So let's say goodnight to the Halloween fun
Wait'til next year when again it will come
With a smile and wave the night is done
Halloween, Halloween, you're number one
