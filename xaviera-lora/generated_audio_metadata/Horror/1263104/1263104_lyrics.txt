Underneath the midnight shroud where the spectres play
Through crackling silence their notes break away
Each string strums a tale each soul with its own say
In the garden of shadows where the end of days lay
Hear the whispers of the wind
Dancing with the ivy
The symphony of the lost, a haunting rhapsody
In the theater of the night, all masks in disarray
Embrace the melody that lures the light astray
Carved from the echoes of a timeless decree
In the grand ballroom of the un otten you and me
We waltz in the face of the elusive where no eyes can see
To the rhythm of our heartbeats we set our spirits free
In the citadel of dreams
