Underneath the pale moonlight
On this chilling Halloween night
Skeletons dancing left and right
To the rhythm of the eerie fry
Pumpkins grinning, eyes so bright
Glowing in the spooky sight
Halloween, Halloween
Oh what a thrill to be seen
Ghosts and witches on the scene
Walking through the night so keen
Dracula rising from his tomb
Flying through the nightly gloom
Werewolves howling at the moon
Announcing Halloween will end soon
Trick or treat is singing soon
Sweep the streets like a monsoon
Oh, Halloween, Halloween
Filled with delight and scar on scene
In the night creatures convene
For the time of Halloween
Don't even bat an eye
When you see a witch fly by
It's just another magic in the sky
On this enchanted devil's night
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
Where everything's not what it seems
A night of fear, a night of screams
That's the magic of Halloween
Tracking nightmares, the laughter ends
Until next year, my spooky friends
Halloween, Halloween'til we meet in this magic scene
