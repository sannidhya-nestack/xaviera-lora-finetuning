In the depths of the night on Halloween Eve
There's a tale to be told you wouldn't believe
Where the shadows dance and the witches weave
A house on a hill causing hearts to seize
Witches' house on the old cobble lane
And where the whispers of the past drive you nearly insane
Candles flicker and the ghosts remain
In the witch's house, you'll never feel the same
Through the creaky door on that fateful night
Who dares step in, who dares it fight
With the moon so full, casting eerie light
A cauldron bubbles, a chilling sight
Witch's house on the old cobbler lane
Where the whispers of the past drive you nearly insane
Candles flicker and ghosts remain
In the witch's house, I'll never feel the same
Through the creaky door, on that fateful night
Who dares step in, who dare take flight
With the moon so full, casting eerie light
A call time bubbles, a chilling sight
Witch's house on the old cobbler lane
Where the whispers of the past drive you nearly insane
Candles flicker and the ghosts remain
In the richest house, you'll never feel the same
Through the creaky door on that fateful night
Who dares step in, who dare take flight
With the moon so full, casting eerie light
A cauldron bubbles, a chilling sight
Eyes of blind cats and bones on the floor
Potions brewing, secrets galore
Hear the wicked cackle, just outside the door
In this haunted place, they'll ask you for more
Spirits wail and chains they rattle
In the house where witches prattle
Shadows twist in ghastly battle
Lost in the night, no light to tattle
Witches house on the old cobble lane
Where the whispers of the past running nearly insane
Candles flicker and the ghosts remain
In the witches house who never feel the same
So we were taken
