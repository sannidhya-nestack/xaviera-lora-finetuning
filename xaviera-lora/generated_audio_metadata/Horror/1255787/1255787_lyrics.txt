On this eve of Halloween
What's that I just think I've seen
Is it a pumpkin big and round
Or ghosts floating without sound
Halloween, oh Halloween
It's the night that's made for fun and scream
Trick or treating down the lane
Hope it won't be just plain rain
Witches fly across the moon
After dusk but before the moon
Candy corn and chocolate treat
Wouldn't it be so sweet
Halloween, oh Halloween
The coolest egg you've ever seen
Spooky, scary, don't adjust
We hope you find it just the best
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Coolest egg you've ever seen
Clothes that you've never seen
Spooky, scary and unadjusted
Hope you'll find the dress that best
So let's put on our costumes bright
And celebrate this spooky night
With a laugh and a song
We'll play along
In the Halloween night where we belong
Please remember don't get mean
On this night of Halloween
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
The coolest sight you've ever seen
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
The coolest sight you've ever seen
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Stupid, scary and all unjust
We hope you'll find it just the best
So cool inside of your heart
Celebrate and celebrate this stupid night
Where's the laughing song we'll play along on Halloween night where we belong?
Please remember don't be mean on this night of Halloween
