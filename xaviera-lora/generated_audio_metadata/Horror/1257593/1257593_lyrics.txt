Walking through the night under the moon so bright
Halloween's delight is causing quite the fright
Pundits glow with eerie light, witches take flight
On this magic filled night all the ghouls unite
Halloween, Halloween night of mystery and gleam
Secrets hidden in the moon's beam
Trick or treat is the theme
Ghosts around every corner adding to the horror
Candy plants grow fuller as we explore further
Spider webs shimmer under the ghostly glimmer
In the haunted manor even the brave may shiver
Halloween, Halloween, filled with sights unseen
In our costumes we can be celebrating in the night serene
Voices whisper in the gale, telling an ancient tale
Of spirits beneath the veil as through the night we sail
Hollow weep, hollow weep, in your magic we're keen
Underneath the silvery sheen we honor the mystery queen
As the dawn begins to peak and the monsters return to sleep
In our hearts the memories we'll keep until Halloween again
