In the womb lies eerie glow
Where the shadows dance and grow
Down the lane where whispers creep
Lies a house where secrets sleep
Witches' cackle fills the air
Ancient spells weave through the lair
Candles flicker, spirits play
On this haunted Halloween day
Oh, the witch's house on Halloween Eve
Where the night's dark mysteries weave
Come inside where secrets dwell
In the witch's house under the spell
Cauldrons bubble, potions brew
Ghostly figures sway in view
Black cats purr, their eyes agleam
In this chilling festive dream
Skeletons rattle, zombies rise
Underneath the cold black skies
Pumpkins grin with fiery light
Guiding through the ghostly night
Oh, the witch's house on Halloween Eve
Where the night's dark mysteries weave
Come inside where secrets dwell
In the witch's house under the spell
