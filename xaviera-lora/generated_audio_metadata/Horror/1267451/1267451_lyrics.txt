In the woods so deep tonight
Moon is full of haunting light
Eerie chill in autumn air
Through the forest shadows stare
Creaky door and dusty floor
Witch's house, tales of yore
Candles flicker, whispers creep
Pumpkin faces start to weep
Oh, on Halloween Eve
Wicked charms and tricks conceived
Ghostly winds, they swarm and weep
In the witch's house only believe
Cauldron bubbles, potions brew
Spells are cast, the night turns blue
Guts take flight, an eerie song
Join the dance, it won't be long
Black cat sneaks with eyes so bright
Spiders spin and webs of fright
Owl hoots from highest tree
Mystic runes, a mystery
Oh, oh, oh, I'm Halloween-y
Wicked charms and tricks conceived
Ghostly wings, they swirl and weave
In the witch's house if we believe
Shadows twist in mystic dance
Underneath the ghoul's advance
Every creak and every groan
Echoes from the haunted stone
Children dressed as ghosts and ghouls
Skipping past enchanted halls
Bonfires blaze, the night's alive
Through the tales old spirits thrive
Oh, oh, oh, on Halloween Eve
Wicked charms and tricks conceived
Ghostly winds, they swirl and weep
In the witch's house, we believe
Horror music fills the night, scaring all with sheer delight
Evil laughter, banshee scream, welcome to the haunted dream
So beware the witch's lair, step inside if you dare
For tonight the spell won't fade, in this tale where shadows play
All on how we leave, wicked charms and tricks conceived
Ghostly ways they swirl and weave, in the witch's house we believe
