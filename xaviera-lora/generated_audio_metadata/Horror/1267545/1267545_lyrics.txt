In the heart of a foggy wooded moor
There stood a house with a creaky door
Witches gather on Hallows Eve
Casting spells, oh the webs they weave
Spooky shadows, dancing flakes
Whisper softly, chant the names
In the witch's house on Halloween
What lurks within is yet unseen
Pumpkins grinning with an eerie glow
Candlelit faces shadows throw
Black cats hurry with eyes so bright
Silent guardians of the night
Spooky shadows
