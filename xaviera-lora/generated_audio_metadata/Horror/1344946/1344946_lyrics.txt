(Growling)
(Growling)
Eyes are watching from the garden
Cold hands reaching for your heart
Thunder crashes, spirits scream
Welcome to the endless dream
Halloween, the night of fear
Evil whispers draw you near
Screams of terror fill the sky
Run or stay, you'll never hide
Doors are creaking, floors will shake
Demons laughing wide awake
Moonlight bleeding, shadows crawl
Halloween consumes us all
Rise from the dead
The cursed obey
Dance with the night
The lost will stay
Fire and smoke
Oh, the shadows reign
Halloween calls your name
When the nightmares begin
Scream
Scream
