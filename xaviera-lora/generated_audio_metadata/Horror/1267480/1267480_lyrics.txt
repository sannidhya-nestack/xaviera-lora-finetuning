Through the deep dark woods where the shadows creep
Lies a house where the witches weep
Every Halloween Eve the door swings wide
Calling lost souls nowhere to hide
Winds howl through the trees whispering dread
Moonlight's pale glow on the old homestead
The cauldron bubbles with a sinister brew
The witches cackle and the nightmares ensue
Oh, on this spooky Halloween
Where the witch's house can be seen
Ghost goblins dance in the night
Come to the house of eerie fright
Cobwebs hang from ceiling to floor
Old creaky hinges on the broken door
A black cat hisses, eyes glowing bright
In the witch's house on Halloween night
Skeletons rattle and pumpkins grinned wide
Pools in the corners with nowhere to hide
Candles flicker with a spectral flare
Join the macabre if you dare
Oh, on this spooky Halloween
Where the witch's house can be seen
Ghost goblins dance in the night
Come to the house of eerie fright
Midnight strikes on the old grandfather clock
Lock your doors with a sturdy hand
