I'm hollowed out, I'm going quite insane
Just like Ichabod Crane
On shaky ground, I'm wallowing in pain
Just like Ichabod Crane
A heartless soul without control
These thoughts are driving me mad
I'm haunted by a mournful cry
I'm losing what wits I had
I'm hollowed out, I'm going quite insane
Just like Ichabod Crane
On shaky ground, I'm wallowing in pain
Just like Ichabod Crane
In these dark woods, there's nothing good
The whispered wind seems alive
Little Tanties, I'm on my knees
Afraid that I might survive
I'm hollowed out, I'm going quite insane
Just like Ichabod Crane
On shaky ground, I'm wallowing in pain
Just like Ichabod Crane
She led me down a lover's lane
And let my heart bleedin' down the drain
I'm hollowed out, I'm goin' quite insane
Just like Ichabod Crane
On shaky ground, I'm wallowin' in pain
Just like Ichabod Crane
I'm hollowed out
I'm going quite insane
Just like Ichabod Crane
On shaky ground
I'm wallowing in pain
Just like Ichabod Crane
A luckless fool, a fate so cruel
My hopes crushed under her heel
I'm walking dead, a lifeless head
That's too scared to know how it feels
I'm hollowed out, I'm going quite insane
Just like Ichabod Crane
On shaky ground, I'm wallowing in pain
Just like Ichabod Crane
I'm hollowed out, I'm going quite insane
Just like Ichabod Cray
On shaky ground, I'm wallowing in pain
Just like Ichabod Cray
Just like Ichabod Cray
Just like Ichabod Cray
