And in this forsaken globe, our shadows come to grow
Castles standing tall and bleak, secrets they still keep
Through the narrow trees, whispers on the breeze
The echo of the ancient hymn, the ballad of the grim
In the heart of night, thunder specters light
We dance, we sing to the haunting ring
Fearsome yet divine, under the starry shrine
We're lost in the serenade, a masquerade unmade
Boondell stain with stories high, under the cold black sky
Now there's now the masquerade, in elegance array
Feathers lace in silence rain
Moving in the night's domain
Trapped in time the rhythm flows
A melody only night knows
Subdued under velvet skies
We heed the eeriness cries
Unseen forces set the stage
For whispers of an age
The spectral choir starts its hymn
All this seems so grim
We rewonder the moonlight pale
Caught in the night time's tale
In the wonder's lullaby, as we bid the night goodbye
Echoed in the corridors, the lore of yore restores
Washed away by twilight's gleam, it was but a nightmarish dream
For now the dawn breaks high and clear, another day is near
