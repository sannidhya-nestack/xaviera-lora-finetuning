Underneath the moonlight on this all-hallowed eve
Witches flying on broomsticks up their sleeve
Ghosts in the graveyard skeletons in trees
A chilly Halloween that brings you to your knees
Halloween, Halloween, night of trick or treat
Children roaming down the streets
Pumpkins glowing a frightening feat
In the haunted house, vampires take their sleep
Ghouls around the corner, ready to creep
Wear your costume, door to door
Collecting candy to own what's in store
Halloween, Halloween, night of trick or treat
Children roaming down the streets
Pumpkins glowing a frightening fate
In the haunted house vampires take their sleep
Ghouls around the corner ready to creep
Wear your costume door to door
Collecting candy oh what's in store?
Halloween, Halloween of the witchy sight
Spooky figures dance in the night
Jack-o'-lanterns burning bright
With a shiver and thrills under the moon's glow so pale
It's the magical mystical tale of Halloween's veil
Trick or treat echoes at the door
It's the night of fright we all adore
Halloween once more
