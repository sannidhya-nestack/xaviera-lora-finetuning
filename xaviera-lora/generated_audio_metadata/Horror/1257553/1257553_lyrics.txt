Hear the ticking of the clock as Halloween's around the block
Pumpkin crimson candles flick in the chilly autumn bare thick
Skeletons dance and witches fly
Under the midnight moonlit sky
Spooky kooky trick or treat
Steel beat echoes on the street
Halloween, Halloween
Let's delve in the world unseen
Don't be afraid
Come join the scene
It's a marvelously scary dream
Cat's eye blinked
In the shadows gleam
Behind the old twisted tree
Haunted house perched on the hill
Where the night is quiet and still
Ghouls and ghosts come out to play
In the wild delightful disarray
Creepy whispers fill the night
As we stab at ghostly life
Halloween, Halloween, oh what a friendly fight
Join the shadows dancing free
In this haunted melody
Hear the bell's final chime
As we wave goodbye to October's time
The magic fades as dawn arrives
And the day claims its prize
We'll remember Halloween night
Till it returns with spooky delight
Creepy whispers fill the night
As we step in the ghostly light
Halloween, Halloween, oh what a thrilling fright
Join the shadows dancing free
In this haunted melody
In the deep
In this haunted melody
Hear the bell's final chime as we wave goodbye to October's time
The magic fades as dawn arrives and the day claims its prize
We'll remember Halloween night'til it returns with spooky delight
