[howling]
It's Halloween and midnight is soon
Strange clouds cover up the moon
The night is dark, the wind is chill
Creepy things are happening, I can tell
Witches are flying on their brooms
Mummies are stumbling from their tombs
Spiders are crawling, they're everywhere
Hey, I've got spider webs in my hair
Ghosts are rising from their graves
Bats are flying from their caves
Werewolves are howling, spells are being cast
Monsters and zombies are alive at last
Skeletons are dancing in the street
Black cats are hissing at my feet
Shadows are growing, cauldrons are bubbling
Somewhere out there, the blob is dabbling
Vampires are wide awake
There's an eerie fog on the lake
Crones are cackling, potions are being brewed
The Frankensteins are having a family feud
The creatures rising from the black lagoon
Flying saucers are coming from the moon
People are being replaced by pods
Hey, is that hair growing on my back?
Birds are rising from their graves
Bats are flying from their caves
Werewolves are howling, spells are being cast
Monsters and zombies are alive at last
Skeletons are dancing in the street
Black cats are hissing at my feet
Shadows are growing, cauldrons are bubbling
Somewhere out there the blob is dabbling
(howling)
