Halloween is here, time for some spooky cheer
Dress up and smile, there's nothing to fear
Pumpkins glowing, ghosts saying "Boo !"
Candy's waiting just for you
Halloween, Halloween, time for fun
Let's trick or treat under the moon and sun
Halloween, Halloween, it's so neat
Let's go out and collect some sweet treats
Witches on broomsticks, cats all black
Skeletons in closet, ghosts coming back
Spooky, scary, but oh so fun
This Halloween night, let's run and run
Halloween, Halloween, time to shout
Let's dress up and wander about
Halloween, Halloween, don't be shy
Up to the sky, let your spirits fly
Funfire's burning, owls hoot in the night
All Halloween, you're a delight
So put on a mask, let the magic begin
Here comes the night of trick or treating
Halloween, Halloween, time for fun
Let's trick or treat under the moon and sun
Halloween, Halloween, it's so neat
Let's go out and collect some sweet treat
Or chisel, chisel
