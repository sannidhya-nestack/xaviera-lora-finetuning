In the sight where moonlight gleams, it's the spookiest night it seems
Goblins, witches, ombrew flies, we stand in the thrill of the Halloween night
Halloween, Halloween, haunted houses, ghosts unseen
Trick or treat down the street, sugary delights, oh so sweet
Bats and spiders weave their spell
In the glow of the pumpkin shell
Footsteps echo children's delight
Revelling in the mystery of the night
Halloween, Halloween
Costumes worn so fascinating
Candy corn and chocolate bars
Underneath the autumn stars
Whispers in the dark the magic here
Briefest touch of fear yet we cheer
A night of terrors yet we grin
In the captivating dance of Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, the eeriest enchantment ever seen
Lanterns twinkling, spirits soar in the thrill of tales and folklore
Though darkness falls, our spirits rise in the captivating dance of Halloween vibes
As morning calls, we'll remember keen the magical tale of this Halloween
