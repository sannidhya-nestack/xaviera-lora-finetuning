In the shadow of the moon on a Halloween night
A house, the dark void of any light
An old witch resides with a mischievous grin
Brewing her potions, waiting to begin
Oh come ye children and hear the tale
Of a haunted house where witches wail
On Halloween Eve when shadows grow
Wonder not where witches sow
Flickering candles the windows do gleam
Horrors within make the bravest scream
The wind whispers secrets the floorboards creak
Echoes of laughter, ever so bleak, oh
Come ye children and hear the tale
Of a haunted house where witches wail
On Halloween Eve when shadows glow
Wonder not where witches so
Skeletons dance in the pale moonlight
Ghouls and goblins a spine-chilling sight
The clock strikes twelve, a ghostly chime
The witch's spell weaves through time
Jack-o'-lanterns glow with an eerie face
Inviting you to this cursed place
Bats in the belfry, owls in the trees
Beware the witch
Or you'll be pleased
Oh come ye children
And hear the tale of a haunted house where
