Little heart of the ancient wood
Where the moon is built and is sewn
Stands a house so dark and old
Where the witches' tales are often told
Stooky shadows, eerie night
Whisper secrets through the night
Cat-brained laughter, eerie call
On Halloween Eve, beware them all
Codwoods rake from creaking doors
Footsteps echo on the floors
Cauldrons bubble, spells are cast
In this house where shadows last
Spooky shadows, eerie night
Whisper secrets through the night
Cackling laughter, eerie call
On Halloween Eve, beware the maw
Through the windows go sleeping
Latter sticker spirit scheme
Pumpkins grin with jagged teeth
Warding off what's known beneath
Spooky shadows here we light
Whisper secrets through the night
Cackling laughter here we call
On Halloween Eve we wear them all
Through the windows ghostly gleam
Lanterns flicker spirits scheme
Pumpkins grin with jagged teeth
Warding off what's known beneath
Spooky shadows eerie light
Whisper secrets through the night
Cat with laughter eerie call
On Halloween eve beware them all
Witch's cackle fills the air
Potions brewing, legends rare
Black cats lurk and broomsticks fly
the starless dusk
