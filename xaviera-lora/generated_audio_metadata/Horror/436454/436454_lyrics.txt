When midnight comes and daylight goes
You see some of these and some of those
It really keeps you on your toes
You never know what you'll see
It's such a fright to be out at night
There's ghouls and ghosts and wolves that bite
There's lots of fun to be had alright
At the Skeleton Jamboree
Look, they're dancing in a whirl
The skeleton boys and skeleton girls
Look, she's so cute
Oh, I don't know
She looks a little bony to me
Look, the place has come alive
They're all doing the jump and jive
You'd never know that they all died
They're having such fun, you see
Look, old Joe's a bag of sticks
He just popped out to do his tricks
He played fetch with Rex and now
He's missing a bone or three (ruff)
Hello my lady and good day
You have a beautiful vertebrae
I'd love to tickle your ribs today
At the skeleton jamboree (fresh)
We'll pick a rib at a joint tonight
And a couple of beers on me
But we'll still be dry as a bone tonight
It don't stick to your ribs
Ah phooey!
I got a bone to pick with you
You ot to bring the witch's stew
She sat upon my knee
And then straight up in the air she flew
We're in the cemetery lot
Where each one has their own plot
It's quite a mess when one ot
Which belonged to who
We'd like to visit a haunted house
Make no bones about it
But everyone was afraid to go
There might be a ghost inside it
Well now you've seen them jump and jive
But jive don't mind, he's not alive
They crack some skulls and bust some head
It's a good thing they're already dead
Yes now you know how skeletons be
They're all wrapped up in their family tree
They're just skinnier versions of you and me
At the skeleton jamboree
