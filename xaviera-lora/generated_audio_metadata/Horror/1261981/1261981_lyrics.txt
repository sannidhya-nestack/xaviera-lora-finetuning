In the still of the night, midst the whispering pines
A chill in the air where the moonlight dines
Looks can deceive but the shadows know
The secrets buried beneath the hollows glow
Halloween, Halloween, in the dark we convene
In a world unseen where every night's a dream
Dark Chameon's Halloween
Where the ghosts come and feed in the whispers of the wind in the echoes unseen
Wandering souls clothed in desolate
Darkness and the Raven's flight
In this realm of terror on a hollow's night
Halloween, Halloween, fear, solitude not seen
In a haunted serenade, in a melody pristine
Dark chameons, Halloween, a phantasmal scene
Where we embrace the dread in this nocturnal scream
As the clock strikes midnight under the spectral light
We dance with the spirits in the chilling night
In this dark ambient hallway where the ghosts can't be sight
Where fear is the melody and then the night ignites
Hunter's Souls Clothed
