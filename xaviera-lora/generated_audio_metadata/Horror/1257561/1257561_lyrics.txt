Beneath the chilling autumn moon, the night of Halloween looms soon
Jack-o'-lanterns glow in wait, I can hardly anticipate
Halloween, oh Halloween, night of mischief, fun and scream
Kids in costumes, trick or treat, can you hear the ghostly beat?
Riches, monsters roam the street
Candy corn and chocolate sweet
Laughter echoing in the night
Oh what a spooky delight
Halloween, festive Halloween
When the ghoulies are so mean
This one night we come together
In the crisp fall weather
One o'clock strikes the dread hour
Underneath the haunted tower
Spirits dance and goblins play
On this magical, eerie day
Halloween, wonderful Halloween
In your charm, we're all keen
As the night begins to fade
We will wait for your next parade
So'til next year, my dear friend
When the very sweet worlds will bend
Halloween, Halloween
You're the best
We've ever seen
