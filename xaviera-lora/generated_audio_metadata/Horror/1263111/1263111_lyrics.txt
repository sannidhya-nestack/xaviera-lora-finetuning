Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hard in the night where the shadows align
Under the silvery lights of an ominous sign
Merciful whispers of the lost resonate in the dusk
Songs of awful frost wrapped in a husk
Night symphony, momentum so bleak
the corner where phantoms seek
Listen close to the sonorous speak
Of melodies that the lost have heard
Wands leaking'neath cathedral ruins torn
Past ancient lore, cracked bells in the hall
otten their chime and roar
Cold figures gather round
Beneath the moon's cold glow
Their murmured secrets profound
Only the night knows
Tales spun in the cobweb gloom
In the heart of the midnight gloom
Candles flicker inside
Of impending dooms
A otten chance lying in the dust
Intertwined in a haunting dance, feel the chill
