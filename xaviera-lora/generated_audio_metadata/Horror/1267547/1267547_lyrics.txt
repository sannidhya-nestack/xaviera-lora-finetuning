On a night so dark and cold when the moon is full and bold
The witch's house on yonder hill echoes with a fearsome thrill
Magic potions bubble bright, candle flames slither in the night
Ghostly whispers fill the air, in the shadows take great care
Dare you knock upon the door of the witch from Legend's York
On Halloween Eve don't be shy, hear the spirits' mournful cry
Cobwebs hanging, bats take flight
Jack-o-lanterns burning bright
Blackened cat with eyes of green
Prowling on this eerie scene
Through the window peering in
Skeletons with ghastly grins
Colton bubbles thick and black
There's no turning back
Dare you knock upon the door
Of the witch from Legends Yore
On Halloween Eve, don't be shy
Hear the spirits' mournful cry
Waltzing rates in silent sweep
Tales the dead won't let you keep
Underneath the autumn sky
Every breath a chilling sigh
Ruined spells with ancient lore
Witch hath walked this path before
Every year as shadows fall
She answers destiny's dark call
Flying broomsticks cross the moon
Hark into the bed she's crooned
In this house of ghostly fright
Pray to see the morning light
Dare you knock upon the door
Of the witch from Legends Yore
On Halloween Eve
Don't be shy, hear the spirit's mournful cry
When the clock strikes witching hour
Feel the darkling's eerie power
Festive night of ghostly spree
Catch the witch if you dare, tee
