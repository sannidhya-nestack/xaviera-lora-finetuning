In the valley dark and deep
Where the shadows hide and creep
Stands a house with broken glass
One that whispers of the past
Ooh, the witches' house on Halloween
Where the ghosts and ghouls convene
Ooh, on this spooky festive night
All the horrors come to life
Candles flicker, shadows dance
Eyes and windows fixed in trance
Cobwebs hanging from the beams
Echoes filled with children's screams
Through the witches' house on Halloween
Where the ghosts and ghouls convene
Ooh, on this spooky festive night
All the horrors come to light
Creaking doors and howls of fright
Monsters lurking out of sight
In this house of witches' lair
No soul dares to linger there
Pumpkins grin with eerie glow
Winds of terror wildly blow
From the attic to the floor
Haunted secrets evermore
Ooh, the witch's house on Halloween
Where the ghosts and ghouls convene
Ooh, on this spooky festive night
All the horrors come to light
If you hear the witch's song, turn away, don't linger long
For the night is dark and cold, and her stories must be told
