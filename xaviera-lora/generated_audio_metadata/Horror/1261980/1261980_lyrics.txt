Through the shadows, in the dark night
Ghosts are stirring, ready for the fright
Eerie whispers, a chilling sight
On this eve of Halloween's moonlight
Bargained in Halloween, a fearsome scene
Amongst the tombstones, all things unseen
Beneath the veil of the dark moon sheen
Lies the secret of Halloween
As the clock chimes, a night begins to wane
The spirits retreat,'til next they reign
Dark ambient Halloween, a memory ingrained
Until next year when darkness is again unchanged
