Death is calling you, run, taste the phantom, mother is weeping, red blood for her god
Steal the brew with your soul
Death self- ives us
She will mend us
Made in the forest of death
Respect her which is now branches with summer
The blows from these shadows piercing the night
No one will escape the wrong stress
The undead
What beside her is it made of matter?
Eyes so brave and sinking too
Scouts, boiling mad
But links keep crossed their heads
Death reaches for your throat
You're betrayed by death
She composes the commissar
The reaper takes to her grave
Darkness is calling you
Let it take over
But the bruiser witnesses your final place escape
