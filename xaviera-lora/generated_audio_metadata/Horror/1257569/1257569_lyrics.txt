In the dead of the night, when the moon shines bright
In shadows stir up a fearful sight
Haunted houses, carved pumpkins so light
Halloween's here, hold your loved ones tight
Oh Halloween, oh Halloween
Tonight in costumes we convene
Candies to gather, friends to meet
In the witching hour, on this dimly lit street
Witches, goblins, monsters roam
In this ghostly evening hour they foam
Stroke of midnight, a chilled wind blown
In every heart, a fear is sung
Oh Halloween, oh Halloween
Our spirits in the darkness gleam
From door to door, the children scream
In the merry chorus of this spooky theme
Black cats prowling, owls choir hooting
March of the bulls trick or treating
Beware of strangers offering sweets
Oh the frightful fun of how loved ones tight
Oh Halloween, oh Halloween
Beneath the moon's ghostly sheen
In shadows long, their screams unseen
We celebrate the night of Halloween
As the dawn breaks, costumes retire
Disappearing like a fleeting vampire
Halloween, oh Halloween, you inspire
A night of fun, fight, and stories by the fire
