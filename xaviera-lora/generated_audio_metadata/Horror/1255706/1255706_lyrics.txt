It's Halloween, it's Halloween
The best time of the year
Put on your costume, don't be seen
It's time for cheer, not fear
Trick or treat, let's hit the street
With a bag for candy sweet
Ghosts and goblins we will meet
Halloween is oh so sweet
Jack-o'-lanterns shining bright
Glowing in the spooky night
See the bats, oh what a sight
In the cool October night
Trick or treat, smell my feet
Give me something good to eat
If you don't, I won't be beat
I'll just laugh and call it a feat
Halloween, Halloween
Now it's time to head on in
Take off your masks
And let the dreams begin
We've had our fun
Save the candy for a spin
Goodnight Halloween
Can't wait'til you again
Begin
It's Halloween so let's have fun
Time to dress up everyone
Witches, ghosts and baked pumpkins
Halloween night has just begun
Trick or treat up and down the street
Lots of yummy candies to eat
Say hello to everyone we meet
Halloween is oh so sweet
See the moon, it's big and bright
Shining down on this spooky night
Laugh and play, it feels just right
Halloween is such a sight
Trick or treat with happy feet
From door to door as heartbeats beat
With our lanterns all agleam
Happy, happy Halloween
Halloween, night of fun
Now it's over, now it's done
Took off our costumes
Had lots of fun, good night
Halloween
We'll miss everyone
These Wacushas bring Wacots growin' gods sound
Took off our costumes, had lots of fun, summoning a side of fun
Goodnight Halloween, we'll miss everyone
Halloween night of fun, now it's over, now it's done
Took off our costumes, had lots of fun, goodnight Halloween, we'll miss everyone
