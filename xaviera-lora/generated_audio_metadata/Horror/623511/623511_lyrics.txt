The kids were rocking to the rise of the moon
Ready to party at the secret lagoon
The kids were dancing and having fun
Spinning the tunes, banging the drums
The fish were jamming, the crabs were in time
Splashing in the water and dancing in line
From the rocks it started humming a tune
It was the creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
Out from the tide, he started to rise
He buffled and gurgled and opened his eyes
He was grinning from gill to gill
His walk through the party was the biggest thrill
He fish-eyed the chicks, he made his big move
Flopping and popping and bustin' a groove
Pretty soon all the girls were singing his tune
He was the creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon (the disco creature from the black lagoon)
The disco creature from the black lagoon (the disco creature from the black lagoon)
The disco creature from the black lagoon (disco, disco, disco, disco)
Right now you're in a kind of a limbo
It's alive
Since biblical times man has witnessed and recorded strange manifestations (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Are you listening?
Baby, go for it
It's a lie (lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie)
This boy (this may be the biggest thing that's ever happened)
It's a lie (lie, lie, lie)
I do it, I do it
This boy, this boy, this boy, this boy, this boy, this boy
The Disco Creature from the Black Lagoon
The Disco Creature from the Black Lagoon
The Disco Creature from the Black Lagoon
The Disco Creature from the Black Lagoon
The Disco Creature from the Black Lagoon
The Disco Creature from the Black Lagoon
The Disco Creature from the Black Lagoon
The disco creature from the black lagoon (the disco creature from the black lagoon)
The disco creature from the black lagoon (the disco creature from the black lagoon)
The disco creature from the black lagoon (the black lagoon)
He had an awesome sense
He was a slimy guy
With a fish eye
He was so shy-y-y-y
He had a fish eye
He was so green
