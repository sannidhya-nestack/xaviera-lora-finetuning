It's Halloween, time for fun
Bright moon, replace the sun
Pumpkins smiling, eerie light
In the spooky, starry night
Trick or treat, smell my feet
Give me something good to eat
On Halloween, don't be mean
Best day of the year we meet
Ghosts and goblins all around
Witches flying, cats astound
Kids in costumes, big and small
Halloween is fun for all
Candy corn, lollipop, door to door
We won't stop, it's Halloween
Time to bring sweets around'til we drop
Halloween, Halloween, getting ready for the scene
Now it's time, end of rhyme, sleep tight'til the morn's gleam
Trick or treat, smell my feet, give me something good to eat
On Halloween, don't be mean, best day of the year we meet
Ghosts and goblins all around, witches flying, cats astound
Kids in costumes big and small, Halloween is fun for all
Candy corn, lollipop, door to door, we won't stop
It's Halloween, time to glean, sweets all round'til we drop
Candy corn, lollipop, door to door, we won't stop
Candy corn, lollipop
Door to door, we won't stop
Candy corn lollipop
Door to door, we won't stop
Kim's in costumes big and small
Halloween is fun for all
Candy corn lollipop
Candy corn lollipop
Door to door, we won't stop
Candy corn lollipop
Door to door, we won't stop
