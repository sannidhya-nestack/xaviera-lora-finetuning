In the shadow of the steeple where the black bats fly
Upon the ancient an plays a lullaby
Through corridors of cobwebs and portraits with no name
In the castle of otten songs we dance in moon's pale flame
Croonings from the crypt under the lanterns glow
Lost souls in a spectral waltz with the shadows they throw
Badge of the burial grounds etched in chilling dread
In a symphony of silence where even fear has fled
Under wings of midnight
In the forest's haunted heart
The melody weaves a tale
From which dreams depart
Where blazed ballrooms echo

Phantom strange ripples from the spectral valet
A dirge in the darkness, a lament in the light

From the mausoleum's mantle to the gargoyle's glare
The monastery of macabre draped in the shroud of despair
A piano plays softly in the wings of a haunted scythe
Dead roses lace the lyrics of this mournful goodbye
As the raven takes the stage

Under the chandelier of cobwebs
Mystery starts to bloom
A dance in the...
