On Halloween Eve when the moon's gleam is bright
The witch in her house stirs up shadows of night
The wind it does whisper through trees that do creak
As children in costumes play games hide and seek
Spooky, spooky, the moons glow in flight
Witches cackle and howl, oh the spine chilling night
In the shadows they play, in the lanterns dim lights
Oh the tales we do weave on this mystical night
In the forest so deep where the fog does grow thick
Lies a house'neath the spell of her old magic tricks
With cauldrons a-brewing and whispers that from
A cat on the prowl hear the beat of his drum
Spooky, spooky, the moon's glow in flight
Witches cackle and howl, oh, the spine-chilling night
In the shadows they play, in the lantern's dim lights
Oh, the tales we do weave on this mystical night
The windows they rattle from winds cool and chill
As pumpkins do flicker upon the windowsill
The clock strikes the hour and echoes with fright
Beware of the witch on this Halloween night
