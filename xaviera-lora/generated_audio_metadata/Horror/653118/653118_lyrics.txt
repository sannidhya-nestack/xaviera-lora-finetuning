The acrobats fall from the sky like I fell for him (do-do-do-do-do-do)
Ringmaster of Oblivion in the circus of sin (do-do-do-do-do)
To tame his heart I framed lions and eaten fire
Roll up, roll up, yeah
It's never enough, no, no, no
I've done everything for his touch
Ringmaster, courtesan to the king
Countess, as you see me as
Ringmaster, soon in my grasp
Swinging from a trapeze
Says you where I should be
Not knockin' on your door (nah, nah)
Nightly like some freak show whore
Oh, so you want to see me fly, huh?
Well then, have your wish
I'll prove I'm worth it
Roll up, roll up, yeah
Marble in fright
No safety net
Just nails to night rain
Rain Master, put his hand to the clouds
Is that you see me as?
Rain Master, soon in my grasp
So watch me fly (watch me) watch me fly (watch me)
I'll make you love me, watch me fly, oh
I'm falling, falling to the ground
My last sight, a screaming crowd
Finally it's me you're holding
As I lie impaled in the ring that you commanded so well
Like my heart that now beats in hell, hell, oh hell
Ringmaster, courtesan to the grounds
Was all you saw me as
Oh, Ringmaster
Oh, Ringmaster
Oh, Ringmaster
Oh, Ringmaster
