In the heart of the night where shadows fall sway
Beneath the pale moonlight creatures come out to play
Haunted echoes fill the air
Whispering tales of fright
Unsweet spirits dance around
Hidden from sight
Unleash the symphony of night
Let fear take its rightful flight
Through corridors of lost time
Play out the ancient rhyme
On earth the secret's buried deep
Where ghostly sentinels sleep
Baptised in the midnight
You are world both chilling and new
A voice to the whispers of hell
If a three-horse dead stroll
Shrouded in the airy gloom
It's vaulted home, silently tell an impending doom
Through the cobweb-layed stiles, chilly tales are spun
Of Gothic, Greco-Romantics, darkly done
Give voice to the whispers of the night
Let the car o'er incite
Set free the phantoms that dwell within
Let the nocturnal rite begin
Illuminate shadows that strive to deceive
