How many wounded rise
Casting shadows into the eyes
A house on the hill where the witches dwell
A place of legends where stories tell
Come gather round and hear the tune
Of a witch's house beneath the moon
When spirits whisper and ghouls will roam
A haunted place that we call home
Door creaks open, a chilling breeze
Candle lights flicker through the trees
Black cats scatter and owls will call
Inside the house you'll see it all
Come gather round and hear the tune
Of a witch's house beneath the moon
Where spirits will swoop and ghouls will roam
A haunted place that we call home
Pumpkins grin with eerie delight
Shadows dance in the pale moonlight
Something stirs in the midnight hour
Wishing magic in darkened power
Ghosts and goblins play hide and seek
Shinsekai, a haunting trip
Ancient spells in the air they weep
On this eerie ghostly Halloween Eve
Come gather round and hear the tune
Of a witch's house beneath the moon
When spirits whistle and ghouls will roam
A haunted place that we call home
So if you dare, take a stroll
To the spooky house on the knoll
Where Halloween thrills and shuns are bound
A witch's laughter, the only sound
