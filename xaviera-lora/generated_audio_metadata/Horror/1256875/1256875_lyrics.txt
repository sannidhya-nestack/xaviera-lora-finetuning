When the moon is round and the air turns cold, spooky tales of Halloween unfold, ghosts and goblins run around, you can hear the eerie sound
Halloween, Halloween, in the dead of the night
Creepy crawlies causing a fright
Halloween, Halloween, not a soul in sight
Only monsters dancing in the moonlight
Broomsticks fly and pumpkins green
Tonight everything is not what it seems
Laughter and screams fill the air
Trick-or-treaters everywhere
Halloween, Halloween, under the moon's glow
Nothing can scare us, into the darkness we go
Halloween, Halloween, watch the spirits take flight
In this wicked joy of Halloween night
Goodbye Halloween, until next year
We'll wait for you, with excitement and fear
Like a ghost in Colorado known
You can hear the eerie sound in the deadest zone
Halloween, Halloween, not a soul in sight
Only monsters dancing in the moonlight
Broomsticks fly and pumpkins gleam tonight
Everything is not what it seems
Laughter and screams fill the air
Trick-or-treaters everywhere
Halloween, Halloween, under the moon's glow
Nothing can scare us into the darkness we go
Halloween, Halloween, watch the spirits take flight
In this wicked joy of Halloween night
Goodbye Halloween, until next year
We'll wait for you with excitement and fear
Goodbye Halloween, until next year
We'll wait for you with excitement and fear
