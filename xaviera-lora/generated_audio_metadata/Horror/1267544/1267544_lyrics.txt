In a town by noon's bright gaze
Lies a house in misty haze
Witches lair, old and grand
Spooky tales across the land
Creaky floors and shadows deep
Secrets that the night will keep
Candles flicker, whispers glide
Midnight's charm nowhere to hide
On Halloween, the spirits roam
In the witch's house, we're never alone
Cackles echo through the air
Dare you enter if you dare
Black cat's eyes gleaming light
Cauldron bubbles dark as night
Spells are cast with gary glee
Skeletons dance wildly free
Pumpkins grin with wicked smiles
Ghosts appear and line the aisles
Ravens perched on windowsills
Silent watchers I see chills
Unhallowed, beneath the spirit's robe
In the witch's house, you're never alone
Cackles echo through the air
Dare you enter if you dare
Winds do howl and branches sway
Lost souls wander on this day
Through the halls where shadows creep
Witches' secrets buried deep
On Halloween Eve the spirits roam
In the witch's house we're never alone
Cackles echo through the air
Dare you enter if you dare
