In this spooky dark night, there's a sweet delight
Little children trick-or-treating in costumes of fright
Jack-o'-lanterns glowing, eerie laughs echoing
It's Halloween night and the magic's beginning
Halloween, Halloween, full of fun and scream
Witches on broomsticks, ghosts unseen
Don't be afraid, it's just Halloween
Down the haunted streets
Where the goblins meet
There are candies and treats
Oh what a feast
With the boo and the eek
Every door we seek
It's Halloween night
Let's play trick or treat
Halloween, Halloween
Full of fun and scream
Wizards casting spells
Casting myths agleam
Don't be scared
It's only a dream
In the shadows monsters hide
Behind the masks our fears subside
Together hand in hand side by side
In the spirit of Halloween we unite
Halloween, Halloween, full of fun and scream
With costumes, candy, and magical theme
The best night ever, like a dream
Halloween, Halloween, puts on a magical scene
And the moon shines bright on this magical night
Halloween, Halloween, oh what a night you've been
Now it's time to say goodnight
next how-goodnight,'til next Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, puts on a magical scene
As the moon shines bright on this mystical night
Halloween, Halloween, oh what a night you've been
Now it's time to say goodnight,'til next Halloween
