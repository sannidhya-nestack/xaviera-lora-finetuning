The light has fallen
Night time has risen
The voices are calling
I am listening
Come be with me
Come be with me
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I am here and I have a craving
I am your master
It's time for feeding
Until your heart beat faster
I've been longing for you and your love
Sweet like wine
It's time for us to become one
Give me your love
Don't be afraid about it, this song is for real
All I wanna do is die, I'll be there for you, don't leave me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I promise you that this is not an illusion
I will satisfy your hunger
Every need, every wish
You'll be dancing in ballroom of desire
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Let counting take you higher
Higher
Give me your love
Don't be afraid of anything, something surreal
All your desire
The pleasures of this life will be there for you
Come with me
Viens, viens, viens voler avec moi (Viens, viens, viens voler avec moi)
Je te donnerai le monde (Je te donnerai le monde)
Allez, ne pense pas (Allez, allez, ne pense pas)
Tu n'as rien à craindre (Tu n'as rien à craindre)
Viens, viens, viens voler avec moi
