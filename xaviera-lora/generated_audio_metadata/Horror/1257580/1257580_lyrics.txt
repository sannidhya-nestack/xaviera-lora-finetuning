Halloween night under the pale moonlight
Costumes on red for thy dreadful friend
Let's start flying, moons are howling
Everyone's out, the spirits are prowling
Halloween, Halloween, it's all just a scream
We dance with the monsters in our dreadful dream
On this night we let the ghosts play
While we sing and laugh in a spooky way
Pumpkins grinning, children spinning
In this haunted night, it's just the beginning
Candy and frights and delicious scares
In our witchy hats, moving in pairs
Halloween, Halloween, chilling in dream
Witches and ghosts forming a scary scene
In this night, dearest Halloween
We laugh with the ghouls like a terrifying dream
Trick or treat, we step on the cobblestreet
Fear is sweet on this Halloween
The clock strikes twelve, magic takes flight
In the echoes of this Halloween night
Halloween, Halloween, what a pristine sight
Thrilling and chilling, full of delightful fright
Oh Halloween in the pale moonlight
We danced and pranced until the twilight
And next year dear Halloween fright
We bid you goodnight with a soft candlelight
