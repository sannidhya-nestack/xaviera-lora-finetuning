In the burst autumn air when the night falls down
Creepy shadows plague in our little town
Knocking on the doors and costumes kids delight
It's the spooky scary fun filled Halloween night
Halloween, Halloween, lighting up the dark
The night filled with mystery and larks
Candy in bags, children's laughter in pods
Skirtlands rattling, witches on broom flight
Pumpkin heads glow under the moonlight
Chasing the ghosts as they take their flight
Oh what horrors they bring, oh what a sight
Halloween, Halloween, let the magic unfold
With stories yet to be told
And memories of the old
As the night ends and dawn's on the brink
The spell of Halloween fades quicker than a wink
Until next year when the night turns dark
We'll await for the pumped up Halloween spark
Halloween, Halloween, night in the dark
Halloween, Halloween, lighting up the dark
In the night filled with mystery and larks
Candy in bags, children's laughter in parks
Skeletons in rattling pots
Skeletons in rattling pots
