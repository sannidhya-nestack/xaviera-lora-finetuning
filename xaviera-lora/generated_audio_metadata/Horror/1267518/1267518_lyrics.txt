On Halloween Eve in the forest deep
Lies a house where witches creep
Candles flicker, shadows dance
In a place of eerie trance
Welcome to the witch's home
Where shadows and spirits roam
In the night the horror sings
Beware the whispers of dark things
Pumpkin grins and whispers low
Ghostly figures from long ago
Creaking doors and rattling chains
Echoes of the witch's reign
Welcome to the witch's home
Where shadows and spirits roam
In the night, the horror sings
Beware the whispers of dark things
Spider webs and potion brews
Moonlight weaves a fearsome muse
Cloaked in black they cast their spells
Stories only graveyards tell
Mystic winds through skeletal trees
Carrie cries on haunting breeze
Face your fears but tread with care
