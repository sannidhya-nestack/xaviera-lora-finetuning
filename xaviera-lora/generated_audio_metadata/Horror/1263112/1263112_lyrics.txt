In a realm as black as night
Where the shadows whisper fright
Under the spectral moonlight's glare
Silhouettes dance in the cool night air
Shrouded figures form dumb like a ballet
Through haunting symphony
Shadows sashay in a waltz of whispers
They sway in the dead heart of night
Where horrors lay
Stone walls echoing with chilling cheers
A symphony of fear that every phantom hears
The sounds of the dead so loud and clear
A serenade of souls in your ear
Hymns on the wind as cold as stone
As the graveyard plays its morbid tone
In the spectral theatre darkness has grown
In this cavernous cathedral the shadows moan
