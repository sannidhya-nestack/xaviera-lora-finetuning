Every year at Halloween, horrifying sights are seen
On a street called Nightmare Lane
If you don't follow my advice, you're gonna pay a heavy price
You'll only have yourself to blame
When pumpkin time arrived last year, I had some friends who disappeared
Because they had to take a look
As they walked down that dead end street
To the sounds of children's trick or treat
By then their little goose was cooked
Nightmare Lane, Nightmare Lane
Cover up your eyes or you might go insane
Tonight is Halloween when monsters do their thing
Stay away from Nightmare Lane
It's wrong for me to tell you this
But if you really do insist
I'll just give you one small clue
Give me the candy in your sack
You probably won't be coming back
So it won't be of use to you
It's two blocks over to the right
In the misty pale moonlight
That's where you'll hear a werewolf howl
And though you fight with all your might
I see fingers hold on tight
So beware of vampires on the prowl
Like a moth drawn to a flame
You'll never be the same
Those heebie-jeebie-gees
Will bring you to your knees
A witch may capture you
And add you to her stew
If you go down nightmare lane
Nightmare Lane, Nightmare Lane
Cover up your eyes or you might go insane
Tonight is Halloween when monsters do their thing
Please don't go down Nightmare Lane, oh
Nightmare Lane, Nightmare Lane
Cover up your eyes or you might go insane
Tonight is Halloween when monsters do their thing
Please don't go down nightmare lane
Oh please don't go down nightmare lane
