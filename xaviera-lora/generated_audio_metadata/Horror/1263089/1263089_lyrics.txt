In the darkest night, underneath the crooked trees
Sits a haunted house, whispering in the eerie breeze
Spiders weave their webs, a creepy creaking sound
Something's lurking there, in the shadows all around
Trick and treat in the silent street
Ghosts and goblins are who you meet
Witches brew their magic gold
In a chilling night so cold
Clock strikes midnight
It's the witching powers peak
Pumpkins glow bright
As the wind begins to speak
Bats fly across the moon
In the October sky
Scarecrow stand guard
As restless spirits sigh
Trick and treat in the silent street
Beware of the undead you might meet
Candles flickering skeletal heads
Echoing laughs'cross the haunted lands
In the amber glow
Spirits begin to dance
Gothic figures twirl entranced in a macabro romance
A chilling symphony played on phantom keys
Where songs through the ages stirring tales of mystery
Trick and treat in the silent street
Ghosts and goblins are who you meet
Witches prove their magic gold
In the chilling night so cold
Beneath the starless sky
And the shadowed lunar light
Halloween's enchantment holds the eerie night
In this spectral walls and the chilling ghostly sights
And so we retail, sealed with Halloween delights
