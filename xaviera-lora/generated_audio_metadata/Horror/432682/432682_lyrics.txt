There once was a skeleton knocking on my door
Knock knock knock
Who is there?
I am a skeleton trick or treat
Do you have any candy to eat?
There once was a mummy knocking on my door
Rack rack rack
Who is there?
I am a mummy, trick or treat
Do you have any candy to eat?
I gave sour balls to the skeleton
I gave the mummy M &Ms
There once was a witch knocking on my door
Knock, knock, knock
Who is there?
I am a witch trick or treat
Do you have any candy to eat?
There once was a vampire knocking on my door
Uh uh uh
Who is there?
I'm a vampire to suck your blood
Do you have any milk duds?
I gave the witch some candy canes
I gave the vampire chocolate brains
I ran out of candy to eat
Now it's my turn to trick or treat
