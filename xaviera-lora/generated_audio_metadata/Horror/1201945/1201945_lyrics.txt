Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Revive, die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
I'd pray the Lord my soul to take
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord I'll search you keen
Pray thank God before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Wait by the door before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Darling, dear, don't you sleep
Pray the Lord, our soul to keep
If I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
