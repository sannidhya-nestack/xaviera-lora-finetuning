On a night so eerie'neath the moon's pale light
We tread through the shadows in the gloom of twilight
To a witch's house on a crooked path
Where spirits do whisper and the old oak laughs
In the witch's house where the ghosts do play
On Halloween Eve come dance and sway
With a cackle and a spell in the midnight air
A spooky ball, all are welcome there
In the pumpkin glow,'neath the weeping willow
We hear a banshee cry from a misty hillock
A cauldron bubbles with a fragrant brew
Black cats purr and the broomsticks flew
In the witch's house where the ghosts do play
On Halloween Eve come dance and sway
With a cackle and a spell in the midnight air
A spooky ball, all are welcome there
Skeletons rattle in a ghostly dance
Vampires sip from a crystal stance
Cobwebs draped in grand display
As we chant and sing'til the break of day
In the witch's house where the ghosts do play
On Halloween Eve come dance and sway
With a cackle and a spell in the midnight air
A spooky ball, all are welcome there
