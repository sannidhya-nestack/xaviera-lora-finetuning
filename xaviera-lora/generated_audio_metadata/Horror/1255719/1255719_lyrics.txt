Oh, it's Halloween, it's Halloween
Time for fun, nothing mean
See the pumpkins, see the bats
Watch out for the playful cats
Halloween, oh Halloween
Full of treats and lots of scream
Tricks or treats, up and down
Through the streets of our town
Spiders, ghosts, and witches fly beneath the dark spooky sky
The little ghouls and masks don't need running fast from street to street
Halloween's me Halloween, scary happy in between
Candy bags flow so bright in the soft moonlight night
Now we say our sweet goodnight till next year's Halloween flight
Dream of candy, dream of fun, Halloween night is all done
Halloween, oh Halloween
Halloween, oh Halloween
Full of treats and lots of screams
Chicks are treats up and down
Chicks are treats up and down
Through the streets of our town
Halloween, oh Halloween
Halloween, Halloween
Spiders, ghosts, and witches fly beneath the dark spooky sky
Little ghouls in masks so neat, running fast from street to street
Halloween, sweet Halloween, scary happy in between
Candy bags full so bright in the soft moonlit night
Now we say our sweet goodnight till next year's Halloween flight
Dream of candy, dream of fun, Halloween night is all done
