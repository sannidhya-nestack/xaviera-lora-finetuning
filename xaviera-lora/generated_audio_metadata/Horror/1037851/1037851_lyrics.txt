It was Halloween night when a witch flew by on her broom
Then the dogs in the neighborhood all started howling in tune
The cemetery started to glow like hazardous waste
All of a sudden there were ghouls all over the place
And they did the shuffle
They did the zombie shuffle (they did the zombie shuffle)
You take two steps, stumble around
Give a blank stare and make a zombie sound
Stick out your arms, hope they stay on
Make a shaky turn and keep moving on
Doing the shuffle
Doing the zombie shuffle
Well all the ghosts and goblins and freaks were digging those ghouls
Frankenstein said to the mummy they are way too cool
Mummy they are so cool
The boogie man yelled I want a boogie could you show me how
Okay
They said act like you're dead but make sure you don't fall down
And they did the shuffle (they did the shuffle)
They did the zombie shuffle (the zombie shuffle)
You take two steps, stumble around
Give a blank stare and make a zombie sound
Stick out your arms, hope they stay on
Make a shaky turn and keep moving on to the shuffle
Doing the zombie shuffle
They partied all night'til Dracula broke the bad news
I've got such bad news
He said the sun's coming up as the ghosts all shouted their boos
Woo! Woo!
The spookfest was over but the ghouls had bigger plans
We may be dead but we're not stupid
They spread out and conquered the world with a brand new dance
You take two steps, stumble around
Give a blank stare and make a zombie sound
Stick out your arms, hope they stay on
Make a shaky turn and keep moving on
Doing the shuffle, doing the shuffle
Doing the zombie shuffle, zombie shuffle
