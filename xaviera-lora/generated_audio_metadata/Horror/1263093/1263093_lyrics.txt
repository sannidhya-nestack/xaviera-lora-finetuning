On the stroke of midnight's bell
In the realm where shadows dwell
Underneath the ghastly glow
Among secrets only spectres know
We speak in rhymes of ancient lore
In the moonlight we explore melancholic melodies
Upon the chilling breeze
In this realm of haunting harmonies
Through the maze of haunted halls
Echoing with phantom calls
In the whispering of the leaves
Each tale the darkness weaves
A nocturnal serenade
Woven in the eerie glade
Of ghostly walls in silence played
In the heart of night, fear is swayed
In the twilight and the moons of glow
A timeless dance, a spectral show
In the veil of the night, under a star's rewrite
We embrace the enchanting cold of midnight
And as dawn breaks, the egg goes way
Silencing the nocturnal strain
Yet in the heart of the moonlit dell
Remains the tale, only shadows tell
