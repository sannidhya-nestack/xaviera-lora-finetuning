Boo boo it's Halloween night
Spooky creatures are out of sight
Pumpkins glow with eyes so bright
Underneath the full moon's light
Trick or treat, smell my feet
Candy is so sweet to eat
We're all dressed up, street to street
On Halloween there's no defeat
Friendly witches, broomstick flight
Skeletons dancing left to right
Fairies twinkle, ghosts take flight
All on Halloween night
Trick or treat, smell my feet
Candy is so sweet to eat
We're all dressed up street to street
On Halloween there's no defeat
As we laugh and we play
Wave goodbye, it's a Halloween day
But don't you weep, don't you fray
Because it'll be back, it's always this way
Trick or treat, smell my feet
Candy is so sweet to eat
We're all dressed up, street to street
On Halloween there's no defeat
As we laugh and we play
Wave goodbye to Halloween day
But don't you weep, don't you fray
Because it'll be back, it's always this way
