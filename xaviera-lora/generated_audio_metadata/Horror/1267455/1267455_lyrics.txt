Gathering on Halloween night,'neath the moon's evening light
Sits a house of witches deep, where the shadows slither and creep
Beware, beware on Halloween eve, in the witch's house none leave
With horror music in the air, simple festive spikes of scare
Cobbled doors and windows high
Creaky floorboards, whispers sigh
Candles flicker, spirits wail
In the gloom, the colors pale
Beware, beware on Halloween Eve
In the witch's house none leave
With horror music in the air
Simple festive sprites of scare
Howlish laughter, cackles loud
In the yard, a ghostly crowd
Jack-o'-lanterns, eyes agleam
In this house of Halloween
Potions bubbling, broomsticks fly
Black cats prowl with glowing eyes
Gather round and you shall see
The witches' spell of mystery
Beware, beware on Halloween Eve
In the witch's house none leave
With horror music in the air
Simple festive spikes of scare
As the midnight hour draws near
The witch's laughter fills with cheer
Beware of her deceit
In her house your fears you'll meet
