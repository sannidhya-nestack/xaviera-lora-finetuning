Me no me to be you
Me no me to be you
Me no me to be you
Me no me to be you
Me no me to be you
Me no me to be you
The comic books, it's the comic books
To be praised in what we keep of dark things
To be praised in what we must
Is from mortal sins
To be praised in what we keep of dark things
To be praised in what we must
Is the hope of speed
The same dreams you'll see again
