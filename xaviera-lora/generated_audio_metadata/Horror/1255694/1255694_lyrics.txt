Halloween is here! Let's jump and cheer! With pumpkins round and costumes queer! We knock on doors and call out clear! Trick or treat! Do not fear!
Halloween, Halloween, so much fun
Candy and costumes for everyone
Ghosts and goblins are on the run
Underneath the bright moon sun
We see a house, so big and white
We all approach with pure delight
The door creaks open, what a sight
Yummy treats in the spooky night
Halloween, Halloween, let's not hide
Join in the fun, come outside
Witches and wizards side by side
In this magical mystery ride
So let's say wow, it all on light
Enjoy this magical Halloween night
Don't be scared, hold on tight
Happy Halloween, say it right
Halloween, Halloween, so much fun
Candy and costumes for everyone
Ghosts and goblins are on the run
Underneath the bright moon sun
We see a house, so big and white
We all approach with pure delight
The door creaks open, what a sight
Yummy treats in the spooky night
Halloween, Halloween, let's not hide
Join in the fun, come outside
Witches and wizards side by side
In this magical mystery ride
So let's see mouth with all our might
Enjoy this magical Halloween night
Don't be scared, hold on tight
Happy Halloween, say it right (soak)
Goodbye, now it's time to sleep
Memories of Halloween they'll keep
Close their eyes, count the sheep
Dream of Halloween, oh so deep
