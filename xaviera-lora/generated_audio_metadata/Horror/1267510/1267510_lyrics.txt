In the shadow glint of the pumpkin's gleam
Is a house that haunts the midnight dream
Coloured in cobwebs of our sight
It beckons lost souls on Halloween night
Witches cackle in the moon's eerie glow
Candles flicker as the wind softly blows
Step inside if you dare to the witch's glare
Where spoken fright fill our evening air
Bats in the belfry with a sinister flight
Ghosts in the hallways whispering might
Cauldrons bubbling with potions of dread
Skeletons dance with the tales of the dead
Witches cackle in the moon's eerie glow
Candles flicker as the wind softly blows
Step inside if you dare to the witch's lair
Where spook and fright fill the evening air
Witches cackle in the moon's eerie glow
Candles flicker as the wind softly blows
Step inside if you dare to the witch's lair
Where spook and fright fill the evening air
Bad cats purr with an ominous tune
Jack-o'-lanterns grin beneath the harvest moon
Spirits call from the ancient twisted trees
On Halloween Eve, beware the witches please
Chilling laughter echoes through the night
Eyes in the dark with them the level and light
Follow the path of the old crooked fence
To the witch's house where the fear is intense
The witches cackle and the moon's eerie glow
Candles flicker as the wind softly blows
Step inside if you dare to the witch's lair
Where spook and fright fill the evening air
So heed the whispers of the fallen leaves
On all Hallows Eve when the witch deceives
For once you enter the abode of fright
You'll be lost in the ghostly Halloween night
