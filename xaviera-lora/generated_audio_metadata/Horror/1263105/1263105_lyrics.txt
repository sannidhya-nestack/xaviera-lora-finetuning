In the heart of the silent night
Where ghosts come out to play
Hear the haunts move on
Trash shadows hold us where we can't leave
Echo of laughter, it's still all the way
It's infinity
In the realm of the spectral where terror sings the tales
Under the ghostly cloak where reality truly pales
The rhythm of fear like ancient myths unfold
Beware the bone chilling truth you ought to behold
Your hassle stands dark under the obsidian sky
Behind the masquerade the spirits lie
Sensing the eerie theme
Welcome to the whisper nightmare
The book test Halloween tree
Push the spectral orchestra in the silence they breed dread
In the dance of the departed, a mortal feat feared to tread
Each dreadful note carries a chilling blow
Beware the sirens call from the abyss below
