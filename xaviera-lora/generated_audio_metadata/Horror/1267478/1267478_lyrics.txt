Underneath the moon's pale glow
In a forest where the shadows grow
Stands a house, old and grand
Deep within the haunted land
Of those liquor in the night
In the windows, eerie light
Carports dance in chilly breeze
Whispers float among the trees
Oh, the witch house stands alone
Wicked secrets it has sewn
On this Halloween-y night
Join us for our ghostly fright
Jack-o'-lanterns guard the gate
Spirits rise and spectres wait
Chimney smoke curls in the air
Creaking doors and mold beware
Chanting sounds and cackles loud
Thunder cracks a darkened shroud
Cauldron bubbles, potions brew
Broomsticks sweeping, witches flew
All the witchcraft stands alone
Wicked secrets it has sewn
On this Halloween-y night
Join us for a ghostly fright
Skeletons and ghastly ghosts
Join the witches as their hosts
Mirror shows a young lost soul
Once was sunny now so cold
Rattling chains and eerie moans
Gravestones where the pale moon shone
Haunted tales from ages past
Spooky spells are being cast
Oh, the witch house stands alone
Wicked secrets it has sewn
On this Halloween Eve night
Join us for a ghostly fright
Jack-o'-lanterns guard the gate
Spirits rise, inspectors wait
Chimneys, smoke curls in the air
Creaking doors and old beware
Chanting sounds and cackles loud
Thunder cracks a darkened shroud
Cauldron bubbles, potions brew
Broomsticks sweeping, witches flew
Skeletons and ghastly ghosts
Join the witches as their hosts
Mirror shows a young lost soul
Once was sunny now so cold
Rattling shrieks and eerie moans
Gravestones where the pale boots show
Haunted tales from ages past
Spooky spells are being cast
Oh the witchcraft stands alone
Wicked secrets it has sewn
On this Halloween eve night
Join us for a ghostly fright
As the midnight hour draws near
Every heartbeat hints at fear
Witching hour, cast your spell
