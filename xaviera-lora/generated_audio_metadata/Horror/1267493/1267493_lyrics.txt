Upon the misty moor tonight
An airy glow, a ghostly light
Where shadows creep and whispers sigh
Beneath the witch's midnight sky
A haunted house on Devil's Lane
You'll hear the creak, the moan, the bang
With windows dark and doors that weep
A spellbound secret it does keep
Ooh, Halloween
The witches chant, the goblins scream
Ooh, Halloween
The spookiest night you've ever seen
The roof of thatched, the walls of stone
An ancient curse that chills the bone
Jack-o'-lanterns stare with vacant eyes
As bats and ravens fill the skies
The winged it wails through crooked eaves
