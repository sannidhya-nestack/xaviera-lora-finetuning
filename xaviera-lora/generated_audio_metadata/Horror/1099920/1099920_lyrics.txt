At midnight there's that chilling bell
That wakes those wicked souls from hell
After all this time you know damn well
To hide from their malicious spell
Foolish goblins from the grave
Emerge to party and to rage
Mephistophelion spawned, we'll dance till first shards of the dawn
Halloween party for the damned, manned by an eerie werewolf band
With vampires singing, everybody jammed and drank the blood of a headless man
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
The awful dragging of the chains
By gory ghostly sad remains
And skeletons that have no brains
That walk the frosty narrow lane
There's witches flying through the air
A tainted priest who has no hair
When morning comes they won't be there
To face the chill of the sunlight's glare
Halloween party
For the damned, man by an eerie werewolf band
With vampires singing, everybody jammed
And drank the blood of a headless man, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Halloween party for the damned
Manned by an eerie werewolf band
With vampires singing
Everybody jammed and drank the blood of a headless man, oh, oh
Halloween party for the damned
Manned by an eerie werewolf band
With vampires singing
Everybody jammed and drank the blood of a headless man, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
