Darkness folds across the land as the spooky night has ended
The rain peels down, oh so bright, ready for the Halloween night
Pumpkins sit on every porch underneath the haunted porch
Costumes ready, candy's near, it's the season of Halloween
Spookiest time of the year is Halloween, it's Halloween
A night not for the faint and mean
We trick, we treat, they dare to scare
Creeping under the moon's glare
Witches fly on their broom
Disappearing in the gloom
Cats are black and bats take flight
In the chill of the Halloween night
Ghosts and goblins come to play
In the eerie pale moon rays
Haunted houses echo screams
In the night where nothing's as it seems
It's Halloween, it's Halloween, a night
Full of love and keen
So dance and shout with all your might
In the joy of the Halloween night
Pumping smiles light the way
We bid goodbye to the spooky play
As dawn breaks and creatures withdraw
Remember the magic of the night we saw
And that's the night of Halloween
The most enchanting night you've ever seen
So'til next year let's keep it keen
Happy Halloween
The simple Halloween
The most enchanting night you've ever seen
So'til next year let's keep it keen
Happy Halloween
In the dark under the moon's eerie light
Creepy shadows dance in the Halloween night
While spooky creatures come out to play
Scaring bears all away
The most enchanting night you've ever seen
So'til next, keep it keen
Happy Halloween
It's Halloween, it's time for the light
More creepy tales and fearful fright
Grab your masks, gather near
Halloween night is finally here
Howling winds in the owl's hoot, marching skeletons in pursuit
Across the whispering field they roam, on this night they call home
As the night fades, dawn breaks near, cherishing the laughs and the fear
next year we hold it dear, the magical night of Halloween's cheer
