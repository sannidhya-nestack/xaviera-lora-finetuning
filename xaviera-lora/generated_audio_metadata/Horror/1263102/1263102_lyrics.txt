In stillness of night,'neath the moon ghostly white
A mansion abandoned, its shutters slatted
Hallways that echo with whispers of shadow
Tales that fright in the dead of the night
Hear the bells toll while the dark winds blow
In the raven's flight beneath the pallid light
In this
A quiet obsession, a haunting melody
In the heart of eternity
In cobwebbed corners and frigid borders
Phantoms fade, they're past the rain
In crypts otten where the air tastes rotten
Echoes of despair hanging heavy in the air
Sealed behind the gate, it's a chained fate
In the ghostly gloom of this year
