In the shadow on the full night just before it strikes the mid
There's a whisper in the cool night, Halloween is near, God forbid
On the streets there ain't no passage, lanterns glow'neath the lid
Coolest laughter and hearing message, Halloween has something hidden
Halloween, heathen Halloween
In the night where nothing is what it seemed
Monsters roaming, witches are screaming
In the night of the Halloween
Eyes are glowing in the darkness
Jack-o-lanterns all alight
Children masked in eerie starkness
Their joyful screams fill the night
Candy bags and twisted pleasure
Tricks they play with sheer delight
Roaming door to door at leisure
Under Halloween's strange sights
Halloween, Halloween
In the night where nothing is what it seemed
Monsters roaming, witches are screaming
In the night of the Halloween
As the night is slowly fading and the dawn begins to gleam
In their beds the children waiting through sweet dreams of Halloween
Halloween, oh Halloween, a night of trick and delightful treat
A strange night that's always fleeting until we again meet
Halloween, Halloween
In your dreams where nothing is as it seemed
The watchers sleeping, witches are dreaming
Until the next Halloween
