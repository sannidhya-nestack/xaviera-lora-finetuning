In the shadows of the night where the moon gleams bright
There's a crooked little house bathed in ghostly light
In the heart of the woods past the old oak tree
Lives a witch so wicked with a cackling spray
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
They're the witch's house on Halloween Eve
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She's brewing potions while the spirits weave
Her windows are cracked with a haunted creak
The floor's all grown and the corners leak
Cobwebs hang like curtains in the dark
And her cauldron bubbles with a ghostly spark
Ooh, they're the witch's house on Halloween Eve
Ooh, she's brewing potions while the spirits weave
Black cats prowl with a silent gait
And the owls in the night, oh too late
There's a chill that dances in the air
As children whisper, "Do you dare?"
Ooh, they're the witch's house on Halloween Eve
Ooh, she's brewing potions while the spirits weave
So if you wander down that haunted lane
And you hear her laugh, echo through the rain
Run as fast as you can, don't delay
For the witch's spells may catch you and you'll stay
