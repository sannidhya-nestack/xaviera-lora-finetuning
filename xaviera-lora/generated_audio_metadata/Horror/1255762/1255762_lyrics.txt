It's time for Halloween, oh what a sight
Ghosts and goblins out in the night
Punkies smiling bright under the moonlight
It's time for Halloween, oh what a delightful fright
Halloween, Halloween, fun and a scream
Dress in your costume like a king or a queen
Trick or treat around with your shiny lantern gleam
Halloween, Halloween, isn't it a dream?
Look at the witch flying in the sky
And there's a black cat hissing, oh my
Can you hear the owl hooting up high?
It's time for Halloween, let out a joyous cry
Halloween, Halloween, fun and scream
Collecting lots of candies, oh what a theme
When the night is over you'll sleep in a happy dream
Halloween, Halloween, you remember the gleam
So gather your friends, sing this tune
Wishing you a Halloween that makes you swoon
With lots of laughter under the big bright moon
We'll meet again next Halloween, oh so soon
Halloween, Halloween, fun and scream
Dress in your costume like a king or a queen
Trick or treat around with your shiny lantern gleam
Halloween, Halloween, isn't it a dream?
Look at that witch flying in the sky
And there's a black cat hissing, oh my
Can you hear the owl hooting up high
It's time for Halloween, let out a joyous cry
Look at that witch flying in the sky
And there's a black cat hissing, oh my
Can you hear the owl hooting up high
It's time for Halloween, let out a joyous cry
