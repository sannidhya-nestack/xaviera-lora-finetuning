In the heart of silence
Creeping shadows for your light
Punching faces, craving for light
Howling whispers, cannot hide
Dark, tallowing, the seeds so ripe
In this dark ambient alchemy dream
Spectral figures in the mist
Eyes that blink, lips that gist
Pretty footsteps on old wood
Something's lurking in the hood
Dark ambient alchemy
It's hail so ugly
Haunting echoes from the unseen
Games beyond the world, all so bleak
In this dark ambient Halloween scene
Silence falls as the night unwinds
Whispering secrets of all kinds
Dark ambient Halloween comes to an end
next year my spectral friend
