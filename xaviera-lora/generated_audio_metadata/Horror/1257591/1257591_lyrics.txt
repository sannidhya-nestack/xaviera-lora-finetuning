Creeping through the shadows underneath the moonlight
Unseen, unheard in the chill of the spooky night
Witches on their brooms laughing in delight
Ghosts and ghouls roaming, it's a scary sight
Halloween, Halloween, night of the fight
Masks and costumes in every street light
Jack-o-legends grin with a fearsome light
Halloween, Halloween, oh what a night
Haunted houses squeaking, cobwebs rolling tight
Black cats prowling under the pumpkin light
Candy wrappers rustling in the children's sight
Skeletons are dancing in the graveyard left and right
Halloween, Halloween in the eerie night
Trick or treat ringing out in the cold moonlight
In every shadow it's a new eerie sight
Halloween, Halloween feel the spooky might
As dawn replaces night and fear is out of sight
We wave goodbye until next year's fright
Halloween, Halloween with the final rooftop light
Sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite
On the still of the night, under the pale moonlight
Creatures of the shadow start their eerie flight
Doors are creaking, owls are peaking
Tonight's the night of Halloween speaking
Halloween, Halloween, no need for fright
Candy corn and laughter fill the moonlight night
Pumpkin faces all alight, what a sight
Halloween, Halloween, darkness takes flight
Whispers in the wind, echoes in the night
In the haunted grove, under the lantern light
Ghosts are dancing gaily, witches take their flight
Skeletons are rattling in the pale moonlight
Halloween, Halloween, full of delightful fright
Costumes and candies under neon light
Trick or treat echoes in the breezy night
Halloween, Halloween ends when dawn takes flight
As the night fades away with the early daylight
We say goodbye until next Halloween's twilight
Dream of candy costumes and a ghostly night
Until we meet again in the moonlight's light
