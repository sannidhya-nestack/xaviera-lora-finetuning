In the moon's pale glow
The shadows dance
On all Hallows' Eve, our eerie romance
The witch's house on the edge of town
Rats the night in a ghostly gown
Candles flicker with a luminous spark
Beckoning all to the haunted dark
Spiderwebs in the old oak tree
Whisper secrets of what is to be
Ooh, the witch's cackle, a chilly serenade
Ooh, in her cauldron, dark spells made
Black cats prowl with eyes of green
Watch the halls where phantoms happen
Through the windows peek inside
Ghosts and goblins can't seem to hide
Ooh, the wind howls through the crumbling walls
Ooh, as the darkness of a rolling frost
Pumpkins grinning with sinister smiles
Lying the path of twisted miles
Creaking boards and whispers low
What secrets does the old house know?
Shadows play with the spectral grace
In this time- otten place
From the attic to the haunted well
Each corner holds its tale to tell
Ooh, come gather round and meet
