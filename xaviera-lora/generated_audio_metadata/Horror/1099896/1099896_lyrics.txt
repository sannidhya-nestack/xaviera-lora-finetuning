The Halloween song for boys and ghouls
By pumpkin light they'll see you drool
A skeleton never looked so cool
Eating bats blood mixed with witches' gruel
The undead will join your ghostly song
In the darkness where they now belong
For the gravestones cannot hold them long
When they hear our spooky Halloween song
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh
They say it's nearly Halloween
I've found something to make you scream
A bowl of yellow frog ice cream
Now isn't that a lovely dream
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh
I'll move, I'll move, I'll move
The Halloween song for boys and ghouls
By pumpkin light they'll see you drool
A skeleton never looked so cool
Eating bats blood mixed with witches' gruel
The undead will join your ghostly song
In the darkness where they now belong
For the gravestones cannot hold them long
When they hear our spooky Halloween song
Ah-woo, ah-woo, ah-woo, ah-woo
Ah-woo, ah-woo, ah-woo, ah-woo
