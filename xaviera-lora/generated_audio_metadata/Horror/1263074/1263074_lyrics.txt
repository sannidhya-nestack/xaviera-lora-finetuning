In the gloom of the dust beneath the pewter skies
A silhouette does dances where the old castle lies
Chimera of the night under the opal moon
Playing spectral symphonies that whispers and croons
I come to watch the stars where the shadows lead
Whispers of long lost souls in the air ever creamed
A valet of ghosts, an hour of the damned
In this eternal Sabbath, a masquerade unplanned
Stellar solitude echoes through the halls
Veil of cobwebs sways as the nightfall calls
Voices from the crypt harmonize in despair
Morning in a cadence caught in the icy air
Bask in the spectral glow of a jack-o-lantern's grin
In this realm where solace is found only within
A requiem of ravens in the eerie tapestry unwind
Through the wildest work of day
Of the damned in this eternal Sabbath
Of a loveless decree
In this grand eerie ensemble
Where silent echoes flare
A dance with death unfolds in cold midnight air
Under the veil of darkness
We find our solace here
In the heart of the tempest where we disappear
Disappear, disappear
