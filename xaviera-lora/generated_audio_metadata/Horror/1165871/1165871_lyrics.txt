Shall tell where we are
We're in the most extreme and utter region of the human mind
A dim subconscious underworld
A radiant abyss where men meet themselves
I don't understand it, how
We're in hell, I thought
You loved me, you hated me, completed me
As long as I obeyed you, as long as I served like you deserved it
You brought me here to suck and to save brains
Who are those two? What the fuck is wrong with you?
Why looking in your eyes I say? Case of desire?
Ready the front seat
It's just a man with brain
And not afraid to be a good girl
You came closer in terror I fled from you
You screamed my name while chasing me
And I fell hard as you knocked me off
I tried but no sound would leave this cursed place
As I beg to stop your violation I feel death is closing in
In this moment I swear to you and all to come
This must be your grave

Look at this fucked up shit, jeez, what happened here
You suffered by force, even abusing me
But you needed to repent, I'll show you what virginity means
One may just claim and pay for your sin with spirit
The sword of your suffering will never end
And no one entering the room will be invited to explain
What justice means
I rip your eyes, lift your locks, break your jaw, break your legs
The opium, the opium, and I fuck you up and no one cares
Your death was your fault, now I will drink for you
I turn this place into a scarred place of rot
Ashes come in two pieces, I swear I'll never rest until you all die
If you enter my room, I'll welcome you to my killing season
Voivals to your own nightmare
I haunt you, I hate you
You fear me, betrayed me, I let you bleed
It's my galaxy son
