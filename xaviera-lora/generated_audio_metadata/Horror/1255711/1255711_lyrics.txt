Halloween, Halloween, it's a spooky night
Costumes on, lanterns bright, oh what a sight
Candy here, candy there, candy everywhere
Say trick or treat, you'll get your share
Halloween, Halloween, such a fun-filled scream
Pumpkins glowing, moonlight beaming, it's like a dream
Halloween, Halloween, oh let's make a scene
With lots of laughs in between on this spooky Halloween
Oh, ghosts and ghouls, witches too, all are out to play
In our costumes we rule on this Halloween day
We laugh and smile, run a mile all along the way
Halloween, Halloween, oh what a day
Halloween, Halloween, such a fun-filled scream
Pumpkins glow and moonlight beaming, it's like a dream
Halloween, Halloween, oh let's make a scene
With lots of laughs in between on this spooky Halloween
Also here's a cheer far and near for this Halloween night
Filled with joy without fear and lots of delight
Halloween, Halloween, it's time to say goodnight
See you next year bright and clear for another spooky sight
