I've been a little edgy, I'm losing my heart
A skeleton who's desperate'cause he's missing some parts
A case could be made that I've lost my mind
there's a lot of bones that I need to find
I need bones, skeleton bones
I need bones, skeleton bones
I got a key for my closet but I got no arms
I'm losing my grip and it's causing alarm
I try to be careful but they just disappear
I got a bone to pick if I could find one near
I need bones, yeah, skeleton bones
I need bones
Skeleton bones, I need bones
Come on buddy, can you spare a rib?
Come on pal, just give me a hand
Some people say I got no backbone at all
But without my feet I can't make a stand
I need bones
Skeleton bones
I need bones
I wish I could finger who's stealing my spine
I wish I could see who's taking bones of mine
I wish I could keep my head attached to my neck
I've lost so much, I'm becoming a wreck
I need bones, skeleton bones
I need bones, skeleton bones
I need bones, skeletal bones
I need bones, skeletal bones
