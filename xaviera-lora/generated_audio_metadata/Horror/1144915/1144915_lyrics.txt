And how's this for a white dream?
Please to welcome you
I see my doorman let you in
A dream directed you to me
To confess a sin
You're very unafraid
To enter this hall again
You really dare something
Say, I'm a handsome man
You seem so lonely here
Darkness everywhere
Only the whispers of hidden shadows
Well, I'm not alone
The dead are my company
And now you are here
Woman of my fantasy
I can smell your sweat
It's hot here, I must confess
Come a little closer
And I have returned rest
She's alive, she's not welcome
I prefer dead flesh
What remains of her
I'll be my winner
Ready or not
Here I come
I hear you scream, obey my will
I enjoy your scream, I'm ready to kill
Quick, wake me up!
This dress was always one of my favorites.
Do you remember it? Of course you do.
You remember everything now, don't you?
Your memories are what fuels me.
Your mouth says no
But your body says yes
Don't turn away, look at me
Look what you did to me
Now it's time to play
What are you having, son?
(Laughs)
You got it, girl!
Running for my life
Through an endless way
Running to escape
To my blood-hot grave
Blood drips on the floor
Moans of agony
In the distance I see a light
Hope to break free
Hope to break free
Hope to break free
Hope to break free
