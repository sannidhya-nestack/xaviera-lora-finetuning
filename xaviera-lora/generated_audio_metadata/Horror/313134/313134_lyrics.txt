You can't go until I say you can go
And I'll say you can go when you're dead
Give me life
Give me life
Be happy in the knowledge that I shall weep over your dead body
Be happy in the knowledge that I shall weep over your dead body
Give me life! Give me life!
Help! Help me!
But you're supposed to die!
I want to live!
You can't go until I say you can go!
And I'll say you can go when you're dead!
Give me life!
Give me life, give me life, give me life
Give me life
Give me life
