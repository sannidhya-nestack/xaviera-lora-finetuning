On moonlit eve, where the shadows creep
Lies a house in the woods where witches sleep
The wind it howls, the crows take flight
As the cauldron bubbles in the dead of night
Oh gather round it's Halloween where goblins dance
And ghosts are seen in the witch's house
The spirits sing a festive tale for the night's dark king
Candles flicker on the window pane
Jack-o'-lanterns brimming, feeling no shame
Black cats purr by the eerie green
On this haunted night of Halloween
Oh gather round, it's Halloween
Where goblins dance and ghosts are seen
In the witch's house the spirits sing
A festive tale for the night's dark king
Spooky winds through the old oak trees
Bring whispers carried by the autumn breeze
With witches laughter in the air, beware
