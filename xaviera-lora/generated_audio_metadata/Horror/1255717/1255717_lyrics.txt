(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
It's Halloween, it's Halloween
A time of fun and a little bit of fright
The moon is full and the stars are bright
Put on your costume, it's quite a sight
Halloween, Halloween night, magic in the air
Ghosts and goblins everywhere
Trick or treat, a fun-filled night
Candy and laughter, oh what a delight
Halloween, Halloween, magic in the air
Ghosts and goblins everywhere
Your treat, a fun filled night
Candy and laughter, oh what a delight
Jack-o'-lanterns shining bright
In the midst of a spooky night
Witches on their brooms take flight
Oh what an exciting night
Halloween, Halloween, time to cheer
Seeing costumes far and near
Playful screams we love to hear
Halloween, oh Halloween, he's finally here
And when the night is done, we'll have had our fun
We'll take off our masks and wait for the morning sun
So happy Halloween everyone
With lots of candy and lots of fun
It's Halloween, it's Halloween
Now our little song is done
