On holy eve when the moon is bright
In the heart of the woods stands a house in the night
With creaks and groans and whispers of dread
The witch's old house where the brave fear to tread
Ooh, the witch's night
Ooh, in the pale moonlight
Ooh, shadows come to life on this haunting Halloween night
The crows take flight with a ghostly caw
As the fog rolls in with its chilling maw
Through cobwebbed windows and creaking doors
Beware of the witch and her magic stores
Ooh, the witch's night
Ooh, in the pale moonlight
Ooh, shadows come to life on this haunting Halloween night
Black cats prowl with eyes aglow
Pumpkins cackle with a fiery show
Skeletons dance on the old graveyard
In the spooky night, no place safe or barred
Ooh, the witch's night
Ooh, in the pale moonlight
Ooh, shadows come to life
On this haunting Halloween night
Spells are whispered in the midnight air
Candles flicker with a ghastly glare
Children listen to the tales of fright
Of the witch's spell on this eerie night
Ooh, the witch's night, ooh, in the pale
