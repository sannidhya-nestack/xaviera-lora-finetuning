Oh, how lonely when the moon's full and bright
In a quaint little village bathed in eerie light
There stands a witch's house deep in the wood
Where cackles and whispers are misunderstood
Oh, come hear the tale of that shadowy trail
Where the mist wraps around like a ghostly veil
In the witch's house where the cauldrons brew
Spells of mischief cast by a frightening crew
Cobwebs and candles flicker in the gloom
Skeletons waltz in the dusty old room
Black cats shimmer with eyes aglow
And pumpkins grin with a wicked flow
Spooky nights and haunted sights
Witches flying across starry skies
Creaky doors and shadows play
Ghostly figures'til break of day
They stir the pot with a devilish charm
Chanting spells to raise the alarm
Ghosts and ghouls join the dance
In the house where danger's in hands
The clock strikes twelve, the witching hour
As bats take flight from the ancient tower
Goblins and fiends from the hidden lair
Chasing dreams out of thin air
Double double toil and trouble
In the woods where dark winds rumble
Haunted tales, whispers float
In the witch's house, night's emote
So heed this warning well my friend
When Halloween night shadows descend
