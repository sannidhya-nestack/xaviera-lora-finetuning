In the crisp fall air when everyone's aware
There's a spooky delight filling up the night
Jack-o'-lanterns glowing, eerie shadows they're casting
It's Halloween night when weird fun's everlasting
Oh Halloween, Halloween, full of fright and gleam
Stroll through the midnight
As if in a dream
Candy corn and costumes
Tales filled with doom
It's Halloween when the spirits freely roam
Witches on their brooms
Soaring through the sky
Goblins and ghosts thrill us
As they pass us by
Creepy and kooky
Mystery in every nook
It's Halloween
The excitement has us shook
Halloween, Halloween, screams break the quiet serene
Trick or treat, from door to door we glean
Feel the thrilling chill run down your spine
It's Halloween when the ordinary and odd intertwine
As midnight looms, it's time to say goodbye
To this haunt filled night under the starry sky
Wait another year for Halloween's return
When ghosts are friendly and witches let their cauldrons churn
As midnight looms
It's time to say goodbye
To this haunt filled night
Under the starry sky
Wait another year
For Halloween's return
When ghosts are friendly
And witches let their cauldrons churn
