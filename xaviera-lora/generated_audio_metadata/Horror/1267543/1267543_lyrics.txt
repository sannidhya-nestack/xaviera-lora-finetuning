In shadows deep where moonlight gleams
There lies a house of haunted dreams
A witch's land with charm and spell
A place where secrets darkly dwell
On how we eat
The air is cold, a tale of whispers ages old
The witches dance by candles where their cauldron
Bubbles magic in the air with broomsticks high
They soar the night, their laughter echoes
Eerie, bright, a black cat
Purrs its eyes aglow
Guarding secrets few would know
Ghosts once know
The pumpkins grin with wicked glee
Their calm smiles invite mystery
An owl hoots from an ancient tree
A guardian of this spooky spree
Whispery
Ghosts walk through corridors unseen
Their mournful cries a spectral sheen
A clock strikes twelve, the witching hour
When dark forces hold their power
The wind it howls, the leaves they swirl
In this haunted bewitching world
A tragic door
