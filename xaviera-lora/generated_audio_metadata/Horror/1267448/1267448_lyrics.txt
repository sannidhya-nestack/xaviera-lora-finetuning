In the eerie, echoing glen
the moon's pale light
Lies a house of riddles on Halloween night
Candles flicker in the gloom
Whispers through the hall
Where the witchweaves shadows and spiderwebs sprawl
Children dare not wander close to her door
For they've heard the stories that chill to the core
Ooh, through the witch's house where shadows play
Spooky specters roam on a ghostly holiday
Roomsticks dance, cauldrons bubble, hear the banshees scream
In the witch's lair you enter a nightmare's dream
Ooh, the witch's house where shadows play
Spooky spectres roam on a ghostly holiday
Goblins and ghouls join the spectral parade
With jack-o'-lanterns grinning in the midnight masquerade
Festive fear, wicked cheer on howling eve
In the witch's house believers believe
Ooh, the witch's house where shadows play
Spooky specters roam on a ghostly holiday
Skeletons sway, witches cackle, hear the midnight bell
In her twisted labyrinth where legends dwell
Ooh, the witch's house where shadows play
