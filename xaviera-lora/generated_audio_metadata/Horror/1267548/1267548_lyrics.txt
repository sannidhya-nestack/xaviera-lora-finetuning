Bye-bye.
Far all round see the wounded lines
Casting shadows thin and wise
In the woods where whispered whale
Lies the witch's home of squankled tale
Past the pumpkins through the mist
In a boat where spirits twist
Stands the house most dark and old
Where weary stories of darks fall
Spider webs and creeping flies
Guard the door where terror dines
Wicked laughter fills the air
On the smell-bound house, beware
In the witch house on Halloween
Cackles ring and shadows lean
With each creak and with each growl
A tale of fright is worn and low
Bats take flight at dusk's first light
Jack-o'-lanterns burning bright
Ghostly figures start to dance
Under moonlight's chilling trance
Candles flicker on the silks
Chilling air, it brings cold thrills
From the cauldrons, bubbling brood
Spirits rise to haunt anew
In the witch house on Halloween
Cat bowls swing and shadows lean
With each creak and with each growl
A tale of fright is born and grown
Midnight strikes, a raven's call
Eyes that watch from down the hall
Potions brew and tendrils creep
Through the door where nightmares seek
Children whisper, huddle close
Scared of things they fear the most
But the witch with eyes so keen
Weeds her magic, sights unseen
In the witch house on Halloween
Cackles ring and shadows lean
With each creak and with each groan
A tale of fright is born and grown
When dawn breaks and fades the night
