I like to creep through the cemetery on a dark and fog filled night sneaking past
The sleeping skeletons to give the ghost an awful fright
On my toes I slink and slither, moaning through the trees
The graveyard bones begin to clatter as I howl into the breeze
I like to creep
Through a haunted house and make old floorboards start to squeak
I rep the doors and swirl the dust around
And hear the attic groan and shriek
In the hall I tiptoe down the stairs
And hide behind the drapes
And wait to scare those who enter here
For they cannot escape
I like to creep when the moon is full
And while the wild beasts howl and bathe
Lurking in
The darkest edge of night I watch the wild spirits play
Dancing with such ghoulish glee
They twirl with frightful mirth
And as the rays of dawn approaches they fade into the earth
I like to creep
I like to creep
I like to creep
I like to creep
