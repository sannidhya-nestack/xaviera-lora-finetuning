In the night, ghosts take flight
With the moon, so make it bright
Witches laugh, goblins play
Halloween is here today
Spooky night, spooky night
Monsters come to give a fright
Spooky night, spooky night
It's all in fun, so don't take fright
Bats go swoosh, owls go coo
Pumpkin faces look so cute
Costumes on, treats to seek
Halloween fun all week
Spooky night, spooky night, monsters don't care for fright
Spooky night, spooky night, they fall in front so don't take bite
Laps go swoosh, owls go hoot, pumpkin faces look so cute
Costumes on, treats to seek, Halloween fun all week
Spooky night, spooky night, monsters come to give a fright
Spooky night, spooky night, it's all the parts that don't take fright
Let's go swoosh, I'll go hoot
Pumpkin faces look so cute
Costumes on, treats to seek
Halloween fun all week
Spooky night, spooky night
Monsters come to give a fight
Spooky night, spooky night
It's only fun so don't take flight
