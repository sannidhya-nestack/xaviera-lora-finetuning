It's Halloween, it's Halloween
Time for fun, never mean
See the pumpkins glowing bright
In the cool spooky night
Halloween, Halloween
Dress up and jump in
Lots of sweets, trick or treat
Let the Halloween night begin
There are witches, there are ghosts
Friendly ones are lovely hosts
Skeletons dance, bats take flight
Oh what a magical sight
Halloween, Halloween
What's the spookiest thing you've seen?
Candies galore, doors are doored
It's the best night you've ever seen
So let's cheer, Halloween's here
Fill the night with fun and cheer
Halloween, Halloween
Now it's time to dream, sweet dream
Halloween, Halloween, dress up and jump in, in
Lots of sweets, trick or treat, let the wind
Lots of sweets, trick or treat, let the Halloween night begin
There are witches, there are ghosts, friendly ones are lovely hosts
Skeletons, gans, that's take flight, oh what a magical sight
Halloween, Halloween, what's the spookiest thing you've seen?
Candies galore door to door, it's the best night you've ever seen
So let's cheer, Halloween's here
Fill the night with fun and cheer
Halloween, Halloween
Now it's time to dream, sweet dream
Dream, sweet dream
Halloween
