Freak show
Freak look
Freak sight
Always freak
Bust a kill
Freak come through vampire
Freak show you know
Always freak
I've tried my best
Fitting into this search
Normalness
Even though I'm a freak show
Some sign my myth
I'm done with trying my best
Abnormal, yes
Now you know I'm a freak show
See the look we're spending many many years
Trying to fit in with the rest never knowing what it was
I grew up seeing devils and demons
Angelic beings from both sides screaming choose us
Took a warrant on a little kid's body
Got me singing louder than an entire choir of Pavarotti's
Astral projecting directly to heavens
Wanna witness the inner litmus of the creators, Fibonacci
So I embody an angelical relic that nobody understandin'
Like I'm muter than Helen Kelloggit
That's why I've always been ignored
And the music has been treated like a delegate
Hundred percent irrelevant
I guess it's more for a later date stored and recorded
Time ahead of it for the time that they gettin' it
And till then I'm a free show
Let the feet go, levitate to the locals, etiquette
I've tried my best
Fitting into this
Such normalness
Even though I'm a freak show
Some say my best
I'm done with trying my
Now you know I'm a freak show (Razakiel) I'm a freak show, I love to say it
Cast down like the devil, you know what the name is
Razakiel, still here, always been made
Sacrifices took the pain, now I got leather skin
That ain't a bad thing, it made me stronger
Some people thought I wouldn't last, I made it even longer
I ain't weak, so they call me a freak
Critique my every single move, but they copy my techniques
I'm unique
I don't fit in
And I finally learned to accept it
No longer neglected, no longer affected
I live my own way, you ain't gotta respect it
And no matter what I say or do
I'll always know
I'm forever a freak show
I've tried my best
Such normalness
Even though I'm a freak show
Some say my myth
I'm done with trying my best
Now you know I'm a freak show
One of the weirdest in the game, my ocular is strange
A popularity, my polarity, care to be carefree?
I'm there to be different, insignificant
What all of these trendy niggas thinkin' they wanna dare me?
Bare me, glaring, barely standin', novation
Sanity waitin', outside of the mental hospital
I am a ancient patient, profitable, edible, the general of etiquette
Weirdo with the beardo and I probably stay irrelevant
Celebate, celebrated by the outcast
And the culture stay elevated on the elevator to hell
Purgatory my story is in a glory in a galactic
Filled with passion
When you dropping a hot scene go for the masses
Is what they keep asking
I don't give a flying fuck a freak show I'm a fire breathing dragon
I've tried my best
Even though I'm a freak show, subside my myth
I'm done with trying my best
I've normal years
Now you know I'm a freak show
I've tried my best
Fitting into this
Such normalness
Even though I'm a freak show
Some sign my mess
I'm done with trying my best
Abnormal, yes
Now you know I'm a freak show
