It's Halloween night, it's oh so bright
With pumpkins glowing in the moonlight
Ghosts and goblins, witches on brooms
Running around in the magical gloom
Halloween, Halloween, oh what a stunt
Kids trick or treating in the night
Candies and costumes, lots of fun
This is a night for everyone
They're everyone
Cats and bats and spooky things
Oh, the joy that Halloween brings
A jack-o'-lantern smile so sweet as we say
Trick or treat
Halloween, Halloween, so exciting
With spooky tales and moonlight inviting
We'll laugh and play until the end
Then dream of Halloween again
Good night Halloween'til next year
We'll wait for you with much cheer
Now it's time to close our eyes after a night of fun and surprise
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween so exciting
Kids trick or treating in the night
Candies and costumes and lots of fun
This is a night for everyone
Halloween
Have to buy some spooky things
Oh, the joy that Halloween brings
A jack-o'-lantern smells so sweet
As we say, "Trick or treat !"
Halloween, Halloween, so exciting
With spooky tales of moonlighting, brightening
We'll retell the moonlight in brighting
We'll laugh and play until the end
Then dream of Halloween again
Goodnight Halloween'til next year
We'll wait for you with much cheer
Now it's time to close our eyes after a night of fun and surprise
Disapprise
Halloween again
