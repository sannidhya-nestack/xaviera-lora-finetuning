In the chill of Halloween Eve
Witches have old Mickey leave
that house where shadows roam
Echoes call the spirits home
Hear the whispers, hear the cries
Spooky tales beneath the skies
Wandering ghosts and witches grew
On this night they come for you
Cauldrons bubble, fires bright
Jack-o'-lanterns gleam with light
Cats of black and screeching crows
Guide the path where phantom blows
Hear the whispers, hear the cries
Spooky tales beneath the skies
Wandering ghosts and witches brew
On this night they come for you
In the gloom, the shadows dance
Mischief looms, a spectral trance
Haunted winds, a chilling breeze
Graveyards watch, or twisted trees
Candles flicker in the night
Casting spells in pale moonlight
Doors will creak and windows moan
Spirit footsteps etched in stone
Hear the whispers, hear the cries
Spooky tales beneath the skies
Wandering ghosts and witches brew
On this night they come for you
So beware as night descends
