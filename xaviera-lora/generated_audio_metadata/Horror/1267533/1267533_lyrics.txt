In a dark and lonely forest where the shadows play
There's a tale they whisper softly on a moonless night they say
Of a house on the hilltop where witches dwell
With their cauldron bubbling greenly
Casting dark and evil spells
On a spooky Halloween
Under pale moonlight
Children dare not venture near
In the dead of night
For the witch in the window with a cackle and a grin
Awaits the brave and foolish to draw them in
Ooh, the witch's house, the witch's house
Where the ghosts and goblins hide
Ooh, the witch's house, the witch's house
Beware what lurks inside
Jack-o'-lanterns flicker with their eerie light
That's a swooping shadows creeping but what a fright
Through the crooked trees and tangled vines
Hear the echoes of lost souls and their haunting signs
In the parlor on the mantle lies an old enchanted book
Full of curses and dark verses if you dare to take a look
A raven mocks, a black cat prowls, the clock strikes midnight clear
Welcome to the witch's lair on this night of fear
Ooh, the witch's house, the witch's house
Where the secrets never die
Ooh, the witch's house, the witch's house
Hear the banshees cry
By the bubbling cauldron, she'll saunter and she'll stir
Potions made from spider legs and wings of bat in her purr
With a pointed hat and a varted nose, she waits to catch the wanderer
Who dares to get too close
So heed this spooky warning on Halloween Eve
When the night is filled with magic, tricks, and otherworldly thieves
If you see a shadow moving through the Misty Glen
It's better to stay far away and never return again
Ooh, the witch's house
