In the cool of the evening when the moon is bright
There's a chill in the air and it's Halloween night
Creatures are stirring, oh what a sight
Ghouls and witches taking flight
Halloween, Halloween, bats in the night
Pumpkin lanterns shining bright
Trick or treat around the street
Echoes of the midnight beat
Haunted houses filled with dread
Skeletons hang by a thread
Ghostly shadows start to creep
As the world goes quiet in sleep
Halloween, Halloween, a chilling sight
Sounds of laughter fill the night
Candy corn and apple bob
Welcome to the Monster's ue
Through the swirling autumn leaves
Hear the rustle, feel the breeze
As the clock chimes twelve, oh please
Halloween don't ever cease
Halloween, Halloween, oh what a thrill
Evening full of spooky chill
Make a wish, it might come true
On this night of orange and blue
As the dawn starts breaking light
And Halloween fades into the night
Memories made tales to tell
Of the Halloween night we know so well
