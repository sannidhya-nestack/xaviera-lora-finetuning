I, I, I
Walking through the night under the pale moonlight
Yackling and grinning wide, there's nowhere to hide
Shadows dancing, something's glancing
It's Halloween, nights chancing
Oh Halloween, oh Halloween
Your tales are yet unseen
Ghosts whispering, spirits giggling
In the night evergreen
Candy in hand, costumes so grand
Across the spooky land
Creaky gates, unknown fates, endless haunted debate
Oh Halloween, oh Halloween, where witches convene
A black cat's hoot, an owl's salute to the king and the queen
Oh, oh, the clock strikes twelve
Secrets to delve under the spell we weave
One more fright on Halloween night before we leave
Oh Halloween, oh Halloween, fear not the unseen
One more toast to our gracious host until the next Halloween
Candy in hand, costume so grand, across the spooky land
Creaky gates, unknown fates, endless haunted debates
Candy in hand, costume so grand, across the spooky land
Creaky gates, unknown fates, endless haunted debates
Oh Halloween, oh Halloween, where witches convene
A black cat's hoot, an owl's salute, to the king and the queen
A clock strikes twelve, secrets to delve under the spell we weave
One more fright on Halloween night before we leave
A clock strikes twelve, secrets to delve under the spell we weave
One more fright on Halloween night before we leave
Fear and not be unseen
One more toast to our gracious host
But'til the next Halloween
