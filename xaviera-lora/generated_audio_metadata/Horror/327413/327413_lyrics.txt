I'm pissed at all the things you do
You are pissed at me for nothing new
Part of me is superficial
Part of me is substantial
This is how it is
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
Move too slow to make mistakes
I can make those quick decisions
Pick away the useless part
And I can quit before I start
This is how it is
Here it is how it ends
Then I will kiss them
And they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
This is how it ends
Here is how we win
This is how it ends
Here is how we win
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
Get out, get still, the name of life
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
And I will kiss them and they will bite
