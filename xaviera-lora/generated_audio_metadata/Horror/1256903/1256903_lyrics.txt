Once a year when the moon is full, it's a night of thrill, it's never dull
Through the streets, under a spell, it's time for Halloween, can you tell?
There's a chill creeping in the air, ghosts, ghouls and creatures everywhere
Carved out faces in the night, lighting up with a brilliant fright
Oh, it's Halloween
Let's raise a cheer
For the most haunted time of the year
Bring your costume, get into gear
Our favorite fighting night is finally here
Trick or treat down the spooky way
Scary stories that the witches say
Craft in darkness, sounds of delight
Children laughing as they ignite the night
From haunted houses to cobweb trees
Candy apples to bones that freeze
It's a night filled with fun and fear
A string celebration that we hold dear
Oh, it's Halloween, let's raise our cheer
For the most haunted time of the year
Bring your costume, get into gear
Our favorite Friday night is finally here
From haunted houses to cobweb trees
Candy apples to bones that freeze
It's a night filled with fun and fear
A strange celebration, let me hold it dear
Oh, it's Halloween full of mystery
Unveiling the hidden history
Jack-o'-lanterns shine with glee
In the spirit of this season, we're all free
We're all free
We're all free! The clock strikes midnight, it's time to leave
Shadows grow long on this all-hallows eve
Until next year will hold its essence
Remembering this Halloween night's presence
