On Halloween Eve when the moon set high
A witch's house where secrets lie
Through twisted trees and cobblestone
Where shadows dance and ghosts do roam
Oh, the haunted witch house at the end of the lane
Filled with whispers and ghouls that drive you insane
Step inside if you dare to the eerie domain
Where the spirits of all hollows evil reign
Handles flicker in the dimly lit hall
Spider webs lace every wall
Cauldrons bubble, dark potions brew
A spell or two just might catch you
Oh, the haunted witch house at the end of the lane
Filled with whispers and ghouls that drive you insane
Step inside if you dare to the eerie domain
Where the spirits of all hollows evil reign
Skeletons dance in the midnight hour
And dashes scream with ghostly power
From pumpkin grins to black cat's glare
You'll find all spooky things right there
Ghosts explode by the wind of pain
Monsters lurking can you feel the strain?
Trick or treat the legend grows
Inside that house where the dark wind blows
Oh, the happy rich house at the end of the lane
Filled with whispers and ghouls that drive you insane
Step inside if you dare to the eerie domain
Where the spirits of all hollows evil reign
So heed our tale on this haunted night
Beware the witch's house in the pale moonlight
For once you enter there's no turning back
You'll be forever caught in the spooky track
