It's Halloween night, not a soul in sight
We gather'round, under moon's pale light
Pumpkins glow, with a ghostly delight
Children laugh,'cause it's their fright night
Sweets and treats, streets to beat
Girls and sheets, in every meet
Oh, the sound of tiny little feet
Trick or treat, it's Halloween beat
Witches cackle, monsters groan
Skeletons rattle in a tone
Haunted houses full of moan
In this magic we are all alone
Candy corn as the dawn is torn
Save the last dance for the unicorn
Bats in flight, oh what a sight
In the bewitching hour of Halloween night
This tale of old
As nights unfold of heroes both
And which is cold, the morning light
Let's hold on tight, happy Halloween
Enjoy the night
