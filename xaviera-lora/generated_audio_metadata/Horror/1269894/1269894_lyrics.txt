In the night time shadows play
Have you seen jack-o'-lantern hay
With a grin so wide and bright
Wonders round on Halloween night
Creeping through the fox of thick
Holding candles, playing tricks
Laughing low and cackling mean
Strangest thing you've ever seen
Have you seen Jack let him go
Through the streets with eerie glow
Pumpkin head and all aglow
Spooky dance, a freaky show
In the park or down the lane
Tricks and treats they entertain
Watch your step don't lose your way
Jack-o'-lanterns out to play
Goblin friends they join and stare
Funny masks and crazy hair
Dance till dawn then disappear
Catch them now for they won't reappear
Have you seen Jack Lennon go
Through the streets with eerie glow
Pumpkin head and all aglow
Ski dance, a freaky show
