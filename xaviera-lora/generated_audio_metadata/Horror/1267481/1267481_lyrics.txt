In the heart of the woods where the old legends dwell
Lies a witch's home in a dark shadowed dell
Her windows are cracked and her doors creak with fright
She brews her foul potions by moon's eerie light
Skooky whispers on Halloween night
Witches' cackle ringing fills town folk with fright
Foggy bogs and gnarled logs
A haunting melody takes flight
The walls are adorned with cobwebs and dust
With candles that flicker and trees that mistrust
Pumpkins aglow with faces so grim
Eyes in the night watching on a whim
Spooky whispers on Halloween night
Witches' cackle ringing fills townsfolk with fright
Foggy bogs and gnarled logs
A haunting melody takes flight
Children dare not linger near
For the witch will feast on their fear
Run away, flee fast from the sight
Of the witch's house on Halloween night
She conjures the spirits to dance'round the fire
Their dance macabre, fearful inspire
Bats take wing and wolves howl in the gloom
As the witch sings her spell by the pale autumn moon
Spooky whispers of Halloween night
Witches' cackle ringing fills townsfolk with fright
Foggy bogs and gnarled logs
A haunting melody takes flight
So heed this tale of the witch by the wood
Stay far from her home as well as you should
For on Halloween Eve she stirs her dark brew
And waits for the souls that wander into her room
