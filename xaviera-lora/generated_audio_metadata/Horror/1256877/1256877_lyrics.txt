And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, you know, you know, you know, you know
And I know, I know, I know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I know, I know, I know
And I know, I know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I know, I know, you know, I know, you know, you know
And I know, I know, you know, I know, you know, you know, you know, you know
And I know, I know, you know, you know, you know, you know
And I know, I know, you know, you know, you know
And I know, I know, you know, you know, you know
And I know, I know, you know, you know, you know
When the moon shining bright there's a whisper of fright in the air
Tales they tell of a spell by the old fishing well
Where shadows come alive if you dare
Halloween, Halloween
Dance with the spirits unseen
One can smile when the lights are key
Oh it's Halloween
Halloween
Through cobwebs and mist where black cats exist
Candies are a sinister trick or a treat
The nights of laughter and screams
Alive in your dreams
In this realm where the eerie and excited meet
Halloween, Halloween, stirring the spooky scene
Wearing costumes, we're not what we seem
Oh, it's Halloween
Under a spectral sky where the witches fly
No mortal soul can resist the thrill
Eccentric and strange in the night full of change
In the mystic enchantment we get our fill
Halloween, Halloween, playfully wicked and mean
Join the nocturnal carnival, join the Halloween
In the restoring wind or a sinister grin
Spooky tales return every year
Oh Halloween, the scene of the unseen
The scare you love to fear
Oh Halloween is here
