Cold night? Yeah, chill too. It's creepy. What's that noise? It, it's Cindy. It's Cindy. Can you hear that on my spine? Yeah, my heart is pumping. I'll go and check. It's very dark. I can hear bats. There's something down there.
What is it?
It's a tune
It looks like there's something missing from it
What's this thing?
Remember this
Because if you do, don't look back.
And it stays there, there, there.
The tomb is empty
What do you mean the tomb is empty?
They're telling you the tomb is empty
Oh my god
Killer Tomb is here
Killer Tomb is here
Run
Remember this
Whatever you do, don't look back
Nervous, spine chilling
Nervous, spine chilling, dread, blood curdling.
Cold night?
You, too, too
It's creepy
What's that noise?
It, it's Sentei
It's Sentei
She's not my spawn
Yeah, my heart is pumping
I'll go and check
There's something down there
What is it?
Oh my god, Chiller 2 is here! Chiller 2 is here! Run!
Remember this, whatever you do, don't
