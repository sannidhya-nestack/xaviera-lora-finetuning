Within the shadows where fallen angels tread
By secrets gathered by the moon, stories left unsaid
Twisted figures dancing, loneliness, silence on the plea
Underneath the velvet sky as black as black can be
Welcome, welcome to the night where only the brave can fight
Fear not the unseen, hear not the unheard
For in the end, they're just whispers of a word
