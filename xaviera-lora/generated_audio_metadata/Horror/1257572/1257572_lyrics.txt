It's about ing your ultimate.
It's Halloween night under the full moon's light
Candy in our bags, feeling so right
Like cats prowling, wolves are howling
Get ready baby,'cause the ghosts are growling
Halloween, oh Halloween
A night for tricks and a night for scream
In our masks, we're unseen
Living the magic that's Halloween
Jack-o-lanterns grinning, let the fun begin
Rusting leaves under our feet, here's the season's gin
Witches on their brooms, dancing in the gloom
Come join us now or you might meet your doom
Halloween, our favorite scene
Where the ghouls party, nice and mean
Feel the magic, oh so keen
In the haunted night, that's Halloween
The night is alive, it's Hallow's Eve
No need to hide, just believe
In haunted houses, zombies roam tonight the world
