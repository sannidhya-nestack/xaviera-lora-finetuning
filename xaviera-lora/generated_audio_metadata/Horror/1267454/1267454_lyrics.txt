On a moonlit Halloween Eve
To the witch's house we do perceive
Where shadows dance and whispers weave
Her cauldron boils, do you believe?
A winded house, the spirits roam
In the eerie night we're far from home
In the witch's house
All alone underneath the midnight stone
Through twisting woods and haunted trees
With every gust a ghostly breeze
Owls hoot and black cats tease
Her spells are cast, none to appease
A winded house, the spirits roam
In the eerie night we're far from home
In the witch's house
All alone underneath the midnight stone
Candles flicker, potions bubble, every shadow speaks of trouble
Enter now at your own risk, through the door of ancient brisk
Cobweb curtains, eerie light, beware the witch on this grim night
Her laugh echoes, take your flight or stay and face her wicked might
