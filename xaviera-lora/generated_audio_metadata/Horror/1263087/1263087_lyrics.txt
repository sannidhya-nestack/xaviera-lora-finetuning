And who are you, key of mystery delve
Where the shadows twist and secrets dwell
In the heart of the haunted grove
Where spirits floss in the chilling cove
Hear the sonic tapestry woven by the breeze
A chorus woven by ghostly trees
Eternal echoes within stone halls
In tales whispered through crumbling walls
Underneath the weary moon's artistic smear
Where spectral figures loom so near
Enveloped amidst the mournful air
Engulfed in the solace of the night's quiet stare
Strings of harmonies resound in the cold night's grip
Puppets dancing to the master's script in the depths of despair
