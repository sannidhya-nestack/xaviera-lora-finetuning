The castle's reelin' and rockin'
The zombies have lost their head
At the cemetery they're dying to get in
Who said this place is dead?
The mummies rappin' in their coffin
It's the scariest bash of the year
It's a Halloween hoedown
It's a coolish cool time
The Frankenstein dance is here
So lock your knees together
And get a stiff-arm stance
Stomp around like Boris Karloff
You're doing the Frankenstein dance
Frankenstein, Frankenstein
With an eerie flash of lightning
In walks Frankenstein's bride
When he sees her his boat gets tighter
He wobbles over to her side
They crash and thrash together
The crowds part at their advance
They're a wrecking crew
They go bump in the night
They're doing the Frankenstein dance
So lock your knees together
And get a stiff arms dance
Stop around like Boris Karloff
You're doing the Frankenstein dance
Frankenstein, Frankenstein
Frankenstein, Frankenstein
Oh, Frankenstein dance
Frankenstein, Frankenstein
Oh, you go Frankie boy
All around the graveyards
It's the very latest craze
When ghosts and goblins get funky
It's a very spooky display
Frankie's really got that rhythm
He seems like he's in a trance
Calling the doctor, that boy is on fire
He's doing the Frankenstein dance
So lock your knees together
And get a stiff arm stance
Stomp around like Boris Karloff
You're doing a Frankenstein dance
Frankenstein
Get down you big bad boy
Frankenstein
Frankenstein
Don't lose your head
The good is good time
