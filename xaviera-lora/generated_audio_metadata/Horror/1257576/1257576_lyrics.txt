Under a full moon shining light
It's Halloween tonight
Creatures creeping out of sight
Ready to give a fright
Ghosts and goblins, witches too, dawned in their attire
Pumpkins glowing side by side in this night of fire
Trick or treating, knocking doors, candy brings delight
Halloween, Halloween is a mystical night
Cobwebs hanging that's taking flight
Whispers in the air
Costumes rustling in the night
Shills run everywhere
Cauldrons bubble and spells are cast
In this haunting spree
Halloween, Halloween, oh what a night to be
Candy sweet and tail so bleak, under the moon's soft light
Halloween, Halloween, a thrilling, chilly night
As the clock is ticking, the mysteries unfold
Halloween, Halloween, whose hand will you hold?
Shadows dancing with the night, as the stars take flight
Halloween, Halloween, until the morning light
Dreadnoughts, a voxel I used to get
Halloween, Halloween, Cunhouse to a downing light
As the clock is ticking, the mysteries unfold
Halloween, Halloween
