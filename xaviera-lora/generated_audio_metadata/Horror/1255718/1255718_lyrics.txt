Pumpkins glowing in the night
Halloween's such a delight
Costumes on, we're all in sight
Marching under the pale moonlight
Trick or treat in the street
Cries of joy, oh so sweet
Halloween, Halloween can't be beat
With good friends and candy to eat
Knocking on each neighbor's door
Hoping for a bit more
Ghosts and goblins galore
We'll play pretend forevermore
Halloween, Halloween full of fun
Spooky games for everyone
Halloween, Halloween now begun
Underneath the setting sun
As the day turns into night
We sing this song in soft moonlight
Halloween, Halloween, what a sight
Filled with laughter, joy and slight fright
Halloween, Halloween full of fun
Spooky games for everyone
Halloween, Halloween now begun
Underneath the setting sun
As the day turns into night
We sing this song in soft moonlight
Halloween, Halloween what a sight
Filled with laughter, joy and slight fright
Halloween, Halloween full of fun
Spooky games for everyone
Halloween, Halloween now begun
Underneath the setting sun
Filled with laughter, joy and slight fright
