In a land where the moon never sleeps
Shadows whisper and the cold wind weeps
The owl hoots a chilling sound
Echoing over the haunted ground
Welcome to the dark where fears reside
This is Halloween, there's nowhere to hide
In the depths of night when spirits roam
Beware, for you are not alone
Black cats prowling in the spectral glow
Pumpkins grinning with faces of woe
A scarecrow's shadow quietly creeps
Watching over as the graveyard sleeps
Beneath the ancient trees, souls arise
Reflecting the pain in their hollow eyes
This is Halloween when ghosts are free
In the eerie dance of the cemetery
So beware when the dark closes in
This Halloween let the spectral feast begin
In the haunting silence let the night be exposed
In the moon's cold light every fear grows
