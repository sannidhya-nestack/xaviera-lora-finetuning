The wind is cold, the moon is red
The graves are open, the lost undead
Shadows crawl, the night is near
Whispers fill the air with fear
Chains are rattling, doors will creak
Halloween is what we seek
Halloween, Halloween
Scream it loud, a cursed unseen
Halloween, Halloween
Fear returns in endless dream
Thunder cracks, the sky will bleed
Demons laughing while they feed
Pumpkins glow, the spirits rise
Evil burning in their eyes
This is true what's there
Hear the call
Blood and fire, night supreme
Halloween, eternal scream
Come, run, the night has won
Halloween has just begun
