And glowingly by the woods called me
Was the witch's house from an olden dream
With freaky doors and a whispered lore
Candles flicker near the wooden floor
In the spooky, spooky night
Her shadows dance in eerie light
The witch's laugh echoes everywhere
In the midnight air if you dare beware
Through the haunted woods where the owls call
Children whisper tales of the midnight ball
A ghostly tune sings the silver moon
Fester fears grow as they venture soon
In the spooky, spooky night
Where shadows dance in eerie light
The witches laugh, echoes everywhere
In the midnight air if you dare beware
All the music plays, a spell is cast
Stories ancient from a darkened past
Pumpkins grinning with a fiery glow
Follow the path where the brave ones go
In a gown of night, the witch draws near
With a knowing smile and a hint of fear
She beckons close with a cryptic prose
As the spine-chilled wind around them blows
In the spooky, spooky night
Where shadows dance in eerie light
The witch's laugh echoes everywhere
In the midnight air if you dare beware
On Halloween Eve in the still dark shade
By the witch's house many memories made
If you hear that sound don't turn around
For in the witch's spell you may be bound
