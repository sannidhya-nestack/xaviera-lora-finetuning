Halloween, Halloween, oh what fun
We dress up and scare everyone
Witches, ghosts and big black cats
Funny hats and little bats
Halloween, Halloween, trick or treat
So many yummy candies to eat
Knockin' on doors up and down the street
Each decorated house is so neat
Pumpkins glowing with a smile
We can see them from a mile
Halloween, Halloween, what a sight to see
With our costumes, we're happy as can be
In the cold October nights
Underneath the pale moonlight
We laugh and play it so divine
Oh Halloween you're truly fine
Halloween Halloween now it's time to go
The best night ever this we know
And as we say our last goodnight
We smile wide, oh what a night
Halloween, Halloween, that's the theme
See you next year in our dream
Halloween, Halloween, trick or treat
So many yummy candies to eat
Lying on doors up and down the street
Each decorated house is so neat
Pumpkins blowing with a smile
We can see them from a mile
Halloween, Halloween, what a sight to see
With our costumes, we're happy as can be
In the cool October nights
Underneath the pale moonlight
We laugh and play, it's so divine
Oh Halloween, you're truly fine
Oh Halloween, you're truly fine
