In a house on the hill where shadows play
Lives a witch who comes out Halloween day
With a broomstick and a cat so black
She throws her potions and there's no turning back
Oh, under the moon's eerie light
It's Halloween
The Witch's Delight
In the dead of the night when the winds will howl
She gathers the pumpkins and starts to prowl
In her tattered cloak and pointed hat
She casts her spells with a hiss and a spat
Oh, under the moon's eerie light
It's Halloween
The Witch's Delight
In the haunted wood where the spirits roam
She raises the dead from their earth home
With a cackle that chills to the bone
She dances with ghost chills down to the stone
Under the moon's eerie light
It's Halloween, the witch's delight
Children tread softly, knocking door to door
But beware of the witch, you won't know what's in store
With a cauldron bubbling, her eyes so bright
She weaves her magic on this festal night
Oh, under the moon's eerie light
It's Halloween, the witch's delight
So gather round my friends while you still can
For the witch's spell is coming to spend
Through the darkest woods and the haunted halls
The witch's laughter forever calls
Oh, oh, oh, under the moon
