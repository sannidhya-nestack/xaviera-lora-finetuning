In the deepest cloak of night'neath an alien glow
Reside whispers in the echo where frosted breezes blow
Amidst the hush chilly and stark beneath the blackbird's arc
A ballet of dancing shadows in the heart of the dark
In the fortress of our hearts a melody swells
Narratives from ancient times in art and sound it tells
In the chamber spectres dressed in gowns so grand (so grand)
To the rhythm of secret songs side by side we stand (we stand)
In the lair of hushed murders, woodland air so cold
The anthem of the midnight, tales of spectres bold
The crook's mirth spreads, the game's plea, tear the air
In the lunar glow unfolds a narrative raw and bare
From the ages, using machine, a lament ascends
The corpse did tread in our steps
The temple it sends
In the courtyard of the deceased
Under the silvery strand
To the rhythm of the serene
The ghastly truth makes it stand
Makes it stand
In the rhythm of the dark
Quiet among the graves
Among the graves, among the graves
A sinister composition lives
Except only the night sends
Only the night sends
An eerie serenade
A moment eternally spent
Eternally spent
We are the children of the dusk
We are phantoms in the band, phantoms in the band
