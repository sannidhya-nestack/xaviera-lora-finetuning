In the town where shadows loom
Near the edge of woods dark and gloom
There's a house with a haunted past
Witches' whispers heard on every blast
Ooh, Halloween night so drear
Witches gather, joy and near
Spooky tales and shadows cast
In the witch's house, spells are fast
Candles flicker with ghostly gleam
Cackling laughter, a ghostly theme
Eyes in darkness, spirits call
Through the cobwebbed ancient hall
Ooh, Halloween night so drear
Witches gather, draw in near
Spooky tales and shadows cast
In the witched house, those are fast
Pumpkins glow on every hill
Swill winds send a chilly thrill
Footsteps echo, don't look back
Lest you feel a witch's knack
Knock three times, a door will creak
Enter if your heart is meek
Potions bubble, cold as steam
Welcoming you to a horrid dream
Halloween nights so drear
Witches gather, draw in near
Spooky tales and shadows cast
In the witch's house, spells are fast
As the moon hangs high and bright
Beware the witch's house tonight
Leave with haste, don't tempt fate
Or be ensnared at the haunted gate
