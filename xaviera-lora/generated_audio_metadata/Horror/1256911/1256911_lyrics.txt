When the moon is bright on a star-filled night
Do you feel the sight of the Halloween fright?
Pumpkins are burning, ghosts are spinning
Sounds of Halloween are just beginning
It's Halloween, it's Halloween
The crispest, chilliest night you've ever seen
The witches' cat sweets across the moon's gleam
Oh what a sight, it's Halloween
Pools are lurking and bats are twirling
The chill in the air is certainly swirling
Candy and costumes and children's delight
In our little town on Halloween night
It's Halloween, it's Halloween
Fly in the vibe that's oh so serene
From dusk to dawn in the sparkling night sheen
The magic's alive, it's Halloween
So grab your brew or wear your cap
On this eerie night we Halloween lap
In the witching hours gentle tap
It's Halloween tonight ready for the night's wrap
It's Halloween, it's Halloween
Ghouls are lurking and bats are twirling
The crispest, chilliest night you've ever seen
The witch's cat sleeps across the moon's gleam
Oh what a sight, it's Halloween
Oh what a sight, it's Halloween
