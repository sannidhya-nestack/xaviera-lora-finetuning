Rush of the shadows where the ravens fly
Haunted echoes whisper beneath the cursed sky
In the realm of the spectral where the restless dwell
Ring the nocturnal chimes of the phantom's bell
Awaken, spirits of all Hallows' Eve
In darkened corners where the spiders weep
Moonlight waltz in the night summer cloak
Entwined in the mystery whispered and spoke
Through the veil of twilight in the moon's cold gleam
Reigns the silent symphony of a chilling dream where the restless traverse
The corridors of fright on the stage of the shadows amidst the ghostly lights
Beware the black cat crosses your path in flight
In the whispers of the night that hold your breath
