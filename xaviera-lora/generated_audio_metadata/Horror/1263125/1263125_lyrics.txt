He chants dread with nightfall scathing
Upon the heart as battle's many
In haunted echo whispers cloud
otten lands and ancient halls
In the misty gloomy ceremony
Two solemn chants and moon's cascade
A chilling wind, such tales they tell
Of ghostly dance, its planned dirt well
Where crimson leaves mark the paths here, here
Beneath the light and gas
