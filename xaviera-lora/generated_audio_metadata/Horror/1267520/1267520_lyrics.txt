Where the fallen squirrels are made true
Behind the house of ancient stone
Where a darkened wish sits alone
Cuts and fires make their lair
In her home, a curse of affair
Cowboys hang like chandeliers
Tripping tales of haunted years
On Halloween, the spirits rise
Through the midnight, evil-lit skies
From the witcher's house, they creep and crawl
Echoes of a spectral call
Candles flicker, shadows dance
Eyes of strangers stolen glance
Whales whisper through the broken glass
Telling tales of hollow past
Oceans bubble, cauldrons brew
Ghostly whispers, secrets through
Black cat perched on windows ledge
Guarding against the night's dark edge
On Halloween, the spirits rise
Through the midnight, these moonlit skies
From the witch's house they creep and crawl
Echoes of a spectral call
And the slicker shadows dance
Eyes of strangers stolen glance
Waves whisper through the broken glass
Telling tales of hollows past
Potions double, cauldrons brew
Ghostly whispers, secrets brew
Black cat perched on windows ledge
Guarding against the night's dark edge
On Halloween, the spirits rise
Through the midnight, these moonlit skies
From the witches' house they creep and crawl
Echoes of a spectral call
Witches laughter on the breeze
Curdling blood making hearts freeze
Jack-o-lanterns guarding gates
Of this house where darkness waits
Children hide and children seek
In this night of frightful peak
But beware the witch's snare
For this eve holds dark despair
