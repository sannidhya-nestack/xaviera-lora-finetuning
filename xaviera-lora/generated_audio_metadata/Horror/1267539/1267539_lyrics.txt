I hope you're scared of all these things but let your guard down (I hope you're scared of all these things but let your guard down)
I hope you're scared of all these things but let your guard down (I hope you're scared of all these things but let your guard down)
I hope you're scared of all these things but let your guard down (I hope you're scared of all these things but let your guard down)
I hope you're scared of all these things but let your guard down (I hope you're scared of all these things but let your guard down)
The witch's house can stand so tall where the bats and the banshees call
In the dark where the pumpkins gleam you'll hear the children scream
Look at this verse in the midnight breeze there'll be secrets between those trees
The floor where the witches chat their ancient lore
The religious house with its creaky door
Horror awaits and so much more
Through the keyhole you might see
The legends of the devil's decree
The hallstone shadows black
Phantoms wander never back
Those sweet figures as the clock strikes twelve
Do the witches curse they delve?
Oranges house so dry so cold
Tales of terror to be told
Listen close the night reveals
All the fear that Halloween feels
Oranges cackle in the dead of night
Potions bubble in the candlelight
Harlan, sick bells he ne'er
Nightmares born from whispered fear
Oranges house where spirits roam
Echoing the call of home
Step inside if you dare
Halloween night, be ready there
