When you're a guest, what do you bring
To a vampire wedding
Maybe a human sacrifice
Or will a pint of blood suffice
I brought a pint, they cut me some slack
The bride and groom, both wore black
The weirdest wedding you've never seen
They took their vows on Halloween
We like the night, we want a real moon tan
You keep the sun, we want a real moon tan
Some werewolves formed a conga line
The best man was Frankenstein
The maid of honor bit his neck
Frankie shrugged and said, "Oh, what the heck?"
The witch's slippers were ruby red
The zombies danced like they were dead
The headless horseman thought he looked cool
He looked more like a ghoul or a mule
We like the night, we want a real moon tan
You keep the sun, we want a real moon tan
We like the night, we want a real moonset
You keep the sun, we want a real mountain
We like the night, we want a real mountain
You keep the sun
We want a real moon tan
Moon tan
Moon tan
Real moon tan
