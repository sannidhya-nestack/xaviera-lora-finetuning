On a chilly Halloween night
Underneath the shining moonlight
Pumpkins glowing with a fiery delight
Spooky shadows dancing out of sight
Ghosts and witches take a flight
Skeletons glimming with all their might
Ghouls and monsters causing a fright
What a mystic, magical sight
Halloween, Halloween, it's a magical scene
With candy apples, kids so keen
Trick or treat, say with a beam
Oh how we love this Halloween dream
In the haunted houses, chilling screams echo
As spiders weave their webs below
Black cats prowl in eyes that glow
In this enchanted Halloween show
Bats in flight in the midnight glow
Secret whispers of a scarecrow
A realm where magic begins to flow
In the twilight's enchanting afterglow
Halloween, Halloween, it's a magical scene
With candy apples, kitsuki
Trick or treat, say with a beam
Oh how we love this Halloween dream
In the haunted houses, children's screams echo
As spiders weave their webs below
Black cats growl and eyes that glow
In this enchanted Halloween show
Bats in flight in the midnight glow
Sacred whispers of the scarecrow
A realm where magic begins to flow
In the twilight's enchanting afterglow
Halloween, Halloween, hear the creatures unsee
Work and madness on the scene, scene
Whispers in the dark, what do they mean?
It's all a part of the Halloween dream
As the night draws to an end and the magic begins to descend
We can hardly wait to spend another Halloween with our friends
With our friend
Ooh ooh ooh
Halloween, Halloween
It's a magical scene
With candy apples, kids so keen
Trick or treat, say with a feel
Oh how we love this Halloween dream
