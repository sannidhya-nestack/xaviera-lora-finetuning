In the shadows of the night where the pumpkins gain so bright
Trick or treat down the street under the ghostly moonlight
Skeletons creak, witches shriek, there's a chill in the air
Put on your mask or form the tassel then your spooky flare
Halloween, Halloween in the flicker of a night sheen
Spooky tales, ghostly wails in the realm of the uns
Halloween, Halloween where the eerie and the keen
Dance and twirl in the otherworld on the night of Halloween
Halloween, Halloween and the flicker of the night sheen
Spooky tales, ghostly wails in the realm of the unseen
Halloween, Halloween with the eerie and the keen
Dancing, twirling the otherworld on the night of Halloween
Vampires awake, let the evening quake
As the werewolves howl at the moon
Ghouls roam free in their ghostly spree
It's a creepy, kooky tune
Cobwebs shroud black cats are proud
In echoes of the twilight
Haunted halls where the spectre roams
Sing the shivers of the night
Halloween, Halloween
Catch a sight that's seldom seen
Curses cast shadows fast
It's a night of mystery and mean
Halloween, Halloween
When the scare's the routine
Join the rave in the graves
On this night of Halloween
As the night descends, the spectral suspense ends and the sun begins to beam
Wait another year for the fear and the cheer on the night of Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, it's a spectral frightful scene until we meet again
In the haunted glen, happy Halloween
Feyween
Vagween Halloween
At the year-ending quake as the werewolves holler the moon
Ghouls roam free in a ghostly spree
It's a creepy, kooky tune
Cowards shroud black cats are proud in the echoes of the twilight
Haunted homes where the specter roams in the shivers of the night
Halloween Halloween
Catch a sight that's seldom seen
Curses cast shadows past
It's a night of mystery and melo-ween Halloween
When the scare is the routine
Join the rave in the graves on this night of Halloween
As the night descends, the spectral suspense ends and the sun begins to beam
Wait another year for the fear and the cheer on the night of Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
It's a spectral frightful scene until we meet again
In the haunted glen, happy Halloween
Of the night
As the night descends, the spectral suspense ends and the sun begins to beam
