Late in the night, by the old stone tower
The moon does its dance, hour after hour
Echoing footsteps are chill in the air
Creeping shadows whisper, "Beware, beware"
In the valley of the shadows where the silence reckons play
On the nightmares and the echoes of an older, darker day
The spirits spin their haunting tune from the dusk to the break of day
In a symphony of shadows where the song goes back to sway
The Hall's haunting call under the sable sky
Carved stone angels their cold eyes never lie
Raven's wings clutter through the eerie spectral haze
A serenade from the spectral ballet in the moon's silver blaze
In the valley of the shadows where the silent specters sway
To the rhythm of the nighttime in the Quindosli ballet
The spirits sing a mournful song as time seems to decay
In a melody of moonlight under the shadows grey
In this kingdom of the cryptic
Under the haunted moon's cast
We move in the music of the macabre symphony from the past
Hush now, listen as the echoes slowly fade away
To the eternal encore of the morbid
