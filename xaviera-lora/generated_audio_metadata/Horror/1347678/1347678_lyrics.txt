Just past the gate where the shadows creep
A silly secret the house will keep
The floorboards groan and the windows sigh
A ghostly whisper floats on by
They're hiding under dusty beds
With happy grins on spooky heads
A playful boo, a little cheer
There's nothing scary, nothing to fear
It's Halloween, the bells all ring
The ghosts all dance and the skeletons sing
A haunted jig, a funny fright
Oh what a wonderfully spooky night!
Spooky night!
The bats fly out in a loopy line
The jack-o'-lanterns start to shine
A witch's giggle high and quick behind
A pile of candy sticks, a creaky chain
A rattling sound, a dozen spooky friends are all around
It's Halloween, the bells all ring
The ghosts all dance and the skeletons sing
A haunted jig, a haunting fright
Oh what a wonderfully spooky night
Spooky night
The lights go out, the wind howls loud
We're in the middle of a misty cloud
But then a cartoon scream rings out
And everyone just starts to shout
The fun is over, the magic's done
Until next year for everyone
(siren wailing)
