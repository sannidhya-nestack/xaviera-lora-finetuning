The circus tent, a funny sight
It came to town on Halloween night
The carousel turns with a spooky gleam
A phantom horse, a ghostly dream
The clowns all wave with painted smiles
As we walk for happy haunted miles
A little bad, a funny grin
Come on everyone and join right in
Oh, the fun fair's spooky and full of tricks
With monster rides and magic mix
The ferris wheel goes round and round
The silliest spookies can be found
The fortune teller with a glass ball
Predicts a giggle for one and all
The cotton candy glows so bright
A sweet surprise in the spooky light
You hear a boo and then a cheer
The fun is here, don't you have a fear?
Oh, the fun fair's spooky and full of tricks
With monster rides and magic mix
The ferris wheel goes round and round
The silliest cookies can be found
The lights go out, a sudden crash
The rides all stop in a ghostly flash
But then a happy monster sighs
And a pie goes flying in your eyes
The lights they fade away
Until the next Halloween day
