Underneath the pitch black sky where all life seems to die
Lingering whispers in the air, a chill runs as if a scare
Cobwebs hang from crooked trees, moonlight shining over the seas
And there in the dark, shadows embark
Halloween, the night of unseen
Dark ambience and echoing lament
Scream up, I'll scream nothing as it seems
Lost in the shadows where fear grows
Silhouettes on the misty ground
Spectral spirits all around
The wind carries their icy moans
Stories lost forever unknown
Spiders kiss, ravens caress
The symphony of the lifeless
Under the moon's hazy glow
Secrets only the dark and Halloween
The night so serene
Of every man upon screen
With luck for the shadowy gate
We celebrate the spooky, the arcane
Lost in the zone of the dark
Tonight, Halloween embarks
Silhouettes on the misty ground, spectral spirits all around
The wind carries their icy moans, stories lost forever unknown
Spires kiss, ravens caress, symphony of the lifeless
Under the moon's hazy glow, secrets only the dark know
Halloween, a night so serene
Dark and the end, echoing lament
Scream upon scream, nothing as it seems
Lost in the shadows, where fear grows
Silhouettes on the misty grounds but
Spirits all around, the wind carries their icy load
Stories lost, never unknown
Spires kiss, rain of caresse
Symphony of the lifeless, a symphony of doom under the moon
Hazy glow, secrets only the dark know
A spirit's only the dark
Tonight, the wind embarks
