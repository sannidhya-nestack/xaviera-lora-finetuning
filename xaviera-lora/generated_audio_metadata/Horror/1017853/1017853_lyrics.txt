You see them on the subway, just sitting there
Looking straight ahead, not breathing air
All in a row, and bombed from head to toe
They are the victims
They have lost control
They are the living bread
A mantle of porous lead
They are the living bread
Bloody their fall
Cold as ice, he'll steal a look at you
The worm is their leader and how he hates to lose
The live passion twists his morbid brain
Don't venture out alone in the dark and rain
They are the living bread
A mantle of porous lead
They are the living bread
Bloody their fall
Please tell me where you're going
I must know where you're going
Please tell me where you're going
I must know where you're going
They are the living bread
A mantle of voice lead
They are the living bread
Gothic tales of darkness you can't ignore
They'll come knocking at your chamber door
They'll eat the flesh right from your limbs
No one has ever escaped safe from them
They are the living dread
A mental forest lair
They are the living dread
Bloody their fall
