Halloween, Halloween, oh what a night (what a night)
Jack-o-lanterns glowing, oh what a sight
Ghosts and witches giving us a fright
It's Halloween, Halloween, I'll say goodnight
Bo-bo-bo, smokey fun (smokey fun)
Got our candies one by one (one by one)
Trick or treat, run, run, run
On Halloween under the moon and sun
Costumes on, masks so neat
Knocking doors, yelling trick or treat
Spiders, bats and owls, who?
Oh it's Halloween, let's fight the flute
Boo boo boo spooky fun
Gather candies one by one
Trick or treat run run run
On Halloween under the moon and sun
Costumes on, masks so neat
Knocking boards, feeling trick or treat
Spiders, bats and owls hoot
Oh, it's Halloween and let's play the flute
Boo, boo, boo, spooky fun
Gather candies one by one
Trick or treat, run, run, run
On Halloween under the moon and sun
So let's wave goodbye, Halloween's end is near
We've waited a whole year for this cheer
Don't be sad, let's give a cheer
For Halloween will again appear
