In the land where shadows creep
Where the pumpkins vigil keep
There's a witch's house so old
With secrets dark and tales untold
On Halloween Eve the spirits rise
Through mist and moonlight through darkened skies
The forest whispers the night is near
The witches cackle you'll surely hear
Ghostly figures roam the night bathed in the pale moon's eerie light
Candles flicker, windows creak, in the witch's house the secrets speak
Oh come all ye daring, gather close, in the witch's house where the shadows grow
Spirits dance and whispers flow, on Halloween Eve the magic sows
On Halloween Eve, the magic's so fake
Oh, sleigh figures roam the night
Bathed in the pale moon's eerie light
Candles flicker, windows creak
In the witch's house, the secrets speak
Oh, come all ye daring, gather close
In the witch's house where the shadows grow
Spirits dance and whispers flow
On Halloween Eve, the magic sows
Oh, come all ye daring gather close
In the witch's house where the shadows grow
Spirits dance and whispers flow
On Halloween Eve the magic sows
Hear the harp strike the witching hour
Feel the haunting's chilling power
Trapped within this festive spell
Dare you enter, you never can tell
Voices linger timeless tune, caught in the echo of the moon
The witch's house, a tale so old of Halloween, he forever told
Oh come all ye daring, gather close
In the witch's house where the shadows grow
Spirits dance and whispers flow
