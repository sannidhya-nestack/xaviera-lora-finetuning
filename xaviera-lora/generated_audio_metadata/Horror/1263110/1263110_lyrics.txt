In the heart of the night where the moon's light hides
Echoes of laughter from the other side
Through the hallowed hallways where spirits reside
The shadows dance and no secrets can abide
A melody untamed in this ghostly serenade
The echoes of the otten memories never fade
Fear not the whispers in the dark
For they are the lonely lullabies of twilight's lonely bard
Wandering through corridors of time lost
In the theater of the night every soul has a cost
Voices harmonize a chilling frost
Beneath the starless sky we are all tossed
The symphony unsung, reverberating among
The ruins of yesterday, the tales that are still young
Trade your fears for this nocturnal song
Remember in the dark we're where we belong
In the realm unseen where dreams intertwine
There's a place for the lost at the end of the pine
A spectral orchestra, their notes more than defined
