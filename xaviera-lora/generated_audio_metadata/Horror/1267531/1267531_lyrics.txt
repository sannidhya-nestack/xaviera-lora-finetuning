In the midnight shadows near the haunted glen lies the witch's cabin where the legends begin
Lanterns flicker softly'neath the moon's bright gaze
Whispers in the darkness in an eerie maze
Oh, it's the witcher's house where the spirits howl and the banshees rouse
Oh, on this Halloween Eve, what you see you must believe
Cobweb windows, secrets untold
Potions brewing, bubbling bold
Creaky floors and whispers light
Beware, beware the witch's sight
Ooh, it's the witch's house
Where the spirits howl and the bad she's roused
Ooh, on this Halloween Eve
What you see you must believe
Black cats plow the shadowy dance
Goers and goblins in a spectral trance
By the fire the witch does weave
Spells and charms on this haunting eve
Oh, it's the witch's house where the spirits howl and the banshees rouse
Oh, on this Halloween Eve what you see you must believe
Bats in the rafters, ghosts in the hall
Skeletons rattling, dancing in thrall
Bewitched and enchanted you may roam
But remember this is the witch's home
Ooh, it's the witch's house
