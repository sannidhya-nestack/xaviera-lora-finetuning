In the depth of the shadows where heartbeats tend to slow
A whispering wind in the night
Creating a tale of fright
Beneath the sky of eerie shade
Where the living prefer the dead
Ghouls and spectres come to play
Calorie is here, the dark is clear
No beef or fright, just hold your loved ones near
Dark and the hip whispers wrapped in fear
Close your eyes tight, yet keep your senses clear
From the twisted forest thicket, echoes a spectral cricket
Creeping fog shrouds the moon, playing Halloween's tune
In this world of the unseen, realms coalescing between
River of shadows stretching lean
Halloween's noise, a quiet voice
Dark ambient sounds, a spectral choice
In shadows rejoices, silence poised
The dead of the night finds its voice
As the eerie silence falls
Darkness beckons its calls
Halloween's enchanted nights
Under the frosty night
In the dark of the end holes wrapped in fear
Close your eyes tight, yet keep your senses clear
Under twisted forest thickets, echoes of spectral crickets
Creeping far trails the moon, playing Halloween's tune
In this world of the unseen, realms coalesce in between
River of shadows stretching lee
Halloween's noise, a quiet voice
Dark ambient sounds, a spectral choice
In shadows rejoice, the silence poised
The dead of the night binds its voice
As the eerie silence falls
Darkness begins its calls
Halloween's enchanted date night
Under the frosty night
In shadows rejoice, a spectral choice
In shadows rejoice, a silence voice
The dead are gone
