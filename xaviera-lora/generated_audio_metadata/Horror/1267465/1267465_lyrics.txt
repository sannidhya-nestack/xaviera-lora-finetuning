In a hollow there stands'neath the moon's eerie glance
A witch's old house-hued, a dust-shadowed dance
Its windows like eyes in the night they do peer
Where tales unsought whisper close to your ear
On Halloween Eve
When the veil's turning thin, the spirits arise
And their mischief begins with cackles and shrieks
The old witch does weave her spells in the air on this All Hallows Eve
The pumpkins alight with their grim, jagged grins
Guard pathways to secrets of old wicked sins
The black cats do purr with a gleam in their eye
As ghosties and ghoulies around you do fly
On Halloween Eve
When the veil's turning thin
The spirits arise
And their mischief begins
