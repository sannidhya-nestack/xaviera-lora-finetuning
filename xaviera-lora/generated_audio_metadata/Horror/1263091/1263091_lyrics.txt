In the grip of the night where shadows dance
Through cold stone halls in a ghostly trance
Even the bravest hearts falter and glance
Underneath the moon's spectral romance
There's a whisper in the wind that chills your skin
A harrowing tale of the ghost within
Sorrows melody, a symphony of sin
In the corners of your mind let the horror begin
Windows cracked with curtains that sway
Haunted echoes of an old ballet
Painted portraits with eyes of dismay
Silent spectators in this macabre play
A lullaby of dread in the midnight hour
Awakens ancient fears with consuming power
Through every forbidden corridor you scour
Seeking solace but the darkness devours
Monsters in the shadows, ghouls in the gloom
A sinister serenade foretells impending doom
In the eerie quiet of your silent tomb
The spirits rise to weave your loom
A symphony plays in the realm unseen
A requiem for the lost in a dream serene
The haunting spectre in the nocturne scene
Belongs to the haunted soul unclean
As the clock strikes twelve on all Hallows Eve
The spectral waltz begins to leave
Beware the dark and what it can conceive
For in this haunted night nothing is as it seems
