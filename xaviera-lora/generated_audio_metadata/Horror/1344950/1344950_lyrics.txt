Ding dong
Ding dong, witches sing
Boom crash, monsters ring
Ooh-ah
Can you hear?
Halloween is finally here
Ghosts go boo in the night
Pumpkins glow with candle light
Wolves are howling, chains go clink
Halloween is here, I think
Halloween
Spooky night
Shadows dance in pale moonlight
Halloween scream and play
Scary fun is here today
Doors go creak, the bats fly high
Thunder cracks across the sky
Owls are calling, winds go woo
Halloween belongs to you
Boo! Boo! Scream! Scream!
Halloween
Halloween (Halloween)
