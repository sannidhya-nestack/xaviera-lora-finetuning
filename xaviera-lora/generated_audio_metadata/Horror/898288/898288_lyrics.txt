Oh, I still don't see you, I still don't see you
Of the stars
Where are we?'Cause I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I am not, I am not, I am not, I am not, I am not, I am not, I am not, I am not, I am not
One last dance, one last dance, one last dance, one last dance, one last dance, one last dance, one last dance, one last dance, one last dance, one last dance, one last dance, one last dance, one last dance, one last dance, one last dance, one last dance, one last dance, one last dance, one last dance.
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah) (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah) (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,) (ah, ah, ah, ah) (ah, ah, ah, ah) (ah, ah, ah, ah) (ah, ah, ah) (ah, ah) (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah) (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-a-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, it's all right, it's all right
(Oh, so long)
