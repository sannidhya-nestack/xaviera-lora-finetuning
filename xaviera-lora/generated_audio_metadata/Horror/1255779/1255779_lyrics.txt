Oh, it's Halloween night
The ghosts are out of sight
But we'll just find that's in the night
Jack-o'-lanterns glowing so bright
Halloween, Halloween
Feel the spooky delight
Trick or treat down the street
In the cool crisp night
Halloween, Halloween
It's a magical sight
With silly costumes on
Oh, what a fun fright
Candy corn and chocolate treats
Bulls and goblins fill the streets
Smiles and laughter fill the air on Halloween
Oh, beware Halloween, Halloween
Now the moon shines bright
Stories don't hold on tight
In the soft moonlight
Halloween, Halloween
Full of fun and fright
Can't wait'til next year, oh what a night!
A fade through, I'm scared of the way
Wish you all a happy haunted Halloween day
