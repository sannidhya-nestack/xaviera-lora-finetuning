It's spooky night, it's Halloween
Ghosts and witches on the scene
Dressed up in costumes, oh what a sight
Under the glow of the moonlight
Halloween, Halloween, fun and scary
Candies and treats, both big and very merry
Knockin' on doors, shouting out loud
Trick or treat, we say feel it brown
Goblins grinning, vampires too
A haunted house, can we go through?
We laugh and giggle without a care
Halloween fun is everywhere
Halloween, Halloween, will you play?
Our favorite, favorite spooky holiday
We'll dance and sing until the dawn
And then Halloween will be gone
Goodnight Halloween, you brought so much joy
With all your candies, oh what a boy
We'll remember this night full of fun
Until next year when Halloween's begun
Halloween, Halloween, will you play? I'm scary
Candies and treats both make it very hairy
Knocking on doors, shouting out loud
Drink or treat, we say Felix Proud
Goblins, gritting, vampires too
A haunted house, can we go through?
We laugh and giggle without a care
Halloween fun is everywhere
Goblins grinning, vampires too
A haunted house can we go through
We laugh and giggle without a care
Halloween fun is everywhere
Goblins grinning, vampires too
A haunted house can we go through
We laugh and giggle without a care
Halloween fun is everywhere
Goodnight Halloween, you brought so much joy
With all your candies, oh what a ploy
We'll remember this night full of fun
Until next year when Halloween's begun
