It's a spooky night, oh what a sight
Pumpkins glowing, shining so bright
Ghosts say "Boo !" and bats fly by
Let's all dance under the moonlit sky
Spooky spooky Halloween
Dress up now, it's time to scream
Spooky spooky Halloween
Let's all have a spooky dream
Witches fly on broomsticks high
Owls go "Hoo !" and black cats cry
Monsters creep, but don't be scared
We're all friends in costume shared
Spooky spooky Halloween
Dress up now, it's time to scream
Spooky spooky Halloween
Let's all have a spooky dream
Candy, candy in my bag
Trick or treat, don't let it lag
Knock on doors and shout with glee
Happy Halloween to you and me
Spooky, spooky Halloween
Dress up now, it's time to scream
Spooky, spooky Halloween
Let's all have a spooky dream
Happy Halloween
