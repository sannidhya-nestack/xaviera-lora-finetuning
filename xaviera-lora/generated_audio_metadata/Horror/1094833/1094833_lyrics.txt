When you're trick-or-treating on Halloween night
You'll hear the dead leaves rustling up in the trees
And if you look closely, first left and then right
You may see the terrible gibu up there
He's shaped like a rather fat monkey I'd say
With an extra long tail, powerful tail
That could wrap right around you and steal you away
And as you approach in the twilight he lurks
He hears you come closer and he chuckles and smirks
Just waiting and then walk
His long tail wraps around your small chest
And he swings you up there next to him in his nest
And he snuggles beside you and says, "Trick or treat"
And you give him some candy which he quickly eats
And then he plants a big gebo kiss right on your nose
And you feel mighty strange from your head to your toes
And then he sets you down gently and you run away
But you hear him call
See you next Halloween day
When you're trick-or-treating on Halloween night
You'll hear the dead leaves rustling up in the trees
And if you look closely first left and then right
You may see the terrible gibu up there
Yes, you may see the terrible gebu up there
