In the depths of the forest where the shadows lie low
A house stands alone with a ghostly glow
Candles flicker in the windows, curtains drawn tight
Witches brew on the boil, it's Halloween night
Oh come to the witch's house, don't be shy
By the moonlit path where the ravens fly
With a cackle and a spell, she'll welcome you with
To her eerie abode, let the night begin
Jack-o'-lanterns grin with their sinister gleam
As the clock strikes twelve, it's a dark, wicked dream
Babs take flight with a deafening screech
Graveyard whispers in the wind, just out of reach
Oh, come to the witch's house
Be shy by the moonlit path where the ravens fly
With a cackle and a spell she'll welcome you in
To her eerie abode let the night begin
Cobwebs hanging loose and the floorboards creak
Spirits rise as the howling wolves speak
Cauldron bubbles over with the potion's mist
Fate awaits each child on the witch's list
Spooky tales unfold in the dead of night
With horrors untold by the lantern's light
Skeletons dance in a spectral parade
To the haunting melody the witch has played
Oh, come to the witch's house, don't be shy
By the moonlit path where the ravens fly
With a cackle and a spell, she'll welcome you into her eerie abode
