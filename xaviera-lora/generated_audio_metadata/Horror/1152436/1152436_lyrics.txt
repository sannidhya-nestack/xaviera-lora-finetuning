Here's a milestone rockin' party
Tomorrow we might feel like zombies
But tonight we're taking it to the grave
The music's thumpin', bass is bumpin'
Mommy jumpin', trillin' and poppin'
We can't wait to take your breath away
At the Boneyard Boogie (Boneyard Boogie)
Yeah, the Boneyard Boogie (Boneyard Boogie)
All vampires, wolfmen, ghouls and goonies
Everybody wanna do the Boneyard Boogie
That's right
"No more lies," says the stage
Witches cast their cares away
Crazy creepy crawlers spinning around
Newly dead, newly wet
Marchin' in that monster pit
Until that sun comes up, we're gettin' down
At the Boneyard Bouguet (Boneyard Bouguet)
Yeah, the Boneyard Bouguet (Boneyard Bouguet)
All the vampire woman goes in goodness
Everybody wanna do the Boneyard Bouguet
Oh, let me hear you scream
Ah, listen up now
You got skeletons them bringin'
It don't matter if they're breathin'
Everyone's invited to the dance
Spike that spirit in the punch
Ain't no rules, do what you want
That hot old place will keep you in a trance
Inside the Boneyard Buggy (Boneyard Buggy)
Yeah, the Boneyard Buggy (Boneyard Buggy)
All the vampire woodmen, ghouls, and goonies
Everybody wanna do the Boneyard Buggy
We're all Halloween obsessed
It's as spooky as it gets
And the nearest celebration that we'll never et
At the Boneyard Boogie (Boneyard Boogie)
Yeah, the Boneyard Boogie (Boneyard Boogie)
All the vampires, wolfmen, ghouls and goonies
Just can't wait to howl at the moon
His mind fired up to shake that booty
everybody wants to do the Boneyard Boogie
You've been a wonderful audience
Don't et to tip the man, ah-ah, boo
