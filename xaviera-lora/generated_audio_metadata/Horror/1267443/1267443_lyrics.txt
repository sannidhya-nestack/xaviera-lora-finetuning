On Hall Hallow's Eve when the moons aglow
The witch's house in the woods below
Where shadows dance and whispers creep
Awakens when the world's asleep
Oh, the witching hours come tonight
With candles flickering dimly bright
Come gather round, the fire's gleam
And hear the tales that haunt your dreams
In the witch's house where the cauldron brews
A spell is cast in midnight hues
Black cats prowl and ravens call
Echoes bounce off the ancient hall
Oh, the witching hours come tonight
With candles flickering dimly bright
Come gather round, the fires gleam
And hear the tales that haunt your dreams
The wind it howls, the spirits wail
A ghostly fog rolls down the trail
A pumpkin grins with fiery eyes
Guardian of the night's disguise
Witches laugh, a cackling sound
It chills your bones, it shakes the ground
But fear not children, heed this well
It's just a tale, a spooky spell
