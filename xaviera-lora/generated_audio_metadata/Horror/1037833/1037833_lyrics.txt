Something's lurking'round the corner
Something's creeping down the hall
Is there something peeking over my shoulder?
Is there anything at all?
It says "Boo-Boo"
It says "Boo-Boo"
Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo
Hey, anybody hear that?
Who's there knocking on my door?
I'm feeling like there could be some stranger (danger)
Or someone wants to settle the score
And say boo, boo, say boo, say boo, say boo
Noises in the attic, footsteps in the hallway
Squeaking in the floorboards, I think I better be on my way
Noises in the attic, footsteps in the hallway
Squeaking in the floorboards, I think I better be on my way
I hear something when I'm sleeping
Is there something hiding underneath my bed?
Or is there something coming from the closet?
So I pull the covers over my head
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Boo! (Boo!) Ah! (Ah-oooh!) (Ooooh!)
Wait a minute, there's something familiar
I know I know that, Boo
I think that spook's my brother
I know it's you!
Mom! Louie's scaring me again
Dude, it wasn't me, I swear, honest
(Scream) (Growling) (Evil Laughter) (Roar) (Evil Laughter) (Howl)
Boo!
