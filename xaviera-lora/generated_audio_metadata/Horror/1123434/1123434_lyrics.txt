We've got zombies on the sidewalk
Every corner, every street
Growling and groaning and stumbling about
Prowling round for someone to eat
Shaking doors and latches
They're trying to get in
Peering through the windows
With their hungry zombie grin
Hey
I don't need no zombies
Chasing after me
Well eat'em up yum yum
Round and round the tree
Well goody goody yum yum
Is all they see
I don't need zombies
Chasing after me
All zombies like to party
They can stay up all night
Zombie Morocco polo and the poolside food fight
Dancing zombie girls
Too much zombie wine
Dancing by herself, kid, or grew on eating someone's spine
But someday they're gonna get me
Well, I'm thinking you can't win every race you run
Someday they're gonna get me
someday I'll be the slowest one
You better run
Teach your baby how to run
You better run, run, run
Teach your baby how to run
Oh, out of the blocks, gone in a flash
Ready or not, it's a hundred yard dash
You better run, I'll teach you baby how to run
Hey, I don't need no zombies chasing after me
Well eat'em up yum yum
Round and round the tree
Well goody goody yum yum
Is all they see
I don't need zombies chasing after me
Don't ever let'em bite ya
Gonna die that zombie death, what's worse than that?
Gonna smell that zombie breath
