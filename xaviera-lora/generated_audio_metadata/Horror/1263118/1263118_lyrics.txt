Tales of your spawn in notes, a sonata of eerie sin
In the depths of your psyche, let the nightmare in
Windows sighing through the age, curtains in ten morbid sway
History is etched in hushed tones, pallid shades of grey
The portraits stare with haunted gaze, silent in their dismay
Witnesses to the spectral dance
In this morbid play of ears
Splitting silence as the witching hour nears
Each it fears are awakened
Consuming stirring fears
Discover truth, sound mysterious
