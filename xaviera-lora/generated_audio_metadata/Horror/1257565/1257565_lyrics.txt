Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
On a dark Halloween night
Underneath the moon's eerie light
Skeletons dancing, witches take flight
Everything's awake in the dead of the night
Halloween, Halloween on water's sight
Ghosts and goblins, creatures of the night
Trick or treating with faces of light
Candy and costumes with screams of delight
In the misty depths of the haunted maze
Echoes of laughter in a phantom haze
Pumpkin lanterns with their fiery gaze
Celebrating in an autumnal blaze
Halloween, Halloween, it's all in fun
Magic and mystery under the setting sun
Spooky spectacles have just begun
In the chilling air yet we feel the warmth
As the clock strikes twelve, it's time to free
Underneath the twisted ancient tree
Halloween, it'll always be
A night of magic, full of mystery
