In the glow of the moon so bright
Stirring shadows of the night
Creepy crawlies out of sight
On this spooky Halloween night
Halloween, Halloween
All the spooks are out on scene
Ghosts and goblins lean and mean
Tonight is their night, oh Halloween
Witches laugh and black cats growl
Underneath the night owls howl
Pumpkins screaming in a wall
Halloween's here with the dwelling jowl
Halloween, Halloween
Candy corn and treats, soaking trick
Or treat, let's make a scene
It's our time to shine, it's Halloween
Witches laugh and black cats growl
Underneath the night owls howl
Pumpkins grinning in a row
Halloween's here with a thrilling jowl
Halloween, Halloween
Candy corn and treats so cute, trick or treat let's make a scene
It's our time to shine this Halloween
Haunted houses, eerie sights
Skeletons dance in ghostly lights
Spiders spin their silks so white
It's Halloween night, oh what a fright
Halloween, Halloween
Scarecrows, stiff and witches lean in
Our costumes we convene to celebrate
Oh Halloween has come
The darkness takes the light
Keep your jack-o'-lantern burning bright
Until morning sun shines bright
Stay tight'til next Halloween night
