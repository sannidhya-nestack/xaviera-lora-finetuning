Halloween, Halloween, oh so fun
Ghosts and witches on the run
Pumpkins smiling in the sun
Halloween, Halloween, the joy has begun
Trick or treat, give me sweets
Walking down the spooky streets
Smiling faces, happy greets
On this night of Halloween feats
Costumes on, we're ready to go
Underneath the moonlight's glow
Door to door and row by row
Saying "boo" to those we know
Trick or treat, make it neat
A night of fun, isn't it sweet?
On Halloween there's no defeat
Just lots of candy to eat and eat
Halloween, Halloween, let's all shout
Full of fun without a doubt
With a cheer, let's say it out loud
Happy Halloween, let's spread the joy all about
Trick or treat, give me sweets
Walking down the spooky streets
Smiling faces, happy greets
On this night of Halloween feats
Costumes on, we're ready to go
Underneath the moonlight's glow
Door to door and row by row
Saying boo to those we know
Trick or treat, make it neat
A night of fun, isn't it sweet?
On Halloween there's no defeat
Just lots of candy
Say eat and eat
Halloween, Halloween let's all shout
Full of fun without a doubt
With a cheer let's say it out loud
Happy Halloween let's spread the joy all about
