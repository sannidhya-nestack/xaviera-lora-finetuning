Halloween is here today, dressing up ready to play
Pumpkins grinning in the night, giving everyone a little fright
Halloween, Halloween
It's not scary, it's just fun, ghosts and witches on the run
Knock knock, trick or treat, give us something sweet to eat
Candy, chocolates, oh so fine
Thank you, thank you, Halloween time
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
Full of laughs and silly screams
The best night in the land of dreams
With our lanterns shining bright
We stroll on through the night
Saying bye to all the spooks
Back to our beds with sleepy looks
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
What a lovely night it's been
Shadows fade and dawn is near
Goodnight Halloween, see you next year
Knock knock, trick or treat
Give us something sweet to eat
What a, uh, uh, uh
Candies, chocolates, oh so fine
Thank you, thank you, Halloween time
What a, uh, uh, uh
Halloween, Halloween
Full of laughs and silly screams
The best night in the land of dreams
With our lanterns shining bright
We stroll through the night
Say bye to all the spooks
Back to our beds with sleepy looks
Halloween, Halloween, what a lovely night it's been
Shadows fade and dawn is near
Goodnight Halloween, see you next year
