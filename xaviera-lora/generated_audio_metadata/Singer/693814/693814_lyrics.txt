I can still hear your laughter alone in my room
Where the TV and papers tell of only old news
Now I sit at this table and stare at the floor
Hoping you'll come back through the door
I've been hiding my feelings, saving my tears
But I can't stop running away from my fears
And I carry your picture around in my mind
How could you leave me behind?
Oh, you were the best thing in my life
There were words that I could never find
To ease your troubled mind
If I could turn back the pages, hold you in time
To you I'd mean everything, you'd still be mine
Now my days are all empty, nights are so long
How could things go so wrong?
And I remember the places that we used to go
And all of the good times that we used to know
They're all over and gone now, it hurts me inside
Why did you run and hide?
Paul, you were the best thing in my life
There were words that I could never find
To ease your troubled mind
Paul, you were the best thing in my life
There were words that I could never find
She's your troubled mind
