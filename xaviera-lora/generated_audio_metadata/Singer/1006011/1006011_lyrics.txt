Pack your bags, get out, is what he said
You're the worst that I've had
It must be something I did that made him rage like this
But if this is love then I don't wanna be his
He screams at me
He hits the wall, he never burns his tongue
he's right after all
And I shouldn't cry'cause crying makes it worse
One day I'll pack my bags and I'll come back
Get out is what you sell, now this is what you get
I can spend a lifetime fighting with you
And it feels like I'm living in a war between truth
Why is it so hard for you to say I'm sorry
All I'm hearing is your side of the story
And I can't say something bad'cause I'm torn inside
This time it isn't nothing for me to decide
He screams at me, he hits the wall
He never bites the stone'cause he's right after all
And I shouldn't cry'cause crying makes it worse
One day I'll pack my bags and don't come back
Get out as one yourself now this is what you get
I can't spend a lifetime fighting with you
And it feels like I'm living in a war between two
You are pushing me away
So stop fighting with me
You've been so careless and cold
Should I make up my mind?
One day I'll pack my bags and I don't come back
Get out is what you sell, my place is what you get
I can spend the lifetime fighting with you
And it feels like I'm living in a world with you
