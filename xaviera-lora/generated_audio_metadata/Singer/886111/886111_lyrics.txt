It's a twist on a romance, a worn out cliche
It's a movie you've seen, probably made
Spilling my guts out a window at night
And I remember what you said to the bedroom lamp
I've given you this tune
And I've sacrificed blood, not sure if you care
That sweet, gentle maiden, golden hair
You said you're following your bliss and how great that is
You said I know, I know, why does it hurt like this?
You said you're scared, you're brave, you're a coward, a hero
Like Neapolitan ice cream and frozen rainbow
I've given you this tune
And I've sacrificed blood, not sure if you care
And that sweet, genuine golden hair
Da da da da da da
That sweet gentleman golden hair
That sweet gentleman golden hair
Rise fair moon
