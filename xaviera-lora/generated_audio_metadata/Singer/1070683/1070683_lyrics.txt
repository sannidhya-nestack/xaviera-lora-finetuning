It's for real tonight
Under the colored lights
This place is alive
Here we go again one more time
Kickin' gravel
Out of my sandal
My stomach scrambled
Here we go again one more time
Spinnin' around on the outside
Of a circle
Are we having fun yet?
How can I say no
When you say let's go
Look out below
Flip it anyways right side up
So hold me steady
I think I'm ready
et what I said
Just flip it anyways right side up
Spinning around on the outside of a circle
Are we having fun yet?
Running around trying to catch it
Acting stupid if you can't get attention
You flip out past like a page of fiction
Proud and single cause probably a double
Cross my fingers I won't be much trouble
You never know until you try
Spinning around on the outside
How can I say no
When you say let's go, look out below
Flip it anyways right side up
So hold me steady, I think I'm ready
et what I said just flip it anyways right side up
Spinning around on the outside of a circle
Are we having fun yet?
Running around trying to catch ya
You act stupid to get your attention
You flip out past like a page of fiction
Proud and single just try it double
I'll cross my fingers there won't be much trouble
You never know until you try
Spinning around on the outside
Are we having fun yet?
Are we having fun yet?
Are we having fun yet?
Are we having fun yet?
