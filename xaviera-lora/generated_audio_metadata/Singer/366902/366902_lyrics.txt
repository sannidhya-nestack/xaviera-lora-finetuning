To say goodbye is not easy for me
I call your name but I get no answer
To say goodbye is really not easy for me
My heart is beating faster and faster
So much pain and so much sorrow
So much wasted on the way
So many words left unspoken
But there is nothing more to say
I wanna go home tonight
Home where I belong
I wanna go back where I came from
How can I say that I'm leaving
That I won't come back no more
Before I go and close the door
To say goodbye is not easy for me
I feel the sweat upon my skin
To say goodbye is really not easy for me
I close my eyes and let the darkness in
I'm leaving the scene, the director is gone
The curtain falls behind me
The lights go out, I take off my wig and start to cry, silently
All I can do is wish you well, so have a good time
I hope that now you're feeling fine
And maybe you don't understand
Oh but I have no choice
Hope you hear that sadness in my voice
To say goodbye is not easy for me
While there is tenderness in the air
To say goodbye is really not easy for me
While there is nothing more to share
No self approaches, no responsibility to take
No more silent tears to cry and no more lonely hearts to break
I've been talking of destiny
And that it has to be
What all did come to you and me
The wind has changed direction
Clouds in the southern sky
That's all I can do is say goodbye
