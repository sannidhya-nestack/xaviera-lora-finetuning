We fall into the snow
I feel there's something you need to know
All these feelings inside
Cannot hide
Out in the cold
Your cheeks begin to redden
There's nothing left to find
We've found our own piece of heaven
We've fallen to this scene
Everything seems far from belief
We belong here
We fall into this dream
Every moment a sight unseen
You and I, love
Out in the cold
Your cheeks begin to red
There's nothing left to find
We found our own piece of heaven
I could never leave you here alone
I kneel down on my knees for love
Out in the cold
Your cheeks begin to redden
There's nothing left to find
We've found our own piece of heaven
Out in the cold
Your cheeks begin to redden
There's nothing left to find
We've found our own piece of heaven
