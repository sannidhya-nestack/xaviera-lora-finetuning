Sometimes the memory fades
Reminds you it never changed
Now that it's lost in the world
Seeing as nothing can bring back a time
We're all losing lives
Oh, and these lovers caught in the past
Some rediscover, but that love never lasts
Oh, and these lovers just caught in the past
Caught in the past
Everything's falling apart
Wish that we knew from the start
Nothing is written in stone
And we're all alone in the choices we make
And our mistakes
