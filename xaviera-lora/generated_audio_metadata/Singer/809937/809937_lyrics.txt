I need you, you need me
I love you, you love me
I need you, you need me
I love you
We got to, we got to take our time now, yeah
every
We need to, we need to take a step back, uh-huh
Just to take it all in
And all this, and all this running around, yeah
Just makes my head spin
And if we, and if we can stay true
We'll feel better about ourselves
Sometimes you've got to fight to be understood
Sometimes you've got to make it on your own
But I'll try to be there for you
Because that's what we do and I'll do it for you
We're gonna get through this together
We're gonna make it all our own
We're gonna get through this together
We're gonna make it all our own
We can take it slow, I know
We can open up the door
And we realize how much more life we have
We get a sense of knowing where we're going and why
Sometimes you've got to fight to be understood
Sometimes you've got to fake it on your own
But I'll try to be there for you
Because that's what we do and I'll do it for you
We're gonna get through this together
We're gonna make it on our own
We're gonna get through this together
We're gonna make it on our own
