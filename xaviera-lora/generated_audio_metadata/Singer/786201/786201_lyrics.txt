I just want your love
It's all I'm dreaming of
And take me to your home
Let me settle down
I want your touch
Your hands against my skin
Lay by your side
When we wake in the morning
I just need to find
My own peace of mind
So I don't crumble down
Risk a ruin in this town
I need your kiss
Brush your scented lips
Don't leave me here when we wake in the morning
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-Da
Da-da-da-da-da-Da
Da-da-Da-Da-Da-Da
Da-Da
Dora, Dora, Dora!
