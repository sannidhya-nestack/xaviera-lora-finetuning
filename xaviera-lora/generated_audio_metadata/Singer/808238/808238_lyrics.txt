I have a white cat biting my toes
He wakes me up at dawn
He tells me it's time to go
He tells me it's time to walk on my own
He tells me life is simple if you just try to let go
I have a white cat biting my toes
I have a white cat sleeping on my chest
It makes me stay right here, a place where I can rest
It makes me realize that I'm so blessed
It makes me dream of you and your beautiful face
I have a white cat sleeping on my chest
I have a white cat playing with a ball
He wants me to play with him until the night falls
He shows me a way to enjoy my time
He shows me a way to see beyond these narrow walls of mine
I have a white cat playing with me tonight
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
