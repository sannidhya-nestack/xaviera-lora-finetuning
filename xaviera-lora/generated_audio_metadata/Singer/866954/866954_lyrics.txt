Does your heart break like the shipwrecks
And wash up on the shore
Well beyond that vague stability
That leaves you wanting more
Well if it does
Please come home again
And are your eyes the only windows ever peering from your soul?
And are they shattered by compulsiveness that makes you feel alone?
Well they may close when you come home again
And when you're on a bleeding edge
And when your words are finally spent
You'll know there's love so safely wedged
And it'd be heaven sent if you came home again
When your fate is held for ransom by your thoughts and memories
And when your footprints are the hostage to responsibilities
We'll set them free when you come home again
When your head hangs low and heavy
With your reflection at the ground
And when your smiles are cold and faded
Recollection of a frown
It won't be long
Till you come home again
And when you're on the bleeding edge
And when your words are finally spent
You'll know there's love so safely wed
And it'd be heaven sent if you came home again
And when you're on the bleeding edge
And when your words are finally spent
Oh, you'll know there's love so safely wed
And it'd be heaven sent if you came home again
It would be heaven sent if you came home again
