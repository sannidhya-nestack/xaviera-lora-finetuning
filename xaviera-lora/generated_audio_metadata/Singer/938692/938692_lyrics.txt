Blurry minds, batting hearts, staring at the sun
Done with lies, scaring tales
We stand before life
Maybe we are the ones
Maybe the day has come
To lift the heavy veil
For us to make a strike
I will wait for the low tide
I don't fear what we find
It's our chance to be untied
Hiding out made us blind
We are free, we are safe tonight
We are right and I think it's time
To illuminate the past
Memories will remain
We just can't et
So let go, breathe again
Just can't ease the pain
I will wait for the low tide
I don't fear what we find
It's our chance to be untied
Hiding out made us blind
We are free (we are free) we are safe tonight (we are safe tonight)
We are right (we are right) and I think it's time (time) to eliminate
We left a place where no dreams belong
They thought they could crush our youth
From here it's safe, the wind blows again
I know that we'll thrive
We are free, we are safe tonight
We are right and I think it's time
We are free, we are safe tonight
We are right and I think it's time
