Never close those blue eyes, let them sing their sad melody
I'm trying hard to lose a feeling, but it's got a hold on me
Now your picture's faded
The borders are rusty, but I'll play it for free
You told me about a princess, how she lost her way
So I asked you to come with me, when I had the freedom to stay
You've got to do something
So you don't et how it feels to regret
But it wasn't me that lit that spark
That left me here so cold and unmarked
And it wasn't me that lit the dark
It was you lady, not Joan of Arc
I wish you'd close those blue eyes, or just turn around
I know she's not you, but she's got that same lonely sound
It's winter here now, and my nights are dark
But I play this part
That it wasn't me that lit that spark
That left me here so cold and unmarked
That it wasn't me
I lit the dark
It was you lady
Or Matt Joan of Arc
Oh it wasn't me
I lit that spark
Oh that left me here
So cold and unmarked
And it wasn't me
I lit that dark, it was you lady, I'm at your walk
