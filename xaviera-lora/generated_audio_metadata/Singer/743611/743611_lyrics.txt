Leaving so angry, slamming the car door
Covered with blankets, playing hide and seek
Dreaming awake and lying on the floor
Yeah, the magic that was you and me
Call me while played at night, just to hear your voice
Tell me how much you have missing me
Hours and hours talking on the phone
Just to hear you breathe
And I don't know what you've been thinking
I don't wanna change
'Cause you know we might need
Some time to heal our minds
All that I know is that you can count on me
I've been giving my best and so do you
Baby I know no love is free
I'm counting the days to meet you
I'll tell you what I've been on my mind
And I am so glad to see you
But it's just that I wanna do it all the time
And I don't know what you've been thinking
I don't wanna change
Cause you know we might need some time to heal our minds
All that I know is that you can count on me
I've been giving my best and so do you
Baby I know, yeah
I don't know what you've been thinking
Just that I don't wanna change
Am I the only one who feels this way?
Knowing my need
All that I know
You know we might need
Some time to heal our minds
All that I know
Is that you can count on me
I've been giving my best
And I'm sold to you and baby I know, yeah
Cause you know we money, you know we money
You know we money, yeah
(Na na na na na na na na na)
Slam the car door
(Na na na na na na na na)
Playing hide and seek
(Na na na na na na na na)
Lying on the floor
(Na na na na na na na na)
Tell you what I've been on my mind
Tell you what I've been on my mind
Tell you what I've been on my mind
I'll tell you what's a thing on my mind
Tell me what's a thing on my mind
Tell me what's a thing on my mind
