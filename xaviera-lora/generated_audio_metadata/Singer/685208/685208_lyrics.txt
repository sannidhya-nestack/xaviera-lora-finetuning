See I got friends waiting for the undead
To bring the apocalypse with shotguns in hand
Mapped out escape routes and grand battle plans
Printed and publicized
A second self with a sickness and binary sequence
Designed to be host by your hand
No tip of the tongue
Permission to live
With a flesh eaters walk in the earth
With a high speed connection and social intentions to burn
And the wakes up in cascade what more could you ask it for
Put the service on facebook your friends could invite a few more
All day long, automated, oh
All day long, automated
And out of my comfort zone, everywhere I go
they're all around me, walking like soulmates
No one's paying attention
Distractions and tension
This is where it starts
Where they came to get Barbara
And seek shelter in sharpened lungs
We've already turned and become what we are
In a movable object with a child's intellect and firearms
And the hunger will grow until it's off with their heads
From cold cold men collected cold men calculated instead
Carry brains in your hands
Become inseparable loves
If no scream incomplete
I'm infected now with this disease
And the brains become all that you need
Cause it's what makes the pain go away
So much easier than a real face
And I'm with no escape plan
But one great Pacific plastic island
All, all day long, automated, all
All day long, automated
And out of my comfort zone, everywhere I go
they're all around me, walking like zombies
No one's paying attention, distractions and tension
All day long, automated
All and every song
Automated, automated, automated
