Oh come a little closer babe I'll tell you what's on my mind
This is the strangest feeling I've had in quite some time
I don't know your name but I feel I know you my whole life
I felt you reach out and touch me and I felt your burning eyes
Could you be the one to make me want to settle down
Could you be the one to make me want to stick around
Oh could you be the one
Yeah could you be the one
Oh could you be the one
Oh baby could you be the one
I took my loving on a run babe for quite some time
But now it boils me to death and it sure don't keep me satisfied
And in the morning I'll be gone with a cloud lingering over my head
And by noon I'm gone from your memories and staying in your bed
Could you be the one to make me want to settle down
Could you be the one to make me want to stick around
Oh could you be the one
Oh could you be the one
Oh could you be the one
Tell me darling
Or could you look me in the eye baby and I feel you had to look away
And could you trust me on the road could you see me as a daddy someday
And all the thoughts you got me thinking stop my shit from slowly sinking in a blinking overnight
And I'm no longer so hung up so let's hang out and baby baby give it a try
Could you be the one to make me want to settle down
Could you be the one to make me want to stick around
Oh could you be the one
Could you be the one
And I'm alone but I ain't lonely I got friends most every place I go
And I'm begging you to write me baby so many things I need to know
And I'm dreaming bout the smell of your hair and the feel of your lips
And I'm dreaming bout the way you shake that body baby the way you move them hips
Could you be the one to make me want to settle down
Could you be the one to make me want to stick around
Oh could you be the one
Oh baby please be the one
Oh babe you gotta be the one
Got to be the one babe
Got to be the one
