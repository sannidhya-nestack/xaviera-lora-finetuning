I got diamonds in my eyes and treasure in my sight
I'm setting sail for foreign shores
The promise of eternal life on the bright horizon light
That's what I'm searching for
But I know one man can change the world, I know
And they thought that Troy could never fall
By Achilles sword those crumbled walls
Kept his legend shining through
And I know the world is full of gold
You told me I could have it all
And no one knows me like you do
Of all the things I left behind
In the hope that I would find
A heartbeat in my chest
You're the one I love the most
And no one knows if I'll see you again
That's the price I have to pay, I know
But I've gotta take this chance'cause no one said we're coming back
I've never spoken words so true
You said that if we learn to fly then in this world we'll never die
And no one knows me like you do
I've got the world in my arms
And I hope I can bring it back for you
I've got the world in my arms
And I hope you see it all
And they thought that Troy could never fall
By Achilles sword those crumbled walls
Kept his legend shining through
And I know the world is full of gold
You told me I could have it all
And no one knows me like you do
And now I've gotta take this chance
no one said we're coming back
I've never spoken words so true
You said that if we learn to fly then in this world we'll never die
But no one knows me like you do
No one knows me like you do
No one knows me like you do
No one knows me like you do
Ooh
