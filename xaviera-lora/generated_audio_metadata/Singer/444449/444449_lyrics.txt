Papa was a preacher and a teacher but he never prayed
He told me all the things I shouldn't do and when I shouldn't say
Mama was a sister but she never broke the golden rule
So give me all the things I'll ever need and probably never use
Hey yo, was there ever any doubt?
Hey yo, we used to scream and shout
Hey yo, was there ever a time to say?
Hey yo, run around the ring yeah
One day my brother David joined the Navy and he went to sea
He told me about the people that he tried to help but didn't see
My father told me someday one day I would be a man
And even though it's hard
I'll do the best I can, yeah
Hey-yo, was there ever any doubt?
Hey-yo, we used to scream and shout
Hey-yo, was there ever time to sing?
Hey-yo, run around the ring, yeah
Hey-oh, was there ever any doubt?
Hey-oh, we used to scream and shout it
Hey-oh, was there ever a time to say?
Hey-oh, run around the rink, yeah
