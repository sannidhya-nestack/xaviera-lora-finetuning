Hello sunshine, what do I call you? You've come to light my way
You've come to warm me, to keep me safe From the darkness that follows you around
The moon is welcome
Oh, it tries so hard
To impress when you're not around
The stars are welcome
They keep me entertained
I almost know each one by name
The sun, the moon and all the stars
In orbit around my life
Keep me dancing, oh, keep me
Keep me dancing, heaven knows
Hello darkness, where will you sit?
You won't need to stay very long
How can I help you?
I'm not the one you want
She's gone, she said she's moving on
The sun, the moon and all the stars
In orbit around my life
Keep me dancing, oh
Keep me up on my toes
Keep me dancing, heaven knows
The sun, the moon and all the stars
It orbits around my life
Keep me dancing, oh
Keep me
Keep me dancing, heaven knows
Keep me dancing, oh
Keep me over my toes
Keep me dancing, heaven knows
