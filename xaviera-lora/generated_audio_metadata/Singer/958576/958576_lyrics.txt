Initially it's chemistry and cortisol that make me fall
Biology, adrenaline, and dopamine I lose it all
Officially we see decrease in all my melatonin
That's psychology of OCD hopped up on serotonin
No my brain don't fool around
And I ain't ever coming down
You know I don't suppose you know
How it feels when oxytocin grows
Your head and heart collide
And you can't change your mind
And though you got an A in your anatomy
Your heart was undefined
Attachment built upon attraction
And I cannot control my actions
But if it's in my veins
Then why am I to blame
To channel all that energy
And by suppressing cleverly
Is harder than you think it'd be
Through your insecurities
But E equals MC heart
When you and me start to fall apart
Well you know I don't suppose you know
How it feels when oxytocin grows
Your head and heart collide
And you can't change your mind
And though you got an A in your anatomy
Your heart was undefined, oh
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Do do do do do do do (fall in love)
Do do do do do do do (fall in love)
Do do do do do do do (fall in love)
Well come and get it, well come and get it
Well come and get it, you will never get it, love
Come and get it, come and get it
But you've got to come to me, I don't suppose you know
How it feels when oxytocin grows
Your head and heart collide
And you can't change your mind
And though you got an A in your anatomy
Your heart was undefined
I don't suppose you know
How it feels when oxytocin grows
Head and heart collide
And you can't change your mind
And though you got an A in your anatomy
Your heart was undefined
Hey, it's all misunderstood
Yeah, but it does your body good
