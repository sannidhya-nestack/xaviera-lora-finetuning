I wouldn't change nothing about my past
And times have been bad but they don't last
And all the happy outweighs the sad
I'm so glad
And all the precious moments we had
They're just like pictures from an ad
Keep a collection and you'll be sad
Just be glad
Pick up your head and look what's around
This is a wonder, wonderland
This is a wonder, wonderland
We're living a wonder, wonderland
We live in a wonder, wonderland
And baby I know what you're thinking
This whole world keeps on a sinking
And I've been drinking for a while
Because it makes me smile
Pick up your head and look what's around
This is a wonder
Wonderless all in how you look at things
Dead seas don't cry, wonders over
Just smile cause we're living a wonder
Wonderless all in how you look at things
We're living a wonder, wonders over
Just smile'cause it happened, yeah
It's all the feeling that you have
It's all the voices in your head
It's all the feeling that you have
It's all the voices in your head
It's all the feeling that you had
It's all the voices in your head
