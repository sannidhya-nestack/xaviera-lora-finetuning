Ocean breeze carries me
And the tide brings me home
And when I find you again, in the night innocent
Faint smell of the sand and the sea and the wind
Can't you tell that I miss you?
As good times roll by
We used to dance by the vista
On the beach at high tide
So I can't stop the winter time but summer's coming soon
This how you make me feel you're my sun and moon
Can't stop the winter time but summer's coming soon
Miss how you make me feel, you're my sun and moon
The planets will step in line, you'll be on my mind
Bonfires blazing the night
And I'll see there's life under this blanket sky
The ocean breathes like you and me
Days will mess around with your mind and then you'll know
You will blow cold into bomber
And people who are happy they don't know the difference
Love is all that's on their mind
Can't stop the winter time but summer's coming soon (ooh ooh ooh)
This how you make me feel, you're my silent moon
Can't stop the winter time but summer's coming soon (ooh ooh ooh)
This how you make me feel, you're my silent moon
Can't stop the winter time but summer's coming soon
This how you make me feel you're my silent moon
Can't stop the winter time but summer's coming soon
This how you make me feel you're my silent moon
