Two feet on the baseball and the night is getting cold
I swear I didn't mean it when I said I was better off coming here alone
So I count my dollars as I get to the bottom of this empty whiskey glass
This here love's like a liquor, it goes down bitter but it's sweeter when it lasts
So don't you worry about me, no, no
You know I don't need nothin' if I'm standin' on my feet
And there's a fork in this road where it leads, well I don't know
But I hear music in the distance, hey yeah, hey yeah
So the distance I will go
One hand on the wheel and the engine's humming low
The highway sings its lullaby, I've got miles left to go
Headlines carry me back to where I belong
home is just where somebody still loves you when you're wrong
So don't you worry about me, no, no
You know I don't need nothin' if I'm standin' on my feet
And if that's my ship comin' in to the harbor
Well, I don't know, but I hear music in the distance
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah
So the distance I will go
Two feet on the concrete,'cause I still can't fall asleep
Just waiting on the day where I can cut these chains and chase that melody
So don't you worry about me, no, no
You know I don't need nothin' if I'm standin' on my feet
And I see all these bridges burnin' right behind me
Yes, I know, but I hear music in the distance
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, ay
I hear music in the distance, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So the distance I will go
