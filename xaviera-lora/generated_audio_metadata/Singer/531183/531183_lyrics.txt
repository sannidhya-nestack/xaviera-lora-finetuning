Do you still pretend?
Are you still alone?
Do you still believe
That you can never leave
All is now safe-kept inside
All, all is now safe-kept inside
Safe-kept inside
Are you caught in a loop
Are your days all the same
Can you cope with the shame
Are you always afraid?
All, all is now safe-kept inside
All, all is now safe-kept inside
All, all is now safe-kept inside
Safe cats inside
All, all, all is now
Safe cats inside
But who's left outside?
