Finding time can be so hard
We've got calendars filled up with words that push us both apart
For you I'd wipe mine sparkling clean
'Cause you matter, you matter to me
You matter to me like a spring honeybee
To a dew in a blossoming flower
you are to me
Melody
You matter, you matter to me
Can't hear your own voice in the crowd
You say that they don't care
You're just a number on a plastic card
That noisy world out there can't see
That you matter, you matter to me
You matter to me
Like a spring honeybee
To a dew in a blossoming flower
you are to me
Like a sweet melody
You matter, you matter
To me
Count your steps to me
I'm waiting here so patiently
You matter to me like a spring honeybee
Do or do in a blossoming flower
'Cause you are to me like a sweet melody
You matter, you matter to me
You matter to me
