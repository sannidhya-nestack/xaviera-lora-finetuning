I was taken away from my brothers
I was taken away from my friends
And now we just pray for each other
I pray to go back
Sometimes I still see my mother
She appears in my dreams like a flame
She tells me to care for each other and that's all she says
There are times when the sky seems so blue
There are times when I'm not so afraid
But then I see that we hurt each other
We blame each other time and time again
And that's what I see, we abandon each other
We betray each other again
And again
When I first arrived on this island
I thought I was born again
I thought my journey was over
But I see no end
There are times when the ocean's so clear
And my darkness inside drifts away
But then I see
We still hurt each other
We still blame each other
Time and time again
And that's what I see
We abandon each other
We betray each other
Again
And again
There are times when the sky seems so blue
There are times when I'm not so afraid
But then I see we still hurt each other
We still blame each other time and time again
And that's what I see
We abandon each other
We betray each other again
And again
I had to leave all my brothers
I had to leave my homeland
And now we just pray for each other
We pray
To go back
