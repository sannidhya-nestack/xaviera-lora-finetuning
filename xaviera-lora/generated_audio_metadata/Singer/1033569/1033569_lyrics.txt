Ask anybody about me, I don't give in so easily
Don't you know that would be a no-no
You got me turned all around, inside out and upside down
I don't know which way I oughta go
When you smile, I'm intoxicated
So complicated, what'd you do to me?
Why do I, why do I, why do I do all the things I
Why do I, why do I, why do i do all the things I
Why do I
Why do I do all the things I do? (Why do I do all the things I do?)
Why do I do all the things I do? Mm-mm, yeah
Like a high school girl with butterflies
Check my phone like a billion times
Woah oh, can I get a, oh no
Oh my god did I just say
I like to snuggle on rainy days
Oh no, it's out of control
You see right through me
Baby I can't fake it
Captivated, what'd you do to me?
Why do I, why do I, why do I do all the things I
Why do I, why do I, why do I do all the things I
Why do I do all the things I do? (Why do I do)
Why do I do all the things I do?
You say I'm beautiful
I'm falling fast
So why can't I just let go?
Why do I, why do I
Why do I do all the things I
Why do I do, why do I do all the things I
Why do I do, why do I do all the things I
Why do I
