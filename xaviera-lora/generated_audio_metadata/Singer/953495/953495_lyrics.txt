A ghost before you die
And like a fool in the cold
I held you in the light
To keep you warm outside
Are you really gonna run away from it now?
Footprints in the snow
Can I feel your hands reaching out to me now?
All I have to give you
Are the clouds
Once you're out of sight
Like the moon on its way
Reflecting on the night
A memory cold on its own
Are you really gonna run away from it now?
Footprints in the snow hole
Can I feel your hands reaching out to me now?
All I have to give you are the clouds
Oh, to know you, to know you, to know you, to know you
Oh, to know you, to know you, to know you, to know you
To know you, to know you, to know you, to know you
To know you, to know you, to know you, to know you
To know you (I wonder)
To know you (I wonder)
To know you (I wonder)
To know how you screwed up girl
I wonder (to know you)
I wonder (to know you)
I wonder (to know you)
To know you (I wonder)
To know you (I wonder)
To know you (I wonder)
To know how you screwed up girl
I wonder (to know you)
I wonder (to know you)
I wonder
Are you really gonna run away from it now?
Footprints in the snow
Can I feel your hands reaching out to me now?
All I have to give you
Are the clouds
