Hello sun, it's good to see you again, skies are blue, birds are chirping, I'm feeling good, I got the radio on singing
Sing along to my favorite song
The guy in front of me slams on his brakes
My coffee spills all over the place
My boss is calling and now I'm late
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's live for a movie, oh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
With a nice happy ending, oh
No need for an intro, they're always too long
And the middle drags on and on and on
Let's fast forward to boy meets girl
Boy meets girl
I used to have a guy
Who loved me no matter what
Threw it in my hair
Skirt tucked in my butt
Put Johnny Depp
Part Ryan Gosling
He likes Twilight
And he makes my heart sing
But who am I kidding?
My life's a mess
I can't pay my bills
Gotta spay and oil my dress
I'm falling apart
I must confess
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, it's life for a movie
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, with a nice happy ending, oh
No need for an intro, they're always too long
And the middle drag's on and on and on
That's fast floor, it's a boy meets girl
I said, "Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
It's life for a movie, oh, ooh
Ooh, but the lines have the ending, oh-oh-oh
Only for an intro, they're always too long
And the middle drags on and on and on
Let's fast forward to boy meets girl
Boy meets girl, mm-hmm
Boy, boy, boy meets girl, mm-hmm
