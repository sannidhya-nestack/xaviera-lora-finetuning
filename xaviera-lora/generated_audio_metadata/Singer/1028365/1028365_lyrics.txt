I have traveled and searched the universe
Just to find you here, sitting next to me
And this moment, the energy you emit
Moves through me as the ground
Love sinks under my feet
Golden sun rays reflecting in your eyes
Your skills are working, oh yes, I'm your prize
I am never too old to dream and live high
If I am intoxicated by you
Or buy this wine, I will take it all on board
And pray to be wise on the horizon in front of us
Our summer of heat and spice
When a good journey becomes a great journey
When good music is the best music
It's the first stage of our crash phase
When you are my shining star
I'm your star and I'm imagining this dream never stops
Let's keep going, oh let's not get off
Oh I am never
Too old to dream and live high
If I am intoxicated by you or by this wine
I will take it all on board
And pray to be wise on the horizon in front of us
Our summer of hate and spice
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I, I, I, I want my time with you
I, I, I, I want my time with you
I, I, I, I want my time with you
I, I, I, I want my time with you
