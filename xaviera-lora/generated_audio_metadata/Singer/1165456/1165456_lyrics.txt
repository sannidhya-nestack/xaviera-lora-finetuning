I don't know but I suspect it started with a glance
Lock your eyes a second time and calculate your chance
Maggie was a widow from Brush Valley raising two
Cowork passed her house each day
I wonder when she knew that first look back
That's the one
That first look bad, that's the one
Randy stood up on that stage, the drummer counting four
Linda drank with all her friends, the two-step round-the-clock
It wasn't much to notice'til he sang her favorite song
Music loud and whiskey warm, inhibitions gone
That first look back, that's the one
That first look back, that's the one
Larry stopped for breakfast every Friday after work
Kathy worked the graveyard shift, the food was just a perk
Given poor conditions, lonely souls commiserate
Recognize the bargain, recognize your fate
That first look back, that's the one
That first look back, that's the one
That first look back, that's the one
That first look back, that's the one
