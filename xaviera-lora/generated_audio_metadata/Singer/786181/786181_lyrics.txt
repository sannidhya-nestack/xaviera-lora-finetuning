There was once a man of Liverpool who stood along the street
With a violin at hand and a cap beside his feet
Boats were barely caught in one so he fell to the ground
What a sad day that it was when no fiddle could be found
What a sad day that it was when no fiddle could be found
Cemented in the history of a prosperous Dublin town
Where a Bill would face his struggle with the crowds that he'd seen now
You're just a joke with a Morrison's bag and you feel it makes you squeal
Ever push back into the corner out on Bow Street
Ever push back out in the corner out on Bow Street
What a sad day that it was when no fiddle could be found
What a sad day that it was when no fiddle could be found
What a sad day that it was when no fiddles could be found
What a sad day that it was when no fiddled could be found
