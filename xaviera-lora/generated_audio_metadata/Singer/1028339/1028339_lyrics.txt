How long have I waited?
I'm waiting still
I'd wait a thousand lifetimes
For you to change your mind again
Another day has left me
The summer's almost gone, all gone
I can hear the fall whisper
And the shadows on the hill are growing long
And I'm alone
How long will I go on waiting so sweet
But bitter on my tongue
One word can bring me down or save me
And everyday without you I burn
How long
You call me in the night time
And come into my bed
My candles still burning
Just before morning
You're leaving again
And then you look right through me
As if I was not there
Your silence taunts me
The taste of you haunts me
Acting as if you're unaware
How long will I go on waiting?
So sweet, but bitter on my tongue
One word can bring me down or save me
And every day without you I burn
I should have learned
In between's no place to be
She is cruel and I'm such a fool
But she's the needle in my skin and I'm wanting her again
Oh no, no, no
How long will I go on waiting so sweet?
My bitter on my tongue
One word can bring me down or save me
And everyday without you I burn
How long?
How long have I waited? I'm waiting still
