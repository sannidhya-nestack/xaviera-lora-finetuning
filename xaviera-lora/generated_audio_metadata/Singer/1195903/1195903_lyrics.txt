You know I can't et her
No no no one's ever looked so sublime
So in love and helpless
I'm obsessed I confess she's all that's on my mind
These feelings have taken, that's all on me
I'm falling
My heart is on fire
And I know that she knows
She's my undying desire
And I know that she knows
She's a prize, there's no doubt
I can't get the words out, I'm so tongue-tied
I feel my grip is slippin'
Head and body trippin', it happens every time
Sexy, sweet as a honey tree
I'm fallin'
My heart is on fire
And I know that she knows
She's my dying desire
And I know that she knows
I get so high
I can't live without her, no, no, no, whoa, whoa, whoa
My heart is on fire
And I know that she knows
She's my undying desire
And I know that she knows
I get so high
I get so high
I get so high
Get so high
