Say you went last night just to be there
With all the lights left on like a halo for your hand
It makes me scream
Dream it once over
Like you're in
Untold or sober
Is it true? Was it you?
Was it like you once imagined?
Look me in the eyes just one more time
It's hard to meet your gaze but it's worthy and it's kind
It makes me scream
Dream it once over
Like you're in
Untold or sober
Is it true? Was it you? Was it like you once imagined?
