You make me feel special
You're precious and gentle
But never judgemental in your ways
You hold me up so high
I don't even know why
You make me feel so fly everyday
Oh, with the touch of your hand I feel it
Oh, now I understand
When I'm feeling down and out of my place
With you and me in a human race
You remind me why I love your face
Over and over
And when the pieces fall you put'em all back
Flying off the rails and put me on track
And that is why I keep coming back
Over and over again
Whenever you're with me
The feeling is carefree
In A in chemistry you and I
You shake me like thunder
It's always a wonder
The things we discover they're so fine
Oh with the touch of your hand I feel
And now I understand
When I'm feeling down and down in my place with you and me in the human race
You remind me why I love your face over and over again
When the pieces fall and you put them all back
Flying off the rails as you put me on track
And that is why I keep coming back over and over again
And discoveries in our hearts
Oh, refresh my lonely heart
When I'm feeling down and out in my place with you and me and the human race
You remind me why I love your face
Over and over again
And the pieces fall and you put them all back
Flying off the rails you put me on track
And that is why I keep coming back
Over and over again
When I'm feeling down
You and me (you remind me why) remind me why over and over again (when the pieces fall) when the pieces fall (flyin' off the rails) flyin' off the rails (flyin' off the rails) I keep comin' back over and over again
