Oh, sing my children
All your troubles gonna flow away
Yes, I know that this river's wide
But if love is on your side
It's a Sunday sun, the sun may must shine
Ain't no need to be in a cry
Keep on moving, always a groovin'
Dance to this music all night long
It can't be wrong, no no not no
If the rain fall and the thunder rolls
And the lightning strike me down
I want you to know my love will never leave
'Cause my love is all around
It's a Sunday sun, sunbeam a shining
Ain't no need to be in a crying
Keep a moving, always a grooving
Dance to this music, oh
It's a Sunday sun, sunbeam a shining
Ain't no need to be in a crying
Keep a moving, always a grooving
Dance to this music all night long
And it can't be wrong
No, no, no, no
It's a Sunday sun
Sunbeam a shine
Ain't no need to be in a cry
Keep a moving
Always a groove
Dance to this music
All night
Sunday sun
Sunbeam a shine
Ain't no need to be in a cry
Keep a moving
Always a groove
Dance to this music
All night
Sunday sun
Sunbeam a shine
Ain't no need to be in a cry
Keep a moving, always a grooving
Dance to this music all night
Sunday sun, sunbeam a shine
Ain't no need to be in a crying
Keep a moving, always a grooving
Dance to this music all night long
And it can't be wrong
No no not no
