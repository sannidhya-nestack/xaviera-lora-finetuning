Are we really through, yeah
What else are we to do, yeah
A love affair
Up in the air, yeah, mmm
You've got a soulful feeling
Mixed with those holiday blues
You checked out long ago
With your love he's been stealing
Are we really through yeah
What else are we to do yeah
A love affair up in the air yeah
We've both been feeling it
And more than just a little bit
An icy cold chill in the air
Our love way beyond repair
It used to be a love affair
But turning quickly into solitaire
Remember once walking on air
So much for tender love and care
Are we really through yeah
What else are we to do, yeah
A love affair
Up in the air, yeah
Oh yeah
Are we really through, yeah
What else are we to do, yeah
A love affair up in the air, yeah
I've got a soulful feeling
In need of some healing
Of relationship and disrepair
Life can be so unfair
It used to be a love affair
But turning quickly to solitaire
Remember once walking on air
Are we really through yeah
What else are we to do yeah
A love affair up in the air yeah
Are we really through
What else are we to do yeah
A love affair
Up in the air
Oh yeah yeah
Are we really through yeah
What else are we to do yeah
A love affair
