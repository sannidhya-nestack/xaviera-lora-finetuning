Well there was a time I was giving permission
But you would come and go, not for sale
You were that easy prey, easy submission
But now I'm mad as hell, chasing my tail
And it's on, it's on, and it's on
And I tell me, spend your time with someone else
And it's on, and it's on, and it's on
And I tell me, spend your time with someone else
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And every now and then I look at your picture
And every now and then I give you a try
But that easy prayer, easy submission
Has got me mad itself
Both know why
And it's all (and it's all)
And I tell me
Spend your time with someone else
Said it's all (and it's all)
And I tell me
Spend your time with someone else
But that easy prayer, easy submission
Has got me mad as hell, this is goodbye
And it's on, and it's on, and that tells me
Spend your time with someone
Kiss to the tongue (and it's on)
And now tell me, squeeze your tongue (and it's on)
Kiss to the tongue (and it's on)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
To the tongue (and it's on)
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sit it down, sit it down, yeah, yeah, yeah, sit it down
