Lost too many sunny Sundays, searching for the sun
Now I'm running out of days, best make the most of every one
Oh take me back, all those years ago when
My eyes were open wide, I had a chance to change
How'bout no
Here's a familiar place, and they say you learn
They say you learn from your mistakes, but no
I'll choose a familiar place to go
Get up and go again, full circle through the pain
Had to go there to say no, I'm never gonna go there again
When you reach out for a hand, you better trust it is safe and secure
I won't give up the fight, I'm like a mob to the light
In a familiar place, and they say you learn
They say you learn from your mistakes
But no, I choose a familiar place to go
Oh, take me back all those years ago
When my eyes were open wide I had a chance to change
But no, here's a familiar place
And they say you learn
They say you learn from your mistakes
But no, I'll choose a familiar place to go
I won't give up the fight
I'm like a moth to the light
