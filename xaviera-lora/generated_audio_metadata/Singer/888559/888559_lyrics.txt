Backing down from battlegrounds of dissonance
Turned around experiments in life and love and hate
Rarely been through, but always took the bait
Reeled in, bore a prize upon the wall
Hear the sound of baying hounds of visionaries
Tearing down the rudiments of everybody's fate
Like a fender on a broken car, knocked around
Driven too far to stand alone for another day
They always ask but I never know
Always ask but I never know
Always ask, I never know what to say
So I'm backing down
Falling down a broken path, the bells they ring
Trumpets sound to herald him, the nothing king
Walls they crumble like broken souls
Vines are choking the kings of old
Ground is cracked, the taste of water
Falling as the light of day
They always ask but I never know
Always ask but I never know
Always ask, I never know
What to say
So I'm backing down
Backing down
Don't look to me for answers now
A wounded sage can't tell you how
With wisdom false and battle cries
That lead you to no greater heights
Lean hard into the warmth of life, spend your time on love
Lean hard into the warmth of life, spend no time on love
Spend your time on love
Backing down from battlegrounds of dissonance
Turned around, experiment in life, love and hate
Rarely been through but always took the bait
Reeled in for a prize upon the wall
They always ask but I never know
Always ask but I never know
Always ask I never know what to say
So I'm backing down
Leaning hard into the warmth of life
Spend your time on love
Leaning hard into the warmth of life
Spend no time on love
Spend your time on love
