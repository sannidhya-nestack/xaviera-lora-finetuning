There is no where I can go
Where your love will not follow me
But will I find that peace of mind
Every weary heart longs for
In the darkest of corners
Because you are all I need
Lord, I believe
You are everything you think, everything new
You bring the relief
You set me free
On this broken road to make everything new
So is there peace?
Is there hope?
Where is love?
On this broken road
Where my bridges are burning
And my heart is turning cold
Please don't let me go
Don't you let me go
Because you are all I need
Lord I believe
You are everything, you make everything new
You bring my relief, you set me free
On this broken road you make everything new
They say the grass is greener on the other side
Yeah
You say if I water where I'm standing
Then I will be alright
Because you are all I need
Lord I believe
You are everything, you make everything new
You bring me relief, you set me free
On this broken road you make everything new
On this broken road you make everything new
