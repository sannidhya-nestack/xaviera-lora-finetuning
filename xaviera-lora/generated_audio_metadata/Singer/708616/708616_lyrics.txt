It could have been day, it could have been night
It could have been up or down, left or right
It could have been a world spinning down
Tiny little bits of me
Scattering all around
Can't hear a sound
Over and over and over and over and over again
Turning turning turning round it spins
Over and over and over and over an endless drain
Turn and turn and turn in the same refrain, it's all the same
River flows to the sea
Oceans rising up to cover me
Sun falls with a burning glow
So far away it lasts and nowhere to go
Now all I know
Over and over and over and over and over again
Turnin' turnin' turnin' round the fence
Over and over and over and endless train
Turnin' turnin' turnin' same refrain
Another night
Under heaven with smile
In a lonely night
In a lonely night
Yeah
Wait for the sun to light the sky
Yesterday's gone, another day gone by
Live my life
Never mind
Go again baby (over and over and over and over and over again)
Turn and then turn and then turn and then turn it around and it spins (it coulda been a world)
Over and over and over and over and over again
Turn into the tuning rod spins
