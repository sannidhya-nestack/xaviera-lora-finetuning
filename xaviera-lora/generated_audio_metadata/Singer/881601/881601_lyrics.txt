Sweet little baby nothing open like the sun
Nothing to be afraid of
Nowhere to run till that lightning comes down
Splits that okay too
Now you guard your heart right
You're forever blue
Been pretending for so long
Tied to know what's true
So much indecision
Try to start anew
But you're locked in a lie
Was told so long ago
And those self-destructive tendencies like fireworks show
Wild river, I can't stop you now
Raging water, running through my town
I tried fighting, you knocked me down
Wild river, carry me now
Let go of that anger, easier said than done
Tight grip of an octopus in the dark ocean
And you're paved with good intentions
Sometimes you get some
Oh leave your baggage at the station love
Come to the water's edge my son
Wild River
I can't stop you now
Raging water
Running through my town
I try to fight it
You knock me down
Wild river
Carry me out
Wild river
Carry me now
Wild river
Carry me now
Wild river
Carry me now
