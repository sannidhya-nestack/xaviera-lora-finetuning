Well I best be on my way
It's about time to go
This old town is full of lies
But where I'm bound I don't know
Drop my friends off back at home
On this cold winter night
I'll be well on my way
By the first morning light
I can see clear to dawn
It's about five hours time
Spent the last few hours driving
Hoping my melody finds a rhyme
Or a reason to keep me on the road
As things are getting out of sight
And I'll be well on my way
By the first morning light
This has all been done before
Seems by someone I know well
I've been awake for about three days
And I'm beginning to feel like hell
Although I don't feel too good
Something inside me feels alright
I'm well on my way
And I see the first morning light
