I'm so happy today
I think I'll disappear away, away
All my troubles are on the move
I'm feeling in the groove and I'm alright
I ain't got my baby on my arm
But I got my lucky charms and I feel alright
When I'm riding on a dream
Clouds just doing their own thing
And it don't matter if the phone rings
I'm just a happy ding-a-ling
And I'm so happy today
I think I'll sing a play
All day, all day
The sun may shine, it may rain
I'm feeling no pain, skipping down the lane
Flip flop and fly
I'm just hanging in the sky
Eating rainbow pie
When I'm riding on a dream
Clouds are just doing their own thing
And it don't matter if the phone rings
Just a happy day of laying
Oh
Yes I am, yeah I am
