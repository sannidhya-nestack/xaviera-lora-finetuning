Cold day, mid-January
High on hope and down on your knee
For me
A long road, this was just the start
We didn't think it would be this hard
But here we are
When you commit for life you leave deeper scars
When two people in love hide with no regard
Once so close now we take it too far
Another night, another shot, we fight, we fight
Like we're on different sides, no winners or losers
So why are we keeping score?
Can we be civil or is this war?
You say my name like a curse
We're two fools trying to make this work
And it hurts
It's been a while since we've seen eye to eye
We see being right as a point of pride
Our words have caused this great divide
No longer unified
Another night, another shot we fight
We fight, like we're on different sides
No winners or losers, so why are we keeping score?
Too many days that we ignore each other
Afraid that we won't recover
I hurt you, you hurt me, I wonder what it's all for
Can we be civil or is this war?
Can't we just cease fire?
And go back to that winter night when everything was right
Cold day, mid-January
Another night, another shot we fire
We fight like we're on different sides
No winners or losers, so why are we keeping score?
Too many days that we ignore each other
Afraid that we won't recover
I hurt you, you hurt me
I wonder what it's all for
Can we be civil or is this war?
