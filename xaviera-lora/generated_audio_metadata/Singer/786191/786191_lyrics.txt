If I was to know that you were coming home
I'd rush around to make sure that it was your home
I wouldn't make the bed and wouldn't wash the sheets
you smell my love, a man it has brought to his knees
What's it all about?
Two bodies in the whirlwind
I do believe that you can see the look in my eyes
If I was to know that I would still be on my own
I'd move to the country and start again by myself
Maybe I'd raise a family and settle down
I'd be happy for a little while and I'd miss you my love
I'd miss you my love
What's it all about? Two bodies in a whirlwind
But do you believe that you can see the look in my eyes?
And what's it all about? Two bodies in a whirlwind
