When this old world we're living on
Journeys around the sun
Part of us is left behind
Part has just begun
No one day we ever live determines who we'll be
Yesterday I barely knew you
Tomorrow you may not know me
Turn around and we were strangers
Turn around and we were friends
Turn around and now we're lovers
Turning around again
The youthful prey, the time will pass
The old bear get to stay
Moments last a lifetime
Years just slip away
You and I, we'll live and die
And all we'll really leave
Is fading footprints in the sand
Precious memories
Turn around and we were strangers
Turn around and we were friends
Turn around and now we're lovers
Turning around again
I've heard each star in heaven is a heart that's come and gone
And I pray someday we'll be the stars that lovers wish upon
Turn around and there'll be strangers
Turn around and there'll be friends
Turn around and there'll be lovers
Turning around again
Turning around again
