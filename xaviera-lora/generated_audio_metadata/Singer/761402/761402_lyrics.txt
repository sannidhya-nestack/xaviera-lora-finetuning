You're always looking for something
You're always looking for something, yeah
You're always looking for something
Do do do do do do
You're always finding nothing
You're always finding nothing
You're always finding nothing
Do do do do do do
And I see you on the floor, with the roses in your teeth
And I see you in the dark, and you're falling to your knees
And I see you on the road, and you're screaming, "Baby, please"
Do-do-do-do-do-do
You're always telling stories
You're always telling stories
You're always telling stories
Do do do do do do
And I'm sick of giving you all your pocket full of lies
And I'm sick of giving you all your salty alibis
And I'm sick of giving you all the tears that I have cried
Do do do do do do
And I see you on the floor with the roses in your teeth
And I see you in the dark and you're falling to your knees
And I see you all around and you're screaming baby please
You're always looking for something
You're always finding nothing
You're always telling stories
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do do
