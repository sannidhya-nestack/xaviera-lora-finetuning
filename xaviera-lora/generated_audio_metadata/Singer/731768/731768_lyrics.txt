If you wanna go to heaven
You gotta follow the rules
Show love to your neighbor
And try and lay off the moves
Beg for iveness
And turn the other cheek
Wait for redemption
With the rest of the meek
And this all works in your favour
In that heavenly reveal
But I wanna win
And this world too
The path of the wicked
Is littered with gold
And paved with excuses
And perfume I'm told
And from holy fountains
It rains sanguine
That makes you et
All the prayers that you say
And at each intersection
A good man's passing through
And he wants to win
In this world too
I wanna win
For strength I will pray
Give praise to God's glory
From my new Chevrolet
I wanna walk in the Zion
In new wingtip shoes
Yeah I wanna win
In this world too
Jesus Christ became the Savior
But first He had to lose
But I wanna win
In this world I wanna win
In this world I wanna win
In this world
Soon
