I loved you best in the ocean waves
Where you felt the most alive
Before the break you'd let go of me
And that's how I learned to ride
A perfect world in those tender days
Just before it all went bad
A little girl dreams of it this way
Just to look up to her dad
Home fires rage, a heart skips a beat
Glance at your face
Sometimes the safest place
Is somewhere up the street
Somewhere up the street
A booming voice
Did you call for me?
Oh so much I had to learn
A big mistake
Reaching out for you
Pull away my fingers burned
Confusing world
Never free of doubt
So to sense the swelling tide
A growing girl
Learn to shut'em out
In the places best to hide
Hope fires rage, a heart skips a beat
One glance at your face
Sometimes the safest place is somewhere up the street
Somewhere up the street
I love you best in the ocean waves
Where I feel the most alive
My stroke is strong, now I navigate
When the water gets too high
A perfect world in this alchemy
From the fire where you lived
That little girl she found a strategy
And she's fought hard to ive
Oh, fire's rage, a heart that skips a beat
I still see your face
Sometimes a saving grace
Is waiting somewhere home
Fires rage
Our hearts still shall beat
One glance at your face
Sometimes the safest place
Is somewhere up the street
Somewhere up the street
Somewhere up the street
I loved you best in the ocean waves
