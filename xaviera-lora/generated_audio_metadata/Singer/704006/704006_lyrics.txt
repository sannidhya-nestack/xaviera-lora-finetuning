You've got a voice inside you
And nobody knows it like I do
And I like to talk about you
And every word I say is true
Just like the sunrise
Your love comes shining through
You'll be my sunshine
I'll be your midnight moon
You've got a song inside you
And nobody sings it like you do
And I like to walk beside you
And be perfectly in tune
Just like the sunrise
Your love comes shining through
You'll be my sunshine
I'll be your midnight moon
You'll be my sunshine, I'll be your midnight moon
You'll be my sunshine, I'll be your midnight moon
