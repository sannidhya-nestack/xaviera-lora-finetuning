It's an urban jungle and it's tuggin' at my sleeve
It's whisperin', "Hey mister, can't you help me please?"
Callin' out my name
And begging me to look
It grabs me by the heart
Like a southern misty crook
I built a head of steam
As I breathe the whipper wheels
Still I stumble in between
And dust off needless frills
Give this life to me
Hurl it at my soul
Rub my belly for good luck
I'll get to where I know
I'll devil drink this world
Consume all that I can
And chew right to the bone
Of these countless citizens
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
The trouble with tomorrow is etting yesterday
As I guzzle all my sorrow and fashion some delay
Into the misty brook of the countryside I left
To gain such little semblance of sweet sounds that left me deaf
As I struggle to et the misery of my past
And dream I can remember
Good things that never last
Give this life to me
Hurl it at my soul
Rub my belly for good luck
I get to where I know
I'll double drink this world
Consume all that I can
And chew right to the bone
Of these countless citizens, yeah
Sin City scintillates such senseless shoddy shams
Oh, and separates new life from old ones
Grasp within both hands
Give this life to me
Hurl it at my soul
Rub my belly for good luck
I'll get to where I know
I'll double drink this world
Consume all that I can
And chew right to the bone
Oh, I'm gonna chew right to the bone
Of this countless citizens
All these countless city sins, yeah
