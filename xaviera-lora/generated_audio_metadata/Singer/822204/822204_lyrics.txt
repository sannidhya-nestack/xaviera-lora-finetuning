I walk on down to the other side
Where the moon is falling, the sun is shining, I'll be alright
I drift away, oh to your face
The memories linger, I'm missing you dear
I wish you'd stayed
And time, it goes by
As slow as watching the water rise to a boil
Another night, the morning comes
I won't be alright
We live and we, we don't learn but someday we just might
And time, it goes by
I guess there's just no way of ever knowing
So I'll stop trying
I'll walk on out
I'll go outside
The leaves are falling
Things are changing
We'll be alright
The leaves are falling, things are changing
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
