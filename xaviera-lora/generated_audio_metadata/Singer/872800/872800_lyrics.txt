Aviator
Aviator, I saw you fly
Over my house today
A house in the country
Casting a shadow on my backyard
Aviator
Aviator, I saw you fly
Gonna leave this dirty country town
Got a job in the city
Can make lots of money
Oh, I can fly like you
Aviator
Aviator, I saw you fly
Over the rooftops
Over the wind-blown cornfield
Swore that you were way to me
You flew by
Yes, you flew by
Aviator
Aeriate up, high so you fly
Hop in the wild blue yonder
Make my spirits wander
Over the rainbow
Down to the silver clouds
Aviator, aviator
I saw you fly
Over my house today
My house in the country
Casting a shadow on my backyard
Aviator, aviator, aviator
Aviator
Dap, dap, dap, dap, dap
Dap, dap, dap, dup, dup, dup, dup
Dap, dap, hap, dab, dab, dab
Dap, dap
Aviator
Aviator
Aviator
