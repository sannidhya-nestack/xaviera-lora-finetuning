Summer winds whisper soft beside my pillow
Dawn is out dancing and knocking on my window
Some faithful lover brings another day to the same old world
Songbirds are calling, playful invitation
Leave your to-do list, join the revelation
Step out the back door, say a big hello
To the same old world
And for once I see the sky
The trees, the world outside
My little world where I hide inside
Golden horizon, a mystical forewarning
I am awakening to more than the morning
After this moment there will never be
Another same old world
And for once I see the sky, the trees, the world outside
My little world where I hide inside
Golden horizon, mystical forewarning
I am awakening to more than the morning
After this moment there will never be another same old world
There will never be
Another same old world
