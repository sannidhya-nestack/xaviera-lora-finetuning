So many tears shed like pouring rain
And then fear said don't go there again
And then the sun came to show me a brand new face
In a far away place
And I'll keep a lookin'til I find that place (find that place)
I'll keep a lookin' now I've seen that face (I've seen that face)
I'll keep a lookin'til I find that place (until I find that place)
I'll keep a lookin' now I've seen that face (seen that face)
Gotta fly now, sky is blue
Gotta try somehow, beat the winter comin' through
Been a valid love, now everyone else
More brand new
I'll keep looking'til I find that place
I'll keep looking now I've seen that face
I'll keep looking'til I find that place
I'll keep looking now I've seen that face
And I'll keep on looking'til I find that place
I'll keep on looking now I've seen that face
I'll keep looking'til I find that place
I'll keep looking now I've seen that face
Ooh, that face
I'll keep looking'til I find that place
I'll keep looking now I've seen that face
