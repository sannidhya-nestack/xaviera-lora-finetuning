I'd come back if you'd only let me in
I'd be there bearing roses
I'd endeavor to walk upon hands and knee
While you all stare down your noses
I have changed
Like you
Rearranged and new
I'll show you proof
When I come back to you
I'd come back if you'd only change some things
I'd be there without warning
Bring back pennies and steam trains and slate alive
And I'd be there by the morning
You have changed like me
Rearranged
I'll tell the truth when I come back to you
Places to go, love to take or to leave
Big consequences we never conceived
Time on the clock ticking over
So far away is much closer
We might believe
I'd come back if you'd only talk to me
I would answer your questions
Where did I go and why did I let you down?
Funny that you should mention
We have changed, it's true
Edges frayed and unglued
We'll know the truth when I
Come back to you
