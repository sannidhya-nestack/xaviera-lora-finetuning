The leaves are blowing everywhere
You left your sweater on the chair
It's all I have now that you have made your choice
With stinging words and a soft voice
The air is heavy I can't breathe
Am I falling through the trees
When you're gone, I feel the silence
When you're gone, there is an emptiness
When you're gone, there is no answer
I must move on when you're gone
Regretting everything I said
Wish you never left my bed
Dreamt I saw you in the store near where we met
Then you fade into a dark sunset
The air is heavy I can't breathe
Am I falling through the trees?
When you're gone
I feel the silence
When you're gone
There is an emptiness
When you're gone
There is no answer
I must move on
When you're gone
Life has no meaning
When you're gone
Yeah, I lose myself
When you're gone
I know it's over, I must move on when you're gone
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
When you're gone, I feel the silence
When you're gone, there isn't emptiness
When you're gone, I know the answer
Must move on, yeah, yeah, yeah
When you're gone, life has no meaning
When you're gone, yeah, I lose myself
When you're gone, I know it's over
And I must move on when you're gone
