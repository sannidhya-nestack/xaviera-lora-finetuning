There are mountains capped with snow
Where few men dare to go
There are seas with hungry waves
That batter ships with their blows
There are deserts where the sands
Are untouched by human hands
And the water is as scarce
As the life upon its land
And yes, there she has been
Swept along by the wind
She's a girl with the faraway eyes
All the wonder she has seen
Through the magic of her dreams
She's a girl with the faraway eyes
All her friends who wish her well
Think she's in some private hell
And the doctors she has seen agree
That time will only tell
But from the corner of her room
Safe inside a quiet womb
She has seen Egyptian treasures
She's seen the Pharaoh's tomb
And yes, there she has been
Slept along by the wind
She's a girl with the faraway eyes
All the wonder she has seen
Through the magic of her dreams
She's a girl with the faraway eyes
There are things we cannot see
There are ghosts from which we flee
There's a shadow next to madness
That we dare not let run free
We will never know the sign
Of the world in which she hides
Never know her flights of fantasy
Never know the things she's tried
Never know where she's been
Swept along by the wind
She's a girl with the faraway eyes
Never know the things she's seen
Through the magic of her dreams
She's a girl with the faraway eyes
She's a girl with the faraway eyes
She's a girl with the faraway eyes
