You don't know the half of what I've learned, babe
Just assume it's everything you've done
The sin that caused the tears has turned to water
It's washing away the years of what went wrong
When mystery is clear
There's no more ghosts to fear
They say the truth will set you free
And the truth has just been shown to me
I got my bags packed, tired of this scene
I'm gonna take my soul to New Orleans
There's a thousand roads leading to relief
And I'm gonna find that place
I got my bags packed out of the scene
I'm gonna take my soul and give it peace
There's a thousand roads leading to relief
I'm moving on and I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean today
I'm coming clean
Come Sunday you are gonna be the past babe
Come July just a distant memory
But for when all the leaves have started changing
The biggest change of all will be in me
I'm hopeful and I'm proud
I've got to shout it out
All I've learned is good to know
But hey man I have got to go
I got my bags packed, tired of this scene
I'm gonna take my soul to New Orleans
There's a thousand roads leading to relief
And I'm gonna find that place
I got my bags packed, tired of this scene
I'm gonna take my soul and give it peace
There's a thousand roads leading to relief
I'm moving on and I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean today
I'm coming clean
Sometimes you have got to go
Sometimes
I got my bags packed, tired of this scene
I'm gonna take my soul to New Orleans
There's a thousand roads leading to relief
And I'm gonna find that place
I got my bags packed, tired of this scene
I'm gonna take my soul and give it peace
There's a thousand roads leading to relief
I'm moving on and I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean, I'm coming clean
Today, I'm coming clean, I'm coming clean (I'm coming clean)
Today, I'm coming clean (I'm coming clean), today (I'm coming clean)
I'm coming clean, I'm coming clean, today
