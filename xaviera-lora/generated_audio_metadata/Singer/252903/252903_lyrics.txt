Disappointed in my attention to you
Are you doubting my sincerity?
Your inaction I interpret as pure rejection
Are you questioning my loyalty?
I took the step, I crossed the line
I gave you an hour at a time
And I trusted you
Of all the promises you made
You kept your word, you gave me strength
And I trusted you
Conversations seem to be lacking something
Leave me lost in negativity
So misguided
In my expectations of you
Why should you do anything for me?
I took the step, I crossed the line
I gave you an hour at a time
And I trusted you
Of all the promises you made
You kept your word, you gave me strength
And I trusted you
I know my steps are small, I'll take this chance to stand or fall
Holding on, holding on to you
Through all these trials there's one certainty you'll always be
Suffering too
I took the step, I crossed the line
I gave you an hour at a time
And I trusted you
Of all the promises you made
You kept your word, you gave me strength
And I trusted you
All you've promised me
All you've given up for me
So hard to comprehend
So I promise you
I will put my trust in you
Once again
I took the step, I crossed the line
I gave you an hour at a time
And I trusted you
Of all the promises you made
You kept your word, you gave me strength
And I trusted you
I took the step, I trusted you
I gave you an hour at a time
And I trusted you
I trusted you
