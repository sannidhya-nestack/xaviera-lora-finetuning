How do you find the strength to walk away
How do you make it easier to leave it all behind
How do you find the perfect words to say
How do you just let go and ease your mind?
And how do you just pretend that you can fill the emptiness
Or hide a sadness that you can't deny?
And how do you bring yourself to do the hardest thing of all?
How do you say goodbye?
How do you say goodbye?
And how do you just pretend that you can fill the emptiness
Or hide a sadness that you can't deny
And how do you bring yourself to do the hardest thing of all
How do you say goodbye
How do you say goodbye
