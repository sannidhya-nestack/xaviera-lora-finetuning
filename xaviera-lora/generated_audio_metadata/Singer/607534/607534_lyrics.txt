He thumbed down from West Virginia
Headed for that country music town
He told her he'd come back to get her
When his first song hit number one
He found a room near Printers Alley
Big enough for him and his old guitar
He took a part time job at Shoney's
Just until his first song hit the charts
He played the clubs and dives down on Broadway
They gave him compliments and beer
And countless times he told his stories
To wounded eyes and broken ears
And he'd sing
I am a songwriter
And this is my story
I am a songwriter
Please listen to me
He carved his poems on paper napkins
He sang love ballads in the rain
He performed for empty chairs and barstools
To cardboard patrons he would sing
He wore the pavement out on music row
With all his heart he pitched his soul
But they couldn't hear the sound he made for them
It didn't fit their cookie mold
So he started drinking in the morning
Said it brought him closer to his souls
And he would show himself some mercy
When his first song hit number one
And he'd sing
I am a songwriter
And this is my story
I am a songwriter
Please listen to me
He woke up late one night screaming
And put a gun up to his head
He closed his eyes and he pulled the trigger
And wrote his epitaph in lead
They sang his songs at the funeral
Like frozen ivy they caught on
The tune they played on the radio
Shot straight up to number one
And he sang
I am a songwriter
And this is my story
I am a songwriter
Please listen to me
He thumbed down from West Virginia
Headed for that country music town
