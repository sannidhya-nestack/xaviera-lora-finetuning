It was a long black night
And I was at the bottom of a deep dark well
This voice kept saying everything would be alright
But from where I sat it was hard to tell
I felt like there was nowhere left for me to go
I felt lost in this world all alone
I asked myself how did I ever get so low
When the voice said to me it's time to come on home
Come on home there's people here who miss your face
Come on home, spend some time in a familiar place
Come on home, there must be someone here you miss
Come on home, we'll drive around and reminisce
I was young and full of hopes and dreams
And this little town I was born in seemed to move so slow
But big city life isn't everything it seems
Sometimes your heart needs a quiet place to go
Now I've never been one for living in the past
I can't sit around the bar and talk about my high school days
But being here again, it's like stepping through the looking glass
And seeing my old friends, it's like I'd never been away
Come on home, there's people here who miss your face
Come on home, spend some time in a familiar place
Come on home, there must be someone here you miss
Come on home, we'll drive around and reminisce
Been away so long, the ones I knew as children had all grown
Settled down and married and had children of their own
Sometimes I wonder what my life would be if I had stayed
Would I have stood there on the sidewalk or run after
The parade
Come on home, those people who miss your face
Come on home, spend some time in a familiar place
Come on home, there must be someone here you miss
Come on home, we'll drive around and reminisce
