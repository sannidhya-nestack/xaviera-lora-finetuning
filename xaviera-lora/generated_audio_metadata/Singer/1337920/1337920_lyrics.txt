I'll batten down the hatches in the pouring rain
My shack is leaking water in this hurricane
I've bought my lucky ticket as I board the plane
And leave this mess behind, it's going down the drain
It makes me feel
How good it all can be
To live in Paris, London or New York
To live in Paris, London or New York
They're spending all their money down in Oxford Street
In Piccadilly Circus in their luxury
He bought the Brooklyn Bridge and raised the asking price
It's like they play Monopoly in real life
It makes me feel
How good it all can be
To live in Paris, London or New York
Deliverance runs in all New York
Where everybody shakes
The money that they make
And down out in the best Manhattan restaurants
They order French Champagne
And by the river Seine
They'll tell you that their lives can never be the same
We're not in Paris, London or New York, no, no
We're not in Paris, London or New York
We're not in Paris, London or New York
