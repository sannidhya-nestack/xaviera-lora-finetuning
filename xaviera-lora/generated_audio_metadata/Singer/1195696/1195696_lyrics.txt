Sunday morning, my train was late
I'm standing at her garden gate
She's watching me, wonder what she sees
Always staring into space
Lost inside the world she knew so long ago
Oh, I don't know
Ghosts ain't dreams and memories like shadows on the wall
I'll be there to catch you when you fall
In this world of upside down, something's found
When I hear her laughing, I can hear her laughing
All seems lost like tears in rain, still love remains and I can't hear her laughing, yeah I can't hear her laughing
I go back to simpler days
Looking through a childhood haze
There's love again, I'm remembering
Black and blue and bruises too
You kissed my wounds and got me through all my fears
All those troubled years
Ghostly dreams and memories like shadows on the wall
I'll be there to catch you when you fall
In this world of upside down, something's found
When I hear her laughing, I can't hear her laughing
All seems lost like tears in rain, still love remains
When I can't hear her laughing, I can't hear her laughing
Maybe one day I can build a bridge to where you are
In this world of upside down, something's found
When I hear her laughing, I can't hear her laughing
All seems lost like tears in rain, still love remains
I can't hear her laughing, yeah I can't hear her laughing
I can hear her laughing, I can hear her laughing
