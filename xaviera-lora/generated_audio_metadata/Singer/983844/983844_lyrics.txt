Two wrongs don't make a right but a third for us just might
And the make up's worth the break up so there's always one more try
So here we are again with everything to lose
One touch from you is all it takes to light the fuse
We're in love and we're in pain when it's all been said and done
We may go down in flames but we'll burn hot as anyone
So here's to the countdown, five, four, three, two, one
Through the ashes and the embers
We never learn to say surrender
When smoke veers and you're not here
I just wanna burn again
And I've got more scars than there are stars up in the sky
And I fall so far left in the dark
But the crash is worth the high
We're in love
And we're in pain when it's all been said and done
We may go down in flames but we'll burn hot as anyone
So here's to the countdown, five, four, three, two, one
So upon a time we had a second chance to make it last
It took us right back to the start so maybe that third time's
We're in love and we're in pain when it's all been said and done
We may go down in flames but we'll burn hot as anyone
We're in love and we're in pain
When it's all been said and done
And we may go down in flames
But we'll burn hot as anyone
So here's to the countdown
Five, four, three, two, one
Yeah, five, four, three, two, one
Two wrongs don't make a right but a third for us just might
