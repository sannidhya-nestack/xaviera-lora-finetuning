I was just thinking'bout you when you walked in
Wearing that silly grin like no one can
It's one I can't et and here's another song for you
It erases all my debts
Here's another song for you, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Let's go out, save the date
Find time to dance again
Good things come to those who take another chance, my friend
When the band begins to play, here's another song for you
Just like a brand new day
Here's another song for you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Alright, you ready? Let's go
Walking down this country road
Under a harvest moon
I was just thinking'bout you when I wrote this tune
Now I'm not sure how it'll sound but doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
When you sing this hand me down here's another song for you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
