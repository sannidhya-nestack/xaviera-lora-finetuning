Two AM, sing just one more song for the road
Then stumble out to the parking lot
Standing empty and cold
And the caffeine can't disguise
That I am weary to the bone
Got to find a way, find a way
Find my way back home
Been driving hard, playing tag
With fortune and fame
But when the lights are gone
The miles drag on
And I get sick of the game
Beneath the engine's drone
I hear you calling sweet Lord
Find your way
Please find your way
Find your way back home
I've been on my own all of my life
It's made me strong
Made me the kind of girl who hates to say she's wrong
But tonight at two a .m. I think I see the truth
This long wolf never walked alone
Every step I take there's you
Spinning out a lifeline
So that I will always know
How to find my way
Find my way
I'll always find my way
I'll find my way back home
