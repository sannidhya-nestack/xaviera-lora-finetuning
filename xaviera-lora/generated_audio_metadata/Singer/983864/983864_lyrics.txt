You're a vision like the day we met
So radiant with the face of an angel
You're not real but you're not a dream
You speak to my heart when I'm unable
Right now my mind is a minefield of trouble
Every day all I see is grief and pain
My beautiful ghost
You teach me heavenly lessons when my spirit needs repair
My beautiful ghost
You punch a hole in the world and push me farther than I'd even dare
To the woman who knows me most
A silent toast, my beautiful ghost
You can heal a healer
You change my life
It tears me apart
That death stole you away
As I look back
Through wiser eyes
Things you showed me
I'm learning a little late
Right now my mind is a minefield of memories
Today's the day you are putting on my ring
My beautiful ghost
You teach me heavenly lessons when my spirit needs repair
My beautiful ghost
You punch a hole in the wall and push me farther than I'd even dare
To the woman who knows me most
A silent toast
My beautiful ghost
My beautiful ghost
