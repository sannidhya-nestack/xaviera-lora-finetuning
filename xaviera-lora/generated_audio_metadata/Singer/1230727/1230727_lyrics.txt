Here's the light at the end of the tunnel
Just another oncoming train
Are we working our way out of trouble?
Or are we diving back into the pain?
Every signpost leads to nowhere
When sunshine turns into rain
There's a turn up ahead but the road never ends
It's driving me insane
Don't you know we've got to
Gotta ride
Beyond the blue
Gotta ride
Beyond the blue
When your world comes crashing down
Pick yourself up off the ground
And ride beyond the blue
It seems like everybody is hurting
It's hard to know just what to believe
Is the answer hiding inside us
In the mirror what do you see
The worst is now behind us
Things are about to change
You gotta do what's right
Stand up and fight
It's time for us to turn the page
Don't you know we've got to
Gotta ride
Beyond the blue
Gonna ride
And ride beyond the blue
When your world comes crashing down
Pick yourself up off the ground
And ride beyond the blue
Fear is nothing but an illusion
All we've got to do is ride, ride, ride
Gotta ride beyond the blue
Gonna ride beyond the blue
When your world comes crashing down
Pick yourself up off the ground and ride beyond the blue
Gotta ride, ride, ride, ride it (gotta ride, ride, ride, ride it)
Ride beyond the blue (ride, ride, ride it, ride it)
Gotta ride, ride, ride, ride it (ride, ride, ride, ride it)
Ride, ride, ride, ride it
The light at the end of the tunnel
Just another oncoming train
Are we working our way out of trouble? Or are we diving?
