Tell me one thing that I've done lately That doesn't come back to haunt me
Tell me one thing that I've done, girl
That doesn't come back to taunt me
If I can do one thing, baby
If I can stand and fight
If I can do one good thing
Make it all alright
You know there were others back then
But you're the one I love
So I'm sorry I can't help you now
But I'm glad you thought I could
See if I can do one thing baby
Well I might be iven
If I do this one good thing
I'd find a way to heaven
Don't know why these things are happening now
Don't know why I'm turning inward
When she left I felt abandoned and afraid and angry
She taught me love is endless
Love is endless
Now at night I hit the streets
The city bars are waiting
And it's so hard to be all alone
But the ties are slowly breaking
See if I can do one thing baby
And hold this thing together
If I do this one good thing
We might last forever
We might last forever
We might last forever
Forever, yeah, yeah
Forever, yeah
Forever, yeah
