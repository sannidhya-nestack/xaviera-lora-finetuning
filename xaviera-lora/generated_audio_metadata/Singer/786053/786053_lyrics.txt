You'll never be what it is I see
I don't feel this anymore
And you'll never know why I let you go
My act of love misunderstood in war
So fly, be free with the best from me
Into this world you'll go all alone
When this love becomes a chore
Leave your heart outside the door
And carry on like we never met at all
The love that we shared
Devolves into despair
A quiet desperation that feels like home
And you see it in my eyes
The truth behind these lies
If it's a life with you, I'd rather be alone
So fly, be free with the best of me
Into this day you'll go all alone
When there's nothing left to score
We'll leave our hearts outside the door
And carry on like we never met at all
I understand those tears
And I understand your words born out of fear
And I'll even understand your hate
But I know that this is right
So go on fly, be free with the best from me
Into each day you'll go on your own
When no one else can be the friend you had in me
You must carry on like we never met at all
Pretending that we never met at all
