Your voice sounds like the rain
Inviting me back again
You're tempting but I cannot give in
Your eyes are as passionate as sin
Because you
Because you are mine
Your mood swings changing like the weather
Our voices raising like hell
If I knew that I was better than this
Do you think I'd still be keeping well?
Because you
Because you
I'm so indifferent
When it comes to you
I keep on falling down these hills
I feel like I have to
Because you
Because you
Because you
Because you
