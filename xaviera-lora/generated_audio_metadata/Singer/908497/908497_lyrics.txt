Locked the door behind these boots this morning
Headed for this city's farthest side
I know she's waiting there with a wooden cross, tires bare
I'm headed for the Lehigh Valley line
They say she runs down somewhere north of Brooklyn
Or maybe all the way to Baton Rouge
I guess it don't matter where I'm going anyhow
As long as I'm going somewhere new
'Cause things will bend before they break
When you're losing in the give and take
I'm sure there's a better way
But I could never learn to stay
Drowning in the darkest side, lonely
Well, I've been black and blue and green and red
Spending more than half my days
Swearing if I leave this place
I could go be someone else instead
The three o'clock should be here any minute
And if not, then the seven forty-five
Just listening for that whistle to come rolling down the rail
Oh, black diamond, come be on time
things will bend before they break when you're losing it
The give and take
I'm sure there's a better way
But I could never learn to stay
So if we should jump the tracks
And know that there's no going back
No not for me
Because tonight I'll be like shining in the sky
I'll see you on the other side
Of the Lehigh Valley line
'Cause things will bend before they break
When you're losing in the give and take
I'm sure there's a better way
But I could never learn to stay
The moon is painting shadows from the sky
And there's no sign, no sign, no sign
