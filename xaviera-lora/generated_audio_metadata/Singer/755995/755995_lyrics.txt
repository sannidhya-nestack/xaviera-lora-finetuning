Don't allow the world to tell you how you should feel
Look inside yourself to find out truly what is real
Accept all that you are, know who's helped you get this far
There is only one thing to do, it's
Discover you,'cause you long to be discovered
Discover you,'cause what's in your heart is beautiful
Discover you, dancing to your pal uncovered
Discover you
Allow yourself to shine the very best that you can
And when you find your voice then go help someone else who can't
Women hand in hand, worthy souls together stand
There is nothing that is more true
So, discover you,'cause you long to be discovered
Discover you,'cause what's in your heart is beautiful
Discover you, dancing to your pal uncovered
Discover you
Free to sing, free to fly, free to live, free to try
Free to give, free to love, free to be me
Discover you'cause you long to be discovered
Discover you'cause what's in your heart is beautiful
Discover you dancing to your power uncovered
Discover you
Free to sing, free to play, free to try, free to soar, free to be, free to feel, free to give up all the pain, free to give up, free to be me
Discover you
