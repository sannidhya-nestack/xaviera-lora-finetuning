Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh
Young boy learns quick how to make things go his way
Learns all about them and the things they say
Becomes a man and his heart turns cold
But that's just the beginning
He grows obsessed with the things he has and hasn't had
And the line blurs between the happy and sad
Takes a pill to change his will and numbers head
Is there anyone winning?
That's life, that's the way it goes
It moves so fast sometimes, I know
Just like the movies filled with highs and lows
Sit back, enjoy the show
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
A young girl dreams and prays for things to get better
She wants to see the world but her mom won't let her
Mom's so afraid she'll lose her innocent heart
But the world is waiting
See this magic age, the world is still full of wonder
And nothing can break the spell that she's under
So she packs her bags and leaves her mom in tears
Worried and waiting
That's life just one big mystery
It burns in you now it burns in me
Just like the old man said before he died
Sit back enjoy the ride
It seems like there's too much to care about (what do you care)
It seems like there's too much to fight about (you don't fight fair)
And just when you think that you got it all figured out
That's when everything changes
That's life, that's the way it goes
It moves so fast sometimes, I know
And just like the movies filled with highs and lows
Sit back, enjoy the show, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
