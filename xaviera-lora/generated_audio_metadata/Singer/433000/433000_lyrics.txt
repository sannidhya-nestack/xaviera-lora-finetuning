If I could bring you days of wonder
Open up your mind
Would it break the spell I'm under
Though we're running out of time
I feel you took away my thunder to burn down
How does it feel to walk on a cloud?
These magic eyes
These magic eyes
Somebody comes with my surprise
Has a look into these magic, magic eyes
If I could bring you nights of loving
Roll between the sheets
Anticipation comes with something
Magic screaming from the streets
I feel you give me less than nothing, nothing
How does it feel to rule the crowd
These magic eyes, these magic eyes
My head is spinning as the last is looking to
These magic, magic eyes
These magic eyes
These magic eyes
I feel them flying so high
When I look into these magic eyes
And in the
These magic eyes
So many colors, my surprise
When I look into these magic, magic eyes
These magic eyes
They're hosting mesmerized
As I look into these magic, magic eyes
What we are looking through
These magic eyes
I feel fire in the soul and I
When I look in
These magic eyes
