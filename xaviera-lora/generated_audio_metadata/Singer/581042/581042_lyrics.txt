And I don't really have much to show
So cross the border on a ninety-four
The road opens up
Leading me straight home to my beautiful wife
And all the good things we have in store
Oh yeah, oh yeah, new yeah, oh yeah, new yeah
And I look up at the night sky (and I) and I can't help but wonder why (and how) how we could live this way (and how) and how we could die (and how) but hope still survives, we know it's alive
I have my pride and though I've denied
I do what I have to do to survive
I play these shows and only God knows
I'm trying my best I suppose
And there's a reason and there's a why
And there's life left in this guy
So we look up and we look out
We look to our friends when we're in doubt
So as I drive I feel alive
Something assures me I'll arrive
And the sky can fall and the stars can fade
But we'll never go away
Oh yeah, oh yeah, do yeah, oh yeah, do yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
And I look up at the night sky
And I can't help but wonder why
How we could live this way
And how we could die
But hope still survives, we know it's alive
Say banana, say bah, say mama, say dada, what does a doggie say, what does a bear say?
