Let's go for a stroll, take time for my hands
Drawing you closer in
The wind in your hair, grass at your feet
I'm falling through hope again, don't you know I
That I'm far from this place
I need to be just to treat you right
I'm walking at base, I'm walking at base
And sometimes I see you just floating away
With a smile in the eyes that I long to see
Stay strong, Elizabeth, for we're almost home
And take a stare, take a stare, take a stare, take a stare,'cause you know
That I'm far from this place
I need to be just to treat you right
But I'm walking in pain
'Cause you know that I'm far from this place
I need to be just to treat you right
But I'm walking a base, walking a base
