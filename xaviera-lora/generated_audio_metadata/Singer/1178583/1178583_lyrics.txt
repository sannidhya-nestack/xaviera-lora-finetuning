I got my share of baggage from who I used to be
And I know we've all made mistakes
But none as bad as me
So here I am trying to put some distance between now
And who I was back then
And I'm not sure if I'm getting better or worse at playing pretend
So I'm starting over
But the secrets I don't tell
And my past is buried as deep as I can dig
I'm still scared as hell and I want to move on
What's done is done and there's no going back
And I'm hoping I ran far enough to stay ahead of my past
Of my past
Things are looking up for me
And I think I might be okay
The farther I get away from it
The easier it is to breathe
I got some chapters in my story
About the old me I'm not sharing
That's my cross to carry
The burden that I'm bearing, and I'm starting over
There's secrets I don't tell
And my past is buried as deep as I can dig
But I'm still scared as hell and I wanna move on
What's done is done, there's no going back
And I'm hoping and I'm praying I'm far enough to stay ahead
Of my past
Stay ahead of my past, mm-hmm
