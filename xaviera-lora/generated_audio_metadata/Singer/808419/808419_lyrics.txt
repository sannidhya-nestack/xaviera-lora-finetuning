Well, it's been so long since I've seen you
But some things have changed, and some remain the same
Do you remember the way it used to be?
Yeah, those were the times
We were so happy
Well, it seems
There's still something I've gotta say to you
But I can't find the words
And I don't even know if it's true
Well
I can still see the child in your eyes
If I could only break through
Take a closer look inside
Could we share precious moments
Those times that we never had
And all the things that's gone by
Maybe they wouldn't seem so bad, yeah
So let me hold you
Before we say goodbye
Cause you know you and me
We're gonna take some time, take some time
So let me hold you now
Before we say goodbye
you know you and me
We're gonna take some time, take some time
