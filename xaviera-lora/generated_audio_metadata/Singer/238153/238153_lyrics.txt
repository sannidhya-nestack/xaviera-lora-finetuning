Endless, time now, time now
Endless, time now, time now
Endless, time now
Take a jet ride and fly like a dove
And see the clouds from way above
it should be endless
Time now, time now, endless
Time now, time now, endless
Endless time now, time now
Endless time now
Dive in the blue sea and swim with the dolphin
They hold the key to where we've been
And keep it as endless
Time now, time now, endless
Time now, time now, endless
Time now, time now, endless
Time now
And walk with your sweetie
et all your nightmares
She holds the key to your future cares
So make it
Endless time now, time now
Endless time now
Endless time now, time now
Endless time now, time now
Endless time now
Endless time now
Endless now
So endless now
Endless now, so endless now
So endless now, so endless now
