Standing still in the margin
Of a dog-eared diary
Patterns appear, then disappear
Transparent are the entries
Where I failed to write the wrong
Vicariously
My pen ran clear
No hero here, no hero here
Wraithing pulp and ink within the passages I sink
As if the page is turning so turn me
Into the oblivion to reconcile the now from the
Discovering the in between is something more than memory
If I could become
What I have learned from
Loving you
According to my journal
Who tallied every time
I needed to love
But only could fear
No hero here
No hero here
A sweet epiphany, something time has given me
So if the world is turning, so turns me
Onto the oblivion, to reconcile the now from then
Discovering the poetry, a black discarded version of me
Who's bound to become someone who's learned from
Loving you
The sad reality
So if you are obliging, pardon me
From out of the oblivion to reconcile and start again
Discovering the mystery of something I could not foresee
That I have become
What I have learned from
That I have become
What I have learned from
That I have become
What I have learned from
That I have become
What I have learned from
That I have become
What I have learned from loving you
