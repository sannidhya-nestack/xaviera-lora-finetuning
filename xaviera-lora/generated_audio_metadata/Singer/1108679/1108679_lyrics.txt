Waking up to a starting gun
I don't play that game no more
Running'til the setting sun
I don't play that game no more
I don't play that game no more
Counting cards and keeping score
Life is what I'm living for
I don't play that game no more
I paid all my debts today
Cause I don't play that game no more
I threw my paper crown away
And I don't play that game no more
I don't play that game no more
Counting cards and keeping score
Love is what I'm living for
I don't play that game no more
Calendar pages keep on turning
Fifty years and I'm still learning
There's a deeper, better yearning
I know someone else's ears are burning, burning
I used to talk like I was certain
I don't play that game no more
I used to act like I'm not hurting
I don't play that game no more
I don't play that game no more
Counting cards and keeping score
Truth is what I'm living for
I don't play that game no more
I don't play that game no more
No I don't play that game no more
