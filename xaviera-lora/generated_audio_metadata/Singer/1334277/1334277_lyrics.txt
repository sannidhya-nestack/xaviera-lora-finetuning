Used to edit every laugh
Softened every word I said
Tried to read the room too fast, played it safe instead
But I got tired of the blur
Hiding all the best of me
So I stepped into the light and now I finally see
Every scar, every sight
Tells the truth I used to hide
I like who I am, no filter, no plan
Dancing like nobody's watching me stand
Don't need a script, don't need a sign
I found the spark and I made it mine
Took a while to understand
But now I like who I am
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
I don't shrink to keep the peace
I smile when it doesn't fit
Got a fire that doesn't freeze and I'm done dimming it
Try to be what they prefer
Till I realize something true
I don't need to be their version
I just need to be my view
Every flaw, every win
Feels like where my life begins
I like who I am
No filter, no plan
Dancing like nobody's watching me stand
Don't need a script, don't need a sign
I found the spark and I made it mine
Took a while to understand
But now I like who I am
This voice, this love, this way I love
They're not too much, they're just enough
I stopped waiting to fit in
Started letting myself win
I like who I am
No filter, no plan
Dancing like nobody's watching me stand
Don't need a script, don't need a sign
I found a spark and I made it mine
Took a while to understand
But now I like who I am
Yeah, yeah, I like who I am, yeah
