Strike me down with lightning, I can barely see
What this crazy world is doing to me
It feels like a joke, a lie, a thief, a crook
And now my insides are turning outside to take a look
So I guess it's time to stop all this blame
Take a look inside, call out my name
Whatever I do I just want to run
Be a little boy, just have my fun
Why are we so afraid?
Why are we so afraid?
'Cause love, what happens when we are brave?
Take a crowbar and crack open my chest
Let the shit run out so I can be my best
Then the sun will begin to shine
I will be yours and you will be mine
Why are we so afraid?
Why are we so afraid?
It's love, what happens when we are brave
And through the dark I see
The shape of me
So I walk to a blind lane
I'm scared to death I believe
Why I wish so afraid
Why I wish so afraid
Cause love
Of what happens when we are brave
We are brave
We are brave
