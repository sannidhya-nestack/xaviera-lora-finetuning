There's a million miles between us
You're a million miles away
And there's a million things on my
There's a million things I don't know how to say
But I won't be happy'til I hold you again
My angel, my lover, my best friend
Because I, I miss you
And like deserts miss the rain
I won't be happy till I hold you again
And I love you
And I need your love so bad
So what's that feeling I ever had
And so I summon the help of my trusty steed (I say I play)
The color I'll put away was because I'm
I'm headed to where my babies at
And I'll be riding right through the night
Be there in the morning and I hope it's alright for you
And had no lovin' since my baby's been gone
Five minutes without that girl
Five minutes way too long
I miss you
And like deserts miss the rain
I won't be happy till I hold you again
And I, I love you
And I need your love so bad
So what's that feel that I ever had?
She's the water in my river
She's the sunshine in my sky
A tree's out in my meadow
She's the cool breeze blowing by
A water in my river, sunshine in my sky
Some trees out in my meadow, she's a cool breeze
Glowing by, by
And I miss you like deserts miss the rain
I won't be happy till I hold you again
And I love you and I need your love so bad
It's the worst damn feeling that I ever had
One feeling I most never had
And I miss you
And like deserts miss the rain
I won't be happy'til I hold you again
And I love you
And I need your love so bad
So what's that feeling I ever had
Ever had
Ever had
