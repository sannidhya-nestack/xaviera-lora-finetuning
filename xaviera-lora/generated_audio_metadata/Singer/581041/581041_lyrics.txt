Do I et or do I follow
Can I holler can I wallow
No I can't they say I can't
And these changes moving faster
Rearrange me from disaster
Can I move on I think I can
I think I can, yeah, I think I can, yeah I can
I think I can, yeah, I think I can, yeah I can
Long ago when I was younger
I had drive and I had hunger
I was wise, it's my demise
But the visions haunted me
So I was littered with the breathing
There was you, then I met you
I think I can, yeah
I think I can, yeah I can
I think I can, yeah
I think I can
Yeah I can
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm trembling and I'm turning
I'll roll it over and I
Feel it closing from all sides
This city got so old so I'm outward bound and I'm
Rolling out with you
We can make it
We can take it
Just me and you babe
Making it through
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
These things ain't so bad
They're relentless but you're glad
So you move on
That's what you do
And the time moves faster
Further from all that disaster
It was you
It was always you
I think I care
I think I can, yeah I can
I think I can, yeah I can
I think I can, yeah I can
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm tumbling and I'm turning, I'll roll it over and I
Feel it closing from all sides
This city got so old so I'm outward bound and I'm
Rolling out with you
We can make it
We can take it
Just me and you babe
Making it through
