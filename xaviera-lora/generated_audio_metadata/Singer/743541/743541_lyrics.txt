Dang it, come on
Doggone it
We've got so much to live for
So let's be optimistic
We've got so much to live for
So let's be optimistic
So many things I can't explain and I don't know
This world is just too big for me
But I'm excited just to know that we can grow
And possibly make history
Now I know how things are happening
Our way may seem so bleak
But we've got so much to live for
So let's be optimistic
We've got so much to live for (oh I know, oh I know)
So let's be optimistic
Oh, the road gets long and tiresome
Hey, but we gonna be alright
Oh, we've got so much to live for, yeah
So let's be optimistic, oh
We've got so much to live for, hey
So let's be optimistic
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We've got so much to live for, yeah, yeah
So let's be optimistic
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We've got so much to live for, yeah
So let's be optimistic
