I remember all this pain inside
Licking the wound after the last fight
All these fears of loneliness
Which turned every color into grey
Whatever happened through
If I'm ever feeling blue
I'm never going back again
All these empty streets without a name
All these puppets on stage, striving for fame
All these empty faces telling me lies
And I got nothing to say, nothing to reply
The nights are getting colder
I feel the rain on my shoulder
I'm never going back again
All these troubles I couldn't avoid
All expectations that I destroyed
All these promises I had to break
And all these compromises for peace sake
I'm the one who must decide
What's wrong and what is right
I'm never going back again
Maybe I'm much too long on my own
Don't realize that I drown
But maybe I'm breaking all this chain
Instead of losing my mind and going insane
Freedom is what I choose
And I got nothing to lose
I'm never going back again
