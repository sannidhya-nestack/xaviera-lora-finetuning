We'd shoot honeysuckle in our fort in the bushes
You taught me how to tie my sneakers at five years old
Hunting treasures in the gutter
We'd hide in the hydrangeas till all of our secrets were told
I broke the windows and you were the good one
When I'd take all the dares you knew just when to hide
When the home fires raged we'd take comfort in each other
Vowing to stay side by side
Remember when summer days lasted forever
Running down hills we could fly
Pumpin' our legs on those creaky old swings
Kickin' a hole in the sky
Saturday afternoons we would sneak into movies
We were blood sisters at Sweet Sixteen
When the boys liked you best I would watch from a distance
But you always came looking for me
We talked about freedom, we talked about the future
We talked from the depths of our young girls' hearts
I was always a dreamer, but you were the smart one
Knowing one day we would part
But remember when summer nights lasted forever
Dreamin' so hard we could die
Swingin' our legs from the hood of a Mustang
Kickin' a hole in the sky
Adventure called you to New York City
The Pacific Ocean called me to stay
And you evolved oh so strong and pretty
Searching out your reasons
Angels and your demons
You lost yourself to a man from the heartland
And he took you to the country to be his bride
He loved you the best that he could, I guess
Was a long cold rocky ride
Now our voices entwine on the telephone line
Remind us to remember just who we are
All the twists and the turns
What we've lost, what we've learned
While we're kicking through to the stars
Now you're raising your head and I'm raising a daughter
Raising our courage to try
If we trust in our hearts, we'll find our feet, my friend
Kicking a hole in the sky
Remember when summer days lasted forever
Running down hills we could fly
Palming our legs on those creaky old swings
Kick in a hole, kick in a hole
Kick in a hole in the sky, kick in a hole
Kicking a hole, kicking a hole in the sky
