You worked so hard to be so perfect
You've got everything but feel so sad
All the things you sacrificed
Was it worth losing all you had?
Looking for something outside of yourself
When you feel like an empty shell
You can be the smartest or wear the most beautiful face on earth
You can be the richest or be more famous for all it's worth
You can be the strongest and be much tougher than any boxer with golden gloves
But when you find it's not enough, be loved
Bits of raging conversation
Friends and family are torn in half
A heartfelt smile and little patience
May lead us all down a better path
Lay down your arms and unclench your fists
You can do more with a kiss
You can be the smartest or wear the most beautiful face on earth
You can be the richest or be more famous for all it's worth
You can be the strongest and be much tougher than any boxer with golden gloves
But when you feel your best is not enough
Be alive
Be loved
You can be the smartest or wear the most beautiful face on earth
You can be the richest or be more famous for all it's worth
You can be the strongest and be much tougher than any boxer with golden gloves
But when you find it's not enough
Be loved
Be loved
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
