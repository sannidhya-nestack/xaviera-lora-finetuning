Take me down to Bluewater Canyon
I wanna spend some time with you
Lay me down at Bluewater Canyon
This is a perfect day to
Walk a while, tell me your secrets
Some things no one has heard before
A longing will waltz on the water
Out where the sunlight meets the shore
And I will sing you a new song
And you'll smile as only you can
We'll spend the whole day long
And I will leave your man
Take me down to Blue Water Canyon
I wanna spend some time with you
Lay me down at Blue Water Canyon
This is a perfect day too
And I will tell you wild stories
And you can dance in bare feet
Hold me closer and closer
So I can feel your heartbeat
Take me down to Blue Water Canyon
I wanna spend some time with you
Lay me down at Blue Water Canyon
This is a perfect day to go
This is a perfect day
Dune
