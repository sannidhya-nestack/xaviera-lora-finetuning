I can feel it now, walls closing in around me
Can't hold me down
I'm so out of place, another day goes by
Seeing all the same faces, it's a deadbeat town
So just get out of my way,'cause I ain't there
Give up on my dreams
They push me pull me
Busting at the seams
Let it go let it go such a heavy load
Leave it all behind me
Gotta go gotta go gotta hit the road
Getting lost to find me
Gonna rock gonna roll
I can see a new horizon
Cause I know what I know can't take no more
Time to hit the road
I can hardly breathe
Got high expectations
I'm drowning in
This mediocrity
If I don't go now
I can see into the future, another year gone by
Just slipped away from me
And I ain't the kind to
Give up on my dreams
Push me pull me
Bursting out I'm free
Let it go let it go such a heavy load
Leave it all behind me
Gotta go gotta go gotta hit the road
Getting lost you find me
Going right
Gonna roll, I can see a new horizon
I know what I know can't take no more
Time to hit the road
Don't know what's ahead of me
Don't know where I'll find
Time to make some history
'Cause I'll never know unless I try
Let it go, let it go, such a heavy load
Leave it all behind me
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta hit the road
Getting lost to find me
Gonna ride, gonna roll
I can see a new horizon
Take the highs, take the lows
The morning sun is rising
I know what I know can't take no more
Time to hit the road
