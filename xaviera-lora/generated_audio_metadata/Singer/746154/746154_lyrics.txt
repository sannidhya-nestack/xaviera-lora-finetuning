Just wanna share this moment and smile
Just wanna et about life for a while
Look into your soul, those beautiful eyes
God knows life can be hard sometimes
Well I'm not talking about forever that don't exist
Just thinking about those times, times that I missed
Well moments like these don't happen all the time
So we should treasure them for all of our lives
I give you my soul babe, just stay here tonight
We know it just feels so right
Well I'm not talking about forever, they don't exist
Just thinking about those times
All the times that I missed
To hold you very long
Well, moments like these don't happen all the time
So we should treasure them for all of our lives
I give you my soul now, just stay here tonight
And it just feels so right
Well, I'm not talking'bout forever
it don't exist, no, no
I'm just thinking'bout those times
it's those times that I miss
Those times that I miss
