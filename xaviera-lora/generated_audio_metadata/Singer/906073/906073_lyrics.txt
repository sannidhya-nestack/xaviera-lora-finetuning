Cigarettes and gasoline
Driving back from Tennessee
The summer sun, it slips away
But we live in a file, it's here to stay
Hey, you look just like all the words I couldn't say
And if I were you I'd wanna get my way
So if you don't like it up on that high
Wow, you can burn with me in the brush fire
Colder weather, autumn skies
The whole damn world is in your eyes
But just because it feels so right
Doesn't mean I can't have fun tonight
Hey, you look just like all the words I couldn't say
And if I were you, I'd wanna get my way
So if you don't like it up on that high wire
You can burn with me in the brush fire
Oh, I'm not a preacher, nor can I say
Burning feels better than slipping away
But I don't know much, but the one thing I do
Is that nothing feels better than burning with you
Oh, I'm not a preacher, no, what can I say?
Burning feels better than slipping away, oh
And I don't know much but the one thing I do
Is that nothing feels better than burning with you
Hey, you look just like all the words I couldn't say
And if I were you, I'd wanna get my way
So if you don't like it up on that high, why?
You can burn with me in the brush fire
Yeah, in the brush fire
Yeah, in the brush fire
Yeah, in the brush fire
