Their sweet words so old fashioned
I don't hear them much anymore
They live in some good old fashioned movie
Now on the cutting room floor
Those obsolete words filled with passion became painfully true
When you put your arm around my shoulder
I fell for you
And I fell big time
I fell hard time
Took me no time
Naturally
I heard my heart pound faster and faster
The closer you came to me
I've seen some good years
I've seen some bad years
Some of my best years went wrong
A moment can shatter a lifetime
Or last a lifetime long
It was a warm day in September
Beach is empty, summer's through
You kissed me once and that was a moment
I fell for you
And I fell big time
I fell hard time
Took me no time
Naturally
I heard my heart pound faster and faster
The closer you came to me
Give me a good old fashioned movie
Where the good guys always win
They all ride into the sunset
Never to be lonesome again
As I sit here
Lost and lonely
Friends say why
Won't you find someone new
There is one
And only one answer
I fail for you
It's crazy but true
What else could I do?
Oh, I fail for you
