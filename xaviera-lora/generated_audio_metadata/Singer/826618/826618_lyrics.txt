A twist and turn
To find a way
To make you see the things
That I have tried to say
I'm gone
I'm gone
I've turned around
It's sometimes hard
It's sometimes sad
Sometimes there are no words
Only thoughts I've had, I'm gone
I'm gone, I've turned around
And I'm so far away
Things look different today
It's funny how it seems
Without you, kinda like a dream
I'll find my way, I always do
I might be lost sometimes, but then again you might be too
I'm gone, I'm gone, I've turned around
And when I leave, I hope you're fine
And you remember me, and think of me sometimes
I'm gone, I'm gone
I've turned around, and not so far
Far away (la la la la la la)
Things look different today (la la la la la la)
It's funny how it seems
Without you
Kinda like a dream
I'll follow my heart
I'll leave my head far behind
I'll follow my heart
Where it leads me I'll spend my time
And I'm so far away (la-la-la-la-la-la-da)
Things look different today (la-la-la-la-la)
It's funny how it seems
Without you, kinda like a dream
Left is right
And up is down
Everything I thought I knew
Seems so different now
Now I'm gone
I'm gone
I've turned around
Now I'm gone
I'm gone
I've turned around
