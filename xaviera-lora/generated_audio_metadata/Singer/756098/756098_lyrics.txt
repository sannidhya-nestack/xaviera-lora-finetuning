Am I the last thing you think of
Before you close your eyes
Is my voice in your memory
To help you through the night
And when your mind starts to worry
Could give you the strength to let go
Try and et the madness
It holds you down, you know
Goodnight my love
I'll see you soon
Goodnight my love
I'll wait for you
When will you ever stop running?
When will you ever slow down?
Don't you know that the answer has already been found?
I know you mean very well now
I know your intentions are good
I'll wait for you forever
And you know I would good night my love
I'll see you soon good night my love
I'll wait for you
May there be grace for your longing
May there be peace in your head
May you know that you're cherished
From every word I've said
Now please rest on your pillow
And please turn down the light
The circus will be there tomorrow
Just let it go tonight
Goodnight
The daylight fades fast, the sorrow burns out
All things pass, except my love for you
Goodnight, goodnight
