Hold me down while I state
Every name I know that beat down my faith
They love to destroy just to create
Building empires out of pure hate
Never try your luck with the vultures you find
I bet my life they'll leave you behind
Hit alone with all your might
Though your eagerness may feel that bite
When in their wake they leave you lost
There's no future for a crooked heart
Never try your luck with the vultures you find
Cause I bet my life they'll leave you behind
Never try your luck with the vultures you find
Oh,'cause I bet my life they'll leave you behind
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Uh-huh
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la
Never try your luck with the vultures you find
I bet my life they'll leave you behind
Never try your luck with the vultures you find
Oh,'cause I bet my life they'll leave you behind
