I'm gonna give this life that I live
To a place may call the dark side
A world of pain where I can remain
Don't wanna climb, just wanna slide
Don't think I'll regret
Least I haven't yet
The people I met
On the dark side
There's danger there
But I don't care
I took the dare
I've taken the ride
Don't wanna stay
Don't watch you this way
Don't want to explain
What's on my mind
I know too well
This living is hell
I'm ready to
I'll see what I find
Won't need no plane
Won't need no train
Ain't got no brain on the dark side
Find my address, care with distress
I'm hurting less on the dark side
It's alright, I'm only having fun
Just checking out these prizes that I won
Think they'll mind if I turn'em into cash
Just might need some before I turn and crash
So wish me well
You never can tell
I'll cast you a spell
From the dark side
An alternate world
Where I've been held
Body and mind
In and outside
So take your first step
If we haven't met
I'll see you yet
I haven't lied
They're making some room
I'll see you there soon
I'll bring you a tune
From the dark side
I'll bring you a tune
From the dark side
I brought you this tune
From the dark side
