I drove to his house at the top of the hill
And my heart was wild but the night was still
And I was just a few minutes late
But he was standing there by the gate
It was getting dark and I couldn't see far
So he grabbed my keys then he parked my car
I thought to myself dear God how could he be so fine
And there's something about him that reminds me of Elvis
And there's something about him that reminds me of Jesus
And there's something about him that reminds me of love
And that's enough
The candles were lit when he took me inside
And I looked through the window at the city lights
Down through the vastness, cars racing fast down the Hollywood 101
But there inside it was peaceful and real
And I felt some things I'd otten to feel
Felt like a stranger, he felt like a friend
I felt alive again
And there's something about him
That reminds me of Elvis
And there's something about him
That reminds me of Jesus
And there's something about him
That reminds me of love
And that's enough
Now I can't play guitar and I can't raise the dead
And it ain't from Grace or Bethlehem
But it gave me some soul and it gave me some life
And it rocked me all through the night
Ooh, I feel alive
Ooh, I feel alive
And there's something about him that reminds me of Elvis
And there's something about him that reminds me of Jesus
And there's something about him that reminds me of love
And that's enough
That's enough
And there's something about him
That reminds me of love
And that's enough
That's enough
