There was sunlight in your hair
I can almost feel you there
Even in my sorrow
Your kiss upon my lips
Please grant me one more wish
Then I promise not to follow
Where the moon meets the sea
Still pretending you're with me
My words, yes I know my words
They all sound so hollow
Just say goodbye
It's over now, just say goodbye
Say goodbye
It's over now just say goodbye
As we pass through one more year
There's nothing for me here
Nothing, no nothing
Not even one more tomorrow
Just say goodbye
It's over now, just say goodbye
Oh say goodbye
It's over now just say goodbye
There is no time to hesitate
ive et is our best fate
Pride the last thing to go
Just say goodbye
Just say goodbye
It's over now
Just say goodbye
Say goodbye
It's over now
Just say goodbye
It's over now just say goodbye
Just say goodbye
