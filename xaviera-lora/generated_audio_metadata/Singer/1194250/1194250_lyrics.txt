Tell me all your childhood dreams
What you always wanna be
What would make your life complete
Show me how you do your hair
I can't help myself but stare
I just wanna hold you near
Tell me the things that you do
All of your memories too
I need a little more you and a lot less me in my life
I wanna know in your heart
Even the ugly parts
I need a little more you and a lot less me in my life
Where's your secret happy place
What's your favorite funny face
How'd your parents pick your name
What's something you've never told
Ain't nobody else before
I just wanna be your world
Tell me the things that you do
And all of your memories too
I need a little more you and a lot less me in my life
I want to know your heart
Even the ugly parts
I need a little more you and a lot less me in my life
Girl until you've run out of words to say
And tell me the things that you do
All of your memories too
I need a little more you and a lot less me in my life
I wanna know your heart
Even the ugly parts
I need a little more you and a lot less me in my life
Show me what love is for
I vow to give you more
I need a little more you and a lot less me in my life
I need a little more you and a lot less me in my life
