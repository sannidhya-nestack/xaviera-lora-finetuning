Sometimes I think of Oklahoma
And though the memories are growing dim
I feel the heat, I taste the dust
And I hear a lonesome prairie wind
As a child I dreamed of leaving almost every day
I was waiting on the ghost of Wiley Post to come fly me away
I read in faded magazines
Of strange and distant lands across the sea
I could hear Morocco, Kashmir and Ecuador
Calling to the restless heart in me
As a child I dreamed of leaving
Almost every day
I was waiting on the ghost of Wiley Post
To come fly me away
So I let out without knowing where I was going
The highway was a dark river flowing
I paid my dues for the Dust Bowl Blues and made my getaway
I let my dreams carry me where they may
I'm far away from Oklahoma
But I won't escape that dusty land I knew
As I grow old, I realize
How the years will make my dream come true
As a child I dreamed of leaving
Almost every day
I was waiting on the ghost of Wiley Post
To come fly me away
I'm waiting on the ghost of Wiley Post
To come fly me away
