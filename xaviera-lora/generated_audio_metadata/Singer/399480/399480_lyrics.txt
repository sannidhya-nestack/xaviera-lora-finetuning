I wish that I was lazy and lived beneath an apple tree
I wish I had ambition to sail across the seven seas
I want to be crazy and live with the gypsy and his castle made of sand
But then I want my sanity and coziness to comfort me
Life is greater on the other side
And what you leave behind may shine
I wish I was a genius
And sacrificed my mind to save the atmosphere
But then I look around me
And wish I had a friend or two to join me here
I want to be the phoenix that rises from the rubble to lead the fight
But then I'd wish for playful children to nurture and keep home at night
Life is greener on the other side
And what you leave behind may shine
Wish for where you are
Wish for where you are
I wish that I knew freedom to roam the endless urban landscape
I wish I had a dollar for every time and fear I dreamed that was my fate
I wanna be president
But then I'd have to tell all of those little lies
And gently bend the truth
Since neither side is perfect
I keep on searching for that sea of grey
Or somewhere in between these sides of
Life is greener on the other side
And what you leave behind may shine
Life is greater on the other side
And what you leave behind may shine
Wishful a life
Wishful a life
