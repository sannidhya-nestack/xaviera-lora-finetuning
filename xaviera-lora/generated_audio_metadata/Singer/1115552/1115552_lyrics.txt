Living through the good and bad
After all the years we've had
Side by side on this train of light
We've said goodbye to some we love
Living down always fit the glove
But as time goes by there isn't much I change
I'm still in love, still in love
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love, still in love
I'm still in love
With you
And even through the ups and downs
We've always had common ground
We're family and that's what really matters
The twists and turns of love and loss
I know it's all had a bitter cost
But I'd come back and live it all again
I'm still in love, still in love, still in love with you
I'm still in love, still in love, still in love with you
'Cause I'm still in love with you (still in love with you)
Still in love with you (still in love with you, still in love with you)
Still in love with you
We've always held us steady'cause through life's stormy rain
A constant star marching on, I can't navigate
And I'm still in love, still in love, I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love, still in love, still in love with you
I'm still in love with you (I'm still in love with you)
I'm still in love with you (I'm still in love with you)
I'm still in love with you (I'm Still in love with you)
Still in love with you
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you
