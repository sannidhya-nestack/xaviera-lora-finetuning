Wanna tell you what I am all about
Spend the night with you, shout the whole world out
Carve a corner of a universe for us
Some Santa few trees would be enough
Wish you would just tell me your name
Wanna hear why you talk to yourself
Curl your eyes and tell me why you make me mad
Hold you close and just listen to the rain
We agree that everyone's insane
Wish I could just skip ahead to that day
And all this time
Blinded by my own disguise
I couldn't see ahead far enough
Yeah those elephants make it tough
So I can say
Today's a brand new day and
I think it won't be that rough
Better than almost good enough
Wanna sit with you underneath the sun
Kiss the air with our words and write a song
We're all here so all we have to do is play
Watch the day just waste itself away
Wish we could just skip ahead to that stage
Wanna hope that everything will be alright
When I tell you about all I got inside
Just a few years might take some time
But every moment you will be on my mind
Wish I could just skip ahead to that day
In all this time
Blinded by my own disguise
I couldn't see ahead far enough
Yeah I was just making it up
So I can say today's a brand new day and
I think it won't be that rough
Better than almost good enough
So I can say today's a brand new day and
I think it won't be that rough
Better than almost good enough
