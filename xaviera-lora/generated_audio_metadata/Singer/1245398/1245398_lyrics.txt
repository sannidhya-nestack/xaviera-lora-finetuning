If you can believe
If you could just see
Love is everything
Love is waiting
In time we will know
All we must know
So we can find our way home
I want to find my way home
There is a sparkle of hope
Even in moments unknown
Why should love wait alone
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I want to find my way home
I'm going home
With the light of the sun
A new day will come
Because we are not done
No we are not done
In time we will know
All we must know
So we can find our way home
I want to find my way home
There is a sparkle of hope
Even in moments unknown
Why should love wait alone
I wanna go home
I wanna go home, I wanna go home
I want to find my way home, I'm going home
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
There is a sparkle of hope
Even in moments unknown
Why should love wait alone
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I want to find my way
I'm going home
