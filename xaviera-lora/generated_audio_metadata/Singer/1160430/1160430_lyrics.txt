Sunbeam shining on my shoulders
Wintertime bringing change
Spent lots of time wishing I was older
Now that it's here I don't feel the same
Wishing I could turn back, turn back the hands of time, yeah
'Cause I'd be more present, present in my life
Could have, would have, should have
Could have, would have, should have, baby
Could have, would have, should have
I'd be more present in my life
I'd be more present, present in my life
Could have, would have, should have
Sunlight, moonlight, then the day starts over
Then another whole trip around the sun
Sometimes I wish I could just start over
Skip all that and linger in the fun
Could have, would have, should have
Could have, would have, should have, baby
Could have, would have, should have
Could have, would have, should have, baby
I've learned a lot, I've learned a lot, I've learned a lot about living
I'd be more present, present, oh
