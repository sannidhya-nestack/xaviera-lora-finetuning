Inhaling paranoia
It's in the news most everyday
Searching for some kind of something
To take all of this pain away
While the men who means get meaner
I never know quite what to say
It feels like a big change coming
Another bill for us to pay
Twisted into something sinister
Pretty words that bother me
Old doors deadlocked and bolted in towers made of ivory
They'll have you bite the hand that freed you
Chasing ghosts through love and war
Take us back to good old days when we died young
And we died poor
And one man's logic is another's lunacy
No one will come down and save us
So we will save ourselves
No one will come down and save us
So we will save ourselves
With a long shot, lean on to the target, it's all that we have got
And we're standing before a golden lion, with a sling full of sharp
Greeted like some long lost brooder
Then poked instead with fear and hate
Welcomed in like the guest of honour
And end upon their dinner plate
Simple answers to complex questions
Never will sit right with me
A picture never tells a story
Margo's arm and we can see all your words don't sit right
Just ahead from the dark, the dark that we bring
No one will come down and save us
So we will save ourselves
No one will come down and save us
So we must save ourselves
But with a long shot
Leading to the target's all that we have got
And we're standing before Goliath
With a sling full of sharp
