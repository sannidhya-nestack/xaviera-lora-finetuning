Take your memories, write'em down
Take your photographs, leave them out
Just the two of us in this old house
You're the only thing I wanna hear about
Well this firewood burns out slowly
And your coffee still is burning
You can tell me all your stories
One page at a time
Read me the chapters of your life
One page at a time
Read me the chapters of your life
All your better days and all your worse
Tell me all of them, I want to feel your hurt
Some pages make me laugh, some make me cry
But the woman next to me, she makes me smile
Well, this firewood burns out slowly
And your coffee still is burning
You can tell me all your stories
One page at a time
Read me the chapters of your life
One page at a time
Read me the chapters of your life
I wanna be the guy
In the chapters of your life
