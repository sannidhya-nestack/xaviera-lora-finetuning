Forty years, still don't know myself
Still looking out the window
Wanted you to see someone else
Looking out the window
Show me how to live
Show me how to live
Show me how to live
Show me how to live
Been trying to let you go
But you're too close
Been trying to be honest with myself
But I'm too close
Show me how to live
Show me how to live
And I'm waking up cold and lonely
Staring in the dark
How did I get here this far?
Show me how to live
Show me how to live
Show me how to live
Show me how to live
