I didn't know that she was leaving
I didn't know'til she was gone
I didn't know that I'd be grieving
How could I have been so wrong
They say easy come and easy go
Like love must be a dollar bill
Well, I don't buy their talk for show
Never have, never will
I guess she never got my letter
My text, my email, or my calls
She's acting like I never met her
Like a mom to a lot of old ones
These iron chains are cold and rusted
The flambo's flame is almost out
I don't know why I was so trusting
It's all over but the shout
I'm hanging on to one last shadow
But I know there's no relief
I'm no Count of Monte Cristo
This is no
Chateau deep, no one is listening
No one hears as my last lonesome mourn falls
Upon the cold and stone deaf ears
Of these Montalado walls
