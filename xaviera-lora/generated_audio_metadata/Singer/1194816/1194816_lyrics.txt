New conversation, good expectations
Date reservations, I had sensations for you
Then your number went mute, damn
No explanation, left as a dating
Getting impatient, hope your intentions were true
Really thought you were cute
I set the bar, real, real, real light
Still spending Friday night at all
I don't know what went wrong, went wrong
I don't know what more I could do
Keep my heart in limbo
Waiting for you (waiting, waiting, waiting)
I don't know if you'll come (you'll come)
I don't know if I want you to (to, to, to)
My heart's in limbo (limbo)
Waiting for you (waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting for you)
I feel like a loser
Swiping through users
Tinder abuser
I called an Uber for you
When you call from the blue
Two hours later, stuck with the waiter
Love is a labour, I'm sick of playing the fool
Am I easy to use, oh
I set the bar real, real, real low
So spend a Friday night alone
I don't know what went wrong
I don't know what more I could do
My heart's in limbo
Waiting for you
I don't know if you'll come
I don't know if I want you to
My heart's in limbo (limbo)
Waiting for you (waiting for you, waiting for you)
Tell me where the good ones hide
Tired of girls wasting my time (don't waste my time)
Mama says just keep on trying (oh yeah)
Searching for the one I'll treat you right
I don't know what we want
I don't know what more I could do
My heart's in limbo
Waiting for you
I don't know if you'll come
I don't know if I want you to
My heart's in limbo
Waiting for you
My heart's in limbo, limbo, waiting for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting for you
