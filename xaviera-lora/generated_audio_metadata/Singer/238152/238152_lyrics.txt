Just another day, here by myself
Was once a day, I figured you'd always stay
Now it's just another day, as the world fights itself
And I still feel the spot where you once lay
Now it's just another day, here by myself
I remember days of sun, only filled with fun
And nights and days turned into a year, forever together, said our peers
But in time things started to change, our feelings of love, no longer exchanged
Oh, just another day, just another day
Just another day, as the world fights itself
I still feel the spot where you once laid
Just another day, here by myself
And I still remember that day when you said you couldn't stay
And as she packed and she got on that bus sadness settled over us
And I thought maybe I should cry but I didn't know how to begin to try
And I survive through the night
As the darkness closes in tight
The beads of sweat pour over me
The loss I feel brings me to my knees
The mistakes made I do now know
And the tears begin to flow
Mm-hmm, just another day
Here by myself
Was once a day
Figured you'd always stay
Now just another day
As the world fights itself
I still feel the spark where you once lay
I remember just days of sun
Seemingly only filled with fun
The nights and days turned into a year
Forever together set our peers
But in time things started to change
Hot feelings of love no longer exchanged
It's just another day
It's just another day
Here by myself
Oh, just another day
All by myself
Just another day
