I can see it in your eyes
Sun on the grass and waves
Sun on the grass in west
I can see it in your eyes
Sun on the grass in west
There's a child looking at me
There's a child looking at me
There's a child looking at me
Where are you? Where are you?
I can see it in your eyes
Shot on the grass in vain
There's a child looking at me
Grassy banks, I can see it in your eyes
Sun on the grassy banks
Sun on the grassy banks
I can see it in your eyes
Sun on the grassy banks
