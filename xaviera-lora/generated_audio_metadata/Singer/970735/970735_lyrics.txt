Sugar starts with kisses on his neck
Rising to the whisper in his ear
Loving all the promises she makes
To honey, honey
Builds a home facing the west, golden
Suns are setting through the years, dripping
With the love he'll give and take, to sugar
So many sweet things will come and go
Tough times made easier
When two hearts overflow with honey
And sugar
Honey
Holds the key that opens doors
Sugar
Shines a light in every room
Funny
Honey doesn't taste a bit like sugar
So many sweet things will come and go
Tough times made easier
When two hearts overflow with honey
And sugar
