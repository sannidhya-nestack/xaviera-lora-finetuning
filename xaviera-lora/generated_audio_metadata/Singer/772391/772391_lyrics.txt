This is my solitary prayer
To see you standing there
After all we did, after all we said, all we said
This image of you fills my head
Asleep in this perfect dream
It's here that I can picture
Picture the scene
Charged with emotion we kiss, reminisce
In seas of our ocean we are blind, blind in the moment
With eyes for no other we sigh, realize
No way to control it we are free
Flying free
Flying free
With these wings we can fly where no others see
With these wings we will find some sanctuary
Flying free
Flying free
We climb down from our ivory tower
A cast of two in our finest hour
To wine and dine like movie stars, movie stars
Talk it through to heal the scars
There are souls where we can pair
These exit wounds that we have shared
Charged with emotion we kiss, reminisce
In seas of our ocean we are blind, blind in the moment
With eyes for no other we sigh, realize
No way to control it, we are free
Flying free, flying free
With these wings we can fly where no others see
With these wings we will find some sanctuary
Flying free
Flying free
