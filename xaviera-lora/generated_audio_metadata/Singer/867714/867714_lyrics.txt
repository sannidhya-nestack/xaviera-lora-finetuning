Did you know you can't pledge allegiance to the flag
But you can protest, the boys will defend her
Who the hell's teaching our children what happened to
Yes ma'am and thank you sir
Family values got lost in time
My mama cooked dinner for us every night
I know you think you're bringing your kids up fine
Give me a one way flight
Back to the 50's
Back to the fifties
Can you remember when? Way back then
Divorce is a common thing these days
I guess it's no big deal
Do you ever think of what your children say?
Do you really care about just how they feel?
Another mother lost her son
No such thing as a fair street fight
He got in trouble and her boy had a gun
Give me a one way flight
Back to the fifties (back to the fifties)
Where the women were women, the men were men
(Back to the fifties)
Well the dollar was king no one heard of the yen
Back to the 50's (back to the 50's)
Back to the 50's (back to the 50's)
Can you remember when? Way back then
Yeah way back then
The fifth days were the glory days
Baseball, apple pie, Chevrolet
Qualitative was the American way
Made right here in the US of A
Growing up feeling safe and secure
You could trick or treat or walk out to the door semi-star
Never burn the flag or let it touch the floor
Can you remember
We're outsourcing all the employment
I can't read the writing on this toy
Cheap labor's flooding our borders
You know when I was younger I was a buzz boy
You rape a child they slap your hand
Don't leave your door unlocked at night
What does it mean to be American?
Give me a one way flight all the way (back to the 50's)
Well the women wore women the men wore men
Back to the 50's
Well the dollar was king no one heard of the yen
Back to the 50's
Back to the 50's
Back to the 50's
And you remember when way back
Back to the fifties, yeah, way back then, yeah, way back then
Back to the fifties, yeah, you're in America now my friend
Back to the fifties, English is the language, it's not pretend
Back to the fifties
Political correctness, where does it end?
Back to the 50's
Women were women, men were men
Back to the 50's
Welcome to America my friend
I'm going back, going back, yeah, back to the 50's
Going back, going back, yeah, back to the 60's
Women were women and men were men, back to the 50's
Back to the 50's, I'm going back, I'm going back, I'm going back
I'm going back, back to the 50's (back to the 50's)
I can't see you tonight, love, I gotta catch a flight
I know you wanna see me tonight, you know I gotta catch a flight
All the way, back to the 50's, can you remember when?
