There will be peace little sister
When life is looking like the bad guys gonna win
There will be love in your future
If you can let a little light shine its way in
Your road may veer off in a hundred misdirections
But the way will always find you
In the end, and the clouds may cover every inch of all the sunshine
But the truth will enter in and set you free
And set you free
And set you free
There will be hope, little brother
When things are feeling like the tide is rolling in
There will be good in your lifetime
If you can see a little sweetness in the end, oh
Your road may veer off in a hundred misdirections
But the way will always find you in the end
And the clouds may cover every inch of all the sunshine
But the truth will enter in
And set you free and set you free
And set you free
So when the clock is running out
And you feel there's nothing left
Don't you give up on me
Don't you give up on me friend
my road may veer off in a hundred misdirections
But the way will always find me
In the end
And the clouds may cover
Every inch of all the sunshine
But the truth will enter in
And set me free
And set us free
And set us free
And set us free, and set us free
