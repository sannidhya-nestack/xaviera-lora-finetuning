His toys on the floor, his heart on his sleeve
He's calling to daddy, oh please do not leave
But daddy's signed up and now he must go
To far away lands he'll soon come to know
American Wars, the profit machine
Destroyer of life, conscience uncreened
His dad'll be killed but that's okay
The war machine must have its own way
The coffin all draped with stars and stripes
His young child is crying, how can this be right?
American dreams all drenched in blood
Mountains of cash, a Washington's flood
American wars, the private machine
Destroyer of life, conscience unclean
His dad'll be killed, but that's okay
The war machine must have its own way
Yeah yeah
Eisenhower gave us his warning
MIC power
Populous yawning
American wars
The profit machine
Destroyer of life
Conscience unclean
His dad'll be killed
But that's okay
The war machine must have its own way
Must have its own way
Must have its own way
