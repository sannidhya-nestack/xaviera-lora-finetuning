We could solve every problem in this world
Wouldn't be so tough
If we woke up and finally realized
All you need is love
All kinds of love
Love's a box of crayons
A rainbow even in the rain
Snowflakes through a prison
No two are ever the same
When you open up your heart and mind
Can't help but discover
Hate only comes in black and white
But love comes in a million colors
Why don't you be you and I'll just be me
We can still get along
Why can't we all agree to disagree?
different isn't wrong
No, it ain't wrong
Love's a box of crayons
A rainbow even in the rain
Snowflakes through a prism
No two are ever the same
When you open up your heart and mind
Can't help but discover
Hate only comes in black and white
But love comes in a million colors
Such a simple golden rule
Letting kindness show
Take a breath and just let
All your judgments go
Love is a box of crayons
A rainbow even in the rain
Snowflakes through a prison
No two are ever the same
When you open up your heart and your mind
Can't help but discover
Hate only comes in black and white
But love comes in a million colors
Yeah love comes in a million
Million colors
