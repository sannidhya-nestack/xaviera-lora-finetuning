You can tell me that you're sorry now
But the blame is mine
You can tell me that I cheat myself
With my suspicious mind
But you hide the truth like you hide your eyes
When you talk to me
When deception hurts
I'm sorry when you say those words
So don't tell me that you love me
When you know it's just a lie
Don't tell me that you'll stay
That's just another goodbye
Girl I really don't mind but don't tell me that you love me, oh baby I ain't so blind
If you feel so trapped, I could let you out or you could stay in line
You let good things die, what's so sad you'll get left behind
So don't tell me lies
And don't patronize
I can't stand it
If you betray all the good I have
All the good will die
So don't tell me that you love me
When you know it's just a lie
Don't tell me that you'll stay
That's just another goodbye
You can keep pretending
Girl I really don't mind
But don't tell me that you love me
Baby I ain't so blind
You know baby I ain't so blind
I am, I am, I am, I am, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,
