I hope that you can
I hope that you can come back home
I'll leave the light on
I'll leave the light on
I hope that you do
I hope that you do miss me too
Like I miss you
Like I miss you baby
This hotel holds a vacancy
Swole heart on hold, waits patiently
Sweetheart, come back, remember
Always be my girl
I hope that you don't
I hope that you don't want to stay
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone, baby?
This hotel holds a vacancy
Swole heart on hold, waits patiently
Sweetheart come back, remember that
You'll always be my girl
This hotel holds a vacancy
Swole heart on hold, waits patiently
Sweetheart, come back
Remember that
You'll always be my girl
I hope that you care
Hope that you can come back home
