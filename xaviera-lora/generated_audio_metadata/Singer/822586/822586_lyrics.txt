My walk was aimless, my road a rocky path
I tripped on memories that tore my soul in half
Turned joy to sorrow, made enemies of friends
Now nothing's left of me but these two jagged ends
Oh please, please, please help me heal
I can't do it by myself'cause there's no way I can deal
With all this misery and weary weight I feel
Oh please, please, please help me heal
My heart's been shattered by this unholy life
Each day when I get up, I feel the cracks inside
Look in the mirror, see no one that I know
Now all I'm praying for is a chance you'll make me whole
Oh please, please, please help me heal
I can't do it by myself
there's no way I can deal
With all this misery and weary weight I feel
Oh please, please, please help me heal
Just let me lay my troubles in your redeeming hands
If anyone can mend me, Lord, I know you can
Please, please, please, help me heal
I can't do it by myself
there's no way I can deal
With all this misery and weary weight I feel
Oh please, please, please help me here
Oh Lord please, please, please help me here
