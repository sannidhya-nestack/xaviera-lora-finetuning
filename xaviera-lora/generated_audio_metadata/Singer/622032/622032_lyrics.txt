Once I was on my own
That was then so long ago
I could just walk this earth
Alone with just my very own
Thoughts and odd troubles on my mind
Now wrapped in my heart and soul
Your love is mine, it's mine to hold
But so too troubles on my mind
Love is the ebb and flow
It's sometimes yes and sometimes no
Look at how we've both grown
So much more, much more than old
Always share the highs and lows
Sometimes mine, sometimes yours
Mm, troubles on my mind
Take the love and leave the rest
You reflect my very best
Even with troubles on my mind
Love is the ebb and flow
It's sometimes yes and sometimes no
Look at how we've both grown
So much more, much more than, much more than old
Always share the highs and lows
Sometimes mine and sometimes yours
Always share the highs and lows
Sometimes mine and sometimes yours
Sometimes mine and sometimes yours
No troubles on my mind
No troubles on my mind
No, no troubles on my mind
No more troubles on my ebb and flow
Sometimes yes and sometimes no
Love is the ebb and flow
Love is the ebb and flow
