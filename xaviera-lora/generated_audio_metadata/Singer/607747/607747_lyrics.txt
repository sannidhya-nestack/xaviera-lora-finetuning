Don't want to be too soon otten
But it isn't in my hands
Don't want to be too soon otten
But it isn't in my hands
And now I am cold
I am cold
Like a man crouching naked
At the bottom of the world
And now I am cold
I am cold
Like a man crouching naked
At the bottom of the world
Don't want to know where you are going
Makes no difference to me
Don't want to know where you are going
Makes no difference to me
Now I am cold
I am cold
Like a man crouching naked
At the bottom of the world
Now I am cold
I am cold
Like a man crouching naked
At the bottom of the world
Now I am cold
I am cold like a man crouching naked at the bottom of the world
