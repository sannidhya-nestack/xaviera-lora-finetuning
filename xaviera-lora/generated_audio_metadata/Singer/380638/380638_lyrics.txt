It wasn't me who told you that was it we were through
There's no alternative we can't implement
And got on with my day like I'd thrown you away
And said if I was king things would be different
And do I leave you alone when we talk on the phone
Do my lips move but nothing gets answered
And do I string you along when you turned up I gone
And said I warned you about my
Indifference, whoa
Down, down, down, I don't give a damn
Down, down, I don't understand
Down, down, down, I don't wanna know
Down, down feels like letting go
And do I say I believe, cheat and lie and deceive
And blame it all on good people and circumstance
And run away with the race like a slap in the face
And say I admire you'cause you went ahead and took a chance
And do I go to the wall, no intention at all
To throw a line when I get to the other side
I kick and dirt in your eyes, do I fall as I rise
And say I warned you about my
Indifference, whoa
Down, down, down, I don't give a damn
Down, down, I don't understand
Down, down, down, I don't wanna know
Down, down, feels like letting go
It's twelve years in and I think I got it figured out
It's twelve long years and I think I know what this is about
Don't even try to explain, I can't believe what you're saying
You're telling me time is going to be my deliverance
So get your foot off my head, I heard everything that you said
You're holding me down but you insult my intelligence
I want to look in the mirror, no longer living in fear
Of a consequence of my actions
I'm dragging a comb through my hair, singing life wasn't fair
Until I learned myself a little
You're just a little
Here we go now
Down, down, down, I don't give a damn
Down, down, I don't understand
Down, down, down, I don't wanna know
Down, down, feels like letting go
I don't give a damn
I don't understand, I don't wanna know
Feels like letting go
Feels like letting go
