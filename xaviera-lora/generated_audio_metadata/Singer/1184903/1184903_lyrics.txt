She's curled up like a cat on a patch of sunlight
Stretches her body in the morning
She keeps a journal of her dreams and talks to Jesus
Then she knows where she's going
Cause she's from somewhere
So many stars, it's hard to count'em
She's a cool drink of heaven when I'm going through hell, hell
She gets her water from a deeper well
She shines like a starlight, little pixie in her smile
She flows like a slow moving stream
Late in the evening, she's my lover, she's my healer
And in the morning, she's the girl from my dreams
her love takes me high up in the mountains
So many stars, it's hard to count'em
She's a cool drink of heaven when I'm going through hell, hell
She gets her water from a deeper well
Oh, when I get thirsty, she's gonna quench it
When hard times come nothing's stronger than her friendship and her love
High up in the mountains
So many stars, it's hard to count'em
She's a cool drink of heaven when I'm going through hell
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She gets her water from a deeper well
Yeah
