I've been down a lonesome road and I held my head up high
No one gave a helping hand
They just smiled and walked on by
Didn't hear no voice or reason
Didn't see a guiding light
Just those voices in my head
Screaming get me through the night
It's a fine line between heaven and hell
Cause if it feels good I guess you should
Let the devil help you out
As everyone gets down
No one sees, no one tells
It's a fine line between heaven and hell
I stood strong when I was weak but had a drink by my side
It eased me and it pleased me while it held on to my pride
No need to look no further I see that guiding light
There's a fire burning brightly and there's a party here tonight
It's a fine line between heaven and hell
'Cause if it feels good, I guess you should
Let the devil help you out
everyone gets down
No one sees, no one tells
It's a fine line between heaven and hell
It's a fine line between heaven and hell
(Dogs barking)
I don't care about what's right, I'm too busy doing wrong
If it bothers you to hear my words, don't listen to my song
Cause everyone does suffer, yeah we all have the right
And we all do what we have to do just to make us feel alright
It's a fine line between heaven and hell
'Cause if it feels good I guess you should
Let the devil help you out
everyone gets down
No one sees, no one tells
It's a fine line between heaven and hell
It's a fine line between heaven and hell
It's a fine line between heaven and hell
