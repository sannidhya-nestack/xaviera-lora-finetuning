In the daybreak when the sunrise fills the sky
You know the moments when the planets have all aligned
In her eyes I feel the warming of the sun
The way she moves I come undone
No, you're missing her right now she said
Sitting on the park bench
Wish you would come be there now I bet
You are such a lucky man I am
Spare the time when you can
I need to see your face
Wash myself in the words she says
And try to keep the pace
I lay down my head and think of you (no)
You're missing her right now, she said
Sitting on the park bench, you know
Wish you could be there now, I bet
You were such a lucky man, I am
Oh, oh, oh, oh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You're missing her right now she said
Sitting on the park bench
Wish you could be there now I bet
You were such a low key man
You're missing her right now she said
Sitting on the poor bench
Wish you couldn't be there and now I've found
You are such a lucky man that I am
