As a little girl I was taught the ways of Christ
I thought by going to church it would suffice
My mom, well she was sure that I should be
The kind of person you'd expect to see
My heart could not be further from the truth
As I ventured far from God throughout my youth
I was searching for some freedom in my soul
And direction for some peace to make me whole
Then came Jesus, the anointed one
Then came Jesus, the victorious son
It was Jesus who knew all of my strife
Now it's Jesus who rules my life
I found a love on which I could depend
It gave me hope that I could just pretend
It took control of every part of me
And kept me chained to sin I could not see
But in that moment, that moment when I saw the light
Oh, when I listened to the spirit tell me right
I gave my heart to Jesus then and there
Oh and He took my sin and showed His loving care
Then came Jesus, the anointed one
Then came Jesus, the victorious son
It was Jesus who knew all of my strife
Now it's Jesus who rules my life
Then
Then, then, then came Jesus, the anointed one
Then came Jesus, the victorious son
Yeah, there was Jesus who knew all of my strife
Now it's Jesus, now it's Jesus
Now it's Jesus, now it's Jesus, yeah, rules my life
