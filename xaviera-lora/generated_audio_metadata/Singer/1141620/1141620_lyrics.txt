Don't come close
You know you'll be in trouble when you go
Don't check your phone, it's out of your control
Remember how we used to push and go
Push and go, take it slow
The devil's really trying to steal my soul
Does anybody really have to know
I guess that they don't
Oh God, no
Don't make me go down this broken road
I'm losing all my goddamn self-control
I hope I have enough but I just don't
I just don't
You're my black hole
Falls so deep can't find my way back home
The toxic taste so good until you choke
Pretty little lies all take their toll
How can I say no
Brown eyes soft but daggers on my heart
There's nothing left I'm all dust and bones
Here we go
Oh God no
Don't make me go down this broken road
I'm losing all my goddamn self control
I hope I have enough but I just don't
I just don't
I just don't, I just don't
I thought I had enough
But I just don't
I have a lack of self control
Or maybe I just can't let go
Oh God, no
Oh God no
Don't make me go down this broken road
I'm losing all my goddamn self control
I hope I have enough but I just don't
I just don't
Ooh
I don't have control, oh God no, oh God no
