I saw you, my friend
I saw you one last time
I feel awake and I'm listening
Are you okay, are you okay, are you okay tonight?
I dream in blues and greens
And I saw your face again
I feel life and I'm listening
Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay?
I've been dreaming a lot these days
Picking up the scattered pieces
And if my dreams were wings
I'd fly away from here
I've been thinking of all the ways
That I could get back what I'm missing
And if my dreams were wings
I'd fly away from here
I'd fly away from here
And in the end
All the colors bleed
I feel awake and I'm listening
Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay?
I've been dreaming a lot these days
Picking up the scattered pieces
And if my dreams were wings
I'd fly away from here
And I've been thinking of all the ways
That I could get back what I'm missing
And if my dreams were wings
I'd fly away from here
Ooh, let's fly away from here
Yeah, are you okay?
