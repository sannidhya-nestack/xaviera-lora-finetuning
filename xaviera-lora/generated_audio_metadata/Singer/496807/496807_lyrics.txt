A tour of the ladder
No need to read them anymore
I carried one more suitcase
Turned out the lights and closed the door
Memories have a weekend
No need to live a busy life
it's gone
All gone
Gone away
I'm sure you'll be angry
You'll think I've just deserted you
The pattern of your thinking
Is like the sun or morning dew
So when you finally read this
Just take a couple of your pills'cause it's gone, all gone, gone away
Yes, it's getting colder
Beginning's never easy now
Now that we're older
Complacency grows stronger
So I had to make a move
And I hope that you'll make one too
it's gone, all gone, gone away
Yeah, mmm, oh, oh
