I bit myself today
Lost all my self-control
I'm such a bloody mess
With duct tape it won't show
I strap these feelings on
With grappling hooks and chains
And carefully contemplate
How guilt can leave a bloody stain
Shipwrecked far from home
This crisis of my youth
Come join my battle zone
If you want the truth
Oh, I'll give you proof
My mind on reservoir
Of crazy crooked pain
My spirit's still at war with my demons
I don't dare to name
They have my name
Oh, I drag my crooked leg
Down the streets I used to own
And wrap my bleeding soul
blessings I should have known
Now in my cheater's chair
I carefully cut and paste
My precious thoughts and dreams
To please the judge and the magistrate
Shipped red far from home, this crisis of my youth
Come join my battle zone if you want the truth
I will give you proof, my mind a reservoir
Of crazy crooked pain
My spirit still at war with demons
I don't dare to name, they have my name
With a felon's sense of pride
And a convict's private greed
I tempt the gods to turn on me
But I only steal what I need
What do I need?
Now I'm shipwrecked far from home
This crisis of my youth
Come join my battle zone
If you want the truth
My mind a reservoir
Of crazy crooked pain
My spirit still at war
With my demons
They know my name
They know my name
