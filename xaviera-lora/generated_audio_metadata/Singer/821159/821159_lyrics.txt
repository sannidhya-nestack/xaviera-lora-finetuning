The house falls down, goes through the motions
Replays the scenes that took the fight right out of me
Half a mind of doublespeak
I'm a blind man who thinks that he can see
You and your favorite enemy
Me and my fearless apathy
Up to our necks now more or less
You in that dress
You came to me
To set me free
Talk about a bittersweet release
And so I stand, foolscap in hand
And a dusty picture on the mantelpiece
Of you and your favorite gracious smile
Me and mine missing by a mile
Up to our necks now more or less
And you in that dress
I must confess
Could I change my mind a thousand times every day
We're dead and buried, we're old news
Tramping old dirt down with new shoes
We lost it all now more or less
But you in that dress
