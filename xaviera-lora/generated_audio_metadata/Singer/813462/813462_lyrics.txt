We came upon a temple with a solemn atmosphere
But the Davanin was deafening and bloody it up
So we moved on to a chapel with a father and a son
But the place was haunted by a holy ghost that frightened everyone
Looking for meaning held by ones who came before
Nothing's needed at the core
We're searching for the answer said the seeker to the sage
Who took us all down to Bollywood
To help us disengage
The leading lady is Sitar Star
Wooters on the stage
She turned the whole house on
With a live set sang
That felt more like a rave
Looking for meaning
Held by ones who came before
Nothing's needed at the core
We came upon a pathway over
Grown with pop gurus
They were offering maps to nowhere
How could we refuse?
We don't need direction when there's nowhere to explore
So we put away our compass, we didn't need it anymore
Getting out of our own way and the ones who came before
Nothing's closer than the core
Only those illusions held by ones who came before
Nothing's closer than the core
Nothing is needed at the core
