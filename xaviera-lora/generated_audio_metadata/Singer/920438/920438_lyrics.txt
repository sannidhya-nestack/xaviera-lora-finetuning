This time the water was deep
For miles we felt like we're dying
At night when you fell asleep
I kissed your beautiful body
We used to be young and the world was small
We wanted each other and we had it all
You were my queen and I'll always love you, oh oh oh
You were my dream and I laid down my life
You were my queen and I'll work hard for you, oh oh oh
You were my dream for the rest of my life
'Cause no one else that I want
There's nothing else I desire
Then hold your beautiful hands
As long as my eyes have fire
Have I treated you right, have I made you laugh?
Can you see the love when you're looking back
You are my queen and I'll always love you, oh oh oh
You are my dream and I'll lay down my life
You are my queen and I'll work hard for you, oh oh oh
You are my dream for the rest of my life
Life is too short to be short on love
Nobody in the world has ever had too much
Baby thank you, thank you, thank you
For loving me always
You are my queen and I'll always love you
You are my dream and I'll lay down my life
You are my queen and I'll work hard for you
You are my dream for the rest of my life
You are my queen and I'll always love you, oh oh oh
You are my dream and I'll lay down my life (I will lay down my life for you)
You are my queen and I'll work hard for you, oh oh oh
You are my dream for the rest of my life
Ooh, you were my dream
