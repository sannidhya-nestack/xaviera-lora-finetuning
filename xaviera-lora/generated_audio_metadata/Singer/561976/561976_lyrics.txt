If you had one chance to begin again
Would you change it all for a better
And I sure will
In your end
Endless strife and your broken life
Did you lose belief? Did you?
'Cause nothing was real, I sure would
If you had the time
Would you walk the line
Or just play it safe
Bring it down
Zero pace
I sure would
If I could
It's all good
Oh if it's good
