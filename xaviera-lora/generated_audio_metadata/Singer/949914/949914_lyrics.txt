We came to the same conclusion
About how the people are drifting in closed circles
We may come from different places
But tonight we tried to reach for something to talk about
Beneath the cozy lanterns, wanna stay for a while
Watching people smile in this place
Many different faces
Come from different places
All these leaves from different trees are sharing the same space
You gave
I need some inspiration
Gratitude is nudging me to tell you all I know tonight
Beneath the cozy lanterns
Wanna stay for a while
Watching people smile in this place
Leave them these close circles
Leave them these close circles
Leave them these close circles
Leave them these close circles behind
Beneath the cozy lanterns
Wanna stay for a while
Watching people smile in this place
