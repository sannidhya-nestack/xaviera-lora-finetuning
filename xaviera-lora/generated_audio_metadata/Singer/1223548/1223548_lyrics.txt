Your smell still on my pillow
Your taste still in my mouth
And the words you whispered
Still echo in this house
All the I love you's and beautiful promises
Keep playing in my head
Lie beside me underneath the cloak of night
when we lie
I lose myself in dreams of you and I
Though I know it's all illusion
It feels so real to me when we lie
Sometimes I wish that you'd be a little less sincere
I much prefer a mystery to an open book of tears
I'm not asking for too much, I think you've said enough
Hold your truth and close your eyes
And a light beside me underneath the cloak of a night
Cause the world
When we lie
I lose myself in dreams of you and I
Though I know it's all illusion
It feels so real to me when we lie
With such an angel's face how very easy you deceive
But when I'm lying in your arms it's hard not to believe
Lie beside me underneath the cloak of a night
when we lie
I lose myself in dreams of you and I
Though I know it's all illusion
It feels so real to me as long as we lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
