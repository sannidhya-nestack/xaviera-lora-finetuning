Hmm, hmm
It started on the Emerald Isle
With a boy, a girl and a smile
And she, a princess by all rights
In heat-tending bars, working nights
And their love grew strong as they made a start
But blind eyes wouldn't see into their hearts
And for the sake of love they sacrificed
And ran away to start a wedded life
But time goes by and I know just why
That he and she
Are the perfect two to me
they are what I pray
I will be one day
One day
Hmm
Hard times
There have been hard times
When you never thought you'd make it through
When life kicked hard and brought you to your knees
Who was the one that stood by you
Through the joy and tears
Hand in hand through the years go you
And he, you're the perfect two for me
Today, it's your day
See how far you've come
Look how far you've come
My song is all I have
So these words I give to you
In each other's eyes
You will find your prize
That's all you need to do
'Cause he and she are the perfect two to me
And they are what I pray I can be one day
Ooh, ooh, ooh
And you and he show what love should be
By how far you've come
Look how far you've come
Look how far you've come
