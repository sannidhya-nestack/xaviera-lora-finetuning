I've been thinking'bout the people I've seen
And the way they walk and the way they'll be
It's something I just have to learn to accept
Oh, it's burning on that old gas stove
Yeah, stupid me, I don't even know
I guess the obvious just seems to slip on by
Well, I don't see what you see
And I don't hear
And I don't smile like you smile
It's a long, long road that we all ride on
We all have our own roads to ride
Well, I've been wondering what to do
It's 6 a .m., my buzz ain't through
I guess I should just try to go to sleep
Walking down that old straight road
It's harder than anything I know
I guess it's best just to travel it on your own
Well I don't see what you see
And I don't hear what you hear
And I don't smile like you smile
It's a long, long road that we all ride on
We all have our own roads to ride
I don't see what you see
And I don't hear what you hear
And I don't smile like you smile
It's a long long road that we all ride on
We all have our own roads to ride
We all have our own roads to ride
