Tell me why you came to me
Like the river flows to the sea
Tell me why I feel this pain
Tears washed away with the rain
I didn't know where it was going
Couldn't find the strength to say
You were my only companion
Your black heart guides my way
Cast out just like a leopard
Cast down upon my knees
Your cruel words and hurtful stare
Became a part of me
And I tried not to notice
Solace became my throne
Whenever I felt the loneliness
Your black heart guides me home
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh
So you thought you'd teach me
Ways of this hopeless land
Encased me within your boundary
Lost in eternal hell
And I tried not to notice
Solace became my throne
You are still my companion
And your black heart still guides me home, home
