Now my sister right behind me
Stalking slowly hoping that I fall
I feel your back there breathing like a predator
Behind a silent wall
Nemesis, you're shifty and you're dark inside
You try to keep me down
Do what you will, your intentions paralyze
Just you in the end
Tell my sister you're cold and sometimes sinister
But you don't fool me, no
I've seen nothing's good and you release all of your insecurities, yeah
Nemesis, you're shifty and you're dark inside
You try to keep me down
Do what you will, your intentions paralyze
Just you and the end
Nemesis, you're shifty and you're dark inside
You try to keep me down
Do what you will, your intentions paralyze just you in the end
