There is a land where a brother can stand
Where a sister can find room to breathe
So take my hand, come walk with me
To the promised land, cross the sea
We will follow the stars
We will dance in the night
We'll play a symphony
Interpure light
As we nourish our souls in eternity
There is a land, it tugs at our hearts
It's where humans go, where life starts
Take my hand, be mortal for sure
We'll find true bliss, final cure
We will follow the stars
We will dance in the night
We'll play a symphony
Interpolite
As we nourish our souls in eternity
The heroes we love
Are all gathered there
And they beckon to us
To show that they care
We will follow the stars
We will dance in the night
We'll play a symphony
Interpolite
As we nourish our souls in eternity
