Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Underneath my thinning skin there's an empty space
Once filled in with a tattered world, a faded broken heart
That hollow place was full of you
I tied a wave on a sea of blue
Where I laid my anchor to the wind
That's a long way back
That's a long way back from here
As white as snow on purity
You shone a light on my obscurity
A new return I gave you twenty years
And you kept my feet on solid ground
But itchy feet don't stick around
So with a bloody nose I hit that muddy road again
That's a long way back
That's a long way back from here
That's a long way back
That's a long way back from here
Now I never look at photographs
Those memories will never last
They'll always wash away in tomorrow's rain
Your broken eyes and the mitre bends
Will blow away in Hokkaido's wind
And I guess it's all just better left unsaid
that's a long way back
That's a long way back from here
'Cause that's a long way back
That's a long way back from here
that's a long way back
That's a long way back from here
that's a long way back
'Cause that's the long way back from here
that's the long way back, that's the long way back
That's the long way back, that's the long way back
That's the long way back, oh yeah
That's the long way back, oh yeah
