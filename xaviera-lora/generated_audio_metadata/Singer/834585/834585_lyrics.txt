It's Christmas time, oh what a time
It's Christmas time, oh what a time
When you play the song in reverse you see the light
It's Christmas time, oh what a time
It's Christmas time, oh what a time
When you play the song in reverse you see the light
You know it's true, God's gift to the human race
So we stick together, we stay together, we share the joy
Sharing Jesus Christ
It's Christmas time, oh what a time
It's Christmas time, oh what a time
When you play the song in reverse you see the light
It's Christmas time, oh what a time
It's Christmas time, oh what a time
When you play the song in reverse, you see the light
It's Christmas time, oh what a time
