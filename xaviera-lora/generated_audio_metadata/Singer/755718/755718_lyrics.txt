You're bringing me up
You're bringing me down, down, down
You're bringing me everywhere
I'm lost and I'm safe and sound
I don't know where we're going
I know that I wanna be with you
I don't know where we are
Or what we're gonna do
I packed up my old life, it fit in his old suitcase
He called it my crisis, I call it L .A.
And I am still on that journey, got all the time and miles hence known
You've given me hope that I won't travel this road alone
Beautiful man, come on in
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful man
Beautiful man, know who I am
Sing with me, try me, you beautiful man
Born in a rainstorm
You carry the wind with you
Oh how I love it
The pilgrim in you
I'm over this world of strangers
I'm dying to let somebody in
After so long in silence
I'm willing to start again
Beautiful man, where do I begin?
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful man
I'm saying amen, please let me in
I have some questions that I need to ask
I'm tired man
Alone there's no end
I'm lonely for only you beautiful man
Beautiful man
Come on in
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful man
Beautiful man, know who I am
Sing with me, tell me you're a beautiful man
Beautiful man, beautiful man
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful man
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
