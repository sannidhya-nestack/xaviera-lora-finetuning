Don't you miss me
Don't you need me
I can't remember who I was before I met you
I can't remember who I was at all
Finally found love
Finally broke through
I finally let go
Only to lose you
Don't you miss me?
Don't you need me?
I know I'm worth more than this
But this is all I've got
I know my life is bigger than this
But this is all my life
Finally found love
Finally broke through
I finally let go
Only to lose you
You don't want me now
This is who I am
You don't want me now
This is who I am
Finally found love
Finally broke through
I finally let go
Only to lose you
I finally found love
I finally broke through
I finally let go
Only to lose you
I finally found love
I finally broke through
I finally let go
Only to lose you
