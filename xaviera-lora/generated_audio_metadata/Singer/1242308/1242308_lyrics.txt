Some pretend that they don't see him
Walking in oblivion
Even though they pass him everyday
Shadow in the cityscape
Ragged shoes and rugged face
I couldn't help but notice him today
I looked him in the eyes
To see what I could see
It was then I realized that man could be me
Spread a little love tonight, spread a little love
Spread a little love tonight, that's all I wanna do
Spread a little love tonight, spread a little love
Spread a little love tonight, that's all I'm tryna do
Little girl is new in town
And all the kids can see she's different
Sitting in the school yard all alone
Looking for a better life
To escape the sorrow and the strife
Her parents trying to find a better home
I looked her in the eyes
To see what I could see
It was then I realized that girl could be me
Spread a little love tonight
Spread a little love
Spread a little love tonight
That's all I wanna do
Spread a little love tonight
Spread a little love
Spread a little love tonight
I'm trying
A little less hopeless
A little less hurt
That's all I want for you
A little more caring, a little more love
That's all I want
Spread a little love
Spread a little love tonight
Spread a little love tonight, spread a little love
Spread a little love tonight, that's all I wanna do
Spread a little love tonight, spread a little love
Spread a little love tonight, that's all I'm tryna do
Mmm, that's all I want for you
