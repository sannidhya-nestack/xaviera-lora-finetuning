My most depressing days came a bit before nineteen and twenty nine
Grandad now he was a slave
And in many ways his master also became mine
Just a common carpenter
I planned to work hard all of my days
But my dreams got a little too big for those Alabama ways
So I came up north to Louisville
To see what I could build
And when I tried to work hard here, well now
They weren't exactly thrilled
And I find that it's the same about everywhere I go
But at least right here in Kentucky
I've got something I can show
Hello, I'm Samuel, the last name is Plato
But no one expected smart things from me
And then I decided that others won't determine what
I can do or who I'll be
Well since they wouldn't work with me
I struck out on my own
And I learned how to build
In spite of how little I had been shown
I designed schools and churches
And barracks during the war
I built 39 post offices and 400 houses
Or maybe more
I had so many employees over the course of all my years
Now I'm not trying to brag
But even those who once wouldn't work with me
They came calling in their careers
Now here's my point
Cause now I had something to offer
I had something that they could use
I shook their hands and I welcomed them in
It would be petty to refuse
Hello, I'm Samuel, the last name is Plato
But no one expected smart things from me
And then I decided that others won't determine what I can do or who I'll be
My proudest accomplishment was a mill with bricks of wood
You won't find it on a street corner in any neighborhood
It's just this little feeling
It's way down deep inside
That others coming up behind me
Can have a little more enterprise
Hello, I'm Samuel, the last name is Plato
But no one expected smart things from me
And then I decided that others won't determine what
Can't do or who I'll be
Hello, I'm Samuel, the last name is Plato
But no one expected smart things from me
And then I decided that others won't determine what
I can do or who I'll be
