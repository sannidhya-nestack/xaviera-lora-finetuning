Just like a smile from a child, it's been a while
Can I be happy all the time?
Birds in spring do a dance and then they sing
It makes me happy every time
And in the morning, can you wake up in my shoes? (Yes)
Oh, what a joy it is to see you
You can grow that feeling right beneath your feet (Yeah)
If you wanna be happy, then just be, uh (Hey)
It's happiness, let's get it right
It's your choice, so you decide
It's beautiful, let's go out tonight
We'll try to love with all our might
And I wanna lead a life that's full
Take my time, no schedule
Feels so good, it warms my soul
Be someone who can be loved
Not just live for what's above
It's all about the here and now
Maybe I shouldn't try so hard
Open up, let down my guard
Find balance on my own
But time is precious, so are you
Believe me when I say it's true
Can I be happy all the time?
Uh
Hey
Savviness, let's get it right
It's your choice, so you decide
It's beautiful, let's go out tonight
We try to love with all our might
And I don't know if what I say is always true
But you can find happiness somewhere beyond the blue
If you want the flower then don't try to deny again
We live and we love my friend
We could say goodbye but I always will reply
Because you make me happy all the time
Uh hey
Sabiness let's get it right
It's your choice, so you decide
It's beautiful, let's go out tonight
We'll try to love with all our might
It's happiness, let's get it right
It's your choice, so you decide
It's beautiful, let's go out tonight
Try to love with all our might
