Huddled in a pawn shop doorway
Hiding from the stingin' lay
He's got a white knuckle grip on an old Gibson
The only thing left to his name
He's got roaches for roommates
But they don't help pay the rent
He's got a photo in his shirt pocket
Of a girl in a wedding dress
Oh we all fall down
The rabbit hole chasing fools gone
But this is no wonderland Alice
No, no
This is no wonderland
His knuckles are swollen and raw
From knocking on a thousand doors
With every rejection the light in his eyes dims a little more
He chews on a broken pen and wonders how his story ends
Says he knew he was in the morning
But changed a few times since then
We all fall down
The rabbit hole
Chasing fools gold
But this is no
Wonderland, Alice
No, no
This is no wonderland
But the greyhounds keep dropping on
More of us with our own dreams
It's all so curious
How we still believe impossible things, yeah
We all fall down the rabbit hole
Oh we all fall down
The rabbit hole chasing fools gone
But this is no wonderland Alice, no no
This is no wonderland
This is no wonderland
This is no wonderland
This is no wonderland
