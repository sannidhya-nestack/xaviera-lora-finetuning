I was lost in a maze
I was stunned and amazed
Faces I'd watched inside was never there
I'm never there
In your shoes, I walked the line
Played your role, I played it well
I've seen your pain, I've felt the shame
Cause being you was never true
So see you later, my friend
Though we won't meet again
I'll see ya in dreams
I miss you still
Yeah, I miss you still
Chances are you were far too far
From who you were
You're gone, that's just wrong
I can't pretend it didn't end
So see you later, my friend
Though it won't meet again
I'll see ya in dreams
I'll miss you still
Yeah, I'll miss you still
Yeah, I'll miss you still
