Stop your procreating, way too many kids
Stop your masturbating, grab your landing skids
Stop matriculating, shut down all the schools
No more celebrating
All these foolish rules
Look the other way when you talk to me
Seagulls soar with majesty through cold and blustery winds
Ocean currents rip the sand as nature just begins
When man has found his calling be it day or in the night
A festival of brawling leads his soul through random flight
Do not take my hand, show me no concern
Focus on yourself, not your fellow man
Life cannot be steered
Best that we can hope
Haphazard hit or miss
Message as we grow
Seagulls soar with majesty
Through cold and blustery winds
Ocean torrents rip the sand
As nature just begins
When madness felt his calling
Be it day or in the night
A festival of brawling
Leads his soul through random flight
Hear the howling screams of wind
Scratching devil's door
Shield the ever present twins
Leaking on the floor
Seagulls soar with majesty through cold and blustery winds
Ocean torrents rip the sand as nature just begins
When man has found his calling, be it day or in the night
A festival of brawling leads his soul through random flight
