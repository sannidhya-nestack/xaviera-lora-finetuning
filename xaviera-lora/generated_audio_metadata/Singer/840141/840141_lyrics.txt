Picture yourself looking out a window as far as eyes can see
Picture yourself standing in the meadow
While flowers blowing in the breeze
And if I fall before I crawl
It's meant to be
Standing tall through it all
Cause I believe
Picture yourself sitting in the sunlight
Watching the birds fly by
Picture yourself hugging a child
Wiping a tear from their eyes
And if I fall before I crawl it's meant to be
Standing tall through it all'cause I believe
Picture a new beginning where time stands still
Picture yourself winning
Where I can't becomes I will
Picture yourself floating up to heaven
A million angels by your side
Picture yourself looking back on your life and thinking
One wonderful ride
And if I fall before I crawl
It's meant to be
Standing tall
Throw it all
Cause I believe
If I fall before I crawl
It's meant to be
Standing tall, throw it all
Cause I believe
What a wonderful life
