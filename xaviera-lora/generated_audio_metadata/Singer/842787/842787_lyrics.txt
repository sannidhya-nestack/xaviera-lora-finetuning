I think about the winter now and how it wouldn't end
Lay me on a sandy beach and throw away the key
I'm ready for the sun to shine and drinking with some friends
In summertime that's finally when we're free
Grab the lotion and the cooler filled with ice
Bring the party if you can
We've got to live it like we've never done before
This time let's take it all away
We've got to give it like there isn't anymore
There couldn't be a better day
Everyone's recovering from issues in this life
You and I have had our darker days
Coping with the a-holes and the worry and the strife
Do you like two limes with your tank of ray?
Pick your potion and don't worry'bout the price
And please bring the party if you can
We've got to live it like we've never done before
This time let's take it all away
We've got to give it like there isn't anymore
There couldn't be a better day
Who knows where we'll go when
Let's be here now
We've got to live it like we've never done before (never done before)
This time let's take it all the way (never done before)
We've got to give it like there isn't anymore (isn't anymore)
We've got all day and night to play (isn't anymore)
We've got to live it like we've never done before (never done before)
This time let's take it all away (we've never done before)
We've got to give it like there isn't anymore (isn't anymore)
There couldn't be a better day
We've never done before
Like we've never done before
There isn't anymore
Like there isn't anymore
We've never done before
Like we've never done
We've never done before
