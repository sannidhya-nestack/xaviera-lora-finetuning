Winter goes in circles, ice on every tree
Snowflakes fall around me
A light on the evergreen
And it was too cold out
For every bit of you
To stand up in
Sliding on you'til they know
Falling towards the rivers end and freezing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Winter comes in circles
Spinning on the edge of the leaves
Drowning in the water
Windows where I couldn't see
And it was too cold out for every bit of you to stand up in
Sliding on it'til they know
Falling towards the rivers end and freezing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
