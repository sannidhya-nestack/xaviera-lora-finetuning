Thought I was your prize
You had me up so high
Said I was the only one
You were just a boy playing me for fun
And I gave you love and I gave you trust but you took it all away
Made me believe I was everything then you threw me away
Like a broken doll for hours to fall
And shattered because of you like a broken doll
All I ever was to you
And you held my heart out
You swung it to the ground
Watched my world crash down
And you broke me
I'm a broken doll
I'm a broken doll
You left
Me in pieces
Lied so many times now I see it
You set me up just to drag me down after everything I gave
My fragile heart you held in your hands then you threw it away
Like a broken doll for hours to fall
And shattered because of you
Like a broken doll
All I ever was to you
And you held my heart out
You swung it to the ground
Watch my world crash down
And you broke me
I'm a broken doll
I'm a broken doll
Now it's all I can do to stay away from you
I know you'd just break me again
And I hate that I ever gave you a chance
But you'll never break me again
Like a broken door for us to fall
And shattered because of you
Like a broken doll
All I ever was to you
And you held my heart out
And you swung me to the ground
Watched my world crash down
And you broke me
I'm a broken doll
I'm a broken doll
Like a broken doll forced to fall
And shattered because of you
Like a broken doll
All I ever was to you
And you held my heart out
And you swung it to the ground
Watched my world crash down and you broke me
I'm a broken doll
I'm a broken doll
