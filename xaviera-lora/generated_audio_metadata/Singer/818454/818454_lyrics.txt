Good people find their own way of doing things
She packed her bags in the winter and left in the spring
Last seen on a railway platform
Soaked to the skin
Or her pretty face
From an airport window
Looking over an airplane wing
I got a call from Ireland
Said they seen the most beautiful girl
And a text from my friend in Geneva
Said you were laughing
And traveling all over the world
All over the world
All over the world, yeah
I know that in your heart
You're just singing your own song
And I know deep inside that can't be wrong
Still I wish you'd stayed nearer
Can't et the night you said
If I leave here by sunset
By morning I'll be someplace else instead
I got a call from China
Said they've seen the most beautiful girl
And a text from a friend in Bogota
Said you were crying
But traveling all over the world
All over the world
All over the world, yeah
Saying goodbye
And if I leave at sunset, I'll be there by morning
If I leave unnoticed, I might leave without warning
The night is so cold, but inside I'm burning
I know we can't go together
But I'll let you know where I'm going
