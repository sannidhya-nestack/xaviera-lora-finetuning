And mama help me pack my bags
Go steal a car and change the tanks
Mama won't you get me out of here
And yeah I've done it wrong
Broke the law now I'm on the run
Mama won't you get me out of here
No, it won't be long'til it catches up to me
Fear will never set me free
Get out west or no town
Call it quits, maybe settle down
Do as I wanna, do as I feel
Nothing'll get me down
Nothing'll get me down
Nothing'll get me down, no (come on)
Or maybe if I had my way
Change it all and start today
By looking in a different point of view
But no, it's not to be
The criminal is stuck to me
Guess there's just one thing to do, Q, yeah
It won't be long'til it catches up to me
Rebel, ain't what I wanna be, no
Get out west to know a town
Call it quits, maybe settle down
Do as I wanna, do as I feel
Nothing'll get me down
Nothing'll get me down
Nothing'll get me down, no
And baker's feet heal
Where is it?
No, it won't be long'til the cash is up to me
I'm a rebel, ain't what I wanna be
Could I win us another town?
Call it quits, let'em settle down
I'll do as I wanna, do as I feel
Nothing to get me down
Nothing to get me down
Nothing to get me down, no
In Bakersfield
Nothing to get me down
Nothing to get me down
Nothing to get me down, no
