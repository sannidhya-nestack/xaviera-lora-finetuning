I've said this before
I'll say it a thousand times more
you don't always hear
When the real stuff gets near
You nod, fidget, take a sip of your beer
Tomorrow's cancelled due to lack of interest
I guess that you meant well and nobody's perfect
But all I can see is this flame in your eye
It's dancing, it's fighting the night
It's a flickering light
Concealed in a smile, wrapped up in a coat
Unwieldy, awkward, cracking a joke
The front gate sticks and the backyards a mess
Somebody once told me that you can only do your best
Tomorrow's cancelled due to lack of interest
I guess that she meant well that nobody's perfect
But all I can see is this flame in your eye
It's dancing, it's fighting all night
It's a flickering light
I wept in the darkness and it brought right back at me
Something insane and reckless came over me
Enlightened me, brightened me, helped me begin
Once more from the top till the day that I drown
In pride and in downfall
In prayer and in blasphemy
I look in the mirror
You're staring right back at me
Now I can see it's a fire in your eye
It's dancing, it lights up the night
It never will die
