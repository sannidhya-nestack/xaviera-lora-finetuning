If I just believe I know I can get there
Though struggling through these obstacles really is a bear
Still I'm dedicated just one thing holds me back
When my inspirations are suddenly hijacked
Step outside your dream, son
Hands up on the car
Pass the legal speed, son
You might go too far
Ain't no freedom here, son
Who you think you are?
Step outside your dream, son
Hands up on the car, oh
In the hood I'll do some good
Success will breed content
Rising up from poverty is my full intent
I'll soar above and find a way
I know it will come true
Even if these efforts sometimes block what's in plain view
Step outside your dreams, son
Hands up on the car
Pass the legal speed, son
You might go too far
Ain't no freedom here, son, just who you think you are
Step outside your dreams, son, hands up on the car
My moral ground is well intact, anger set aside
One day harassment at my back won't be where I reside
Won't be where I reside
Step outside your dream, son
Hands up on the car
Past illegal speed, son
You might go too far
Ain't no freedom here, son
Just who you think you are
Step outside your dream, son
Hands up on the car
Oh, hands up on the clock
Step outside your dreams, son
