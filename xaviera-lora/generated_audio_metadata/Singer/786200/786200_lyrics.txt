Well nothing's going your way
There's nothing gonna make you come my way
No matter how hard I try
And my eyes when they look at you
They see only a girl who's willing to refuse
Which will take you along for the ride
And I'm folding all my troubles in two
And I'm raising my thumb on down the road
There's a way to go
And you said that I'd never go
But boy did I show you that I would
And I took it all away
Take it away
When nothing's going your way
There's nothing gonna make you come my way
No matter how hard I try
And my eyes when they look at you
They see only a girl who's willing to refuse
Which will take you along for the ride
And take it away
Take it all away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Take it away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
When nothing's going your way, yeah, yeah
Nothing's going your way
When nothing's going your way, yeah, yeah
Nothing's going your way, nothing's going your way
When nothing's going your way, yeah, yeah
When nothing's going your way, nothing's going your way
When nothing's going your way, nothing's going your way
When nothing's going your way, nothing's going your way
When nothing's going your way, nothing's going your way
When nothing's going your way, nothing's going your way
When nothing's going your way, when nothing's going your way
When nothing's going your way, when nothing's going your way
When nothing's going your way, when nothing's going your way
When nothing's going your way, when nothing's going your way, when nothing's going your way, when nothing's going your way, when nothing's going your way, when nothing's going your way, when nothing's going your way, when nothing's going your way, there's nothing gonna make you come my way
