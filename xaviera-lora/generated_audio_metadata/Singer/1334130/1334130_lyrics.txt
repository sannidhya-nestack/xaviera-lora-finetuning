Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Woke up with the rhythm in my chest
Heartbeat pounding like it knows what's next
I used to chase it, used to fall behind
Now I'm walking like the moment's mine
Skipped a few steps, took the long way around
But every wrong turn led to solid ground
I've been waiting for the stars to align
Turns out I was always right on time
Used to doubt the way I shine
Now I see it clear in my own light
I'm not early, not too late
I'm exactly where I'm meant to be
Every breath, every break
Built a better version of me
No rewind, no fast line
But I never miss the climb
Yeah, I got here, I got here
Right on time
Every no just taught me how to grow
Learn to move when the answers go
People come and people fade away
But the ones who matter always stay
Kept my head up when the noise got loud
Made my own path through the shifting crowd
Took a minute but the truth don't lie
Everything good shows up right on time
Used to rush to beat the clock
Now I dance through every storm
I'm not early, not too late
I'm exactly where I'm meant to be
Every breath, every break
Built a better version of me
No rewind, no fast line
But I never miss the climb
Yeah, I got here, I got here
Right on time
No shortcuts, no skipping scenes
Every setback, push the dream
Now I'm standing where I used to pray
Wouldn't trade a single day
I'm not early, not too late
I'm exactly where I'm meant to be
Every breath, every break
Built a better version of me
No rewind, no fast line
But I never miss the climb
Yeah, I got here, I got here
Right on time
Yeah, I got here, I got here
