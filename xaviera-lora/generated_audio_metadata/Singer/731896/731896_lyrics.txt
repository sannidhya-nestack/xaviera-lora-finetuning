It seems like such a waste
Good looks and impeccable taste
For the wrong man
He drove in in a stolen car
Never took you very far
Yeah baby there you are
When's he gonna wake up? I don't know
When's he gonna wake up? I don't know
This time he'll be fine
his wounds they will never heal
He rips at them so he can feel
No need to catch him when he falls
He's just a bleeding heart, that's all
Romeo was such a fool
Smoking weed and skipping school
Somehow that appealed to you
When you gonna wake up, I don't know
When you gonna wake up, I don't know this time
But you'll be fine
He's such an emotional boy
Everything he loves he must destroy
Juliet she could have had it all
He was just a bleeding heart that's all
Baby
You pray as you lay down to sleep
And you cry
Baby
A man for you to fix and keep, but he never calls
When you gonna wake up, I don't know
When you gonna wake up, I don't know this time
But you'll be fine,'cause his wounds they will never heal
So baby what's the big deal
No need to catch him when he falls
He's just a bleeding heart that's all
Now there's something rustling in the breeze
Singing songs and climbing trees
Go back to bed my baby doll
It's just a bleeding heart that's all
