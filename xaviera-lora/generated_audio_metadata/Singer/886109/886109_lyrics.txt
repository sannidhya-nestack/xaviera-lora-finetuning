That sound of my love
When no one is looking
That's my love
When no one is looking
Traffic light
Turning red in the rain
Music's playing
Radio calls out your name
Then a little hum to wake me up, the lights turned green
And I was drifting
Far away, nowhere to be seen
And I, I was drifting
I, oh, I was drifting
That's the sound of my love
When no one is looking
That's my love
When no one is looking
That was the sound of your love
When no one was looking
