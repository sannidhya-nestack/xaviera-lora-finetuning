You think you're so strange
Feeling so weird
You wanna hide
You so wanna change
Don't know what to do
Just wanna cry
But don't you ever feel there's something wrong
'Cause when you're with me, you know that you belong
Always okay to fly your free play, it's cool the way you are
Don't have to try to be so perfect, come just the way you are
If you could see things through my eyes
You'd know you are a star the way you are
Petty people will stare
Just walk on by like you don't care
If you wanna rebel
Don't bow your head, be true to yourself
There are times when you will be afraid (don't be afraid)
But believe when I say, you're special in every way
Always okay to fly your free flag, it's cool the way you are
Don't have to try to be so perfect, come just the way you are
If you could see things through my eyes
You'd know you are a star
The way you are
I like you just the way you are
I like you just the way you are
The way you are
I like you just the way you are
I like you just the way you are
But don't you ever feel there's something wrong
'Cause when you're with me, you know that you belong
Always okay to fly your free flag, it's cool the way you are
Don't have to try to be so perfect, come just the way you are
If you could see things through my eyes
You'd know you are a star
The way you are (I like you just the way you are)
I like you just the way you are (the way you are)
I like you just the way
I like you just the way you are (the way you are)
I like you just the way you are (yeah)
I like you just the way you are (the way you are)
I like you just the way you are (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
