What you want from me
Say what you need from me
I got anything
Satisfaction guaranteed
So please be patient with me
I said music's gotta hold on me
I said please be patient with me
God's not through with me
Making me the woman you need me to be
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What you do for me
Is so damn refreshing
Is higher than a blade of sand
The sky is just a name, yeah
But that is why God sent you to me
To knock me right off of my feet
This is why God sent you to me
To be everything that I need
Making me the woman you need
Me to be
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What you want from me
Is it what you need from me
I got it baby
Satisfaction guaranteed
So please be patient with me
Said music's got a hold on me
I said please be patient with me
it's not you and me
Making me the woman you need me to be
Ooh, making me the woman you need me to be
Ooh, making me the woman you need me to be
Ooh, making me the woman you need to be
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
