Three thousand miles from home trying to say
That I will get there soon
Thirty days I walk down this way
Singing my madness to the moon
I met a cat on a tree
And it talked to me
About things we don't see
I asked it how do I know
Which is the right way to go
To get me home
And it said don't look for a reason, don't look for another way
anyway we'll get you home
You can't get lost if you don't know where you go
And anyway we'll get you home
Is the right way, they say, if you just go your way, oh
No, you aren't lost, just go and trust yourself
I felt so lost in life, felt like I'd never arrive
But my perspective was wrong
If I don't know where I'm going, I can't get lost
This way is my home
Is the right way, they say, if you just go your way
Oh, no you aren't lost, just go and trust yourself
And maybe tonight we're not getting home
And maybe I don't know where I wanna go
Maybe tonight we'll knock on the wrong door
And maybe tonight we'll sleep on the floor
But it's alright
I'm already home, I'm already home
This is right, I don't have to know
Where I wanna go,'cause this way is my home
