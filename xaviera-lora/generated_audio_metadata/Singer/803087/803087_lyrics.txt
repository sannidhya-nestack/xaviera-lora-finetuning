I can fly over the mountains
I can jump up to the moon
I can run the bottom of the oceans
And be part of the blue
You don't believe me
But it's true
I can play the music of angels
I can make a snowman in June
I can watch the world in slow motion
And stop the tide with a spoon
You don't believe me
But it's true
Never, never I said
I'll never leave again
Forever, forever I said
Forever is all I have
And forever is now
And I give it to you
You don't believe me
But it's true
I can see through any darkness
I can fight a thousand platoons
I can brew a magical potion
And show you the night sky at noon
And you don't believe me
But it's true
Never, never I said I'll never leave again
Forever, forever I said forever is all I have
And forever is now and I give it to you
And you don't believe me, but it's true
And forever is now
And I give it to you
You still don't believe me
But it's true
