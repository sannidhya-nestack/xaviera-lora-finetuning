So come on over and talk
Were you too scared to show me what you're working with?
I'll get bored and I'll walk
I got no tolerance for somebody playing games, games, games
Games, games, games
Games, games, games
I got no tolerance for somebody playing these games
So come on over and talk
Were you too scared to show me what you're working with?
I'll get bored and I'll walk
I got no tolerance for somebody playing these games, games, games, games, games, games, games, games, games
I got no tolerance for somebody playing these games
So come on over and talk
Are you too scared to show me where you're looking?
I'll get bored and I'll walk
I got no time, love is for somebody playing these games
So come on over and talk
Are you too scared to show me where you're looking?
I'll get bored and I'll walk
I got no tolerance for somebody playin' these games
So come on over and talk
If I get too scared to show me where you're lookin' at
I'll get bored and I'll walk
