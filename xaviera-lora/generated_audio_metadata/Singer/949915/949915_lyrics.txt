Walk with me
Down by the riverside
Walk with me
Feel there is something I cannot define
Whirling away deep in my mind
So walk with me down by the riverside
You lift me high but still I fear
I will fall
I will fall
Walk with me
We'll stare at the sky
Reflected by ripples that shimmer and shine
Walk with me
Down by the riverside
Inside you cannot decide
Drifting and shifting you change with the tide
I foolishly tried
All the time
To hold you down
You lift me high
Still laughing
I will fall
I will fall
I will fall
Laughing and joking and fooling around
Our footsteps softly stepping on ground
Making sweet sounds all around
So walk with me down by the riverside
You lift me high
Still I feel
I will fall
You lift me high
Still I fear
I will fall
I will fall
I will fall
