And you are a sly
And as wild hyenas in the night
Knocked on my mockery
Against your always charming smile
And it's not your style
To treat me with decency
Don't call me crazy
I'm maybe not so different from you
With your tongue inside my mouth
In your feet upon my shelf
You take everything you need
Though I'm empty like a glass
That's filled with nothing
That's filled with nothing
Well, after all
I am the one who's still to blame
The saving spell, straight from hell
It's kissing on my lips
With your tongue inside my mouth
And your feet upon my shins
You take everything you leave
Though I'm empty like a glass filled with my pills
Whenever you need, yeah
Love, love, love
With your tongue inside my mouth
And your feet upon my shoes
You take everything you need
Oh, I'm empty like a glass
And I'm waiting for a chance
To get out of golden chains
Never take everything I hold
I'm not as empty as filled with nothing
That's filled with nothing
That's filled with nothing
That's filled with nothing
