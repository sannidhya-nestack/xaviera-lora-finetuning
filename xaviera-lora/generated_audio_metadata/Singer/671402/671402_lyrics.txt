Don't judge me
After all you put me through
Just leave me be
I can hardly look at you
Since you broke me into
So don't judge me
Don't beg me
I'm too old to take anymore apologies
I don't want a thing from you
You've already done what you do
So don't beg me
A troubling wave is coming to you
From sticking the knife in my back and oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't spot me
Accept yourself is how you heal
But I'm not the only one you burned
It was the show you never learned
So don't spy on me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The trouble now I'm in is coming true
From thinking that I've paid my back
But it ain't coming from me
No, I'm pulling myself back up on my feet
You don't need a hug just to feel
Treating me like the dirt underneath your heels
Oh, oh, oh
A troubling wave is coming soon on you
It may wash the blood off your hands
Make you aware of yourself
No good night
Take out the knife in my hand
