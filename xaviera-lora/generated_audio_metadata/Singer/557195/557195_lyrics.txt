Never move your lips to say a word and that's alright
Everything I say left unheard and that's alright, yeah
You don't wonder what you're dreaming of at night
All these pictures in your mind
Impossible to see
Head on up
What's it like inside your world
Head on up
You know the truth about you girl
Head on up
Head on up
Head on up
Don't be afraid I'll be around
Speak here
I find it tough just to understand that's alright, yeah
And what's life mean without the chance to see the snow lifting down
And all alone inside your little world and that's alright, yeah
Don't you know that you'll always be
My little girl, my little girl
In a wonder cow you know that I'm around
When will you realize that
You'll never be alone, hey Laura
What's it like inside your world?
Get on up
Know the truth about you girl
Get on up
Get on up
Get on up
You'll never be alone
Hell aura
Lots of light inside your world
Hell aura
You know the truth about you girl
Hell aura
Hell aura
Hell aura
Oh, hell aura
What's it like inside your world?
Ain't alright
You know the truth about you girl
Ain't alright
Ain't alright
Ain't alright, oh
You'll never be alone
There'll never be a love song down there now
