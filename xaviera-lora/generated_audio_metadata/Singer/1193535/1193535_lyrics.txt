You call me in the morning and I smile on you my love
You follow me to my precious dream lady you're my love
I'm floating through tomorrow's sun yes
Will you come and stay by me
I know a place where we can both be higher
Dig in my love
Higher
Dig in my dreams of love all here at last
Dreams of love are now
Dreams of love are here at last
Try to understand
Dig in my love
Dig in my love
We walk upon the mountain green
You tell me
You care
I hold you close to my heart baby
I'll be there
I'm floating through tomorrow's sun yes
Will you come and stay by me
I know a place where we can both be higher
Dig in my love
Higher
Dig in my dreams of love are here at last
Dreams of love are now
Dreams of love are here at last
Try and understand
Dig in my love
Dig in my love
Higher
Dig in my love
Higher, dig it my love
The dream has, the dream has, the dream has begun
