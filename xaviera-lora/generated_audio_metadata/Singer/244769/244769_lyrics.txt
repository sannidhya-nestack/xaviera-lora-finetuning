With misty eyes he remembers now so old and frail
The great war to end all wars that could be no fail
He thinks of his wife and children amongst the falling men
And he did it when his son was only ten
The eagle lets out a scream
Cries out over another shattered dream
For soldiers who die for someone else's cause, a noble cause
He continues his story to his only boy and grandson
About future enemy guns over there in Vietnam
With praise to his God as his son dies
And his son's wife and child
No chance to say goodbye
Eagle lets out a scream
Cries out over another shattered dream
For soldiers who died
For someone else's cause
A noble cause
But the eagle lets out a scream
Tired of these shattered dreams
For the father and sons and all their little ones
It's for a noble call and for that they'll fall
For that they'll fall
Well his voice lowers now and his eyes die
Friends long gone and his son now dead
And his grandson's off to war now and he questions why
And he prays to his God as his grandson dies
And he thinks of his wife with no children
The eagle lets out a scream
Cries out over another shattered dream
Soldiers who die for someone else's cause and over cause
Oh, well, the eagle lets out a scream
Yeah, he's tired of all these shattered dreams
For the father and sons and all the little ones
It's an over call for that to fall, hmm
Great grandson that should have been
With a war to end all wars
And a grandchild just about ten
He'll play one more time
With his son just about ten
