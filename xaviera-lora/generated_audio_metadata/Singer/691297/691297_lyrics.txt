When I see you feeling so lost and empty
Wanna hold you close to me
Wipe those tears of fear from your eyes
Wishing you could see your beauty
It's clear I don't really want your hurting
The thought that tortures me inside
Wish I could take away your pain
But that request has been denied
And I'll stand by your side forever
I'll stand by your side'til you fall free
death tears me away from you
I'll never give up on you willingly
My love will always remain true
Give me your sorrow, pain and fear
I would gladly bear them all for you
With a soul as beautiful as yours
Does not deserve them and
Sympathy my heart bleeds too
Listen to me and please believe
You're beautiful as none can be
And I'll stand by your side forever
I'll stand by your side'til you're free
death takes me away from you
I'll never give up on you willingly
Be strong, Chappelle, and know that you are loved
Your cause could never be traced
Be strong, should help
Hold you close, comfort you
Promise it will be okay
Be strong, should fit
Then I'll stand by your side forever
I'll stand by your side till you're free
Till death takes me away from you
I'll never give up on you
I'll stand by your side forever
I'll stand by your side till you're free
Till death takes me away from you
I'll never give up on you
Willingly
No, I'll never give up on you
Willingly
Ooh, ooh
Be strong, she said
Mm, mm
