Lay my head to rest tonight
Count your blessings when you sleep
For when you wake your life is through
Love is all we have to keep
I wait
For the sun to rise
I wait for the sun
I follow you in my dreams tonight
I follow you into my dreams
Come now tidings bring some peace
If you're all alone nothing will go right
My dreams stand tall and bright you see
But I don't have the time to try
I wait for the sun to rise
I wait for the sun
I follow you in my dreams tonight
I follow you into my dreams
Hail, my soul bereft of love
Hail, my soulless tear does fall
Waiting for the sun to burn
But you won't be here till the day is gone
I will wait for the sun to rise
I wait for the sun
I follow you in my dreams tonight
I follow you into my dreams
Pray the Lord your soul should fight
But when I wake I'm all but lost
I'll fall asleep in my dreams tonight
And I'll fire away, ah
