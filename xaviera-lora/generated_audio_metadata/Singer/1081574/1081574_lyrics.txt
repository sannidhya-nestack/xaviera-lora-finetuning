Oh, I could try and move me
Yeah, move me
Like if I had no shoes
Show me
Oh I feel so alive, feel so alive
The dark will dwell in my eyes
Yeah I feel so alive, feel so alive
Won't we change the night
Oh I feel so alive, feel so alive
The dark will dwell in my eyes
Yeah I feel so alive, feel so alive
Won't we change the night
Before we chase the night
Oh, like a child you move me
Yeah, move me
Like a fire that's you
Show me
Oh I feel so alive, feel so alive
Dark around my eyes
Yeah I feel so alive, feel so alive
Won't we change the night
Oh I feel so alive, feel so alive
Dark around my eyes
Yeah I feel so alive, feel so alive
Won't we change the night
Oh, we chase the night
Oh, we chase the night
Oh, we chase the night
Oh, we chase the night
Oh, we chase the night
