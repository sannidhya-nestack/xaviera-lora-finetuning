It's Saturday morning, it's time to go
The birds are singing what I really should know
Sun is coming in my window pane
And they are saying that there may be rain
I see them living in harmony
They don't know much about material things like
Fancy cars or paper money
Gold watches or diamond rings I said
So Friday night let's take it slow
And we can go anywhere you'd like to go
We'll take our boat out to the bay
And we don't need no sails'cause the wind blows in our souls
And here I've been wondering
I'm wondering what this world's become into
Saturday morning, it's time to go
The birds are singing what I really should know
Sun is coming in my window pane
And they are saying that there may be rain
I see them living in harmony
They don't know much about material things like
Fancy cars or paper money
Gold watches or diamond rings I say
And I know that I can love you
But lately I'm drifting out into the blue
Saturday morning it's time to go
You are the best thing that I ever could know
Sun is coming in my window pane
And they are saying that there may be rain
I see them living in harmony
They don't know much about material things like
Fancy cars or paper money
Gold watches or diamond rings I said
