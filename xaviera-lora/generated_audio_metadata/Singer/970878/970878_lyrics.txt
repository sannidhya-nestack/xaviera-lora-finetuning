I take a little bit
And make a lot of it
I get a cool buzz
And you're the one cause
You make my heart jump zero to sixty
Revvin' my engine when tough times hit me
I'm usin' you, do what I gotta do
To get me through this hullabaloo
If I have to face the life every day, every time
Then you're my slingshot, do you mind me using you?
I'm not a castaway after a hurricane
My ship was sinking fast but then it long last
I picture you here
Just when I need it
Like Popeye's spinach
Nothing can beat it
I'm using you
Do what I gotta do
To get me through
This hullabaloo
If I have to face Goliath every day, every time
Then you're my slingshot, do you mind me using you?
Ooh, just the thought of you
Laughing, loving, living here I'm lucky I found you, I'm breathing in your atmosphere
I'm using you, I'm using you
Do what I gotta do to get me through
I have to face good life every day, every time
And you're my slingshot, do you mind me using you?
I'm using you
I'm using you, yeah
