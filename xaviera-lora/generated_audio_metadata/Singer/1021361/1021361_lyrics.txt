I can comfortably conclude that I'm the one for you
Say you feel the way, the way I do
Let's grab a glass of wine, it's truthful moment time
this feels like it's bigger than the moon
I wanna tell the world the news
That our one plus one makes two
I'm saying I love you
You and I, I love you
Baby, baby, baby, I
See your star and mine collide
Like a fire in the sky, I love you (I love you)
Yeah, you really need to know
How the freckles on your nose
Tickle all my heart like it's my toes
And I wonder'bout your eyes, how they catch me by surprise
But I live for the mystery, I suppose
I wanna tell the world the news
That our one plus one makes two
I'm saying I love you
You and I, I love you
Baby, baby, baby, I
See your star and mine collide
Like a fire in the sky
They say sweet true love is just a matter of time
You never know the first day of the rest of your life
But when I met you I just knew
I'd say I love you
You and I, I love you
I love you (I love you) you and I
I love you (I love you) baby, baby, baby
I see your star and mine collide
It's like a fire in the sky
I love you (I love you)
Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you
