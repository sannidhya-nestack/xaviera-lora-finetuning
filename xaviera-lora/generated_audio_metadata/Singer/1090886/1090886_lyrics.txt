I'm workin' this field, diggin' down deep
Plowin' through stones, pullin' up weeds
Row by row, time after time
I'm in awe of what I find
I find red roses blooming
Like a river of passion
A thorn bush bristling
Like an angry young man
A willow tree weeping
her love is dying
And sweet dreams opening to the light
It's a tie that binds
It's tough but it's real
And it's why
I'm working this field
I'm working this field
Coming to learn
That the same field
Gets blessed and burned
Floods and drought may not be fair
But they're part of what we share
We share red roses blooming like a river of passion
A thorn bush bristling like an angry young man
A willow tree weeping'cause her love is dying
And sweet dreams opening to the light
It's a tie that binds, it's tough but it's real
And it's why I'm working this field
We share joy in the summer when the sweet corn is growing
Fear in the winter when the bitter wind is blowing
And right in the middle there's an oak tree reaching up
Trying to connect to the love in us
It's a tie that binds
It's good and it's real
And it's why I'm working this field
Digging down deep
I'm working this field
Sour and sweet
I'm working this field
