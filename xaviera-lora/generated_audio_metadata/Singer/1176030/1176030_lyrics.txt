I took a long drive
Hoping you'd exit my mind
And I'd have the chance to feel fine
I awake from my sleep
Smothered in yesterday's grief
I'd say my room should be clean and it's covered in you
All of my problems, they all revolve around
I try to shake it, but I gotta face it, it's you
Every waking thought
Is training me to be the kind of girl I want
I think you'd want
I shape shift endlessly every day
I try a new face on
But you'll still be gone
I'm covered in you
All of my problems
They all revolve around you
I try drowning you out but you just keep swimming on through
So I'll take a long drive
Hopin' you'll exit my mind
And I'll get a chance to feel fine
