You said walk with me between two lines I'll follow you into the night
I'll wait for you in troubled times and keep the faith
And sleep with my eyes open just in case you fall
I want to catch the tear drops in my hands
So I can wipe them dry and lift you up to the sky
Between two lines
Between two minds
Between two lines
You said rainbows were not meant to be all blue
As if the rain washed all the colors out and left me
Swimming in the lake below my seat
The rocks were cold under my bare feet
As I waited for your return
And in my eyes, sun setting in the sky
In the sky
There's ripples in the water
Reflections in your eyes
The ripples in the water
Between two lines
You said wait for me'til darkness falls
I will come home, I will not leave you
Stranded in this foreign land
Unable to complete the path
To sanctuary of the mind
Complexion of your life
It keeps me wanting to be by your side
Until the day we reach the sky
Between two lines
Between two minds
Between two lines
You said walk with me between two lines I'll follow you into the night
And wait for you in troubled times and keep the faith
And sleep with my eyes open just in case you fall
I wanna catch the tear drops in my hands So I can wipe them dry and lift you up
