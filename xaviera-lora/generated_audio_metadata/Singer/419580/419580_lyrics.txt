The way the moon begins
The way the sun sinks in
The way the water falls
The way the wind it crawls
The way you fall asleep
The way you find a dream
The way you touch the air
The way you sit and stare
And I
Want you to smile at me when I pass you by
Eyes bright wide and looking up at the sky
Wait for something new about which to wonder why
And tell you
I love you until the end of time
The way the night speaks
The way the day it grieves
The way the trees blow
The way I know
The way you lose touch
The way you think so much
The way you see me
The way I see
And I want you to smile at me when I pass you by
Eyes bright white and looking up at the sky
Wait for something new
About which to wonder why and tell you I love you
Until the end of time
Until the end of time
Until the end of time
Until the end of time
