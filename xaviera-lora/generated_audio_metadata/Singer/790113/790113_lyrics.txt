Rise and fall and rise again
I feel like I'm carried by the wind
Behind the door I'll find your face
There's nothing else I wanna see
And there are times when I still wonder
What would I be if I was far from your sight
The world would disappear before my eyes
Try and fail and try again
I'll try until I feel no pain
There's no better place than this
And yet there's something I can't explain
And there are nights when I hear the thunder
It sounds like a giant fist upon our life
But tomorrow it will disappear before our eyes
Now everything around looks like a maze
I'm trying to find my own way out
Sometimes I feel I'm really lost inside
What should I say to you?
What could I say to you?
When my world fades away before my eyes
And there are days when I still wonder
But all I need is to see you smile
My pain just disappears before my eyes
