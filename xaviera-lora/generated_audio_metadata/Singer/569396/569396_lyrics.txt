Hello everybody, it's good to see you here
If I had a million dollars I'd buy you all a beer
But I ain't got no money, I'm poor as a plea
So I'll just pass the hat around and you can give to me
Give me all your money
Give me all your jewels
I'll take your house
I'll take your car
I'll take your guarded tools
Give me silver
Give me gold
Give me everything you own
I'll even take your telephone
If you give it to me now
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hello everybody
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hello everybody, so empty out your pockets, your wallets and handbags
Leave your pearls and diamond rings and don't expect them back
When we get together about this time next year
You can bet I won't et to buy you all a beer
Foreign and domestic
Draft or long neck
Regular and light
You know it would be sheer delight
To raise a glass or two with you tonight
Now don't that just bring a tear to your ear?
Hello everybody
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hello everybody
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hello everybody
