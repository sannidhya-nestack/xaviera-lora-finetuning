Postcards were all I ever got from you
In all your many trips around the world
Searching for your girl
Boat sales can only take you so far
'Til your sailing gets you lost at sea
Why don't you get lost with me
Get lost with me
I'll take you anywhere and everywhere you long to be
There's no rest for the waking
And the weary keep fighting
Looking for anything and everything
That can keep them from sinking
Anchors away, we all heard them singing
As they hoisted up the sails and left the shores they knew
Sing a song for the siren, she wants to see you
Wander, wander
Why don't you get lost with me
Get lost with me
I'll take you anywhere and everywhere you long to be
Why don't you get lost with me?
Get lost with me
I'll take you anywhere and everywhere you long to be
Sing a song for the siren
She wants to see you
Wonder, wonder
(MultiCom Jingle)
