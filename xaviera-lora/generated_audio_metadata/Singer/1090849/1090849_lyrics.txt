I was a fool to let you go
You loved me true, I know
I can't believe I wanted to be free
I was a fool to let you go
I was a fool to say goodbye
Now I'm the one who cries
I understand you found another man
I was a fool to say goodbye
Now I'm praying you'll come back to me
Through long winter nights without sleep
It's as if I had a debt I could pay with regret
I wish I could et
In place of your sweet tenderness
I have just one thing left
The bitter taste of my sad mistake
In place of your sweet tenderness
I was a fool, I was a fool
I was a fool to let you go
I was a fool
