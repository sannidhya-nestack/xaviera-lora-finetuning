A place in the sun
Some benches inside of the sea
Is all I'm asking
Believe and become
I think therefore I'll be
Always advancing
And what does that mean to me
Inspirational security
It can't be the same
When I see my love in silver coated frames
Pages of truth
Far from the beaches of my youth
And now I'll run on the spot
And make the best of my youth
Fear of the fight
The life in hope
The time to move
I really wanna live these dreams
I'm scared they live beyond their means
Hold up all you want
He who dares wish has already won
No more standing
Ridden by the hairs on my neck as I run
And what does that mean to me?
Celebrations of obscurity
A last state to call
Not a warning or a chance
To beg and crawl along by these
Just like a hurricane in a breeze
Now I run on the spot
And make the best of my fuse
The fear of the fight, the life in hope, the time to move
I really wanna live these dreams
I'm scared they live beyond their means
So how must it feel?
Driven only by one old wheel with no chances to catch
Spending all of your God given days in that part of your mind
With one finger pressed down on
Rewind on
Now I run on the spot
And make the best of my view
Fear of the fight
The life in hope
The time to move
I really am
Wanna live these dreams
But I'm scared they live beyond their means
Now I run on the spot
And make the best of my view
Fear of the fight, the life in hope, the time to move
I really wanna live these dreams
But I'm scared they live beyond their means
I run on the sparks
I run on the sparks
I run on the sparks
I don't know the stars
