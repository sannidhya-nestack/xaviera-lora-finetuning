She takes her time and he's bitter but he's fine about it
He says I see you and you're all that's true and I'm fine about it
And he's okay to go and she's okay she says I'm alright
Well he knows she's alright'cause he's always there for her
And he's alright about it
He's alright about it
He's fine about it
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and
He's been there all his life (he's been there all his life)
Dragging a ghost through the strife
Long gone battles on the run
Chasing down the day in the sun
Yeah, he walks the line and he's saddened by the truth of it
He says, "I see you, you're young and you're true and I like that"
Yeah, you're good to me'cause I am good to you
Yeah, you like me'cause I'm always there for you
And he's alright about it
He's alright about it
Yeah, he's fine about it
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know (and I know, and I know, and I know)
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know (and I know, and I know, and I know)
He's been there all his life (been there all his life)
Dragging a ghost through the strife
Long gone battles on the run
Chasing down the day in the sun
