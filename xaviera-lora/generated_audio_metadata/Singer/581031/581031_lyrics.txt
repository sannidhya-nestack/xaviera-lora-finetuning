It's 4am and I'm not tired
Something hit me and I'm inspired to change
You move around and people fade
You just wished that they had stayed the same
It's been like this for everyone
You ain't the first to wanna run away
But we can make it if we try
Look above, it's open sky for us
Things are changing all around
Things are changing all around
Things are changing all around
Things are changing all around
Things are changing all around
Things are changing all around
Things are changing all around
Things are changing all around
All day long we do our thing
I play guitar and you come sing like this
We make some dollars we make some cents
We move so fast and it's intense I know
So keep it mellow and keep it slow
Keep on rockin' enjoy the show tonight
We gotta work if we're gonna survive
But feed your soul to keep it alive always
Things are changing all around
Things are changing all around
Things are changing all around
Things are changing all around
Things are changing all around
Things are changing all around
Things are changing all around
Things are changing all around
Things are changing, changing
Things are changing, changing
As we walk, as we talk, as we roll on through these lives
Things are changing, changing
As we grow, as we jump out around, things are changing all right
Things are changing all around, things are changing
As we walk, as we talk, as we roll on through these lives
Things are changing all around, things are changing
