Leave your makeup at home babe
Don't you know we're alone babe
And I love your eyes the best when they're mine
Running away for a dirty little weekend
Dreaming of all the time that we can spend
We'll do it exactly as we please
Yes we can babe
Oh we can babe
We'll do exactly as we please
Oh, exactly as we please
Leave the phone off the hook, babe
Bring a smile and a book, babe
And simply doing nothing is the order of the day
Stop the clock and barricade the door now
Light a fire and put the world on pause now
We'll make'em break the rules just as we please
And yes we can babe
Oh we can babe
We'll do exactly as we please
Oh, exactly as we please
Oh, exactly as we please
Oh, exactly as we please
The outside world is full of trickery
So come on in, I'll show you trick or three
And you can make me laugh in your very own way
We'll be at peace together, soul to soul
Wake up late and nobody else will know
So come on universe, you can do your worst
Yes we can babe
Oh we can babe
We do exactly as we please
Oh exactly as we please
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Exactly as we please
Oh, exactly as the plea
