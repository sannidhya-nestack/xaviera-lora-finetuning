When you feel betrayed, I feel ignored
Makes no sense, can't take no more
Is there a chance, could we reconcile?
Sit back down, maybe talk a while
But you shake your head, turn away
Leave my heart in a sinking disarray
Thinking that you'd always come back running
Running back to, running back to me, oh no
Such a fool, such a, such a fool, fool
When I hear the fish, I look amiss
Tell me now, is this what's best?
If it's true, I'll turn around
Not before I stood my ground
A playful fool, girl, but not today
Bag still packed, won't you kindly step away
And she lets it always come back, well, yeah
Running back to, running back to me, but I'm out, no
And she calls me on the telephone
Had to say I'm very sorry
Can't come on so long
I keep the fish out of the goodness
I'll tell you now what I think's best
I played the fool, yeah but not today
Bag still packed, don't you kindly step away
Thinking that you'd always come back running
Running back to, running back to me, oh
Such a fool, such a fool
And you'd always come back running
Runnin' back to, runnin' back to me, oh no
Such a fool, such a, such a fool, oh
Such a, such a fool, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Such a, such a fool, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Such a, such a fool
