Hit the trail back in'25
Didn't know it would make it alive
Had to go where the money's good
Would've stayed if I could
All we knew out there somewhere
Our new land was waiting there
Across the plains and the great divide
Blow a kiss away we'll ride
No pain, no fear, no rain, no tears
No high, no low could stop us though
Hit the trail back in'25
Would take years before we arrive
Cross the peaks, the Indian lands
Through the streams, the burning sand
All we knew out there somewhere
A new land was waiting there
Across the plains a great divide
Blow a kiss away we ride
No pain, no fear
No rain, no tears
No high, no low
Could stop us though
All we knew out there somewhere
Our new land was waiting there
Across the plains, the great divide
Blow a kiss away we ride
No pain, no fear, no rain, no tears
No high, no low could stop us though
No rain, no tears, no pain, no fear
No high, no low could stop us though
