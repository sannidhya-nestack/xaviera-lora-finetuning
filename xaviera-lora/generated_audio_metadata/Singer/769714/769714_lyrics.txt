I'm talking about
Living in a crazy world
I'm shouting out loud
But no one hears a word
I'm walking in circles
Fallin' behind the game
I'm breakin' the rules
I'm payin' my dues
I'm thinkin'bout changin' my name
To a number that some young girl
Can't type on computer cards
I remember Lucky Seven
But I don't know who you are
I'm talking about doing something about it
I truly believe a little love is the answer
I found out freedom's the right to take chances
I'm talking about
Doing something about it
High on a hill
Decisions are made like candy
Lower than hell
Legions are born and branded
These heroes and zeros
They gather to seize the times
They're building up walls
They're taking it all
They're leaving their hearts behind
Like a martyr hugs a fire
I burn for a better way
Will the father of this child
Wait for judgment day?
I'm talkin' about doing something about it
I truly believe a little love is the answer
I found out freedom's the right to take chances
I'm talkin' about
I'm doing something about it
I'm doing something
I'm doing something
I'm doing something about it
Oh yeah yeah yeah
