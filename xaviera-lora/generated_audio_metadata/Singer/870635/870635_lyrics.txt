Skip to the back of the book, oh
Let's see how this story does end
I would jankly sort a half or two
And all that just ever after
Have you ever seen anything as mighty
As the oak tree
Well that's what did snap
And saw me long off the day high
Yeah it's true
Oh it's true
Yeah it's true
Oh it's true blue
It's true, yeah it's true
Ultra blue
All those chains so edge on blue
And this here's the valley of the two
And we're always on the margins
But I sing, la la la la
Johnny said pretty baby oh
Did you see that falling tree
Well darling that timber all fell for you and me
And Johnny pulled out a pocket knife and started
I'm carving on the bar
J .S. plus J .B
The design of a heart
Yeah it's true
Oh it's true
Yeah it's true
Ultra blue, it's true, yeah it's true
Ultra blue
All those Jameson and Johnny blue
And this here's the ballet of them two
And when the poet's on them they all just bust out singing
La la la, la la la, la la la
Oh la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la
Oh la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la
