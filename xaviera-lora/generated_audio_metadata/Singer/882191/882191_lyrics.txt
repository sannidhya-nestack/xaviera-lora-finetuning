It was only a glance, not even a chance
To sweetly remember the sweet romance
Where are you now, where have you gone?
I look in the mirror, I see the tattoo
It reminds me of you, of when we were young
When we were true
Now that we're done, now that we're through
Who would have known my love for you
Was only a dream
Now that we're done, now that we're through
Who would have known my love for you
Was only a dream
Your smile was the light in my day
How I lost myself in your deep dark gaze
Now you're gone, I've lost my way
Give me some time, give me the space
To write my songs and paint my face
To run in the sun and dance with the moon
Now that we're done, now that we're through
Who would have known my love for you
Was only a dream, only a dream
