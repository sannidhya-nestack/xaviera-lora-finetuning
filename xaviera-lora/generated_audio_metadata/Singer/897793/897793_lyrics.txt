Luck was never a friend of mine
I was grasping at straws to hide the hole inside
So I've never felt something like this
Floating through the days with bliss
From your early morning kiss
And knowing you'll come back for me
You make seventh heaven home to me
Haven't told you, keep you tangled in my daydreams
Never let you go, drowning in your love
Love beams make my heart long and foil
Seventh heaven that's home to me
All my close encounters said goodbye
You turned my head, blew my mind
Coloured me blind
When I took your hand, our hearts aligned
Our souls were mystified
For flying in endless time, it's all in all worthwhile
To be alive
You make seventh heaven home to me
I've been holdin' you, keep you tangled in my daydreams
Never let you go, drowning in your lovebeats
Make my heart longin' for you
Seventh heaven is home to me
You make seventh heaven home to me
Haven't told you, keep you tangled in my daydreams
Never let you go, drowning in your love means
Make my heart longing for your seventh heaven as home to me
Still I'm amazed by the touch of love
Coming back for more of me
You make seventh heaven home to me
Haven't told you keep you tangled in my daydreams
Never let you go, drowning in your love beams
Made my heart longing for your seventh heaven home to me
You make seventh heaven home to me
Haven't told you, keep you tangled in my daydreams
Haven't let you go, drowning in your love memes
Make my heart longing for your seventh heaven that's home to me
Seventh heaven that's home to me
