I met her way up in the hills
Party lights and dollar bills and lots of laughter
Spent all night in someone else's bed
Painted love a color red
But I still wanted him the morning after
They're the boys of Hollywood
Doesn't bad look oh so good?
They're the boys of Hollywood
Don't tell them that you love them
I had seen him on the movie screen
It was kinda nice to see him on the ground here
Underneath silk covers made believe that we were lovers
The scene went fine you know but I'm the better actor
They're the boys
They're the boys of Hollywood
Does it bad look oh so good?
They're the boys of Hollywood
Don't tell them that you love them
Then there was the one just passing through
When you know they have to leave you just move faster
Held him on the boulevard where everyone's a little scout
Helped to heal the wounds I'd gathered from the past year
Reversed the bad luck I was given by the cracked mirror
They're the boys of Hollywood
Doesn't that look oh so good
Like the boys of Hollywood
Don't tell them that you love them
He wasn't famous but he could have been
He had all the charm, the smile, enough disaster
Fell in love so many times that night, it was real once or twice
It's a dirty shame that really love can last a tear
They're the boys of Hollywood
Doesn't matter, oh so good
They're the boys of Hollywood
Don't tell them that you love them
Don't tell them, don't tell them
Don't tell them that you love them
