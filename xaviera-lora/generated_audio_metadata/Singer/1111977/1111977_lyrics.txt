So anyone, let me start here
Standing under a rain cloud
I was falling apart dear
Far from looking for what we found
I never thought of you that way
But something changed
You were standing right in front of me
When
You say my name, I feel like crying babe
Cause you've been on my page for a long time
For a long time
Twenty two, life's a party
Hangin' out'til the sun comes up
Moved in late February
Be a light love us then we grew up
I never thought of us that way but something changed
Saw the future right in front of me
When you say my name
I feel like crying babe
Cause you've been on my page for a long time
I'll hold on through the storm, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
No, I'll hold on
When you say my name
Feel like crying babe
Cause you've been on my page
You get the last line when I feel the rage
No I won't walk away
I need you on my page
You get the last line
You get the last line on my page
