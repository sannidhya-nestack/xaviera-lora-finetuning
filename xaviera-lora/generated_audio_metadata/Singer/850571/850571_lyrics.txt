Take me, carry me off to a safe place
Where nothing can happen
Show me, help me to muster a clean breath
So I can recapture
Where I imagined all the pageants you would lead
Graduation wedding bells
Dangerously I looked away
So sorry to miss you
Bring you flowers to light up your bedroom
The darkness remains
No chance of ever believing in something that I once believed in
February came and I was cold
Handing out your valentines
What's a man supposed to say?
Never fear, I am still watching for you here
With nothing to show for it
These years, there's no sense in hiding away dear
From back to September
Burning leaves ground
Capture what's clean in her soul
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
February came and I was cold
Hiding out your valentines
What's a man supposed to say?
Sunshine, it's time to come out of the rain
Dear, it was all I remember
These years, there's no sense in hiding away
Dear, from back to September
Never fear, I am still watching for you
We're nothing to show for it, these years
There's no sense in hiding away, dear
Go back to September
