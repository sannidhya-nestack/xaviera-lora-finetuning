Did you see the girl with the big brown eyes
Went to sleep last night with an empty smile
Did you see the boy with the dirty face
Scratching in the earth with his empty plate
It's a strange world
A strange world
There's an old lady in a worn out chair
With a silver hat, home alone again
A very young man is back on the street
Trying to find his way, trying to make his meet
In this strange world
It's a strange world
Are you hungry again for the hole you can't fill
Are you needy again are you insatiable
You've an open door but don't let no one in
Keep it all to yourself everything deep within
See the mother with baby in her arms
Trying to protect both from anymore harm
Old man in a box wants to keep him warm
Like the vermin fox no one ever knows
No one ever knows, oh
But are you hungry again for the hole you can't fill?
Are you needy again? Are you insatiable?
You've an open door but don't let no one in
Keep it all to yourself, everything deep within
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Are you hungry again for that hole you can't fill?
Are you needy again? Are you insatiable?
You've an open door but don't let no one in
Keep it all to yourself, everything deep within
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
