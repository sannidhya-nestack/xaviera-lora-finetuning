Early in the morning, I've got to get outside
Head up to the ocean, I've got to take that ride
Said I know you might be sad, I know you might be blue
But a life is yours to live, and a light may soon break through
Hey pretty mama, it's a beautiful day
And every time I see you coming'round that's what I will say
Hey pretty mama
It's a beautiful thing
And every time I see you coming'round that what I will say
Pour me some coffee, talk to me about love
Listen to the sweet songs little birds are speaking of
Welcome the rain, so the seeds may grow
Welcome the sun, smile and say hello
Hey pretty mama, it's a beautiful day
Every time I see you coming'round that's what I will say
Hey pretty mambo it's a beautiful day
Every time I see you coming'round that's what I will say
Some people talk, some people stare
But I want you to pull your vibrations into the air
Hey pretty mama, it's a beautiful day
Every time I see you coming round that's what I will say
Hey pretty mama, it's a beautiful day
Every time I see you coming'round that's what I will say
Hey hey pretty marble
It's a beautiful day
Every time I see you coming'round that's what I will say
Hey hey pretty marble
It's a beautiful day
Every time I see you coming'round that's what I will say
