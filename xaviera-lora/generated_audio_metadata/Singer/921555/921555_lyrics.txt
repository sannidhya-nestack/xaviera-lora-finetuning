Don't need to hear your negative opinions
Don't need to hear your negative line
I can't see nothing but the open road
I can't see nothing but the crossroad
The moon and these signs
The simple things we need to have
I never wanted your love so bad
But I can feel the bright blue sky
The morning sun gives a lonesome cry
Then she starts to fly down waiting for me
Don't need to hear your negative opinions
Don't need to hear your negative line
I can't see nothing but the open road
I can't see nothing but the crossroads, the moon and these signs
What's in your mind is what you'll become
Sometimes there really ain't no place to run
I'll have some wine, maybe a beer
I really like it in this time of year
I love the light and watching the stars
Don't need to hear your negative opinions
Don't need to hear your negative line
I can't see nothing but the open road
I can't see nothing but the crossroad, the moon and these signs
The simple things we need to have
I never wanted your love so bad
But I could feel the bright blue sky
And the morning sun gives a lonesome cry
Then she starts to light and waiting for me
Don't need to hear your negative opinions
Don't need to hear your negative line
I can't see nothing but the open road
I can't see nothing but the crossroad, the moon and these signs
