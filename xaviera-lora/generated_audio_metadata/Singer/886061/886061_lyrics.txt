Slow down, let me look into your town
Dead houses, middle class, they're falling down
Death
Bending bicycles on the lawn
Memories in a jar it's been so long
So long
Daylights are coming, daylights are coming
Daylights are coming, daylights are coming down
Coming from dollies to a mirror, home
Old sky hidden in the wall by picture
Home
I'm in a dream this is not the right place
All the right people but not the right faces
Oh, but daylight's a coming, daylight's a coming
Daylight's a coming, daylight's a coming down
And you're beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Just the way you are
And you're beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Just the way you are
