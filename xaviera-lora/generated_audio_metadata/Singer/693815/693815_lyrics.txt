When all I need is love and understanding
You say I'm everything you want me to be
And I don't need no telling or reminding
That you're the only friend that I'll ever need
And I don't know if God created angels
And I don't know if God created everything we see
I only know if God created angels
It's though He chose the best one
And saved you for me
You whisper to me softly at my shoulder
With tender words that sound so warm and sincere
That you're there to hold on to should I falter
In yours the sweetest voice that I'll ever hear
And I don't know if God created angels
And I don't know if God created everything we see
I only know if God created angels
It's though He chose the best one
And saved you for me
And with each day that passes you grow closer to my heart
Yes, more than ever
When all I need is love and understanding
You say I'm everything you want me to be
And I don't need no telling or reminding
That you're the only friend that I'll ever need
And I don't know if God created angels
And I don't know if God created everything we see
I only know if God created angels
It's though He chose the best one
And saved you for me
It's though He chose the best one
And saved you for me
