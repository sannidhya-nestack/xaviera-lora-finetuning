Faced only a few
Aces bathed in two
If only they knew
Draw, call and crack
And I'm not going back
Gonna make my move
Oh what could I do
When
Coffee highs in a suit (highs in a suit)
While I'm tangled up in you
Cold deck, singing too
Flush the soaks right through
And I'm not going back
Gonna make my move
Oh what could I do
Why would I choose
Holding or holding
Under the gun
Holding or holding
Under the gun
Two to one
I've fallen under
To the one I've come undone
To the one I've fallen under
To the one I lost and run
[Silence]
Smoke covers the room
Whiskey piano blues
Fade too soon
No time to choose
And I'm not going back
Gonna make my move
Oh what could I do?
Why would I choose?
Or holding under the ground
Faulted or holding under the ground
To the one I've fallen under
To the one I've come undone
To the one I've fallen under
To the one I lost and run
To the one I've fallen under
To the one I come undone
To the one I've fallen under
To the one I lost and run
