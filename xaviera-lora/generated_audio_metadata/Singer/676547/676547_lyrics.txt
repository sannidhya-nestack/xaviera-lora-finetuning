Why is it so wrong
That feels so right
Why is it you
I think of at night
I can't have you so why even fight
Your love is taken
You continue to invite
Like a fool I'm hooked
I need you so
You're everything I want but I feel so alone
I don't know how you feel but I feel it so strong
Brought myself head first though I know that it's wrong
Do I love you or need you? Don't even know
Can I sit back and watch?'Cause I can call you my love
Can I just let you walk out, let this go on
I will my love, I will be your pawn
Why do I want you, is it to fill a void
To fulfill a fantasy of a girl and a boy
There's a great place where this is going
Can I continue to live without knowing
These thoughts that are swirling throughout
I have no answers, am I going insane? You wanna see me?
My caution is in vain'cause I will see you
Maybe work through the pain
Do I love you or need you? Don't even know
Can I sit back and watch? (Since I can't call you my name)
Can I just let you walk out and let this go on?
I will, my love, I will be your pawn
I will be your pawn
I look in your eyes, lost in your stare
As you guide your hands to run through my hair
You bend down to kiss me, but your heart isn't there
Feel myself breaking
This just isn't fair
Like a fool I continue to give up the faith
These feelings are real so why do I feel disgraced
Should I feel so low, out of place
Now I know you found nothing, only wanted a taste
Like a fool I allow you to take me away
The way you touch me made me want you to stay
I feel like you do
Felt so afraid the moments of heaven felt like hell the same way
I knew you would leave me since you got your feelings
Leave my head spinning like Eden again
I knew you would leave me since you got your feelings
Leave my head spinning like Eden again
Was it worth the time
The headache that's real
How can you feel love
You know it's not real, was it worth the time?
It's the heartache that I dream
How can you feel love when you know it's not real?
