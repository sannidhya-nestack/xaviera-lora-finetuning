When I'm lonely you'll be there
If I'm broken you stay by my side
When I'm crying you dry my tears
Tell me everything everything's gonna be alright
When I feel I'm going nowhere you keep me strong
You're the one who's there to hold me when my hope is gone
Heaven knows I need you I need your love
Heaven knows it's more than enough
Heaven knows I need you, I need your love
It's too good to give up, you're too good to give up
When I want someone who'll listen
You always pick up the phone
When I'm too tired to try again
You come and take me right where I wanna go
When I feel like it's all for nothing and nobody knows
You're the one who comes running when it matters most
Heaven knows I need you, I need your love
Heaven knows it's more than enough
Heaven knows I need you, I need your love
It's too good to give up, you're too good to give up
Give up
If I'm wrong or if I'm right, you're still on my side
Love me if I win or lose
I don't wanna know where I would be
What I would do without you
Heaven knows I need you, I need your love
Heaven knows it's more than enough
Heaven knows I need you, I need your love
It's too good to give up, you're too good to give up
Heaven knows I need you, I need your love
Heaven knows it's more than enough
Heaven knows I need you, I need you now
It's too good to give up, you're too good to give up
When I'm lonely you'll be there
If I'm broken you stay by my side
When I'm crying you dry my tears
Tell me everything, everything's gonna be alright
