Beautiful boy, do you even see me here?
I wanna touch you, but you might disappear
And I'm stuck in a box I've put around myself
To shield what you could do
I've guarded my heart beyond belief, so why do I want you?
Oh, believe me, I've tried this a hundred times
And without fail, I always lose
I've been broken and stolen and stabbed in the back
But I still, I still want you
So come and be my hundred and one
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And I might have said the same thing at ninety-nine
And I hate myself for changing my mind
But love is a drug I'm addicted to
I'm high on the pain then I crash into you
But maybe just one more hit
'Cause you might be worth the risk
Oh believe me I've tried this a hundred times
And without fail I always lose
I've been broken and stolen and stabbed in the back
But I still, I still want you
So come
And be my hundred and one more time
Just one more chance that I've got to take
Just one more time'cause you may be my last mistake
Oh, believe me, I've tried this a hundred times
And without fail, I always lose
I've been broken and stolen and stabbed in the back
But I still, I still want you
Oh, believe me, I've tried this a hundred times
And without fail, I always lose
I've been broken and stolen and stabbed in the back
But I still, I still want you
So come, yeah come
And be my hundred and one
Yeah
Beautiful boy
