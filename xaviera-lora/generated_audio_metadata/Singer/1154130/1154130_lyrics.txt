I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
Sometimes I get caught up
Sweatin' over the smallest stuff
And I lose my head
Say things I can't take back
et who and where I'm at and how blessed I am
It's time for a change
No room to complain
Ain't no clouds in the sky
I'm kissing my worries goodbye
Good day to be thankful
A good day to be grateful
It's a good day to be glad minds in a place full
I got family, I got friends who'll be with me to the end
Ain't no reason to be moody, sad or hateful
A good day to be thankful
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Can't let what I have not
Overshadow what I've got
I've got enough
More reason to smile than ever
No doubt that I'll forever be rich in love
I'm letting go of what I can't control
And gonna be different me
Every day is gonna be a good day to be thankful
A good day to be grateful
It's a good day to be glad mind in a place for
I got family, I got friends who'll be with me to the end
Ain't no reason to be moody, sad or hateful
A good day to be thankful
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
There's no better time for my heart to unwind
Oh right here, right now, come and sing it with me loud
A good day to be thankful, a good day to be grateful
It's a good day to be glad my dinner plate's full
I got family, I got friends who'll be with me to the end
Ain't no reason to be moody, sad or hateful
A good day to be thankful, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (x2)
