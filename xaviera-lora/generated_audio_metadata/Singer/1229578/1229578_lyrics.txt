We put a plastic bag in the ocean
We burn our smoke screens into the sky
We turn a blind eye to the commotion
Our carbon footprints walk on for miles
Sorry I let you down
I don't wanna let you down
Sorry I let you down
I don't wanna let you down
You've got your head ten feet underwater
You've buried your head under the sand
And as our time gets shorter and shorter
Just take your last chance to understand
I don't wanna let you down
I'm sorry we've let you down
I don't wanna let you down
Sorry we've let you down
Are we so qualified?
To bring us suicide (to bring us suicide)
in a thousand years
When it's gone, when it's gone, when we're gone
There'll be diamond rain on wasteland
There'll be diamond rain on wasteland
Under this blue sky where we are breathing
The poison clouds we stow in the air
And can't you hear us kicking and screaming
Or is it that you don't even care
I don't wanna let you down
I'm sorry we've let you down
I don't wanna let you down
I'm sorry we've let you down
Are we so qualified
To bring us suicide
Cause in a thousand years
When it's gone
When it's gone
When we're gone
There'll be diamond rain on wasteland
I'll be slim
Are we so qualified
To bring us suicide
in a thousand years
When it's gone, when it's gone
When we're gone
There'll be diamond rain on wasteland
There'll be diamond
