Good God she's something else
I just can't control myself well
She makes me crazy on a regular basis well
And no she treats me right
I don't do nothing but fight well
I've got to make it right
I've got to make it right
But my pride is all put out
I can't speak to light or shower
I must be turning into something good, yes
New clothes, new disguise
So slightly plagiarized, well
But it's all lies, it's all lies
I'll be new
I may become a little closer to feeling you
I'll be the three to your one to
No matter what you do
Well, now, good God, she's something else
I just can't control myself well
She makes me crazy on a regular basis well
I know she treats me right
I don't do nothing but fight well
I've got to make it right
I've got to, I've got to fake it
