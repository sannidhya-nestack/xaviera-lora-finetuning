There is a story that is told
About a man who lost his soul
He traveled a very long way
Often moving night and day
His journey had its ups and downs
With more than its share of pain
He's been searching for someone
Hoping joy would come his way
He's been searching to find someone, someone
He's been searching all his life
To find you, find you
He's been searching all his life to find you
I've been living in the past
Hoping good times would return
I've been lost in my small world
Hoping someday I'd find you
All my love's been locked inside
Waiting for the light of day
All my love's been under wraps
It's been smoldering away
I thought the day would never come
When I would share life with someone
But now the day has arrived
I've never been more alive
You prescribed the cure for me
The tumblers fell at your command
You have brought joy and comfort to me, to me
You have brought joy and comfort to me
I've been locked inside my mind
Without the chance of parole
I've been waiting oh so long
Unable to move on
And now I'm suddenly set free
Locked away no more
And now I feel a sense of peace
Now that I share my life with you
Like a treasure chest of joy
Like fireworks up in the sky
No more dreaming of the past
You've inspired me beyond
You dialed in the secret code
The combination to my soul
You bring joy and comfort at last, at last
You bring joy and comfort at last
