I'm trapped inside routine
Like a loop in a movie scene
There is motion but I feel dead
Something's ticking inside my head
Sometimes I feel like I'm a fish inside a bowl
Limitations on display
But I'm growing wings that wanna fly away
I will be transformed
There's a light shining on my face
It's an image of you
You're my sidekick inside this wilderness
We'll help each other cut through
Sometimes I wondered if we'd ever find our way
And yet we always find some clues
Who left them here for us to find?
In our curious minds
Something's torn at the seams, I'm awake in this dream
There's no wall, just my fear
There's no death, just my tears
An old lair peels back, rusty hinges snap
I can find my way, help me find my way
Something's torn at the seams, I'm awake in this dream
There's no wall, just my fear
There's no death, just my tears
An old layer of heels back, rusted hinges snap
Sometimes I wondered if we'd ever find our way
And yet we always find some clues
Who left them here for us to find
In our curious minds
