I used to run across the sun, I used to think that I was alone
I was still chasing the wind, back to home and back again
I used to watch you play, I used to think that I could stay
I was thinking I was in
But life is not just what you win
It's a long way down
It's quite far down
It's a long way to the ground
If you don't breathe
Used to laugh at the rain, I used to think that I was sane
Rode the bus all the way through town, thought I'd see what's going around
Picking shapes out of the sky, wondering why the hell why
Listening to them say there will always be another day
It's a long way down
It's quite far down
You won't see the ground if you don't breathe
If you don't breathe
I used to be fine with the way
But love's got too many shades of grey
I was thinking I had you
But you can't tell life what to do
It's a long way down
Quite far down
You can't see the ground
If you don't breathe
It's a long way down
It's quite far down
You can't see the ground
If you don't breathe
If you don't breathe
If you don't breathe
If you don't breathe
