He keeps drowning me, drowning me
He keeps drowning me, drowning me under
He keeps drowning me, drowning me under
He keeps drowning me, drowning me under
He won't let me breathe, he won't let me sleep
Make me do all the things that he needs
Girls in this home
And he feels like he owns me
I'm struggling to get out of his grip
He's holding me tighter so that I won't slip through his hands
He makes me feel weak, weaker than I've ever been
He keeps using me, he won't use me again
Till he's done, till he's done
I'm struggling to get out of his grip
He's holding me tighter so that I won't slip
Through his hands
How many times and more
How many times and more
Not a hundred more
Not a hundred more
Will I allow?
It keeps drowning me, drowning me under
It keeps drowning me, drowning me under
And it keeps drowning (it keeps drowning)
I think I'm alone (it keeps drowning)
