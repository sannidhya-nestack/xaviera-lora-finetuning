When life is your feeling down
Don't blow the candles out
You know we're in the same boat
Oh we'll keep each other afloat
Cause I've been there and done that
I've walked down that path
There's nothing to fear
Cause together we'll heal
And I will always be near
Cause I've been there
When I feel like I'm stuck in a moat
I don't worry you'll throw me a rope
You'll help me to climb
Hand over hand we'll find a way to cope
Cause you've been there, done that
You've walked down that path
There's nothing to fear,'cause together we'll heal
And you will always be near,'cause you've been there
Throw me a lifeline, I'll throw you a lifeline
You know we're gonna be fine
you've been there, and I've done that
Come on and take my hand
'Cause we've been there, done that, we've been down that path
There's nothing to fear'cause together we'll heal and we will always be near
we've been there, done that, and we've been down that path
There's nothing to fear,'cause together we'll heal
And we will always be near,'cause we've been there
