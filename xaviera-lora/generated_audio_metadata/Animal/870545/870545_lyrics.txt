The first time I saw you standing there
So innocent and sweet
Little tiny paws and little tiny feet
We love pets, they're our best friend
We love pets, they are family
We love pets old and new
Lost and found they belong to you
Another year
So many wonderful memories
The times that we have spent together
You're a part of our family
We love pets, they're our best friends
We love pets, they are family
We love pets old and new
Lost and found they belong to you
So many years of joy with you by our side
Our home is whole again, it's a warm feeling inside with you
We love pets, they're our best friends
We love pets, they are family
We love pets, old and new
Lost and found, they belong to you
