Five little monkeys, swinging in a tree
Teasing Mr. Alligator, "Can't catch me"
Along comes Mr. Alligator, happy as can be
And snap! Four monkeys
Four little monkeys, swinging in a tree
Teasing Mr. Alligator, can't catch me
Along comes Mr. Alligator, happy as can be
And snap, three monkeys
Three little monkeys swinging in a tree
Teasing Mr. Alligator, "Can't catch me !"
Along comes Mr. Alligator, happy as can be
And snap! Two monkeys!
Two little monkeys, swinging in a tree
Tasing Mr. Alligator, can't catch me
Along comes Mr. Alligator, happy as can be
And wait, no, snap! One monkey
One little monkey swinging in a tree
Teasing Mr. Alligator, "Can't catch me !"
Along comes Mr. Alligator, happy as can be
And snap!
Off swam Mr. Alligator, as happy as can be
You see the choppers on that guy?
