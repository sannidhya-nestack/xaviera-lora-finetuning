If I were the sky, I'd paint you a sunset
One so beautiful you would never et
And if I were the sea, every wave you sail on
Would sing you a love song
If I were the moon, I'd shine in your eyes
As you looked in mine, I'd light up your night
If I were a star, I'd make one wish for you
That all your wishes would come true
But I'm only a man in love
Made of flesh and blood
And I can only give my heart
And pray that it's enough to prove my love for you is true
There's nothing I won't do so I'll keep trying and trying
there's no giving up in a man in love
If I were the wind, I'd whisper to your lips
And softer than a breeze, steal away your kiss
And if I were time, I'd spend forever with you
So I'd never have to miss you, but I'm only a man in love
Made of flesh and blood
And I can only give my heart
And pray that it's enough
To prove my love for you is true
There's nothing I won't do
So I'll keep trying and trying
there's no giving up
In a man in love
But I'm only a man in love
Made of flesh and blood
And I can only give my heart
And pray that it's enough
To prove my love for you is true
There's nothing I won't do
So I'll keep trying and trying
there's no giving up
You're a man in love
A man in love
