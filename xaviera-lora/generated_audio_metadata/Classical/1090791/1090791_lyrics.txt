Is the struggle and strife we find in this life really worth while after all?
I've been wishing today I could just run away
Out where the west winds blow
With someone like you, a pal good and true
I'd like to leave it all behind
And go and find some place that's new to God alone
Just a spot to call home
We'll find perfect peace where joys never cease
Out there beneath the kindly sky
We'll build a sweet little nest somewhere in the west
And let the rest of the world know of us
