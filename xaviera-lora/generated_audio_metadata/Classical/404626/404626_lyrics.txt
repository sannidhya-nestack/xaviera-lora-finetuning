He shall lead his flocks like a shepherd,
And he shall gather the lambs with his arm, with his arm.
He shall feed his flock like a shepherd
And he shall gather the lambs with his arm, with his arm
And carry them in his bosom
And gently lead those that are with you
And gently lead, and gently lead those that are with young
