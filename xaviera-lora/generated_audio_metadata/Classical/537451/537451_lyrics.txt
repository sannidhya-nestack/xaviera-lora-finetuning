'Tis the gift to be simple,'tis the gift to be free
the gift to come down where we ought to be
And when we find ourselves in the place just right
be in the valley of love and delight
'Tis the gift to be simple,'tis the gift to be free
the gift to come down where we ought to be
And when we find ourselves in the place just right
We'll be in the valley of love and delight
When true simplicity is gained
To bow and to bend we shan't be ashamed
To turn, turn will be our delight
Till by turning, turning we come round right
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
With true simplicity he's gained
To bow and to bend we shan't be ashamed
To turn, turn will be our delight
Till by turning, turning we come round, round
Light
