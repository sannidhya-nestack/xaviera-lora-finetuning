I'm coming home for Christmas
I'm coming home this year
See your face a love can't replace
I'm coming home this year
I'm coming home to see you my baby
It's Christmas time
I don't wanna hear your maybes
I'm coming home
The Christmas trees in sight
To be with you
you are my satellite
Coming home for Christmas
I'm coming home this year
See your face
A love I can't replace
I'm coming home this year
I'm coming home to see you my baby
It's Christmas time
I don't wanna hear your maybes
I'm coming home, the Christmas trees in sight
To be with you,'cause you are my satellite
I'm coming home for Christmas
I'm coming home this year
See your face a love can't replace
I'm coming home this year
I'm coming home for Christmas
I'm coming home this year
See your face
A love can't replace
I'm coming home this year
