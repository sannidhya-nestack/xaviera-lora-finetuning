In the silence of the night, the shadows dance in moonlight
There's a melody so sweet, whispering secrets we can't repeat
Caught in the web of time
Lost in a rhythm undefined
But searching for a sign
To break free and shine
I saw a dream
Did it but you died
I saw a dream
Saw from no make or die
Just take a jump out of sight
Hold me, catch it like a hundred miles
I am
Through the echoes of the fairfields
And the laughter through the tears
We're painting colors in the sky
Asking questions with no reply
Lost in the maze of life
Chasing dreams in the night
We're reaching for the light
To guide us through the fight
I said you, didn't want to die
I said you, suck a no make a die
She said you can't turn us outside
Home ain't kitchen if you don't have your eye, eye
सुन्दा से जीवान लोग
आई साँ क्यूं दिल को छुछाये
आई साँ क्यूं सापनों में खो जाये
जैसे एक अंजाना सासाया
हमें केंचले कहां क्यूं आये
In the whispers of the wind
And the stories that begin
We're painting colors in the sky
Asking questions with no reply
Lost in the maze of life
Chasing dreams in the night
We're reaching for the light
To guide us through the fire
I saw you, look what you've done
I saw you, but no we could die
Just a gunshot, not a sound sign
Hold me, can't shake, I'll hurt your heart
