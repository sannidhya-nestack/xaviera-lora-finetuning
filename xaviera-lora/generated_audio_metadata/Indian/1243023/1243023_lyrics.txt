Hip hop not dance, I love me goombla
We in my family, we gon' get down for all
I feel it rollin' disco ballet
Let's go crazy (hey)
Show no bullet, keep going for it
Do-be-do-be-do-be-do-be-do-be-do-be-do-be-do-be-do
I feel it, put your hands up high, yeah
Go with the vibe, keep going fly
Keep going fine, disco, disco
Let's roll, go (uh)
Roll to the rhythm, let it flow (uh)
Ballin' with beats with a soul (uh)
Disco time'cause you can't hold your own
Up in all it, put your hands up high, yeah
Roll up with the vibe, think of the vibe, think of the vibe
Disco, disco, let's roll, go
Roll through the rhythm, feel the flow
Ballin' with beats, feel the soul
Disco down like I should get on your world
