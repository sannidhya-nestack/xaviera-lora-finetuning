Oh, come on then, embrace the love
Na na na, let it begin, embrace the love
Oh, feel it within, embrace the love
Na na na, let the wind, embrace the love
Sunshine dancing on my windowsill
I'm ready now, ready for the thrill
Heart wide open, feelings overflow
Love's knocking, it's time to let it show
In a world filled with endless possibility
I'll take a chance, set my speed in free
Melodies playing
Guitar riff in my head
It's time to let go of it
It's time to let go of it
And that's the spirit, good chance, the chance
Set my spirit free
Melodies playing, guitar riff in my ear
It's time to let go of fear
We're not gonna know more
