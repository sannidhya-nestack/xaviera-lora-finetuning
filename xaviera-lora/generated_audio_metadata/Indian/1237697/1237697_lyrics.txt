Lost in your eyes, I can't deny
The way you make me feel it's so high
Heart beat racing, my mind's in a haze
Caught in a love, can't escape this craze
You got me helpless, don't even know why
Your touch is like fire, I can't deny
Every word you say it cuts so deep
I'm falling deeper into your spell so sweet
Dil diri nana
I'm under your control
Iska hai aasala
Mojpe hai chal moondhara
Dil diri nana
I'm helpless in this love
Tere pyaar mein nain mera kho gaya saara
You are you, but I need no photo
Iska hai yaad saar mujh pe hai janoon dara
Dil teri nada, I'm endless in this love
Nere pyarmen ne nera kogaya sara
Dil deri nana, I'm under your control
इसका है आसारा मुझे पे है जमून धारा
दिलते रे देना I'm helpless in this love
तेरे प्यार में ने मेरा कोगाया सारा
