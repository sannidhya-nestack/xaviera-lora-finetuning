Dance through the night in the moons soft light
Let your worries fade in the rhythm cascade
Rata per nache, chande nike sad
Sabi problem unjae, dana me kojae
Feel the beat in your soul
As you lose control I'm not sure
Let the music sway
All troubles away are nachos
Zindagi ke kama bahanko jaye
Tameko jaye
Sabi brav na brav ragaaye
With every step you take you join a wave, zacha
Dance away the blues
Feel each move you choose, zacha
With every step you take, new joy awakes our child
Dance away the blues, with each move you choose a child
With every step you take, new joy awakes our child
Dance away the blues, with each move you choose your child
With every step you take you join a wakeside job
Dance away the blues with each move you choose a job
With every step you take you join a wakeside job
Dance away the blues with each move you choose a job
