I'm home
I'm home
Floating in a sea of love
No one, no one, no one
Oh, how lovely you are, lovely now
Only here
Only love
Float in a sea of grace
No form, no face, no time, no place
Only spirit
Holy Grace
Floating in a sea of bliss
Ah
Love that, love this, no analysis
Only thee
Only this
Ah
Floating in a sea of waves
No he
No she
No you, no me
I'll leave you behind, I'll leave you behind
(I'm still here, I'm still here)
