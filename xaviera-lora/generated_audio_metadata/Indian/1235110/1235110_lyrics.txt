प्यार नू सा दीज़ बना विच किवे बना
How can I express love in a language?
आखियांच बस असी इजहार कर रहे हाँ
आखियांच बस असी इजहार कर रहे हाँ
We're just waiting with eyes broken hearted in front
We're just waiting with eyes broken hearted in front
Broken hearted youth in the streets of desolation
Searching for meaning in their lives
Searching for salvation
Fusion of languages, cultures in a nation
The Bangor beat unites in this generation
The Bangor beat unites in this generation
Streets of desolation
Youth lost in translation
In a world filled with frustration
Searching for liberation
We're just waiting with eyes
Broken hearted in front
We're just waiting with eyes
Broken hearted in front
