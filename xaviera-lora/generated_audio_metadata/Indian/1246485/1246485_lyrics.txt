Your body's outside, you're heavy, ain't walkin' out of line, gotta give you some time (hey)
Feelin' the rhythm, I just swear to the mind, you got the mind, press your grind, we dance until the daylight
Come on, clap your hands, stomp your feet, get up (woo)
Feel that beat, let it move you deep, don't stop (whoop)
We in the zone, makin' fuckin' stuff, that's right
You feel it inside, can't get enough
He's paradise, he's on that damn new floor (ah)
Get that new forehead to talk, let's go
Everybody shout it loud, let the sweetness flow (woo)
From the paradise to the show (woo)
