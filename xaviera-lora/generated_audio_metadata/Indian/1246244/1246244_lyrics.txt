Clouds and skies upon my mind
Floating high I leave behind
World below in a gentle haze
Dreamy moments soft embrace
Where do we go?
When we close our eyes
Flying through stars
In our moonlit skies
Where do we dream
When the world is still
Daydreams take hold and give me a thrill
Clouds like pillows lift me high
Twinkling lights start to sigh
Fantasies light up my night
Wishes born in golden light
And a hopeless soft embrace
Zain baind khaute hain toh hum kahaan jaate hain
Sitra ke daimiyaan varte hua hamaare chandani par aasmaan mein
Hum kahaan sapne dekhte hain
Jab duniya sukoon mein hoti hai
Din ke khayaan mujhe apne kabza mein lete hai
Aur mujhe ek utf dene lagte hai
Where do we go when we close our eyes?
Flying through stars in our moonlit skies
Where do we dream when the world is still?
Daydreams take hold and give me a thrill
Clouds like pillows lift me high
Twinkling lights start to sigh
Clouds like pillows lift me high
Twinkling lights start to sigh
Fantasies light up my night
Wishes born in golden light
Where do we go?
When we close our eyes
Flying through stars in our moonlit skies
Where do we dream when the world is still?
Daydream, stay cold and give me a thrill
