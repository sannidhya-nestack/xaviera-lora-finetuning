A double take, a second look
You caught my eye, that was all it took
When you turned around, oh you had such style
I was set on fire by your glorious smile
Oh my queen
Queen of the Nile under a red hot sun
The shifting sands, the tides that turn in Sirocco winds
The dragonfly hum under a red hot sun
The fragile wings of a first love burned
Like pages of a well-thumbed book
I can't put you down
You got me hooked from out of this chest
My heart was torn, swept off my feet by your desert storm
The sweetest thing that had ever been
Born under a red hot sun
The shifting sands, the tides that turn in Sirocco winds
The dragonfly hum under a red hot sun
The fragile wings of a first love bird
Where rivers meet, I picture this
I hold you close, the longest kiss
I'm tied to you, ain't no mistake connected by
A thread of fate under a red hot sun
The shifting sands, the tides that turn in Sirocco winds
The dragonfly hum under a red hot sun
The fragile wings of a first love burn
Under a red hot sun
The shifting sands, the tides that turn in Seraco winds
The dragonfly hum under a red hot sun
The fragile wings of a first love burn
