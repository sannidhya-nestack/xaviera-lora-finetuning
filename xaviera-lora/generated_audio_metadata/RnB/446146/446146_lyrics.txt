Saw you babe, frightened every day
See you trying, trying to find a better way
You know baby now, things gonna be alright
You just gotta hang on and fight the fight
Mmm, you gotta hang on when the fight is right
You know there's only one thing you can do
Let your love fly free
Let it roll like a superman dream
Let your love fly free, fly with me
Everyday I see the world running out of time
All the same old fear drives you out your mind
Baby baby now don't buy into this disease
Look inside yourself
Tell me what you see
Yeah look inside yourself
Put your soul at ease
Yeah, put your soul at ease
Just let your love fly free
Let it roll like a superman dream
Let your love fly free
Fly with me
Be your love, fly free
Let it roll like a superman dream
Let your love fly free
Just let it roll like a superman dream
Let your love fly free
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll
Let your love fly free
Let your love fly free (let it roll, let it roll, let it roll, let it roll)
Let your love fly free
