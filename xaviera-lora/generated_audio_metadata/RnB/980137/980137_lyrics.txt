Lil' something something, you know what I mean?
I wanna know you
It always starts off with that, right?
I wanna know you
Yeah, it always starts off with that
Feel the beat, feel the pack, like my heart, just like that, boom, bap, boom, boom, bap
She said she wanna know me, wanna love'em and a friend and a homie
And if you care, you stay there, stay patient baby show me
That you got screw pulls, dealt too long with the uncouth
I let my guard down, felt too long for the untruth
I wanna know you too
I'll do anything for you
I respect your boundaries
Your feelings plus I adore you (I wanna know you)
Just get to know my heart
I wanna know you (I wanna know you)
Just get to know my heart
Innocent, I can see it in your eyes
You don't trust my style of guy
Ran with the crew all in these streets
Right now baby it's bout you and me
Ask my team, I done changed
Wanna give you the his and hers
Jag in the range
Diamonds and pearls whatever you need
Whatever you want I wanna be in your league
M to the C to the S to the P to the I to the C to the E that's me
L to the O to the V to the E that equal Y O U plus me
You the MVP baby
Please take a chance on me baby
Can't retreat you gone see baby
You ain't never had a lover like me baby that's word
I'm hearing what you say (okay, so what's up then?)
You talk a good game (let me see, come on now, come on now)
But I don't need the fancy things or the diamond rings (what?)
Just get to know my heart (see, I'm trying to do that)
Do you really wanna see me bloom? (of course I do)
Like the pretty flowers that sprout in June (but of course)
It's mental, not material (okay)
It's not physical (okay)
Just get to know my heart
I wanna know you, I wanna know you
