Confession to make
Made some mistakes
My heart was only working
Hard time
You're so hard to take
I went insane
I needed to get out across the line
But who's to blame
he drove me wild (wild)
In the right kinda way
you drove me crazy (crazy)
On the wrong side of day
Not gonna lie (lie)
I really had to get away
What caused me to stray
I couldn't breathe
I told you that I needed to be free
Didn't know how to handle me
I was never yours
Don't think just cause we had the same keys
That you meant anything to me
Than who I used to be
he drove me wild (wild)
In the right kinda way
you drove me crazy (crazy)
On the wrong side of day
Not gonna lie (lie)
I really had to get away
What caused me to stray?
Jealousy, it wasn't for me
Screaming calls and immaturity
Your childish gaze and foolish ways
I doubt you ever, I doubt you ever
I doubt you, I doubt you
Ever change
you drove me wild (wild)
In the right kinda way
you drove me crazy (crazy)
On the wrong side of day
Not gonna lie (lie)
I really had to get away
Get away
you drove me wild
In the right kind of way,'cause you drove me crazy, on the wrong Saturday, not gonna lie, I really had to get away
So what caused you to stay
And I strayed
Cause you took my breath away
But not in that good kind of way
