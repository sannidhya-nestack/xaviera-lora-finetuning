Had an odd dream about you, sweetened out of the blue
Surprised to see your face, left me in a strange new place
Woke up so whole and free
I could feel your love for me
Wish I kept you in my sight
Fill me up to my tall height
Oh, little do you know
I still feel the same, so
Come back to me, where can you be?
Take a flight to LA
Come back and see how we're meant to be
Don't live so far away
Think about how we first met
For me it's hard to et
Protected me with words and wit
Impressed me a little bit
Remember when we parted ways
Left me in a hurtful haze
Stared across a crowded street
What's full and better sweet
Oh little do you know
You still feel the same, so
Come back to me, where can you be?
Take a flight to LA
Come back and see how we're meant to be
Don't live so far away
Just come back to me, where can you be?
Take a flight to LA
Come back and see how we're meant to be
Don't live so far away
Come back to me baby (come back to me)
Come back to me (come back to me)
Come back to me (come back to me)
Come back to me, come back to me
Now you're in a southern state we haven't talked of late
Singing just to let you know that I'm yours if you'll have me some
Come back to me, where can you be?
Take a flight to L .A.
Come back and see how we're meant to be
Don't live so far away
Just come back to me, where can you be?
Take a flight to L .A.
Come back and see how we're meant to be
Don't live so far away (come back to me)
Come back to me, baby (come back to me)
Come back to me, come back to me
You know you want to, you know you need to
Come back to me, come back to me
