Everybody said they know about the den
You take a minute to savour then you walk right in
People crawling all over each other just to know
Is it just a joint that everybody got to go along
So sad, huh, you had to miss this
We got the time if you got the business
So just you leave it up to me now people
Just you leave it up to me
Well at some kinda time or some kinda night
Somewhere a lot of people startin' to feelin' alright
Itchin' for what is missin' out on everyday life
Come on inside we'll make you see it's all nice
When I drop down once show me if you can
if you can't then we got to do it all over again
Yes just ya leave it up to me now baby
Just ya leave it up to me
Everybody said they know about the dare
You take a minute to say well then you walk right in
There's people crawling all over each other just to know
Is it just a joint that everybody got to go along
So sad, you had to miss this
We got the time if you got the business well
Just you leave it up to me now people
Just you leave it up to me
