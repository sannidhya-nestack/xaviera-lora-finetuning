All these boys want my company
But they ain't right cause you the one for me
I hear them telling me they love me
But they ain't right cause you the one
You the only one
All these boys want my company
But they ain't right cause you the one for me
I hear them telling me they love me
But they didn't like cause you the one, you the only one
They love the way I look in these jeans
They wanna take me away, sweep me off my feet
Tryna treat me right, give that love that I need
But what you see in your eyes ain't always what it's
I got a lot of ones that can't compete
Hitting my phone up
While I'm trying to get seen
You make the picture in the puzzle go clean
So listen up while I try to come clean
Go and look at what you've gone done done
Got me singing on this world song oh yeah
Oh maybe I can be the one
Baby I'm still young
And all these boys looking good
Let's look some
It's gotta be my way
I can't help it
These boys wanna play
I'm so selfish
Cause I want the entree
And the side dish
But you're the only one, so check it
Gotta be real with you, I think you're beautiful
Let's stack this bed to where the ceiling is to
Top down, now the sky's where the ceiling should be
And things have never been clearer to me
To me
All these boys, want my company
They ain't right, you the one for me
I hear'em telling me they love me
But they ain't right'cause you the one, you the only one
So many choices for me to make up right now
My mind's all twisted and upside down
When you're beside me I'm bout tied up
Catching bad sized feelings, you want life sized love
Oh, you might not be the man that I deserve
Oh, I know I do a lot of things that might hurt
If you promise to be mine then I'm all yours
You might not feel it all the time, take that as my word
Never mind what's right, I want you by my left side, my body
Just decide of what's next, you a star in the flesh
Don't need a follow request, got my mind made up
Installed my heart from my chest to wall
You complete my words without ever trying
Always say you got me, you ain't never lyin'
I'm already searchin', you were never hidin'
If I could be your one, then you'd be my one
All these boys want my company
They ain't right, you the one for me
I hear'em tellin' me they love me
But they ain't right'cause you the one, you the only one
