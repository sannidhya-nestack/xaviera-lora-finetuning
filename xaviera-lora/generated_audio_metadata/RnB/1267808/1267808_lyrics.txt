Look at yourself, sitting in your easy chair
Dreams on a shelf, should be dancing in the velvet air
But feeling strong for some satisfaction
Nothing wrong'bout a love reaction
Time is ripe to give our love some traction
Wild is the night
Wild is the night
Babe you and I
Are creatures of the night
Some will wanna blame it
Some will try to tame it
But there's no way to ever contain it
Give up the fight
Wild is the night
Here in the land where the leaves change but never fall
We take a stand, no time left to stall
You can taste some water on the ocean spray
When the chorus hits you like a giant wave
Let the music play like there's no yesterday
Wild is the night, wild is the night
Babe you and I are creatures of the night
Some will want to blame it
Some will try to tame it
But there's no way to ever contain it
Give up the fight
Wild is the night
Wild is the night
Babe you and I
Are creatures of the night
Once you've tried it, there's no way to hide it
The best you can do is try to ride it
Give up the fight
Wild is the night
Wild is the night
Wild is the night
