She's breezy and to love her is so easy
Still not quite sure how she sees me
But I would try to make her believe
She soothes me (soothes me)
When I'm with her how she moves me (moves me)
In her world I just lose me
And I never wanna leave
I will be her idol
If she will be my queen
No use to resist when love seems right
Please ive me madam
But this garden I can't leave
The apple is delicious take a bite
She's dreamy (dreamy)
I'm sure her tender kiss could free me (free me)
I'd be ecstatic just to see me (see me)
In the reflection of her eyes (in the reflection of her eyes)
She's breezy (breezy)
And to love her is so easy (easy)
Still not quite sure how she sees me (don't know how she sees me)
But I will try to make her believe (make her believe)
I will be her idol
If she will be my queen
No use to resist when love seems right
Please ive me madam
But this garden I can't leave
The apple is delicious take a bite
