Oh, yeah, yeah, oh
Every day and every night
I think about you all the time
Nothing seems to clear my head of you, baby
I just wanna kiss your lips
And think about it, keep secrets
About the things we're gonna do all night, baby
Let me see you shake your body (shake it)
Let me see you shake your body down (shake it)
Let me see you move your body (come on)
Let me move your body (let me see you move your body)
Fish out my mouth now
I just can't stop thinking about you
Love will never do without you
Nothing's on my mind tonight but you baby (my mind nothing but you baby)
Thinking'bout you drives me crazy
I just wanna touch you baby
Nothing's on my mind tonight but you baby (nothing but you baby)
Oh oh oh oh
Nothing but you, babe (come on, come on)
It ain't my style to be up front
But this is getting serious
I'm waiting for your love to send me your baby
The way you move is scandalous
The way you look I can't resist
So come on over here and put it on me, baby
You see you shake your body (shake your body)
You see you shake your body (shake it on down)
You see you shake your body (shake it, move it)
You see you shake your body (come on and move your body down)
I just can't stop thinking about you
Love will never do without you
Nothing's on my mind tonight but you baby (but you baby)
Thinking'bout you drives me crazy (drives me crazy)
I just wanna touch you baby (touch you)
Look into my eyes and let me love you baby (baby)
Come on, come on
I see you shake your body (shake your body)
I see you shake your body down (shake your body down)
I see you move your body (shake your body)
I see you move your body down (move your body down)
I see you shake your body
You see you shake it back down (you see you shake it back down)
You see you move it back down (you see you move it back down)
You see you shake it back down
I just can't stop thinking about you
(thinking about you) love without you, without you
Nothing's on my mind tonight but you babe
Thinking'bout you drives me crazy
I just wanna touch you baby
Nothing's on my mind tonight but you, babe
I just can't stop thinking'bout you
Love will never change without you
Nothing's on my mind tonight but you
Nothing's on my mind but you (thinking'bout you drives me crazy)
Thinking of me and you (I just wanna shoot you baby)
Come on (nothing's on my mind tonight but you, baby)
Nothing but you, baby (I just can't stop thinking about you)
Thinking in my mind (I would never shoot without you)
Baby (nothing's on my mind tonight but you, baby)
Nothing but you, baby
Thinking'bout you, just in case (thinking, thinking)
I just wanna shake you baby (can't stop thinking about you)
There's nothing on my mind tonight (what you doing to me)
Just wanna shake that shit (nothing but you tonight, baby)
I put it in the air, you know how I like it
