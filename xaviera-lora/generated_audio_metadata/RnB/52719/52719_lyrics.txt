Girl, I need you to make up your mind
My days are getting longer, waiting for the night
If you feel that thing inside
Don't keep it to yourself, baby don't let it hide
You near me and the way you're breathing
Your heart, your heart is saying
With me just take a chance with me
You can be who you are
You can be what you wanna be
If you just take a chance with me
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Sometimes, sometimes when you're feeling down
I'm just a call away if you need me now
Baby, don't give up so easily
I learned you're just in love
And that you're giving in
Tell me I can feel you thinking
Caress me and you will see
Just take a chance with me
You can be who you are
You can be what you wanna be
If you just take a chance with me
You don't have to look around
Baby if you please
And I think of you
I'll tell you what I feel
This time in my life
Only you can make me right
I'll give you my heart
If you need another beat
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you all
Take a chance with me (Take a chance with me)
(Be my love, woo)
Take a chance with me (Be my love, woo)
(Be my love, be my love)
Take a chance with me
Take a chance on me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Take a chance
