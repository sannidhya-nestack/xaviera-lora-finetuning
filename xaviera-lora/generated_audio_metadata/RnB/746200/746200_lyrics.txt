Uh-uh, don't turn off that cellphone, babe
Nah, okay, just don't take out that battery
I see you in your bed, wakey-wakey, sleepyhead
Don't wanna be late, it's time to go catch the bus
Every day, 7 .30, bright and early
Pick your poison toothpaste, having that fresh breath is a must
Oops, you almost missed it
Getting that ritual radiation from that cell phone
Man I love that cell phone
Please just keep that thing on
Don't worry bout what I know
Scrolling through your iPhone
Just know we never sleep homes
We all seen
We'll watch you
I just wanna keep you safe
I'll find you
We know the truth
I'm before you, it's a little too much, I own you
I'm trying to keep you from the bad, be seeing you, see you, we ain't bad
If you take a trip this year because your family wants to see ya
Then I'm snooping through your luggage cause that's standard procedure
Drones creeping through the night sky while you fly by
I'm peeping you with my eyes
My third eye, catch up cause your thoughts they flash by
So now your credits looking meh
You could definitely spend more wages
I can give you what you need
Go on ahead and write your wish list
I'll get rid of your fees
And subsidize your interest
Let's invade the foreign countries
Fight for all, I mean freedom
Yeah, I mean, if we change it though, all of them terrorists and all them bad people, they gonna get y'all, you know, so we just trying to keep you safe, we make sure that you safe from them, you know what I mean?
We got our spies out, you better keep an eye out (no, no, it's not us, it's them)
We got our spies out, you better keep an eye out (you understand?)
So just trust in us, it's a beautiful country, we're here for you, yes you
Just obey, obey
And everything will be just fine
Trust us, there's no harm in that, right?
I mean, it can be a little creepy, right?
Just, you can see everything you're looking at on your computer
Your phone, but it's all for the greater good
