I'm feeling like a star, feeling like a god
I'm feeling like I was ten feet from where you are
Feeling like I just can't be like no one else
Cause I do it for my mother, for my motherfucking self
I don't need nobody's help, then I'm coming for the belt
Lights, camera and the phone, they can try to tell me no
If they do, I let'em go, got no time to play it slow
If they try to come back, then I gotta send'em home
This is the moment, the moment of my life
I'm feeling like a boss, can't nobody tell me nothin'
Yeah they runnin', yeah they runnin' when I'm comin'
I'm feeling like a boss, and I'm comin' for the top
And I'm never gonna stop'til I get it
I'm feeling like a sexy independent, always keep it winnin'
I'm the boss, I'm the boss, you can call me Rockefella'cause I, I, I feel like
The world is mine, I call the strikes like an umpire
I don't need nobody's help and I'm coming for the belt, lights, camera and the throne
They can try to tell me no, you can try to break me down, you can try to make me fall
But I do not mess around and I'm coming for it all
This is the moment, the moment of my life
I'm feeling like a boss
Can't nobody tell me nothing
Yeah they running, yeah they running when I come in
I'm feeling like a boss
And I'm coming for the top
And I'm never gonna stop'til I get it
I'm feeling like a boss
Can't nobody tell me nothing
Yeah they running, yeah they running when I come in
I'm feeling like a boss
And I'm coming for the top
And I'm never gonna stop'til I get it
This is the moment, the moment
Of my life
This is the moment, the moment
Of my life
I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling like a boss
Boss
Boss
I'm feeling like a boss
Can't nobody tell me nothing
Yeah they running
Yeah they running
We're not coming
I'm feeling like a boss
And I'm coming for the top
And I'm never gonna stop'til I get it
I'm feeling like a boss
Can't nobody tell me nothing
Yeah they running
Yeah they running
We're not coming
I'm feeling like a boss
And I'm coming for the top
And I'm never gonna stop'til I get it
I'm feeling like a boss
I'm feeling like a boss
I'm feeling like a boss
