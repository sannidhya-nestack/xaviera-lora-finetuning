I know girl
I can see it in your face
I know girl
'Cause I share that same quiet rage
Yeah, I know, yeah, girl
It's always been this way
Yeah, I know, girl, yeah, I know
The time is up, it has got to change
We are in power
We'll just get louder
Until the heroes roar (until the heroes roar)
We are in power
We will not cower
So let's just face the world
Every time you were the victim but you still got blamed
Every time you looked in the mirror and you fell and you felt ashamed
For the things you buried deep inside and you'll probably take to your grave
Every time someone crossed the line
And tried to make you think that it was okay
Well it never was
For every time you just was betrayed
Oh yeah
And for that check you get
Oh yeah that check you get with worthless pay
You'll still get up every day anyway
And you'll deal with the pain
Forced to play their game
The sacrifices you make (I know, I know)
the bills had to get paid
The kids gotta get rest
We are in power
We'll just get louder
Until the heroes rise (Until the heroes rise)
We are in power
We will not care where
So watch us change the world
Come on girls, we are in power
We'll just get louder
Until the heroes roar (until the heroes roar)
We are in power
We will not care where
So watch us change this world
I know you can feel this
And together we are even stronger
We can make it better for ourselves and others
And there'll come a day they won't have to say
No, never have to say the names for us
We'll just get louder until I hear us
We are in power
We will not care who we are
So let's just change the way
Change the way
We are in power
We'll just get louder
Until they hear us roar
We are in power
We will not go away
So I just changed the world (ooh, come on girls)
So I just changed the world (so I just changed the world)
Yeah, I just changed the world (so I just changed the world)
So I just changed the world (so I just changed the world)
So I just changed the world
