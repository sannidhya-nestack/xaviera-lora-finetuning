You'll turn that bass up for me, right?
Smooth it out some
Oh
One, two, three to the four
Twenty minutes'til I gotta walk out the door
Should I wear jeans or a dress?
The club owner said dress to impress
I gotta make sure I'm lookin' the hottest
Quickly spray on seductive goddess
Grab my keys and blackberry
Make sure the money clip holds tightly
Cruisin' down by thirty-five
In my oldie but a goodie
Tripped out ride
It ain't a Benz or a Bentley
But I get from point A to point B
Finally
I arrive at the party scene
Now the time has come for me to do my thing
Guessing the VIP treatment
It's my night
I don't have to wait in line
I may not be
Ballin' out of control
But this is how I roll
Five to six, seven to the eight
Security is walking me into the place
I got everyone looking at me
Thinking I'm a celebrity
Feels really good to be able
To get that reserve tag on my table
Order me my favorite drink
The man at the bar gave me a wink
The DJ starts playing my song
And I can't help but to sing along
People looking at me like I've lost my mind
But I'm just here to have a good time
Finally I don't have to worry about nothing
Back above me as I start to do my thing
Getting the VIP treatment, kick back, relax
Sipping on my coke and jack
I may not be ballin' out of control
But this is how I roll
Oh, oh, oh, mm-mm, yeah
I'm gonna let go of all the stress in my life
So excuse me while I do my thing
Getting the VIP treatment kick back, relax
Sipping on my coke and jack
I may not be falling out of control
This is how I roll
Get up on your feet
Go ahead and shout
Go ahead and walk it out for me now
Sing it for me
