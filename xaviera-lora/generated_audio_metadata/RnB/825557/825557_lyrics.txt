Mmm, days gone by
Mmm, days gone by
Take me back way down the line
When the flowers bloomed in time
With our hearts and minds
Take me back to the last show
Take me back to hear the roar
Not so loud no more
Ooh, days go by, days go by, days go by
Days go by
And I think of you
Ooh, days go by, days go by, days go by
These days go by
And I think of you
I wanna reach over the edge
Feel the wind whip'round my head
And see what's down there
I'm gonna stretch my fingers out
And see what's above the clouds
Find a better now
Ooh, days go by, days go by, days go by
Days go by and I think of you
Ooh, days go by, days go by, days go by
And these days go by I still think of you
We'll never be the same
Just as the nightingale
Flies out and sees the day
We'll never be the same
I lost, I lost your name
Inside the hurricane
It blew you far away
But you'll be back some days
And days gone by
Some days
In days gone by
In days gone by
There was a colour in my head I never saw before
I knew that you could see it too but it's impossible
There was a feeling in my chest that I could not explain
But I could see from your smile that you felt the same
In days gone by
In days gone by
