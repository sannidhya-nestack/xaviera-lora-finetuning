Every time I walk by I can hear the whispers
I knew something was up this morning when I kissed her
Before I left the room it all went dark
I heard the voice of doom she said
We're better off apart
She gave me the pink slip
And sealed it with a false kiss
She gave me the pink slip
Without that two weeks of notice
Oh she gave me the short end of the stick
And it's time to move on
Yes it is I got the pink slip
Everybody heard the news long before I did
Guess I was still believing that we were the perfect fit
I am the fool
I couldn't connect the dots
Now I'm shredding her love notes
And she's changing all the locks
She gave me the pink slip
And said it were the false kiss
She gave me the pink slip
Without the two weeks notice
Oh she gave me the short end of the stick
And it's time to move on
Yes it is I got the pink slip
Oh she gave me the pink slip
Lord I had the pink slip
She gave me the pink slip
You know, you know, you know I done got the pink slip, hey
She gave me the pink slip (hey)
And sealed it with a false kiss (ah)
She gave me the pink slip (Lord, she gave me the pink slip)
Without for two weeks notice
She gave me the short end of the stick
And it's time to move on, yes it is
I got the pink slip (Lord, I got the pink slip)
She gave me the pink slip, told me it would all get better
She gave me the pink slip, without a reference letter
She gave me the pink slip, yeah yeah yeah
She gave me the pink slip
Lord, you know, you know, she gave me the thing, flame
