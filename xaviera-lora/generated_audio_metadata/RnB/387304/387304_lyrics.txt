Freedom, freedom can't be bought
Freedom, freedom can't be touched
It's inside of every woman
It's inside of every man who wants
To live his life in peace and harmony
Freedom
It's all in the blood yeah
A freedom's hard to gain
You can lose freedom through fighting just the same
In the roots of every nation with the blood for confrontation
People pay the price
Where, where, where, where, where, where, where
Freedom
Hidden in my soul
Freedom
I'm all's discreet at the goal
From within I try to reach her
Like a mad obsessive creature
Freedom
Gotta live your life
It's all in your fucking head
Freedom, give me, give me
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, live your life
Freedom, mmm
Freedom, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Freedom, come and live your life
