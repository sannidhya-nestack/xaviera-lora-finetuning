I just need happiness, oh yeah yeah
I don't need forty acres and a mule
You and me would be cool I just want happiness
I'd walk a million miles just to see you smile for me
I just need happiness
I'm destined for greatness
I know I'ma make it one day
And you can't bring me down
I know my faith won't fail me now
I don't feel like nothing here could stop me
Maybe you but not me
I'm swimming hope I'm not pulled under
Feel like I'm surrounded by thunder
Like I'm lost and there's no way home
How will I make it on my own
And I don't need everything in the world
I just need a roof over my head and a pretty girl
I just need happiness, oh yeah yeah
I don't need forty acres and a mule
You and me would be cool, I just want happiness
I'd walk a million miles just to see you smile for me
I just need happiness (I could do it, you're telling me I could do it)
I done came from the bottom, I'm telling you I been through it, knew it always would change
Success all on my brain, now look at me, I'm the main, the ladies they know my name
Look how far I done came, it's more than fortune than fame
Competition is gone, look how I still remain
And I stay true to me, that's the way to be legit
It was hard I will admit, but at least I didn't quit
I got up, had faith, and took risks
Told the people at the top, I'll be there in a bit
And everybody that I started with, I'm still with
I did it all for my happiness
Now grab me this and let me do my thing
Like pretty ladies sing
Everything I say when I'm on this stage
Say let me give you my heart in a diamond ring
And we can talk about all the finer things, baby
Oh yeah yeah
I don't need forty acres and a mule
You and me would be cool I just want happiness
I'd walk a million miles
Just to see you smile for me
I just need happiness
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
