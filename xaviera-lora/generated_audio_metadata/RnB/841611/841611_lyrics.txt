Baby what went wrong
The sun comes up
I wake up and you're gone
You left me on my own
But baby I'm not done
Play around and leave me in the night
Just tell me is that right? Oh no
Are you having fun?
You bring me down, you're playing with my heart
You've done it from the start, I know
Take me anywhere you like
Take me
I'll teach you to fight
I'll take you to the skies
Brush me deep beneath your skin
Let me right beside your heart
Take me down and drink me in
Take me out of your medicine
