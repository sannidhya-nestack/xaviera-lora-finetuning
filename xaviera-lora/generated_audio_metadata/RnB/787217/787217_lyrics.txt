You know how you just want to express yourself and let the world know how you're feeling
Just let them know what you feel inside
Know what I'm sayin'? You tell'em, girl
Listen up, y'all, I got something to say
Take your time now, don't hurt nobody
Tell me girl, what's on your mind?
I'm black and proud of it (alright now)
I love my culture
You can be my sister or my brother
Oh yeah, cause propaganda
I don't really matter
I'll take you just the way you are
Don't let it get you down, let it get you down
Don't let it get you down, no, no
In this society (yeah)
They all expect me (from me)
To sit and eat what they deliver
No no
But it ain't no shame (I hear you) making the game
As long as you can still cross that river
Yeah yeah (cause I'ma get across)
Don't let it get you down, let it get you down
Don't let it get you down, no no
Don't let it get you down, let it get you down
Don't let it get you down, no, no
If colour wasn't questioned
Then blindness all will be (all will be)
It's crime and people's ignorance
That makes up what we see (exactly what we see)
Don't let it get you down, let it get you down
Let it get you down, no, no
Don't let it get you down, let it get you down
Let it get you down, no, no
Don't you ever let it get you down, my sister
Always keep your head up
You hear this? Come on
Living in NYC
I could be what I wanna be
Even if I'm politically out of shape
Oh yeah
If I feel like sex tonight
Oh the lights are way too bright
I can cut through all this red tape, oh yeah
Don't let it get you down, let it get you down
Don't let it get you down, no, no, no
Don't let it get you down, let it get you down
Let it get you down, no, no
One more time, let me tell it
If color was in question
Blind is all we'll be
It's crime and people's ignorance
The made says what we see
Don't let it get you down, let it get you down
Let it get you down, no, no
Don't let it get you down, let it get you down
Let it get you down, no, no
Don't let it get you down, my sister
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't ever let it get you down, down, down, down, down
Don't let it get you down, never, never, never
Don't ever let it get you down, never, never, never, never
Don't let it get you down, yeah
Don't you ever let it get you down, my sister
We will be able to speed up our day (always keep your head up)
With all of God's children, black men and white men
Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics
We'll be able to join hands
And sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual
Free at last, free at last
Thank God Almighty, we are free after this
Free after this
Free after this
