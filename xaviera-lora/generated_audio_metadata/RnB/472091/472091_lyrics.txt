Four guys in a caddy, casting ready to go
On the road to Memphis, we ain't getting there slow
Got rockstar energy
Pickled Polish delight
Blowing through traffic
Driving the night
A flash of white in the dark
Just a bump in the night
Feeling acrobat
Taking terminal flight
Two hips for the kitty
Two hips for the kitty
Two hips for the kitty
Two hits for the kitty
We couldn't say hello before we said goodbye
He wasn't much to look at, but baby he could fly
The smell of burning rubber, it sure wasn't pretty
Pair of good year tires, packed full of little kitty
Two hits for the kitty, two hits for the kitty
Two hips for the kitty
Two hips for the kitty
He was warm and bright
Now he's cold and dead
Back flip on a moonlit night
Landed on his head
Two hits for the kitty
Two hits for the kitty
Two hits for the kitty
Two hits for the kitty
Two hits for the kitty
Two hits for the kitty
Two hits for the kitty
Two hits for me, kid
Two hands for a penny
Two hands for a penny
Two hands for a penny
Two hands for a penny
Two hands for a penny
Two hands for a penny
