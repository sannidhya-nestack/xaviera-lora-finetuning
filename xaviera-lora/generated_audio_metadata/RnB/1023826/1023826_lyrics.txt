It's cold outside (outside, outside)
But it's warm in here
And we're all right
Sit back and watch the rain
It doesn't happen everyday
In here right now, let's kick back
Lengthless (Lengthless)
It's cold outside
But it's warm in here
And we'll all walk for the floor
Go out and let me come back in to wait all again
Is the way that we go now I know
Mind always running, turn it down
Kick back, find a place where
You've got some quiet and still
Mind always running, turn it down
Kick back, you think this is love, now I catch your breath
Find a place where there's silence
Quiet as the night
As quiet as dark
Ooh
Go out and let me come back into it all again
La-da-da-da-da
You turn it down
Stop this stick around
Go out and let me come back in
