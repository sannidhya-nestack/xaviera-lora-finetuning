We go round and round but I like the thrill
Like a merry-go-round I love how it feels
We go up and down holding tight
It's a scary ride but I know that it's right
Sometimes I feel the fear in me
But you give me much security
As long as you're with me here by my side
I know nothing will go wrong on this ride
We go round and round but I like the thrill
But I like it like a merry-go-round
Like a merry-go-round I love how it feels
We go up
Up and down, and we hold each other tight
It's scary baby, but I know that it's right
The ups are good from the start
It's the downs that can't stop the rhythm of our hearts
These feelings and times are the very best
We'll have some bums
But baby don't stress
We go round and round
But I like this thrill
Like a merry-go-round
I love how it feels
Up and down, holding tight, it's a scary ride
It's scary baby, but I know that it's right
We go round and round, like the thrill
Like a merry-go-round, I love how it feels
Holding tight, it's a scary ride (a scary ride)
I know that it's right (but I know that it's right)
Round and around and around we go
How long this thing last no one will ever know
Let's show everybody how it's really done
How it can be scary or it can be fun
If you can't take the ups and downs
The bumps, the turns, the smiles and the frowns
Then everyone will know that we're not strong
The best thing to do is not to get on
We go round and round like a thrill
Like a merry-go-round I love how it feels
And I'm holding tight, it's a scary time, but I know that it's right, it's the right of my life, the right of my life, say, the right of my life, it's the right of my life
Whoa, whoa, it's the ride of my life, the ride of my life, say
The ride of my life, it's the ride of my life
It's the ride of my life, the ride of my life, say
The ride of my life, it's the ride of my life, whoa, whoa
It's the ride of my life, it's the ride of my life, say
The ride of my life, it's the ride on my life
