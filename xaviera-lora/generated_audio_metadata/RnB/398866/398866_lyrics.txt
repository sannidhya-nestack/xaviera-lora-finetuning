The collard greens and the black-eyed peas
The fried catfish and the mac and cheese
The grits and gravy, the chicken wings
She had to be digging into all them things
When I saw her she caught my eye
Made me think of sweet potato pie now
But when I saw her from behind
Grandma's ham hocks was on my mind
Must be something in the water
Had to be something in the water, babe
Keep it moving
The cornbread and the beans and rice
The country sausage watermelon slice
The BQ ribs and the chit-a-ling
She had to be digging into all them things
Now I just can't believe my eyes
No matter how hard I try now
Just one question and I'll be done
Where'd she get that rum rose from?
Must be something in the water
Had to be something in the water, babe
Can't believe that butter, oh, can't believe that butter
Must be something in the water
Can't believe that thing she got on her
(Flippin' somethin' in the water)
Had to be somethin' in the water, baby
(Can't believe the things you got on her)
Yeah, baby
(Flippin' somethin' in the water)
Had to be somethin' in the water, man
Need is tender and so divine
You wore that dress and she looks fine
I fill my plate up and I never stop
My mama said not to leave it dry
I guess I better get it lined
I can't wait to go get mine
I could never get enough
Grab me a biscuit and sop you up
Can't believe that girl, oh
Can't believe that, but I
Must be something in the wall
Can't believe that butter home (can't believe the butter home)
Must be something in the water (can't believe the things you got on her)
Must be something in the water
Can't believe the things she got on her (Can't believe the butter)
Can't believe the things that she got on her baby (What could be something in the water)
Can't believe the things she got on her (Can't believe the things that she got on her)
What could be something in the water (Had to be something in the)
Something in the water (Can't believe the things you got on her)
Can't believe the thing that she got on her (Something been something in the water)
Can't believe the things you got on her (Can't believe the things you got on her baby)
Something been something in the water (Can't believe the things you got on her)
