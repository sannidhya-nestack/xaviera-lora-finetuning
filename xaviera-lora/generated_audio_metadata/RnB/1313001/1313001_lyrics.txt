Take your love and leave
It's clear I made mistakes
Our ship is headed for the shoals
I hear the mirror break
And I still want love
But our ship is headed for the shoals
Take your love and leave
And that's when I felt like we hit a sandbar
And I had to work every night'til nine o'clock
And maybe sometimes things aren't meant to work out perfectly
And maybe sometimes things aren't meant to work out at all
And maybe things don't work out perfectly
I still want to love
But our ship is headed for the shoals
So take your love and leave
That's when I felt like we hit a sandbar
And I had to work every night till nine o'clock
And maybe sometimes things aren't meant to work out perfectly
It's hard to watch us drift apart
But I can't hold the line
I gave everything I had
Now I'm running out of time
I see you fading on the horizon
Lonely silhouette
Our ship is lost among the shoals
A memory I can't et
So take your love and leave
Cause that's all that's left for me
Take your love and leave
And let these waters set us free
I still wanna love
I still wanna love
But our ship is headed for the shoals
So take your love and leave
I see you fading on the horizon
Lonely silhouette
Our ship is lost among the shoals
A memory I can't et
So take your love and leave
Cause that's all that's left for me
Take your love and leave
And let these waters set us free
I still wanna love
But our ship is headed for the shoals
So take your love and leave
I see you fading on the horizon, lonely silhouette
Our ship is lost among the shoals, a memory I can't et
So take your love and leave, cause that's all that's left for me
Take your love and leave
And let these waters set us free
I still want love
I still want love
But I set it for the shows
So take your love and leave
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mm, mm, mm, mm
I still want love
But a ship is headed for the shores
So take your love and leave
