I see once, I see twice
Is the door closed for the third time
By checking once, I check twice
Is the door closed for the third time
Heart beats a little faster
Picturing all the kind of disaster
The catastrophe could be near
Is the door closed, I'll be sincere
I see once, I see twice
Is the door closed for the third time
But check once, check twice
Is the door closed for the third time
Maybe the fourth time would peace my mind
On the other hand these orders could go on for a while
Just need a last check to fix my pain
Because then I have to start all over again
See once, see twice
Is the door closed for the third time
But check once, check twice
Is the door closed for the third time
HM says it's alright
Jump to bed now, baby, let's have a good night
No, I think I see her at my door
The fifth time, make me sure
I see once, I see twice
Is the door closed for the third time?
I check it once, I check twice
Is the door closed for the third time?
HM says it's alright
Jump to bed now, baby, let's have a good night
No, I think I'll stick around my door
The fifth time will make me sure
I see it once, I see it twice
Is the door closed for the third time?
I check it once, I check it twice
Is the door closed for the third time?
I see it once, I see it twice
He's the door closed for the third time
A chink once, a chink twice
He's the door closed for the third time
See once, see twice, is the door closed for the third time
I check once, I check twice, is the door closed for the third time
See once, I see twice, is the door closed for the third time
I check once, I check twice, is the door closed for the third time
