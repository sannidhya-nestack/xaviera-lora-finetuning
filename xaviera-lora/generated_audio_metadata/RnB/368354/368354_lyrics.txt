Funny how love is blind
Can't see what's right in front of your eyes
Funny how quickly people tend to compromise
Start doing things they wouldn't otherwise
How did I get lost with no sense of pride
Now I see the cost, I got no feeling left inside
Tell me is love worth the price you pay
Give your all for someone just to take away
So here I am, what's left of me
boy you got the best of me
Now just as far as I can see
You and I will never be
No,'cause you can't have what's left of me
No, you can't have what's left of me
It took some time, but now I see
That losing you's not worth the price of me
It's time to move on
So I can be free
At least I've got my dignity
one day you'll be lost with no sense of pride
Then you'll see the cost, you'll have no feeling left inside
Tell me is love worth the price I pay
You'll give your all for someone just to take away
So here I am, what's left of me?
'Cause boy you got the best of me
Now just as far as I can see
You and I will never be, no
you can't have what's left of me
No you can't have what's left of me
Told you from the start
Couldn't trust you in my heart
But I gave it to you anyway
Now it's time I walk away
Ain't got nothing left to say
You'll learn your lesson one day
So here I am, so here I am
All that's left of me
for you got the best of me
Not just as far as I can see
You and I will never be, no
you can't have what's left of me
No, you can't have it, you can't have it, oh
No, you can't have what's left of me
