Wa wa wa wa
Oh you, what I've been praying for
For you, I knelt down on the floor with you
I'll stay forevermore with you, you're the answer to my prayer
Now I don't want nobody else, oh I just want you to myself
Oh I will never let you go, you're the answer to my prayer
There's no one else quite like you
You're like an angel from above
I know the darkness that you are
And you're the answer to my prayer
Ba-boo-ba-boo-ba-boo-ba-boo
Dum-dum-dum-dum
Doo-ba-doo-ba-doo
Dum-dum-dum-dum
Doo-ba-doo-ba-doo
Dum-dum-dum-dum
La, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You love, love, love
For what I've been praying for, for you
I'm down, down on my floor, but with you there
I'll stay forever more, but you're the answer to my prayer
There's no one else quite like you
You're like an angel from above
I know God has sent you
You're the answer to my prayer (dooba, dooba, dooba, dooba, dooba)
Oh, I don't want nobody else (dooba, dooba, dooba, dooba, dooba)
I just want you to myself (dooba, dooba, dooba, dooba, dooba)
Oh, I-I-I-I-I-I will never let you go (never let you go)
You're the answer to my prayer
Dum dum dum dum
Doo ba doo ba doo
Dum dum dum dum
Doo ba doo ba doo
Dum dum dum dum
You're the answer to my prayer
