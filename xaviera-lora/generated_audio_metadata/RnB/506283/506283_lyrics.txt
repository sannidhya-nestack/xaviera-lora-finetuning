When I first saw you, I knew I had to have you
Don't you run and hide from me
Girl of my very dreams
How my heart has longed for you
All of my life
Don't you know you stole my heart
Right from the very start
When first I laid my eyes on you
I just had to have you baby all to myself
I just want to let you know
That I'm coming for you, baby (I'm coming for you, baby)
Hey (I'm coming for you, baby)
And I don't want to let you go
I'm gonna get you, baby ('Cause I'm gonna get you, baby)
Yeah, girl of my very dreams
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Take my hand and have no fear
For I will be always near
To soothe your pain and ease your mind
I'll fulfill your every need
A lover, provider, and friend indeed
I'll comfort, protect you in every situation
You'll never want for anything, yeah
I am here to set you free
From all your worries, baby (from all your worries, baby)
All your worries, baby (all your worries, baby)
Don't you walk away from me
it's all about you (all about you)
It's all about you, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
You're the one I want, right or wrong, yeah
In my arms is where you belong
I wanna hold you and feel you close to me forever
I'll never, never, never, never let you go
Girl of my very dreams
When I first saw you out the dead door
I just knew you were the one for me (my fairy dreams)
(Girl of my fairy dreams)
So I'm letting you know, right here, right now
(I love you, I love you) I must have you, I've got to have you (I love you, I love you)
I will have you in my life
