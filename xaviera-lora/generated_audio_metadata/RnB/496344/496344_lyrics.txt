Oh, oh, oh
You know after all you put me through
There is not much more that I can do
After all the things you said and done
I don't have the strength to carry on
I had so many problems in my life
Even thought about making you my wife
But now it's just me
Sometimes I even wonder if you're aware
Or maybe you just don't even care
All the things you do, the things you've said
They all go directly to my head
We had so many plans, so many dreams
But things aren't always quite what they seem
Now all I can say
Enough is enough, I can't take you anymore
Oh enough is enough, all I want to see is you out that door
Oh enough is enough, so there will be no more pain (no more pain)
Never even dreamed we could get here
Thought we'd be together after a year
But it seems our time has come to pass
Now you're free at last
We won't have to act this out again
Looks like you'll just be my long lost friend
Silly how I could've been such a fool
I was just playing by your rules, your rules
Enough is enough, I can't take you anymore
Oh enough is enough, all I want to see is you out that door
Oh enough is enough, so there will be no more pain (no more pain)
Enough is enough, I can't take you anymore
Oh enough is enough, all I want to see is you out that door
Oh enough is enough, so there will be no more pain
No more pain
