Yeah, listen up, yeah
If I start to lose control, save it, save it
Soothe my mind and heal my soul, save it, save it
I can make it on my own, save it, save it
You can make it right, save our love tonight
Let your kisses show that you want me
You will never know how they touch me
I'm in overload
Can't keep myself from letting go
It's a crazy way that I'm feeling
And the words you say leave me reeling
I'm in ecstasy
Don't know where you are leading me
If I start to lose control
Save it, save it
Steal my mind and heal my soul
Save it, save it
I can make it on my own
Save it, save it
You can make it right
Save our love tonight
Boy you stole my heart
When I saw you
I'll do anything that you want to
You're my fantasy
Don't ever wake me from this dream
If I start to lose control, save me, save me
Soothe my mind and heal my soul, save me, save me
I can make it on my own
Save it, save it, you can make it right
Save our love tonight if I start to lose my mind
Save it, save it, you can stop the pain inside
Save it, save it
And we can make it if we try (Save our love, save our love)
Now it feels so right (You can make it right)
Save our love tonight (Save our love, save our love)
(Save our love, save our love, save our love) (Save our love, save our love, save our love)
You can make it right, yeah
You can make it right
Listen up, I wanna tell you about the way that I feel
Is this fantasy?
Save our love tonight
If I start to lose control
Save me, save me
Steal my mind and heal my soul
Save me, save me
I can make it on my own
Save me, save me
You can make it right
Save our love tonight
If I start to lose my mind
Save our love tonight
You can't stop the pain inside, save it (Save it, save it, save it)
We can make it if we try (Save it, save it, save it)
Now we feel so right, save our love tonight
