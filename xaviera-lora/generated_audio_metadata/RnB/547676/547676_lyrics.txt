Like a bolt of lightning, right from the start
You took my world by storm
Always a longing, here in my heart
you are my heart
I carry you inside my soul
To always feel your heart of gold
If the sun fell from the sky and it was bitter cold
I'd keep you warm right by my side till we grew old
So baby
Baby, can't you see I'm yours eternally?
you are my heaven, yeah
It ain't been easy, not always a charm
But we keep going strong
We pick up the pieces, walk on arm in arm
you are my
You give me light on the darkest day
Open my heart in your special way
If the sun fell from the sky and it was bitter cold
I'd keep you warm right by my side'til we grow so fair
But I can't you see I'm yours eternally
you are my heaven
I close my eyes a vision comes to me
A picture in my mind I see
Oh your beautiful smile
And your passionate style
Your love makes me all I can be
Sets me free
If the sun fell from the sky and it was bitter cold (I'll keep you warm right by my side) (I'll keep you warm right by my side'til we grow old) ('Til we grow old)
So baby can't you see I'm yours eternally (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,)'Cause you are my heaven (You are my heaven)
If the sun fell from the sky and it was bitter cold (I'll keep you warm right by my side)
