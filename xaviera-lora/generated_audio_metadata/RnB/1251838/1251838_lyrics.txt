Mmm, mmm, mmm
That glint in your eye
It's like a sky so high
We could touch the stars
Catch'em in our jars
Every time we smile
Feels like we're on a mile
Running in the sun
Having so much fun
Hey hey come on now
Let's make a vow
To shine bright all day all night
Hey hey we won't fall
We'll give it all
With that glimpse in your eye
Dust'til dawn, leave the clay
In our own way
Laugh'til we cry
Never asking why
Hold my hands high
We could climb this high
No fear, no doubt
Let's scream and shout
Hey, hey, come on now, let's make a vow
To shine bright all day, all night
Hey, hey, we won't fall, we'll give it all
With that glimpse in your eye
In your eye
Last till dawn we play
In our own way
Laugh till we cry
Never asking why
Hold my hand tight
We could climb this height
No fear no doubt
Let's scream and shout
Hey, hey, come on now, let's make a vow
To shine bright all day, all night
Hey, hey, we won't fall, we'll give it all
With that glimpse in your eye
In your eye
