Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, mmm
Each and every night
I think about you'til the morning light
A pair of big brown eyes
The perfect body and it's just my size
Your voice it goes right through me
Your body's talking to me
You got me feeling things I never ever felt before
I want you baby more than I care
To say you wanna kiss those lips when you touch my hips
When I hear you calling out my name
Do you want?
Wanna do the things I wanna do (Baby, do you wanna)
I wanna spend the night with you (Do you wanna)
Wanna do the things I wanna do
I wanna
Boy, I wanna spend the night with you
Dinner by candlelight
I'll make every moment feel so right
So long I've waited for you
Tell me baby what you wanna do
I whisper softly to ya
Just how I wanna do ya
Reach out and touch me baby I won't walk away
Just put it on me baby
Right here and now gonna make me hot
When you hit that spot gonna hear me calling out your name
Do you wanna
Wanna do the things I wanna do (Baby, do you want it?)
I wanna spend the night with you (Do you want it?)
Wanna do the things I wanna do ('Cause I wanna)
Boy, I wanna spend the night with you
Baby, hold up, know what? I like that
Don't talk back, go with the flow
Close your eyes, this is fallin' in zone
Now it's outta control, whoa
Like that? Oh yeah
Feelin' it now, the way you workin' the track
Got me feelin' like bangin' your back, hot damn
Let me freak that, haven't since the first time that I caught them eyes
Baby I had to know your name, so high I had to play your games
So fly I'ma take my time, even play this right
Like what's your name, baby what's you like?
We can ride, you know that's right
You know the kid nice, thug type
Hard on my sleeve, show you how to get right
Begging a kid like
I see you every day, I dream you every night
I can't take it anymore, I'm giving up this fight
Your body's calling me, and I just can't turn it down
So tell me just one thing, baby, do you wanna
Wanna do the things I wanna do? (Baby, do you wanna?)
I wanna spend the night with you (Do you wanna?)
Wanna do the things I wanna do'cause I wanna
Boy, I wanna spend the night with you
