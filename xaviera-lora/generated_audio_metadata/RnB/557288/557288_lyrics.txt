Give me something new
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Now the day goes by
When you're not on my mind
It's like every night
Need you by my side girl
Time after time
Girl I find myself acting like a fool
Nobody else could make me feel like you do
Girl you're everything (thing to me)
Everything that man could want (girl you're everything)
Girl you are my everything (thing to me)
Girl you're the only one that makes me
You're the only one that takes me
And shakes me and breaks me down
Girl you're the only one that makes me
You're the only one that takes me
And shakes me and breaks me down
Girl you got me going crazy
Girl every time I take a look into your eyes
You got me hooked just like a fish
Out of water when I'm not by your side
Girl you know I'm so into you I could just die
Everything that you say goes around in my mind like a replay
No I'm out of play and I don't wanna be played
Got no time for the he say she say and feelin' I'm crying when I'm trying to sleep
Boys in turn every night with the e-bitchy bass
Loving you girl is never easy
Still it's crazy, pay attention
Girl you're everything (think to me)
Everything that man could want (girl you're everything)
Girl you're everything (think to me)
Girl you're the only one that makes me
You're the only one that takes me
And shakes me and breaks me down
Girl you're the only one that makes me, you're the only one that takes me, and shakes me, and breaks me down (you make me feel alive, you make me feel alive)
Girl you're the only one that makes me, you're the only one that takes me, and shakes me, and breaks me down (you make me feel alive, you make me feel alive)
Girl you're the only one that makes me, you're the only one that takes me, and shakes me, and breaks me down
Girl you're the only one that makes me, you're the only one that takes me, and shakes and breaks me down
Girl, you the only one that makes me
You're the only one that takes me
And shakes me
And breaks me
Damn long (You make me feel alive, you make me feel alive)
(Should I be throwing my gun, boy, for some)
Girl, you got me going crazy (Should I be throwing my gun, boy, for some)
Only for you, baby (Should I be throwing my gun, boy, for some)
Tell me how you like it, baby
