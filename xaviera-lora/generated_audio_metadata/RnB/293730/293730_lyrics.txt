It was the summer
And you were wearing those blue, blue eyes
It was then I learned what I used to call an
Other disguise
Every time I thought of you
I should have known
I just felt I had to put my life aside
You were never messing with my body
But maybe you were surely messing with my mind, oh
Now I know I might be kinda far away
But I'm not giving up my only chance to sing
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
