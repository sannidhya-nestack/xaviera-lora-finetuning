Hanging out with some friends
Coming from far away
Searching for the right place
Where we could stay
Finally we found it
A perfect space to sway
Everyone was dancing
And the vibes were great
Then I saw you there looking at me
Couldn't wait a minute to get closer
When I said to you I found out that we were meant to be
When I looked into your eyes
You were so divine
I was quickly mesmerized
I found you
Wasn't hard to realize
You were so divine
You were just one of a kind
One of a kind
When I looked into your eyes
You were so divine
I was quickly mesmerized
I found you
Wasn't hard to realize
You were so divine
You were just one of a kind
One of a kind
Driven by the music vibes
I made the best decision
I came to find my twin soul
Following my intuition
So here we are right now
Living life our way
Making groups together
And surfing through the waves
When I saw you there looking at me
Couldn't wait a minute to get closer
When I talked to you found out that we were meant to be
When I looked into your eyes
You were so divine
I was quickly mesmerized
And I found you
Wasn't hard to realize
You were so divine
You were just one of a kind
One of a kind
When I looked into your eyes
You were so divine
I was quickly mesmerized
And I found you
Wasn't hard to realize
You were so divine, you were just one of a kind, one of a kind
So divine (so divine)
So divine (so divine)
So divine (so divine)
So divine
So divine (so divine)
So divine (so divine)
So divine, so
So divine
So divine
So divine
