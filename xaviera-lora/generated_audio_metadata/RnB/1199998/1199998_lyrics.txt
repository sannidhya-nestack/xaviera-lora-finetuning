I watch the midnight rain come down
All around
It's a stormy sea
I need to find the right way out
There's no doubt
That you're hurting me
Baby, don't you lie every single time
Baby, don't you try to defend your babies
Baby, can't you see you cause me misery
I don't want to play those games
In the midnight rain
We shelter from the darkest sky
You and I
Till the thaw is gone
But as the midnight rain dies down
Still you shout
It goes on and on and on and on
Baby don't you lie
Every single time
Baby don't you try
To defend your maze
Baby can't you see
You caused this misery
I don't want to play those games
Oh, in the midnight rain
Baby, don't you lie every single time
Baby, don't you try to defend your base
Baby, can't you see you caused this misery?
I don't want to play those games
Oh, in the middle of the rain
In the middle of the rain
In the midnight rain
