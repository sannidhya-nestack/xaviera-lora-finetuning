Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
I can't even find my senses
Can't breathe, can't sleep, you're on my mind
You make me lose my self control
Acting crazy, can't unwind
Ooh, I'm obsessed
Love obsessed
Love obsessed
It's all I can do to keep my head on
Can't think of anything but you
Cloudy, fuzzy, where's my mind gone?
I'd be cured if I had you
I'm obsessed, love obsessed, love obsessed
And if I don't think'bout you now every day
My heart gets so cold, so cold, yeah
I wanna touch you now in every way
I want you
Can't get enough of you, you need to fill me up with you
I gotta have you, yes I do
See right now, I'm spinning out of control
I need your body next to mine
Ooh, I'm obsessed, love obsessed, love obsessed
Just give me that sax
I'm out to find myself a doctor
I think I'm lovesick with desire
Baby, all I need is you
Turnin' up my heart's on fire
Ooh, I'm obsessed, obsessed, obsessed, obsessed, obsessed
Ooh, I'm obsessed, obsessed, obsessed
