I can't get you out of my mind
Don't tell me it's over
I've been thinking'bout the good times
Don't you want some more?
Was it all those days or something more?
Please tell me baby
I'd really like to know for sure
Don't you want some more?
Keep it coming baby
I need your loving baby
Keep it coming (keep it coming)
'Cause I just can't wait
Keep it coming baby
I need your loving baby
Keep it coming (keep it coming)
I just can't wait
I don't wanna think of you as just a honey (oh no)
I just want your loving baby and I can't wait (oh no)
I don't wanna think of you as just a honey (oh no)
I just want your lovin' baby and I just can't wait
Talk to me baby, tell me all about it
Couldn't you tell that I loved you?
Don't you want some more?
Didn't you know I was goin' on?
Couldn't you tell I was comin' on strong?
Ooh, don't you want some more?
I don't wanna think of you as just a heartache
Oh no
I just want your lovin' baby and I can't wait
Oh no
I don't want to think of you as just a heartache (oh no)
I just want your love and baby and I just can't wait
Just can't wait baby baby
Keep it coming, this can't wait
Keep it coming baby, I need your loving baby
Keep it coming, keep it coming, cause I just can't wait
Keep it coming baby, I need your loving baby
Keep it coming, keep it coming, cause I just can't wait
I need your loving baby, said keep it coming baby
Cause I just can't wait
Keep it coming baby, I need your loving baby
And I just can't wait
