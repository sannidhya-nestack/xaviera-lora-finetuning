They say you can't be sure in love
When you give your heart away
That unmatched man up in heaven
Ah baby
We'll
But I'd rather stay that way
When I wake up in the morning
I can't wait to see your face
Wanna tell you just how much you mean to me
There has never been nobody
That touches me the way you do
And when I look in your eyes
I realize you're the closest thing to heaven
I just wanna love you forever
Oh baby, you're the closest thing to heaven
I want to hold you for the rest of my life
Commitment I didn't understand
My eyes
Until my eyes saw you and the serious began
Your kisses make my body weak
Oh yeah
I knew you were the one for me
When I wake up in the morning
I can't wait to see your face
I wanna tell you just how much you mean to me
There has never been nobody who touches me the way you do
And when I look in your eyes
I realize I'm on the closest thing to heaven
I just wanna love you forever
Oh baby, you're the closest thing to heaven
I wanna hold you for the rest of my life
When I wake up in the morning
I can't wait to see your face
I wanna tell you just how much you mean to me
There has never been nobody
Who touches me the way you do
When I look in your eyes
I realize love flows this way
To heaven
I just wanna love you forever
You're the closest thing to heaven
I wanna hold you for the rest of my life
You're the closest thing to heaven
I just wanna love you forever (I just wanna love you, baby)
You're the closest thing to heaven
