I know there's something that is going on
It ain't so bad when the feeling's so wrong
So can you tell me where it's coming from?
I see the signs and I see them in the song
I know there's something that is going on
It ain't so bad when the feeling's so wrong
So can you tell me where it's coming from
I see the signs and I see them in the song
I ain't so stupid, no no
Don't think you can see
These things are happening, oh no
You ain't fooling me, no, no, I ain't so stupid
Why can't you see?
I won't be fooled by you, no, no, no, no, by any degree
I know there's something that is going on that ain't so right when the feeling's so wrong
So can you tell me where it's coming from? I see those signs on the seat down in song
I know there's something that is going on that ain't so right when the feeling's so wrong
So can you tell me where it's coming from? I see little signs and the signal is strong
I ain't so stupid, no, no
Don't think I can see these things are happening, no, no
You ain't fooling me, no, no, no, no
You ain't foolin' me
You ain't foolin' me, no, no, no
I know there's something that is going on
That ain't so right when the feeling's so wrong
So can you tell me where it's coming from?
I see the signs and the signal is strong
I know there's something that is going on
That ain't so right when the feeling's so wrong
So can you tell me where it's coming from?
I see the signs and the signal is strong
So full of shadow, why can't you see?
These things are happening
You ain't fooling me, no
I ain't so stupid, oh no, why can't you see?
I won't be fooled by you, no
By any degree, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
