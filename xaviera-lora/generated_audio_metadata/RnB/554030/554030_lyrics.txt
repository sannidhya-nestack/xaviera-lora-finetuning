I'm gonna run, run away
Yes, I'm gonna run, run far
I'm gonna run to where they can't find me
Maybe down to New Orleans
I'm gonna run, yes, I'm gonna run
Where the time stands still
And there's magic in the air
Give me another cup of joe
I'm not going anywhere
And I wanna go see the show
And I heard there's room for one more
I gotta run
Yes, I gotta run
I gotta run, you know I gotta run, run for me baby
I gotta run, run away
Yes, I gotta run, far from this place
I think I'll just find my way to a place they play the blues all day
I gotta run, yes, I gotta run
I gotta run, you know I gotta run away
I'm gonna run
I'm gonna run, run, run, run, run away
