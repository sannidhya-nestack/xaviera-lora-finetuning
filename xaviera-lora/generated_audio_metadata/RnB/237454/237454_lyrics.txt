We've gone our separate ways and though we're apart
I need to share what's in my heart
I hope the bird of paradise takes you under wing
I hope all your memories make your heart sing
I hope you receive everything you dream of
Hope springs eternal
And so does my love
My love is forever my love
My love is forever forever my love
Forever and ever forever my love
Yes love is forever my love
I hope your lips taste the rarest of sweet wine
I hope your lips remember the taste of mine
Everything, yes everything is divine and comes from above
Heaven is eternal and so is my love
My love is forever my love
My love is forever, forever my love
Forever and ever, forever my love
Yes, love is forever, forever my love
Even as I face the reality
My love transcends the finality of losing you
Wherever it is I'm moving to I know
I'll keep on loving you so
I hope through your castle gentle breezes blow
And up to the stars all your endeavors flow
I hope you know that hope comes from above
Hope springs eternal love and so does my love
My love is forever (forever my love)
Love is forever (forever my love)
Forever my love
Forever and ever
Forever my love
Yes, my love is forever
Forever my love
My love is forever
Forever my love
Ever and ever (forever my love)
My love goes on and on (forever my love)
Even though you're gone (forever my love)
My love is forever (forever my love)
My love is forever (forever my love)
My love is forever
Forever my love, forever my love, forever my love
